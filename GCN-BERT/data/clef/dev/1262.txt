Example 76: Synthesis of compound 11356, N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)propionamide
[Sep 1] Synthesis of methyl 3-fluoro-4-((N-(3-fluorophenyl)propionamido)methyl)benzoate
Methyl 3-fluoro-4-(((3-fluorophenyl)amino)methyl)benzoate (0.100 g, 0.361 mmol), synthesized in step 2 of Example 73, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.126 mL, 0.721 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and propionyl chloride (0.041 mL, 0.469 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 4 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 50%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.100 g, 83.2%) as colorless oil.
