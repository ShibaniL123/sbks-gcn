Synthesis of 2-butylthiochroman-4-one (10b)
340 mg trans-2-heptenic acid (2.65 mmol) was solved in 1.0 ml dry DCM in a Schleck tube with a septum under nitrogen. 0.27 ml Thiophenol (2.65 mmol) was added and the mixture was cooled with an ice-bath. Under nitrogen 2.5 ml trifluoromethanesulfonic acid was added and the mixture stirred at 0°C for 5 min. After that, the mixture was heated in an oil bath at 130 °C with a reflux cooler for 5 min. the reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature and was poured on ice. DCM was added and the phases separated. The water phase was washed with DCM and the combined organic phases washed twice with sat. NaHCO3 sol. and Brine. The organic phases was dried with MgSO4, filtered and the solved evaporated. The product was purified by column chromatography on silica 60 with PE/DCM 1:1. The product was obtained as slightly yellow oil (m = 198 mg, 34 %). Rf = 0.43 (PE/DCM 1:1).
