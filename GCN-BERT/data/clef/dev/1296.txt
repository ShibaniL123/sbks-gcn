1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-α-[N-(2-sulphoethyl)carbamoyl] benzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine ammonium salt
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-[N-((R)-α-carboxybenzyl) carbamoylmethoxy]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Example 25; 50mg, 0.078mmol) was dissolved in 3ml DCM. Tetrabutylammonium taurine (88mg, 0.236mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. TBTU (30mg, 0.093mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight. The solution was concentrated and purified by preparative HPLC using a C8 column (50x250mm). A gradient (20/80 to 60/40) of MeCN/0.1M ammonium acetate buffer was used as eluent. Lyophilization yielded 43mg of a product mixture, which was further purified by flash chromatography (5g) using a gradient of 3-20% MeOH in DCM as eluent. The fractions containing the title compound were collected and concentrated. MeOH and water were added and lyophilization yielded 17mg (29% yield).
