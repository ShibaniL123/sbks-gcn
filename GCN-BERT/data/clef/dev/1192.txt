Preparation of compound 1-d.
Compound 1-e (5.0 g, 20.08 mmol) was dissolved in acetone (100 mL), anhydrous potassium carbonate (4.2 g, 30.12 mmol) was added, methyl iodide (4.3 g, 30.12 mmol) was slowly added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filter cake was washed with acetone (100 mL) and the combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (150 mL) and diluted with water (100 mL). The separated organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to deliver a pale yellow solid 1-d (3.1 g, yield: 59%), this product was used without further purification.
