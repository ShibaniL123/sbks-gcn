Synthesis of compound I-1118
Step 1
The compound 51 (900 mg, 5.35 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (10 mL). Silver(II) fluoride (2.34 g, 16.06 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture was warmed to 50°C, and vigorously stirred for 3 hours. Silver(II) fluoride (1.56 g, 10.70 mmol) was further added to the mixture. The mixture was vigorously stirred at 50°C for 2.5 hours. Silver(II) fluoride (0.78 g, 5.35 mmol) was further added to the mixture. The mixture was vigorously stirred at 50°C for 2 hours. Under ice cooling, the saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate was added to the reaction mixture. Insoluble materials were filtered off. The filtrate was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by water and brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane) to give the compound 52 (374 mg, yield 38%).
