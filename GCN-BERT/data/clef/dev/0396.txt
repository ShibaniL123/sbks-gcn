Example 7
Synthesis of 8-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-(3-fluoro-5-methylsulfonyl-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-1,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]cquinolin-2-one (Compound Example 201)
i. 8-(1,3-Dimethylpyrazol-4-yl)-1-(3-fluoro-5-hydroxy-2-pyridyl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one (80 mg, 0.18 mmol, 98%), N,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml), potassium carbonate (50 mg, 0.36 mmol) and chloro(methylsulfanyl)methane (110 mg, 1.09 mmol, 95%) were initially introduced in a 25 ml round-bottomed flask. The solution was stirred overnight at 25Â° C. The reaction was then terminated by addition of 50 ml of water. The solution was extracted four times with 30 ml of ethyl acetate each time, and the organic phases were combined. The mixture was evaporated in vacuo. The residue was pre-purified on silica gel with MeOH:Et0Ac (6:94), giving 80 mg (85%) of 8-(1,3-dimethylpyrazol-4-yl)-1-[3-fluoro-5-(methylsulfanyl methoxy)-2-pyridyl]-7-methoxy-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one as yellow solid.
