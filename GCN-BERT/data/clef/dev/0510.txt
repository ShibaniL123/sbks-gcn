Step 3. 3-(4-Aminoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-N-(4-cyanobicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-1-yl)benzenesulfonamide
A microwave vial was charged with N-(4-cyanobicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-1-yl)-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide (70.0 mg, 0.180 mmol), 7-bromoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine (46 mg, 0.22 mmol, Synthonix) and THF (1.8 mL), followed by the addition of 1 M aq. K2CO3 (0.54 mL, 0.54 mmol). The reaction mixture was degassed and heated to 90Â° C. for 3.5 hours. Upon cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was partitioned between water and EtOAc. The aqueous layer was extracted with two further portions of EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The product was purified by flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient from 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes to afford a white solid (68 mg, 95%). LCMS for C18H18N7O2S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=396.1, found 396.1.
