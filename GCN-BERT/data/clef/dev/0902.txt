Example 54-2 : Preparation of 4-chloro-6-(5-methoxy-[2,4'-bipyridin]-6-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine
4-(6-Bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-6-chloropyrimidin-2-amine (26 mg, 82.39 µmol) and pyridin-4-ylboronic acid (12.15 mg, 98.87 µmol) were dissolved in dioxane (300 µL). To the resulting solution were added dropwise potassium phosphate (K3PO4) (52.47 mg, 247.18 µmol) dissolved in distilled water (100 µL) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) (4.76 mg, 4.12 µmol). The solution was refluxed with heat for 24 hrs, cooled, evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate, and diluted with distilled water and dichloromethane. The resulting solid was filtered, washed with diethylether, and dried to give the title compound (7.6 mg, 29 %).
