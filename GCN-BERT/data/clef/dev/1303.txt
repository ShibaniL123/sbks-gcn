46.3: (5-benzyl-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-acetic acid
75.6 mg (0.6 mmol) of potassium carbonate and 27 μl (0.4 mmol) of iodomethane are added to a solution of (5-benzyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl acetate in 5 ml of dimethylformamide. The reaction mixture is heated at 50° C. for 1.5 h. 0.6 ml (0.6 mmol) of a 1M aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide is added with 1 ml of water and 2.5 ml of tetrahydrofuran. After stirring for 20 hours at room temperature, the mixture is hydrolysed with 1N aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid and then diluted with ethyl acetate. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are combined, washed twice with water and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. 100 mg (100%) of (5-benzyl-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-acetic acid is obtained in the form of a colourless oil.
