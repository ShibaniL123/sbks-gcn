Preparation of (R)-N-(1-(3-amino-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-yl)-1-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxamide
(R)-3-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methylaniline (1.70 g, 10.4 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (29.9 mL) and treated with 1-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (1.00 g, 9.61 mmol), HATU (4.02 g, 10.6 mmol), and TEA (2.68 mL, 19.22 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours and then quenched with water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was dried under vacuum overnight to remove residual DMF. The residue was then adsorbed onto silica and purified by flash column silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 80% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford (R)-N-(1-(3-amino-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-yl)-1-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxamide (1.47 g, 61.1%) as a light yellow solid.
