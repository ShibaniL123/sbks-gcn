Step 3: Preparation of 5-(benzyloxy)-2-[4-(benzyloxy)phenyl]-3-methyl-1H-indole
In a 250 mL round bottom flask, 4-(benzyloxy)aniline (8.8 g, 44.34 mmol, 3.00 equiv) was added to a solution of 1-[4-(benzyloxy)phenyl]propan-1-one (4.3 g, 17.89 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in DMF/TEA (40/4.3 mL). The resulting solution was stirred for 6 hours at 125° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of water. The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL×3) and the organic layers were combined, washed with brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was applied onto a silica gel column eluting with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:5). This resulted in 1.7 g (23%) of 5-(benzyloxy)-2-[4-(benzyloxy)phenyl]-3-methyl-1H-indole as a light brown solid.
