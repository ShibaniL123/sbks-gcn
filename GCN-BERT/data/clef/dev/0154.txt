(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(6-(1-met hyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(6-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl )phenyl)acrylate 61e (25 mg, 0.0435 mmol) was dissolved in the 4 mL of a mxiture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol (V/V=3:1), then 0.22 mL of 1 M lithium hydroxide solution was added. The reaction was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. 10% citric acid solution was added to adjust the pH to 3-4. 20 mL of ethyl acetate was added, then the reaction mixture was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by thin layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(6-(1-met hyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid 61 (10 mg, yield 41%) as a yellow solid.
