Exemplary Scheme:
7-Bromo-4-(pyridin-2-yl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[b] [1,4]oxazine (1)
7-bromo-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine (200 mg, 0.934 mmol, 1.00 eq) was dissolved in DMF (4.7 mL) and sodium hydride (74.8 mg, 1.87 mmol, 2.00 eq) was added. The reaction was stirred for 5 minutes at which point 2-fluoropyridine (181 mg, 1.87 mmol, 2.00 eq) was added and followed by heating in a microwave reactor at 150° C. for 20 minutes. The reaction was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with water (2×). The aqueous layer was back extracted with ethyl acetate and the combined organics were dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by flash chromatography on silica gel using 0-20% hexanes/ethyl acetate afforded 140 mg (51%) of the title compound as a brown oil.
