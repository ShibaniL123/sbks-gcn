Step 4: Preparation of methyl 6-(4-(tert-butyl)phenoxy)-2-(1-(N-(2-methoxy-2- oxoethyl)-4-toluenesulfonylamino)ethyl) nicotinate
A 100 mL eggplant flask was sequentially charged with methyl 2-(1-bromoethyl)-6-(4-(tert-butyl)phenoxy) nicotinate (2.48 g,6.32 mmol) prepared in step 3, p-toluenesulfonylglycine methyl ester (1.53 g, 6.32 mmol) and potassium carbonate (1.75 g,12.64 mmol) and sodium iodide (95 mg, 0.63 mmol) and 15 ml of N, N-dimethylformamide for dissolving them. The mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 10 hours. Thin layer chromatography [V (petroleum ether) / V (ethyl acetate) = 2/1] detected that the reaction was basically completed, and the reaction solution was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water, extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL × 3). The organic phases were combined, washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate was mixed with crude silica gel, and subjected to flash column chromatography on silica gel column, eluting with V (petroleum ether) / V (ethyl acetate) = 4/1. The fraction was evaporated to dryness to obtain 0.93 g of methyl 6-(4-(tert-butyl)phenoxy)-2-(1-(N-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4-toluenesulfonylamino) ethyl) nicotinate, 26.49%.
