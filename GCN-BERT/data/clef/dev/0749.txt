Synthesis of compound 6-a
Under N2 atmosphere, ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (190mg, 1mmol) and potassium carbonate (138mg, 1mmol) were added to a solution of compound 6-b (75mg, 0.3mmol) in acetonitrile (4mL), the mixture was reacted for 3hrs at 80°C. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was filtered through celite, the filtrate cake was washed with EA (50mL). The filtrate was in turn washed with water (8mL×3) and saturated brine (10mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica column chromatography (PE:EA = 3:1) to give yellow liquid 6-a (56 mg, yield 52%).
