Example 51A
5-Methyl-2,4-dioxo-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbaldehyde
14.33 ml (153.76 mmol) of phosphorus oxychloride were added cautiously, while cooling with an ice bath, to a solution of 4.67 g (15.37 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 45A in 143 ml of DMF. The mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 5 h. Then the reaction mixture was concentrated very substantially on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was added to ice-water and stirred. The precipitated product was filtered off with suction, washed to neutrality with water and dried. 4.52 g (99% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
