Example 52-2 : Preparation of 6-(2'-amino-3'-fluoro-5-methoxy-[2,4'-bipyridin]-6-yl-N4,N4-dimethylpyrimidin-2,4-diamine (LXXV)
6-(6-Bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-N4,N4-dimethylpyrimidin-2,4-diamine (214.49 mg, 661.65 µmol) and 2-[3-fluoro-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolan-2-yl)-2-pyridinyl]-imidodicarbonic acid-1,3-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)ester (580 mg, 1.32 mmol) obtained in Preparation Example 1 were dissolved in dioxane (6 mL). To the resulting solution were added dropwise potassium phosphate (K3PO4) (421.34 mg, 1.98 mmol) dissolved in distilled water (3 mL) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) (38.26 mg, 33.08 µmol). The solution was refluxed with heat for 24 hrs, cooled, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The solution was diluted with distilled water and dichloromethane and then the resulting solid was filtered, washed with diethylether, and dried to give the title compound (96 mg, 41 %).
