Preparation of compound 39-d.
Compound 39-e (350 mg, 0.93 mmol), dimethylsulfoxide (88 mg, 1.12 mmol) and concentrated sulfuric acid (51 mg, 0.51 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (3 mL) and water (1 mL). The reaction mixture was cooled to 0°C and a solution of sodium chlorite (116 mg, 1.39 mmol) in water (2 mL) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred at this temperature for 30 minutes and then allowed to warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was diluted with water (50 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL × 3). The combined organic phases were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to deliver a pale yellow solid 39-d (170 mg, yield: 47%). This product was used without further purification.
