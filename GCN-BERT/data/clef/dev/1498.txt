2-bromo-4-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-5-methoxypyridine
(2-Bromo-5-methoxypyridin-4-yl)methanol (Anichem; 0.500 g, 2.293 mmol), tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMS-Cl, 0.415 g, 2.75 mmol), and imidazole (0.234 g, 3.44 mmol) were stirred in CH2Cl2 (10 mL) for 3 days at room temperature. After this time, the mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 and washed with water and brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to provide the title compound 2-bromo-4-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-5-methoxypyridine (0.660 g, 87% yield).
