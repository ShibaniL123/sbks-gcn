(Reference Example 5) Synthesis of 1-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)ethanone:
Pyridine (0.922 mL, 9.75 mmol) and acetic anhydride (0.946 mL, 11.7 mmol) were added to a solution of 4-dimethylaminopiperidine (1.00 g, 7.79 mmol) in dichloromethane (7.8 mL) at 0Â°C and the reaction liquid was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. A saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate was added to the reaction liquid, and the reaction liquid was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (NH silica gel, chloroform/methanol) to obtain 1-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)ethanone (0.869 g, 6.78 mmol, 87%) as a colorless oil.
