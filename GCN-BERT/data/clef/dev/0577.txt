[EXAMPLE 6]
Synthesis of compounds 1-037 and 1-038
Step 1 Synthesis of compound 37b
The compound 37a (5.00 g, 31.9 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (50 ml). Under ice cooling, a solution of diphenyldiazomethane (8.04 g, 41.4 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 ml) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, followed by elution with hexane/ethyl acetate. Fractions containing the desired compound were concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the compound 37b (9.86 g, 96%).
