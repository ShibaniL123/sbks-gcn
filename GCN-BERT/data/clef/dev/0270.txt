Preparation of tert-butyl 3-(4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenoxy)azetidine-1-carboxylate
Diethyl (E)-diazene-1,2-dicarboxylate (88 mg, 0.20 mmol) was added to a solution of 4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenol (94 mg, 0.20 mmol), tert-butyl 3-hydroxyazetidine-1-carboxylate (35 mg, 0.20 mmol), triphenylphosphine (53 mg, 0.20 mmol) and toluene (2.03 mL). The reaction was then warmed to 110Â° C. After 15 hours, the reactions as cooled, concentrated under reduced pressure, and purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 30% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford tert-butyl 3-(4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenoxy)azetidine-1-carboxylate (95 mg, 75%). m/z: ES+ [M+H]+ 621.
