(10) Preparation of (2R,5R)-2-((2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate
At 0Â°C, tetra(n-butyl)ammonium (2R,5R)-2-((2-(tert-butoxylcarbonyl)-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicycl o[3.2.1]octan-6-yl sulfate (0.17 g, 0.24 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (2 mL), then trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was added.. After reaction for 0.5 h, the reaction solution was poured into acetonitrile (10 mL), solid was precipitated, then isopropanol (5 mL) was added, filtrated, the filter cake was washed with acetonitrile (10 mL), and dried to obtain the product (50 mg, yield was 57.8 %),
