(Comparative) Example 4: Synthesis of PQS (Compound 4)
Synthesis of 1-chloro-2-nonanone (4a)
0.134 g Magnesium (5.54 mmol) and THF (5.5 ml) were stirred under an argon atmosphere.0.87 ml 1-Bromoheptane (4.85 mmol) was added and the reaction vessel was flushed with argon. The reaction was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and afterwards added to a solution of N-methoxy-N-methylchloroacetamide (0.500 g, 3.69 mmol) in toluene (5 ml) and THF (10 ml) at 0Â°C. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 h. To this solution was added cold 2M HCl (5 ml) and the layers were separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with n-hexane (3x50ml). The combined organic layers were washed with Brine solution (3x50ml), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. The solvent was evaporated and the product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using hexane/ethyl acetate (9:1). The product was obtained as a yellow oil (m = 0.480 g, 74 %). Rf = 0.65 (hexane/ethyl acetate 9:1).
