Step 7: Preparation of 2-(3-(4-(2-aminobenzo[d]oxazole-7-yl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl)-1-(methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl)acetonitrile
To 2-(3-(4-(3-amino-2-hydroxypheyl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl)-1- (methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl)acetonitrile (300 mg, 863.58 umol) in ethyl acetate (10 mL) solution was added cyanogen bromide(100 mg, 944.1 umol) under the protection of nitrogen. The mixture was stirred at 50Â°C for reacting for 12 hours. LC-MS and TLC(DCM:MeOH=10:1) detected and showed that the reaction was completed. After the reaction mixture was directly spun dry, dissolved in DCM:MeOH=10:1(3 mL), separated and purified through preparative TLC(DCM:MeOH=10:1) to give 2-(3-(4-(2-aminobenzo[d] oxazole-7-yl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl)-1- (methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl)acetonitrile (200 mg, 56.0% yield) as a yellow solid.
