(Reference Example 18) Synthesis of 1-propyl-1H-imidazole:
Sodium hydride (55%, 0.966 g, 22.1 mmol) was added to a solution of imidazole (1.37 g, 20.1 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (50.0 mL) at room temperature. The reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour, and then, 1-bromopropane (5.48 mL, 60.3 mmol) was added at room temperature. The reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 16 hours. The reaction liquid was filtered through Celite and washed with tetrahydrofuran, and then the filtrate and the washing solution were concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, chloroform/methanol) to obtain 1-propylimidazole (2.07 g, 18.8 mmol, 93%) as a colorless oil.
