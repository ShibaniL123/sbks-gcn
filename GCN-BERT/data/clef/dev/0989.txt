(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetr ahydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
N-(1-(benzo[b]thiophen-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine
1-(benzo[b]thiophen-3-yl)propan-2-amine 5a (100 mg, 0.523 mmol, prepared by a well-known method disclosed in "Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, 13(14), 4450-4457"), 2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 1b (152 mg, 0.680 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (135 mg, 1.046 mmol) were dissolved in 4 mL of 1,4-dioxane. After stirring for 3 hours at 90Â°C, the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound N-(1-(benzo[b]thiophen-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine 5b (100 mg, yield 72%) as a yellow oil.
