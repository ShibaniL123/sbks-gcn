Step 1
(5-Bromopyridin-3-yl)methanol (49)
To a stirred solution of methyl 5-bromonicotinate (10 g, 43.47 mmol) in methanol (100 mL) NaBH4 (6.5 g, 260.0 mmol) was added portion wise at 0° C. The reaction mixture was allowed warm to room temperature and stirred at 50° C. for 16 h. The solvents were removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was diluted with ice-cold water (100 mL) and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (3×150 mL); the combined organic layer was washed with brine (2×150 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford (5-bromopyridin-3-yl)methanol (6.5 g, yield: 74%, LC/MS: 99%) as an off-white solid. NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ 8.58 (d, J=2.0 Hz, 1H), 8.48 (d, J=2.0 Hz, 1H), 7.90 (t, J=2.0 Hz, 1H), 4.73 (s, 2H), 2.47 (bs, 1H).
