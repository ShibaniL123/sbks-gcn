Example 1: Preparation of (2S,5R)-2-(7-azaspiro[3.5]nonan-2-ylcarbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate (Compound 1)
(1) Preparation of tert-butyl 2-((2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxamido)-7-azaspiro[3.5]non ane-7-carboxylate
(2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylic acid (767 mg, 2.8 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (35 mL), tert-butyl 2-amino-7-azaspiro[3.5]nonane-7-carboxylate (1.0 g, 4.2 mmol), 1-hydroxylbenzotriazole (567 mg, 4.2 mmol), triethylamine (848 mg, 8.4 mmol) and 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (806 mg, 4.2 mmol) were serially added, stirred at 25Â°C for 16 h. Water (200 mL) and dichloromethane (200 mL) were added, the phases were separated, the organic phase was washed with saturated brine (200 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated, and the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate =1:1) to obtain the title compound (1.0 g, yield 71.7 %).
