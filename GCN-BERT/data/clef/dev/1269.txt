Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
3,4-Dihydro-2H-pyran (0.103 mL, 1.13 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (2 mg, 0.01 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (104 mg, 0.23 mmol) in DCM (1.5 mL). The reaction was maintained under reflux conditions for 1 hour. After cooling, the reaction was diluted with DCM, washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 30% EtOAc in hexanes. Product fractions were concentrated to dryness to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (117 mg, 95%) as pale yellow solid. m/z: ES+ [M+H]+ 544.
