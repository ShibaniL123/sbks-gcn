Example 11
Synthesis of 4-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (54 mg, 0.15 mmol), 2-methoxyisonicotinic acid (54 mg, 0.35 mmol), triethylamine (140 ÂµL, 1.00 mmol), and HATU (195 mg, 0.51 mmol) were reacted. To the reaction solution, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, and then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was suspended in chloroform, and then the suspension was washed with 6% aqueous ammonia. The aqueous layer was extracted with chloroform, the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, then the insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was subjected to column chromatography (aminosilica gel, 16 g) using methanol containing 10% concentrated aqueous ammonia and chloroform as the elution solvent to obtain ((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-1,2,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-3H-6, 11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-3-yl)(2-methoxypyridin-4-yl)methanone (61 mg, 82%) as white solid.
