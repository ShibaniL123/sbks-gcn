(E)-methyl3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-acetoxy-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7-formyl-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7-formyl-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl) phenyl)acrylate 77a (300 mg, 0.65 mmol) and sodium acetate (160 mg, 1.95 mmol) were dissolved in 9 mL of acetic anhydride. The reaction mixture was warmed up to 150Â°C and stirred for 12 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromotography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-acetoxy-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7-formyl-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 77b (150 mg, yield 47.5%) as a colorless oil.
