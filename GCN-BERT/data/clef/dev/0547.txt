(3) Preparation of tert-butyl 8-((2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxamido)-3-azabicyclo[ 3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylate
(2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylic acid (0.56 g, 2.03 mmol), tert-butyl 8-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylate (0.46 g, 2.03 mmol), 1-hydroxylbenzotriazole (0.3 g, 2.22 mmol), 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (0.8 g, 4.17 mmol) and triethylamine (0.4 g, 3.9 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL), stirred and reacted under nitrogen gas protection at 25 Â°C for 16 h. The reaction solution was concentrated, and the obtained crude product was separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate =1:1) to obtain the title compound as a colorless gum (0.52 g, yield 53.1 %).
