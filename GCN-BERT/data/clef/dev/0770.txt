Example 8-2 : Preparation of 2'-amino-6'-(2-aminopyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-[2,4'-bipyridin]-5-ol (LXIII)
6-(2-amino-pyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-5-methoxy-[2,4']bipyridin-2'-ylamine (LXII) (210 mg, 0.672 mmol) was mixed with pyridine hydrochloride (Pyridine HCl) (790 mg, 6.720 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at 170 Â°C for 1 hr. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, neutralized with 2 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, and diluted with ethylacetate (EA). Then, the organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate to give the title compound (170 mg, 85 %).
