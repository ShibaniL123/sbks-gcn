Step 3
3,7-Dimethyl-1-(3-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)propyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
3-(3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)propyl methanesulfonate (100 mg, 0.450 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous N,N-methylformamide (5 mL). Potassium carbonate (126 mg, 0.900 mmol), potassium iodide (8.0 mg, 0.045 mmol) and 2,6-hydroxy-3,7-dimethylpurine (98.0 mg, 0.550 mmol) were added at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction solution was heated to 130Â°C and stirred for 3 hours. Water (40 mL) was added to quench the reaction, and the reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined, washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (30 mL x 2), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting product was purified by preparative HPLC to give 3,7-dimethyl-1-(3-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)propyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (23.0 mg) with a yield of 16%.
