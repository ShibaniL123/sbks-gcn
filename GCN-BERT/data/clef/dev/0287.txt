Example 2 (Referenece)
4-amino-2-(2-oxopiperidin-3-yl)isoindoline-1,3-dione (28). To a solution of 3-aminophthalic acid (0.100 g, 0.552 mmol) in DMF (1.1 mL) was added 3-aminopiperidine-2-one (0.063 g, 0.552 mmol) and the reaction was stirred at 90 Â°C over 18 h. Volatiles were removed in vacuo and the dark-brown crude residue was purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC to give the desired product 28 (0.050 g, 35%) as an off-white powder.
