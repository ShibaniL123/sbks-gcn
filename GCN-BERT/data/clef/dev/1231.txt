Manganese dioxide (33.4 g, 384 mmol) was added to a suspension of (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-{[5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]amino}-1-methylcyclo-pentanol (1c, 6.9 g, 25.6 mmol) in EtOAc (384 mL), and the mixture stirred in a 50° C. oil bath for 7 h, and then at room temperature overnight. Solids were removed by filtration. The flask and filter cake were washed with EtOAc (˜300 mL). The combined filtrates were filtered again to remove a small amount of residual black solid, then concentrated to give (±)-4-{[(1R*,2R*)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]amino}-2-(methylsulfanyl)-pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (Intermediate 1, 5.84 g, 85%) as an off-white solid.
