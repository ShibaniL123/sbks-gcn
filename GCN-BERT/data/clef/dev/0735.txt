Synthesis of (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one Hydrochloride
A solution of hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether (2.0 N, 0.309 mL, 0.618 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one (0.0790 g, 0.238 mmol) in diethyl ether (3.0 mL) at 0Â° C. The reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour and then stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The white solid precipitated was filtered and collected, washed with diethyl ether and dried at room temperature to obtain (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one hydrochloride (0.0349 g, 0.0861 mmol, 36%)(hereinafter referred to as the compound of Example 20) as a white solid.
