A solution of Compound T1A (a side product from preparation of Compound T1, 1.47 g, 2.0 mmol) was treated with 3-fluorophenol (270 mg, 2.4 mmol) and K2CO3 (560 mg, 4 mmol), and the mixture was heated under nitrogen at 110Â° C. for 9 h. Work-up with ice cold water and extraction with DCM afforded a crude product that was purified by column chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate (6:1) to give pure Compound T2, 3-(3-fluorophenoxy)-2,2-bis((3-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)methyl)propyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate, (0.78 g, 58% yield) as colorless oil.
