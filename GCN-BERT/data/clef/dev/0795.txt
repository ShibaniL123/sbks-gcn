Step 2: Preparation of (S)-7-amino-5-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one
52 mg of (S)-7-amino-5-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one was prepared as a white solid by using 65 mg (0.10 mmol) of (S)-5-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-7-(methylthio)-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one prepared in step 1 according to the same manner as described in step 4 of Example 15 (0.09 mmol, yield: 73%).
