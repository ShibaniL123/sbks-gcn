Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-7-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Sodium nitrite (133 mg, 1.93 mmol) was added in water (0.5 mL) to a cooled solution of (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-3, 5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (771 mg, 1.75 mmol) in propionic acid (5833 μL)/water (1167 μL) at −15° C. The reaction was stirred for 30 minutes, then EtOAc (50 mL), which had been cooled in dry-ice was added. The reaction was quenched by addition of 2N Na2CO3 until bubbling ceased, then the layers were separated. The aqueous was extracted with EtOAc, then the organic was dried and evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 50% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-7-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (460 mg, 58%) as a pale yellow solid.
