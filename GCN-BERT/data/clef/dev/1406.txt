Preparation of (R)-2-methyl-3-(2-((2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)amino)propyl)aniline
2,2,2-Trifluoroethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (1.3 g, 2.8 mmol) was added to a stirred to solution of (R)-3-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methylaniline (0.460 g, 2.80 mmol; prepared according to Example 3) and diisopropylethylamine (0.636 mL, 3.64 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (10 mL). The reaction was heated at 65Â° C. for 15 hours and then cooled and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in EtOAc (50 mL) and washed with a mixture of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (20 mL), and the combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in MeOH, adsorbed onto diatomaceous earth under reduced pressure, and purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 1 to 6% MeOH in DCM. Product fractions were concentrated to dryness to afford (R)-2-methyl-3-(2-((2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)amino)propyl)aniline (0.30 g, 44%) as a pale orange gum.
