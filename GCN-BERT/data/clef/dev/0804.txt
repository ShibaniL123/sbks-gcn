Synthesis Example 5
To an acetonitrile solution (50 mL) containing compound 2 (100 mg, 0.4 mmol) were added iodine (113 mg, 0.44 mmol) and iodobenzene diacetate (143 mg, 0.44 mmol). Next, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction solution was diluted with a sodium thiosulfate aqueous solution and was then extracted using ethyl acetate to recover an organic layer. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated saline and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure, the remainder was purified by flash column chromatography (using an eluent ratio of hexane : ethyl acetate = 10 : 1) to give compound 5 as a red solid (167 mg,84%).
