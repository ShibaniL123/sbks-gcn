A mixture of pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (7.75 g, 20.0 mmol), ethyl 3-hydroxybenzoate (10.80 g, 65 mmol), potassium carbonate (13.80 g, 100 mmol) and DMF (50 mL) was stirred under argon and heated at 110Â° C. for 20 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into ice/water (200 mL) and extracted with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, 400 mL). The extract was washed with water (200 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using silica gel and hexane/ethyl acetate (9:1) as an eluent to give pure Compound B1, diethyl 3,3'-((2-(bromomethyl)-2-((3-(ethoxycarbonyl)phenoxy)methyl)propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy))dibenzoate, (5.22 g, 40% yield).
