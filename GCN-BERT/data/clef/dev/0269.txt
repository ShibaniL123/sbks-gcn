Representative Synthetic Example 2
Step 2-1: 3-(5-Amino-2-methylphenyl)-7-chloro-1-methyl-3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d] pyrimidin-2(1H)-one
7-Chloro-1-methyl-3-(2-methyl-5-nitrophenyl)-3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one (1.4 g, 4.2 mmol) and ammonium chloride (4.5 g, 84 mmol) were added to a mixed solution of THF/methanol/water (4:2:1, 17.5 mL), then iron powder (2.3 g, 42 mmol) was added, and stirred at 80Â° C. for 2 hours. When the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered using a celite pad. The filtrate was extracted with dichloromethane and water. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated to obtain the desired compound (1.1 g, 87.3%) as a pale yellow solid.
