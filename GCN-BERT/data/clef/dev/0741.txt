(2) Preparation of (2S,5R)-2-((2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carboxamido)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate
(2S,5R)-2-((2-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carboxamido)-7-oxo-1,6-dia zabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-ylsulfuric acid tetra(n-butyl)ammonium salt (3.4 g, 4.85 mmol) was added in dichloromethane (16 mL), cooled to 0°C, trifluoroacetic acid (8 mL) was added. Reaction was performed at 0°C for 0.5 h, LC-MS was used to detect the end of reaction. Solvent was removed by vacuum distillation, and acetonitrile (150 mL) was added under ultrasonic to get a large amount of with precipitate. After suck filtration, the filter cake was washed with acetonitrile (20 mL×3), dried in vacuum to obtain the title compound (1.52 g, 86.9 %).
