Step 5. tert-Butyl 5-(4-amino-2-(difluoromethoxy)-6-fluorophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate
tert-Butyl 5-chloro-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate (330 mg, 0.989 mmol, Intermediate 1), 3-(difluoromethoxy)-5-fluoro-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)aniline (360 mg, 1.186 mmol), chloro(2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)[2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) (Pd XPhos G2) (75 mg, 0.096 mmol) and potassium phosphate (406 mg, 1.91 mmol) were placed in a flask and the flask was evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Then dioxane (20 mL) and degassed water (2 mL) were added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 90° C. for 2 h. After cooling to r.t., the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, and the resulting mixture was washed with brine. The separated organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated in vacuo and the obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (291 mg, 62%).
