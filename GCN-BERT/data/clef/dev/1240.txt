A mixture of Intermediate 4-hydroxy-3-(4-phenylnaphthalen-1-yl)pent-3-en-2-one, 0.65 g (3.54 mmol) of zinc(II) acetate, and 1.02 g (10.62 mmol) of sodium tert-butoxide was dissolved in 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and then, the reaction mixture was refluxed and stirred for 8 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature. Then, an extraction process was performed thereon three times by using dichloromethane and water. An organic layer obtained therefrom was dried by using magnesium sulfate and filtered by using celite. Then, column chromatography was performed thereon to obtain 1.77 g (2.66 mmol, yield=75%) of Compound 19.
