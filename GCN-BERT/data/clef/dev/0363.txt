(E)-3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7,8-dimethoxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-t etrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7,8-dimethoxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 35c (18 mg, 0.04 mmol) was dissolved in 4 mL of a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol (V/V=1:1), then 0.5 mL of 1M sodium hydroxide solution was added. The reaction was stirred for 10 hours at room temperature. 1M hydrochloric acid was added dropwise to adjust the pH to 6. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL). The organic phase was washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7,8-dimethoxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid 35 (5 mg, yield 28%) as a light yellow solid.
