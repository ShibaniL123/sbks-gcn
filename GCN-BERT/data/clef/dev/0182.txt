Step 2
The compound 55 (2.42 g, 12.3 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (24.2 mL). Under ice cooling, NaOMe (28% MeOH solution, 2.37 g, 12.26 mmol) was slowly added to the solution. The mixture was stirred for 5 hours. Under ice cooling, 10% citric acid was added to the reaction mixture to render the reaction mixture acidic. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate-n-hexane) to give the compound 56 (1.41 g, yield 59%).
