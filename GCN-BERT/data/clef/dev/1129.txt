Synthesis of Compound B-30
A solution of N-(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-amine (2.97 g, 7.24 mmol) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (18 mL) was bubbled with nitrogen gas for 30 mins, and then boron tribromide (1M in dichloromethane, 12.5 mL, 12.5 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 180° C. for 2 hours. After cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, diphenylzinc (3.74 g, 17.0 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture inside the glovebox. The reaction mixture was heated to 120° C. for 6 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature (22° C.), water was added, and the reaction mixture was extracted with diethyl ether (×3). The combined organic layer was washed with water and brine solution sequentially, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography with 10-20% dichloromethane in hexane to give Compound B-30 (3.03 g, 84% yield) as a white solid.
