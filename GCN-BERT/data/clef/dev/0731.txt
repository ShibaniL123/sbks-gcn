Step 4: Synthesis of 4-(4-(4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)ethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-N-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanamide
To a solution of 4-(4-(4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)ethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)butanamide (200 mg, 1 eq) in MeOH (6 ml) was added with HCl solution in MeOH (1.25N, 0.83 ml, 3 eq) and stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was diluted with water (6 ml), adjusted the pH to 7.0. The water was concentrated in vacuo and the resulting residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (40 mg, 24%).
