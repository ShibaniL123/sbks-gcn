Under the protection of nitrogen, 4-iodo-1-methylimidazole (651.66 mg 3.13 mmol) and potassium carbonate (1 g, 7.23 mmol) were added to a mixed solution of compound 214D (1 g, 2.41 mmol) in N,N'-dimethylformamide (6 mL) and water (2 mL) under the protection of nitrogen, the reaction solution was displaced with nitrogen three times and reacted in microwaves at 110 Â°C for 30 minutes. The thin layer preparation chromatography showed that compound 214D had reacted completely. The reaction was quenched by addition of water (10 mL) and then extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL * 3). The organic phase was washed with saturated NaCl solution (10 mL * 2), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the residue which was then purified by column chromatography to give compound 214E (pale yellow solid, 300 mg, the yield was 29.03%).
