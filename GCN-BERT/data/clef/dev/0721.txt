Step 7 Synthesis of Compound 177
To Compound 176 (1.77 g, 2.33 mmol) in THF (8.85 mL) solution was added 1 mol/L of TBAF in THF solution (6.96 mL, 6.96 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 60Â°C for 3 hours. After cooling, ethyl acetate and saturated ammonium chloride solution were added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with aqueous saturated ammonium chloride solution and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 177 (1.13 g, 80% yield).
