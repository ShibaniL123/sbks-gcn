A solution of [4-chloro-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidin-5-yl]methanol (CAS#1044145-59-6, 6.6 g, 35 mmol), (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-amino-1-methylcyclopentanol (1b, 4.4 g, 46 mmol) and triethylamine (14.5 mL, 104 mmol) in ACN (86 mL) was stirred in a 50° C. oil bath for 16 h. The reaction solution was evaporated to dryness. Water (25 mL), sat. aq NaCl (25 mL) and sat. aq NaHCO3 (25 mL) were added to the residue, and the mixture extracted with EtOAc (200 mL×3). The combined organics were dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated to dryness. The residue (9.3 g light yellow gum) was suspended in EtOAc (50 mL) with sonication to produce a thick white slurry. This slurry was heated at 60° C. with stirring. Heptane (˜150 mL) was added slowly to the heated suspension, then the mixture allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. The resulting solid was collected by filtration, rinsed with heptane (30 mL), and dried to give (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-{[5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]amino}-1-methylcyclopentanol (1c, 6.91 g, 74%) as a white solid.
