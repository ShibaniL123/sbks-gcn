Example 8. Preparation of Monomer M-3
A 50 mL flask was charged with 2-hydroxy-2-trifluoromethylacetophenone (SM-4, 1.36 g, 6.40 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (16 mL) under nitrogen stream. The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −30° C. n-BuLi (4.0 mL, 6.40 mmol, 1.0 eq. 1.6 M) was added dropwise to the mixture over the course of 10 minutes and the mixture was stirred for 60 minutes at −30° C. This solution was then transferred to an addition flask and added dropwise over the course of 15 minutes to a stirring solution of THF (16 mL) and 2-(2,2-difluoro-2-(fluorosulfonyl)acetamido)ethyl methacrylate (SM-2, 1.85 g, 6.40 mmol, 1.0 eq.) at −30° C. under a nitrogen stream. This reaction mixture was subsequently stirred for 2.5 hours at −30° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (32 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture which was then extracted with Et2O (96 mL) followed by 1N HCl (32 mL). The lower aqueous layer was saved and extracted with an additional portion of Et2O (64 mL). The organic layers were then combined and washed with twice with brine (32 mL portions) and the solution dried over MgSO4. Solvents were removed by an evaporator and the crude material purified by column chromatograph (hexane/CH2Cl2) to give the target PAG monomer as colorless oil (0.32 g, 10.6% yield).
