Step 4: 8-Chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-(difluoromethyl)-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
To a solution of 8-chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-(difluoromethyl)-5-((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (0.025 g, 0.049 mmol) in 0.5 ml of DCM was added 0.5 ml of TFA. The reaction mixture was stirred 1.5 hours. Then it was concentrated. The residue was diluted with ACN and filtered through LP-HCO3 resin to neutralize the TFA salt. The filtrate was concentrated to provide the title compound (0.020 g, 78% yield).
