[Synthesis Example 2] Synthesis of Compound 3
[Reaction Scheme 2-1] Synthesis of [Intermediate 2-a]
In a 500-mL reactor, Intermediate 1-e (20 g, 55 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) were placed and stirred together. After the mixture was cooled to −78° C., 1.6M N-butyllithium (41 mL, 66 mmol) was dropwise added and stirred for 1 hour. Iodine (16.7 g, 66 mmol) was added, followed by heating to room temperature and stirring for 2 hours. An aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution was added and an organic layer was extracted. Purification by column chromatography afforded Intermediate 2-a (20.4 g): yield 91%
