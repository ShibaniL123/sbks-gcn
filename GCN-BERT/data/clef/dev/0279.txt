Preparation of 3-fluoro-2-(4-nitro-1-(1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine 106
A two-neck round bottom flask was charged with 3-fluoro-2-(4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine 104 (20.6 g, 74.6 mM). Anhydrous dioxane (500 ml) was added and the mixture was stirred until it became a clear solution. The reaction flask was degassed and back-filled with nitrogen. Subsequently, NaH (in mineral oil, 60 wt %) (4.47 g, 111.9 mM) was slowly added in portions at room temperature and the greyish suspension was stirred for about 10 minutes. 1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decan-8-yl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate (69.9 g, 224 mM) was added portion wise and reaction mixture was refluxed for two days. After cooling down to room temperature, the reaction was quenched with MeOH (100 ml) and the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. Water (300 ml) was added to the crude product and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2Ã—300 ml). The organic layers were filtered through Na2SO4 and the crude product was adsorbed on silica gel. The desired product 106 (off-white solid, 18.3 g, 59% yield) was isolated by flash chromatography eluting with Hexane/EtOAc (gradient 0 to 30%).
