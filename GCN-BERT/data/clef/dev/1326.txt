Step 4:
N-(5-(1,4-homopiperazin-1-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-5-fluoro-4-(6,7-dihydro-3-isopropyl-2-methyl-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridin-5(4H)-yl)pyrimidine-2-amine
In a nitrogen atmosphere, to a solution of tert-butyl 4-(6-(5-fluoro-4-(6,7-dihydro-3-isopropyl-2-methyl-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridin-5(4H)-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl-amino)pyridin-3-yl)-1, 4-homopiperazine-1-carboxylate (250.00 mg, 441.95 µmol, 1.00 equivalent) in dichloromethane (5.00 mL) was added trifluoroacetic acid (3 mL) at 25°C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 25°C for half an hour. LC/MS showed completion of the reaction and detected the desired product. The reaction solution was concentrated to give a crude product. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC (hydrochloric acid) to give the title compound (127.94 mg, 274.80 µmol, 62.18% yield).
