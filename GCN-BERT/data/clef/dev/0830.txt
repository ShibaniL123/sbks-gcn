Step 1: Synthesis of 4-(4-(4-(5-aminopent-1-yn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)butanamide
To a solution of 5-(4-(1-(3-methyl-3-(methylsulfonyl)-4-oxo-4-(((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)amino)butyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)phenyl)pent-4-yn-1-yl methanesulfonate (Example 19, step 3) (200 mg, 1 eq) in 1,4-dioxane (0.67 ml) was added with ammonia (0.5M in 1,4-dioxane, 6.7 ml, 10 eq). The mixture was refluxed for 12 hr and cooled room temperature, and the solvent was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (80 mg, 46%).
