EXAMPLE 116
N-[(S)-2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-5-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-propyl]acetamide (reaction scheme No. 4, compound 116)
116.1: 2-(5-methoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-propionitrile
A solution containing 1 g (5.2 mmol) of (5-methoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-acetonitrile (prepared as in example 115.1) and 0.6 ml (8.9 mmol) of iodomethane in 5 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide is added at 0Â° C. to a solution containing 208 mg (5.2 mmol) of sodium hydride in 7 ml (91 mmol) of N,N-dimethylformamide. After 1 hour, the mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate and then with water. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with ethyl acetate, the organic phase is washed with water and then brine. After drying over magnesium sulphate, the solution is filtered and then concentrated under vacuum. After purification by silica gel chromatography, 663 mg (62%) of 2-(5-methoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-propionitrile is obtained in the form of a clear oil.
