Intermediate 47: 5,8-Dichloro-2-ethyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
To a solution of 1,2-diamino-3,6-dichloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 13, 397 mg, 0.89 mmol) in AcOH (7 mL) and MeOH (3.5 mL) was added Cu(OAc)2 (80.8 mg, 0.45 mmol) and propionaldehyde (0.19 mL, 2.67 mmol). The mixture was heated to 70° C. for 6 h. Additional Cu(OAc)2 (162 mg, 0.89 mmol) was added, and the mixture heated to 80° C. for 6 h. After cooling to rt, the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue suspended in EtOAc. The suspension was washed with saturated aq. NH4Cl, and the aqueous layer extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (90 mg, 36%).
