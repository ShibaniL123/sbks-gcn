(E)-1-(2-nitrovinyl)-1-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopropane
To a solution of 2-nitro-1-(1-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopropyl)ethanol (21.0 g, 106.4 mmol)) in dichloromethane (200 mL) at −10° C. under an inert atmosphere was added trifluoroacetic anhydride (16.52 mL, 117.2 mmol). The mixture was stirred at −15° C. for 5 minutes and then triethylamine (32.61 mL, 234.08 mmol) was added while keeping the bath temperature at −15° C. during the addition. The stirring was continued at −10° C. for 45 minutes. The reaction was monitored by TLC (stained with iodine and UV) and quenched with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (150 mL). The mixture was diluted with dichloromethane (150 mL) and stirred for 5 minutes. The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL×2). The combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluted with 1/300 ethyl acetate/petroleum ether) to give the title compound (E)-1-(2-nitrovinyl)-1-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopropane (11.2 g, 61.88 mmol, 58.1% yield).
