Example 6 Preparation of N2-(8-(azetidin-3-yl)-7-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-5-c hloro-N4-(2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)pyrimidine-2,4-diamine (Compound 6)
(1) Preparation of tert-butyl 3-((methylsulfonyl)oxy)azetidin-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 3-hydroxyazetidin-1-carboxylate (2.0 g, 11.5 mmol) was dissolved in 50mL tetrahydrofuran, and triethylamine (2.34 g, 23.1 mmol) was added. Under the condition of ice water bath, methanesulfonyl chloride (1.58 g, 13.8 mmol) was added slowly. The resultant mixture was warmed to room temperature, and further reacted for 4 h. After the reaction, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and to the residue,50mL waterwas added. After extraction with ethyl acetate (3Ã—50mL), the organic phases were combined, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, and filtrated. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to obtain the product (2.67 g, yield: 92%).
