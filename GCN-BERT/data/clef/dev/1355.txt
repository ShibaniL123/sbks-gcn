Intermediate 20: 2-Isopropylpyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine
To a suspension of 3-nitropyridine-2-carbaldehyde (200 mg, 1.3 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (8.0 mL) were added isopropylamine (140 μL, 1.6 mmol) and 4 Å molecular sieves (400 mg). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to 10° C. and sodium cyanoborohydride (110 mg, 1.8 mmol) and acetic acid (120 μL, 2.1 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 10° C. for 30 min and then at rt for 20 h, followed by heating at 100° C. for 24 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, filtered through a pad of Celite and evaporated. The residue was purified by FCC (SiO2; 50% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the title compound as a dark yellow oil (46 mg, 22% yield).
