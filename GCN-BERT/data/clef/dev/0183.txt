Step 2: Preparation of (4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)phenyl)(morpholino)methanone
(4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)phenyl)(morpholino)methanone was obtained (371 mg, yield 90%) by the same method as described in Step 3 of Example 1 using the (4-bromophenyl)(morpholino)methanone (455 mg, 1.68 mmol) obtained in Step 1 and propargyl alcohol (0.196 ml, 3.36 mmol).
