5-bromo-3-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-2-methoxypyridine
(5-Bromo-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methanol (1.876 g, 8.60 mmol), tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (1.556 g, 10.32 mmol), and imidazole (0.879 g, 12.91 mmol) were stirred in dichloromethane (35 mL) overnight at room temperature. Methanol (3 mL) was added to quench the tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes. The mixture was diluted with dichloromethane and washed twice with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and once with brine. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to afford 5-bromo-3-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-2-methoxypyridine (2.71 g, 8.16 mmol, 95% yield).
