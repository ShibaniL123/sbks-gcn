Synthesis of compound 2-c
At 0°C, triethyl phosphonoacetate (1.4mL, 5mmol) and sodium hydride (240mg, 6mmol) were added into a solution of compound 2-d (470mg, 2mmol) in THF (lOmL), the mixture was further stirred for 1h. The mixture was warmed to room temperature, followed by adding saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl (300mL), extracted with EA (50mL×3). The organic phases were combined, washed in turn with water (10mL×3) and saturated brine (10mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified with silica column chromatography (PE:EA = 5:1) to give light yellow solid 2-c (380mg, yield 62%).
