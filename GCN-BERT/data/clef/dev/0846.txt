EXAMPLE 42
3-methyl-5-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 42)
42.1: 1-benzhydryl-3-methyl-5-(6-methyl-1-oxy-pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione
15 mg (0.1 mmol) of palladium(II) acetate and 20 mg (0.1 mmol) of tri-tert-butylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate are added to a solution of 500 mg (1.4 mmol) of 1-benzhydryl-5-bromo-3-methyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (prepared as described in example 2.2), 294 mg (2.7 mmol) of 2-picoline-N-oxide, and 279 mg (2 mmol) of potassium carbonate in 10 ml of toluene, previously degassed with nitrogen for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is heated at 110Â° C. in a sealed tube for 40 hours. It is filtered on Celite and the filtrate is concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue is chromatographed on silica gel eluted with a dichloromethane/acetone mixture 70/30. 220 mg (41%) of 1-benzhydryl-3-methyl-5-(6-methyl-1-oxy-pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of an off-white solid.
