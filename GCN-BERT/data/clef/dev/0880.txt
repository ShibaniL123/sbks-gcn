Method B: A microwave vial was charged with 6-iodo-8-methyl-2-propyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (Intermediate 66, 269 mg, 0.89 mmol), methyl 2,2-difluoro-2-(fluorosulfonyl)acetate (0.28 mL, 2.23 mmol), CuI (425 mg, 2.23 mmol), DMPU (0.61 mL, 5.06 mmol), and DMF (5.6 mL). The vial was evacuated under vacuum and backfilled with Na (×3), and then capped and sealed. The reaction was then stirred in a microwave reactor at 130° C. for 45 min. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered over a pad of Celite®, eluting with MeOH. After concentrating the filtrate in vacuo, the residue was dissolved in EtOAc and washed with sat. aq. NH4Cl. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (×2), and the combined organics washed with brine (×3), dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound (137 mg, 63%).
