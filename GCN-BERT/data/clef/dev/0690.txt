Example 12. Preparation of PAG-3
A 50 mL flask was charged with 2-hydroxy-2-trifluoromethylacetophenone (SM-9, 0.98 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (12 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −30° C. nBuLi (1.6 M, 1.5 mL, 2.40 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added drop-wise to the mixture over 10 minutes and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at −20° C. This solution was then added to a cold (−20° C.) solution of methyl 2,2-difluoro-2-(fluorosulfonyl)acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.92 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in THF (12 mL) over 5 minutes and the mixture was stirred for 2.5 hours while warming from −20° C. to 20° C. 1N HCl (24 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then Et2O (72 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (24 mL), the lower layer was extracted with Et2O (48 mL), and the organic layers were combined. This solution was washed with brine (24 mL) twice and was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and the crude product was purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt) to obtain the target PAG as a colorless oil (0.02 g, 1.3% yield).
