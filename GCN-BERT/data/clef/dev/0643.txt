Step 2. 6-Bromo-1-trityl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine 4-oxide
To a solution of 6-bromo-1-trityl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine (3.240 g, 7.36 mmol) in DCM (60.0 ml) was added m-CPBA (5.83 g, 26.0 mmol) portionwise. After stirring at room temperature for 16 h, the reaction mixture was treated with a solution of sodium thiosulfate (30.0 g, 190 mmol) in water (100 ml). The organic phase was washed with 2 M K2CO3 (aq), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (120 g, 0-100% EtOAc in DCM) to give the desired product as a white foamy solid (3.22 g, 96%).
