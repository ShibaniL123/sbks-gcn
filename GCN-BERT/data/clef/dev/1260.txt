Step 3: Preparation of (S)-7-amino-5-(2-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(m-tolyl)-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)pyrrolidine-1-yl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one
31 mg of (S)-7-amino-5-(2-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(m-tolyl)-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)pyrrolidine-1-yl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one was prepared as a white solid according to the same manner as described in step 8 of Example 1 except that (S)-7-amino-5-(2-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(m-tolyl)-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)pyrrolidine-1-yl)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one was used (0.06 mmol, yield: 67%).
