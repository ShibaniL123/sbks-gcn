190.7: 5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid
100 mg (0.3 mmol) of [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl acetate is dissolved in 5 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 0.5 mL of water and then 0.5 mL of a 1M aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide monohydrate is added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1.5 h, hydrolysed and then diluted with ethyl acetate. This first ethyl acetate phase is discarded. The aqueous phase is acidified to pH=5-6 with an aqueous solution of acetic acid of concentration C=1M. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are combined, washed once with water and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. 80 mg (84%) of [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid is obtained in the form of a white solid.
