Step 3: Preparation of N-(7-(1-(3-(cyanomethyl)-1-(methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl) -1H-pyrazole-4-yl)benzo[d]thiazole-2-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide
To a solution of N-(7-(1-(3-(cyanomethyl)azetidin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-yl) benzo[d] thiazole-2-yl) cyclopropanecarboxamide(60 mg, 158.54 umol) and triethylamine(50 mg, 494.6 umol) in dichloromethane(5 mL) was added dropwise methylsulfonyl chloride(50 mg, 436.5 umol). The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 0.5 hour and stirred continuously at 25°C for 1 hour. Both LC-MS and TLC detected and showed that the reaction was completed. The reaction mixture was quenched with water(50 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate(15 mL×3). The organic phase was combined, washed with saturated salt water(5 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered and spun dry. The residue was separated and purified through preparative TLC(PE:EA=1:1) to give N-(7-(1-(3-(cyanomethyl)-1-(methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl) -1H-pyrazole-4-yl)benzo[d]thiazole-2-yl) cyclopropanecarboxamide(45 mg, 62% yield) as a white solid.
