Step B: 3-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)-1-(pyrazin-2-yl)-1H-[thieno[2,3-c]pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid
Ethyl 3-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-(pyrazin-2-yl)-1H-thieno[2,3-c]pyrazole-5-carboxylate (54.0 mg, 0.140 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (900 µl) and methanol (600 µl) at 25 °C. 1M sodium hydroxide (559 µl, 0.559 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture heated to 50 °C, and stirred for 12 h. The reaction was stopped, cooled to room temperature, quenched by addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid (46.2 µL), and concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound with 4 equivalents of sodium chloride (87.2 mg, 0.139 mmol, 99 % yield) was recovered as a light yellow/white solid. LC-MS [M+1] = 359.2.
