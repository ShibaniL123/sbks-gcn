Preparation of MTC-BnCl (MW 298.7)
A flask was charged with MTC-C6F5 (10 g, 30.6 mmol), p-chloromethyl benzyl alcohol (4.8 g, 30.6 mmol), PROTON SPONGE (2 g, 9.3 mmol) and THF (30 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 hours then added directly to a silica gel column. The product was isolated using diethyl ether as the eluent to yield 7.45 g (81%) white crystalline powder.
