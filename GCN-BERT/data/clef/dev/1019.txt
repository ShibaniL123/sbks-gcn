Step 1. (5-Bromo-6-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methanol
To a suspension of methyl 5-bromo-6-methoxypicolinate (20 mg, 0.079 mmol) (Ark Pharm, AK100459) in ethanol (0.25 mL) was added sodium borohydride (9.6 mg, 0.25 mmol). The reaction mixture was then heated at 50° C. for 2.5 h. An additional portion of sodium borohydride (10 mg, 0.27 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was heated at 50° C. for an additional 2 h. The reaction was quenched with water, and the reaction mixture was partitioned between sat. NaHCO3 and EtOAc. The organic layer was removed, and the aqueous mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2×). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (15-55% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the desired product as a white solid (11 mg, 64%). LCMS for C7H9BrNO2 (M+H)+: calculated m/z=218.0, 220.0; found 217.9, 220.1.
