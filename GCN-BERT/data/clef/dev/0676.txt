The first step The synthesis of Compound 90
To a solution of Compound 30 (400mg, 0.907mmol) in DMF (8.00 mL) were added cyanogen bromide (152 mg, 1.36 mmol) and potassium carbonate (188 mg, 1.36 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. Cyanogen bromide (48.0mg, 0.454mmol) and potassium carbonate (62.7mg, 0.454mmol) was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of ice water. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield compound 90 (346mg, yield 82%).
