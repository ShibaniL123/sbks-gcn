184.9: 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-methylsulphanyl-ethyl)-1-{2-[4-(7-methylsulphanyl-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione
185 mg (1 mmol) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and 107 mg (1 mmol) of 1-oxy-pyridin-2-ol are added to 0.3 g (0.8 mmol) of [5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-methylsulphanyl-ethyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid in 2 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction mixture is stirred for 5 min and then 281 mg (1 mmol) of 7-methylsulphanyl-3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one (prepared as described in 184.4) and 0.15 mL (1 mmol) of triethylamine are added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hours and then diluted with dichloromethane and water. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with dichloromethane, the organic phases are combined and washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and then with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride. After drying over magnesium sulphate, the solution is filtered and then concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue obtained is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a heptane/ethyl acetate mixture 7/3. 520 mg (100%) of 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-methylsulphanyl-ethyl)-1-{2-[4-(7-methylsulphanyl-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid.
