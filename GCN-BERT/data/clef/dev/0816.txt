2-(((tert-Butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-5,8-dichloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (Intermediate 7)
Step 1: 2,4,5-Trichloronicotinaldehyde
To a solution of 2,4,5-trichloropyridine (5 g, 27.4 mmol) in 150 ml of THF was added LDA (2 M in heptane, 20.56 ml, 41.1 mmol) at −78° C. The mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 1 hour. Then methyl formate (8.23 g, 137 mmol) in THF (20 mL) was added quickly into the reaction mixture followed by stirring at −78° C. for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was quenched with aqueous saturated NH4Cl solution and extracted with EtOAc three times. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and, volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified with silica-gel chromatography (10-100% EtOAc in heptane) to afford the desired compound as a solid (4.2 g, 73%).
