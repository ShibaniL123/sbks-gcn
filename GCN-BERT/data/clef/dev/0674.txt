Methyl 3-cyano-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoate (IV-25): To a suspension of IV-24 (272 mg, 1.24 mmol) in conc. HCl (770 μL) cooled to 0° C. with stirring was added dropwise a solution of sodium nitrite (86 mg, 1.24 mmol) in water (700 μL) at such a rate to maintain a temperature below 5° C. After addition the reaction was stirred for 40 min then neutralized to pH 6 by the addition of Na2CO3 while still maintaining a temperature below 5° C. In a separate flask, a solution of potassium cyanide (372 mg, 5.70 mmol) in water (2 mL) was added portionwise to a stirred biphasic solution of copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (372 mg, 1.49 mmol) in water (2 mL) and toluene (2 mL) at 0° C. then heated to 70° C. To this was added the diazonium salt solution dropwise while maintaining its temp at 0° C. After addition, the reaction was stirred at 70° C. for 1 h, cooled to room temp, and then separated between EtOAc (30 mL) and water (30 mL). The organic layer was washed with brine (10 mL), dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated to afford a crude dark brown oil that was purified by chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexanes, 1:9) to yield the desired product as a yellow oil (153 mg, 54%).
