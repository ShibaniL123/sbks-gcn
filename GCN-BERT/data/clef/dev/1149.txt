Step 2: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl 2-amino-7-oxo-6.7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3b)
To a solution of tert-butyl 4-bromo-3,5-dioxo-piperidine-1-carboxylate (3a) (0.500 g, 1.71 mmol) in anhydrous MeOH (8 mL) under inert atmosphere was added thiourea (0.226 g, 3.42 mmol). After stirring 30 min at rt, TEA (0.477 mL, 3.42 mmol) was added and the mixture was refluxed 5 h. MeOH was evaporated and the residue was solubilized with EtOAc. The solution was washed with water, 10% of Na2CO3 aqueous solution and brine solution. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated. The solid was triturated with cyclohexane and filtered to give tert-butyl 2-amino-7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3b) (0.350 g, 1.30 mmol, 76%) as an off white solid. MS m/z ([M+H]+) 270.
