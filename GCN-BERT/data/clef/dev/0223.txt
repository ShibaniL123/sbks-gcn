Example 72A
Methyl 4-{[(6-bromo-2-phenyl-3-propylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
150 mg (0.40 mmol) of the compound from Example 38A were dissolved in 1.4 ml (19.8 mmol) of thionyl chloride. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 2.5 h and then at 60Â° C. overnight. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue, after drying under reduced pressure, was taken up in 1 ml of THF. The suspension present was added slowly to a mixture of 0.27 ml (1.54 mmol) of DIPEA and 102 mg (0.46 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride in 1.4 ml of THF, and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT overnight. After addition of ethyl acetate and water, the phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated and the residue was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 98 mg (47% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
