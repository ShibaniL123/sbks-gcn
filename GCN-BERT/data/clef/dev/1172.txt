Step 1. 4-((3-Bromo-4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)-2-methylbutan-2-ol
Methylmagnesium bromide (40 μL, 0.1 mmol, 3 M in Et2O) was added dropwise to a solution of 4-((3-bromo-4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)butan-2-one (12 mg, 0.039 mmol) in THF (1.0 mL) at −78° C. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight during which it came to rt. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0° C., and the reaction was quenched with NH4Cl and water. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3×). The organic layers were filtered through a plug of Na2SO4, combined, and concentrated to afford the title compound (8.2 mg, 65%).
