Step 4
The compound I-1251 (650 mg, 1.44 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (6.5 mL). Triethylamine (0.30 mL, 2.17 mmol) and ethyl chloroformate (0.206 mL, 2.17 mmol) were added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. Insoluble materials were filtered off. Under ice cooling, the filtrate was added to the aqueous solution of sodium borohydride (mixture of sodium borohydride (82 mg, 2.17 mmol) and water (6.5 mL)). The mixture was stirred for 1 hour. Water was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate-n-hexane) to give the compound I-1256 (332 mg, yield 52%).
