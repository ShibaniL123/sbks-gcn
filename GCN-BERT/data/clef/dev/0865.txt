Step 2: Preparation of (S)-7-amino-5-(2-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(pyridine-3-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)pyrrolidine-1-yl)pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one
20 mg of (S)-7-amino-5-(2-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(pyridine-3-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)pyrrolidine-1-yl)pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one was prepared as a white solid according to the same manner as described in step 4 of Example 15 except that (S)-5-(2-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(pyridine-3-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)pyrrolidine-1-yl)-7-(methylthio)pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one was used (0.043 mmol, yield: 86%).
