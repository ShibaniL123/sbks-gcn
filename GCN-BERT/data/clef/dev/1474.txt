Step 2: preparation of intermediate tert butyl N-[(1R)-1-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-2-[methoxy(methyl)amino]-2-oxo-ethyl]carbamate (5b)
To a solution of tert-butyl N-[(1R)-1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-[methoxy(methyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl]carbamate (5a) (5.42 g, 21.8 mmol), imidazole (4.46 g, 65.5 mmol) and DMAP (133 mg, 1.1 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (17 mL) at rt was portionwise added tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (3.95 g, 26.2 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 2 h then poured in H2O (50 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2 x 40 mL). The organic layer was washed with 1 M HCl (50 mL), brine (40 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc 100/0 to 50/50) to provide tert-butyl N-[(1R)-1-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-2-[methoxy(methyl)amino]-2-oxo-ethyl]carbamate (5b) (7.09 g, 19.5 mmol, 89%) as a colorless oil.
