Step 5
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-7-fluoro-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
2-fluoro-5-(2-((2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)amino)propyl)phenol 16e (300 mg, 1.233 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol, then (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-formylphenyl) acrylate 1e (418 mg, 1.896 mmol) and acetic acid (740 mg, 12.33 mmol) were added. The resulting mixture was heated to 80Â°C and stirred for 48 hours. After the reaction was stopped, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature. A solution of 1M sodium bicarbonate was added to the reaction solution to adjust the pH to 7-8. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-7-fluoro-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3-me thyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 16f (300 mg, yield 54%) as a yellow oil.
