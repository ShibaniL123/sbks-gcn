Step-2: Synthesis of 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzoyl chloride
To a two neck RBF (1 liter) placed in ice bath, 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzoic acid (50 g, 0.248 mol, 1 eq.) was charged. Thionyl chloride (110 mL, 1.51 mol, 6.1 eq.) was added dropwise at 0° C. The reaction mixture was allowed to come to RT and then heated to reflux. The reflux was continued overnight. Thionyl chloride was evaporated and ice (approx. 150 g) was added into the reaction mixture. The aqueous reaction mass was extracted with DCM (2×200 mL). The DCM extracts were combined dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to get 50 g (91.7%) of 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzoyl chloride as a light yellow liquid.
