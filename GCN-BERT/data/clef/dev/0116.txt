Step B: 5-Bromo-7-methoxyindolin-2-one. To a solution of 5-bromo-7-methoxyindoline-2,3-dione (670 mg, 2.6 mmol) in n-butanol (8 mL) was added hydrazine hydrate (153 μL, 3.1 mmol). The mixture was heated at 80° C. for 3 h. The temperature was maintained at 80° C. and triethylamine (548 μL, 3.9 mmol) was added. The temperature was then increased to 100° C. and the reaction was stirred at reflux for 24 h. The reaction was cooled to rt and the mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was suspended in hexanes and the resulting mixture was filtered. The solids were washed with hexanes to afford the title compound (297 mg, 46%).
