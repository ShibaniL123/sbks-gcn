Preparation of (E)-3-chloro-5-(4-methoxystyryl) benzaldehyde (C68)
To a stirred solution of 3-bromo-5-chlorobenzaldehyde (20.0 g, 91.32 mmol) in dimethylacetamide, 1-methoxy-4-vinylbenzene (18.3 g, 136.9 mmol) and triethylamine (50 mL, 273.96 mmol) were added, and the reaction mixture was degassed with argon for 5 minutes. Palladium(II) acetate (410 mg, 1.83 mmol) and tri-o-tolylphosphine (1.11 g, 3.65 mmol) were added, and the resulting reaction mixture was heated to 100Â° C. for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude material was purified by flash column chromatography using 5-10% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether as the eluent to afford the title compound as a yellow solid (13.5 g, 54%);
