(2-methoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-3-yl)methanol
Ethyl 2-methoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)nicotinate (59.54 g, 253 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (506 mL). After cooling to 5° C., a solution of lithium aluminum hydride (177 mL, 177 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran was added over 40 minutes, maintaining an internal temperature 10° C. After 1 hour, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 mL of acetone, diluted with methyl tert-butyl ether (300 mL) and stirred with 300 mL of saturated aqueous potassium sodium tartrate (Rochelle's salt) until two clear layers were present. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the combined extracts were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to provide a residue, which was purified by flash chromatography (0 to 30% ethyl acetate in heptane) to provide (2-methoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-3-yl)methanol (40.28 g, 194 mmol, 77% yield).
