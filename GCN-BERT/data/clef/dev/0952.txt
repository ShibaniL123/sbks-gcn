EXAMPLE 4
Synthesis of [4-Iso-Pentoxycarbonyl-9-Fluorenylidene]Malononitrile (VIII)
A mixture of 9-fluorenone-4-carboxylic acid (1.0 g, 4.46 mmol), isopentyl alcohol (7.863 g, 89.2 mmol), conc. sulfuric acid (0.05 mL) and toluene (20 mL) in a 100-mL round-bottomed flask fitted with a Dean-stark apparatus and a water condenser was magnetically stirred and refluxed for 24 h before cooling to room temperature. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure in the presence of NaHCO3 (0.1 g). Subsequently, methylene chloride (100 mL) was added and the resulting solution was washed with dilute aq. NaHCO3 solution (2 times) and with water (2 times), and dried with anhydrous MgSO4. This was followed by filtration and evaporation under reduced pressure to give the crude product which was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel with hexane/ethyl acetate (volume ratio 15/1) as the eluent to afford iso-pentyl 9-fluorenone-4-carboxylate as a yellow oil (1.27 g, 97%).
