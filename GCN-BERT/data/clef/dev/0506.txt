Example 15: Synthesis of (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine.monosulfate
Toluene solution (33.99 g) containing (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine (4.05 g: 32.1 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and 95% sulfuric acid (3.32 g: 32.2 mmol) was added thereto while stirring on ice. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60째 C., to obtain (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine.monosulfate (6.12 g (27.3 mmol, yield=85%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 86째 C., 188째 C., 297째 C.
