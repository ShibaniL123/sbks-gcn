Synthesis of compound 1-b
Compound 1-c (1.88g, 10mmol) and N-bromosuccinimide (2.7g, 15mmol) were dissolved in acetic acid (40mL), the mixture was cooled to room temperature after reacting at 80Â°C for 24hrs. Part of acetic acid was removed under reduced pressure, the residue was filtered through celite, the filtrate cake was washed with DCM (200mL). The filtrate was in turn washed with saturated sodium sulfite solution (200mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified with silica column chromatography (PE:EA = 50:1) to give colorless solid 1-b (2.5g, yield 94%).
