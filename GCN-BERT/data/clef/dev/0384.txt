Example 48A
Methyl 4-({[6-bromo-2-(2-fluorophenyl)-3-methylquinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
At RT, 15 mg (0.07 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, 32 mg (0.08 mmol) of HATU and 0.04 ml (0.22 mmol) of DIPEA were added to a solution of 20 mg (0.06 mmol) of the compound from Example 6A in 0.6 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, water and ethyl acetate were added to the mixture and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were washed with saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution and dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvents were removed on a rotary evaporator. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, mobile phase cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 2:1). This gave 19 mg (64% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
