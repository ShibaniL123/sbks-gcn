The third step
To a mixed solution of Compound 7 (600mg, 1.37mmol) in ethanol (10.0 mL) and water (2.00 mL) were added ammonium chloride (1.09 g, 20.5 mmol) and iron powder (572mg, 10. 3 mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 90 minutes at 90 Â°C. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and filtered through celite. The filtrate was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of ice water, a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 8 (420mg, yield 75.1%).
