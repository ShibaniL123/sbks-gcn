Step 2. 2-(4-Bromo-3,5-difluorophenyl)acetonitrile
To a mixture of 4-(4-bromo-3,5-difluorophenyl)isoxazole (489.4 mg, 1.882 mmol) and potassium fluoride (584.8 mg, 10.07 mmol) was added DMF (5.0 ml) followed by water (5.0 ml). The reaction was heated to 90Â° C. for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2, and washed with brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (40 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as an off-white solid (363.4 mg, 83%).
