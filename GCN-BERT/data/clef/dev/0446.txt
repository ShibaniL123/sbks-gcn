Step 2. methyl 4-((3-(4-aminoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-4-methylphenyl)sulfonamido)cubane-1-carboxylate
To a solution of methyl-4-aminocubane-1-carboxylate (96 mg, 0.54 mmol), Et3N (0.30 mL, 2.2 mmol), and DMAP (6.6 mg, 0.054 mmol) in DCM (0.5 mL) was added 3-(4-aminoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (175 mg, 0.541 mmol) and the resulting solution was stirred at ambient temperature for 6 h. The crude reaction mixture was purified by CombiFlash chromatography (25 g silica gel column, eluting with 0-15% methanol/dichloromethane) to afford the desired product (93 mg, 38%). LCMS for C22H20N6O4S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=465.5; found 465.2.
