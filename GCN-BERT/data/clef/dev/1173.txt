To a mixed solution of Compound 54 (103mg, 0.154mmol) in methanol (1mL) -THF (1mL) was added 2mol / L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (0.500mL, 1.00mmol) under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 55 (78.4mg, yield 90%).
