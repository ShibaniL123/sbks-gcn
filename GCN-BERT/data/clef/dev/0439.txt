Step 5. 3-(4-Aminoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-N-((1s,4s)-4-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl-1-d)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide
To a solution of (1s,4s)-4-amino-1-methylcyclohexan-4-d-1-ol hydrochloride (7.1 mg, 0.043 mmol), triethylamine (18 μL, 0.128 mmol), and DMAP (0.5 mg, 4 μmol) in DMA (350 μL) at 0° C. was added 3-(4-aminoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (14 mg, 0.043 mmol) in a single portion. The reaction mixture was allowed to come to rt, stirring for 2 h. The reaction mixture was again cooled to 0° C., and the reaction was quenched with MeOH. Purification via preparative HPLC on a C-18 column (pH 10, 26-38% MeCN/0.1% NH4OH (aq) over 5 min, 60 mL/min) afforded the title compound as a white solid (4.1 mg, 23%). LCMS for C19H24DN6O3S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=418.2; found 418.1.
