EXAMPLE 120
N-[(S)-2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-propyl]-methanesulphonamide (reaction scheme No. 3 or 4, compound 120)
0.3 ml (3.7 mmol) of methanesulphonyl chloride and 0.5 ml (3.7 mmol) of triethylamine are added at 0Â° C. to a solution containing 1.5 g (2.5 mmol) of 3-((S)-2-amino-1-methylethyl)-5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-1-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (prepared as in example 119) in 15 ml of dichloromethane. After 30 minutes, dichloromethane is added and the reaction mixture is hydrolysed with 1N aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid. The aqueous phase is extracted again with dichloromethane. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. After purification by chromatography, taking up in pentane and filtration, 0.8 g (45%) of N-[(S)-2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-propyl]-methanesulphonamide is obtained in the form of a white solid.
