Example 10A
tert-Butyl 1-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3-(2-phenylethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate
1.85 g (5.69 mmol) of caesium carbonate were added to a solution of 2.0 g (5.18 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 6A in 60 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 10 min. 863 mg (6.21 mmol) of 2-bromomethyl methyl ether were then added, and the mixture was heated to 100Â° C. for 30 min. The mixture was then evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was taken up in ethyl acetate and washed successively with water and saturated sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated. The crude product was purified by MPLC (Puriflash column with 80 g of silica gel, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 10:1). Filtration, evaporation and drying of the residue under high vacuum gave 2.22 g (96% of theory) of the title compound
