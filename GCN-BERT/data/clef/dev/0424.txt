Step 3
The compound 40 (181 mg, 0.590 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane (4 mL). 2-Chloro-3-trifluoromethylphenol (151 mg, 0.767 mmol) and cesium carbonate (288 mg, 0.885 mmol) were added to the solution. The mixture was stirred under microwave irradiation at 100Â°C for 4.5 hours. Water was added to the mixture. The mixture was washed by ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to give the compound 41 (132 mg, yield 47.9%).
