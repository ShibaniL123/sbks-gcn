(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-{[(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]amino}-5-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-{[(propan-2-yl)oxy]carbonyl}pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid
Example 86A
(2S,3R,4S,5S)-2-ethyl 1-isopropyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(3-chlorophenyl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate
(2S,3R,4S,5S)-Ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(3-chlorophenyl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Core 29, 2.003 g, 5.64 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (6.64 mL) and triethylamine (1.967 mL, 14.11 mmol) was added, followed by slow addition of isopropyl carbonochloridate (3.39 mL, 6.77 mmol) solution after cooling in an ice-water bath to ˜10° C. The addition was at such a rate that the temperature was maintained at or below ambient temperature during the addition (2-3 minutes). After the addition was complete, the reaction was removed from the water bath and stirred at ambient temperature for 1 hour. Isopropyl chloroformate (0.4 mL) was added, and the reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 30 more minutes. The mixture was diluted with diethyl ether and stirred with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate for 20 minutes before separating the layers, washing the organic layer twice with 1 M aqueous HCl and brine then drying over sodium sulfate, filtering, and concentrating to give a crude residue, which was loaded onto a 40 g silica gel cartridge eluting with a gradient of 5-100% ethyl acetate/heptanes over a period of 40 minutes to provide impure product. The product was precipitated from hexanes to give (2S,3R,4S,5S)-2-ethyl 1-isopropyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(3-chlorophenyl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (2.086 g, 4.73 mmol, 84% yield).
