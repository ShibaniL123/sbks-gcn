Step 4: 2-[bromo(d2)methyl]-5-methylpyrimidine
To a solution of (5-methylpyrimidin-2-yl)(d2)methanol [Example 9, Step 3] (1.5 g, 11.9 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in DCM (20 mL) was added PPh3 (3.12 g, 11.9 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and NBS (2.12 g, 11.9 mmol, 1.00 equiv) at 0° C. The resulting solution was stirred for 1 h at 0° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of H2O (20 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with DCM (3×20 mL). The organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was applied onto a silica gel column with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:2) to afford 700 mg (31.3%) of 2-[bromo(d2)methyl]-5-methylpyrimidine as a yellow oil.
