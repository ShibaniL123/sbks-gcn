Synthesis Example 1-2: Synthesis of [Intermediate 1-b]
In a round-bottom flask, Intermediate 1-a (33.5 g, 110 mmol) was added to tetrahydrofuran (150 ml) and cooled to −10° C. before slow addition of drops of 3 M methyl magnesium bromide (85 ml, 254 mmol) thereto. After the temperature was elevated to 40° C., stirring was performed for 4 hours. Then, the temperature was reduced to −10° C. and drops of 2 N HCl (70 ml) were slowly added. Subsequently, an aqueous ammonium chloride solution (70 ml) was added, followed by elevation to room temperature. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was washed with water, concentrated in a vacuum, and separated by column chromatography to afford [Intermediate 1-b] (27 g): yield 80%
