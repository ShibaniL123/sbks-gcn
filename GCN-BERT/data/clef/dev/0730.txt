Step 5
To a solution of Compound 18i (6.2g, 10.5mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (15mL) was added 1mol / L tetrabutylammonium fluoride tetrahydrofuran solution (27mL, 27.0mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 60Â°C. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 19i (4.2 g, 96%) as a colorless foam compound.
