Example 4
(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetr ahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
1-(benzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-amine
1-(benzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-one 4a (1 g, 5.74 mmol, prepared by a well-known method disclosed in "Khimiya Geterotsiklicheskikh Soedinenii, 1987, (7), 889-93"), ammonium acetate (4.42 g, 57.4 mmol) and sodium acetate (470 mg, 5.74 mmol) were dissolved in 30 mL of methanol. Sodium cyanoborohydride (540 mg, 8.6 mmol) was added, and 10 drops of acetic acid were added dropwise. After the resulting mixture was stirred for 12 hours at 25Â°C, the reaction was stopped. 1 N NaOH solution was added dropwise to adjust the pH to 7-8. The mixture was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound 1-(benzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-amine 4b (600 mg, yield 60%) as a brown liquid.
