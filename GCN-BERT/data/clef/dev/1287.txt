1-(3-formyl-4-methoxy-phenyl)-cyclobutanecarbonitrile
1-(3-[1,3]Dioxolan-2-yl-4-methoxy-phenyl)-cyclobutanecarbonitrile (134 mg, 0.52 mmol, 1.0 eq) was dissolved in acetone (15 mL). A spatula of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) (CAS#104-15-4) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 72 hours. The mixture was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (heptane/dichloromethane 50/50 to 0/100) to give the title compound (51 mg, 46%). LC/MS (ESI+) m/z 216.2 (M+H)+.
