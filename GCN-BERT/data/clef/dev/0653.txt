Example 2. Preparation of SM-2: 1,1-Difluoro-2-oxo-2-(1-adamantylamino) ethanesulfonyl fluoride
A 100 mL flask was charged with C2Cl2 (20 mL) under nitrogen stream at 0° C. and then 2-(fluorosulfonyl)difluoroacetyl fluoride (8.49 g, 47.1 mmol, 1.2 eq.) was added and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at 0° C. A CH2Cl2 (20 mL) solution of 1-adamantylamine (5.94 g, 39.3 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and Pyridine (3.10 g, 39.3 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added drop-wise to the mixture over 15 minutes and subsequently the mixture was stirred for 4 hours at 0° C. to room temperature. CH2Cl2 (40 mL) and 1N HCl (40 mL) were added to the final reaction mixture and then the lower layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (40 mL) and brine (40 mL). The solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtrated and then CH2Cl2 was removed in an evaporator. The target compound as yellow solid (11.77 g) in 96.2% yield was obtained.
