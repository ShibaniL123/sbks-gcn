Step 4: preparation of intermediate N-allyloxy-2-nitro-N-(4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridin-7-yl)benzenesulfonamide (6d)
To a solution of tert-butyl 7-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (6c) (20 g, 40.28 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (37 mL) under inert atmosphere at 0°C was dropwise added TFA (37 mL, 483 mmol). After stirring for 2 h at rt, the reaction mixture was cooled at 0°C and neutralized with ammonium hydroxide solution 28% until pH 8. The mixture was diluted with water and extracted with DCM. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, concentrated in vacuo to give N-allyloxy-2-nitro-N-(4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridin-7-yl)benzenesulfonamide (6d) (14.68 g, 37.02 mmol, 92%) as a yellow solid.
