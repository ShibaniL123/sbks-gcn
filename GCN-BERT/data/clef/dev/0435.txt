Step 6. 5-(2-Fluoro-6-methylphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine-6-carbonitrile
To a solution of 5-(2-fluoro-6-methylphenyl)-1-trityl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine-6-carbonitrile (406.1 mg, 0.821 mmol) in DCM (10.0 ml) was added TFA (5.0 ml). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and then concentrated. The residue was dissolved in DCM and washed with sat. NaHCO3(aq). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (40 g, 0-100% EtOAc in DCM) to give the desired product as a white solid (140.1 mg, 68%).
