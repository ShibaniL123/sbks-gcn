(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-{[(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]amino}-5-[2-(dimethylamino)pyridin-3-yl]-1-{[(propan-2-yl)oxy]carbonyl}pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid
Example 66A
(2S,3R,4S,5S)-2-ethyl 1-isopropyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-(dimethylamino)pyridin-3-yl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate
(2S,3R,4S,5S)-Ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-(dimethylamino)pyridin-3-yl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-2-carboxylate hydrochloride (Core 11, 1 g, 2.494 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (8.3 mL) was treated with triethylamine (1.1 mL, 7.89 mmol) and then isopropyl chloroformate (1 M solution in toluene) (4.6 mL, 4.60 mmol) at room temperature. The reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight. The volatiles were removed in vacuo, and the crude material was purified by silica gel chromatography, eluting with 5 to 80% ethyl acetate-heptanes. The title compound was obtained, 0.548 g (49% yield).
