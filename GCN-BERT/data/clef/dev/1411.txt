2-[4-hexyl-5-(trifluoromethyl-2-thienyl]-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane
A solution of 13.8 g (58.4 mmol, 1.00 eq) 3-hexyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)thiophene was cooled down to −78° C. and 25.7 ml (64.3 mmol, 1.10 eg, 2.50 mol/l) n-BuLi was added dropwise. After 30 min, 13.1 g (70.1 mmol, 1.20 eq) 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane was added and stirring continued for 30 min. The cooling bath was removed and the reaction mixture stirred over night at room temperature. It was quenched with water and extracted three times with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (dichloromethane/n-hexane 1:4). A pale yellow oil was obtained (11.6 g, 55%). MS=362.3-hexyl-5-(3-hexyl-2-thienyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)thiophene.
