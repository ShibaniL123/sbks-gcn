Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-7-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Sodium nitrite (0.049 g, 0.72 mmol) as a solution in water (0.750 mL) was added dropwise to a cooled solution of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (0.30 g, 0.68 mmol) in propionic acid (2.5 mL) at −15° C., and the reaction was stirred for 1 hour under these conditions. Ice-cold EtOAc (10 mL) was added followed by saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (10 mL) in portions. The layers were separated, and the the organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The combined aqueous layers were extracted with EtOAc, and all organic layers were combined, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 20 to 70% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-7-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (0.23 g, 75%) as a gum.
