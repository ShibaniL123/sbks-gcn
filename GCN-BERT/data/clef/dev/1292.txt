Step 1. 6-Chloroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-8-amine
To a solution of 5-chloro-2,3-diaminopyridine (1 g, 7 mmol) in ethanol (50 mL) was slowly added chloroacetaldehyde (3.5 mL, 27 mmol, 50% in H2O). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 h. Heating was discontinued, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated. Et2O was added to the resulting residue, and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The resulting oil was dissolved in water, and the aqueous layer was basified by addition of 1 M NaOH (aq). The aqueous layer was then extracted with DCM (3Ã—). The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (1-10% MeOH in DCM) afforded the title compound as a light brown solid (0.9 g, 80%).
