Example 76
(E)-3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-6-(1-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-met hyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
1-(5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-one
5-bromobenzofuran-3(2H)-one 76a (5 g, 23.471 mmol, prepared by a method disclosed in the patent application "2008068974"), acetonyltriphenylphosphonium chloride (12.5 g, 35.206 mmol), and N,N-diisopropylehtylamine (9.1 g, 70.413 mmol) were dissolved in 60 mL of dimethylbenzene. The mixture was warmed up to 120Â°C and stirred for 12 hours, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound 1-(5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-one 76b (3.1 g, yield 53%) as a yellow oil.
