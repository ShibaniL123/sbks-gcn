Synthesis of 1-(3-fluoro-5-methoxypyridin-4-yl)-8-(1-fluoromethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-1,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one (Compound Example 140)
1-(3-Fluoro-5-methoxy-4-pyridyl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)imidazo[4,5-c]-quinolin-2-one (60 mg, 0.14 mmol, 97%), potassium carbonate (57.6 mg, 0.42 mmol) and N,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml) were initially introduced in a sealed 30 ml reaction vessel. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes and cooled to 0Â° C. Bromofluoro-methane (165 mg, 1.39 mmol, 95%) was added, the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for a further hour. The reaction was then terminated by addition of 50 mL of water. The solution was extracted three times with 30 mL of ethyl acetate each time, the organic phases were combined and evaporated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by means of preparative HPLC, giving 5 mg (8%) of 1-(3-fluoro-5-methoxypyridin-4-yl)-8-(1-fluoromethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-1,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one as white solid.
