Fourth Step: Synthesis of Intermediate 6
15.0 g (26.62 mmol) of Intermediate 4, 7.43 g (31.94 mmol) of Intermediate 5, 9.20 g (66.55 mmol) of potassium carbonate, and 0.92 g (0.8 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) were mixed with 80 mL of 1,4-dioxane and 40 mL of water in a 250 ml flask, and the mixture was heated at 100Â° C. under a nitrogen flow for 24 hours. An organic layer was separated therefrom and volatilized and then, added to 400 ml of methanol, and a solid crystallized therein was filtered, dissolved in monochlorobenzene, filtered with silica gel/Celite, and after removing an appropriate amount of an organic solvent, recrystallized with monochlorobenzene to obtain 11.9 g of Intermediate 6 (a yield of 67%).
