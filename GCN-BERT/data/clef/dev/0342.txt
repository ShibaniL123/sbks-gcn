6-Fluoro-1-(p-toluenesulfonyl)indole-2-carboxylic acid
6-Fluoro-1-(p-toluenesulfonyl) indole (39.80 g, 132.06 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (400 mL) at -70 °C, and n-butyllithium (2.5 mol, 52.82 mL) was added to the mixture and stirred for 1 hour. Dry ice (58.11 g, 1.32 mmol) was slowly added to the mixture and stirred for 1.5 hours. TLC showed the reaction was complete, saturated NH4Cl solution (200 mL) was added to the mixture, extracted with EA (200 mL × 2), the pH of the aqueous phase was adjusted to 1 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and then extracted with DCM (200 mL × 3) and concentrated to deliver the title compound (yellow solid, 32.75 g, yield 74.40%).
