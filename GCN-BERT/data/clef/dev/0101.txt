Step C: 2-Cyclopropyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. A solution of 2-(2-cyclopropylethynyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium-1-amine 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (1.46 g, 3.42 mmol) in AcOH (14 mL) was stirred at 80° C. for 16 h. After cooling to rt, ice water (20 mL) was added and the pH was adjusted to ˜9 by the addition of 2 M NaOH. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2×70 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (1×50 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2; 100% diisopropyl ether) to give the title compound (727 mg, 93%) as a light brown liquid.
