(Synthesis of Second Compound for Organic Optoelectric Device)
Synthesis Example 17: Synthesis of Compound B-130
20.00 g (42.16 mmol) of 3-bromo-6-phenyl-N-metabiphenylcarbazole, 17.12 g (46.38 mmol) of N-phenylcarbazole-3-boronic ester, and 175 mL of tetrahydrofuran and toluene (1:1) and 75 mL of a 2M-potassium carbonate aqueous solution under a nitrogen atmosphere in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, 1.46 g (1.26 mmol) of tetrakistriphenyl phosphine palladium (0) was added thereto, and the mixture was heated and refluxed under a nitrogen flow for 12 hours. When a reaction was complete, the reactant was poured into methanol, and a solid produced therein was filtered and then, sufficiently washed with water and methanol and dried. The obtained resulting material was heated with 700 mL of chlorobenzene and dissolved therein, and the solution was filtered with silica gel, and after completely removing the solvent, a solid obtained therefrom was heated with 400 mL of chlorobenzene and dissolved therein and then, recrystallized to obtain 18.52 g of Compound B-130 (a yield of 69%). calcd. C42H32N2: C, 90.54; H, 5.07; N, 4.40; found: C, 90.54; H, 5.07; N, 4.40.
