Intermediate 68: 5-Chloro-2-(difluoromethyl)-8-methyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Step A: 2-(Difluoromethyl)-6-iodo-8-methyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a suspension of 1,2-diamino-5-iodo-3-methylpyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 12) (500 mg, 1.11 mmol) in MeOH (5.7 mL) at 0° C. was added Et3N (0.46 mL, 3.34 mmol), followed by methyl difluoroacetate (0.15 mL, 1.7 mmol) dropwise via syringe. The reaction was maintained at 45° C. and stirred for 16 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2, 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound (304 mg, 88%).
