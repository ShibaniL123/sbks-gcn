Synthesis of 1-isopropyl-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde
Potassium carbonate (0.863 g, 6.24 mmol) and 2-iodopropane (0.614 mL, 6.24 mmol) were added to a solution of 1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde (0.500 g, 5.20 mmol) in N,N-dimethyl formamide (5.2 mL) at room temperature. The reaction liquid was stirred at 60Â° C. for 4 hours. The reaction liquid was cooled to room temperature. Ethyl acetate and distilled water were added to the reaction liquid and the reaction liquid was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, n-hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain 1-isopropyl-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde (0.355 g, 2.57 mmol, 49%) as a colorless oil.
