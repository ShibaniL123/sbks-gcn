[Reaction Scheme 1-2] Synthesis of [Intermediate 1-b]
In a 1-L reactor, tetrahydrofuran (500 mL) and 1,3-dibromobenzene (50 g, 212 mmol) were placed and cooled to −78° C. under a nitrogen atmosphere. Drops of 1.5M LDA (170 mL, 254 mmol) were slowly added and then stirred for 30 min. At the same temperature, DMF (18.5 g, 254 mmol) was slowly added in a dropwise manner, followed by stirring for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with an aqueous sulfuric acid solution. The organic layer was extracted and concentrated at a reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography afforded Intermediate 1-b (49 g): yield 88%
