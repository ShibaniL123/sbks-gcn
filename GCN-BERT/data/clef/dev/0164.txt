The fifth step
To a solution of Compound 18 (1.3g, 3.65mmol) in methanol (13mL) was added potassium carbonate (1.5g, 11mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 5 hours at 60 Â°C. After the solvent of the reaction mixture was concentrated, 2 mol / L hydrochloric acid was added thereto, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in methanol (6 mL) and toluene (6mL), and 2mol / L trimethylsilyldiazomethane - hexane solution (1.8 mL, 3.7 mL) was added thereto. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (chloroform-methanol) to yield Compound 19 (800g, yield 70%).
