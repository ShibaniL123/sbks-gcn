Example 26
Step 1: Preparation of benzyl 3-oxocyclobutane-carboxylate
3-Oxocyclobutanecarboxylic acid(3.0 g, 26.3 mmol), benzyl bromide(6.7 g, 39.4 mmol) and potassium carbonate(7.3 g, 52.6 mmol) was dissolved in acetone(30 mL), and then heated to reflux for 10 hours. After TLC showed that the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduce pressure to remove the solvent, added water (20 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (150 mLÃ—2). The combined organic phase was washed with saturated salt water(50 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was purified through silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate=10:1) to give benzyl 3-oxocyclobutane-carboxylate (2.5 g, 41.9% yield) as a colorless liquid.
