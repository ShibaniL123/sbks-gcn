Example 41. (R)-3-((3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)piperidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile
70.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(piperidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask, and then dissolved with 1.50 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 64.0 mg of 3-cyanobenzenesulfonyl chloride was added to the solution, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0790 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and then stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 70.0 mg of (R)-3-((3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)piperidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile was obtained with a yield of about 59.3%.
