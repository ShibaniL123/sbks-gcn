Example 3
(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
3-(2-((2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)amino)propyl)phenol
3-(2-aminopropyl)phenol 3a (220 mg, 2.3 mmol, prepared by a method disclosed in the patent application "WO2009068177"), 2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 1b (651 mg, 2.9 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (559 mg, 4.365 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The resulting mixture was heated to 90Â°C and stirred for 12 hours under an argon atmosphere. The reaction was stopped, and the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound 3-(2-((2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)amino)propyl)phenol 3b (113 mg, yield 35%) as a brown liquid.
