Preparation of compound 39-e.
Compound 39-f (2.0 g, 4.68 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) and the reaction solution was cooled to -78°C. Then n-butyllithium (2.8 mL, 7 mmol, 2.5 M solution in n-hexane), was added dropwise to the above solution, and the stirring was continued for 1 hour after the addition. A solution of formylpiperidine (795 mg, 7.03 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (1 mL) was added dropwise to the above solution and stirring was continued for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and quenched with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (50 mL), the mixed solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL × 3). The combined organic phases were washed successively with water (50 mL) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 2: 1) to delivera pale yellow solid 39-e (680 mg, yield: 39%).
