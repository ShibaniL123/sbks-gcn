Step 3
To Compound 3i (15.34g, 81mmol) were added toluene (30mL), sodium bromide (0.83 g, 8.1mmol) and 85 (w/w)% sulfuric acid (26.1mL, 403mmol), and the mixture was stirre d for 1 hour at 70°C. In addition, 85 (w/w)% sulfuric acid (26.1mL, 403mmol) was add ed thereto, and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours at 70°C. After the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice bath, methanol (150 mL) was added thereto, and the mixture wa s refluxed for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled in an ice bath, and extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of water (150mL). The organic layer was successively washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrocarbonate solution, water, and saturated br ine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under r educed pressure. The obtained residue was solidified with ethyl acetate - hexane to yi eld Compound 4i (11.45g, yield 64%) as an orange solid.
