(Reference Example 15) Synthesis of (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1,3-dione:
(R)-3-dimethylaminopyrrolidine (0.106 g, 0.927 mmol) was added to ethyl 3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-3-oxopropanoate (0.200 g, 1.02 mmol) at room temperature. The reaction liquid was stirred at 110Â°C for 6 hours and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (NH silica gel, chloroform/methanol) to obtain (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1,3-dione (0.220 g, 0.832 mmol, 90%) as a colorless oil.
