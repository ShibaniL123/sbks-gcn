4-{[(6-Iodo-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}-2-oxabicyclo [2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid
0.8 ml (0.8 mmol) of 1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution were added to a solution of 98 mg (0.14 mmol) of the compound from Example 112A in a mixture of 4.3 ml of THF and 0.9 ml of methanol, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 2 h. 2 ml of 10% strength aqueous citric acid solution were then added, and the mixture was allowed to stand at RT overnight. The mixture was then, without further work-up, pre-purified directly by preparative HPLC (Method 3). The pre-purified product was then purified once more by preparative HPLC (column: Kinetix C18, 5 μm, 100×30 mm; mobile phase: acetonitrile/water gradient]. This gave 37 mg (49% of theory, purity 98%) of the title compound
