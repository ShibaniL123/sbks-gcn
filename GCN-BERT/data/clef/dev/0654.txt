EXAMPLE 78
5-(2-chloro-3-methanesulphonyl-phenyl)-3-isopropyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 78)
A solution containing 2 mg (2 μmol) of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in 76 μl (0.7 mmol) of hydrogen peroxide is added to 22 mg (40 μmol) of 5-(2-chloro-3-methylsulphanyl-phenyl)-3-isopropyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (prepared as described in example 76.4), in 0.9 ml of ethanol. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, it is hydrolysed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed twice with 10% aqueous solution of sodium thiosulphate, once with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The product precipitates in diethyl ether and then the solvent is removed under nitrogen and the white solid obtained is dried under vacuum. 18 mg (76%) of 5-(2-chloro-3-methanesulphonyl-phenyl)-3-isopropyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid.
