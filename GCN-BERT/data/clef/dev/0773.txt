Step 1-5, preparation of {1-[6-(3-carbamoyl-5-fluoro-phenyl)-7-chloro-3-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-cinnolin-4-yl]-piperidin-4-yl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester: A mixture of {1-[6-bromo-7-chloro-3-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-cinnolin-4-yl]-piperidin-4-yl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (50 mg, 0.09 mmol), 3-carbamoyl-5-fluorobenzeneboronic acid (25 mg, 0.14 mmol), PdCl2(t-Bu2PPhNMe2)2 (6.5 mg, 0.009 mmol), and K2CO3 (25 mg, 0.18 mmol) in dioxane/H2O (10/1=2 mL/0.2 mL) was degassed with N2 for 5 min, and then sealed. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at 80Â° C. and cooled to room temperature. The reaction was filtered through a pad of celite, and the volatile solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was directly purified by column chromatography to afford the title compound (30 mg, 54%). MS (M+H)+=608.3.
