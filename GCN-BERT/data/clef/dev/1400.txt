Step 4. 7-Bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-ol
A solution of 2-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-ol (1.46 g, 7.19 mmol) in DMF (25 mL) was treated with NBS (1.41 g, 7.91 mmol) for 1 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (100 mL), acidified to pH 2 using 1 N HCl, and was extracted with EtOAc twice. The combined organic extracts were washed with water (3Ã—100 mL) and brine (100 mL), dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to afford a white solid (1.92 g, 95%). LCMS for C6H3BrF3N4O (M+H)+: calculated m/z=282.9, 284.9; found 283.0, 285.0.
