6-(2-Chloroacetyl)-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-2-one (0.50 g, 2.10 mmol) and thiourea (0.17 g, 2.21 mmol) suspended in anhydrous ethanol (4 ml) in a sealed tube under argon atmosphere. The sealed tube was microwaved at 120° C. for 35 min. The mixture was diluted with tetrahydrofuran (100 mL), neutralized with triethylamine (2 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (2×200 mL) followed by washing with saturated sodium bicarbonate (2×100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by precipitating in dichloromethane and filtration to give 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-1-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.50 g, 92%) as a vanilla solid.
