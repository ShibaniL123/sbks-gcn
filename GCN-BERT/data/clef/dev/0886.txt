(6)Preparation of 6-bromo-7-methyl-5-nitro-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin
7-Methyl-5-nitro-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin (13 g, 66.61 mmol)was dissolved in 200mL N,N-dimethyl formamide, and N-bromosuccinimide (23.7g, 133.2 mmol)was added in batch. The resultant mixture was heated to 60°C, and the reaction was carried out overnight. After the reaction, 200mL water was added, and the resultant mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×200mL). The organic phases were combined, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate=5:1) to obtain the product (12 g, yield: 66%).
