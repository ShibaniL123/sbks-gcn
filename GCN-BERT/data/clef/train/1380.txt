Step 6: N-cyclopropyl-2,2-difluoro-2-(4-(thiophen-3-yl)-3-(3-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) ureido)phenyl)acetamide
A solution of 2-(3-amino-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)-N-cyclopropyl-2,2-difluoroacetamide (50.0 mg, 0.16 mmol) and 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl isocyanate (35.5 mg, 0.19 mmol) in dichloromethane (50 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was separated directly by column chromatography on silica gel to afford N-cyclopropyl-2,2-difluoro-2-(4-(thiophen-3-yl)-3-(3-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ureido)phenyl) acetamide (68.3 mg, yield 85.01%).
