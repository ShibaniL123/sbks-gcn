Step 1. tert-Butyl 4-(6-cyano-1-trityl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)-3-fluoro-5-methylbenzyl(methyl)carbamate
A vial was charged with 5-chloro-1-trityl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine-6-carbonitrile (see step 4 in example 62, 449.7 mg, 1.068 mmol), bis(di-tert-butyl(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-phosphine)dichloropalladium(II) (76.2 mg, 0.108 mmol) and CsF (668.8 mg, 4.40 mmol). The vial was sealed, evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen (this process was repeated a total of three times). A solution of tert-butyl (3-fluoro-5-methyl-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzyl)(methyl)carbamate (Intermediate 2, 557.8 mg, 1.471 mmol) in butan-1-ol (9.00 ml) was added, followed by water (3.00 ml). After stirring at 60Â° C. for 90 min, the reaction mixture was concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (40 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as a yellow semi-solid (585.9 mg, 86%).
