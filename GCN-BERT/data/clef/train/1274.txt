Example 1. Synthesis and Characterization of (ferrocenylmethyl)trimethylammonium chloride (FcNCl)
A 250 mL Schlenk flask was degassed with N2 and maintained under N2. (ferrocenylmethyl)dimethylamine (15 g, 61.7 mmol) and methyl chloride (1 M in t-Butylether, 61.7 mL for 61.7 mmol, used 70 mL) were combined in 50 mL CH3CN in the 250 mL flask. The reaction mixture was stirred at R.T. overnight. The orange precipitate was formed and collected by filtration. 100 mL ether was added to the supernatant solution to precipitate a second crop of the product. The combined product was washed with 40 mL ether twice and dried under vacuum. The product was hydroscopic and stored in a dry desiccator. The yield was approximately 91% (16.5 g).
Mixing of (ferrocenylmethyl)dimethylamine with CH3Cl in CH3CN at R.T. resulted in the formation of red-orange FcNCl precipitates with a yield greater than 91% (see above). The one-step N-alkylation reaction was demonstrated on a 15 g lab scale based on (ferrocenylmethyl)dimethylamine. FcNCl was fully characterized by
FcNCl is surprisingly highly soluble in H2O with a solubility of approximately 4.0 M, corresponding to a theoretical capacity 114.4 Ah/L, a desired character for redox flow battery applications. It is hypothesized, without being bound to a particular theory, such high solubility is derived from its hydrophilic pendant ammonium functionality and Clâˆ’ counter ion.
