Synthesis of 1-ethyl-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridine-2-carboxylic acid
To a 30-mL round bottom flask, 6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridine-2-carboxylic acid (129 mg, 925 µmol) and 1,1-diethoxy-N,N-dimethylmethaneamine (1.5 mL) were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 100°C for 2 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to column chromatography (silica gel, 10 g) using methanol and chloroform (concentration gradient, 0 to 20%) as the elution solvent to obtain ethyl 1-ethyl-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridine-2-carboxylate (104 mg, 58%) as colorless oily substance.
