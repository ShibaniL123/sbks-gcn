Example 106A
(2-methoxyquinolin-3-yl)methanol
2-Methoxyquinoline-3-carbaldehyde (1.45 g, 7.75 mmol) was suspended in methanol (20 mL) and cooled to 0° C. Sodium borohydride (600 mg, 15.86 mmol) was added, causing bubbling. The reaction mixture stirred at 0° C. to room temperature overnight (ice bath melted). The reaction mixture was concentrated, and the crude material was taken up in saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (50 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (2×50 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to provide the title compound (1.46 g, 7.72 mmol, 100% yield).
