3-chloro-4-nitrophenol (273.34 mg, 1.58 mmol) was added to 20 ml of chlorobenzene solution of compound 84B (300.42 mg, 1.05 mmol). The mixture was then heated to 130-140 Â°C and stirred for 96 hours and spin-dried. The residue was then purified by preparative HPLC to give a yellow compound 84C as a solid (200 mg, the yield was 45.01%).
