(Comparative) Example 1: Synthesis of HHQ (Compound 1)
Synthesis of methyl-3-oxodecanoate (1a)
5.041 g 2,2-Dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (Meldrum's acid) (34.95 mmol) was solved in DCM (50 ml) and cooled to 0° C. 5.5 ml Pyridine (68.27 mmol) was added and after 20 minute at 0°C, 6.0 ml octanoyl chloride (35.15 mmol) was added dropwise. The resulting orange solution was allowed to stir for 1 h at 0°C and 1 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was washed with 5% HCl (3 x 60 ml), distilled water (2 x 60 ml) and Brine (2 x 60 ml). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The remaining brown oil was solved in 100 ml MeOH and refluxed for 5 h. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using hexane/ethyl acetate (4:1). The product was obtained as a colorless oil (m = 4.5 g, 64.2 %). Rf = 0.62 (hexane/ethyl acetate 4:1).
