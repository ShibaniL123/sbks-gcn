Example 164A
Ethyl 2,4-dioxo-3-(2-phenylethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate
In a microwave oven (Biotage Initiator with dynamic control of irradiation power), divided between two reaction vessels, a mixture of 4.21 g (10.8 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 161A, 2.52 g (23.8 mmol) of sodium carbonate and 2.4 ml (21.7 mmol) of ethyl mercaptoacetate in 26 ml of ethanol was heated to 120Â° C. for 1 h. Subsequently, the two batches are combined and concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was taken up in about 700 ml of ethyl acetate and the mixture was washed successively with about 300 ml each of semisaturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, water and saturated sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated. The crude product was purified by MPLC (Puriflash cartridge, 100 g of silica gel, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 5:1-1:1). After combination and evaporation of the product fractions and drying of the residue under high vacuum, 3.2 g (71% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
