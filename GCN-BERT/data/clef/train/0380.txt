[3] Synthesis of N2-phenoxyacetyl-5'-O-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-2'-O-(2-cyanoethoxymethoxymethyl)guanosine (3d)
N2-phenoxyacetyl-2'-O-(2-cyanoethoxymethoxymethyl)guanosine (3c) (630 mg, 1.2 mmol)) was azeotropically distilled with pyridine, and dried in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in pyridine (6.0 mL), 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl chloride (600 mg, 1.8 mmol) was added at 0Â° C. and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. After completion of the reaction, methanol was added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. To the residue was added dichloromethane and the mixture was washed twice with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and once with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The organic layer after washing was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane:ethyl acetate=1:1, containing 0.05% pyridine) to give the object compound (3d) (800 mg, purity 99.0%, yield 80%). The instrumental analytical values of compound (3d) are shown below.
