Step 11 Synthesis of compound 53n
To a solution of the compound 53m (650 mg, 0.90 mmol) in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile (3 mL) and dimethylacetamide (3 mL), 37% peracetic acid (0.258 mL, 1.44 mmol) was added dropwise at -20°C. The mixture was stirred at -20°C for 1 hour. Then, an aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen sulfite was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by water, an aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate, and brine in this order and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to afford the compound 53n (397 mg, yield 60%) as a white foam.
