Preparation of 2,2-difluoro-3-(trityloxy)propan-1-ol
2,2-Difluoropropane-1,3-diol (2.50 g, 22.3 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (61.7 mL) and THF (15.4 mL). DIPEA (3.93 mL, 22.3 mmol) was added, followed by (chloromethanetriyl)tribenzene (6.22 g, 22.3 mmol) and finally DMAP (0.288 g, 2.23 mmol). The reaction was heated to 40Â° C. for 2 hours. After cooling, the reaction was washed with 1N HCl solution, then dried and evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 25% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 2,2-difluoro-3-(trityloxy)propan-1-ol (4.43 g, 56%) as a colourless solid.
