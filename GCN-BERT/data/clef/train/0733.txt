Example 32
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol) and pyrimidine-2-carboxylic acid (0.056 g, 0.448 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.832 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.85 mL, 1.432 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50Â° C. for 4 days and precipitation formed. After cooling, the precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with cold 1:1 acetonitrile/water to give N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)pyrimidine-2-carboxamide (0.132 g, 93%) as a greenish-brown solid.
