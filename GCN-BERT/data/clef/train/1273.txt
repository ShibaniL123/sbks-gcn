Preparation of compound 34-d.
Compound 34-e (1.0 g, 4.98 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (10 mL), copper(II) bromide (1.9 g, 7.50 mmol) was added and tert-butyl nitrite (0.73 mL) was added slowly thereto. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80°C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with water (50 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic phase was washed successively with water (50 mL × 3) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 1:1) to delivera pale yellow solid 34-d (540 mg, yield: 41%).
