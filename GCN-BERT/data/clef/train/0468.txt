Step 3
The compound 56 (1.41 g, 7.30 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (14.1 mL). A 2 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (7.30 mL, 14.6 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred for 8 hours. Under ice cooling, a 2 mol/L aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid was added to the reaction mixture to render the reaction mixture acidic. NaCl was added to the mixture until saturated. The mixture was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed by brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained solids were washed by a solvent of ethyl acetate:n-hexane = 1:1 to give the compound 57 (0.75 g, yield 58%).
