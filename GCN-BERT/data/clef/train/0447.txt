Reference Example 2 Synthesis of methyl 5-bromo-2-methylthiopyrimidine-4-carboxylate
A solution of 5-bromo-2-(methylthio)pyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid (110 g, 0.44 mol) in methanol (1.1 L) was cooled to 0Â°C with stir, and thionyl chloride (50 mL, 0.66 mol) was added dropwise thereto. The resultant reaction mixture was slowly heated, and the reaction was allowed to proceed under reflux for four hours. The completion of the reaction was confirmed by LC/MS and TLC, and the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The volatiles were removed through evaporation under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (1 L). The resultant solution was washed three times with 10% aqueous sodium carbonate solution (200 mL) and then twice with saturated brine (200 mL). The resultant organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and solid was separated by filtration. The filtrate was then concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resultant crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography to yield the title compound (88 g, 75%).
