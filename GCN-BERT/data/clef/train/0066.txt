Compound 1G (400.68 mg, 2.78 mmol) was added to a solution of N,N-dimethylformamide (20 ml) at 25 °C under the protection of nitrogen, HATU (2.11 g, 5.56 mmol) and DIPEA (1.44 g, 11.12 mmol) were added thereto, and then compound 168A (955.65 mg, 2.78 mmol) was added thereto. The solution was stirred at 25 °C for 16 hours. The reaction solution was added to water (200 ml) and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 ml * 3). The organic phase was washed with saturated NaCl solution (100 ml * 2), and then washed with hydrochloric acid (2 mol/L, 50 ml * 2), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to give compound 168B (yellow solid, 710 mg, the yield was 54.35%). LCMS S (ESI) m/z: 470(M+1).
