Step 1-3, preparation of 6-bromo-4,7-dichloro-3-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-cinnoline: A mixture of 6-bromo-7-chloro-3-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-cinnolin-4-ol (1.1 g, 3 mmol) and POCl3 (10 mL) was stirred for 2.5 h at 100° C. During the reaction progress, the heterogenous solution became a clear solution. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, and slowly poured into ice (˜40 g) under ice cooling. The solid ppts were collected, washed with H2O, triturated in MeOH, filtered again, and dried to afford the title compound (1.1 g, 96%). MS (M+H)+=385.3.
