Intermediate 69: 5-Chloro-2-(difluoromethyl)-8-ethyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Step A: 8-Chloro-2-(difluoromethyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a suspension of 1,2-diamino-3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 61, 600 mg, 1.45 mmol) in MeOH (7.4 mL) was added Et3N (0.61 mL, 4.4 mmol), followed by methyl difluoroacetate (0.19 mL, 2.2 mmol) dropwise via syringe. The reaction was maintained at 45Â° C. and stirred for 16 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2, 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound (335 mg, 85% yield).
