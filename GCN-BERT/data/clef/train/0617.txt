The fourteenth step
To a mixed solution of Compound 27 (23mg, 0.050mmol) in THF (0.23mL), methanol (0.23mL) and water (0.02mL) was added 2mmol / L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (0.13mL, the 0.25 mmol), and the mixture was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere for 4 hours at 70 Â°C. The reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform after addition of 0.1mmol / L hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was separated from the aqueous layer with the organic layer phase separator. After concentrating the organic layer, optical resolution was carried out by DIOL chromatography (chloroform-methanol) and liquid chromatography, followed by purification to yield Compound I-10 (5mg, yield 22%).
