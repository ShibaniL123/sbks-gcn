[3] Synthesis of N4-acetyl-5'-O-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-2'-O-(2-cyanoethoxymethoxymethyl)cytidine (1d)
N4-acetyl-2'-O-(2-cyanoethoxymethoxymethyl) cytidine (1c) (15 g, 38 mmol) was azeotropically distilled with pyridine, and dried in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in pyridine (200 mL), 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl chloride (19 g, 57 mmol) was added at 0° C. and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hr. After completion of the reaction, methanol was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 min, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. To the residue was added dichloromethane and the mixture was washed twice with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and once with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The organic layer after washing was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate, containing 0.05% pyridine→ethyl acetate:acetone=1:1, containing 0.05% pyridine) to give the object compound (1d) (23 g, purity 99.2%, yield 86%). The instrumental analytical values of compound (1d) are shown below.
