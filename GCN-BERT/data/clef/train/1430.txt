Diethyl 2-(((3, 4-d fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)amino)methylene)malonate (3)
6-Amino-2,3-difluorophenol (2) (550 mg, 3.8 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (15 mL) and diethyl 2-(ethoxymethylene)malonate (819 mg, 3.8 mmol) was added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature until there was no starting material left. Ethanol was removed and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (EtOAc/hexane=1/3 to 3/1) to give product 3 as a brown solid (1.04 g, 87%).
