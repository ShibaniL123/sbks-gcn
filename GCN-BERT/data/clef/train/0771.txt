Example I-9 Synthesis of Compound 59
Synthesis of Compound 56
To a mixture of potassium carbonate (51.2 mg, 0.37 mmol) in water (5 mL) and compound 15 (50.0 mg, 0.25 mmol) in ethyl acetate (10 mL), a solution of acryloyl chloride (16 μL, 0.2 mmol) in ethyl acetate (8 mL) was dropwise added slowly at 0° C. Upon complete addition, the resulting mixture was stirred at 0° C. in an ice bath for additional 10 minutes. Then the mixture was allowed to raise to room temperature and reacted for 5 hours. The mixture was acidified with hydrochloric acid to adjust pH5. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (15 mL×3). The organic combined layers were washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (15 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and removed the solvent. The solid residue was purified by column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=8:1) to give product 56 (26.2 mg, 40.1%) as a gray oil. LC-MS m/z (ES+), 258.14 (M+H)+.
