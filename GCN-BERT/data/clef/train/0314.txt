5-Methyl-6-[(2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]-1-(tetrahydrofuran-2-ylmethyl)-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (racemate)
To a solution of 605 mg (1.30 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 410A in 13 ml of methanol were added first 242 mg (2.99 mmol) of potassium cyanate and then, dropwise, 190 Î¼l (2.21 mmol) of perchloric acid (70% in water). After the reaction mixture had been stirred at RT for about 42 h, the same amounts of potassium cyanate and perchloric acid again were added. After stirring for a further 4 days, the reaction mixture was admixed with semisaturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic extract was washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 8). The product fractions were concentrated and the residue was dried under high vacuum. 275 mg (47% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
