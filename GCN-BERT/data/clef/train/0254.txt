N-(1-(benzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine
1-(benzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-amine 4b (50 mg, 0.285 mmol), 2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 1b (128 mg, 0.57 mmol, prepared by a well-known method disclosed in "Journal of Organic Chemistry, 2005, 70(6), 2372-2375") and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (109 mg, 0.855 mmol) were dissolved in 3 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The resulting mixture was heated to 90Â°C and stirred for 12 hours under an argon atmosphere. The reaction was stopped, and the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound N-(1-(benzofuran-3-yl)-propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine 4c (50 mg, yield 70%) as a brown liquid.
