Step 1. benzyl 3-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)-3-methylazetidine-1-carboxylate
To a 0Â° C. solution of tert-butyl (3-methylazetidin-3-yl) carbamate (200 mg, 1.074 mmol) and Et3N (0.299 mL, 2.15 mmol) in DCM (6 mL) was added benzyl chloroformate (0.18 mL, 1.3 mmol) drop-wise. The solution was allowed to gradually warm to ambient temperature while stirring for 3 h. The crude reaction mixture was purified by CombiFlash chromatography (25 g silica gel column, eluting with 0-15% methanol/dichloromethane) to afford the desired product (183 mg, 53%). LCMS for C17H24N2O4 (M+Na)+: calculated m/z=343.4; found 343.1.
