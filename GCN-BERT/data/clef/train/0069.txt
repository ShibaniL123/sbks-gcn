Example 56A
3-Ethyl-5-methyl-1-(4,4,4-trifluorobutyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
Analogously to the method described in Ex. 54A, 1.0 g (4.76 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 42A and 1.70 g (7.13 mmol) of 1,1,1-trifluoro-4-iodobutane were used to prepare 1.35 g (90% of theory) of the title compound The reaction in the microwave was effected here at 100° C. and the reaction time was 1 h. The eluent gradient used in the MPLC purification was cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 20:1→10:1.
