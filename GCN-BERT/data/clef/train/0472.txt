Synthesis of 1-(3-fluoro-5-fluoromethoxypyridin-2-yl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one (Compound Example 110)
1-(3-Fluoro-5-hydroxy-2-pyridyl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methylpyrazol-4-yl)imidazo-[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one (80 mg, 0.19 mmol, 98%), potassium carbonate (52.4 mg, 0.38 mmol), N,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml) and bromofluoromethane (43.0 mg, 0.36 mmol, 95%) were initially introduced in a sealed 30 ml reaction vessel. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The reaction was then terminated by addition of water. The solution was then extracted three times with 10 ml of ethyl acetate each time, and the organic phases were combined. The residue was pre-purified on silica gel with EtOAC/MeOH (97/3). The crude product was purified by means of preparative HPLC, giving 45 mg (53%) of 1-(3-fluoro-5-fluoromethoxypyridin-2-yl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one as white solid.
