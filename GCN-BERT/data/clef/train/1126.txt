Step 5
3,7-Dimethyl-1-(2-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)ethyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
2-(3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)ethyl methanesulfonate (150 mg, 0.730 mmol), 3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (132 mg, 0.730 mmol) and cesium carbonate (357 mg, 1.10 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (3 mL). The reaction was heated to 100Â°C and stirred overnight. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, quenched by addition of water (15 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (10 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined, washed with brine (10 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by silica gel column chromatography to give 3,7-dimethyl-1-(2-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)ethyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (20.0 mg) with a yield of 10%.
