Step B: 2-(2-Cyclopropylethynyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium-1-amine,2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate. To a cooled (−5° C.) mixture of TFA (12.1 mL, 158 mmol) and water (1.4 mL) was added ethyl (1E)-N-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)sulfonyloxyethanimidate (3.38 g, 11.8 mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5 h. Ice water (60 mL) was added, and the resulting precipitate was collected and washed with water (10×10 mL). The solid was dissolved in DCM (40 mL), dried over MgSO4, and filtered. The filtrate was cooled to 0° C. and 2-(2-cyclopropylethynyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (1.67 g, 7.91 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to rt and stirred for 2 h. The mixture was cooled to 0° C. and diluted with Et2O (80 mL). The precipitate was collected and washed with Et2O (2×20 mL) to give the title compound (2.00 g, 59%) as a pale yellow solid.
