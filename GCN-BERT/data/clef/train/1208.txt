Step 4. Synthesis of N-(3,5-Dimethyl-1-(3-nitrobenzyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-4-((2-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)methyl)benzamide (IA18)
Compound IA18 was prepared from intermediate IA9b and 4-((2-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)methyl)benzoic acid (IA16) via an EDC-mediated amide formation in a fashion similar to the one described for compound A1. Yellow solid, 75 mg, 50% yield.
