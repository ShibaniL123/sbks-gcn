Reference Example C-18: Synthesis of 4-(aminomethyl)-2-[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridyl]phenol hydrochloride (C-18)
(step 1) Synthesis of (5-cyano-2-methoxy-phenyl)boronic acid
To 3-Bromo-4-methoxybenzonitrile (7.7 g, 36 mmol) and triisopropyl borate (14 g, 73 mmol) was added tetrahydrofuran (150 mL) for dissolution, and 2.5 mol/L n-butyllithium (hexane solution, 22 mL, 55 mmol) was gradually added over 20 min at - 78°C. After stirring at -78°C for 2 hr, 7% phosphoric acid (100 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and the mixture was heated to room temperature. The reaction mixture was partitioned, dichloromethane was added to the organic layer, and the mixture was extracted with 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (200 mL). The aqueous layer was washed with diethyl ether, adjusted to pH 2.5 by adding 85% phosphoric acid and insoluble material was collected by filtration. The obtained solid was washed with water and dried to give the title compound (5.1 g, 29 mmol, 79%).
