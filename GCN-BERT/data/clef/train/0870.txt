Step 2. 1-(Acetoxymethyl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane-4-carboxylic acid
A solution of (4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-1-yl)methyl acetate (329 mg, 1.8 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (3 mL)/acetonitrile (3.00 mL)/water (3.00 mL) at 0Â° C. was stirred rapidly while sodium periodate (1.13 g, 5.30 mmol) and ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (40 mg, 0.18 mmol) were added. The ice bath was removed, and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The reaction was diluted with EtOAc and stirred while 1M HCl was added until all solids dissolved. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc. The combined extracts were washed with 10% NaHSO3 solution, brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (0-20% MeOH/DCM) to afford the title compound as a white solid (340 mg, 96%).
