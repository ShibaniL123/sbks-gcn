Example 4D. 2-(4-((8-aminooctyl)oxy)-3-fluorobenzyl)-8-benzyl-6-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3(7H)-one (TAK-0057)
To a solution of tert-butyl (6-(4-((8-benzyl-3-oxo-6-phenyl-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-2-yl)methyl)-2-fluorophenoxy)octyl)carbamate (280 mg, 0.43 mmol) dissolved in dichloromethane (15 mL), trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was added. The mixture stirred for 1 h. The reaction was diluted with toluene and concentrated. Additional toluene was added and concentrated again (2Ã—) giving a brown gum. The crude product was dissolved in acetonitrile, and the resulting solution purified by preparative HPLC with ACN as the mobile phase. Product was isolated as a yellow solid (170 mg, 71%):
