Example 98A
Methyl 4-{[(6-ethynyl-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
At RT, 343 mg (0.90 mmol) of HATU and 0.31 ml (1.81 mmol) of DIPEA were added to a solution of 173 mg (0.60 mmol) of the compound from Example 97A in 1.5 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 30 min. Subsequently, 198 mg (0.90 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, dissolved in 1.5 ml of DMF, were added and the mixture was stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, the mixture was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 3). This gave 207 mg (74% of theory, purity 98%) of the title compound
