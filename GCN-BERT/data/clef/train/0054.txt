(124-1) Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-{5-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1H-imidazol-2-yl}pyrrolidin-2-on (Compound 124-1)
To a solution of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-oxopyrrolidin-3-carboxamide (300 mg) in dry DMF (5 mL) was added NaH (60% mineral oil dispersion, 75 mg) with stirring under ice cooling. After stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes, 4-trifluoromethoxyphenacyl bromide (391 mg) was added. The reaction was carried out at 110 °C for 3 hours, followed by at room temperature for 18 hours. After cooling to room temperature, water (30 mL) was added to stop the reaction. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL × 3). The combined ethyl acetate layer was washed with saturated brine (50 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-acetone) to obtain the title compound 100 mg (yield 18%).
