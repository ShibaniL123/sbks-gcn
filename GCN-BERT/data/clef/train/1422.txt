Preparation of: rac-trans-1-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6-oxopiperidin-3-yl)urea (Example 3)
To a stirred solution of rac-trans-5-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-2-one hydrochloride (0.15 g, 0.58 mmol, 1 eq) in DCM (10 mL) was added Et3N (0.13 mL, 0.87 mmol, 1.5 eq) followed by 4-bromophenylisocyanate (0.114 g, 0.58 mmol, 1 eq) at 0° C. and stirred for 2 h at RT. The reaction was quenched with H2O and the organics were extracted with DCM (2×15 ml), washed with brine (10 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (Neutral Alumina, 3% MeOH in DCM) followed by trituration with EtOAc to afford Example 3 (0.1 g, 24%) as white solid.
