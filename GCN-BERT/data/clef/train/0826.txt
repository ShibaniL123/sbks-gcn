(Example 9)
The first step
To a solution of Compound 45 (50.0mg, 0.106mmol) in THF (2 mL) was added 60% sodium hydride (12.8mg, 0.319mmol) under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere for 10 minutes. To the reaction mixture was added oxalyl chloride (0.211mL, 2.417mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was poured into a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 46 (22.3mg, yield 40%).
