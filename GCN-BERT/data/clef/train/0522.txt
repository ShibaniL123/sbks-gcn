Step 3
3,7-Dimethyl-1-(4-(3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)butyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
5-(4-Chlorobutyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazole (100 mg, 0.580 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (3 mL). 3,7-Dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (104 mg, 0.580 mmol), potassium carbonate (120 mg, 0.870 mmol) and potassium iodide (115 mg, 0.700 mmol) were added. The reaction solution was heated to 120Â°C and stirred for 16 hours, and then concentrated under reduced pressure, and purified by preparative HPLC to give 3,7-dimethyl-1-(4-(3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)butyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (25.0 mg) with a yield of 14%.
