(Reference Example 19) Synthesis of 1-propyl-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde:
A solution of 1-propyl-1H-imidazole (1.67 g, 15.2 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (30.4 mL) was cooled to -78°C. n-Butyllithium (1.62 M n-hexane solution, 10.3 mL, 16.7 mmol) was added to the reaction liquid at -78°C. The reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour and then N,N-dimethylformamide (1.41 mL, 18.2 mmol) was added at -78°C. After the reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour, the temperature of the reaction liquid was raised to room temperature. A saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride was added to the reaction liquid and then ethyl acetate was added. The organic layer was washed with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, n-hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain 1-propyl-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde (0.492 g, 3.56 mmol, 24%) as a colorless oil.
