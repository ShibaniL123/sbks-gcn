Step 2: methyl 5-methylpyrimidine-2-carboxylate
To a solution of methanol (50 mL) was added SOCl2 (5.17 g, 43.5 mmol, 3.00 equiv) dropwise at 0° C. The resulting solution was stirred for 0.5 h at 25° C. This was followed by the addition of 5-methylpyrimidine-2-carboxylic acid [Example 9, Step 1] (2 g, 14.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv). The resulting solution was stirred for 1 h at 65° C. The resulting mixture was concentrated under vacuum to remove methanol and SOCl2. The resulting solution was diluted with H2O (30 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×30 mL). The organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to afford 2 g (90.7%) of methyl 5-methylpyrimidine-2-carboxylate as a yellow solid.
