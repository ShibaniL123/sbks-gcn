Step 2: 2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(1,2-dimethyl-1H-indol-3-yl)acetate
To a stirring solution of the acid from step 1 (133.12 mg, 0.7 mmol) in DCM (8 mL) cooled to 0 °C, DCC (173.9 mg, 0.8 mmol) was added slowly, then DMAP (25.6 mg, 0.2 mmol) and finally N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (202.4 mg, 0.8 mmol), synthesized as reported in Example 1. The crude suspension was filtered to remove the DCU precipitate and then concentrated at 40 °C. The product was purified by column chromatography (3% MeOH in DCM). 108.5 mg of the final product were obtained (38%).
