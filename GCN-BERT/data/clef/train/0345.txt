Synthesis of methyl 8-oxo-4-phenyl-8-(phenylamino)octanoate (8e)
8-Methoxy-8-oxo-5-phenyloctanoic acid 7e (0.763 g, 2.89 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (25 mL), then aniline (0.32 mL, 3.47 mmol) was added, followed by 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (0.424 g, 3.47 mmol). The mixture was stirred until 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine was completely dissolved, then dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (0.716 g, 3.47 mmol) was added, and the reaction was stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 10% aqueous HCl (40 mL), the organic layer was washed with a saturated NaHCO3 solution, and then brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated, and purified by column chromatography (acetone:petroleum ether 1:6) to give 8e (704 mg, 72%).
