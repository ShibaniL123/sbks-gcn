(2) The preparation of 1-[(6-fluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-bromoxanthine
Adding 3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-bromoxanthine (2.9 g, 9.8 mmol), potassium carbonate (2.2 g, 16 mmol) and 2-bromomethyl-6-fluorobenzonitrile (2.3 g, 10.7 mmol) into a 100mL round-bottom flask, adding 25mL of N,N-dimethylformamides, heating to 80Â°C and stirring for 5 hours; after the reaction was completed, pouring the reaction liquid into ice water to precipitate solid, filtrating by air pump, washing solid with water and drying to obtain 3.5 g yellowish solid, with a yield of 84%. ES-API(m/z):[M+H]+ 430.0.
