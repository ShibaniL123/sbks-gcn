Step 2
1-(4-(Benzofuran-2-yl)butyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
2-(4-Chlorobutyl)benzofuran (500 mg, 2.40 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (10 mL), potassium carbonate (662 mg, 4.80 mmol), 3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (432 mg, 2.40 mmol) and potassium iodide (478 mg, 2.88 mmol) were added. The reaction was heated to 120Â°C and stirred for 16 hours, then cooled to room temperature, followed by adding water (30 mL) to quench the reaction. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL x 2). The organic phase was combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (1:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.5) to give 1-(4-(benzofuran-2-yl)butyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (200 mg) with a yield of 24%.
