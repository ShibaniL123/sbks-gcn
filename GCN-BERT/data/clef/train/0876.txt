[Reaction Scheme 7-4] Synthesis of [Compound 44]
The same procedure as in Reaction Scheme 1-13 of Synthesis Example 1 was carried out, with the exception of using Intermediate 6-h and Intermediate 7-c instead of Intermediate 1-h and Intermediate 1-l, respectively, to afford Compound 44 (4.1 g): yield 36.3%
