Step 5: Preparation of tert-butyl 4-(4-(3-(N-phenylpentaneamido)prop-1-ynyl)benzoyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate
The N-phenylpentaneamide (185 mg, 1.04 mmol) obtained in Step 1 and sodium hydride (NaH; 75 mg, 3.12 mmol) were cooled on ice, and then tetrahydrofuran (THF; 8 ml) was added, followed by stirring for 30 minutes. The tert-butyl 4-(4-(3-(methylsulfonyloxy)prop-1-ynyl)benzoyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (662 mg, 1.57 mmol) obtained in Step 4 was added to the mixture, the ice was removed, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 17 hours. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue obtained thereby was diluted with dichloromethane and washed with water and brine. An organic solvent layer was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Hex:EA=4:1), thereby obtaining a final product, tert-butyl 4-(4-(3-(N-phenylpentaneamido)prop-1-ynyl)benzoyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (382 mg, 73% yield).
