Example 501A
Ethyl 1-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3-[(2S)-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-yl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate
493 mg (3.57 mmol) of potassium carbonate were added to a solution of 500 mg (1.43 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 497A in 10 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 15 min. Then 397 mg (2.85 mmol) of 2-bromoethyl methyl ether were added. The mixture was stirred at 60Â° C. for about 18 h. Thereafter, about 50 ml of water were added to the reaction mixture at RT and extraction was effected with ethyl acetate. The organic extract was washed with sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The remaining residue was purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8). After concentration of the product fractions and drying under high vacuum, 270 mg (46% of theory) of the title compound were obtained (99% ee, chiral analytical HPLC).
