Example 69A
Methyl 4-{[(6-bromo-3-ethyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
150 mg (0.42 mmol) of the compound from Example 35A were initially charged in 1.5 ml (20.6 mmol) of thionyl chloride and stirred at RT for 2.5 h and then at 60Â° C. overnight. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue, after drying under reduced pressure, was taken up in 1 ml of anhydrous THF. The suspension present was added slowly to a mixture of 0.28 ml (1.60 mmol) of DIPEA and 106 mg (0.48 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride in 1.4 ml of anhydrous THF, and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT overnight. After addition of ethyl acetate and water, the phases were separated and the organic phase was washed with sat. sodium carbonate solution, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 11 mg (5% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
