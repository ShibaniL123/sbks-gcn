(6) Preparation of (2S,5R)-2-((3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate (Compound 5)
Tert-butyl 8-((2S',5R)-7-oxo-6-(sulfooxy)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxamido)-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]o ctane-3-carboxylate (0.42 g, 0.88 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL), and then trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was added. The reaction solution was stirred and reacted at 25 Â°C for 1 h, concentrated, and acetone (10 mL) was added. The reaction solution was stirred for 10 min, and the solution of sodium iso-octoate in acetone was added. The reaction systerm was regulated to have pH of 5, stirred for 10 min, filtrated, and the obtained filter cake was separated and purified by Combiflash automatic rapid purification chromatography (mobile phase was water) to obtain the title compound in white color form (30 mg, yield 9.1 %).
