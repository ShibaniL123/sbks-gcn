Synthesis of Compound 65
Tocopherol (864 mL, 2.01 mmol) was dissolved in acetone (20 mL). Then, 6-bromo-1-hexanol (816 μL 6.03 mmol) and potassium carbonate (829 mg, 6.03 mmol) were added thereto, and the mixture was refluxed at 76° C. After 48 hours, the completion of reaction was confirmed by TLC, and then acetone was distilled off under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was subjected to extraction with distilled water and ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was washed with brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Then, the organic layer was distilled under reduced pressure using an evaporator. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:EtOAc=8:1). A compound 65 (855 mg, 1.61 mmol, 80%) was obtained as a yellow oil.
