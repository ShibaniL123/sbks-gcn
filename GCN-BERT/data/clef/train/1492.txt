Step 4: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl 3-(allyloxyamino)-5-oxazol-2-yl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylate (7d)
The tert-butyl 3-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-5-oxazol-2-yl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylate (7c) (512 mg, 1.01 mmol) was dissolved in ACN (6.3 mL) and K2CO3 (978 mg, 7.08 mmol) and thiophenol (415 ÂµL, 4.04 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at rt for 5h and the mixture was diluted with DCM and filtered on a pad of silica gel to eliminate the excess of PhSH. Then the pad was washed with (9/1)DCM/MeOH and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (DCM/acetone: 100/0 to 90/10) to provide tert-butyl 3-(allyloxyamino)-5-oxazol-2-yl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylate (7d) (263 mg, 0.82 mmol, 81%).
