Step 3
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(2-methyloxazol-5-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-ethynyl-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 49b (20 mg, 0.045 mmol) was dissoved in 4 mL of acetonitrile, then 8-methylquinoline-1-oxide 49c (9.4 mg, 0.058 mmol, prepared by a well-known method disclosed in "ChemMedChem, 2009, 4(2), 249-260") and [bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imidate](triphenylphosphine)gold(I) (1.7 mg, 0.00225 mmol) were added, and the reaction was warmed up to 60Â°C and stirred for 3 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(2-methyloxa zol-5-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 49d (13 mg, yield 58%) as a light yellow solid.
