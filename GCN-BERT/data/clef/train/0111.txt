Preparation of Di-tert-butyl ((4-(4-((1-(trans-4-ethoxycyclohexyl)-3-(pyrazin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)carbamoyl)oxazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)methyl) phosphate 11-16
In a round bottom flask, to a DMF (8 mL) solution of N-(1-(trans-4-ethoxycyclohexyl)-3-(pyrazin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)oxazole-4-carboxamide I-1 (897 mg, 2 mmol), Cs2CO3 (977.5 mg, 3 mmol) was added at room temperature, after 30 minutes, followed by di-tert-butyl (chloromethyl) phosphate (1.03 g, 4 mmol). At 23 hours, by LC-MS, 7% of I-1 was still present. Additional di-tert-butyl (chloromethyl) phosphate (0.4 g, 1.5 mmol) and Cs2CO3 (0.2 g, 0.6 mmol) were added and after another 24 hours, about 3% I-1 remained. With ice bath cooling, the reaction was quenched by dropwise addition of water (24 mL), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. Precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water, and was further dried under high vacuum. Compound di-tert-butyl ((4-(4-((1-(trans-4-ethoxycyclohexyl)-3-(pyrazin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)carbamoyl)oxazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)methyl) phosphate II-16 was obtained as a light beige color solid: 1.33 g (99% yield).
