Step 5. 7-Bromo-4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-f][1,2,4]triazine
7-Bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-ol (1.92 g, 6.80 mmol) was heated to 110° C. in POCl3 (20.0 mL, 215 mmol) for 30 minutes. Upon cooling to room temperature, POCl3 was removed in vacuo. The residue was poured into a mixture of ice water. The aqueous mixture was made basic by the addition of sat'd NaHCO3 solution, and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3×). The combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The product was used without further purification in the next step (2.0 g, 98%). LCMS for C6H2BrClF3N4 (M+H)+: calculated m/z=300.9, 302.9; found 301.0, 303.0.
