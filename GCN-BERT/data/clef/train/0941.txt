(E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(5-ethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3 -methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(5-ethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3 ,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 46c (50 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL of methanol, then 0.3 mL of 1M lithium hydroxide solution was added. The reaction was stirred for 12 hours at room temperature. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove methanol. 1M hydrochloric acid was added dropwise to adjust the pH to 3. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mLÃ—2 mL). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(5-ethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3 -methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid 46 (10 mg, yield 20%) as a yellow solid.
