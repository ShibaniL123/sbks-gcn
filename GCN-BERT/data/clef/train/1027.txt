[Step 2] Synthesis of N-(2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)-3-methylbutanamide
Methyl 3-fluoro-4-((N-(3-fluorophenyl)-3-methylbutanamido)methyl)benzoate (0.115 g, 0.318 mmol), synthesized in step 1, and hydrazine monohydrate (0.309 mL, 6.364 mmol) were mixed in ethanol (6 mL) at room temperature, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 18 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The title compound was used without further purification (0.105 g, 91.3%) as colorless oil.
