Step 2
Methyl 2-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl) acetate
2-(3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl) acetic acid (2.40 g, 17.0 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (30 mL), and conc. sulfuric acid (8.34 g, 85.0 mmol) was added. The reaction solution was heated under reflux for 2 hours, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with water (30 mL), adjusted to pH 8 with saturated sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution (20 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL x 2). The organic phases were combined, washed with saturated sodium chloride aqueous solution (20 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, then purified by silica gel column chromatography (5:1 petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.5) to give methyl 2-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl) acetate (2.00 g, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 76%.
