Example 57. Synthesis of 6-((3,5-Dimethyl-4-(4-((4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)methyl)-benzamido)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)methyl)-N-methylpicolinamide (E1a)
Step 1. Synthesis of Methyl 6-((3,5-Dimethyl-4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)methyl)picolinate (IE3a)
A solution of IE1a (600 mg, 4.0 mmol), NBS (712 mg, 4.0 mmol) and AIBN (131 mg, 0.8 mmol) in CCl4 (15 mL) was heated at 70Â° C. for 2 h. After the solvent was evaporated in vacuo, the residue was purified by flash column chromatography (0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford an inseparable mixture of IE2a and IE1a. To a solution of 3,5-dimethyl-4-nitropyrazole (141 mg, 1.0 mmol) and KOtBu (135 mg, 1.2 mmol) in DMF (5 ml) was added the above mixture and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir rt for 12 h. The reaction was quenched with NH4Cl (sat.) and EtOAc (50 mL) was added. The organic layer was separated, washed with H2O (150 mL) and brine (100 mL), and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (0-80% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford compound IE3a as a light yellow oil (230 mg, 79%).
