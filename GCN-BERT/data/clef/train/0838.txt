Example 1-2 : Preparation of 1,1'-(3-methoxypyridin-2,6-diyl)diethanone (IV)
2,6-Dibromo-3-methoxypyridine (III) (450 mg, 1.69 mmole), palladium (II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) (15.14 mg, 67.44 µmole), and 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (DPPP) (55.63 mg, 134.87 µmole) were dissolved in 3mL of ethylene glycol. To the resulting reaction mixture butyl vinyl ether (1.09 mL, 8.43 mmole) and triethylamine (TEA) (704.94 µL, 50.6 mmole) were slowly added dropwise. The resulting mixture was stirred at 125 °C for 24 hrs and cooled to room temperature. 2 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) was slowly added dropwise thereto to adjust pH to 1∼2 and the mixture was stirred for 30 min and neutralized. The resulting solution was diluted with dichloromethane and washed with water. Then, the organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-Hex/EA = 3/1) to give the title compound (120 mg, 37 %).
