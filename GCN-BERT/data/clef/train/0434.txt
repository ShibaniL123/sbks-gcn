Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-{3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-yl}pyrrolidin-2-one (Compound 121)
(121-1) Synthesis of 5-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,3,4-oxathiazol-2-one (Compound 121-1)
Chlorocarbonylsulfenyl chloride (0.25 mL) was added to a suspension of 4-(trifluoromethoxy)benzamide (500 mg) in toluene (30 mL) with stirring at room temperature. The reaction was carried out at 120 °C for 16 hours. After cooling to room temperature, a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (50 mL) was added to the reaction solution to terminate the reaction. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL × 2). The combined organic layer was washed with saturated brine (50 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to obtain the title compound 450 mg (yield 70%).
