Step 2. (R)-2-Methyl-N-(1-deutero-4-oxocyclohexyl)propane-2-sulfinamide
A solution of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (0.13 g, 0.71 mmol) in water (4.9 mL) was added to a solution of ((R)-2-methyl-N-(8-deutero-1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)propane-2-sulfinamide (3.7 g, 14 mmol) in acetone (9.8 mL). The reaction mixture was then heated at 100° C. for 15 min in a microwave. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and washed with sat. NaHCO3. The organic layer was removed, and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2×). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (70-100% EtOAc in DCM, then 0-5% MeOH in EtOAc) afforded the title compound as an off-white solid (2.3 g, 75%).
