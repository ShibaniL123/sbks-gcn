Step 6 Synthesis of compound 1i
The compound 1h (0.75 g, 1.06 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (4 ml) and DMA (4 ml). The solution was cooled to -20Â°C. Then, 37% peracetic acid solution (0.20 ml, 1.11 mmol) was added to the solution. Under ice cooling, the mixture was stirred for 1 hour. Then, the reaction mixture was separated into aqueous and organic layers by the addition of 10% aqueous solution of sodium sulfite and ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by water, a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate and brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate was filtered off. Then, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, followed by elution with hexane/ethyl acetate. Fractions containing the desired compound were concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the compound 1i (0.64 g, yield 84%) as an isomeric mixture of sulfoxide.
