Example 80: Synthesis of compound 11360, N-((5-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)isonicotinamide
[Sep 1] Synthesis of N-((5-(2-(2,2-difluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)isonicotinamide
N-(3-fluorophenyl)-N-((5-(hydrazinecarbonyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)isonicotinamide (0.120 g, 0.328 mmol), synthesized in step 2 of Example 79, and triethylamine (0.092 mL, 0.657 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and 2,2-difluoroacetic anhydride (0.046 mL, 0.427 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The title compound was used without further purification (0.140 g, 96.1%) as colorless oil.
