Comparative Example 12: Synthesis of (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine.diacetate
Isopropanol solution (30.16 g) containing (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine (5.03 g: 39.9 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and acetic acid (4.75 g: 79.1 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine-diacetate (4.41 g: 17.9 mmol, yield=45%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 105° C., 135° C.
