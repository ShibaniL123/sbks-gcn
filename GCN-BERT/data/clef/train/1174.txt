Step 5
1-(2-(3,5-Dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)ethyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
2-(3,5-Dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)ethyl methanesulfonate (100 mg, 0.457 mmol), 3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (82.2 mg, 0.457 mmol), potassium iodide (7.2 mg, 0.046 mmol) and potassium carbonate (126 mg, 0.914 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (3 mL). The reaction solution was heated to 120°C and reacted for 3 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to 20°C, filtered and purified by preparative HPLC to give 1-(2-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)ethyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (50.0 mg) with a yield of 36%.
