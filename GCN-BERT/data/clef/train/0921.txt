Third Step: Synthesis of Intermediate 4
23.0 g (47.46 mol) of Intermediate 3 was mixed with 230 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide in a 500 ml flask, and the mixture was internally cooled down to −10° C. The internal temperature was maintained at −10° C., while 9.29 g (52.21 mol) of N-bromosuccinimide was slowly added thereto. When a reaction was complete, a resultant obtained after removing a solvent was treated through column chromatography to obtain 17.4 g of Intermediate 4 (a yield of 65%).
