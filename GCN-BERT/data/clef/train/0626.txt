(4) 4-(4-Iodophenyl)-1-(6-nitro-1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazol-1-yl)butane-1-thione
N-(2-Amino-5-nitrophenyl)-4-(4-iodophenyl)butanethioamide (5.68 g, 12.8 mmol) was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (diluted with 5% water, 300 mL) by gentle warming at 40° C. The solution was cooled to 0° C. and NaNO2 (1.32 g, 19.2 mmol, 1.5 eq) was added in portions over 20 min with stirring. After 30 min, the precipitated product was filtered, washed with water and the filtrate was extracted with EtOAc (2×150 mL). The combined organic phases were washed successively with H2O (3×100 mL), saturated NaHCO3 (2×100 mL), and brine (2×100 mL), was dried, and then was evaporated to dryness. The obtained solid was sonicated in a small amount of EtOAc (5 mL). The EtOAc was decanted away and the remaining solid was filtered. The product (yellow solid, 3.23 g, 56%) was combined and dried in vacuo.
