d) A mixture of 1,1-dimethylindan-5-sulfonyl chloride (0.030 g, 0.13 mmol) and 3-methyl-1-(quinolin-5-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-amine (prepared from Example 4 step b, 0.028 g, 0.12 mmol) in pyridine (0.12 mL) was heated at 80Â° C. for 1 h with stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting crude residue was purified by flash chromatography (SiO2, 20% ethyl acetate in hexanes), followed by reverse phase HPLC (C18 column, acetonitrile-H2O with 0.1% TFA as eluent) to give the title compound as a white solid (0.015 g, 0.036 mmol, 28%).
