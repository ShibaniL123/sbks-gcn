Step 2 Synthesis of Compound 140
To Compound 139 (140 mg, 223 µmol) in tetrahydrofuran (1.4 mL) solution was added 1.0 mol/L tetrabutylammonium fluoride solution (668 µL, 668 µmol), the mixture was stirred at 60°C for 4 hours and at 80°C for 1 hour. Saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate was added thereto, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 140 (60 mg, 58% yield) as a yellow oily material.
