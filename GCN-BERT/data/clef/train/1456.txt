Third Step: Synthesis of Compound (T-5)
Under a nitrogen atmosphere, compound (T-2) (16.0 g), compound (T-4) (52.9g) and THF (tetrahydrofuran) (640 mL) were put in a reaction vessel, and the resulting mixture was cooled down to −70° C. Thereto, lithium diisopropylamide (LDA; 1.01 M; THF solution; 258 mL) was slowly added, and stirred for 1 hour while maintaining at −70° C. Next, copper(II) chloride (39.0 g) was slowly added, and stirred for 45 minutes while maintaining at −70° C. Next, nitrobenzene (29.8 mL) was slowly added, and stirred for 12 hours while returning to room temperature. The resulting reaction mixture was poured into a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride, and an aqueous layer was subjected to extraction with ethyl acetate. Combined organic layers were washed with water, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (heptane/ethyl acetate=10/1 in a volume ratio) to obtain compound (T-5) (13.1 g, yield: 39%).
