Synthesis Example 3
Synthesis of Compound 34
1.96 g (2.30 mmol, yield=65%) of Compound 34 was synthesized in the same manner as in Synthesis Example 1, except that 2.29 g (7.08 mmol) of 4-(diphenylamino)-1-naphthaldehyde was used instead of 1.64 g (7.08 mmol) of 4-phenyl-1-naphthaldehyde, and Intermediate 3-(4-(diphenylamino)naphthalen-1-yl)-4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one was used instead of Intermediate 4-hydroxy-3-(4-phenylnaphthalen-1-yl)pent-3-en-2-one.
