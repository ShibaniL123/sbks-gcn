Step 3
2-(4,6-Dimethylpyridin-2-yl)ethyl methanesulfonate
2-(4,6-Dimethylpyridin-2-yl)ethanol (421 mg, 3.07 mmol) and triethylamine (1.18 g, 11.6 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL), methanesulfonyl chloride (794 mg, 6.94 mmol) was added at 0Â°C. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, diluted with dichloromethane (20 mL), washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (30 mL x 2), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and purified by silica gel column chromatography (4:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.5) to give 2-(4,6-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)ethyl methanesulfonate (400 mg, as a colorless oil) with a yield of 61%.
