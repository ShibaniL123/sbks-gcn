Step 7: preparation of intermediate ethyl 2,2-difluoro-2-[(3-oxazol-2-yl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-6-yl)oxy]-acetate (7g)
3-oxazol-2-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (7f) (122 mg, 0.59 mmol) was solubilized in DMF (6.5 mL) at -20 °C with DBU (97 µL, 0.65 mmol) and ethyl 2-bromo-2,2-difluoro-acetate (340 µL, 2.65 mmol). The reaction was stirred for 1h15 at -20°C. H2O was added and the mixture was extracted twice with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (petroleum ether/acetone 100/0 to 70/30) to provide ethyl 2,2-difluoro-2-[(3-oxazol-2-yl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-6-yl)oxy]-acetate (7g) (121 mg, 0.37 mmol, 63.5%).
