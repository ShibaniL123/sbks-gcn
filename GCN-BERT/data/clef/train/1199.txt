Step 1: To a solution of tert-butyl 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (1.00 g, 4.36 mmol) as intermediate of formula (iv) and triethylamine (1.00 ml, 8.00 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (20 ml) at 0°C was added drop wise methanesulfonyl chloride (0.41 ml, 5.24 mmol). After being stirred at 0°C for 1 h and at rt overnight, the reaction mixture was washed with water (2 x 10 ml) and brine (10 ml), dried over MgSO4 filtered and concentrated to afford an intermediate of formula (vi) tert-butyl 4-(2- methylsulfonyloxy-ethyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate as a pale yellow solid (1.25 g, 93%).
