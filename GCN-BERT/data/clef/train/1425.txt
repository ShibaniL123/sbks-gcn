Step 2
7-fluorobenzofuran-3 (2H)-one
The crude 3-fluoro-2-methoxybenzoyl chloride 84b (1.86 g, 8.8 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL of ether, then 10 mL of a solution of 2 M (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane in n-hexane was added dropwise in an ice bath. The reaction solution was then stirred for 3 hours at room temperature, then concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. 20 mL of acetic acid was added in an ice bath, and reaction was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, then water was added. The reaction solution was extracted by ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with saturated sodium carbonate solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound 7-fluorobenzofuran-3(2H)-one 84c (340 mg, yield 27%) as a yellow solid.
