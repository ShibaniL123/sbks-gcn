7-Methyl-5-(2-methyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)indolin-2-one
Step A: 3-Bromo-2-methyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine. To a solution of 2-methyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine (Intermediate 16, 130 mg, 0.65 mmol) in AcOH (3 mL) was added bromine (89 μL, 1.7 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 70° C. for 2 h. To the reaction mixture was added additional bromine (15 μL, 0.3 mmol) and stirring was maintained for 18 h. The reaction mixture was poured into ice water (15 mL). The precipitate was collected and washed with water (3×2 mL) and with n-hexane (1×300 μL) to give the title compound (110 mg, 60% yield) as an off-white crystalline solid.
