Step 3. 2-Bromo-1-fluoro-3-methyl-5-vinylbenzene
To a solution of 2-bromo-1-fluoro-5-iodo-3-methylbenzene (10.3 g, 32.8 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (80 mL) and water (13.3 mL) was added 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-vinyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (Aldrich, 6.16 mL, 34.5 mmol), [1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]-dichloropalladium(II) (Pd(dppf)Cl2) (2.40 g, 3.3 mmol), and potassium phosphate tribasic (13.9 g, 65.7 mmol). The reaction mixture was degassed by bubbling nitrogen through the mixture for 10 minutes and then heated to 70° C. for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature the reaction mixture was filtered over a pad of Celite, diluted with water, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (5.46 g, 77%).
