Step 11: ([1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](2H2)methyl) [(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)methyl]amine
To a solution of [1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](2H2)methanamine [Example 2, Step 10] (1 g, 3.44 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in toluene (10 mL) was added 5-methylpyridine-2-carbaldehyde (417 mg, 3.44 mmol, 1.00 equiv). The resulting solution was stirred for 2 h at 100° C. The resulting mixture was concentrated under vacuum to remove toluene. The residue was taken up in methanol (10 mL) and cooled to 0° C., and NaBH4 (261.44 mg, 6.88 mmol, 2.00 equiv) was added in several portions. The resulting solution was stirred overnight at 25° C. The resulting mixture was concentrated under vacuum to remove methanol. The resulting solution was diluted with ethyl acetate (25 mL). The organic layers were washed with water (3×10 mL) and brine (3×10 mL). The mixture was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by Prep-HPLC with the following conditions: Column,)(Bridge Prep OBD C18 Column 5 um, 30×150 mm; mobile phase, Water (10 mmol/L NH4HCO3) and ACN (32% ACN up to 48% in 7 min); Detector, UV 254/220 nm to afford 120 mg (9%) of ([1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](d2)methyl)[(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)methyl]amine as a white solid.
