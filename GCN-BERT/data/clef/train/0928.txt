Synthesis of Compound 45
Methyl-1,2,3,4-tetra-O-acetyl-Î²-D-glucuronate (1.5 g, 4.50 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL of DCM, and hydrogen bromide (2.34 mL, 3.0 eq.) was added thereto in an ice bath. After the dropwise addition, the ice bath was removed, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. After the completion of reaction, H2O was added, and the mixture was subjected to extraction with CHCl3. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried by adding anhydrous sodium sulfate, and then distilled under reduced pressure. Then, the residue was purified by column chromatography (hexane:EtOAc=4:1) to isolate and obtain a compound 45 (0.22 g, 14%) as a white crystal.
