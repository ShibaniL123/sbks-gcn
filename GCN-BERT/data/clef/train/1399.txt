Example 46
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol) and 4-methyl-2-(oxolan-3-yl)-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.096 g, 0.448 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.832 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.85 mL, 1.432 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50Â° C. for 5 days and the precipitation formed. After cooling, the precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with cold 1:1 acetonitrile/water to give 4-methyl-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-2-(tetrahydrofuran-3-yl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.114 g, 63%) as a light brown solid.
