Example 36
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminooxazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.040 g, 0.175 mmol) and 2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.030 g, 0.192 mmol), and pyridine (0.06 mL, 0.785 mmol) in acetonitrile (2 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.36 mL, 0.612 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50° C. for 5 days and the precipitation formed. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (10 mL) and extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (2×25 mL) followed by washing once with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by pre-TLC with 95:5 dichloromethane/methanol mixture to give 2,4-dimethyl-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)oxazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.056 g, 87%) as a light brown solid.
