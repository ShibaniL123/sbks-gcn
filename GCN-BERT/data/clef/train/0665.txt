Preparation Example 6-3 : Preparation of tert-butyl 4-acetylpiperidine-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl-4-(methoxy(methyl)carbamoyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (2.29 g, 8.32 mmol) was dissolved in 30 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and the resulting solution was cooled to -78 °C. To the solution was slowly added methylmagnesium bromide (3.0 M) (7.73 ml, 10.82 mmol) and the solution was stirred at 0 °C for 1 hr. After completion of the reaction by 2 N hydrochloric acid aqueous solution, 6 N sodium hydroxide solution was added to adjust pH to 10 and then the solution was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was treated with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and filtered and the solution was concentrated. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol = 10/1) to give the white title compound (6.36 g, 94.0 %).
