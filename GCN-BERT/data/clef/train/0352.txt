Step 3: (R)-4-(2-((2-(8-(Benzyloxy)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl)phenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate
A cooled solution of (R)-tert-butyl (2-(8-(benzyloxy)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)(4-hydroxyphenethyl)carbamate (6.3 g, 9.78 mmol) in DCM (100 mL) at 0° C. was added with triethylamine (2.72 mL, 19.56 mmol) followed by 2-[N,N-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amino]-5-chloropyridine (4.21 g, 10.76 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 2 hours. The coolant was removed and 2M aqueous sodium hydroxide (25 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes. The organic phase was separated, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the title compound (7.3 g, 96%).
