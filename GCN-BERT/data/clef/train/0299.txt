Example 48. 3-((3-(((7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)oxy)methyl)piperidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile
32.4 mg of 4-(piperidine-3-ylmethoxy)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine was added to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask, and then dissolved with 1.00 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 30.2 mg of 3-cyanobenzenesulfonyl chloride was added into the solution, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0250 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and then stirred at room temperature for about 1 hour. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=0.100→1:80→1:50). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 30.1 mg of 3-((3-(((7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)oxy)methyl)piperidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile was obtained with a yield of about 54.0%.
