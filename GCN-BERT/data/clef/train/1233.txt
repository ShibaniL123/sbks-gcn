(2) Preparation of (2R,5R)-2-((2-methyl-2-azaspiro[3,3]heptan-6-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3,2,1]octan-6 -yl hydrogen sulfate
(2R,5R)-2-((2-azaspiro[3,3]heptan-6-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3,2,1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate (50 mg, 0.139 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture solvent of water (50 mL) and methanol (3 mL), then to the system was added an aqueous solution of formaldehyde (0.5 mL, 37%), Pd/C (20 mg), purged with hydrogen at 25Â°C for 16h, distilled to remove methanol, the residue was purified with reverse phase silica gel column chromatography (acetonitrile / water = 0%-20%) to obtain the title compound (9 mg, yield 17.3%).
