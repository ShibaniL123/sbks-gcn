(39-5) Synthesis of (S)-4-Chloro-N-(2-hydroxy-1-{3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl}ethyl)benzamide (Compound 39)
To a stirred solution of N-[(1S)-2-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-{3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl}ethyl]-4-chlorobenzamide (109 mg, 0.2 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (3.4 mL) was added 1 mol/L solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran (600 ÂµL), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. After terminating the reaction by the addition of water to the mixture, the whole was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined extract was washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography eluting with hexane-ethyl acetate and by recrystallization to obtain the title compound (32 mg, yield 38%).
