Preparation Example 3: Preparation of tert-butyl 6-(1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptane-2-carboxylate
Under nitrogen gas protection, tert-butyl 6-hydroxyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptane-2-carboxylate (4.0 g, 18.8 mmol), phthalimide (3.86 g, 26.2 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (5.92 g, 22.6 mmol) were added to tetrahydrofuran (100 mL), cooled to 0°C, diethyl azodicarboxylate (3.93 g, 22.6 mmol) was slowly added dropwise. After addition, the reaction solution was heated to 25°C and stirred for 16 h. After complete reaction as measured by LC-MS, water (1 mL) was added to quench the reaction, concentration was performed by removing solvent under reduced pressure, water (150 mL) and ethyl acetate (150 mL) were added, the phases were separated, the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL ×2), and the organic phases were combined, concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate = 10:1) to obtain the title compound in white color (6.0 g, yield 93.3 %).
