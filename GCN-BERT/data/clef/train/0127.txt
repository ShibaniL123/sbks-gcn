Step 9: 2-([1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](d2)methyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione
To a solution of [1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](d2)methyl 4-methylbenzene-1-sulfonate [Example 2, Step 8] (7 g, 15.68 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in N,N-dimethylformamide (100 mL) was added 2-potassio-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione (3.78 g, 20.44 mmol, 1.30 equiv). The resulting solution was stirred for 7 h at 150° C. The reaction mixture was cooled to 25° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of water. The resulting solution was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL). The organic layers were washed with water (3×100 mL) and brine (3×100 mL). The mixture was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was applied onto a silica gel column with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:1) to afford 6.1 g (92%) of 2-([1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](d2)methyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione as a light yellow solid.
