Example 3-5 : Preparation of 1,1'-(5-methoxypyridin-2,4-diyl)diethanone (XX)
1-(2-Bromo-5-methoxypyridin-4-yl)ethanone (XIX) (260 mg, 1.13 mmol), palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) (10.15 mg, 45.20 µmole), and 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (DPPP) (37.29 mg, 90.41 µmole) were dissolved in 1.0 mL of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim] [BF4]), and butyl vinyl ether (731.23 µL, 5.65 mmole) and triethylamine (TEA) (252.03 µL, 1.81 mmole) were slowly added thereto. The resulting solution was stirred 125 °C for 24 hrs and then cooled to room temperature. 2N hydrochloric acid (HCl) was slowly added dropwise to the solution to adjust pH to 1∼2 and the solution was stirred for 30 min and neutralized. The solution was diluted with dichloromethane and washed with water. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-Hex/EA = 3/1) to give the title compound (54 mg, 25 %).
