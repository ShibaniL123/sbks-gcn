(11) Preparation of (2S,5R)-2-(3,9-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-ylcarbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate
Tetra(n-butyl)ammonium (2S,5R)-2-((3,9-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,9-diazabicyclo[3.3.1] nonan-7-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl sulfate (195 mg, 0.235 mmol) was added to dichloromethane (2 mL), cooled to 0°C, trifluoroacetic acid (2 mL) was added, reacted at 0°C for 1h, concentrated in vacuum to remove solvent, acetonitrile (10 mL) was added and shaken with ultrasonic to generate precipitate, suck filtrated, the resultant solid was dried in vacuum to obtain the title compound (64 mg, yield 70%).
