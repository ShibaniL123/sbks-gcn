Synthesis of 4-(5-phenyldibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinin-6(5)-yl)phenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate
To 6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-phenyl-5,6-dihydrodibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine (1.2 g, 3.3 mmol) in DCM (15 mL) at 0° C. was added BBr3 (15.1 mL, 1M solution in DCM, 15.1 mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 hours. Water was added, and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (×2). The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated to give 4-(5-benyldibenzo[c,e][1,2]-azaborinin-6(5H-yl)phenol (1.1 g, 78% yield) as a white solid. The product was used in the next step without further purification.
