Step 6. Preparation of 3-Acetyl-8-chloro-2-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one
8-Chloro-3-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one (6g, 0.02mol) and 60ml of DMSO were added to a 100ml three-necked flask and stirred to be dissolved. IBX (8.4g, 0.03mol) was then added; temperature was raised to 35Â°C and mixture was stirred for 5h. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. The reaction was stopped, 300ml of ethyl acetate was added, temperature was raised and reaction was carried out under reflux for 15min. Suction filtration was performed while the mixture was hot. The solid was washed with hot ethyl acetate 3 times, filtrates were combined and 200ml water was added. After stratification, aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layers were combined, washed with saturated salt water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 5.4g of a light yellow solid with a yield of 90.2%.
