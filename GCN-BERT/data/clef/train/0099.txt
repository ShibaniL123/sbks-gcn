Methyl-d3 (R)-o-chloromandelate
9.4 g of (R)-o-chloromandelic acid was dissolved in 36 mL of deuterated methanol, into which 1 mL of HCl/dioxane solution (4 M) was added, reflux heated for 5 hours, and the solvent was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure after cooling. The residue was dissolved with methylene chloride, and the resultant solution was washed sequentially with 5% aqueous potassium carbonate solution and water, and the methylene chloride solution was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removing the desiccant by filtration, the solution was evaporated to dryness to obtain 9.2 g of colorless transparent oily product methyl-d3 (R)-o-chloromandelate, with a yield of 89.7%.
