Example 25. Preparation of Comparative PAG, CPAG-2
A 100 mL flask was charged with (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (Sigma-Aldrich) (3.22 g, 10.0 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and CH3CN (25 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at room temperature. A CH3CN (25 mL) solution of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (3.00 g, 20.0 mmol, 2.0 eq.) and H2O (0.36 g, 20.0 mmol, 2.0 eq.) was added dropwise to the mixture over 5 minutes and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. 4-Methoxyacetophenone (1.50 g, 10.0 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added to the mixture and the mixture was stirred for 3.5 hours at room temperature. The mixture was concentrated in an evaporator. The residue was extracted with hexane (100 mL) twice and the hexane layers were combined. The combined hexane solution was concentrated in an evaporator. The crude product was purified by recrystallization (hexane/CHCl3, 50° C. to 0° C.) to obtain the target compound as white solid (0.096 g) in 3.2% yield.
