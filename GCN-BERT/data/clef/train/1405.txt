Example 34
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol), 2-chloropyrimidine (0.047 g, 0.408 mmol), 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethyl-xanthene (0.045 g, 0.077 mmol), and potasium carbonate (0.197 g, 1.432 mmol) in anhydrous dioxane (4 mL) bubbling with argon in a sealed tube was added palladium(II) acetate (0.017 g, 0.073 mmol). The solution mixture was under continuous argon bubbling for additional 10 min. The sealed tube was then heated at 80Â° C. overnight (15 h). After cooling, the precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with cold tetrahydrofuran followed by water to give 6-(2-(pyrimidin-2-ylamino)thiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.126 g, 95%) as a brown solid.
