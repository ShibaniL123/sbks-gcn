Example 1. Preparation of SM-1: 1,1-difluoro-2-oxo-2-(phenylamino)ethane-1-sulfonyl fluoride
A 100 mL flask was charged with CH2Cl2 (10 mL) under nitrogen stream at 0° C. 2-(Fluorosulfonyl)difluoroacetyl fluoride (4.00 g, 22.6 mmol, 1.2 eq.) was added and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at 0° C. A solution containing CH2Cl2 (8 mL), aniline (1.71 g, 18.4 mmol, 1.0 eq.), and pyridine (1.45 g, 18.4 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added dropwise to the mixture over 10 minutes and subsequently the mixture was stirred for an hour at 0° C. In addition, the mixture was allowed to warm to RT and stirred for 4 hours at RT. CH2Cl2 (36 mL) and 1N HCl (18 mL) were added to the final reaction mixture and then the lower layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (18 mL×2) and brine (18 mL×2). The solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtrated and then CH2Cl2 was removed in an evaporator. The target compound was obtained as a pale yellow solid (4.53 g, 97.3% yield).
