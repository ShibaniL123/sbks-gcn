Step 3: Preparation of 3-(dimethylamino)-2-fluoro-1-(4-methoxy-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-yl)prop-2-en-1-one
2.5 g (8.072 mmol) of 1-(4-chloro-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-yl)-2-fluoroethane-1-one prepared in step 2 was dissolved in 50 mL of anhydrous toluene, to which 10.76 mL (80.720 mmol) of N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMF-DMA) was added, followed by stirring at 90Â° C. for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature. Ethyl acetate and water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 3/1,-hexane/ethyl acetate, 1/1) to give 2.1 g of the target compound 3-(dimethylamino)-2-fluoro-1-(4-methoxy-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-yl)prop-2-en-1-one as a yellow liquid (5.827 mmol, yield: 72%).
