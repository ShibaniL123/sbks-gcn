Preparation of 2-cyano-N-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-N-methyl-5-nitrobenzamide (C138)
To a solution of 2-bromo-N-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-N-methyl-5-nitrobenzamide (0.120 g, 0.323 mmol) (C149) in N,N-dimethylformamide (1.6 mL) was added copper(I) cyanide (0.145 g, 1.62 mmol). The reaction mixture was degassed under vacuum, backfilled with nitrogen, capped in a 2-mL microwave vial, and heated at 160° C. for 20 minutes in a Biotage Initiator® microwave reactor with external IR-sensor temperature monitoring from the side of the vessel. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate while stirring vigorously and then filtered through Celite® washing with ethyl acetate. The filtrate was washed with brine. The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. Purification by flash column chromatography using 0-25% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent provided the title compound as a mixture of amide rotamers as a beige solid (0.051 g, 47%):
