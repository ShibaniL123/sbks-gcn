(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-acetamido-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1 -yl)-3,5 -difluorophenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-amino-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 70i (70 mg, 0.16 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of dichloromethane, then acetic anhydride (80 mg, 0.78 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (100 mg, 0.78 mmol) were added. After stirring for 12 hours, the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by CombiFlash flash preparation instrument with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-acetamido-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetr ahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 70j (50 mg, yield 64%) as a yellow solid.
