Example 25: Synthesis of N-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-4-(4-(4-(3-morpholinoprop-1-yn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)butanamide
Step 1: Synthesis of methyl 2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-4-(4-(4-(3-morpholinoprop-1-yn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)butanoate
To a solution of methyl 4-(4-(4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-yn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate (Example 22, Step 1) (500 mg, 1 eq) in dichloromethane (10 ml) was added with Et3N (0.34 ml, 2 eq) and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.19 ml, 2 eq), and the mixture was stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. Morpholine (0.22 ml, 2 eq) was added and stirred for 3 hr at 60Â° C. The mixture was cooled room temperature and extracted with dichloromethane and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (450 mg, 77%).
