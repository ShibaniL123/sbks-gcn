(8) Preparation of di(tert-butyl) 7-amino-3,9-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,9-dicarboxylate
Di(tert-butyl) 7-oxo-3,9-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,9-dicarboxylate (950 mg, 2.79 mmol) was dissolved in ammoniamethanol solution (7 mol/L, 25 mL), tetraisopropyl titanate (3.17 g, 11.16 mmol) was added, stirred at 25Â°C for 16h, sodium borohydride (527 mg, 13.95 mmol) was added. After completion of the reaction as measured by TLC (dichloromethane : methanol =20:1), aqueous ammonia (5 mL) was added, filtrated to remove insoluble substance, the filtrate was concentrated in vacuum, the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane : methanol =20:1) to obtain the title compound (520 mg, yield 54.6%).
