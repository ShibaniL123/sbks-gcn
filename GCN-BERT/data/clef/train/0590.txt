(2R,3R,4S,5R)-2-(acetoxymethyl)-6-hydroxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triyl triacetate (2)
A solution of [(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4,5,6-tetrakis(acetyloxy)oxan-2-yl]methyl acetate (50 g, 128.1 mmol) in THF (150 mL) was treated with acetic acid (8.07 mL, 140.9 mmol) and hydrazine monohydrate (7.05 g, 140.9 mmol). The temperature of reaction mixture was slightly exothermic while addition of hydrazine (24° C. to 33° C.). The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4 h and extracted with ethyl acetate (400 mL). The organic phase was washed with water (300 mL), dried over MgSO4, and concentrated to give crude glucose tetraacetate as a off-white solid (43 g). Purification using a short pad of silica gel gave [(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4,5-tris(acetyloxy)-6-hydroxyoxan-2-yl]methyl acetate yield 33 g (74%). (Note: In a pilot reaction, this was used in the next step without further purification).
