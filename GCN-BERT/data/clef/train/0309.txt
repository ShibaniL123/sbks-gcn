Example 76A
Methyl 4-{[(6-bromo-3-hydroxy-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo [2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
At RT, 447 mg (1.18 mmol) of HATU and 410 ml (2.35 mmol) of DIPEA were added in succession to a solution of 300 mg (0.78 mmol, purity 90%) of the compound from Example 42A in 5 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 30 min. Subsequently, 172 mg (0.78 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, dissolved in DMF, were added and the mixture was stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, the mixture was purified directly (without further work-up) by preparative HPLC (Method 4). This gave 51 mg (12% of theory, purity 97%) of the title compound
