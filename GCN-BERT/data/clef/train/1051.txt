Intermediate 42: 8-Bromo-7-methyl-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
To a microwave vial charged with EtOH (2 mL) were added 3-bromo-4-methylpyridin-2-amine (100 mg, 0.54 mmol) and 2-bromo-1-phenylethan-1-one (213 mg, 1.07 mmol). The vial was capped and heated to 160° C. in the microwave for 60 minutes. After cooling to rt, the reaction was diluted with sat. aq. NaHCO3 and extracted with EtOAc (×3). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-25% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as a light yellow solid (94 mg, 61% yield).
