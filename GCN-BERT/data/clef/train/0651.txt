Step B: 7-Chloro-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a solution of 7-chloro-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-c]pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (109 mg, 0.328 mmol) in DMSO (5.5 mL) was added silver carbonate (25 mg, 0.0907 mmol) and AcOH (3 μL, 0.0524 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 120° C. for 2 h. After cooling to rt, the mixture was diluted with EtOAc (50 mL) and washed successively with water (3×20 mL) and brine (2×20 mL). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 10% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound (53 mg, 56%) as a white crystalline solid.
