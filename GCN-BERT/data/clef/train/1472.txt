Example 61
(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(6-(1-met hyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl) acrylic acid
Step 1
5-bromo-2-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridine
(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)boronic acid 61a (0.1 g, 0.794 mmol) was dissolved in 5.5 mL of a mixture of 1,4-dioxane and water (V/V=10:1), then 2,5-dibromopyridine 61b (0.188 g, 0.784 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (92 mg, 0.796 mmol) and sodium carbonate (0.168 g, 1.585 mmol) were added. The mixture wasarmed up to 85Â°C and stirred for 12 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 20 mL of ethyl acetate was added. The reaction mixture was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound 5-bromo-2-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridine 61c (0.13 g, yield 68%) as a white solid.
