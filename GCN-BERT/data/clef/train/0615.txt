Step 2
N-(1-(3-(benzyloxy)-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-yl)-2-methylpropan-1-amine
1-(3-(benzyloxy)-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-one 92a (5 g, 0.019 mol) was dissolved in 100 mL of dichloroethane, then 2-methylpropan-1-amine (2.2 g, 0.029 mol) and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (8g, 0.038mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 48 hours at room temperature, then added with water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound N-(1-(3-(benzyloxy)-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-yl)-2-methylpropan-1-amine 92b (5.2 g, yield 85%) as a light yellow oil.
