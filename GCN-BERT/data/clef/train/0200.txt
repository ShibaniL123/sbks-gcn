N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine
1-Fluoro-3-iodopropane (40.9 μL, 0.39 mmol) was added to a solution of N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)azetidin-3-amine (169 mg, 0.39 mmol) and DIPEA (203 μL, 1.16 mmol) in NMP (1.7 mL) at room temperature. After 18 hours, the reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by reverse phase flash chromatography (C18), eluting with decreasingly polar mixtures of water (containing 0.2% ammonium hydroxide) and MeCN as eluents. Product fractions were combined and lyopholized to afford N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (75 mg, 39%) as clear residue.
