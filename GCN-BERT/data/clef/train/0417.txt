Intermediate 74: 5-Chloro-2-cyclopropyl-8-methyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Step A: 2-Cyclopropyl-6-iodo-8-methyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a solution of 1,2-diamino-5-iodo-3-methylpyridin-1-ium2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 12) (725 mg, 1.61 mmol) in DMF (6.0 mL) was added cyclopropanecarbaldehyde (0.48 ml, 6.4 mmol) followed by sodium metabisulfite (614 mg, 3.2 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 90° C. for 2h. The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with water, and extracted with EtOAc (2×). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine; dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by flash chromatography (SiO2; 0-100% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as a white solid (277.6 mg, 58% yield).
