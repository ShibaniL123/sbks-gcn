Step 11: preparation of intermediate 10-Allyloxy-5-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-ene-4,9-dione (3k)
To a solution of tert-butyl 7-(allyloxyamino)-3-[2-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxyethyl]-2-oxo-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3j) (4.29 g, 8.83 mmol) in DCM (88.3 mL) were added TEA (2.46 mL, 17.7 mmol) and diphosgene (1.58 mL, 11.48 mmol). After 5 min, the solution was washed with brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The yellow oil obtained was stirred with 4M HCl solution in dioxane (88.3 mL) during 1 h. The mixture was concentrated in vacuo and to the crude in DCM (88.4 mL) was dropwise added TEA (2.25 mL, 17.67 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 30 min then diluted with DCM and washed with water. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (DCM/MeOH 100/0 to 90/10) to afford 10-allyloxy-5-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-ene-4,9-dione (3k) (1.72 g, 5.78 mmol, 66%).
