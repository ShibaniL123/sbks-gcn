Example 19. Preparation of PAG-9
A 100 mL flask was charged with 1, 1-Difluoro-2-oxo-2-(1-adamntylamino)ethanesulfonyl fluoride (SM-2) (1.49 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-Hydroxy-2'-methoxyacetophenone (SM-7) (0.80 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (24 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −50° C. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 3.0 mL, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added drop wise to the mixture over 10 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at −50° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (24 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then AcOEt (72 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (24 mL) and brine (24 mL). The solution was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and then hexane (100 mL) was added to the residue and the mixture was stirred for 2.5 hours at room temperature. The solid formed was filtrated and washed with hexane (50 mL). This solid was mostly soluble in CH2Cl2 (100 mL) and the remaining insoluble solid was filtrated off and then the filtrate was concentrated. The obtained crude product was purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt) and recrystallization (hexane/CHCl3, 50° C. to 0° C.) to obtain the target PAG as white solid (0.99 g) in 45.2% yield.
