Preparation of trans-(3-(2,2-dichloro-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)cyclopropyl)phenyl)pentafluoro-λ6-sulfane (C44)
To a round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar were added (E)-pentafluoro(3-(4-methoxystyryl)phenyl)-λ6-sulfane (C57) (4.13 g, 0.0123 mol) and benzyl triethylammonium chloride (0.6 g, 0.00264 mol). Chloroform (150 mL) was added followed by an ice-cold aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (20 g, 0.5 mol) dissolved in water (34 mL). The biphasic mixture was stirred at 40° C. 16 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to 23° C., water (100 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with chloroform (2×50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by flash chromatography using 0-15% ethyl acetate/hexane as eluent gave the title compound as a (3.8 g, 75%):
