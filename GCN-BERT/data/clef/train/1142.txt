[Reaction Scheme 3-4] Synthesis of Intermediate 3-d]
In a 1-L reactor, Intermediate 3-c (25 g, 87.9 mmol) and chloroform (250 ml) were placed and stirred together. At room temperature, bromine drops were slowly added, followed by stirring for 2 hours. Methanol was used to form precipitates which were then filtered to afford Intermediate 3-d (26.1 g): (yield 82%)
