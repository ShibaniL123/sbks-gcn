Preparation of trans-1,3-dichloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)cyclopropyl)benzene (C48)
Aqueous sodium hydroxide (50%, 6.8 mL, 130 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of (E)-1,3-dichloro-5-(4-methoxystyryl)benzene (C61) (2.4 g, 8.6 mmol) and N-benzyl-N,N-diethylethanaminium chloride (0.20 g, 0.86 mmol) in chloroform (14 mL, 170 mmol) at 23° C. The resulting biphasic, dark brown mixture was vigorously stirred at 23° C. for 24 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (200 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (2×100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to afford the title product as a brown oil (2.8 g, 90%):
