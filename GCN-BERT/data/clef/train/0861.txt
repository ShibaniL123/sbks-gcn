Intermediate 7: 6-(4,4,5,5-Tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-3-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)benzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one
Step A: 6-Bromo-3-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)benzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one. To a cooled (0° C.) solution of 6-bromobenzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one (1.0 g, 4.4 mmol) in THF (8.0 mL) was added 60 wt % sodium hydride in mineral oil (208 mg, 5.2 mmol) portionwise. Stirring was maintained at 0° C. for 20 minutes, and (2-(chloromethoxy)ethyl) trimethylsilane (0.77 ml, 4.4 mmol) was then added dropwise over a period of 10 minutes. The mixture was warmed to rt and stirred for 2 h. The crude mixture was diluted with water and extracted with DCM (×2). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as a white solid (1.2 g, 76%).
