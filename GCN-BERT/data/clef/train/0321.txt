3-(2-Methoxypropyl)-5-methyl-6-[(5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]-1-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (racemate)
340 mg (0.626 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 486A were dissolved in a mixture of 17 ml each of methanol and trimethyl orthoformate, and 626 μl (2.51 mmol) of a 4 M solution of hydrogen chloride in dioxane were added at RT. After about 16 h of reaction time, a further 626 μl (2.51 mmol) of the 4 M solution of hydrogen chloride and dioxane were added and, after a further 2 h, the same amount again. After a total reaction time of about 24 h, the reaction mixture was admixed with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic extract was concentrated and the remaining residue was purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8). After concentration of the product fractions and drying under high vacuum, 222 mg (79% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
