(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-7-fluoro-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
2-(benzyloxy)-1-fluoro-4-(2-nitroprop-1-en-1-yl)benzene
2-(3-(benzyloxy)-4-fluorophenyl)acetaldehyde 16a (4 g, 0.017 mmol, prepared by a well-known method disclosed in "Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 9(3), 2001, 677-694") and ammonium acetate (1.6 g, 0.021 mol) were mixed with 30 mL of nitroethane. The resulting mixture was warmed up to 90Â°C and stirred for 12 hours. The reaction was stopped and cooled to room temperature. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound 2-(benzyloxy)-1-fluoro-4-(2-nitroprop-1-en-1-yl)benzene 16b (3.5 g, yield 70%) as a yellow oil.
