EXAMPLE H:
General synthesis of N,N'-diaryl-1 ,2-benzenediamine
To 660 mL of degassed toluene are added 1.06 g (4.75 mmol) of Pd(OAc)2 and 14.46 mL (14.46 mmol) of tri-tert-butylphosphine (1M solution in toluene), and the mixture is stirred for 5 min. Then 240 mmol of the 1,2-dibromobenzene derivative, 505 mmol of the arylamine and 67.22 g (700 mmol) of sodium tert-butoxide are added to the solution, which is then degassed and stirred at 140Â° C. under a protective gas atmosphere for 10 h. After cooling, 600 mL of NH4Cl solution and 150 mL of ethyl acetate are added to the solution, and the phases are separated, washed with water, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated. The solids are dissolved in toluene and the mixture is filtered through Celite. The crude product is stirred with hot heptane.
EXAMPLE H1: Synthesis of N,N'-bis(biphenyl-4-yl)-1,2-benzenediamine
The synthesis is effected by the general method of example h from 56.6 g (240 mmol) of 1,2-dibromobenzene and 85.4 g (505 mmol) of 4-aminobiphenyl. The precipitated solids are recrystallized from toluene/acetonitrile (5:1) and the residue is washed with MeOH. This gives 78 g (189 mmol) of a crystalline solid. The overall yield is 80%.
