Example 14. Preparation of PAG-4
A 100 mL flask was charged with 1,1-difluoro-2-oxo-2-(phenylamino)ethane-1-sulfonyl fluoride (SM-1) (1.22 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-Hydroxy-2'-methylacetophenone (SM-6) (0.79 g, 5.38 mmol, 1.1 eq.) and THF (24 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −30° C. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 3.0 mL, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added dropwise to the mixture over 5 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 2.5 hours at −30° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (24 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then AcOEt (72 mL) was added. An upper layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (24 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (24 mL) and brine (24 mL). The solution was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and then hexane (100 mL) was added to the crude and a mixture was stirred for 20 minute at room temperature and the hexane was removed by decantation. This procedure was repeated two more times. CH2Cl2 (70 mL) was added to the remaining material and the sodium salt separated was removed by filtration and the filtrate was concentrated in an evaporator. The obtained crude product was purified by recrystallization (hexane/CHCl3, 60° C. to 0° C.) to obtain the target PAG as white solid (0.45 g) in 24.3% yield.
