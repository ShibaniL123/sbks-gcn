2.5: 5-bromo-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione
0.2 ml (1.2 mmol) of diisopropyl azodicarboxylate is added to a solution of 100 mg (0.5 mmol) of 5-bromo-3-methyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione, 140 mg (0.5 mmol) of 3-[1-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-piperidin-4-yl]-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinazolin-2-one and 321 mg (1.2 mmol) of triphenylphosphine in 10 ml of tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. 15 ml of diethyl ether is added; the suspension is stirred for 10 minutes and then filtered. The solid obtained is rinsed once with diethyl ether and then dried in the stove under vacuum for 3 hours. 160 mg (74%) of 5-bromo-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid.
