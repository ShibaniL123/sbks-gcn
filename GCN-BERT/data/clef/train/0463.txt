Synthesis of ethyl 3-ethoxy-4-formylbenzoate
A solution of 4-formyl-3-hydroxybenzoic acid (1.0 g, 6.02 mmol) in DMF (20 mL) was added with potassium carbonate (2.49 g, 18.1 mmol) and ethyl iodide (2.82 g, 18.1 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 72 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated at reduced pressure and the residue partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic extract was washed with brine (Ã—2), poured through a hydrophobic frit and the solvent evaporated at reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% i-hexane to 4:1 i-hexane/ethyl acetate) to afford the title compound (1.41 g, 100%).
