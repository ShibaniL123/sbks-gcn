Synthesis of Compound 13
To a mixture of compound 12 (0.45 g, 4.2 mol) and Et3N (8 mL, 0.06 mol) in THF (15 mL), a solution of 2-(tert-Butoxycarbonyloxyimino)-2-phenylacetonitrile (2.1 g, 8.3 mol) in THF (30 mL) was added dropwise at 0Â° C. Following complete addition, the solution was allowed to warm to room temperature and left to stir for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated to oil under reduced pressure and CH2Cl2 (50 mL) was added. The mixture was washed with sodium hydroxide (5%, 30 mL) and brine (30 mL). The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, MeOH:CH2Cl2=1:10, v/v) to give compound 13 as a yellow oil (803.1 mg, 60.7%). LC-MS m/z (ES+), 304.22 (M+H)+.
