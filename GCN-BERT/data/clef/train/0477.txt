Step B
Synthesis of 2-[(2 S)-2-{[(2S)-1-[(2S)-2,5-diazaniumylhexanoyl]pyrrolidin-2-yl]formamido}-2-phenylethyl]pyridin-1-ium trichloride
tert-Butyl (S)-6-oxo-6-((S)-2-((S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylcarbamoyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)hexane-1,5-diyldicarbamate (80 mg, 0.13 mmol) was dissolved in a 4 M HCl solution in 1,4-dioxane (1.6 mL, 6.4 mmol). The reaction was stirred at rt for 18 hours. The volatiles were removed under vacuum and the product was triturated in MTBE. The solid was recovered by filtration on a BÃ¼chner funnel, washed with MTBE and dried under vacuum. The solid was dissolved in water and freeze dried to afford 60 mg (88%) of the title compound
