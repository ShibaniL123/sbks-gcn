Selenium dioxide (50 mg, 0.241 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (0.09 ml, 0.482 mmol) was added dropwise thereto, then the mixture was cooled to 0 Â°C, acetic acid (0.002 ml, 0.0241 mmol) was added. After about 30 minutes, the selenium dioxide was completely dissolved, followed by addition of the solution of the compound 2-3 in dichloromethane. The mixture was elevated to room temperature and stirred for 36 hours. When the raw materials were almost exhausted, the resultant was diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with 10% potassium hydroxide aqueous solution, washed with brine, dried and concentrated. The resultant was isolated by column chromatography (dichloromethane:methanol (v/v) = 50:1) to give compound 2-4 as a light yellow oil product (8 mg, 14.87%).
