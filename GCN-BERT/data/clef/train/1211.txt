1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-α-[N-(t-butoxycarbonylmethyl)-N-methylcarbamoyl]benzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-[N-((R)-α-carboxybenzyl) carbamoylmethoxy]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Example 25; 50 mg, 0.078 mmol) and tert-butyl N-methylglycinate (15 mg, 0.10 mmol) were dissolved in DCM (2ml) and N-methylmorpholine (17.2µl, 0.156 mmol) and TBTU (45 mg, 0.14 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was put directly on an Isolute column (2g, silica). The product was eluted with a stepwise gradient using DCM:EtOAc 100:0,95:5,90:10 then 80:20 to give the title compound (30 mg, 50%). M/z 767.4.
