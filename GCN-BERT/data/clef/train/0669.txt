Step C: 2-(Difluoromethyl)-8-methyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a cooled (−78° C.) solution of 2-(difluoromethyl)-6-iodo-8-methyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (150 mg, 0.59 mmol) in THF (4.5 mL) was added n-butyllithium (1.6M/hexanes, 0.44 mL, 0.717 mmol) dropwise over a period of 10 minutes. Stirring was maintained at −78° C. for 30 minutes, and then a solution of hexachloroethane (169 mg, 0.717 mmol) in THF (1.8 mL) was added dropwise over a period of 10 minutes. After the addition, the mixture was warmed to rt and stirred for another 10 minutes. The reaction was quenched with saturated aq. NH4Cl and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as a white solid (71.4 mg, 42%).
