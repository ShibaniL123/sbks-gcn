Step 2
[4-(3-Methylisoxazol-5)-phenyl]-methanol
Ethyl 4-(3-methylisoxazole-5)-benzoate (100 mg, 0.430 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (2 mL). Lithium aluminum hydride (33.0 mg, 0.860 mmol) was added at 0°C, the temperature was warmed to 25°C and stirred for 1 hour. The reaction was quenched with water (10 mL), extracted with ethyl acetate (10 mL x 3), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by preparative TLC plate (3:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.4) to give [4-(3-methylisoxazol-5) -phenyl]-methanol (70.0 mg, as a yellow solid) with a yield of 86%. MS-ESI [M + H]+ calcd. 190, found 190.
