(45-1) Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carbonitrile (Compound 45-1)
To a stirred solution of 1-(4-chloropnenyl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxamide (200 mg) in dehydrated dichloromethane (10 mL) was added Burgess reagent (260 mg), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. After completion of the reaction, water (30 mL) was added to the mixture to stop the reaction, and the whole was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL Ã— 2). The combined organic layer was washed with saturated brine (30 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography eluting with hexane-ethyl acetate to obtain the title compound (200 mg, yield 99%).
