Step 1-2, preparation of 6-bromo-7-chloro-3-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-cinnolin-4-ol: To a suspension of 1-(2-amino-5-bromo-4-chloro-phenyl)-2-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-ethanone (1.7 g, 4.8 mmol) in 5N-HCl (20 mL) under ice cooling was slowly added NaNO2 (510 mg, 7.3 mmol) in H2O (3 mL). The reaction was stirred for 1.5 h at 85° C., and cooled to room temperature. The solid ppts were filtered, and the filtered solid was triturated in MeOH to produce fine solid powder. The solid product was filtered again, washed with MeOH, and dried to afford the title compound (1.1 g, 64%). MS (M+H)−=367.0.
