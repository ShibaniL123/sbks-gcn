Synthesis of 6-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole (27 mg, 79 µmol) prepared according the method described in WO2013/035833 for the compound 297 (Example 228), 6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridine-2-carboxylic acid (18 mg, 0.16 mmol), triethylamine (50 µL, 0.36 mmol), and HATU (70 mg, 0.18 mmol) were reacted. To the reaction solution, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, and then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was suspended in 6% aqueous ammonia, then the suspension was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was subjected to column chromatography (aminosilica gel, 8 g) using methanol and chloroform (concentration gradient, 0 to 20%) as the elution solvent. The obtained compound was dissolved in methanol, and powdered by adding tert-butyl methyl ether to the solution to obtain the title compound (24 mg, 67%) as white solid.
