Step B: Methyl 3-bromo-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-indazole-6-carboxylate
Methyl 1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-indazole-6-carboxylate (2.7075 g, 10.17 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (102 ml) at 25 Â°C under Ar. Bromine (1.886 ml, 36.60 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 60 h. The reaction was stopped, quenched by addition of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (40 mL), and the mixture extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 35 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (1 x 25 mL), dried (sodium sulfate), filtered, and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography (RediSep SiO2, 330 g column) on a CombiFlash Rf purification system eluting with ethyl acetate-hexanes (0-5%). The title compound (2.8006 g, 7.55 mmol, 74.2 % yield) was recovered as a white solid. LC-MS [M+1] = 346.1.
