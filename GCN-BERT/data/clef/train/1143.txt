PAG Synthesis
Example 10. Preparation of PAG-1
A 100 mL flask was charged with 1,1-difluoro-2-oxo-2-(1-adamantylamino)ethanesulfonyl fluoride (SM-2, 1.01 g, 3.30 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-hydroxy-2-trifluoromethylacetophenone (SM-9, 0.64 g, 3.30 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (17 ml) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −50° C. nBuLi (1.6 M, 2.1 mL, 3.30 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added drop-wise to the mixture over 10 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 4.5 hours while warming from −50° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (17 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then AcOEt (51 mL). The upper layer was separated and the lower layer was extracted with AcOEt (34 mL). The organic solutions were combined and washed with 1N HCl (17 mL) and brine (17 mL). The solution was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and the crude product was purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt) to obtain the target PAG as colorless oil to white solid (0.45 g, 27.9% yield).
