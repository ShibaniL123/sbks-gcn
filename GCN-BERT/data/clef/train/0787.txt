(Reference Example 21) Synthesis of 1-isopropyl-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde:
Potassium carbonate (0.863 g, 6.24 mmol) and 2-iodopropane (0.614 mL, 6.24 mmol) were added to a solution of 1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde (0.500 g, 5.20 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (5.2 mL) at room temperature and the reaction liquid was stirred at 60Â°C for 4 hours. The reaction liquid was cooled to room temperature and ethyl acetate and distilled water were added to the reaction liquid. The organic layer was washed with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, n-hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain 1-isopropyl-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde (0.355 g, 2.57 mmol, 49%) as a colorless oil.
