Compound 2B (24.4 g, 41.69 mmol) and 2-(4-bromophenyl)pyridine (19.5 g, 83.37 mmol) were put into 200 ml of tetrahydrofuran under nitrogen atmosphere, and the resulting mixture was stirred and refluxed. Thereafter, potassium carbonate (17.3 g, 125.06 mmol) was dissolved in 80 ml of water, the resulting solution was introduced thereinto, the resulting mixture was sufficiently stirred, and then tetrakistriphenyl-phosphinopalladium (2.9 g, 2.06 mmol) was introduced thereinto. After the reaction for 5 hours, the temperature of the mixture was lowered to normal temperature and filtered. The filtered material was extracted with chloroform and water, and then the organic layer was dried by using magnesium sulfate. Thereafter, the organic layer was distilled under reduced pressure, and then recrystallized by using ethyl acetate. The produced solid was filtered and then dried to prepare Compound 2 (20.3 g, 76%).
