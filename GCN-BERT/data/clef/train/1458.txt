Step 2: 7-[methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl]amino]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo [1,2-a]pyridine-2-carboxylic acid (120 mg, 384.2 umol) and EDCI (184 mg, 960.5 umol) was dissolved in pyridine (5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at 25°C for 15 min, and then 3,3-difluorocyclobutanamine (120 mg, 384.2 umol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 25°C for 1 hour. LC-MS showed that the raw material was completely consumed. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (20 mL), and extracted with DCM:i-PrOH=3:1(20 mL×3). The combined organic layer was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the residue. The resulting residue was purified through preparative HPLC (alkaline condition) to give N-(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)-7-[methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl]amino]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo [1,2-a]pyridine-2-carboxamide (WX593) (30 mg, 15.9% yield).
