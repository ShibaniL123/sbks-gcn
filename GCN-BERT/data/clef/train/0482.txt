Example 59A
3-Ethyl-1-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
7.5 g (35.7 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 42A and 12.3 g (89.2 mmol) of potassium carbonate were stirred in 200 ml of anhydrous DMF at RT for 15 min, before 10 ml (107 mmol) of 2-bromoethyl methyl ether were added. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 50° C. for 2 h. Thereafter, the majority of the DMF was removed on a rotary evaporator. The residue was diluted with about 800 ml of ethyl acetate, and the mixture was washed successively with water (twice) and saturated sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness. The crude product was purified by chromatography using a Biotage cartridge (340 g of silica gel, eluent: cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 10:1→4:1). After the product fractions had been concentrated and dried, a first portion of 6.51 g of the title compound was obtained. A second portion of 0.91 g was obtained by concentrating the product-containing mixed fractions (1.4 g) and then stirring with 200 ml of pentane/dichloromethane (25:1). A total of 7.42 g (77% of theory) of the title compound were thus obtained.
