EXAMPLE 142
5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-((S)-2-methanesulphonyl-1-methylethyl)-1-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 142)
142.1: (R)-1-methylsulphanyl-propan-2-ol
4.8 ml (69 mmol) of (R)-(+)-propylene-1,2 oxide is added dropwise to a solution containing 7.2 g (103.3 mmol) of sodium methanethiolate in 32 ml of acetonitrile. The mixture is agitated in a sealed tube for 4 hours at 80Â° C. and then diluted with water and with dichloromethane. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with dichloromethane, the organic phase is washed with water and then with brine. After drying over magnesium sulphate, the solution is filtered and then concentrated under vacuum. 3.5 g (48%) of (R)-1-methylsulphanyl-propan-2-ol is obtained in the form of an amber-coloured oil.
