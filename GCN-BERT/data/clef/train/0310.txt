Method 7
4-(1-(R)-t-Butoxycarbonyl-1-aminomethyl)phenol
Sulfuric acid (conc, 1ml) was added to a solution of D-(R)-4-hydroxyphenylglycine (1.0g, 6.0mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (8ml) placed in a Teflon® flask. The flask was cooled to -78°C and isobutylene (8g, 142.6mmol, condensed at -78°C) was added. The flask was placed in an autoclave at room temperature and stirred for 15h. The autoclave was cooled on ice before opened. The excess isobutylene was allowed to evaporate and the remaining solution was poured into aqueous NaOH (2M, 20ml) and was extracted with diethyl ether to remove formed by-product. The aqueous phase was slightly acidified to attain pH=10 using 2M HCl and was extracted with diethyl ether (3x75ml). The organic phase was washed with brine, dried and concentrated. The obtained product was recrystallized in diethyl ether/hexane. Mass: 0.55g (41%). NMR (600MHz, CDCl3) 1.45 (s, 9H), 4.45 (s, 1H), 6.8 (d, 2H), 7.25 (d, 2H); m/z: 224.
