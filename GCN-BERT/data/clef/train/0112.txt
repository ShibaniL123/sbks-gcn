Example 6
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)chroman-2-one (0.100 g, 0.406 mmol) and 2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.070 g, 0.447 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.831 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.95 mL, 1.421 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 48.5° C. for 5 days. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (50 mL) and extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (2×50 mL) followed by washing once with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by precipitating in 1:3 dichloromethane/diethyl ether mixture and filtration to give 2,4-dimethyl-N-(4-(2-oxochroman-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.106 g, 67%) as a beige solid.
