Step 5. 2-Fluoro-1-(methyl-d3)-4-nitrobenzene
A solution of 2-(2-fluoro-4-nitrophenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (0.920 g, 3.45 mmol) and cesium fluoride (1.83 g, 12.1 mmol) in DMF (10.6 mL) and water (2.12 mL) in a seal-able tube was treated with iodomethane-d3 (1.07 mL, 17.2 mmol), degassed with nitrogen for 5 min, and treated with bis(di-tert-butyl(4-dimethylaminophenyl)phosphine)dichloropalladium(II) (0.061 g, 0.086 mmol). The reaction mixture was degassed with nitrogen for another 5 min, sealed, and heated at 45° C. for 21 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with water and ethyl acetate, and filtered over Celite. Three layers were observed during separation. The dark middle layer was filtered again over Celite and combined with the other filtrate. The aqueous layer was separated and re-extracted with ethyl acetate (2×). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to an oil. Purification by flash column chromatography using ethyl acetate in hexanes (0%-10%) gave the desired product (303 mg, 55.6%).
