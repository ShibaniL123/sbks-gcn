A mixture of 8.1 g of Intermediate E, 24 g of bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)iodonium methylsulfate, 1.2 mg of copper(II) benzoate, and 40 g of anisole was stirred at 80Â° C. for 1.5 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, after which 52 g of methyl tert-butyl ether was added and 130 g of pure water added. The water layer was separated, to which 30 g of methylene chloride was added, and 16 g of 25 wt % tetramethylammonium hydroxide aqueous solution added, followed by 15 minutes of stirring. At the end of stirring, 30 g of methylene chloride was added. The organic layer was separated and washed with water. To the organic layer, 1-pentanol and methyl isobutyl ketone were added, followed by vacuum concentration. Methyl tert-butyl ether was added to the residue for recrystallization. The crystal was recovered and dried in vacuum, obtaining the target compound, 2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)(phenyl)sulfoniophenolate (Q-C) (amount 5.5 g, yield 41%).
The target compound was analyzed by spectroscopy. The NMR spectrum, 1H-NMR in DMSO-d6 is shown in FIG. 4. In 1H-NMR analysis, minute amounts of residual solvents (1-pentanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl tert-butyl ether) and water were observed.
