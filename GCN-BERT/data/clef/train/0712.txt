Example 5
Synthesis of 5-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (34 mg, 96 µmol), 6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid (40 mg, 0.29 mmol), triethylamine (70 µL, 0.50 mmol), and HATU (132 mg, 0.35 mmol) were reacted. To the reaction solution, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, and then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was directly subjected to column chromatography (silica gel, 10 g) using a 0.1 N solution of ammonia in methanol and chloroform (concentration gradient, 1 to 50%) as the elution solvent, and thereby purified. In order to eliminate impurities, the obtained compound was suspended in chloroform, and then the suspension was washed with 6% aqueous ammonia. The aqueous layer was extracted with chloroform, then the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, then the insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain the title compound (14 mg, 30%) as pale yellow powder.
