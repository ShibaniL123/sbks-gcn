(E)-methyl3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-((diphenylmethylene)amino)-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5 -difluorophenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-6-(((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)oxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 92e (2.5 g, 4.452 mmol), benzophenone imine (1.05 g, 5.787 mmol), palladium acetate (200 mg, 0.89 mmol), (R)-(+)-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl (554 mg, 0.89 mmol), and cesium carbonate (2.9 g, 8.89 mmol) were dissolved in 40 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The reaction solution was warmed up to 100Â°C and stirred for 12 hours, then cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residues was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-((diphenylmethylene)amino)-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetr ahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 92f (1.8 g, yield 69%) as a light yellow oil.
