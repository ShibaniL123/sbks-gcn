Compound 35-e (1.1 g, 4.29 mmol) and anhydrous magnesium chloride (100 mg) were mixed and the mixture was heated to 200°C for 2 hours and then cooled to room temperature. 0.1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (50 mL) was added to the mixture and then extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL × 3). The combined organic phases were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 10: 1) to deliver a yellow solid 35-d (250 mg, yield: 23%).
