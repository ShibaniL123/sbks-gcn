2-[3-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)propoxy]-6-chloro-N-[(2,4-dimethylthiazol-5-yl)methyl]-5-methyl-pyrimidin-4-amine (F6)
6-chloro-N-[(2,4-dimethylthiazol-5-yl)methyl]-5-methyl-2-methylsulfonyl-pyrimidin-4-amine F5 (480 mg, 1.384 mmol) and 3-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)propan-1-ol (244 mg, 1.38 mmol) were placed in a 20 mL vial and dissolved in THF (5 mL). AIM solution of NaHMDS in THF (1.38 mL, 1.38 mmol) was added, and the reaction was stirred overnight. Solvent was then removed, and the product was purified by silica gel flash column chromatography (EtOAc/hexanes gradient). 500 mg (82%) of F6 were isolated as an off-white foam.
