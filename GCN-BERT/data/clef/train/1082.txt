Step 6. 3-Bromo-6-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine
A solution of 3-bromo-N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine (0.53 g, 1.2 mmol) in TFA (2.9 mL) was heated at 55° C. for 1 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated and then diluted with water (3.0 mL). With the reaction vial in a 0° C. bath, the aqueous mixture was basified with 1.0 M NaOH (7.5 mL). The bath was removed, and the aqueous mixture was stirred for 5 min. The resulting white precipitate was collected via filtration, washed with water (2×10 mL) and dried to afford the crude product as a white solid (0.440 g). Purification via silica gel chromatography (5-40% EtOAc/DCM) afforded the title compound as a white solid (0.25 g, 77%).
