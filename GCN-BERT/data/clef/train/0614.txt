Step 4: Preparation of N-(8-(1-(3-(cyanomethyl)-1-(ethylsulfonyl)azetidine-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl)-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide(WX22)
To a solution of 2-[3-[4-(2-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-8-yl)pyrazole-1 -yl]-1-ethylsulfonyl-azetidine-3-yl]acetonitrile(50 mg, 129.4 umol) and triethylamine (39.28 g, 388.2 umol) dissolved in dichloromethane(5 mL), was added dropwise trifluoroacetic anhydride(81.5 mg, 388.2 umol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 26°C for reacting for 12 hours. After TLC showed that the reaction was completed, H2O (5 mL) was added and the organic layer was separated, the water layer was extracted with DCM(15 mL×3) twice. The organic phase was combined, washed with saturated salt water(10 mL), and washed with saturated salt water(10 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure to remove the filtrate. The residue was purified through preparative thin layer chromatography (DMC:MeOH=20:1) to give (WX22)(29 mg, 46.5% yield).
