Step 5: preparation of intermediate (3S,4S,6S)-N-allyloxy-4-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy-6-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]piperidin-3-amine (4e)
To a solution of tert-butyl (2S,4S,5S)-5-(allyloxyamino)-4-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]piperidine-1-carboxylate (4d) (2.92 g, 5.51 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (110 mL) under inert atmosphere at rt, was added slowly TMSI (1.24 mL, 8.26 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 2h30 at rt. The mixture was then quenched at 0Â°C with MeOH (10 mL). The mixture was quenched with Na2S2O3 15% (200 mL) and extracted with DCM (3 x 50 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated and the resulting residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (Cyclohexane/EtOAc : 90/10 to 0/100) to provide (3S,4S,6S)-N-allyloxy-4-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy-6-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]piperidin-3-amine (4e) (1.88 g, 4.36 mmol, 79%) as a yellow solid.
