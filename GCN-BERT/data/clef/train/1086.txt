c) A mixture of 4-t-butylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (0.075 g, 0.32 mmol) and 2-(isoquinolin-5-yl)-2,4,5,6-tetrahydrocyclopentapyrazol-3-amine (0.050 g, 0.20 mmol) in pyridine (1 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was added 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid and extracted with in 2:1 CH2Cl2/iPrOH (2Ã—10 mL). The combine organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting material was purified by reverse phase HPLC (C18 column, acetonitrile-H2O with 0.1% TFA as eluent) to give the title compound as a white solid (0.025 g, 0.056 mmol, 28%).
