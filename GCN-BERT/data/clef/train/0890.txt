Synthesis of Compound 55
3.0 g of Intermediate 55-2, 3.7 g of Intermediate 55-1 (CAS No. 328917-29-9), 0.38 g of Pd(PPh3)4, 2.8 g of potassium carbonate, 40 mL of toluene, 10 mL of ethanol, and 10 mL of water were added to a round-bottom flask, and then the mixture was refluxed overnight. The obtained reaction solution was cooled to ambient temperature, an organic layer was extracted using ethyl acetate, and then the organic layer was washed with water. The obtained organic layer was dried by using MgSO4, a solvent was removed therefrom by evaporation, and the obtained residue was separated and purified through silica gel chromatography to thereby obtain 2.9 g of Compound 55 (yield: 62%). Compound 55 was identified by LC-MS and 1H-NMR.
