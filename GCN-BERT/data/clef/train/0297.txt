Example 167A
Ethyl 1-(2-methoxyethyl)-2,4-dioxo-3-(2-phenylethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate
1.78 g (16.8 mmol) of caesium carbonate were added to a solution of 3.15 g (7.64 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 164A in 60 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 15 min. Then 2.12 g (15.3 mmol) of 2-bromoethyl methyl ether were added, and the mixture was heated to 80° C. for 5.5 h. After cooling, the mixture was concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The residue obtained was slurried in 400 ml of ethyl acetate and washed successively with water and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the mixture was filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by MPLC on a Biotage cartridge (100 g of silica gel, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 5:1→1:1). The product fractions were combined, concentrated and dried under high vacuum. This gave a first portion of 2.28 g (63% of theory) of the title compound. In addition, a mixed fraction composed of N- and O-alkylated product was also obtained, which was separated by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8) and gave a second portion of 0.55 g (14% of theory) of the title compound. A total of 2.83 g (78% of theory) of the title compound were thus obtained.
