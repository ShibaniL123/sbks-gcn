Step 5: 8-Chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridine-2-carbonitrile
To a solution of 8-chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridine-2-carboxamide (0.130 g, 0.283 mmol) in THF (3 mL) and TEA (0.099 ml, 0.709 mmol) was added TFAA (0.140 mL, 0.992 mmol) dropwise at 0° C. (internal temperature did not exceed 15° C.-monitored using an internal thermometer). Reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 2 hours. Then it was poured into water and the product was extracted with EtOAc (3λ). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution, brine, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The crude was purified with silica-gel chromatography (0-10% MeOH in DCM) to give the title compound (0.09 g, 72%).
