No. D1-158: N-[4-Ethyl-4-methyl-1-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)methanesulfonamide
4-Ethyl-4-methyl-6-nitro-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (1000 mg, 4.27 mmol) was dissolved in a microwave vessel in abs. 1,4-dioxane (10 ml), and the following were added at room temperature: finely powdered cesium carbonate (4180 mg, 12.82 mmol), 4-methylcyclohexyl bromide (1450 mg, 8.24 mmol) and finely powdered potassium iodide (71 mg, 0.43 mmol). The resulting reaction mixture was then stirred in a microwave apparatus at a temperature of 150° C. for one hour and, after cooling to room temperature, concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was taken up with ethyl acetate, water was added, and the water phase was thoroughly extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were washed with sat. sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 4-ethyl-4-methyl-1-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-6-nitro-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (950 mg, 67% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 8.16-8.05 (m, 2H), 7.22 (m, 1H), 4.16 (m, 1H), 2.26 (q, 2H), 2.22 (m, 2H), 1.89-1.62 (m, 6H), 1.56 (d, 3H), 1.32 (s, 3H), 1.18-1.04 (m, 3H), 0.93 (t, 3H). 4-Ethyl-4-methyl-1-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-6-nitro-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (800 mg, 2.42 mmol) was dissolved in methanol, and ammonium chloride (642 mg, 12.10 mmol), zinc powder (786 mg, 12.10 mmol) and water (0.8 ml) were added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for one hour, then filtered through Celite, washed with methanol and concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining residue was taken up with ethyl acetate, water was added, and the water phase was thoroughly extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were then washed with sat. sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 6-amino-4-ethyl-4-methyl-1-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (550 mg, 87% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 6.96 (d, 1H), 6.58-6.51 (m, 2H), 4.12 (m, 1H), 3.58 (br. s, 2H), 2.52-2.37 (m, 4H), 1.94-1.58 (m, 6H), 1.56 (d, 3H), 1.20 (s, 3H), 1.15-1.02 (m, 3H), 0.92 (t, 3H). 6-Amino-4-ethyl-4-methyl-1-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (100 mg, 0.33 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL) and cooled down to 0° C., and pyridine (0.13 ml, 1.66 mmol) and 4-fluorophenylmethanesulfonyl chloride (79 mg, 0.37 mmol) were added. The resulting reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature for one hour and then water and dichloromethane were added, and thorough extraction was effected. The aqueous phase was reextracted repeatedly with dichloromethane, and the combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), N-[4-ethyl-4-methyl-1-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)methanesulfonamide (55 mg, 35% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid.
