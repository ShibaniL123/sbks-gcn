3-((6S,8R)-6-(2,6-difluoro-4-((1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)amino)phenyl)-8-methyl-3,6,8,9-tetrahydro-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-7-yl)-2,2-difluoropropan-1-ol
TBAF in THF (1 M; 160 μL, 0.16 mmol) was added to a solution of N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (80 mg, 0.10 mmol) in THF (0.5 mL) at room temperature. After 4 hours, the reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 30 to 90% (10% MeOH in DCM containing 1% NH4OH) in DCM. Product fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting to residue was repurified using the same conditions. Product fractions were again concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by preparative HPLC (Waters XBridge Prep C18 OBD column, 5μ silica, 19 mm diameter, 100 mm length) using decreasingly polar mixtures of water (containing 0.2% ammonium hydroxide) and MeCN as eluents (40 to 70% over 7 min) to afford 3-((6S,8R)-6-(2,6-difluoro-4-((1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)amino)phenyl)-8-methyl-3,6, 8,9-tetrahydro-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-7-yl)-2,2-difluoropropan-1-ol (17 mg, 31%) as white solid.
