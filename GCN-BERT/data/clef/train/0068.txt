Step 5. tert-Butyl 5-(6-cyano-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)-6-fluoro-3, 4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate
To a solution of tert-butyl 5-(6-cyano-1-trityl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)-6-fluoro-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate (860 mg, 1.353 mmol) in DCM (10.0 ml) was added TFA (6.0 ml). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and then concentrated. The residue was dissolved in DCM, washed with sat. NaHCO3(aq). The aqueous phase was extracted with DCM (10Ã—). The combined organic phases were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in DCM (10.0 ml) and treated with a solution of Boc-anhydride (300.0 mg, 1.375 mmol) in DCM (10.0 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (40 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as a yellow foamy solid (354.7 mg, 67%).
