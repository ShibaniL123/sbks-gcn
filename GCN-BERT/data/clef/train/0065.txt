Preparation of tert-butyl 3-((3-ethoxy-4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)amino)azetidine-1-carboxylate
Dioxane (2.7 mL) was added to a flask charged with (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-ethoxyphenyl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (140 mg, 0.26 mmol), Cs2CO3 (168 mg, 0.52 mmol) and tert-butyl 3-aminoazetidine-1-carboxylate (67 mg, 0.39 mmol). The reaction flask was evacuated and filled with N2 (×3). BrettPhos 3rd Generation Precatalyst (23 mg, 0.030 mmol) was added, and the flask was evacuated and filled with nitrogen (×3). The reaction was heated at 90° C. for 1 hour and then at 90° C. for 44 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting gum was purified by flash chromatography, elution gradient 30 to 100% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford tert-butyl 3-((3-ethoxy-4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)amino)azetidine-1-carboxylate (86 mg, 53%) as a gum.
