Nitroalkane 18-3 (2.1 g) and pyridine (0.48 g) was dissolved in dry dichloromethane (15 mL), and methacylic acid chloride (0.56 g) was added dropwise at 0Â° C., and stirred for 1 hour at a room temperature. After dissolving in chloroform, the mixture was washed with saturated saline solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off. The residue was purified by a silica gel chromatography (chloroform/hexane=3/1) to obtain a colorless clear liquid NAMA (1.0 g, yield 42%).
