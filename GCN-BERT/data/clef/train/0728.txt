Step 4: Preparation of 1-(bromomethyl)-4-(triphenylmethoxy)benzene
In a 100 mL round bottom flask, 1-methyl-4-(triphenylmethoxy) benzene (2.0 g, 5.71 mmol, 1.00 equiv), 2,2'-azo-bis-isobutyronitrile (200.0 mg, 1.22 mmol, 0.21 equiv) and N-bromo succinimide (1.0 g, 5.62 mmol, 1.00 equiv) were dissolved in carbon tetrachloride (30 mL) at room temperature. The resulting solution was stirred for 2 hours at 80° C. in an oil bath. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of water. The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL×2) and the organic layers were combined, washed with brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure. This resulted in 2.3 g (94%) of 1-(bromomethyl)-4-(triphenylmethoxy)benzene as white solid.
