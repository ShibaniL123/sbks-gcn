Example 46. 3-((4-((7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)oxy)piperidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile
50.0 mg of 4-(piperidine-4-yloxy)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine was added to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.00 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 46.0 mg of 3-cyanobenzenesulfonyl chloride was added thereinto, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0600 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and then stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (EtOAc:Hexane=1:1). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 27.7 mg of 3-((4-((7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)oxy)piperidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile was obtained with a yield of about 31.4%.
