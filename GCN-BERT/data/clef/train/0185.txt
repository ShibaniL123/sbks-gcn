Step 3: 1-(4-(3-Amino-3-methylbut-1-yn-1-yl)-2,6-dichlorophenyl)-8-chloro-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)-2-methyl-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
A mixture of 1-(4-(3-amino-3-methylbut-1-yn-1-yl)-2,6-dichlorophenyl)-8-chloro-5-((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)-2-methyl-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (46 mg, 0.084 mmol) and aq. HCl (1N, 1.0 mL, 1.0 mmol) in THF (2 mL) was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was then quenched with aq. NaOH (1N, 1 mL, 1.0 mmol). THF was then removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified with reverse phase HPLC (Waters X-bridge 30Ã—50 mm 5 um column, ACN/H2O with 10 mM NH4OH, 75 mL/min, 1.5 mL injection, gradient: 25-50% ACN in 4.5 min) to afford white solid as the title compound (26 mg, 58% yield).
