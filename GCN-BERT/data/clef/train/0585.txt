Step 2. 3,5-Difluoro-4-(3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridin-5-yl)benzoic acid
1M Solution of sodium hydroxide in water (5 mL, 5 mmol) was added to a solution of methyl 3,5-difluoro-4-(3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridin-5-yl)benzoate (440 mg, 0.881 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) and methanol (3 mL). After stirring at r.t. for 2 h, the pH was adjusted to 5 by the addition of an 1M solution of HCl. The resulting mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate and organic phase was washed with brine. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate and the solvents were evaporated in vacuo. The obtained solid product was used in the next step without further purification (403 mg, 94%).
