Step 4. Ethyl (R)-6-chloro-1-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-3-carboxylate
To a solution of ethyl 2-(3,5-dichloropyrazin-2-yl)-2-oxoacetate (Example 5, Step 3, 14.5 g, 58.4 mmol) in THF (97 mL) was added (R)-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)hydrazine hydrochloride (Example 5, Step 2, 11.7 g, 48.7 mmol). The mixture was warmed to 80° C. for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature. The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature under argon for 12 h. The mixture was diluted with brine and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2×) and the combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a red oil.
The red oil was dissolved in THF (240 mL) and cooled to 0° C. Sodium hydride (60% dispersion in mineral oil, 3.9 g, 97.4 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 h. The mixture was diluted with saturated ammonium chloride (200 mL), water (200 mL), and ethyl acetate (200 mL). The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (10 to 20% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to provide the title compound (9 g, 46% yield) with 99% enantiomeric excess. Enantiomeric excess was determined by HPLC using a Chiralpak® IF-3 column (Daicel, Corporation, West Chester, Pa.) and eluting with 5% IPA/heptanes, Rt=7.2 min. Other enantiomer: ethyl (S)-6-chloro-1-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-3-carboxylate: Rt=3.9 min.
