To a 50-mL round bottom flask, 3-aminopyrazine-2-carboxylic acid (300 mg, 2.17 mmol) and concentrated sulfuric acid (1.3 mL) were added. To the resulting mixture on an ice bath, sodium nitrite (149 mg, 2.16 mmol) dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid (1.6 mL) was added dropwise, and then the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour. The reaction solution was added to ice water, the resulting mixture was vigorously stirred, and the produced solid was collected by filtration. The obtained solid was dried under reduced pressure at 60Â°C for 1 hour to obtain the title compound (166 mg, 55%) as pale yellow crystals.
