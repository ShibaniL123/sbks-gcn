Step C: 8-Ethyl-6-iodo-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a suspension of 1,2-diamino-3-ethyl-5-iodopyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (400 mg, 0.863 mmol) in MeOH (3.3 mL) at 0° C. was added Et3N (0.36 mL, 0.728 mmol), followed by trifluoroacetic anhydride (0.18 mL, 1.32 mmol) dropwise via syringe. The reaction was maintained at 0° C. for 10 min then stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2, 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (249 mg, 84%).
