Example 39. Preparation of N-ethyl-4-(3-(N-phenylpentaneamido)prop-1-yn-1-yl)benzamide (LMT-1017)
The 4-(3-(N-phenylpentaneamido)prop-1-yn-1-yl)benzoic acid (80.00 mg, 0.24 mmol) obtained in Example 38 was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 0.70 ml), ethylaminehydrochloride (29.20 mg, 0.36 mmol) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (48.4 mg, 0.36 mmol), which were stirred in triethylamine (0.70 ml) for 1 hour, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (55.5 mg, 0.36 mmol) were added to the solution and then stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction solution was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with water and brine. An organic solvent layer was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Hex:EA=1:1), thereby obtaining N-ethyl-4-(3-(N-phenylpentaneamido)prop-1-yn-1-yl)benzamide (56.8 mg, 66% yield).
