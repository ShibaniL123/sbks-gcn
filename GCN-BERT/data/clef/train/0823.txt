Step 6: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl N-[[trans-6-allyloxy-4-oxazol-5-yl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-2-yl]methyl]carbamate (1g)
A solution of trans-6-allyloxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-oxazol-5-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (1f) (1.53 g, 5.52 mmol) in pyridine (17 mL) was cooled to 0째C. Methanesulfonyl chloride (0.67 mL, 8.61 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 2 h. After concentrating in vacuo, the crude was dissolved in DCM and successively washed with a solution of 1 N HCl and brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated in vacuo. The crude was dissolved in DMF (29 mL) and NaN3 (1.79 g, 27.59 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was heated at 65째C overnight and concentrated in vacuo. H2O was added to the crude, which was extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was dissolved in a mixture of THF and toluene (16.7 mL/16.7 mL) and trimethylphosphine (1M in THF) (8.28 mL, 8.28 mmol) was added at 0째C. After 1 h stirring at rt, the mixture was cooled to 0째C and a solution of Boc-ON (2.04 g, 8.28 mmol) in THF (11 mL) was dropwise added. The mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc 95/5 to 0/100) to give tert-butyl N-[[trans-6-allyloxy-4-oxazol-5-yl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-2-yl]methyl]carbamate (1 g) (440 mg, 1.17 mmol, 21%).
