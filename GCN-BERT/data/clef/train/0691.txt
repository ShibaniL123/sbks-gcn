1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-α-[N-(sulphomethyl)carbamoyl] benzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine ammonium salt
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-[N-((R)-α-carboxybenzyl) carbamoylmethoxy]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Example 25; 50 mg, 0.078 mmol), aminomethanesulfonic acid (15 mg, 0.088 mmol) and N-methylmorpholine (17.2µl, 0.156 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (2ml). Tetrabutylammoniumhydrogensulfate (35 mg,0.103 mmol) was added and the mixture was heated for 15 minutes at 60°C. After removing heating TBTU (45 mg, 0.14 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred in room temperature 40 minutes then 60°C for one hour. After being stirred overnight 35 mg TBTU was added. After 6 hours 29 mg TBTU in small portions was added and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight. The mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure. The product was purified using preparative HPLC using an acetonitrile/ammonium acetate buffer gradient (5/95 to 100/0) as eluent. To give 10 mg (17%) of the title compound as a ammonium salt.
