(7) Preparation of tert-butyl 7-amino-2-azaspiro[3.5]nonane-2-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 7-oxo-2-azaspiro[3.5]nonane-2-carboxylate (1.2 g, 5.01 mmol) and ammonium acetate (1.55 g, 20.11 mmol) were dissolved in isopropanol (30 mL), sodium borohydride (380.76 mg, 10.02 mmol) was added at -20°C in batches, and the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, diluted with ethyl acetate (50 mL), washed with water (30 mL×3), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate :petroleum ether =1:10-1:1) to obtain the title compound as a white solid (800 mg, yield 67%).
