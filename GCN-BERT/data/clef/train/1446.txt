Step 4. Synthesis of 1-ethyl-6-nitrobenzo[cd]indol-2(1H)-one
To a solution of 1-ethylbenzo[cd]indol-2(1H)-one (500 mg, 2.53 mmol) in AcOH (5 mL) was added HNO3 (154 mg, 2.53 mmol) at 0° C. then the reaction mixture was stirred at 50° C. for 1 h. After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was cooled to rt. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (150 mL×2). The organic layer was washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4. The solid was filtered off, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (6/1, v/v) to yield 1-ethyl-6-nitrobenzo[cd]indol-2(1H)-one (400 mg, 65%) as a yellow solid.
