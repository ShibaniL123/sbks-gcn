Example 28
Synthesis of 5-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)-1-ethylpyridin-2(1H)-one
(1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(Cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (15 mg, 43 µmol), 1-ethyl-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid (16 mg, 94 µmol) synthesized in Reference Example 6, diisopropylethylamine (37 µL, 0.21 mmol), and HATU (36 mg, 94 µmol) were reacted in the same manner as that of Example 1, except that THF alone was used as the solvent. To the reaction solution, a 1.4 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, and then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was suspended in saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and then the suspension was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was subjected to column chromatography (silica gel, 10 g) using methanol and chloroform (concentration gradient, 0 to 30%) as the elution solvent to obtain the title compound (13.3 mg, 62%) as white amorphous substance.
