3-methoxy-6-(1-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopropyl)picolinaldehyde
3-Methoxypicolinaldehyde (0.117 g, 0.850 mmol) and sodium 1-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopropane-1-sulfinate (0.500 g, 2.55 mmol) were dissolved in diethylcarbonate (5.1 mL) and water (3.4 mL), and the mixture was cooled to 0° C. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (70% aqueous, 0.547 g, 4.25 mmol) was then added dropwise. The reaction was stirred in the ice bath for 5 minutes and was then heated at 90° C. for 2 hours. After this time, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, quenched with saturated aqueous Na2S2O3 solution (10 mL), and diluted with ethanol (20 mL). The mixture was concentrated in vacuo, and the resulting material was taken up in 20% CH3OH-ethyl acetate and filtered through a pad of silica gel on a fritted glass funnel, eluting with 10% CH3OH-ethyl acetate. The combined filtrates were concentrated in vacuo, and the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography, eluting with 40% ethyl acetate-heptanes to 100% ethyl acetate (gradient). The title compound was obtained, 0.0253 g, 12% yield.
