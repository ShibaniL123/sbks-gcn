Step 10: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl N-[[(2S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4,7-dioxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-yl]methyl]carbamate (4j)
To a solution of intermediate tert-butyl N-[[(2S,4S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4-hydroxy-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-yl]methyl]carbamate (4i) (0.350 g, 1.07 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (21 mL) under inert atmosphere at 0Â°C was added the Dess-Martin periodinane reagent (0.680 g, 1.60 mmol). The reaction was stirred for 2h30 at rt then the mixture was washed with a saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution, a 15% Na2S2O3 solution, water, dried oved Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc : 100/0 to 0/100) to afford intermediate tert-butyl N-[[(2S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4,7-dioxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-yl]methyl]carbamate (4j) (0.300 g, 0.92 mmol, 74%) as a colorless oil.
