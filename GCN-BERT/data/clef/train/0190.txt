Step 4. Benzyl 1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-4-ylcarbamate
To a solution of (4-(((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino)-2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-1-yl)methyl acetate (391 mg, 1.28 mmol) in MeOH (6.0 mL) was added potassium carbonate (230 mg, 1.67 mmol) at 0Â° C. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 30 min. The reaction mixture was partitioned between water and EtOAc, and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc and the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. The resulting white solid was used without purification (316 mg, 94%).
