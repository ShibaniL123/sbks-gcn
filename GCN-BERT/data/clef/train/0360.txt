Example 2
rac-7-[(2,6-Difluorobenzyl)oxy]-N-{2-[2-(difluoromethyl)-2H-tetrazol-5-yl]-1-hydroxypropan-2-yl}-2,5-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide
40 mg (0.10 mmol) of 7-[(2,6-difluorobenzyl)oxy]-2,5-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxylic acid from Example 4A were initially charged together with 40 mg (0.11 mmol) of HATU and 88 μl (0.51 mmol) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine in 0.4 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min. 21 mg (0.11 mmol) of rac-2-amino-2-[2-(difluoromethyl)-2H-tetrazol-5-yl]propan-1-ol Example 20A were then added to the reaction solution, and the mixture was stirred at 60° C. for 6 h. The mixture was then diluted with acetonitrile and water, TFA was added and the mixture was purified by preparative HPLC (RP18 column, mobile phase: acetonitrile/water gradient with addition of 0.1% TFA). The product fractions were combined and concentrated. Subsequently, the residue was taken up in dichloromethane and a little methanol, and washed twice with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The aqueous phase was extracted twice with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, concentrated and lyophilized. This gave 40 mg of the target compound (74% of theory, purity 95%).
