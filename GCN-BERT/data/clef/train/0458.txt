Example 2-3 : Preparation of 1,1'-(3-methoxypyrazin-2,6-diyl)diethanone (XI)
3,5-Dibromo-2-methoxypyrazine (X) (600 mg, 2.24 mmol), palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) (40.22 mg, 179.16 µmole), and 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (DPPP) (147.80 mg, 358.33 µmole) were dissolved in 2.5 mL of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim] [BF4]). To the resulting solution was slowly added dropwise butyl vinyl ether (2.32 mL, 17.92 mmole) and triethylamine (TEA) (1.0 mL, 7.17 mmole). The solution was stirred at 125 °C for 24 hrs and then cooled to room temperature. 2N hydrochloric acid (HCl) was slowly added dropwise to the solution to adjust pH to 1∼2 and then the solution was stirred for 30 min and neutralized. The solution was diluted with dichloromethane and washed with water. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-Hex/EA = 3/1) to give the title compound (65 mg, 15%).
