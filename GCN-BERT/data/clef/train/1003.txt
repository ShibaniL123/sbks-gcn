(R)-1-(3-Fluoro-1H-indazol-4-yl)-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)propan-2-amine
2,2,2-Trifluoroethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 0.1M solution in DCM (25.9 mL, 2.59 mmol) was added to (R)-1-(3-fluoro-1H-indazol-4-yl)propan-2-amine (0.4 g, 2.07 mmol) and DIPEA (0.541 mL, 3.11 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (20 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred at 75Â° C. overnight. The reaction was concentrated in vacuo and partitioned between ethyl acetate (25 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (25 mL). The layers were separated and the aqueous layer extracted with ethyl acetate (25 mL). The combined organics were washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (25 mL), dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting gum was taken up in methanol and applied to a pre-wetted (methanol) SCX-2 cartridge. The cartridge was washed with methanol and eluted with 1M ammonia in methanol. The eluent was concentrated in vacu to give (R)-1-(3-fluoro-1H-indazol-4-yl)-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)propan-2-amine (0.455 g, 80%) as a brown gum.
