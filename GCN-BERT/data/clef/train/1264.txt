Step 1. tert-Butyl ((3S,6R)-6-(fluoromethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)carbamate
A solution of tert-butyl ((3S,6R)-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)carbamate (0.040 g, 0.17 mmol) [J. Med. Chem. (2013), 56, 7396] in dichloromethane (1.7 mL) at −78° C. was treated with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (0.046 mL, 0.35 mmol) dropwise and stirred at room temperature for 5 h. The reaction mixture was cooled back to −78° C., treated with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (0.046 mL, 0.35 mmol), and stirred at room temperature for 14 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0° C., quenched with saturated sodium bicarbonate (20 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL). The organic layer was separated, washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to a residue. Purification by flash column chromatography using ethyl acetate in hexanes (0%-40%) gave the desired trans product (9.3 mg, 23%) as a white solid. LCMS for C11H20FNO3Na (M+Na)+: m/z=256.1; Found: 256.1.
