(8) Preparation of tert-butyl 3-((2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxamido)-8-azabicyclo[ 3.2.1]octane-8-carboxylate
(2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylic acid (0.5 g, 1.8 mmol), tert-butyl 3-amino-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-8-carboxylate (0.4 g, 1.8 mmol), 1-hydroxylbenzotriazole (0.25 g, 1.8 mmol), 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (0.7 g, 3.6 mmol) and triethylamine (0.4 g, 3.9 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL), stirred and reacted under nitrogen gas protection at 25 Â°C for 16 h. The reaction solution was distilled in vacuum, and the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate =1:1) to obtain the title compound as colorless oil (0.4 g, yield 46.5 %).
