Step 2. tert-Butyl 4,6-difluoro-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl(methyl)carbamate
To a solution of tert-butyl (4,6-difluoro-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl)(methyl)carbamate (5.27 g, 18.60 mmol) in THF (100.0 ml) at −78° C. under N2 was added a solution of n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes) (15.00 ml, 37.5 mmol) slowly over a period of 20 min. The reaction was allowed to warm to −60° C. and stirred for 90 min. The reaction was then cooled back to −78° C. 2-Isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (10.79 g, 58.0 mmol) was added slowly over a period of 20 min. After stirring at −78° C. for another 10 min, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with sat. NaHCO3, and extracted with Et2O. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (120 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as an oil (1.74 g, 23%).
