The second step The synthesis of Compound I-156
To a mixed solution of Compound 89 (795mg, 1.45mmol) in ethanol (4 mL) and THF (4 mL) was added 2 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (3.62mL, 7.24mmol), and the mixture was heating under reflux and stirred for 2.5 hours. The reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform after addition of 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure by an evaporator. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to yield compound 1-156 (68.2mg, yield 89%) as a white solid.
