Preparation of a diastereoisomeric mixture of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-7-(-2-fluoro-3-methoxy-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
A solution of sodium nitrite (0.277 g, 4.02 mmol) in water (1.0 mL) was added to a solution of a diastereoisomeric mixture of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-(2-fluoro-3-methoxy-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (1.70 g, 3.65 mmol) in propionic acid (15 mL) at −10° C. The reaction was stirred for 1 hour, then ice-cold EtOAc (20 mL) was added. The reaction was quenched by addition of aqueous NaHCO3 solution (30 mL) and stirred for 15 minutes, before being allowed to warm to room temperature. The organic phase was washed with aqueous NaHCO3 solution (30 mL) and brine (20 mL), dried (Na2SO4), filtered and evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 50% EtOAc in heptane to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-7-(2-fluoro-3-methoxy-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (0.950 g, 55%) as a brown solid as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
