Example 4: synthesis of sodium and 2,2,2-trifluroacetate [(2S,5S)-4-(2-amino-2-oxo-ethoxy)imino-2-(azaniumylmethyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl] sulfate
Step 1 : preparation of intermediate tert butyl (1S,3S,6R)-3-(hydroxymethyl)-7-oxa-4-azabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane-4-carboxylate (4a)
To a solution of 4-tert-butyl ester 3-methyl ester (1R,4S,6S)-7-oxa-3-aza-bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane-3,4-dicarboxylate (2a) (5.40 g, 21.01 mmol) in anhydrous THF (105 mL) under inert atmosphere to -78°C was added a solution of LiAlH4 2M in THF (10.5 mL, 21.01 mmol). The reaction was stirred 3 h between -78°C and -20°C. The reaction was quenched by adding of Na2SO4.10H2O. The mixture was warmed to 20°C, stirred 30 min then filtered over Celite®. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum and provided tert-butyl (1S,3S,6R)-3-(hydroxymethyl)-7-oxa-4-azabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane-4-carboxylate (4a) (3.76g, 16.39 mmol, 78%) as a colorless oil which was used for the next step without further purification.
