Step 5
To a solution of Compound 10i (6g, 14.38mmol) in methanol (60 mL) was added potassium carbonate (9.94g, 71.9mmol), and the mixture was heated under reflux and stirred for 3 hours. 2 mol / L hydrochloric acid was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (chloroform - methanol) to yield Compound 11i (2.6g, yield 48%) as a yellow solid.
