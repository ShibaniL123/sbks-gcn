Synthesis of compound 38-b
At 0Â°C, trifluoroacetic acid (2mL) was added to a solution of compound 38-c (170mg, 0.5mmol) and triethylsilane (392mg, 4mmol) in DCM (10mL). The mixture was warmed to room temperature and further stirred for 16hrs, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. DCM (30mL) was added to the residue. The mixture was in turn washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (10mL) and saturated brine (10mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica column chromatography (PE:EA = 10:1) to give compound 38-b (150mg, yield 92%).
