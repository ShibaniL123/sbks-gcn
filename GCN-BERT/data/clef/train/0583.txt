Step 2
4,4-Difluorocyclohexylmethyl methanesulfonate
(4,4-Difluoro-cyclohexyl)methanol (300 mg, 2.00 mmol) and triethylamine (303 mg, 3.00 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL), and methanesulfonyl chloride (458 mg, 4.00 mmol) was slowly added at 0°C. The reaction solution was stirred at 0°C for 4 hours. The reaction was quenched with water (10 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (30 mL x 2). The organic phases were combined, washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 4,4-difluorocyclohexylmethyl methanesulfonate (350 mg, as a white solid) with a yield of 77%.
