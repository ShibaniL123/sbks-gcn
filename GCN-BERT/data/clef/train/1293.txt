Step B: 6-(7-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-8-yl)benzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one
To a solution of 6-(7-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-8-yl)-3-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)benzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one (48.3 mg, 86.3 Î¼mol) in DCM (1.4 mL) was added TFA (0.7 mL), and the mixture stirred at rt for 1 h. The solvent was then removed in vacuo, and the residue dissolved in a 2 M solution of NH3 in MeOH (1 mL). The mixture was stirred overnight, the solvent removed in vacuo, and the residue purified by reverse-phase preparative HPLC (XBridge 18C OBD column, 5-99% ACN in 20 mM NH4OH) to afford the title compound (19.4 mg, 52% yield).
