Example 97A
6-Ethynyl-3-methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylic acid
8.0 ml (8.0 mmol) of a 1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution were added to a solution of 500 mg (1.34 mmol) of the compound from Example 96A in a mixture of 37 ml THF and 8 ml of methanol, and the mixture was stirred initially at RT for 16 h, then at 50° C. for 16 h and subsequently at 70° C. for 24 h. After cooling to RT, 0.72 ml (9.37 mmol) of TFA was added and the mixture was stirred at RT for 1 h and then concentrated. The residue was taken up in DMSO and the solid present was filtered off, rinsing with acetonitrile. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue obtained by concentration of the filtrate was dissolved in a mixture of 38 ml DMSO and water and purified by preparative HPLC [column: Chromatorex C18 125 mm×30 mm; flow rate: 100 ml/min; detection: 210 nm; injection 1 ml; gradient acetonitrile/water/(water+0.1% TFA) 10:85:5-60:35:5; run time 6.5 min)]. This gave 173 mg (45% of theory, purity 100%) of the title compound
