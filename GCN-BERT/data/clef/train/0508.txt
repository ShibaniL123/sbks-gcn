Step 3: Preparation of 3-(4-(diethylcarbamoyl)phenyl)prop-2-yn-1-yl methanesulfonate
N,N-diethyl-4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)benzamide (5.16 mg, 22.3 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 ml), and cooled on ice. Triethylamine (4.80 ml, 34.4 mmol) was added to the mixture, and stirred for 5 minutes. Methanesulfonyl chloride (1.95 ml, 25.2 mmol) was added at the same temperature, the ice was removed, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with water and brine. An organic solvent layer was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Hex:EA=2:1), thereby obtaining 3-(4-(diethylcarbamoyl)phenyl)prop-2-yn-1-yl methanesulfonate (4.2 mg, 59% yield).
