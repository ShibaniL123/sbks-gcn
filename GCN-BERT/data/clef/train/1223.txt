[Step 2] Synthesis of compound 11340
N-(2-fluoro-4-(2-(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)benzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)acetamide (0.120 g, 0.289 mmol), synthesized in step 1, and 1-methoxy-N-triethylammoniosulfonyl-methanimidate (Burgess reagent, 0.103 g, 0.433 mmol) were mixed in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL), and the mixture was heated by microwave irradiation at room temperature for 1 hour, and then cooled to room temperature to terminate the reaction. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 80%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.029 g, 25.3%) as colorless oil.
