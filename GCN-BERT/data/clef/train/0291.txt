EXAMPLES
Example 1: compound (2) in table I
4-chloro-3-nitrophenol (5 g, 28.8 mmol, 1 eq.) was placed in dimethylformamide (96 mL) with 4-(2-chloro-ethyl)morpholine (16 g, 86.4 mmol, 3 eq.), Cs2CO3 (65 g, 0.20 mmol, 7 eq.), KI (10.5 g, 63.4 mmol, 2.2 eq.). The reaction mixture was heated at 80Â°C and stirred for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with a 1% NaOH aqueous solution, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to afford 4-(2-(4-chloro-3-nitrophenoxy)ethyl)morpholine. (7.5 g, 96%).
