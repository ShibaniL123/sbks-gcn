Step 6
To a solution of Compound 11i (3.6g, 9.59mmol) in ethanol (36mL) were added silver nitrate (3.26g, 19.19mmol) and iodine (4.87g, 19.19mmol) under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. The insoluble materials were filtered, and the filtrate was extracted with chloroform after addition of aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 12i (4.5 g, yield 94%) as a brown solid.
