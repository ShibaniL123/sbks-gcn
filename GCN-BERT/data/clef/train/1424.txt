Example 13
Preparation of N-(3-amino-2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-chloro-5-((1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-3-fluorobenzamide (F1255)
To a solution of tert-butyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-N-[3-[[2-chloro-5-[[(1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-carbonyl]amino]-3-fluorobenzoyl]amino]-2,6-difluorophenyl]carbamate (F1239) (0.166 g, 0.21 mmol) in dioxane (1 mL) was added a 4 molar solution of hydrogen chloride in dioxane (0.53 mL, 2.12 mmol), and the colorless solution was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The light-yellow solution was concentrated and the residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate (5 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (5 mL). The phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with additional ethyl acetate (2×2.5 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine (3 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to an amber residue. The residue was dissolved in minimal ethyl acetate and adsorbed to Celite®. Purification by automated flash chromatography using a gradient of 0-40% ethyl acetate in hexanes as eluent provided the title compound as a white solid (0.111 g, 88%).
