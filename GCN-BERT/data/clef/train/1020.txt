Trifluoroacetic acid (2.0 mL, 26 mmol) was added to a solution of crude tert-butyl 4-((8-cyclopentyl-6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-7-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)-amino)piperidine-1-carboxylate (136B, 130 mg, 0.284 mmol) in dichloromethane (6 mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes, then concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (6 mL). Triethylamine (0.238 mL, 1.70 mmol) and isopropylsulfonyl chloride (0.035 mL, 0.313 mmol) were added, and the mixture stirred at room temperature. After 20 minutes, more isopropylsulfonyl chloride (0.015 mL, 0.134 mmol) was added, and after another 20 min an additional amount of isopropylsulfonyl chloride (0.030 mL, 0.269 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred for 15 more minutes, then was quenched with 4 N NaOH (0.6 mL) and stirred vigorously. Extraction with dichloromethane and purification by preparative SFC afforded 8-cyclopentyl-6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-{[1-(propan-2-ylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]-amino}pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (Example 136, 28.3 mg, 22%) as a solid.
