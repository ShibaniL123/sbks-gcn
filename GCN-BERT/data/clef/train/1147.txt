Step 5
Under ice cooling, to Compound 191 (1.68 g, 3.73 mmol) in DMF (21 mL) solution was added N-bromosuccinimide (796 mg, 4.47 mmol), and the mixture was stirred under ice-cooling for 30 minutes. Water (30 mL) and saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (30 mL) were added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic layer was washed with saturated brine (30 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 192 (1.66 g, 79% yield) as a white solid.
