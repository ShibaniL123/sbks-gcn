Intermediate 62: 7-Chloro-6-(difluoromethyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Step A: 2-Chloropyridine-3-carbaldehyde. To a solution of diisopropylamine (14.8 mL, 106 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) was added n-butyllithium (2.27 M solution in n-hexane, 42 mL, 95.3 mmol) slowly at −78° C. under argon. The reaction mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 15 min. To the reaction mixture was added 2-chloropyridine (10 g, 88.1 mmol) as a solution in tetrahydrofuran (150 mL) dropwise at −78° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 15 min. To the reaction mixture was added N,N-dimethylformamide (8.2 mL, 106 mmol) dropwise at −78° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 15 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1 h. The reaction mixture was poured into a vigorously stirred mixture of ethyl acetate (1.5 L) and aqueous ammonium chloride (1 M, 500 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (1×1 L) and brine (1×1 L). The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated. Purification (FCC, SiO2, eluting with n-hexane:ethyl acetate (50:1→4:1)) afforded the title compound (2.70 g, 19.1 mmol, 21%) as a yellow solid.
