Compound 2-8 (80 mg, 0.115 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (2 ml) and methanol (0.5 ml), and the reaction mixture was heated to an external temperature of 80 Â°C and refluxed overnight. The next day, the resultant was concentrated and isolated by column chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl acetate (v/v) = 10/1) to give product 2-9 (77 mg, yield 99%).
