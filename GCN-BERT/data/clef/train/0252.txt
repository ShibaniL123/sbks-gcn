Synthesis of 4-bromo-7-(5-bromo-4-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole is depicted in FIG. 9: 4-bromo-5,6-difluoro-7-[4-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-2-yl]-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (2.14 g, 3.487 mmol) was added to a 100 mL Schlenk flask followed by 60 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF). The solution was cooled to −78° C. before N-bromosuccinimide (0.652 g, 3.661 mmol) was added in portions with the absence of light. The reaction was stirred overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding saturated potassium carbonate solution and then was extracted with hexane. The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removal of the solvent, the resulting mixture was subjected to column purification with hexane as the eluent. A yellow crystal (0.83 g, 34.3%) was obtained as product after recrystallization in iso-propanol at −20° C. and being dried under vacuum at room temperature.
