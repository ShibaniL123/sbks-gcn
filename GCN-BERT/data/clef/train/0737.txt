Example 27
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol) and 2,5-dimethyl-1H-imidazole-4-carboxylic acid (0.063 g, 0.448 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.832 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.85 mL, 1.432 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50° C. for 12 days. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (3 mL) and extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (3×50 mL) followed by washing with sat. NaHCO3 (2×50 mL). The crude solid was dried loaded onto silica and purified by flash chromatography using 95:5 dichloromethane/methanol to give 2,4-dimethyl-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxamide (0.07 g, 47%) as a peach solid.
