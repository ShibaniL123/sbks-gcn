Example 297A
1-(3-Fluoropropyl)-3-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbaldehyde
341 mg (2.47 mmol) of potassium carbonate were added to a solution of 285 mg (0.98 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 53A in 9 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 15 min. Then 557 mg (2.96 mmol) of 1-fluoro-3-iodopropane were added, and the mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 19 h. The DMF was then very substantially distilled off and the remaining residue was partitioned between semisaturated sodium chloride solution (100 ml) and ethyl acetate (50 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The residue obtained was chromatographed using a silica gel cartridge (Biotage, 100 g of silica gel, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate). 175 mg (52% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
