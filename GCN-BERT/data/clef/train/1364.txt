(6) Preparation of tert-butyl 4-(7-amino-5-methylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-yl)piperidin-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl4-(7-amino-6-bromo-5-methylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-yl)-3,6-di hydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxylate (1.3 g, 3.16 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (50 mL).Under the protection of nitrogen gas, Pd/C (1.3 g) was added to the system. At the atmosphere of hydrogen gas, the resultant mixture was reacted at room temperature under stirring for 16h. After the reaction, the resultant mixture was filtrated and concentrated to obtain the product (800mg, yield: 76%).
