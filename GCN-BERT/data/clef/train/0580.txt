Step 3
To a solution of Compound 16i (4.9g, 12.4mmol) in dichloromethane (25mL) were added pyridine (2.51mL, 31.1mmol) and 2-trimethylsilyl ethyl sulfonyl chloride (2.83mL, 14.9mmol) under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction solution was extracted with dichloromethane after addition of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. The organic layer was washed with 2mol / L aqueous hydrochloric acid and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 17i (6.6 g, 86%, purity 90%) as colorless foam compound.
