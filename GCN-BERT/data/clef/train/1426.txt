Intermediate 48: 8-Bromo-2,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine
To a solution of 5-bromo-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-amine (Intermediate 12, 150 mg, 0.62 mmol) in 1,4 dioxane (0.45 mL) were added 4A° molecular sieves followed by the addition of 3-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-one (0.45 mL, 4.3 mmol). The mixture was heated to 90° C. for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with sat.aq.NaHCO3, and extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine; dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as off-white solid (143 mg, 69% yield).
