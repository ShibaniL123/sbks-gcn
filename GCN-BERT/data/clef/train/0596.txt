The second step
To a solution of Compound 36 (1.14g, 1.97mmol) in DMF (12 mL) were added cesium carbonate (1.29 g, 3.95 mmol) and 1,2-dibromoethane (0.255 mL, 2.96 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18.5 hours. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of water. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 37 (1.13g, yield 95%).
