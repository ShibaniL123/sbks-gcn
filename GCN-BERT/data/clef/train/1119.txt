Preparation of tert-butyl (1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)carbamate
Potassium carbonate (1.605 g, 11.61 mmol), tert-butyl azetidin-3-ylcarbamate (1.0 g, 5.81 mmol) and 1-fluoro-3-iodopropane (1.146 g, 6.10 mmol) were suspended in acetonitrile (11.61 mL) and sealed into a microwave tube. The reaction was heated to 95Â° C. for 15 minutes in the microwave reactor. Reaction was cooled to room temperature, diluted with EtOAc (100 mL) and extracted from saturated NaHCO3 (50 mL). The organic phase was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to afford tert-butyl (1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)carbamate (1.248 g, 93%) as a yellow solid.
