EXAMPLE 22
Preparation of (S)-6-chloro-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
10 mg (0.022 mmol) of (S)-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one prepared in Example 1 was dissolved in 1 mL of acetic acid, to which 3.3 mg (0.025 mmol) of N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) was added, followed by stirring at 50˜60° C. for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and filtered under reduced pressure. Saturated sodiumbicarbonate aqueous solution was added thereto, followed by neutralization. Dichloromethane and water were added thereto, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: dichloromethane/methanol, 50/1-dichloromethane/methanol, 20/1) to give 3 mg of the target compound (S)-6-chloro-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one as a pale yellow solid (0.006 mmol, yield: 28%).
