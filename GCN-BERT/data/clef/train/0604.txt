A mixture of pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (3.87 g, 10.0 mmol), propyl 3-hydroxybenzoate (6.30 g, 35 mmol), potassium carbonate (6.90 g, 50 mmol) and DMF (20 mL) was stirred under argon and heated at 100° C. for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into ice/water (200 mL) and extracted with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, 200 mL). The extract was washed with water (2×200 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using silica gel and hexane/DCM/ethyl acetate (48:50:2) as an eluent to give pure Compound B2, dipropyl 4,4'-((2-(bromomethyl)-2-((4-(propoxycarbonyl)phenoxy)methyl)propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy))dibenzoate, (1.59 g, 23% yield).
