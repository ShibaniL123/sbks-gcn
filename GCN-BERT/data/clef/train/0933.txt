Synthesis Example 1
First, trifluoroacetic acid (1.2 mL, 15.75 mmol) was added dropwise to a dichloromethane solution (35 mL) containing 2,4-dimethyl pyrrole (2.16 mL, 21 mmol) and triethyl orthoformate (1.75 mL, 10.5 mmol). Next, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Then, the reaction solution was diluted with water and was extracted using dichloromethane to recover an organic layer. The organic layer was washed with saturated saline and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure, the remainder was dissolved in a small amount of dichloromethane. Subsequently, hexane was added to the resulting solution to yield precipitates. The precipitates were filtered and washed with hexane to give compound 1 as an orange solid (2.73 g, 83%).
