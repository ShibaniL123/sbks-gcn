Step 1. N-(5-bromo-2-fluoropyridin-3-yl)ethanesulfonamide
To a solution of 5-bromo-2-fluoropyridin-3-amine (3 g, 20 mmol) in pyridine (10 mL) and DCM (20 mL) at room temperature was added ethanesulfonyl chloride (2.2 mL, 24 mmol). After stirring for 30 min, the solvent was evaporated. The resulting residue was diluted with MeOH (4 mL) and partitioned between EtOAc and brine. The organic layer was separated, and the aq. layer was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography afforded the title compound (2 g, 40%). LCMS for C7H9BrFN2O2S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=283.0, 285.0; found 283.0, 284.9.
