Step 4
3,7-Dimethyl-1-[3-(1-methyl-4-pyrazolyl)-propyl]-3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione
3-(1-Methyl-4-pyrazolyl)-propyl methanesulfonate (90.0 mg, 0.413 mmol), 3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H, 7H)-dione (74.3 mg, 0.413 mmol) and potassium carbonate (114 mg, 0.826 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (3 mL). The reaction solution was heated to 120Â°C and stirred for 3 hours, then cooled to room temperature and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by preparative HPLC to give 3,7-dimethyl-1-[3-(1-methyl-4-pyrazolyl)-propyl]-3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione (25.0 mg) with a yield of 30%.
