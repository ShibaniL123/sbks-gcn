Example 23A
Methyl 6-(difluoromethyl)-3-methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylate
1.0 g (3.2 mmol) of the compound from Example 22A were dissolved in 40 ml of dichloromethane. The mixture was cooled to −78° C., and 1.4 g (7.86 mmol, 90% purity) of N,N-diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST) were added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight, in the course of which it warmed up to RT, and then saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution was added. The phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, mobile phase cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 5:1). After the solvent had been removed, the residue was dried under reduced pressure. This gave 737 mg (69% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
