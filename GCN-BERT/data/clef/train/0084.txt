Step 2: 2-Bromo-6-amino-6-(2-chlorophenyl)cyclohexanone Hydrobromide. A solution of 298 g (1.33 mol) of 2-Amino-2-(2-chlorophenyl)cyclohexanone in 1.2 L of 48% aqueous HBr is heated to 70° C., and 216 g (1.35 mol) of bromine is added dropwise. The mixture is stirred for 10 min after the addition is complete and cooled to 5° C. The crystals are removed by filtration, washed copiously with acetone, and dried to give 408 g of the title compound mp 142-145° C. A second crop (30 g, mp 142-145° C.) is obtained by decolorizing and concentrating the acetone washes. An NMR is run in D2O and shows the presence of excess protons in the HOD peak. The entire yield of 441 g is azeotroped in 500 mL of xylene, with the recovery being 420 g (82%; mp 209-210° C.) and the water collected in a Dean-Stark trap corresponding to a monohydrate.
