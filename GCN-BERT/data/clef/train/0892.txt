Example 4
DY319 (Berberine-Topi Derivative).
To a warm solution of berberine chloride (0.45 g, 1.21 mmol) in anhydrous ethanol (20 mL), topiramate (4.11 g, 12.1 mmol) was added and the mixture was refluxed 16 h. After cooling down, the reaction mixture was filtrated to remove unreacted berberine. The solvent was concentrated in vacuo to get crude dark brown oil which was solidified by EtOAc, filtrated on a Buchner apparatus, extensively rinsed with EtOAc, CHCl3, and then dried under vacuum at 60° C. overnight to give a desired product DY319 as a red-yellow powder (0.17 mg, 20%), mp: 211.1° C.
