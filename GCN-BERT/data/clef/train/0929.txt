(1-2) [1-(trans-4-Methylcyclohexyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl]methanol
A solution of N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (77.4 g) and isocyanoethyl acetate (70.0 g) in methanol (56 mL) was stirred at 5° C. to 10° C. for 4 hours. Thereafter, the reaction solution was cooled to 0° C., and water (5.3 mL) and trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine (105.1 g) were then added thereto. The mixture was stirred at 60° C. to 65° C. for 24 hours. Thereafter, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, and toluene (420 mL) and 10% saline (280 mL) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (68 mL) were then added thereto, followed by liquid separation. After that, the organic layer was washed with 10% saline (140 mL). To the organic layer, 10% saline (280 mL) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (78.4 g) were added, and the mixture was then subjected to liquid separation. Thereafter, to the organic layer, 10% saline (210 mL) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (31.3 g) were further added, followed by liquid separation. Sodium chloride (70.0 g) was dissolved in the water layer, and toluene (420 mL) and a 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (85 mL) were then added to the solution, followed by liquid separation. Thereafter, toluene (350 mL) was added to the organic layer, and the mixture was then dehydrated and concentrated under reduced pressure to prepare a toluene (420 mL) solution. This solution was cooled to 0° C., and sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride (70% toluene solution) (207.4 g) was then added dropwise thereto. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Thereafter, the reaction solution was cooled to 0° C., and a 12.5% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (700 mL) was then added dropwise thereto. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Thereafter, the solution was subjected to liquid separation, and the organic layer was successively washed with a 12.5% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (700 mL) and 20% saline (140 mL), and then, to the organic layer, toluene (140 mL), 1-butanol (14 mL), water (280 mL) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (48 mL) were added, followed by liquid separation. Thereafter, to the organic layer, water (140 mL) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (2 mL) were further added, followed by liquid separation. The water layers were combined, activated carbon (10.5 g) was then added thereto, and the mixture was then stirred for 1 hour. Thereafter, the activated carbon was filtrated, and the filtrated activated carbon was then washed with water (210 mL). The filtrate and the washing solution were combined, and to the mixture, sodium chloride (140 g), toluene (980 mL) and a 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (42 mL) were added. The obtained mixture was subjected to liquid separation, and the organic layer was then dehydrated and concentrated under reduced pressure to prepare a toluene (210 mL) solution. This solution was stirred at 50° C. to 55° C. for 30 minutes, and was then cooled to room temperature. Heptane (560 mL) was added dropwise to the solution, and the mixture was then stirred at the same temperature for 3 hours. The precipitated crystals were filtrated, and were then washed with a mixed solution of toluene/heptane (1/4). The resultant was dried under reduced pressure to obtain the title compound (77.2 g, yield: 64.2%).
