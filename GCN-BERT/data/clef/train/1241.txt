Step 2: Synthesis of di-μ-chloro-tetrakis[3-(2-methylpyridin-5-yl)-2-(2-pyridinyl-κN)phenyl-κC]iridium(III) (Abbreviation: [Ir(mpyppy)2Cl]2)
Into a 100-mL round-bottom flask were put 2.4 g (10 mmol) of 2-[2-(2-methyl-5-pyridyl)phenyl]pyridine (abbreviation: Hmpyppy) synthesized in Step 1, 1.3 g (4.5 mmol) of iridium chloride monohydrate, 30 mL of 2-ethoxyethanol, and 10 mL of water, and the atmosphere in the flask was replaced with argon. This reaction container was subjected to irradiation with microwaves (2.45 GHz, 100 W) for 3 hour to cause a reaction. After the reaction, the reaction solution was subjected to suction filtration to give 1.7 g of a yellow solid in a yield of 53%. A scheme of the synthesis of Step 2 is shown below.
