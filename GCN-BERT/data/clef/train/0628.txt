Step 3: Preparation of 1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-2-yl)ethane-1-amine
250 mg (0.680 mmol) of tert-butyl(1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-2-yl)ethyl)carbamate prepared in step 2 was dissolved in dichloromethane (3 mL) , to which 1 mL of TFA was added, followed by stirring at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered under reduced pressure and neutralized with NaHCO3 aqueous solution. The reaction mixture was added with dichloromethane and water, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was separated, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 5/1) to give 120 mg of the target compound 1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-2-yl)ethane-1-amine as a yellow oil (0.449 mmol, yield: 66%).
