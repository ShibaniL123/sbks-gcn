Step 3: Preparation of 3-(4-(morpholine-4-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl methanesulfonate
3-(4-(morpholine-4-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl methanesulfonate was obtained (391 mg, yield 80%) by the same method as described in Step 4 of Example 1 using the (4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)phenyl)(morpholino)methanone (371 mg, 1.51 mmol) obtained in Step 2 and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.128 ml, 1.66 mmol).
