EXAMPLE 4
5-(3-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme 1, compound 4)
Similarly to example 1.8, starting from 66 mg (0.5 mmol) of 3-fluorophenylboronic acid and 150 mg (0.3 mmol) of 5-bromo-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (prepared as described in example 2.5), 30 mg (20%) of 5-(3-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid with a melting point of 240Â° C.
