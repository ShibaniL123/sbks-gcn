Preparation of (1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl (S)-2-(4-(6-(aminomethyl)pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate dihydrochloride
Step 1: (1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl (S)-2-(4-(6-(((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)methyl)pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate
(1-Benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl (S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenyl-2-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)acetate (300 mg, 0.554 mmol), prepared as described in Procedure A Step 1-3, tert-butyl ((5-bromopyridin-2-yl)methyl)carbamate (106 mg, 0.369 mmol) and Na2CO3 (157 mg, 1.477 mmol) were mixed in toluene/ethanol/water (4.9 ml, 4:2:1). The mixture was degassed bubbling nitrogen inside the solution for 5 min before adding Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4)(42.7 mg, 0.037 mmol). The reaction mixture was irradiated by microwaves at 100° C. for 15 min×3 times. The mixture was diluted with Ethyl acetate and washed by water and brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to get a crude (1 g). The crude was dissolved in DMF (1 ml) and purified by reverse phase column chromatography (C18 cartridge, gradient elution from 100:0 to 0:100 A/B, A: water/MeCN 95:5+0.1% HCOOH, B: MeCN/water 95:5+0.1% HCOOH) to afford the title compound (122 mg, 53.1% yield) as a red oil.
