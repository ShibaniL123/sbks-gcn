EXAMPLE 45
5-(5-chloro-pyridin-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 45)
45.1: 1-benzhydryl-5-(5-chloro-pyridin-3-yl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione
Similarly to example 44.1, starting from 191 mg (1.2 mmol) of 5-chloropyridine-3-boronic acid and 300 mg (0.8 mmol) of 1-benzhydryl-5-bromo-3-methyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (prepared as described in example 2.2), 340 mg (96%) of 1-benzhydryl-5-(5-chloro-pyridin-3-yl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid.
