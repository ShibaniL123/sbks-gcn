Example 2-2 : Preparation of 3,5-dibromo-2-methoxypyrazine (X)
3,5-Dibromopyrazin-2-amine (IX) (1.0 g, 4.0 mmole) was dissolved in methanol (MeOH) (10 mL), and 2.5M HCl/MeOH solution (0.32 mL, 0.80 mmol) and isoamylnitrite (1.5 mL, 12 mmol) were added dropwise to the resulting solution and the solution was stirred with reflux for 2 hrs. The reaction solution was evaporated and concentrated under reduced pressure, diluted with dichloromethane, and washed with water. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-Hex/EA = 5/1) to give the title compound (500 mg, 47 %).
