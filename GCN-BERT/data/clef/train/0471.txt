Example 29. Preparation of 2-(4-(3-(N-phenylpentaneamido)prop-1-ynyl)phenoxy)acetic acid (LMT-891)
Step 1: Preparation of ethyl (2-(4-(3-(N-phenylpentaneamido)prop-1-ynyl)phenoxy)acetate
The N-(3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentaneamide (590 mg, 1.92 mmol) obtained in Example 28 and potassium carbonate (796 mg, 5.76 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (15 ml), and stirred for 30 minutes. Ethyl bromoacetate (0.23 ml, 2.11 mmol) was added to the mixture, and stirred at room temperature for 17 hours. The reaction solution was filtered to remove a solid and concentrated under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with water and brine. An organic solvent layer was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Hex:EA=10:1), thereby obtaining ethyl 2-(4-(3-(N-phenylpentaneamido)prop-1-ynyl)phenoxy)acetate (530 mg, 70% yield).
