Step 3: To N-[(4-(methoxyphenyl)methyl]-4-nitro-pyridin-2-amine (4.2g, 16.2 mmol) in toluene solution (10 mL) was added dropwise TFA (5.0 mL) at room tempreature. Then, the mixture was stirred at 80°C for reacting for 2 hours. TLC (PE:EA=1:1) showed that the reaction was completed. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The residue was diluted with H2O (50 mL) and pH thereof was adjusted with solid NaHCO3 to neutral. The water phase was extracted with EA (50 mL×3). The combined organic phase was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified through column chromatography (silicon dioxide, petroleum ether/ethyl acetate=1/0∼1:1) to give 4-nitropyridin-2-amine (700 mg, 5.0 mmol, 31.1% yield) as an orange solid compound.
