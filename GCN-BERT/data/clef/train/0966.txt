Example 36. (R)-3-((3-((cyclopropylmethyl)(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile
62.0 mg of (R)-N-(cyclopropylmethyl)-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.20 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 50.4 mg of 3-cyanobenzenesulfonyl chloride was added to the solution, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0420 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and then stirred at room temperature for about 1 hour. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=0:100→1:80→1:50). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 62.2 mg of (R)-3-((3-((cyclopropylmethyl)(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile was obtained with a yield of about 61.0%.
