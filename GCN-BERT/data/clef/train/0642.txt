Example 19. 4-Amino-5-cyano-6-((1-(8-chloro-1-methyl-4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrimidine
Step 1. Preparation of tert-butyl (1-(8-Chloro-4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)ethyl) carbamate
3-(1-Aminoethyl)-8-chloro-2-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one (1.5g, 0.005mol) obtained in step 8 of Example 9 and 20ml of THF were added to a 100ml three-necked flask and stirred to be dissolved. 10ml 1M sodium hydroxide solution was added and the temperature was reduced to 0Â°C. A solution of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (1.38g, 0.006mol) in 5ml of tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. The reaction was stopped and tetrahydrofuran was removed by spin evaporation. 50ml of water and 50ml of ethyl acetate were added to the residue, and the aqueous layer was extracted with 25 ml x 2 ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined, washed with saturated salt water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. Column chromatography was performed to give 1.65g of a white solid with a yield of 82.8%.
