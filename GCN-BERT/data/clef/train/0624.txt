(3) Preparation of spiro[3.3]heptane-2-amine
2-(spiro[3.3]heptan-2-yl)isoindolin-1,3-dione (1.56 g, 6.47 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (30 mL), hydrazine hydrate (1.88 g, 30 mmol, 80%) was added, reacted at 20Â°C for 6h. After completion of the reaction, the reaction solution was suck filtrated, concentrated in vacuum, ethyl acetate (150 mL) was added, washed with water (100 mL), the organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated in vacuum, the crude product was separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate =3:1) to obtain product (561 mg, yield 78.1 %).
