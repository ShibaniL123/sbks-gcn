Step C: 5-(Trifluoromethyl)-3a,7a-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine. To a solution of 1-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-3a,7a-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridin-1-yl)ethan-1-one (1.30 g, 5.68 mmol) in MeOH (19 mL) and H2O (1.2 mL) was added K2CO3 (1.27 g, 9.20 mmol). The reaction was stirred at rt for 30 min, and then heated to 50Â° C. for 1 h. After cooling to rt, the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue suspended in EtOAc. The suspension was washed with H2O, and the organic layer was then dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude solid was triturated in a mixture of DCM/hexanes to afford the title compound as a yellow solid (930 mg, 87% yield).
