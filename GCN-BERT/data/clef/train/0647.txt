Step 2: Preparation of 1-(4-chloro-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-yl)-2-fluoroethane-1-one
3.8 g (9.360 mmol) of 5-(1-((tert-butyldimethylsylyl)oxy)vinyl)-6-chloro-N-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrimidine-4-amine prepared in step 1 was dissolved in 40 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile, to which 3.65 g (10.300 mmol) of 1-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-1, 4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octanebis(tetrafluoroborate) (selectfluor) was added, followed by stirring at room temperature for 15 hours. Ethyl acetate and water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethylacetate, 4/1) to give 2.5 g of the target compound 1-(4-chloro-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-yl)-2-fluoroethane-1-one as a white liquid (8.072 mmol, yield: 86%).
