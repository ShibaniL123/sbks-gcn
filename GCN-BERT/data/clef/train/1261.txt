Step 4. (4-(Benzyloxycarbonylamino)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-1-yl)methyl methanesulfonate
To a solution of benzyl 4-(hydroxymethyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-1-yl)carbamate (200 mg, 0.73 mmol) and triethylamine (0.51 mL, 3.63 mmol) in DCM (3.0 mL) at 0Â° C. was added methanesulfonyl chloride (0.11 mL, 1.45 mmol) dropwise. After stirring at this temperature for 15 min, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stir for 2 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated NaHCO3 and diluted with DCM. The layers were separated and the organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the product as a colorless oil (252 mg, 98%).
