Synthesis Example 1-(6): Synthesis of Intermediate 1-f
Intermediate 1-f was synthesized as illustrated in the following Reaction Scheme 6:
In a 2-L round-bottom flask reactor, Intermediate 1-e (60.0 g, 0.326 mol) was dissolved in methylene chloride (600 ml) and slowed added with pyridine (38.7 g, 0.489 mol) before stirring at room temperature for 30 min. The solution was cooled to 0Â° C. and added with drops of trifluoromethane sulfonyl anhydride (137.8 g, 0.489 mol) at the same temperature. After 5 hrs of stirring at room temperature, the reaction solution was added with water (100 ml) and stirred again for 10 min. Extraction with water and ethyl acetate formed an organic layer which was then isolated and concentrated in a vacuum. Purification through column chromatography afforded Intermediate 1-f.
