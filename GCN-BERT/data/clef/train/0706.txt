Synthesis Example 1-3: Synthesis of [Intermediate 1-c]
In a round-bottom flask, Intermediate 1-b (27 g, 89.2 mmol) and phosphoric acid (70 ml) were stirred together at room temperature for 12 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was extracted, concentrated, and separated by column chromatography to afford Intermediate 1-c (17.6 g): yield 70%
