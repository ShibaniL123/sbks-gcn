Synthesis of compound 3-b
At 0Â°C, under N2 atmosphere, potassium tert-butanolate (71mg, 0.63mmol) was added to a solution of methyl(methylthiomethyl)sulfoxide (78mg, 0.63mmol) in anhydrous THF (5mL). The mixture was stirred for 30mins, followed by adding compound 2-d (100mg, 0.42mmol), stirred for 1h at room temperature, then evaporated under reduced pressure. 2M HCl in methanol (5mL) was added to the residue, the mixture was refluxed for 3hrs, then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified with silica column chromatography (PE:EA = 5:1) to give compound 3-b (70 mg, yield 60%).
