[Reaction Scheme 1-11] Synthesis of [Intermediate 1-k]
In a 2-L reactor, Intermediate 1-j (45.0 g, 232 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (450 mL) were placed and stirred together. The temperature was lowered to 0° C., and drops of 3M-phenyl magnesium bromide (88.2 mL, 487 mmol) were added, followed by refluxing for 3 hours. A solution of ethyl chloroformate (44.3 g, 732 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) was dropwise added and then refluxed for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0° C. and added with an aqueous saturated ammonium chloride solution. The organic layer was then extracted and concentrated at a reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography afforded Intermediate 1-k (46 g): yield 80%
