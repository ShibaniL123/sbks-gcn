Preparation of trans-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-N-(4-((2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-methylphenyl)benzamide (F1130)
4 M Hydrogen chloride in 1,4-dioxane (0.370 mL, 1.479 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of trans-2-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)(4-(2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamido)-3-methylphenyl)amino)ethyl acetate (F1129) (0.110 g, 0.148 mmol) in dichloromethane (5 mL). The resulting suspension of solid was stirred for 12 hours at 23° C. and then quenched with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (5 mL). The aqueous mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×5 mL) and the organic extract was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (5 mL) and concentrated under vacuum on a rotary evaporator. Purification by silica gel flash chromatography gave the title compound as a pale yellow foam (0.050 g, 53%).
