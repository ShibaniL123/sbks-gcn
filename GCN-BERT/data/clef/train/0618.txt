Example 65C
ethyl (2S,3S,4S,5S)-1-(bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-6-carbonyl)-3-(tert-butyl)-4-((2-methoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl)amino)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate
Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-6-carboxylic acid (29.4 mg, 0.233 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (1 mL). Oxalyl chloride (40 μL, 0.457 mmol) was added followed by N,N-dimethylformamide (10 μL). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, at which point it was concentrated, redissolved in dichloromethane (1 mL), and concentrated again. The residue was taken up in dichloromethane (2×1 mL) and added to (2S,3S,4S,5S)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-4-((2-methoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl)amino)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Example 65B) (54.7 mg, 0.114 mmol) and triethylamine (50 μL, 0.359 mmol) in dichloromethane (1 mL). The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 17 hours. The reaction was concentrated and the crude residue was purified by reverse phase using the ammonium acetate method to provide the title compound (64.9 mg, 97%).
