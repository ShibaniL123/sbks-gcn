Example 17. Preparation of DPAG-2
50 mL flask was charged with 2-hydroxy-2-trifluoromethylacetophenone (SM-9) (0.98 g, 4.80 mmol, 2.0 eq.) and THF (12 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −30° C. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 3.0 mL, 4.80 mmol, 2.0 eq.) was added drop-wise to the mixture over 10 minutes and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at −30° C. This solution was added to a cold (−30° C.) solution of 2,2'-(1,3-phenylenebis(azanediyl))bis(1,1-difluoro-2-oxoethane-1-sulfonyl fluoride) (SM-8, 1.03 g, 2.40 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in THF (12 mL) over 5 minutes and the mixture was then stirred for 3 hours at −30 to 10° C. 1N HCl (24 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then Et2O (72 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (24 mL) and the lower layer was extracted with Et2O (48 mL) and then the organic layers were combined. This solution was washed with brine (24 mL) twice and was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and then CHCl3 (100 mL) was added to the residue. An insoluble solid was filtrated off and the filtrate was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (20 mL) four times and then the lower layer was separated and concentrated in the evaporator. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (Hexane/CH2Cl2) and (Hexane/AcOEt) to obtain the target PAG as white solid (0.09 g) in 4.9% yield.
