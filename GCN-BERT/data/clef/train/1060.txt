Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(6-bromo-4-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl) methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
A solution of sodium nitrite (0.045 g, 0.65 mmol) in water (0.75 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of (1S,3R)-1-(6-bromo-4-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (0.270 g, 0.62 mmol) in propionic acid (3.0 mL) at −15° C. (salt/ice bath), and the reaction was stirred under these conditions 1 hour. Ice-cold EtOAc (10 mL) was added followed by saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (15 mL) portionwise. The layers were separated, and the organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2×). The combined aqueous layers (pH=8) were extracted with EtOAc, and then all combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica flash chromatography, elution gradient 20 to 60% ethyl acetate in hexanes to give (6S,8R)-6-(6-bromo-4-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (0.11 g, 41%) as a gum.
