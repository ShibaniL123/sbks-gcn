Step 3 : preparation of intermediate tert butyl (2S,4S,5S)-5-(allyloxyamino)-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silylloxymethyll-4-hydroxy-piperidine-1-carboxylate (4c)
To a solution of tert-butyl (1S,3S,6R)-3-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-7-oxa-4-azabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane-4-carboxylate (4b) (4.35 g, 12.69 mmol) in anhydrous MeOH (25.4 mL) under inert atmosphere was added O-allylhydroxylamine (5.45g, 63.45 mmol). The reactor was sealed and the reaction was stirred 3 days at 80Â°C. MeOH was evaporated and the residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (Cyclohexane/EtOAc: from 90/10 to 0/100) to provide tert-butyl (2S,4S,5S)-5-(allyloxyamino)-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-hydroxy-piperidine-1-carboxylate (4c) (3.47 g, 8.32 mmol, 65%) as a colorless oil and starting material (4b) (1.05 g, 3.06 mmol).
