Example 9
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-Î±-[N-(2-sulphoethyl)carbamoyl]-4-hydroxybenzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine ammonium salt
The title compound was synthesized using the procedure of Example 3 starting from 1,1 -dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-carboxymethoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Method 3; 43mg, 0.085mmol). The solvent was evaporated after 3 hours and the crude product was purified by preparative HPLC (C8 column, 50x250mm) using a gradient (40/60 to 60/40) of MeCN/0.1M ammonium acetate buffer as eluent. Lyophilization yielded 38mg (57% yield) of the title compound NMR (400MHz): 0.8 (t, 6H), 1.0-1.2 (m, 6H), 1.25-1.4 (m, 2H), 1.4-1.5 (m, 2H), 1.55-1.7 (m, 2H), 2.1 (s, 3H), 2.8-3.0 (m, 2H), 3.55-3.7 (m, 2H), 3.95 (brs, 2H), 4.6 (ABq, 2H), 5.35 (s, 1H), 6.6 (s, 1H), 6.75 (d, 2H), 7.05 (t, 1H) 7.15-7.4 (m, 7H), 8.15 (t, 1H); m/z: 763.
