Example 3: Preparation of 3,7-dimethoxy-N-((2-methoxy)ethoxy)ethyl-phenothiazine
3,7-dibromo-N-((2-methoxy)ethoxy)ethylphenothiazine
N-((2-methoxy)ethoxy)ethylphenothiazine (1.12 g, 3.73 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (DCM) (11 mL) in a round-bottomed flask. The reaction mixture was cooled in an ice bath and N-bromosuccinimide (2.0 g, 11.2 mmol) was added portion-wise over 10 minutes. The reaction was allowed to stir at 0Â° C. for 30 min. Upon completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was quenched with sodium thiosulfate, diluted with DCM, and then the organic layer washed with water and brine. The organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The organic residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using 40% ethyl acetate in hexane as eluent to afford the product as a pale red syrup (1.03 g) in 60% yield.
