Step 2. Synthesis of Methyl 3-(1-(3,5-Dimethyl-4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethyl)benzoate (IF4a)
To a solution of compound IF3a (100 mg, 0.56 mmol), 3,5-dimethyl-4-nitropyrazole (86 mg, 0.61 mmol) and PPh3 (176 mg, 0.67 mmol) in THF (40 mL) was slowly added DEAD (116 mg, 0.67 mmol) and the mixture was allowed to stir at rt for 12 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated NH4Cl (50 mL) and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The organic phase was washed with water and brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford IF4a as a colorless oil (50 mg, 29%).
