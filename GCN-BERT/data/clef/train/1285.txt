Step 2 Synthesis of Compound 137
To Compound 136 (90 mg, 176 Âµmol) in tetrahydrofuran (3 mL) solution was added 0.5 mol/L tetrabutylammonium hydroxide aqueous solution (3.42 mL, 1.76 mmol), the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Water was added thereto, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain Compound 137 (45 mg, 48% yield) as colorless foam.
