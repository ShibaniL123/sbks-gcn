Step 1. (R)-2-Methyl-N-(8-deutero-1, 4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)propane-2-sulfinamide
A mixture of 1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decan-8-one (2.5 g, 16 mmol), (R)-(+)-2-methyl-2-propanesulfinamide (1.9 g, 16 mmol), and titanium(IV) ethoxide (6.7 ml, 32 mmol) in THF (32 mL) was heated at reflux for 2 h. After cooling to rt, the reaction mixture was added dropwise via cannula to a suspension of sodium borodeuteride (2.0 g, 48 mmol) (Aldrich, 205591) in THF (12 mL) at −44° C. The original flask, which had contained the reaction mixture from the imine condensation, was rinsed with THF (2×6 mL), and this mixture was added dropwise to the flask containing the sodium borodeuteride reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was then allowed to warm to rt, stirring for 3 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0° C., and the reaction quenched by dropwise addition of methanol (13 mL, 320 mmol). After stirring for 10 min, the mixture was warmed to rt while stirring 30 min. The mixture was then diluted with EtOAc (80 mL) and poured into brine (5 mL). The resulting slurry was stirred rapidly for 20 min. The slurry was filtered through Celite, rinsing the filter cake generously with EtOAc. The filtrate was then concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (3-7% MeOH in DCM) afforded the title compound as a white solid (3.8 g, 90%).
