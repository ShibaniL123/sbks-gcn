EXAMPLE 10
3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-5-phenyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme 1, compound 10)
Similarly to example 1.8, starting from 61 mg (0.5 mmol) of phenylboronic acid and 160 mg (0.3 mmol) of 5-bromo-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (prepared as described in example 2.5), 110 mg (70%) of 3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-5-phenyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid with a melting point of 220Â° C.
