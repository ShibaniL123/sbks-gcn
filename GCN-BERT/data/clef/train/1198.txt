Step 4: Synthesis of 2-(3-chlorophenyl)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine
Into a 200 mL three-neck flask were added 10 g (37 mmol) of 2-chloro-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine, 5.8 g (37 mmol) of 3-chlorophenylboronic acid, and 7.8 g (74 mmol) of sodium carbonate, and the atmosphere in the flask was replaced with nitrogen. To the mixture were added 150 mL of toluene, 35 mL of ethanol, and 37 mL of water, and the resulting mixture was degassed by being stirred while the pressure was reduced. After the degasification, 0.43 g (0.37 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) was added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture was stirred at approximately 80Â° C. for 3 hours. After the stirring, the aqueous layer of this mixture was subjected to extraction with toluene, and the solution of the obtained extract and the organic layer were combined and washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride. The obtained organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate. This mixture was gravity-filtered, and the obtained filtrate was concentrated to give a solid. The obtained solid was dissolved in approximately 30 mL of hot toluene, and this solution was subjected to suction filtration through Celite, alumina, and Florisil. A solid obtained by concentration of the obtained filtrate was washed with methanol, and the solid was collected by suction filtration to give 11 g of a target white solid in a yield of 86%. The synthesis scheme of Step 4 is shown in (a-4) below.
