Example 56A
Methyl 4-{[(6-cyclopropyl-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
70 mg (0.23 mmol) of the compound from Example 16A were initially charged in 1.0 ml of DMF. Successively, 61 mg (0.28 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, 132 mg (0.35 mmol) of HATU and 0.16 ml (0.92 mmol) of DIPEA were added to the solution, and the mixture was subsequently stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, the mixture, without further work-up, was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 68 mg (60% of theory, purity 95%) of the title compound
