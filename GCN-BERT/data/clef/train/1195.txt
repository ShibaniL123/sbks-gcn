Example 73: Synthesis of compound 11339, N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)acetamide
[Step 1] Synthesis of methyl 4-(bromomethyl)-3-fluorobenzoate
Methyl 3-fluoro-4-methylbenzoate (8.500 g, 50.544 mmol), 1-bromopyrolidin-2,5-one (NBS, 9.446 g, 53.071 mmol) and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, 0.415 g, 2.527 mmol) were mixed in dichloromethane (150 mL) at room temperature, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 18 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 40 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 50%) and concentrated to give the title compound (7.600 g, 60.9%) as a white solid.
