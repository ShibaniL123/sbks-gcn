Step 1-7: 1-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-3-(4-methyl-3-(1-methyl-7-((6-methylpyridin-3-yl)amino)-2-oxo-1,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidin-3(2H)-yl)phenyl)urea (Compound No. 1)
3-(5-Amino-2-methylphenyl)-1-methyl-7-((6-methylpyridin-3-yl)amino)-3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one (40 mg, 0.11 mmol) was dissolved in THF (2.2 mL), 2-methoxyphenyl isocyanate (0.02 mL, 0.14 mmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. After 1 hour, when the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane and water, and the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography to obtain the desired compound (25.3 mg, 43.8%) as a white solid.
