Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorobenzyl)-4-{3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl}pyrrolidin-2-one (Compound 64)
(64-1) Synthesis of 1-[(4-chlorophenyl)methyl]-5-pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid (Compound 64-1)
A mixture of itaconic acid (1.3 g, 10 mmol) and p-chlorobenzylamine (1.28 ml, 11 mmol) was stirred at 120 Â°C for 4 hours. Thereafter, the solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the obtained crystals were washed with a mixed solution of acetic acid and hexane (1:9) to obtain the title compound (2.3 g, yield 92%).
