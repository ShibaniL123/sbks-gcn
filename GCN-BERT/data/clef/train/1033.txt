To the stirred solution of 2-(4,4-diethoxy-butyl)-isoindole-1,3-dione (22 g, 75.6 mmol, 1 eq) in acetone (160 mL) was added 1N aqueous HCl (145 mL) and the reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 2 h. After completion of the reaction, it was concentrated under reduced pressure and diluted with EtOAc and washed with water and brine. The combined organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered to get the desired 4-(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl)-butyraldehyde (13 g, 96% yield) as white solid.
