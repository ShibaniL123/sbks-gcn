Example 31
Synthesis of 3-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)-1-methylpyridin-2(1H)-one hydrochloride
To a 10-mL test tube, 3-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4, 5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)-1-methylpyridin-2(1H)-one (26 mg, 54 µmol) synthesized in Example 6, and ethyl acetate were added. The resulting mixture was extracted with 1 N hydrochloric acid, and the aqueous layer was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was dried at 60°C for 1 hour under reduced pressure to obtain the title compound (23 mg, 83%) as pale yellow amorphous substance.
