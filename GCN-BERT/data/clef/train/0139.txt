Step 6: Preparation of (S)-4-((1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethyl)amino)-6-fluoro-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
4 mg (0.013 mmol) of 4-chloro-6-fluoro-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one prepared in step 5 and 4 mg (0.014 mmol) of (S)-3-(1-aminoethyl)-8-chloro-2-phenylisoquinoline-1(2H)-one were dissolved in 1 mL of anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), to which 6.6 μL (0.039 mmol) of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) was added, followed by stirring at 70° C. for 5 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature. Ethyl acetate and water were added thereto, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 4/1-hexane/ethyl acetate, 1/1) to give 6 mg of the target compound (S)-4-((1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethyl)amino)-6-fluoro-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one as a pale yellow solid (0.010 mmol, yield: 82%).
