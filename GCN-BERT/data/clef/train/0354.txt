Step 3
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahy drobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
N-(1-(benzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine 4c (50 mg, 0.2 mmol), (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-formylphenyl) acrylate 1e (90 mg, 0.4 mmol, prepared by a method disclosed in the patent application "WO2014191726") and triisopropylsilyl chloride (193 mg, 1 mmol) were dissolved in 2 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide and placed in a sealed tube. The reaction mixture was heated to 130Â°C. After stirring for 3 hours, the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahy drobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 4d (15 mg, yield 16%) as a white solid.
