Example 13. (R)-N-methyl-N-(1-((1-methyl-1H-imidazole-4-yl)sulfonyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine
50.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.00 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 39.7 mg of 1-methyl-1H-imidazole-4-sulfonyl chloride was added thereto, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0370 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and then stirred at room temperature for about 1 hour. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=0:100→1:80→1:50). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 17.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(1-((1-methyl-1H-imidazole-4-yl)sulfonyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 22.4%.
