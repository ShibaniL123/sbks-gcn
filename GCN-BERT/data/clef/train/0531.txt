Step 5 Synthesis of compound I-064
To a solution of the compound 64g (320 mg, 0.448 mmol) in dichloromethane (6.5 mL), anisole (0.392 mL, 3.59 mmol) and a 2 mol/L solution of aluminum chloride in nitromethane (1.79 mL, 3.59 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at -30°C to -26°C for 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture was dissolved in ice water, 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid, and acetonitrile. Then, the solution was washed by diisopropyl ether. HP20-SS resin was added to the aqueous layer. Acetonitrile was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained mixed solution was purified by ODS column chromatography (water-acetonitrile). Fractions containing the desired compound were mixed. Under ice cooling, a 0.2 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (1.3 mL) was slowly added dropwise to the mixture. When the pH reached 4.78, a small piece of dry ice was added to the mixture so that the pH became 4.37. This mixed solution was concentrated under reduced pressure and then freeze-dried to afford the compound I-064 (185 mg, 73%).
