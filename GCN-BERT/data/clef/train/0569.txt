Example 161A
1-[2,6-Dioxo-1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-(pyridinium-1-yl)-1,6-dihydropyrimidin-5 (2H)-ylidene] 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxide
At RT, 16.1 ml (199 mmol) of pyridine were added to a suspension of 5.0 g (19.9 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 159A in 50 ml of acetonitrile. 11.3 ml (79.8 mmol) of trifluoroacetic anhydride were then slowly added dropwise. After the addition had ended, the mixture was stirred at RT for about another 45 min. Subsequently, about 500 ml of water were added and the mixture was extracted three times with about 500 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic extract was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. Then the solid, which was finely suspended in the extract, was filtered off with suction and washed with a little ethyl acetate. The solid was dried under high vacuum and gave a first fraction of the title compound (4.22 g, 54% of theory). The filtrate obtained was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated down to a residual volume of about 30 ml. The precipitated solid was filtered off with suction again and dried under high vacuum and gave a second fraction of the title compound (2.63 g, 33% of theory). A total of 6.85 g (88% of theory) of the title compound were thus obtained.
