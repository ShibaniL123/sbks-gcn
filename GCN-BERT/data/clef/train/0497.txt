Step 1. 5-(Benzyloxy)-4-fluoro-6-iodo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one
To a mixture of 4-fluoro-5-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one (2.017 g, 12.14 mmol) and NIS (2.742 g, 12.19 mmol) was added DMF (30.0 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Benzyl bromide (2.820 g, 16.49 mmol) was added followed by K2CO3 (5.088 g, 36.8 mmol). The reaction was stirred at 80Â° C. for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was diluted with Et2O and washed with brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (120 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as a yellow solid (2.36 g, 51%).
