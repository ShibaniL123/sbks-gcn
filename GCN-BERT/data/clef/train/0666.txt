Step 2. 3-(8-Amino-6-bromoimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-yl)-N-((3, 3-difluorocyclobutyl)methyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide
A mixture of 6-bromo-3-iodoimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine (120 mg, 0.35 mmol, 3N Br I), N-((3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)methyl)-4-methyl-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide (156 mg, 0.389 mmol), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (24.96 mg, 0.022 mmol) in ethanol (4 mL)/2.0 M sodium carbonate in water (0.35 mL) was degassed for 5 min with N2. The reaction mixture was then heated in a microwave reactor at 130° C. for 20 min. The reaction mixture was diluted with MeOH and filtered through a plug of Celite®. The filtrate was concentrated and the residue was purified by flash chromatography (0-100% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the title compound (170 mg, 99%).
