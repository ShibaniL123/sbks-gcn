Step 2. 3-(8-Amino-6-ethylimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-yl)-N-(trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide
To a solution of 3-(8-amino-6-vinylimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-yl)-N-(trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (8 mg, 0.02 mmol) in ethanol (4 mL) under N2 was added wet 10% Pd/C (8 mg, Ëœ50% H2O) [Sigma-Aldrich, 330108]. The reaction mixture was then placed under an atm of H2 and stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite, the Celite plug was rinsed with MeOH, and the filtrate was concentrated. Purification via preparative HPLC on a C-18 column (pH 10, 23-40% MeCN/0.1% NH4OH (aq) over 5 min, 60 mL/min) afforded the title compound as a white solid (5 mg, 60%).
