Method 10
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-α-[(S)-2-(t-butoxycarbonyl) pyrrolidin-1-ylcarboyl]benzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-[N-((R)-α-carboxybenzyl) carbamoylmethoxy]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Example 25; 50 mg, 0.078 mmol) and tert-butyl L-prolinate (15 mg, 0.088 mmol) were dissolved in DCM (2ml) and N-methylmorpholine (17.2µl, 0.156 mmol) and TBTU (45 mg, 0.14 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 hours then additional tert-butyl L-prolinate (15 mg, 0.088 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred over night. The reaction mixture was put directly on an Isolute column (2g, silica). The product was eluted with a stepwise gradient using DCM:EtOAc 100:0,95:5,90:10 then 80:20 to give the title compound (41 mg, 66%). M/z 793.2.
