(E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(1-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-met hyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(1-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 20a (3.2 g, 6.255 mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL of methanol, then 3 mL of 6 M sodium hydroxide solution was added. After stirring for 12 hours, the reaction was stopped. 1M hydrochloric acid was added dropwise until the pH of the reaction solution was acidic. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(1-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-met hyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid 20 (1.5 g, yield 48%) as a yellow solid.
