Example 6: Preparation of sodium (2S,5R)-2-((2-methyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate (Compound 6) (Method II)
(1) Preparation of sodium (2S,5R)-2-((2-methyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate
(2S,5R)-2-((2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl) carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate (46.0 g, 0.127 mol, its preparation method could be referred to Example 2) was added to water (460 mL), and to this system, an aqueous solution of formaldehyde (51.53 g, 0.635 mol), methanol (65 mL) and Pd/C (4.6 g) were added, the system was purged with hydrogen gas for 3 times, and reacted at 25Â°C for 48h, the completion of reaction was determined by analyzing raw materials with HPLC. The reaction solution was filtrated, the filtrate was concentrated to have a residue of about 90 mL, and the filtrate was then dropped into isopropanol (1380 mL) to precipitate solid, after filtration, the filter cake was washed with anhydrous methanol (100 mL) to obtain the title compound (26 g, yield was 54.4 %).
