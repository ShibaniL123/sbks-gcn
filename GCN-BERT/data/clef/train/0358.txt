Step 5
The compound 58 (70.0 mg, 0.22 mmol) and the compound 59 (39.0 mg, 0.286 mmol) were dissolved in dioxane (2 mL). The solution was stirred at 80Â°C for 1.5 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate-n-hexane) to give the compound I-1138 (25.1 mg, yield 27%).
