6-(2-chlorobutanoyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.80 g, 3.18 mmol), thiourea (0.25 g, 3.34 mmol) and triethylamine (0.66 mL, 4.77 mmol) suspended in anhydrous ethanol (12 ml) in a sealed tube under argon atmosphere. The sealed tube was microwaved at 120Â° C. for 45 min. The brown precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with cold ethanol. The residue was dried loaded onto silica and purified by flash chromatography over silica gel with CH2Cl2:MeOH (95:5) to give 6-(2-amino-5-ethylthiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.27 g, 29%) as a light brown solid.
