3-Ethyl-6-{[(3R)-3-hydroxy-2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl]methyl}-1-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
To a solution of 106 mg (0.673 mmol) of [(4R)-2,2-dimethyl-5-oxo-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]acetaldehyde [Int. Pat. Appl. WO 2012/037393-A1, Preparation B/Step B] in 6.7 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane were added 200 mg (0.673 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 200A and 23 Î¼l (0.404 mmol) of acetic acid. After 15 min, at RT, a total of 225 mg (1.01 mmol) of sodium triacetoxyborohydride was added in three portions. After the reaction mixture had been stirred at RT for about 18 h, it was admixed with saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic extract was washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The remaining residue was purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8). After concentration of the product fractions and drying under high vacuum, 63 mg (24% of theory, 98% purity, 99% ee) of the title compound were obtained.
