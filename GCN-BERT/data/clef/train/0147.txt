(Reference Example 4) Synthesis of 4-Trifluoromethylfuroxan Compound Using 4-Fluorofuroxan Compound as Starting Compound
4-Fluoro-3-(4-methylphenyl)furoxan (38.8 mg) and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethane (0.089 mL) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (0.45 mL), and a solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran (1 M, 0.01 mL) was slowly added dropwise thereto. After stirring the mixture for 1 hour, the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain 11.9 mg (16% yield) of 4-trifluoromethyl-3-(4-methylphenyl)furoxan.
