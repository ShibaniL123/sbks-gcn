Step 1. 3-((3-Bromo-4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)-3-methylbutan-2-one
To a mixture of 1-((3-bromo-4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)propan-2-one (70 mg, 0.24 mmol) (from Example 496, Step 1) and potassium carbonate (73 mg, 0.53 mmol) in DMF (2.4 mL) was added iodomethane (37 μL, 0.60 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 2 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with water, and the aqueous mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3×). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (1-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (42 mg, 55%).
