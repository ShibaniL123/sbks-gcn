A magnetically-stirred solution of (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-(benzylamino)-1-methylcyclopentanol (2a, 100 g, 487 mmol) and EtOH (700 mL) in a 1 L flask was heated in an 80° C. oil bath for 30 min. A separate 5 L, three-neck flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, internal thermometer, and water-cooled condenser was charged with (2S)-[(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)amino](phenyl)ethanoic acid (CAS#74927-72-3, 84.1 g, 244 mmol, 0.5 equiv) and EtOH (1.4 L). This flask was also heated in an 80° C. oil bath with stirring until the solid dissolved, ˜15 min, and stirring continued for another 30 min. The hot solution of amine 2a from the first flask was poured via funnel, in a steady flow over 1 min, into the hot, mechanically stirred solution of chiral acid in the second flask. The transfer was quantitated with EtOH (10 mL). The reaction mixture remained clear for about 1 min, then precipitation began. After 5 min, a thick white suspension had formed, but did not hinder mechanical stirring. Stirring was continued at 80° C. for 4 h, then heating was discontinued and the mixture was stirred while gradually cooling to room temperature overnight. The resulting solid was collected by filtration, washed with EtOH (350 mL), and dried in a vacuum oven (10 mmHg, 40° C.) for 1.5 days, affording (1R,2R)-N-benzyl-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentanaminium (2S)-[(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)amino](phenyl)acetate (2b-RR, 110.22 g, 82%) as a white solid.
