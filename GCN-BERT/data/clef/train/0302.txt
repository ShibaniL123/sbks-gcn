Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-[3-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-4-(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one (Compound 73)
(73-1) Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (Compound 73-1)
To a solution of acetyl chloride (0.2 g, 2.5 mmol) in methanol (30 mL) was added 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid (12 g, 50 mmol) and methyl orthoformate (5.3 g, 50 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 64 Â°C for 1.5 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was recrystallized from ethanol to obtain the title compound 8.2 g (yield 65%).
