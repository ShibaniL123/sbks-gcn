Step 3: 4-benzyl-7-bromo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro(2,2-d2)-1,4-benzoxazepin-5-one
To a solution of N-benzyl-5-bromo-2-fluoro-N-[2-hydroxy(2,2-d2)ethyl]benzamide [Example 3, Step 2] (7.8 g, 22.02 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in DMF (50 mL) was added sodium hydride (1.15 g, 1.30 equiv). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of H2O (10 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3Ã—50 mL). The organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by SiO2 chromatography eluted with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (9:1) to afford 4 g (54%) of 4-benzyl-7-bromo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro(2,2-d2)-1,4-benzoxazepin-5-one as light yellow oil.
