Example 10: synthesis of [5-(3-aminopropyl)-4,9-dioxo-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-en-10-yl] hydrogen sulfate
Step 1: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl 3-[3-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxypropyl]-2,7-dioxo-4,6-dihydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (10a)
To a solution of tert-butyl 2,7-dioxo-4,6-dihydro-3H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3e) (1.50 g, 5.55 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (55 mL) under inert atmosphere were added K2CO3 (0.81 g, 5.83 mmol) and (3-bromopropoxy)-tert-butyldimethylsilane (1.35 mL, 5.83 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 70Â°C overnight. Water was added and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc twice. The organic layers were combined, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was purified twice by flash chromatography on silica gel (petroleum ether/acetone 100/0 to 80/20 then heptane/acetone 100/0 to 60/40) to provide tert-butyl 3-[3-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxypropyl]-2,7-dioxo-4,6-dihydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (10a) (1.53 g, 3.46 mmol, 62%).
