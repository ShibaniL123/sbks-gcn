Step 2
4,4'-(((2,2'-Dimethyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(oxy))bis(3-hydroxybenzaldehyde (27)
To a stirred solution of 3,3'-bis(bromomethyl)-2,2'-dimethylbiphenyl 21 (1 g, 2.732 mmol) in ACN (25 mL) at room temperature were added K2CO3 (1.5 g, 10.928 mmol) and 5-formyl-2-hydroxyphenyl acetate (2.4 g, 13.661 mmol) and stirred at 90Â° C. for 4 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to remove most of the solvent. The residue was poured into ice-water and the resulting precipitate was filtered and dried in vacuum to get 4,4'-(((2,2'-dimethyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(oxy))bis(3-hydroxybenzaldehyde) 27 (1.1 g, yield: 83%, LC-MS 60%), [C30H26O6],
