Step 2
2-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2 -yl)pyridine
5-bromo-2-(1-metbyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridine 61c (0.12 g, 0.504 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL of 1,4-dioxane, then bis(pinacolato)diboron (0.192 g, 0.756 mmol), [1,1'-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichlorophalladium (II) (22.13 mg, 0.0302 mmol) and potassium acetate (0.15 g, 1.528 mmol) were added. The reaction was warmed up to 85Â°C and stirred for 12 hours . After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound 2-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)pyridine 61d (35 mg, yield 24%) as a yellow oil.
