Step 2: Preparation of tert-butyl 4-(4-bromobenzoyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate
4-bromobenzoic acid (901 mg, 4.48 mmol) and tert-butyl piperazine-1-carboxylate (1.00 g, 5.37 mmol) were diluted in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 15 ml), and stirred for 5 minutes. 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate (HATU; 2.04 g, 5.37 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA; 2.34 ml, 13.44 mmol) were added to the mixture, and stirred at room temperature for 15 hours. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue obtained thereby was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with water and brine. An organic solvent layer was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Hex:EA=2:1), thereby obtaining tert-butyl 4-(4-bromobenzoyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (1.56 g, 94% yield).
