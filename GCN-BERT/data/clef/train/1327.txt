Step 4. 5-Chloro-1-trityl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine-6-carbonitrile
To a solution of 6-cyano-1-trityl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine 4-oxide (447.3 mg, 1.1 mmol) in DCM (10.0 ml) at 0° C. was added Et3N (264.9 mg, 2.62 mmol) followed by the dropwise addition of a solution of oxalyl chloride (317.6 mg, 2.5 mmol) in DCM (3.0 ml). After stirring at 0° C. for 30 min, the mixture was diluted with DCM and washed with sat. NaHCO3. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (40 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as a white foamy solid (446.7 mg, 95%).
