(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((5S,7R/5R,7S)-6-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-2,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrooxazolo[5,4-g]isoquinolin-5-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((5S,7R/5R,7S)-6-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-2,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrooxazolo[5,4-g]isoquinolin-5-yl)phenyl)acrylate 80c (20 mg, 0.042 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol, then sodium hydroxide (17 mg, 0.423 mmol) was added. The reaction solution was warmed up to 30°C and stirred for 1 hour reaction at 30°C. 1 M of HCl was added to adjust the pH to 5. The reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((5S,7R/5R,7S)-6-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-2,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrooxazolo[5,4-g]isoquinolin-5-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid 80 (4 mg, yield 20%) as a white solid.
