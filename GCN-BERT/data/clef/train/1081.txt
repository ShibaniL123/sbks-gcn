Compound 5 (1.512 g, 4.47 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (80 mL). Tetrabutylammonium fluoride (7.13g, 27.29mmol) was added at room temperature. The reaction system was stirred at 65 Â°C for 2 hours, and then the reaction solution was evaporated and purified by silicagel column to obtain compound 6 (1.208 g, 79.89%) as a yellow oil.
