Example 1: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.sesquiphosphate
Methanol solution (33.27 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (3.13 g: 24.8 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and phosphoric acid (85% in water) (4.31 g: 37.4 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60째 C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine-1.5 phosphate (6.17 g: 22.6 mmol, yield=91%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 158째 C., 226째 C., 278째 C.
Elemental analysis: C7H14N2.1.5H3PO4
Theoretical value: P, 17.01% Actual measured value: P, 16.5%
