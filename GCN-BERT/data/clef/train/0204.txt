Step C: 7-(3-Fluoroazetidin-1-yl)-8-(7-methyl-1H-indazol-5-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
To a solution of 7-(3-fluoroazetidin-1-yl)-8-(7-methyl-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (65 mg, 0.125 mmol) in DCM (2 mL) was added TFA (1 mL, 13.2 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, then the solvent removed in vacuo, and the residue purified by reverse-phase preparative HPLC (XBridge 18C OBD column, 5-99% ACN in 20 mM NH4OH), to obtain the title compound as a white solid (8 mg, 16% yield).
