Example 57
tert-Butyl ((4-methyl-5-((4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)carbamoyl)thiazol-2-yl)methyl)carbamate (0.100 g, 0.200 mmol) was suspended 6 mL of 4M hydrogen chloride solution in dioxane in sealed flask. The mixture was stirred for 6 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The HCl salt was dissolved in minimum amount of methanol and quenched with sat. sodium bicarbonate. The mixture was extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (6Ã—10 mL). The combined organic layers were washed once with sat. NaHCO3, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. to give 2-(aminomethyl)-4-methyl-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.060 g, 75%) as an orange solid.
