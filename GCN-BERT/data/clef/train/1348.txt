Step 6: Synthesis of 1-(4-amino-2-chlorophenyl) ethanone (8)
1-(2-Chloro-4-nitrophenyl) ethanone (87.8 g, 0.43 mol, 1 equiv.) was charged in methanol (600 mL). The reaction mixture was heated to 70° C. and concentrated HCl (131 mL, 1.29 mol, 3 equiv.) was added dropwise with constant stirring. After the completion of addition, iron powder (98.2 g, 1.75 mol, 4 equiv.) was added in four parts at 5 minute intervals. The reaction mixture was heated at 70° C. for 7 h and the reaction monitored by TLC and NMR. After completion of reaction, the mixture was allowed to come to RT and then filtered through a celite bed. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and celite bed was washed with EtOAc to obtain further crude product. Both portions were combined and water (200 mL) was added. The EtOAc layer was separated and aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2×500 mL). The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to get crude product (57 g). This crude product was precipitated in pentane to get 1-(4-amino-3-methoxyphenyl) ethanone (8) (50 g (67% yield)) as a pink solid.
