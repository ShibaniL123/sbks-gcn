Compound 134B (1.1 g, 4.22 mmol) was added to a solution of ethanol (15 mL) at 12 °C and then cyclopropylamine (481 mg, 8.44 mmol) was added thereto and stirred at 80 °C for 16 hours, and then cooled to 15 °C. The solution was concentrated and purified by column chromatography to give compound 134C (pale yellow solid, 845 mg, the yield was 74%).
