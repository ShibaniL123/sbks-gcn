Step 5: 1-(2-(4-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)(methyl)amino)-2-methoxy-5 -nitrophenylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-one
1-(2-(4-Fluoro-2-methoxy-5-nitrophenylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-methyl-1H-benzo[d ]imidazol-2(3H)-one p-toluenesulfonate (440 mg, 0.76 mmol) was dissolved in NMP (5 mL). Diisopropylethylamine (206 mg, 1.59 mmol) and N1,N1,N2-trimethylethane-1,2-diamine (116 mg, 1.14 mmol) were added thereto, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at 85Â°C. The reaction solution was cooled and then poured into water (50 mL). Then the mixture was suction-filtered, and the filter cake was rinsed with a small amount of methanol, and dried to give the title compound (326 mg, 88%).
