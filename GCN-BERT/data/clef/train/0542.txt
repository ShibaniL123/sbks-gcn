Step 4: Preparation of N-phenyl-N-(3-(4-(piperidine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide
A final product, N-phenyl-N-(3-(4-(piperidine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide, was obtained (50 mg, 15% yield) by the same method as described in Step 5 of Example 1 using the N-phenylpentaneamide (146 mg, 0.82 mmol) obtained in Step 1 of Example 1 and the 3-(4-(pyridine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl methanesulfonate (396 mg, 1.23 mmol) obtained in Step 3.
