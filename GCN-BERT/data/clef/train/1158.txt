Step 2 Synthesis of compound 37c
The obtained compound 37b (2.00 g, 6.19 mmol) and N-hydroxyphthalimide (1.21 g, 7.43 mmol) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (20 ml). Diisopropylethylamine (1.30 ml, 7.43 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Then, water was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by water and brine in this order and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate was filtered off. Then, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. Diisopropyl ether was added to the residue to precipitate a solid. The precipitates were collected by filtration to afford the compound 37c (2.28 g, 91%).
