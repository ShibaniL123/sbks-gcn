Step 3. Ethyl 2-(3,5-dichloropyrazin-2-yl)-2-oxoacetate
To a solution of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (67 mL, 0.4 moles) in THF (600 mL) at −78° C. was added n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 208 mL, 0.52 mol). The mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 20 min. and then warmed to 0° C. In a separate flask, diethyl oxalate (65 mL, 0.48 mol) and 2,6-dichloropyrazine (60 g, 0.4 mol) were dissolved in THF (600 mL) and cooled to −78° C. The lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine solution was added to the 2,6-dichloropyrazine solution via cannula over 1 h at −78° C. The mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 20 min and then the mixture was poured into a mixture of saturated ammonium chloride (300 mL) and water (300 mL). The mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (300 mL) and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (300 mL) and the combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (5 to 20% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to provide the title compound (32 g, 32% yield).
