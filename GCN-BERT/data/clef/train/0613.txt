(Example 13) Synthesis of 3-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-1-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-3-oxopropylpentanoate:
Pyridine (0.069 mL, 0.86 mmol) and pentanoyl chloride (0.093 mL, 0.79 mmol) were added to a solution of 1-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one (0.200 g, 0.713 mmol) in dichloromethane (3.5 mL) at room temperature and the reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 16 hours. A saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride was added to the reaction liquid and the reaction liquid was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (NH silica gel, chloroform/methanol) to obtain 3-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-1-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-3 -oxopropylpentanoate (0.101 g, 0.277 mmol, 39%) (hereinafter referred to as the compound of Example 13) as a colorless oil.
