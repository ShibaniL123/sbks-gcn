Example 38
Synthesis of 5-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)-1,3-dimethylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (35 mg, 98 µmol), 1,3-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid (35 mg, 0.19 mmol), triethylamine (70 µL, 0.50 mmol), and HATU (145 mg, 0.38 mmol) were reacted, then to the reaction solution, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, and then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was suspended in 6% aqueous ammonia (20 mL), and the suspension was extracted with ethyl acetate (15 mL x 2). The combined organic layers were washed with saturated brine (10 mL), and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to column chromatography (aminosilica gel, 10 g) using methanol and ethyl acetate (concentration gradient, 0 to 30%) as the elution solvent, and thereby purified. The obtained syrup-like substance was dissolved in methanol (0.2 mL), then powdered by adding t-butyl methyl ether (3 mL) to the solution, and collected by filtration to obtain the title compound (39 mg, 76%) as white powder.
