Step 1. Methyl 3,5-difluoro-4-(3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridin-5-yl)benzoate
5-Chloro-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (348 mg, 0.956 mmol, Intermediate 2), methyl 3,5-difluoro-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzoate (342 mg, 1.148 mmol), chloro(2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)[2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) (Pd XPhos G2) (75 mg, 0.096 mmol) and potassium phosphate (406 mg, 1.91 mmol) were placed in a flask and the flask was evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Then dioxane (20 mL) and degassed water (2 mL) were added, and reaction mixture was stirred at 90° C. for 2 h. After cooling to r.t., the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, and the resulting mixture was washed with brine. The separated organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (440 mg, 92%).
