Step 7 Synthesis of compound 1-052
A solution of the compound 52i (436 mg, 0.43 mmol) in dichloromethane (4.4 mL) was cooled to -40°C. Then, anisole (0.470 mL, 4.3 mmol) and a 2 mol/L solution of aluminum chloride in nitromethane (2.15 mL, 4.3 mmol) were added in this order to the solution. The mixture was stirred at -30°C for 30 minutes. Diisopropyl ether, ice water, and acetonitrile were added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred to completely dissolve insoluble matter. Then, the aqueous layer was separated. The organic layer was subjected to extraction with water again. Then, all the aqueous layers were combined. HP20-SS resin was added to the mixture. Acetonitrile was evaporated under reduced pressure. 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid (1.0 mL) was added to the residue. The obtained mixed solution was purified by OSD column chromatography (water-acetonitrile). Fractions containing the desired compound were collected. A 0.2 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was added to the fractions until the pH became 6. Then, a small amount of dry ice was added to the mixture. The obtained solution was concentrated under reduced pressure and then freeze-dried to afford the compound I-052 (182 mg, yield 78%) as a white powder.
