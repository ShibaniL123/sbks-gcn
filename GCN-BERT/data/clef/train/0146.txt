Intermediate 35: 5-Chloro-6-(difluoromethyl)-2-ethyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Step A: 5-Chloro-2-ethyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-6-carbaldehyde. To a solution of 5-chloro-2-ethyl-6-iodo-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (Intermediate 25, 409 mg, 1.33 mmol) in THF (4.4 mL) at 0° C. was added isopropylmagnesium chloride (2.0 M in THF; 0.8 mL, 1.60 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1 h, then N-formylpiperidine (0.18 mL, 1.60 mmol) was added. The reaction was allowed to warm to rt and stirred for 2 h. The mixture was then transferred to a stirring solution of AcOH (1 mL) and diluted with EtOAc. Sat. aq. NH4Cl and H2O were added, and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (194 mg, 70%).
