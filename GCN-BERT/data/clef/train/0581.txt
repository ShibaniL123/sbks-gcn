Synthesis of compound 11-c
At -78°C, a solution of 2.5M n-butyl lithium in n-hexane (1.7mL, 4.2mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of compound 11-d (910mg, 3.8mmol) in anhydrous THF (20mL), the mixture was stirred for 1h, followed by adding trimethyl borate (594mg, 5.7mmol) to the reaction solution. The reaction solution was slowly warmed to room temperature, further stirred for 16hrs, saturated NaCl aq. solution (20mL) was added. Organic phase was seperated, the aqueous phase was extracted with EA (60mL×3). The combined organic phases were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure to give yellow solid 11-c (700mg, yield 90%). The product was directly used for the next step without further purification.
