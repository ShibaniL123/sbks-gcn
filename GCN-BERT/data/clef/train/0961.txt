A solution of tert-butyl (2-((1-(but-3-yn-1-ylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl)amino)-8-cyclopentyl-7-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)carbamate (137B, 166 mg, 0.29 mmol) and methanesulfonic acid (195 μL, 2.9 mmol) in DCM (10 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The solution was concentrated to dryness, and the residue treated with ice (10 g) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (10 mL), causing some gas evolution. The resulting suspension was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, then the solids collected by filtration. The precipitate was washed with water and dried in a vacuum oven (45° C., 10 mmHg) to give 6-amino-2-{[1-(but-3-yn-1-ylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino}-8-cyclopentylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (Example 137, 119 mg, 91%) as a light yellow solid.
