Preparation 3: Synthesis of Intermediate 3 {4-(4-(4-iodophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)butanamide}
Step 2: Synthesis of 4-(4-(4-iodophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)butanamide
To a solution of 4-(4-(4-iodophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoic acid (1.76 g, 1 eq) in DMF (10 ml) was added with HATU (1-[Bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate) (2.02 g, 1.4 eq), HOBT (Hydroxybenzotriazole) (0.81 g, 1.4 eq), Et3N (1.6 ml, 3 eq), O-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (1.17 g, 2 eq) and stirred for 1 hr at room temperature. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (0.6 g, 28%).
