Step 3: 5-methylpyridine-2-carbaldehyde
To a solution of (5-methylpyridin-2-yl)methanol [Example 2, Step 2] (2 g, 16.24 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in chloroform (25 mL) was added MnO2 (18.39 g, 211.53 mmol, 13.00 equiv). The mixture was stirred overnight at 50Â° C. The solids were filtered out. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to afford 500 mg (25%) of 5-methylpyridine-2-carbaldehyde as brown oil.
