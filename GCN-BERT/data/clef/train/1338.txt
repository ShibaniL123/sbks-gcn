Example 1: (2R,3S,5R)-5-(2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo[3',4':3,4]pyrazolo[1,5-b][1,2]thiazine -1,1-dioxide-6-yl)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-amine
Step1: tert-butyl (2R,3S,5R)-5-(2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo[3',4':3,4]pyrazolo[1,5-b][1,2] thiazine-1,1-dioxide-6-yl)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate
To N,N-dimethylacetamide (2 mL) were added tert-butyl (2R,3S)-2-(2,5-di-fluorophenyl) -5-oxotetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate (48 mg, 0.146 mmol), 2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo [3',4':3,4]pyrazolo[1,5-b][1,2]thiazine-1,1-dioxide p-toluenesulfonate (48 mg, 0.13 mmol) and triethylamine (10 mg, 0.1 mmol), and stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. After cooling in an ice bath, sodium triacetoxyborohydride (87 mg, 0.39 mmol) was added, slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. Saturated sodium bicarbonate solution was added, and the resulting mixture was extracted with dichloromethane, washed with saturated brine, dried, concentrated and then purified by silica gel column chromatography to give tert-butyl (2R,3S,5R)-5-(2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo[3',4':3,4]pyrazolo[1,5-b][1,2]thiazine-1,1-dioxide-6-yl) -2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate (48 mg). Yield: 71%.
