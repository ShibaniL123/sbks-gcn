(103-2) Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-{5-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl}pyrrolidin-2-one (Compound 103)
To a solution of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-oxo-N'-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)benzoyl]pyrrolidin-3-carbohydrazide (100 mg) in anhydrous THF (5 mL) was added the Burgess reagent (70 mg) with stirring at room temperature. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 4 hours. After the reaction completed, water was added to the reaction solution to stop the reaction. The reaction solution was diluted with ethyl acetate (30 mL) and washed with saturated brine (30 mL Ã— 2). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to obtain the title compound (60 g, yield 63%).
