Alternative Preparation of tert-butyl (1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)carbamate
Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (2.31 mL, 13.75 mmol), followed by 2,6-dimethylpyridine (1.74 mL, 15.00 mmol) were added to a solution of 3-fluoropropan-1-ol (0.94 mL, 12.5 mmol) in DCM (47 mL) at 0° C. and the reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was washed with 1N HCl, then the organic layer was dried and carefully evaporated. The residue was then added to a separate flask containing a suspension of tert-butyl azetidin-3-ylcarbamate (1.94 g, 11.25 mmol) and DIPEA (3.24 ml, 18.75 mmol) in dioxane/DCM (1:1, 40 mL) and the reaction was stirred at room temperature (exothermic on addition of triflate). The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM and washed with NH4Cl solution. The organic layer was dried and evaporated under reduced pressure to give the crude product. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 10% 1M NH3/MeOH in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford tert-butyl (1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)carbamate (2.82 g, 97%) as a mauve oil
