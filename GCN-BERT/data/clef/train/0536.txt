Synthesis of 4-chloro-N-(1-(5-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)vinyl)benzamide (Compound 115)
(115-1) Synthesis of 4-chloro-N-(1-(5-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)vinyl)benzamide (Compound 115)
Triethylamine (0.59 mL) and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (348 mg) were added to a solution of (S)-4-chloro-N-(2-hydroxy-1-{5-[4-trifluoromethoxy]phenyl}-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)ethyl)benzamide (600 mg) and DMAP (51 mg) in dichloromethane (50 mL) with stirring under ice cooling. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 18 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction solution was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride (30 mL Ã— 2) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to give the title compound (200 mg, yield 35%).
