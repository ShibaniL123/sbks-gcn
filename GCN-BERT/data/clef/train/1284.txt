(Reference Example 1) Synthesis of 4-Chlorofuroxan Compound and 3-Chlorofuroxan Compound
Tetrabutylammonium chloride (111.2 mg, 0.4 mmol) and 3-(4-methylphenyl)-4-nitrofuroxan (44.2 mg, 0.2 mmol) were weighed into a flask, and dimethylformamide (0.5 mL) was added. The reaction solution was sealed and stirred at 80Â° C. for 14 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, and water (2 mL) and diethyl ether (2 mL) were added. The mixture was subjected to liquid separation and the aqueous layer was further extracted with diethyl ether three times. The combined organic layers were dried by adding anhydrous sodium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain 20.2 mg (48% yield) of 4-chloro-3-(4-methylphenyl)furoxan. At the same time, 1.7 mg (4% yield) of 3-chloro-4-(4-methylphenyl)furoxan was obtained.
