Step 4 Synthesis of compound 64g
The compound 64f (563 mg, 0.808 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (2.8 mL) and DMA (2.8 mL). The solution was cooled to -20°C. Then, 37% peracetic acid (0.218 mL, 1.21 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1.5 hours. Then, 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen sulfite was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by water and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate was filtered off. Then, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate-methanol) to afford the compound 64g (320 mg, 56%).
