Step 4. 7-Bromo-2-cyclopropylimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine
A suspension of 7-bromo-4-chloro-2-cyclopropylimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine (0.512 g, 1.87 mmol, prepared as in Step 3) in ammonium hydroxide (14.8 M, 13 mL, 190 mmol) was heated to 80° C. for 30 minutes, then at room temperature overnight. Brine was added and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3×). The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The product was purified by flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient from 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes to obtain desired product as white solid (140 mg, 29%). LCMS for C8H9BrN5 (M+H)+: calculated m/z=254.0, found 254.0.
