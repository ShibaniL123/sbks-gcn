Step 1: Preparation of 2-chloro-6-methylbenzoyl chloride
10.073 g (59.04 mmol) of 2-chloro-6-methylbenzoic acid was mixed with anhydrous dichloromethane (150 mL), to which 10.3 ml (118.09 mmol, 2 equivalents) of oxalylchloride was added. Dimethylformamide was dropped thereto 1-2 drops, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. As a result, 11.479 g of the target compound brown liquid target compound 2-chloro-6-methylbenzoyl chloride was obtained as a brown liquid (59.04 mmol, yield: 100%).
