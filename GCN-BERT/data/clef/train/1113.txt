Synthesis of N-(2-chloro-4-deuterio-6-methyl-phenyl)-2-[[2-methyl-6-(1-piperidyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]amino]thiazole-5-carboxamide(Compound I)
Preparation of N,N-diallyl-4-bromo-2-chloro-6-methylaniline (2): To a 250 mL flask were added 4-bromo-2-chloro-6-methylaniline (3 g, 13.61 mmol), dimethyl formamide (DMF) (50 mL), and sodium carbonate (6.37 g, 60.09 mmol, 4.4 eq) at 0° C. With stirring, allyl bromide (9.4 mL, 108.62 mmol, 8 eq) was added dropwise at 0-5° C. under nitrogen. After addition, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 min and heated at 120° C. under nitrogen for 3 h when TLC analysis showed no presence of the starting material. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and poured into cold water followed by extraction with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (2×150 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (3×100 mL), dried (sodium sulfate, Na2SO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure to get a black-brown liquid residue, which was purified by column chromatography (hexanes only) to give compound 2 (3.9 g, 95%) as a pale brown liquid.
