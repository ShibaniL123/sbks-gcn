N-(1-acetyl-3-ipiperidyl)-4-(6-fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)benzamide
To a cold (4 °C) solution of 4-(6-Fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)-N-(3-piperidyl)benzamide (Example 118, 25 mg, 0.07 mmol) and DIPEA (26.2 µL, 0.15 mmol) in DCM (1 mL) and DMA (0.3 mL) was added drop-wise a solution of acetyl chloride (5.4 µl, 0.07mmol) in DCM (0.5 mL). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm-up to room temperature and stirred for 2 h. The reaction was quenched by addition of aq. sat. NH4Cl-solution and ethyl acetate was added. The organic layer was separated, washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was triturated with acetonitrile. The white solids were filtered, washed with diethyl ether and dried to give 13 mg of the title compound (yield: 49%). Data: LCMS (B) Rt: 10.240 min; m/z 380.2 (M+H)+.
