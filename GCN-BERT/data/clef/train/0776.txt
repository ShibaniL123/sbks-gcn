Step 4. benzyl 1-((3-(4-aminoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-4-methylphenyl)sulfonamido)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane-3-carboxylate
To a solution of benzyl 1-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane-3-carboxylate hydrochloride (34 mg, 0.12 mmol), Et3N (0.069 mL, 0.49 mmol), and DMAP (1.5 mg, 0.012 mmol) in DCM (0.5 mL) was added 3-(4-aminoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (40. mg, 0.12 mmol) and the resulting mixture was stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The crude reaction mixture was purified by CombiFlash chromatography (12 g silica gel column, eluting with 0-15% methanol/dichloromethane) to afford the desired product (18 mg, 27%). LCMS for C26H27N7O4S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=534.6; found 534.1.
