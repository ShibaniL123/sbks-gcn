PETS (11.4 g, 15 mmol) was reacted with 3-fluorophenol (5.9 g, 53 mmol, 3.5 eq) in the presence of anhydrous K2CO3 (10.4 g, 100 mmol, 5 eq.) in dry DMF (25 mL) at 110Â° C. for 21 h under nitrogen. The reaction was monitored by TLC. After tri-substituted product became the major one in the reaction mixture, it was poured into 200 mL of ice-cold water and neutralized with 1M HCl. Extraction with DCM, washing of the organic layer with water, drying over anhydrous MgSO4, and evaporation of the solvent afforded 11.2 g of the crude product as a yellowish oil. Purification by column chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate (4:1) as a mobile phase gave Compound F2, 3-(3-fluorophenoxy)-2,2-bis((3-fluorophenoxy)methyl)propyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate, as the second fraction (5.0 g, 58% yield).
