Example 3
Synthesis of 3-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth [1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (39 mg, 0.11 mmol), 2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid (39 mg, 0.28 mmol), triethylamine (70 ÂµL, 0.50 mmol), and HATU (130 mg, 0.34 mmol) were reacted. To the reaction solution, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was directly subjected to column chromatography (silica gel, 10 g) using methanol and ethyl acetate containing 5% triethylamine (concentration gradient, 10 to 50%) as the elution solvent, and thereby purified. The obtained residue was powdered from 6% aqueous ammonia to obtain the title compound (13 mg, 25%) as pale yellow powder.
