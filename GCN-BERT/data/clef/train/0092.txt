1-Methoxymethyl-2-(4-iso-butylphenyl)-4,5-dibromoimidazole (6). Compound 5 (3.66 g, 10.2 mmol) and 4-iso-butylphenylboronic acid (1.89 g, 10.6 mmol) were dissolved in toluene/MeOH (5:1, 105.0 mL), and an aqueous solution of K2CO3 (2.0 M, 11.5 mL) was added. The mixture was degassed with argon for 20 minutes while stirring, followed by the addition of Pd(PPh3)4 (1.23 g, 1.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred at reflux for 18 h. It was cooled to room temperature and diluted with water (40 mL) and EtOAc (20 mL). The layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (3Ã—20 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with brine (20 mL) and dried (Na2SO4). The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the crude product was purified by flash chromatography (silica, 100% hexanes to 9:1 hexanes/EtOAc) to give a pale-yellow viscous oil (3.83 g, 86%).
