6-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-1-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4-methyl-pyrazolo [4,3 - d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione
Step 1
6-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-1-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4-methyl-pyrazolo [4,3 - d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione
3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl methanesulfonate (80.6 mg, 0.318 mmol), 1-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4-methyl-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione (50.0 mg, 0.227 mmol), potassium iodide (3.8 mg, 0.0227 mmol) and potassium carbonate (88.0 mg, 0.636 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL). The reaction solution was warmed to 120Â°C and stirred for 3 hours. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC to give 6-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-1-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4-methyl-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione (20.0 mg) with a yield of 25%.
