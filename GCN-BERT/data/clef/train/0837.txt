2-((S)-2-((S)-1-((S)-2-Ammonio-3-(1H-imidazol-1-ium-4-yl)propanoyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxamido)-2-phenylethyl)pyridinium trichloride
tert-Butyl (S)-3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)-1-oxo-1-((S)-2-((S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylcarbamoyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)propan-2-ylcarbamate (100 mg, 0.19 mmol) was dissolved in a 4 M HCl solution in 1,4-dioxane (2.3 mL, 9.39 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 18 h. The volatiles were removed under vacuum and the product was triturated in MTBE. The solid was recovered by filtration on a BÃ¼chner funnel, washed with MTBE and dried under vacuum. The solid was dissolved in water and freeze dried to afford 85 mg (69%) of the title compound
