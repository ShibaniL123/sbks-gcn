Synthesis of 1-(5-difluoromethoxy-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one (Compound Example 114)
1-(3-Fluoro-5-hydroxy-2-pyridyl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methylpyrazol-4-yl)imidazo-[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one (80 mg, 0.18 mmol, 95%), potassium carbonate (52.5 mg, 0.36 mmol, 95%), N,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml) were initially introduced in a sealed 8 ml reaction vessel, the vessel was flushed with chlorodifluoromethane and a chlorodifluoromethane atmosphere was maintained at −30° C. The solution was stirred at 40° C. for 2 days. The reaction was then terminated by addition of 20 ml of ice-water. The solution was extracted three times with 50 ml of ethyl acetate each time, and the organic phases were combined. The mixture was washed once with 20 ml of salt solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by means of preparative HPLC, giving 27.7 mg (32%) of 1-(5-difluoromethoxy-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one as white solid.
