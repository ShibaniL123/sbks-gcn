The fourth step
To a solution of Compound 8 (418mg, 1.02mmol) in dichloromethane (4.18mL) were added pyridine (0.0980mL, 1.23mmol) and chloroacetyl chloride (0.124mL, 1.53mmol) under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 48 minutes. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of ice water and 2 mol / L aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and saturated brine successively, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 9 (463mg, yield 93.3%).
