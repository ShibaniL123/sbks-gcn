Step B: 8-(7-Chloro-1H-indazol-5-yl)-2-(difluoromethyl)-7-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine
To a solution of 5-(7-chloro-1H-indazol-5-yl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-amine (150 mg, 0.62 mmol) in 1,4 dioxane (0.45 mL) were added 3A° molecular sieves (20 mg), followed by the addition of 3-bromo-1,1-difluoropropan-2-one (Intermediate 18, 128 mg, 0.74 mmol). The mixture was heated to 60° C. for 12 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with EtOAc, and filtered through a pad of Celite®. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the residue purified by preparative TLC (SiO2; 60% EtOAc/hexanes) to provide the title compound (7.2 mg, 29% yield).
