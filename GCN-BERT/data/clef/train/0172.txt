Step 3: 2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(5-fluoro-1 H-indol-1-yl)acetate
The acid from step 2 (39.7 mg, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in dry DCM (5 mL) under argon, and added DCC (42.3 mg, 0.2 mmol) and DMAP (5.1 mg, 0.04 mmol) at 0 Â°C, followed by N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (52.8 mg, 0.2 mmol), synthesized as reported in Example 1, step. The mixture was left stirring overnight. The suspension was filtered over cotton to remove the bulk of DCU and purified by column chromatography (75% EtOAc in hexane) to yield 75 mg of the title compound (87%).
