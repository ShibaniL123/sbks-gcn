190.5: 5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one
640 mg (1.9 mmol) of 5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one is dissolved in 5 mL of trifluoroacetic acid. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min and then concentrated to dryness under vacuum, diluted with dichloromethane, and finally hydrolysed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate. The product is extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phases are combined, washed once with water and then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product obtained is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a dichloromethane/ethyl acetate mixture 80/20. 85 mg (20%) of 5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one is obtained.
