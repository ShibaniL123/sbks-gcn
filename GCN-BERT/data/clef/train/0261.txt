(Example 1) Synthesis of 4-Fluorofuroxan Compound
3-(4-Methylphenyl)-4-nitrofuroxan (500 mg) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (4.6 mL) and the resulting solution was cooled to 0° C. A solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran (1 M, 2.9 mL) was slowly added dropwise to the resulting solution. After stirring the mixture at 0° C. for 1 hour, a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution was added thereto and the mixture was extracted with methylene chloride. After drying the extract over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solid was removed by filtration and then the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain 404 mg (yield: 92%) of 4-fluoro-3-(4-methylphenyl)furoxan.
