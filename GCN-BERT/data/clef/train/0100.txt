2-(difluoromethoxy)nicotinaldehyde
(2-(Difluoromethoxy)pyridin-3-yl)methanol (4.07 g, 23.24 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (93 mL). After cooling to 5° C. in an ice-water bath, Dess-Martin periodinane (11.83 g, 27.9 mmol) was added in portions, maintaining an internal temperature 20° C. After the addition was complete, the flask was warmed to room temperature for 15 minutes, at which point the reaction was complete. The mixture was diluted with 250 mL of methyl tert-butyl ether and stirred with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (80 mL) and saturated sodium thiosulfate (80 mL) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether (2×150 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with brine then concentrated and purified via flash column (0 to 20% ethyl acetate in heptanes) to provide the title compound 2-(difluoromethoxy)nicotinaldehyde (2.38 g, 13.75 mmol, 59.2% yield).
