Compound 27-2 (289 mg, 0.07 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane, and DMAP (cat.) was added. Triethylamine (1.8 ml, 5.49 mmol) was added dropwise and acetic anhydride (1.8 ml, 5.49 mmol) was further added dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with water, and the resultant was extracted with dichloromethane, concentrated and isolated by column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol (v/v) = 50/1) to give product 27-3 (127 mg, yield 42%):
