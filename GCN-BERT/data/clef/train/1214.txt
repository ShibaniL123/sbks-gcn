[Step 4] Synthesis of N-(2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)acetamide
Methyl 3-fluoro-4-((N-(3-fluorophenyl)acetamido)methyl)benzoate (0.210 g, 0.658 mmol), synthesized in step 3, and hydrazine hydrate (0.658 g, 13.153 mmol) were mixed in ethanol (10 mL) at room temperature, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 18 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. Then, water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound was used without further purification (0.187 g, 89.0%) as white foam solid.
