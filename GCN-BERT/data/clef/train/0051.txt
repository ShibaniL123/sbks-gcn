Example 4
Preparation of tert-butyl (4-((3-(2-chloro-5-((1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamido)-2,6-difluorophenyl)amino)-4-oxobutyl)carbamate (F1199)
To a solution of N-(3-amino-2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-chloro-5-((1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide (DP2) (0.100 g, 0.173 mmol) in ethyl acetate (2 mL) stirred at room temperature were added 4-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)butanoic acid (0.035 g, 0.173 mmol) and pyridine (0.028 mL, 0.345 mmol). 2,4,6-Tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (T3P®; 165 mg, 0.259 mmol was added a 50% solution in ethyl acetate. The reaction mixture was warmed to 50° C. for 18 hours then cooled to room temperature and concentrated under a stream of nitrogen. Purification by column chromatography using 0-80% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent afforded the title compound as a white solid (0.111 g, 84%).
