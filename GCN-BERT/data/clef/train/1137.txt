A solution of 8-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-(methylsulfanyl)-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (2A, 99% ee, 2.33 g, 8 mmol), 2-MeTHF (40 mL), water (8 mL) and OXONE® (12.3 g, 20 mmol) was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The solution was cooled in a water bath, diluted with water (10 mL) and sat. aq NaCl (10 mL), and extracted with EtOAc (80 mL×3). The combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate, evaporated to a dark oil (3.76 g), and purified by silica gel chromatography (eluting with a gradient of 20-100% EtOAc in heptane) to give 8-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-(methylsulfonyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (2B, 2.2 g, 84%) as a foamy solid.
