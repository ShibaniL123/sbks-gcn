Step 2: Synthesis of 4-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate
To a solution of tert-butyl 4-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-3,6-dihydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxylate (1.1 g, 1 eq) in dichloromethane (10 ml) was added with trifluoroacetic acid (2 ml, 8 eq). The mixture was stirred for 1 hr at room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was diluted with dichloromethane and poured into excess diethyl ether. The precipitated solid was filtered off to prepare the title compound (1.08 g, 94%).
