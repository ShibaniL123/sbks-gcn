(6-cyclobutyl-3-methoxy-pyridazin-4-yl)-methanol
Diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H 1.0 M solution in tetrahydrofuran, CAS#1191-15-7, 1.25 mL, 1.25 mmol, 2.0 eq) was added to a previously cooled (−78° C.) solution of 6-cyclobutyl-3-methoxy-pyridazine-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (137 mg, 0.62 mmol, 1.0 eq) in toluene (5 mL). The reaction mixture was warmed to 0° C. and was stirred for 15 minutes. Total completion was obtained. The reaction mixture was poured into a mixture of ethyl acetate and a saturated aqueous solution of potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate (Rochelle salt). The mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 minutes until a clear solution was obtained. The organic phase was separated, washed with brine, dried on MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (heptane/ethyl acetate 80/20 to 50/50) to give the title compound (65 mg, 54%). LC/MS (ESI+) m/z 195.3 (M+H)+.
