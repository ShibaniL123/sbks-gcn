Example 100A
Ethyl 4-{[(6-bromo-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}-2,2-difluorobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
At RT, 0.004 ml (0.075 mmol) of ethanol and 0.49 ml (3.74 mmol) of DAST were added to a solution of 200 mg (0.37 mmol) of the compound from Example 99A in 4.9 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane, and the mixture was stirred at 60° C. for 20 h. A further 0.49 ml (3.74 mmol) of DAST were then added, and the mixture was stirred at 60° C. for a further 5 days. A further 0.49 ml (3.74 mmol) of DAST were added, and the mixture was stirred at 60° C. for a further day. After cooling to RT, the mixture was diluted with 80 ml of water and 80 ml of dichloromethane and adjusted to pH 7 with about 20 ml of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. After phase separation, the aqueous phase was extracted once with 80 ml of dichloromethane, and the combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was taken up in dichloromethane and purified by column chromatography (100 g of silica gel, Biotage, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 7:3). This gave 89 mg (43% of theory; purity 100% by LC/MS) of the title compound
