Step 2. tert-Butyl 3-(difluoromethyl)-5-fluoro-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzyl(methyl)carbamate
To a solution of tert-butyl (3-(difluoromethyl)-5-fluorobenzyl)(methyl)carbamate (256.5 mg, 0.887 mmol) in THF (8.0 ml) at −78° C. was added LDA (2.0 M in THF) (600.0 μl, 1.200 mmol) dropwise. The mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 30 min. A solution of 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (336.0 mg, 1.806 mmol) in THF (5.0 ml) was added dropwise. The reaction was stirred at −78° C. for 15 min and then allowed to warm to room temperature. After stirring at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction was treated with sat. NaHCO3 (aq) and extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined organic phases were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (20 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product (62.6 mg, 17%).
