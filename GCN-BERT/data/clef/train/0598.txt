Step 1: 3-Bromo-5-fluoroisonicotinaldehyde
To a LDA solution (1M in hexanes/THF, 12.55 mL, 12.55 mmol) was added a solution of 3-bromo-5-fluoropyridine (1.84 g, 10.46 mmol) in THF (20 ml) at −78° C. dropwise. The mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 1 h. Then DMF (1.62 mL, 1.53 g, 20.91 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. After stirring at −78° C. for 30 min, the reaction mixture was quenched with aq. sat. NaHCO3 solution followed by extracting with EtOAC three times and DCM twice. All the organic layers were combined and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solid was filtered out. Volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified with silica-gel chromatography (DCM) to afford the title compound (0.478 g, 22%).
