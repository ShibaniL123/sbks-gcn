Step 1. 4-Hydroxybicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-1-carboxylic acid
To a solution of methyl 4-hydroxybicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-1-carboxylate (487 mg, 2.86 mmol, Advanced Chemblocks, L13452) in MeOH (5 mL) was added sodium hydroxide (572 mg, 14.3 mmol) in water (5.0 mL) and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature. After 1 h, the reaction mixture was acidified with 1 M HCl to pH 1 and extracted with three portions of EtOAc. The organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to afford a tan solid (257 mg, 58%) that was used without purification.
