A mixture of isobutyl 4'-hydroxy-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carboxylate (16.00 g, 59 mmol), pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (9.70 g, 25 mmol), potassium carbonate (13.80 g, 100 mmol), and DMF (50 mL) was stirred under argon and heated at 110Â° C. for 24 h. After cooling, the mixture was poured into ice/water (300 mL), neutralized with 3N HCl, and extracted with toluene/ethyl acetate (1:1, 500 mL). The extract was washed with water (200 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, and the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was chromatographed (silica gel, hexane/toluene/ethyl acetate, 44:50:6) to give Compound B24 (10.00 g, 42% yield).
