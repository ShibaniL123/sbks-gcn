Synthesis Example 1: Synthesis of [Compound 1]
Synthesis Example 1-1: Synthesis of [Intermediate 1-a]
Dibenzofuran-1-boronic acid (25 g, 118 mmol), methyl-5-bromo-2-iodobenzoate (40.5 g, 118 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (2.7 g, 2.3 mmol), potassium carbonate (33 g, 237 mmol), toluene (200 ml), 1,4-dioxane (200 ml), and water (100 ml) were placed under a nitrogen atmosphere in a round-bottom flask and fluxed for 12 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was layer separated, and the organic layer was concentrated at a reduced pressure. Column chromatographic separation yielded Intermediate 1-a (33.5 g): yield 74%
