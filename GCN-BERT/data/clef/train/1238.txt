Example 6A
rac-Benzyl [2-cyano(4,4,4-2H3)butan-2-yl]carbamate
2.75 g (13.59 mmol at a purity of about 50%) of rac-2-amino-2-methyl(4,4,4-2H3)butanonitrile from Example 5A were initially charged in 33 ml of tetrahydrofuran/water=9/1, and 5.82 g (42.13 mmol) of potassium carbonate were added. At 0Â° C., 2.32 g (13.59 mmol) of benzyl chloroformate were slowly added dropwise. Then the mixture was allowed to warm up gradually to room temperature with stirring, and was stirred at room temperature overnight. The supernatant solvent was decanted off, the residue was twice stirred with 25 ml each time of tetrahydrofuran, and then the supernatant solvent was decanted off each time. The combined organic phases were concentrated and the crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography (mobile phase gradient: cyclohexane to cyclohexane/dichloromethane gradient 1/1 to 1/2). This gave 2.56 g of the title compound (78% of theory).
