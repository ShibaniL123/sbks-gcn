Step 5: Preparation of 4-(3-(4-(3H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-6-yl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluorobenzyl)phthalazin-1(2H)-one
Analogous to the process for preparing Compound (1) in Step 7 in Example 1, Compound r was condensed with Compound f to produce Compound (6): 4-(3-(4-(3H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-6-yl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluorobenzyl)phthalazin-1(2H)-one (16 mg, yield 20%).
