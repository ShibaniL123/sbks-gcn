Complete Synthesis of Compound No. 37
Step 1: Synthesis of 2-isobutylpyridine-4-carbonitrile (2)
To a suspension of 4-cyano pyridine (1) (30 g, 0.288 mol, 1 equiv.) in water (210 mL), concentrated sulfuric acid (15.3 mL, 0.288 mol, 1 equiv.) was added dropwise maintaining the temperature at 20-25° C. After formation of a clear solution, AgNO3 (4.9 g, 0.028 mmol, 0.0001 equiv.) followed by isovaleric acid (160 mL, 1.47 mol, 5 equiv.) were added in to the reaction mixture. A white hazy solution formed. Ammonium peroxydisulfate (66 g, 0.288 mol, 1 equiv.) dissolved in water (90 mL) was then added. A black clear solution formed. The reaction mixture was then heated to reflux at 100° C. for 3 h. The reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion, the reaction mixture was basified (pH=7-8) using a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, and extracted with EtOAc (3×750 mL). The extracts were combined and were washed with brine (3×300 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution was concentrated under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel: #100-200) using 0-6% EtOAc in hexane as eluant to afford 2-isobutylpyridine-4-carbonitrile (2) (15 g (32.5% yield)) as a pale yellow liquid.
