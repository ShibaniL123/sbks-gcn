(3) The preparation of 1-[(4,5-difluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-amino-piperidine-1-yl]-xanthine
Dissolving the compound 1-[(4,5-difluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-t-butyloxycarbon ylamino-piperidine-1-yl]-xanthine (0.4 g, 0.7 mmol) in dichrolomethane (8 ml), dropping trifluoroacetic acid (2 ml) in at room temperature to react for 1 hour at room temperature. After adding dichloromethane (10ml) to dilute the reaction solution, washing with potassium carbonate aqueous solution with pH of 10, extracting with dichloromethane, drying with organic phase with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtering and concentrating. Separating and purifying residue thin layer chromatography (methylene chloride: methanol=20:1) to obtain compound 1-[(4,5-difluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-amino-piperidine-1-yl]-xanthine (0.26 g, yellow solid),with a yield of 79%. ES-API(m/z):[M+H]+468.2.
