Step 2
3,6-Dibromo-9-isobutyl-9H-carbazole (7.6 g, 20 mmol) was reacted with 4-isobutoxy-phenylboronic acid (3.88 g, 20 mmol) in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) in a mixture of toluene, ethanol and 2M Na2CO3 (60-40-20 mL) at 110Â° C. for 16 h. After cooling, the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (300 mL), washed with water (200 mL), dried (Na2SO4), and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Column chromatography of the residue with DCM/hexane (1:3) afforded 3-bromo-6-(4-isobutoxyphenyl)-9-isobutyl-9H-carbazole as white powder (1.8 g, 20% yield).
