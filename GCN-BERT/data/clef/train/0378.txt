Example 24A
Methyl 6-(difluoromethyl)-3-methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylate
100 mg (0.31 mmol) of the compound from Example 23A were dissolved in 5 ml of a THF/methanol mixture (5:1), and 1.53 ml (1.53 mmol) of a 1 M solution of lithium hydroxide in water were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 7 h and then cooled to RT, and ethyl acetate and water were added. The phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was adjusted to pH 1-2 with 1 M hydrochloric acid and extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was stirred in a pentane/tert-butyl methyl ether mixture, and the solids were filtered off and dried under reduced pressure. This gave 61 mg (96% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
