2,5-Dichloro-4-methylpyridine (7 g, 43.2 mmol), 2-methyl-8-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzofuro[2,3-b]pyridine (13.36 g, 43.2 mmol), and potassium carbonate (11.94 g, 86 mmol) were suspended in a mixture of DME (180 ml) and water (10 ml) under nitrogen at room temperature. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) (0.499 g, 0.432 mmol) was added as one portion, the reaction mixture was degassed and heated at 100Â° C. for 14 hours under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was then cooled down to room temperature and the organic phase was separated and filtered. Ethanol (100 ml) was added as one portion and the resulting mixture was stirred, then the white precipitate was filtered off. The remaining solution was evaporated and the residue was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel column, eluted with heptanes/DCM 1/1 (v/v), then heptanes/EtOAc 4/1 (v/v) to yield a white solid, which was combined with the white precipitate. The combined solids were recrystallized from DCM/heptanes, yielding 8-(5-chloro-4-methylpyridin-2-yl)-2-methylbenzofuro[2,3-b]pyridine (11 g, 83% yield).
