Step 4: ethyl 4-fluoropiperidine-4-carboxylate hydrochloride
To a solution of 1-tert-butyl 4-ethyl 4-fluoropiperidine-1,4-dicarboxylate [Example 2, Step 3] (15 g, 54.48 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in dichloromethane (150 mL) was added hydrogen chloride (4M in dioxane) (100 mL). The resulting solution was stirred overnight at 25Â° C. The resulting mixture was concentrated under vacuum to afford 11 g (95%) of ethyl 4-fluoropiperidine-4-carboxylate hydrochloride as a white solid.
