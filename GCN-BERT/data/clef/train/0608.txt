Example 16
Synthesis of 6-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth [1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyridazin-3(2H)-one
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (30 mg, 85.9 µmol), 6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridazine-3-carboxylic acid (31 mg, 0.22 mmol), triethylamine (70 µL, 0.50 mmol), and HATU (129 mg, 0.34 mmol) were reacted. To the reaction solution, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, and then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was suspended in 6% aqueous ammonia, then the suspension was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was subjected to column chromatography (aminosilica gel, 16 g) using methanol and chloroform (concentration gradient, 0 to 30%) as the elution solvent to obtain the title compound (27 mg, 66%) as white solid.
