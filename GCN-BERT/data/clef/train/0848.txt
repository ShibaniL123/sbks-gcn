Step 4
7-(Benzyloxy)-5-hydroxyheptan-3-one
Ethylmagnesium bromide (1.2 mL, 3 M ether solution, 3.5 mmol) was slowly added to a solution of 5-(benzyloxy)-3-hydroxy-N-methoxy-N-methylpentanamide (380 mg, 1.42 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10.0 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction solution was slowly warmed to 0Â°C and stirred for 3 hours. The reaction was quenched with ammonium chloride solution (50 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (6 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined, washed with brine (5.0 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 7-(benzyloxy)-5-hydroxyheptan-3-one (180 mg, as a colorless oil) with a yield of 74%.
