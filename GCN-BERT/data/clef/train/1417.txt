Preparation of (R)-3-(2-((2,2-difluoropropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline
2,2-Difluoropropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (1.68 g, 7.37 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of (R)-3-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methylaniline (1.1 g, 6.7 mmol) and DIPEA (1.52 ml, 8.71 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (20 mL). The reaction was heated at 65Â° C. for 3 hours before being cooled to room temperature and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in EtOAc (30 mL) and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (20 mL) and the combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting red oil was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 30 to 90% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford (R)-3-(2-((2,2-difluoropropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (1.02 g, 63%) as a gum.
