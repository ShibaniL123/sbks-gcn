Preparation of 3-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)-6-chloro-2-fluorobenzoic acid (C318)
To a suspension of ethyl 3-[bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-6-chloro-2-fluorobenzoate (C319; 7.57 g, 18.1 mmol) in a 2:1 mixture of tetrahydrofuran (48 mL) and water (24 mL) was added lithium hydroxide monohydrate (2.28 g, 54.3 mmol), and the resulting turbid mixture was vigorously stirred for 16 hours at room temperature, at which point LC-MS analysis indicated only starting material and the starting material with one of the Boc groups cleaved. The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (25 mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours, at which point LC-MS indicated full consumption of the ester starting material. The organics were evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residual aqueous mixture (cream colored precipitate) was diluted with ethyl acetate (˜200 mL) and vigorously stirred while the pH was adjusted (6-7) by the dropwise addition of 1 N aqueous hydrogen chloride (˜35 mL). The phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with additional ethyl acetate (2×50 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed successively with water (100 mL) and brine (2×75 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The title compound was isolated as a colorless, glassy solid (1.465 g, 27%): mp 79-84° C.;
