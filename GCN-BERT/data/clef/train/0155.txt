Example 53
To a suspension of 6-(2-amino-5-chlorothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one hydrochloride (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol) and 2-cyclopropyl-4-methyl-1,3-oxazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.072 g, 0.428 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.831 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.85 mL, 1.431 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50Â° C. for 5 days and the precipitation formed. After cooling, the precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with cold 1:1 acetonitrile/water to give 2-cyclopropyl-4-methyl-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)oxazole-5-carboxamide (0.143 g, 89%) as a beige solid.
