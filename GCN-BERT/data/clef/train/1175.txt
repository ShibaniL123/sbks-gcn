Preparation Example 4: Preparation of tert-butyl 6-amino-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptane-2-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 6-(1,3-dioxoisoindol-2-yl)-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptane-2-carboxylate (6.0 g, 17.5 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (160 mL), hydrazine hydrate (16 mL) was added under stirring. The stirring was kept at 25Â°C for 1.5 h and a large amount of white precipitates occurred in the reaction solution. After the reaction was completed as measured by LC-MS, filtration was performed, the filtrate was concentrated, ether (200 mL) was added, shaken under ultrasonic, filtration was performed, the filtrate was concentrated, the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane : methanol = 50:1, 0.1% aqueous ammonia added) to obtain the title compound in white color (2.9 g, yield 78.2%).
