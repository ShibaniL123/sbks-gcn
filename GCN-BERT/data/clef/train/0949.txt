N-Acetyl-6-Iodo Anthranilic Acid
Charge a 22 L flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, condenser and heating mantle with 616 grams Magnesium Sulphate (heptahydrate) followed by 10 L water, and 800 grams N-Acetyl-3-Iodo-2-Methyl-Aniline. The mixture is stirred and heated to 85° C., over about an hour, and heat is stopped. Potassium Permanganate (1200 grams, 8 mol) is added in portions over about 2 hours while the temperature rises to 95° C. from the exotherm. After all the KMnO4 is added, the reaction is stirred for 1 hour with the temperature between 80° C. to 90° C. If excess purple permanganate is present, add 20 to 50 cc of Methanol to quench. The mixture is filtered while still not through a large Buchner funnel, and the MnO2 “cake” is washed with hot water. The clear filtrates are cooled to about 20° C., and the acidity is adjusted to pH=1 (paper) with 20% H2SO4. The precipitated product is isolated by filtration and dried. Yield was 623 grams (66%) (Theoretical yield=924 grams). Melting point (m.p.) at 202-205° C.
