Intermediate 66: 6-Iodo-8-methyl-2-propyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Method A:
6-Iodo-8-methyl-2-propyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a solution of 1,2-diamino-5-iodo-3-methylpyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 12) (500 mg, 1.11 mmol) in AcOH (13.1 mL) were added Cu(OAc)2 (101 mg, 0.56 mmol) and butyraldehyde (0.3 mL, 3.34 mmol). The mixture was heated to 70° C. for 18 h, then cooled to room temperature. More Cu(OAc)2 (0.5 equiv) was added and the reaction heated to 70° C. for an additional 4.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc, and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (×2), and the combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound (195 mg, 58%).
