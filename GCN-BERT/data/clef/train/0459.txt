Step 15: preparation of sodium and 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate [5-(2-azaniumethyl)-4,9-dioxo-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-en-10-yl] sulfate (Example 3)
At 0°C, a solution of TFA (155 µL) in DCM (105 µL) was prepared and added to a solution of sodium [5-(2-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)ethyl)-4,9-dioxo-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-en-10-yl] sulfate (3n) (5.7 mg, 0.013 mmol) in DCM (155 µL) at 0°C. The reaction mixture was stirred 30 min at this temperature then concentrated under nitrogen flux. The solid was dissolved in water (1 mL), filtered, frozen and lyophilized to afford sodium and 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate [5-(2-azaniumethyl)-4,9-dioxo-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-en-10-yl] sulfate (Example 3) (3.2 mg, 0.007 mmol, 54%) as a white solid.
