Example I-6 Synthesis of Compound 43
Synthesis of Compound 38
Into a 100 mL round-bottom flask was placed a solution of compound 37 (1.05 g, 6.9 mmol) and DMAP (1.94 g, 15.9 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (20 mL), acryloyl chloride (1.38 g, 15.2 mmol) was added dropwise with stirring at 0° C. The reaction was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of water (50 mL) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (20 mL×3). The organic phase was combined, washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (30 mL), and brine (30 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford compound 38 (1.51 g, 85.8%) as a light yellow semi-solid. LC-MS m/z (ES+), 253.04 (M+H)+.
