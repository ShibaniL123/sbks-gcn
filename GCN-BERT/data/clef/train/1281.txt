(Example 10) Synthesis of 3-(1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1 -yl)-3 -hydroxypropan-1 -one:
Sodium borohydride (0.0560 g, 1.48 mmol) was added to a solution of 1-(1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-3-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)propane-1,3-dione (0.310 g, 0.986 mmol) in methanol (10 mL) at room temperature and the reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 3 hours. A saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate was added to the reaction liquid and the reaction liquid was concentrated under reduced pressure. Distilled water was added to the residue and the reaction liquid was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (NH silica gel, chloroform/methanol) to obtain 3-(1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-hydroxypropan-1-one (0.202 g, 0.639 mmol, 65%) (hereinafter referred to as the compound of Example 10) as a yellow oil.
