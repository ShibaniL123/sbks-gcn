Step 6
5-(2-(Benzyloxy)ethyl)-3-ethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole
3-(2-(Benzyloxy)ethyl)-5-ethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole
1-(Benzyloxy)heptane-3,5-dione (120 mg, 0.513 mmol) and methylhydrazine hydrochloride (423 mg, 5.13 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL). The reaction solution was refluxed for 1.5 hours and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a mixture of 5-(2-(benzyloxy)ethyl)-3-ethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole and 3-(2-(benzyloxy)ethyl)-5-ethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole (100 mg, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 80%.
