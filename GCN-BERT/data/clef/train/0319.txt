4-Chloroacetylacetanilide (1.00 g, 4.72 mmol) and thiourea (0.378 g, 4.96 mmol) suspended in anhydrous ethanol (8 ml) in a sealed tube under argon atmosphere. The sealed tube was microwaved at 120° C. for 30 min. The sealed tube was microwaved at 120° C. for 40 min. The mixture was diluted with tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) and neutralized with 1N aq. NaOH solution and then extracted with ethyl acetate (2×200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by precipitating in dichloromethane and filtration to give N-(4-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)phenyl)acetamide (1.05 g, 95%) as a yellow solid.
