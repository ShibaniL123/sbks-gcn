Step B: 7-(7-Chloro-1H-indazol-5-yl)-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5 -a]pyridine-3-carboxylic acid. A solution of ethyl 7-(7-chloro-1H-indazol-5-yl)-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-c]pyridine-3-carboxylate (120 mg, 0.252 mmol), lithium hydroxide monohydrate (32 mg, 0.763 mmol) and water (650 μL) in 1,4-dioxane (3.2 mL) was stirred at 60° C. for 3 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to rt and stirred for 18 h, followed by heating at 60° C. for 1 h. After cooling to rt, the reaction mixture was acidified to pH 3 by addition of 0.5 M HCl. The mixture was concentrated to remove 1,4-dioxane and the residue was diluted with water (20 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (3×20 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated to give the title compound (55 mg, 48%) as a yellow solid.
