Step 3: Synthesis of methyl 3-(4-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)propanoate
To a solution of 4-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate (1 g, 1 eq) in a mixture of MeOH (30 ml)/THF (10 ml) was added with Et3N (2 ml, 5 eq), formaldehyde (37% in water, 0.5 ml, 2.2 eq) and methyl 2-(methylsulfonyl)propanoate (0.95 g, 2 eq). The mixture was stirred for 24 hr at room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (0.25 g, 21%).
