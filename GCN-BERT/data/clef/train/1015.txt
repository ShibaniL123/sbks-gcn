Synthesis Example 5-2: Synthesis of [Intermediate 5-b]
In a round-bottom flask, Intermediate 5-a (50 g, 204 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (500 ml) were placed, cooled to −78° C., and slowly added with drops of 1.6 M-butyl lithium (128 ml, 204 mmol) before stirring for 1 hours. Drops of acetone (14.3 g, 245 mmol) was slowly added, followed by stirring at room temperature for 6 hours. After completion of the reaction, an aqueous ammonium chloride solution (50 ml) was added to split layers. The organic layer was concentrated in a vacuum and separated by chromatography to afford Intermediate 5-b (38.3 g): yield 62%
