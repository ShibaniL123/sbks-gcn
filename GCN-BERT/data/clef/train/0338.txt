Example 8. Preparation of SM-8: 2,2'-(1,3-phenylenebis(azanediyl))bis(1,1-difluoro-2-oxoethane-1-sulfonyl fluoride)
A 100 mL flask was charged with CH2Cl2 (20.5 ml) under nitrogen stream at 0° C. and then 2-(fluorosulfonyl)difluoroacetyl fluoride (9.39 g, 52.1 mmol, 2.5 eq.) was added and the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes at 0° C. A CH2Cl2 (11 ml) solution of a mixture of 1, 3-phenylenediamine (2.26 g, 20.8 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and pyridine (3.30 g, 41.7 mmol, 2.0 eq.) was added drop-wise to the reaction mixture over 15 minutes. Subsequently, the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature (r.t.) and stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. CH2Cl2 (100 ml) and 1N HCl (50 ml) were added to the final reaction mixture and a solid precipitated. The solid was filtrated and dissolved in Et2O and the solution was washed with 1N HCl (2×20 mL) and brine (2×20 mL). The solution was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and the Et2O was removed in an evaporator. The target compound was obtained as pale yellow solid (8.64 g, 96.7% yield).
