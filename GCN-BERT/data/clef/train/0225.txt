Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
(1S,3R)-1-(5-Bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (0.672 g, 1.59 mmol) in propionic acid (6.63 mL) was cooled to −17° C. (dry ice/acetone). Sodium nitrite (0.110 g, 1.59 mmol) in water (1.33 mL) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture stirred at −17° C. for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was diluted with ice-cold toluene (30 mL), stirred at 0° C. for 15 minutes then at room temperature for 45 minutes. The reaction mixture was washed with water (2×25 mL), the combined aqueous phases washed with EtOAc (25 mL), the combined organics were washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (50 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and the filtrate evaporated to an orange-brown oil. The crude material was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0-50% EtOAc in heptane to afford (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (0.310 g, 45%) as an orange solid.
