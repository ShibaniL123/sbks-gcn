Example 1
Compound 1 (5.00 g, 21.94 mmol) and ethanol (100.0 mL) were added into a dried 250 mL, 3-neck flask, and 1-aminopiperidine 2 (3.30 g, 32.91 mmol) and N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (4.25 g, 32.91 mmol) were then added dropwise slowly at -20 °C. The reaction system was stirred at -20 °C for 3 hours, and then the reaction solution was evaporated and purified by silicagel column to obtain compound 3 (2.9 g, 45.24%) as a white solid.
