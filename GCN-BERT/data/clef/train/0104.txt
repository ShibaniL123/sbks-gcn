Step 3
To Compound 151 (25 mg, 0.047 mmol) in ethanol (0.5 mL) and THF (0.5 mL) solution was added 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution (0.234 mL, 0.467 mmol), the mixture was stirred under reflux for 2 hours. Then, 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added thereto, and the reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (chloroform - methanol) to obtain Compound I-215 (18.8 mg, 77% yield) as a yellow solid.
