5,5'-((((((2,2'-Dimethyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(oxy))bis(4-chloro-6-formyl-3,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))bis(methylene))dinicotinonitrile) (54)
To a stirred solution of 4,4'-(((2,2'-dimethyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(oxy))bis(5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) (600 mg, 1.090 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) at room temperature were added Cs2CO3 (2.13 g, 6.545 mmol) and 5-(chloromethyl)nicotinonitrile (829 mg, 4.39 mmol) and stirred at 90Â° C. for 3 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to remove most of the solvent. The residue was poured into ice-water and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and dried in vacuum to get 5,5'-((((((2,2'-dimethyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(oxy))bis(4-chloro-6-formyl-3,1-phenylene))bis(oxy)) bis(methylene))dinicotinonitrile (700 mg, yield: 82%, LC/MS; 74%) as a brown solid.
