Step 3 Synthesis of compound 66i
A solution of the compound 66h (360 mg, 0.810 mmol) in methanol (10.5 mL) was cooled to -50°C. Sodium borohydride (92.0 mg, 2.43 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at -50°C for 4.5 hours. Then, a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate was filtered off. Then, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to afford the compound 66i (216 mg, 60%).
