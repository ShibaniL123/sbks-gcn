Preparation of 4-isobutoxybenzonitrile
To a 500 mL, three necks, round bottom flask, equipped with the stir bar, thermocouple and nitrogen sweep, was charged 24.59 g of 4-fluorobenzonitrile (1) (FW: 121.1, 203.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 86.0 g of cesium carbonate (FW: 325.82, 264.0 mmol, 1.3 equiv.), 37.5 mL of isobutanol (FW: 74.12, 406.2 mmol, 2.0 equiv.), followed by 150 mL (6 vol.) of DMSO. The resultant mixture was heated to 90° C., and stirred at this temperature for 4.5 hours. HPLC analysis indicated 31 A % of starting material remaining. Additional 14.0 g of cesium carbonate (FW: 325.82, 43.0 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was charged, and the reaction was kept stirring at 90° C. for approximately 24 hours until reaction completion. The batch was cooled down to room temperature and diluted with 500 mL of DI water (20 vol.), extracted with 250 mL (10 vol.) of ethyl acetate. After partition, the product was in the upper organic layer, which was washed with 4×250 mL of DI water before concentrating to dryness under vacuum to afford 34.45 g of 4-isobutoxybenzonitrile as a light yellow liquid, representing a 96.9% yield in 98.7 A % purity.
