Preparation of compound 34-e.
Compound 34-f (1.7 g, 7.36 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solution of ethanol (20 mL) and water (20 mL). Ammonium chloride (2.0 g, 36.79 mmol) and zinc powder (2.4 g, 36.79 mmol) was added thereto. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80°C for 2 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, diluted with water (200 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (200 mL). The organic phase was washed successively with water (50 mL × 3) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to delivera brown oil 34-e (1 g, yield: 68%). This product was used without further purification.
