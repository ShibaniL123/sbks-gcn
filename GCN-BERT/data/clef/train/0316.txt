(3) Preparation of (2S,5R)-2-((2-butyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate
(2S,5R)-N-(2-butyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)-6-hydroxyl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octa ne-2-carboxamide (435 mg, 1.29 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (10 mL), added under stirring with sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex (575 mg, 3.61 mmol), stirred at 25°C for 17h, concentrated, ethyl acetate (50 mL) was added, shaken under ultrasonic, filtrated to obtain white solid, the solid was dissolved in acetonitrile (10 mL), trifluoroacetic acid (0.5 mL) was added, shaken under ultrasonic to generate a white precipitate, suck filtrated, solid was dissolved in water (3 mL), separated by preparative reversed-phase chromatography (acetonitrile : water = 0∼37%) to obtain the title compound in white color (20 mg, yield 3.7%).
