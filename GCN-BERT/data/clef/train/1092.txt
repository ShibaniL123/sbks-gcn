i. Preparation of Compound 105
In a 250 mL round-bottom flask, H-Glu(OtBu)-OtBu.HCl (101) (4.83 g, 16.3 mmol, available from Sigma-Aldrich) and 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate (102) (3.47 g, 17.2 mmol, available from Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL) and stirred in an ice bath under argon. Diisopropylethylamine (6.28 mL, 36.1 mmol) was added slowly, dropwise and the reaction mixture was stirred in the ice bath for 5 min, then warmed to room temperature and stirred for 30 min. H-Lys(Z)-OtBu.HCl (103) (7.01 g, 18.8 mmol) was added portionwise, followed by dropwise addition of diisopropylethylamine (6.54 mL, 37.5 mmol), and stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, then purified by silica gel chromatography in 10-100% ethyl acetate/petroleum ether to yield 104 (8.76 g, 86%, ESI m/z=622.54 [M+H]+).
