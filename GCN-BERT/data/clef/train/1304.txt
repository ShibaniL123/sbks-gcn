6-(Chloroacetyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.300 g, 1.34 mmol) and urea (1.61 g, 26.82 mmol) dissolve in anhydrous acetonitrile (30 ml) in a flask under argon atmosphere. The mixture refluxed for 15 days. After cooling, the precipitate was filtered away and the filtrate was extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (3×20 mL) over sat. NaHCO3 (2×50 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography over silica gel using 95:5 dichloromethane/methanol to give 6-(2-aminooxazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.058 g, 19%) as a peach solid.
