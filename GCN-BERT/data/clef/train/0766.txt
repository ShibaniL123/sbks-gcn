A reaction mixture of 6-amino-1-ethylbenzo[cd]indol-2(1H)-one (100 mg, 0.47 mmol) and (3-chloropropyl)benzene (73 mg, 0.47 mmol) in CH3CN (20 mL) was stirred at rt. K2CO3 (195 mg, 1.41 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, and stirred at 70° C. for overnight. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (150 mL×2). The organic layer was washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4. The solid was filtered off, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (5/1, v/v) to yield 1-ethyl-6-((3-phenylpropyl)amino)benzo[cd]indol-2(1H)-one (60 mg, 38%) as a yellow solid.
