The fifth step
To a solution of Compound 9 (460mg, 0.947mmol) in DMF (4.60mL) was added sodium hydride (60% wt) (95.0 mg, 2.37 mmol) under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for one hour and 42 minutes. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of ice water and 2 mol / L aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and saturated brine successively, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was solidified with hexane-ethyl acetate to yield Compound 10 (288mg, yield 67.7%).
