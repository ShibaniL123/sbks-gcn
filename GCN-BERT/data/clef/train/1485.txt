Step 3
Under ice-cooling, to Compound 201 (990 mg, 1.88 mmol) in methanol (10 mL) was added sodium borohydride (71.1 mg, 1.88 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 0Â°C for 20 min. 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 202 (790 mg, 71% yield) as a pink solid.
