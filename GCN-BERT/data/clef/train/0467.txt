Synthesis of Compound A-1
A solution of N-phenyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-amine (0.64 g, 2.61 mmol) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (5 mL) was bubbled with nitrogen gas for 30 mins, boron tribromide (1M in dichloromethane, 4 mL, 4.00 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 180° C. for 3 hours. After cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature (22° C.), diphenylzine (1.27 g, 5.78 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture inside the glovebox. The reaction mixture was heated to 120° C. for 6 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature (22° C.), water was added and the reaction mixture was extracted with diethyl ether (×3). The combined organic layer was washed with water and brine solution in this sequence, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography with dichloromethane-hexane (1:9 to 2:8) to give Compound A-1 (0.68 g, 80% yield) as white solid.
