Example 69: Synthesis of compound 11331, N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)-1-propionylazetidine-3-carboxamide
N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)azetidine-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (0.050 g, 0.109 mmol), synthesized in step 5 of Example 63, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.038 mL, 0.219 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and propionyl chloride (0.011 mL, 0.120 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 4 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 90%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.018 g, 34.5%) as a white solid.
