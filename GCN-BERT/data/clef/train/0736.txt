Step 1-6, preparation of 3-[4-(4-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-7-chloro-3-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-cinnolin-6-yl]-5-fluoro-benzamide: A solution of {1-[6-(3-carbamoyl-5-fluoro-phenyl)-7-chloro-3-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-cinnolin-4-yl]-piperidin-4-yl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (30 mg, 0.049 mmol) and TFA (0.3 mL) in DCM (1.5 mL) was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. After removal of the volatile solvent, the residue was directly purified by using a reverse phase C18 column to afford the title compound (15.5 mg, 62%). MS (M+H)+=508.4.
