Step 1. 2-(Diethoxymethyl)imidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine
A solution of 1-amino-1H-imidazole-2-carbonitrile (0.533 g, 4.93 mmol) in ethanol (7.0 mL) in a microwave vial was treated with a solution of methyl 2,2-diethoxyacetimidate (0.954 g, 5.92 mmol) in ethanol (2.9 mL) over 2-3 min and stirred at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction mixture was treated with triethylamine (0.687 mL, 4.93 mmol) over 1 min and heated in a microwave at 120Â° C. for 2 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated, diluted with DCM, and concentrated again. The residue was diluted with ethyl acetate and water. Brine was added to help with the emulsion. The aqueous layer was separated and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to a brown oil. Purification by flash column chromatography using methanol in dichloromethane (0%-5%) gave the desired product (858 mg, 64.6%). LCMS for C10H15N5O2Na (M+Na)+: m/z=260.1; Found: 260.1.
