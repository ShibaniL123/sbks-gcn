Step 2: 2-(2-chloropyrimidin-4-ylamino)phenol
2-Chloro-N-(2-methoxyphenyl)pyrimidin-4-amine (100 mg, 0.42 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (3 mL) and cooled in an ice-water bath. A solution (2.5 mL, 2.12 mmol) of boron tribromide in dichloromethane was slowly added dropwise and the resulting mixture was allowed to naturally warm to room temperature, and stirring was continued for 2 hours. The reaction was quenched with the addition of saturated ammonium chloride solution, and then the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (20 mL*3). The organic phases were combined and washed with saturated brine, and the solvent was removed under vacuum to give the title compound (84 mg, 89%).
