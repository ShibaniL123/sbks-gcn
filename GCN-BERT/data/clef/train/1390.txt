1-((R)-1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-6-((3'R,4'S)-3'-methyl-[1,4'-bipiperidin]-1'-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-3-carbonitrile hydrochloride
Step 1. (R)-6-Chloro-1-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-3-carboxamide
To a solution of ethyl (R)-6-chloro-1-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-3-carboxylate (Example 5, Step 4, 4 g, 10 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (40 mL) at room temperature was added ammonium hydroxide (29% in water, 40 mL). The mixture was stirred in a sealed tube at room temperature for 3 d. The mixture was diluted with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (2Ã—). The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the title compound (3.4 g, 92% yield) as a light yellow solid.
