Step 1-2: N-((2,4-dichloropyrimidin-5-yl) methyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroaniline
2,4-Dichloro-5-(chloromethyl)pyrimidine (2.4 g, 12.2 mmol) and 2-methyl-5-nitroaniline (1.48 g, 9.76 mmol) were dissolved in acetone (12 mL), then sodium iodide (2.2 g, 14.6 mmol) and potassium carbonate (2.5 g, 18.3 mmol) were added, and the mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 24 hours. When the reaction was completed, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered using a celite pad. The filtrate was extracted with dichloromethane and water. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography to obtain the desired compound (2.83 g, 74.3%) as a yellow solid.
