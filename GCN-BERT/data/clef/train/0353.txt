Example 1
Synthesis of 2-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyridine 1-oxide
To a 50-mL round bottom flask, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (31 mg, 87 µmol) synthesized in Reference Example 1, 2-carboxypyridine 1-oxide (32 mg, 0.23 mmol), and HATU (125 mg, 0.33 mmol) were added, and suspended in THF (1.5 mL), then triethylamine (70 µL, 0.50 mmol) and DMA (200 µL) were added to the suspension, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. To the reaction mixture, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol (2 mL) was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, the obtained residue was suspended in 6% aqueous ammonia, and the suspension was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with saturated brine, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was subjected to column chromatography (aminosilica gel, 16 g) using methanol and chloroform (concentration gradient, 0 to 50%) as the elution solvent to obtain the title compound (18 mg, 44%) as white solid.
