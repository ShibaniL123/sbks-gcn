(Example 12)
The first step
To a solution of Compound 58 (850mg, 1.91mmol) and 3-bromoprop-1-yne (455mg, 3.82mmol) in DMF (5mL) was added 60% sodium hydride (153mg, 3.82mmol) under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 0 °C. After the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, water was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in ethanol (20 mL) and water (3 mL), ammonium chloride (1.02 g, 19.1 mmol) and iron powder (1.07 g, 19.1 mmol) was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred for 4 hours at 90 °C. After the insoluble materials were removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was extracted with chloroform after addition of chloroform and water. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 59 (251 mg, yield 29%).
