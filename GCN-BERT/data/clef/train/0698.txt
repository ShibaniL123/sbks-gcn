Example 6-(1-Benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl (S)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-(4-(4-((((R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethyl)amino)methyl)piperidine-1-carbonyl)pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-2-phenylacetate (Compound 6)
Step 1: (R)-8-(Benzyloxy)-5-(2-(((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)amino)-1-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)quinolin-2(1H)-one
A mixture of (R)-8-(benzyloxy)-5-(2-bromo-1-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)quinolin-2(1H)-one (2.39 g, 4.90 mmol) in NMP (4 mL) was added with (1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methanamine (5 g, 24.5 mmol). The mixture was heated at 80° C. for 18 hours. The mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed sequentially with water (×2) and brine (×2). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the filtrate was evaporated. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% DCM to 40:1 DCM/7M NH3/MeOH) to afford the title compound (2.65 g, 88%).
