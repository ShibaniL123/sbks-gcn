(E)-Ethyl hex-4-enoate (14). Neat propionic acid (126.2 μL, 125.2 mg, 1.681 mmol) was added to a mixture of 3-buten-2-ol (25.00 g, 336.3 mmol) and triethyl orthoacetate (100 mL, 86.73 g, 534.6 mmol) in a 3-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser over a liquid addition funnel. The magnetically stirred solution was heated to 135° C. under nitrogen. Every 2 h, the funnel was closed and a sample of the condensate was analyzed by NMR. When no more starting alcohol was found in the distillate, the reaction was brought to room temperature and water (30 mL) was added. Stirring was continued for 30 min, and the low-boiling components were distilled off with minimal vacuum, using an additional 30 mL ethanol to remove residual water. Then, a higher vacuum was applied to distill the product. Column chromatography (20% dichloromethane in hexanes) led to the product (21.535 g, 151.44 mmol, 45%) as a clear, volatile liquid, and significant amounts of 3-buten-2-yl hex-4-enoate as a side product (yield not determined).
