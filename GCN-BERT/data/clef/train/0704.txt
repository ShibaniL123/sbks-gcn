Example 53A
Methyl 4-({[6-bromo-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-methylquinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
At RT, 58 mg (0.27 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, 151 mg (0.40 mmol) of HATU and 0.14 ml (0.80 mmol) of DIPEA were added successively to a solution of 100 mg (0.27 mmol) of the compound from Example 11A in 1 ml of DMF. The mixture was then stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, the mixture was purified directly (without further work-up) by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 80 mg (54% of theory, purity 98%) of the title compound
