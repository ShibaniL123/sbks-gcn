Example 12
Synthesis of 5-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (32 mg, 90 µmol), 2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid monohydrate (35 mg, 0.20 mmol), triethylamine (70 µL, 0.50 mmol), and HATU (114 mg, 0.30 mmol) were reacted. To the reaction solution, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, and then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was suspended in saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and the suspension was extracted three times with a 5:1 mixed solution of chloroform and methanol. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was subjected to preparative TLC using methanol containing 10% concentrated aqueous ammonia and chloroform (concentration, 25%) as the developing solvent to obtain the title compound (16 mg, 35%) as white solid.
