1-(2-Methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-6-[(2-oxoimidazolidin-1-yl)(dideutero)methyl]-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
To a solution of 117 mg (1.36 mmol) of imidazolidin-2-one in 3 ml of DMF were added 54 mg (1.36 mmol) of sodium hydride (60% suspension in mineral oil), then the mixture was heated to 60° C. for 5 min and subsequently cooled back down to RT (“Solution 1”). To a solution of 120 mg (0.339 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 511A in 2.4 ml of dichloromethane in another reaction vessel were added, at 0° C., 118 μl (0.677 mmol) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and 26 μl (0.356 mmol) of thionyl chloride. After 20 min, Solution 1 was added in portions at 0° C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at RT for 3.5 days. Then it was admixed with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic extract was washed with saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate. After filtration and concentration, the residue was first prepurified by means of MPLC (Isolera, 25 g silica gel cartridge, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 1:1→dichloromethane/methanol 10:1). The concentrated product-containing fractions were then purified further in a second chromatography step by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8).
Reconcentration and drying of the product-containing fractions were followed by a third chromatography operation for further purification (likewise by preparative HPLC). After concentration of the product fractions and drying under high vacuum once again, 27 mg (18% of theory) of the title compound were thus obtained.
