(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxy-benzylamino)-5-(2-isopropyl-phenyl)-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester
Trifluoroacetic acid (CAS#76-05-1, 350 Î¼L) was added to a solution of protected (2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxy-benzylamino)-5-(2-isopropyl-phenyl)-pyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylic acid 1-tert-butyl ester 2-ethyl ester (145 mg, 0.25 mmol, 1.0 eq) in dichloromethane. The reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight, then the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was partitioned between dichloromethane and NaHCO3 saturated aqueous solution. The organic phase was concentrated to dryness and the residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane/methanol 100/0 to 97/3) to provide the title compound (90 mg, 70%). LC/MS (ESI+) m/z 509.8 (M+H)+.
