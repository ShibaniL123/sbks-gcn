(7) Preparation of (2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylic acid
Benzyl (2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylate (2 g, 5.46 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL), the solution of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (0.3 g, 7.14 mmol) in water (5 mL) was added, stirred and reacted at 25 °C for 16 h. Water (20 mL) and ethyl acetate (20 mL) were added, stirred for 5 min. The phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was washed with ethyl acetate (10 mL). Diluted hydrochloric acid (11 mol/L) was added to regulate pH value to 2-3. The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL×3), and the organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtrated, concentrated to obtain the title compound as a white solid (1.2 g, yield 80 %).
