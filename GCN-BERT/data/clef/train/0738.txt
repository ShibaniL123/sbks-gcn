Step 3: Preparation of (S)-2-(1-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-3-phenylquinazoline-4(3H)-one
1.634 g (4.09 mmol) of tert-butyl (S)-(1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)carbamate prepared in step 2 was dissolved in dichloromethane (15 mL), to which trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 5 mL) was added. After the reflux at 40Â° C. for 3 hours, the mixture was cooled down at room temperature, to which saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution was slowly added to neutralize the mixture. The organic layer was extracted by using ethyl acetate, which was washed with saturated brine, separated, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent:
dichloromethane/methanol, 20/1 - dichloromethane/methanol, 5/1) to give 1.046 g of the target compound (S)-2-(1-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-3-phenylquinazoline-4(3H)-one as a white solid (3.49 mmol, yield: 85%).
