Example 51
4-{[(6-Bromo-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt
100 ml of ethanol were added to 2.0 g (4.05 mmol) of the compound from Example 1, and the mixture was heated to the boil. A solution of 706 mg (4.05 mmol) of L-(+)-arginine in 10 ml of water was added to the hot solution. After cooling to RT, the mixture was left to stand at RT under air until the solvent had evaporated. After decanting, 2.81 g of the title compound were obtained (quant., purity 100%, contains ethanol).
