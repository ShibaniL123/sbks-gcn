Step 3 Synthesis of Compound 25
Compound Z (113 mg, 0.383 mmol) which was synthesized in step 5 of Example 3, Compound 24 (180 mg, 0.383 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (334 ÂµL, 1.91 mmol) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (1.9 mL), and the solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. Sodium hydrogen carbonate aqueous solution was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with brine and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was purified by silicagel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to give Compound 25 (racemate, 117 mg, Yield 48%).
