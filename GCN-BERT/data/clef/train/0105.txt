Step 1. 3-Bromo-4-methoxy-1H-pyrazole
To a solution of 4-methoxy-1H-pyrazole (71 mg, 0.70 mmol) (Synthonix, M20056) in DMF (4.7 mL) was added N-bromosuccinimide (130 mg, 0.70 mmol). After stirring at rt for 2 h, the reaction mixture was diluted with DCM and poured into sat. Na2S2O3. The organic layer was removed, and the aqueous layer was extracted twice more with DCM. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (10-80% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (77 mg, 62%). LCMS for C4H6BrN2O (M+H)+: calculated m/z=177.0, 179.0; found 177.0, 178.9.
