Step 3: Synthesis of 3-(2-fluoro-4-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)phenyl)-N,N-dimethylprop-2-yn-1-amine hydrochloride
To a solution of tert-butyl 4-(4-(3-(dimethylamino)prop-1-yn-1-yl)-3-fluorophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxylate (2 g, 1 eq) in MeOH (16 ml) was added with acetyl chloride (3.97 ml, 10 eq). The mixture was stirred for 3 hr at 60Â° C. and cooled down to room temperature, and the solvent was concentrated in vacuo to prepare the title compound (1.6 g, 97%).
