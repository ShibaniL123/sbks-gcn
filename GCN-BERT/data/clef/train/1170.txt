Step 4: methyl 5-bromo-2-(cyanomethoxy)(3,4-d2)benzoate
To a solution of methyl 5-bromo-2-hydroxy(3,4-d2)benzoate [Example 7, Step 3] (4 g, 17.16 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in DMA (50 mL) was added 2-chloroacetonitrile (1.62 g, 21.46 mmol, 1.25 equiv) and potassium carbonate (3.57 g, 25.83 mmol, 1.50 equiv). The resulting suspension was stirred at room temperature overnight. Then the resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3Ã—50 mL). The organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to afford 3.7 g (79%) of methyl 5-bromo-2-(cyanomethoxy)(3,4-d2)benzoate as a white solid.
