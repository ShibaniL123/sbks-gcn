Example 53A
3-(2-Methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbaldehyde
1.94 ml (20.8 mmol) of phosphorus oxychloride were added cautiously, while cooling with an ice bath, to a solution of 500 mg (2.08 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 47A in 19.5 ml of DMF. The mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 3 h. Then the reaction mixture was concentrated very substantially on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was added to ice-water and stirred. The precipitated product was filtered off with suction, washed to neutrality with water and dried. 530 mg (93% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
