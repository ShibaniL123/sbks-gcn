Example 6. Synthetic Procedure for the Preparation of Inhibitor 7
A. 2', 3'-O-isopropylidene Adenosine (11)
To adenosine (2.02 g, 7.56 mmol) suspended in acetone (150 ml) was added catalytic amount of perchloric acid (0.91 ml) drop-wise while under ice-bath. The milky white reaction mixture turned clear after 2 hours of stirring. The solution was then neutralized using two equivalent of ammonium hydroxide under ice-bath. The reaction mixture was then evaporated to under rotary evaporator to complete dryness and purified using flash silica gel chromatography (gradient: 0% for 4 min, 0-15% for 4-10 min and eluted at 15% MeOH:dichloromethane). The fractions containing the product were evaporated to obtain the product (2.3 g, 3.58 mmol) in 99% yield. The
