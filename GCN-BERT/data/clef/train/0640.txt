Example 2
Synthesis of 4-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6, 11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyridine 1-oxide
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6, 11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (36 mg, 0.10 mmol), 4-carboxypyridine 1-oxide(42 mg, 0.30 mmol), triethylamine (70 ÂµL, 0.50 mmol), and HATU (108 mg, 0.28 mmol) were reacted. The reaction solution was directly subjected to column chromatography (silica gel, 10 g) using methanol and ethyl acetate containing 5% triethylamine (concentration gradient, 10 to 50%) as the elution solvent, and thereby purified. The obtained syrup was dissolved in methanol, then powdered by adding chloroform and tert-butyl methyl ether to the solution, and then collected by filtration to obtain the title compound (30 mg, 62%) as weakly brown solid.
