[Step 2] Synthesis of methyl 4-((2-(benzyloxy)-N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)acetamido)methyl)-3-fluorobenzoate
2-(Benzyloxy)-N-(4-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)acetamide (1.880 g, 6.401 mmol), synthesized in step 1, and calcium carbonate (1.327 g, 9.601 mmol) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) at 0Â°C, and methyl 4-(bromomethyl)-3-fluorobenzoate (1.898 g, 7.681 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 40 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 50%) and concentrated to give the title compound (1.780 g, 60.5%) as yellow oil.
