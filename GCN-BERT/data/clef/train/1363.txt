Example 25
Preparation of tert-butyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-N-[3-[[2-chloro-5-[[(1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-carbonyl]amino]-3-fluorobenzoyl]amino]-2,6-difluorophenyl]carbamate (F1239)
To a solution of 2-chloro-5-((1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-3-fluorobenzoic acid (C1) (0.360 g, 0.79 mmol) in ethyl acetate (2.5 mL) were added tert-butyl N-(3-amino-2,6-difluoro-phenyl)-N-tert-butoxycarbonylcarbamate (C182) (0.327 g, 0.95 mmol), and pyridine (0.188 g, 0.191 mL, 2.37 mmol) followed by a 50% solution of 2,4,6-tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (0.94 mL, 1.58 mmol) in ethyl acetate, and the resulting gold solution was warmed to 45° C. and stirred for 68 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated and the viscous, amber residue was dissolve in minimal methylene chloride (˜3 mL) and adsorbed to Celite®. The adsorbed material was purified by automated flash chromatography using a gradient of 0-25% ethyl acetate in hexanes as eluent to give the title compound (0.166 g, 87%) as a white solid.
