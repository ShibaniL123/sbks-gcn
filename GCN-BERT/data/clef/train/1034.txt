A 150 mL sealable flask was charged with water (50.9 mL) and benzylamine (10.9 g, 11.1 mL, 102 mmol), then purged with nitrogen for 5 min, before 1-methyl-6-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane (CAS#16240-42-9, 10 g, 102 mmol) was added. The flask was sealed and heated at 100° C. for 18 h, at which time a biphasic mixture was observed. After cooling to room temperature the flask was further cooled in an ice-water bath. Concentrated aqueous HCl (˜12 M, 13 mL) was added to bring the pH to 1. The organic impurities were extracted with EtOAc (150 mL) and set aside. The acidic aqueous layer was cooled in an ice-water bath and adjusted to pH 10 using 5N aq NaOH. The resulting biphasic mixture was extracted with EtOAc (250 mL×3). The combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to a brown oil. The remaining benzylamine was evaporated under higher vacuum (˜5 mmHg) at 80° C. for several h, until 1HNMR of a sample showed only ˜20 mole % benzylamine remaining. The residual oil was triturated with heptane (100 mL), causing white crystals to form. The crystals were collected by filtration and dried to give (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-(benzylamino)-1-methylcyclopentanol (2a, 13 g, 62%) as a white crystalline solid.
