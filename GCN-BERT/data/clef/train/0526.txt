Step 3
3-Chloro-4-fluorobenzylamine (20 g, 125 mmol) and a 2 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (80 mL, 160 mmol) were added to an ethanol (80 mL) solution of the compound 48 (19.4 g, 114 mmol) at room temperature. The mixture was stirred at 90Â°C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. Water was added to the residue. The mixture was washed by chloroform. A 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution was added to the obtained aqueous layer. The yellow precipitated solids were filtered, and dried under reduced pressure to give the compound 49 (18.6 g, yield 52%).
