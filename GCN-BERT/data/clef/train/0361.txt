Preparation of trans-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-N-(4-fluoro-3-vinylphenyl)benzamide (F1311)
To a solution of trans-N-(3-bromo-4-fluorophenyl)-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide (F1304) (0.4 g, 0.64 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (7 mL) degassed with argon were added tributylvinyltin (0.26 mL, 0.89 mmol) and bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride (0.044 g, 0.064 mmol), and the reaction mixture was irradiated in a microwave at 90° C. for 1 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate (2×10 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography using 15-20% ethyl acetate/petroleum ether as eluent afforded the title compound as an off-white solid (0.11 g, 40%).
