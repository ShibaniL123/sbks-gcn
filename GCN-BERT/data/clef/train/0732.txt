Compound 11a (13.7 g, 73.9 mmol), compound 11b (10 g, 49.3 mmol), potassium iodide (81.8 mg, 0.493 mmol) and potassium carbonate (13.6 g, 98.6 mmol) were added into DMSO (100 mL). The reaction solution was stirred at 120 Â°C overnight and then cooled to room temperature, adjusted to pH 7 with hydrochloric acid (1 mol) and then extracted with dichloromethane. The aqueous phase was alkalize by saturated solution of sodium carbonate, and then extracted with dichloromethane again. The organic phase was combined and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated and then slurried by water to give compound 11c (9.2 g, 60%).
