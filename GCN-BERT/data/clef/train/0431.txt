84.2: 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-isobutyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydrobenzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 84)
Similarly to example 13.4, starting from 215 mg (0.6 mmol) of [5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid and 164 mg (0.7 mmol) of 3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one (prepared as described in example 16.4), and after recrystallization from acetone, 140 mg (38%) of 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-isobutyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a beige solid with a melting point of 248Â° C.
