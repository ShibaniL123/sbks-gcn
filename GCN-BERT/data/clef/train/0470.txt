Preparation of trans-2,6-dichloro-3-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-N-(2,4-difluorophenyl)benzamide (F1105)
To a solution of trans-2,2-dichloro-3-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (C40) (0.040 g, 0.14 mmol), 3-amino-2,6-dichloro-N-(2,4-difluorophenyl)benzamide (C129), (0.045 g, 0.14 mmol), and pyridine (0.034 g, 0.43 mmol) in ethyl acetate (4 mL) was added a 50% solution of 2,4,6-tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (0.17 mL, 0.28 mmol) in ethyl acetate. The resulting colorless solution was stirred at 50° C. for 16 hours and cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was adsorbed to Celite® (˜1.5 g) and purified by automated flash chromatography using a gradient of 0-55% ethyl acetate in Hexanes as eluent to give the title compound as a white solid (0.083 g, 100%).
