Method H (Curtius Rearrangement at C-6)
Example 137: 6-amino-2-{[1-(but-3-yn-1-ylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino}-8-cyclopentylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one
Diphenyl phosphoryl azide (5.41 g, 19.6 mmol) was added to a room temperature solution of 8-cyclopentyl-2-(methylthio)-7-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acid [Toogood, et al. J. Med. Chem., 2005, 48, 2388-2406] (5.0 g, 16.37 mmol) and triethylamine (1.99 g, 19.6 mmol) in tert-butanol (60 mL). The resulting suspension was stirred at 79Â° C. for 18 h. The solids were removed by filtration. The filter cake was rinsed with ethyl acetate (50 mL) and the combined filtrates concentrated and purified by silica gel chromatography (eluting with pet. ether/ethyl acetate) to give tert-butyl (8-cyclopentyl-2-(methylthio)-7-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)-carbamate (137A, 4.1 g, 67%) as a light yellow solid.
