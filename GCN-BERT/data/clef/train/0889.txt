Step 2
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahy drobenzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
N-(1-(benzo[b]thiophen-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine 5b (30 mg, 0.113 mmol), (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-formylphenyl)acrylate 1e (31 mg, 0.136 mmol) and triisopropylsilyl chloride (109 mg, 0.565 mmol) were dissolved in 1.5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide and placed in a sealed tube. The reaction mixture was heated to 140°C. After stirring for 6 hours, the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure and extracted with ethyl acetate (5 mL×3). The organic phases were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)a crylate 5c (10 mg, yield 20%) as a yellow oil.
