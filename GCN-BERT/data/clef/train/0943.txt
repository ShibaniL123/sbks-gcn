Synthesis of N-biphenyl-4-yl-N'-phenyl-1,2-benzenediamine
To 660 mL of degassed toluene are added 0.35 g (1.58 mmol) of Pd(OAc)2 and 4.8 mL (4.86 mmol) of tri-tert-butylphosphine (1M solution in toluene), and the mixture is stirred for 5 min. Then 37.2 g (160 mmol) of 4-bromobiphenyl, 29.4 g (160 mmol) of N-phenyl-o-phenylenediamine and 22.4 g (233 mmol) of sodium Cert-butoxide are added to the solution, which is then degassed and stirred at 140Â° C. under a protective gas atmosphere for 10 h. After cooling, 200 mL of NH4Cl solution and 50 mL of ethyl acetate are added to the solution, and the phases are separated, washed with water, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated. The solids are dissolved in toluene and the mixture is filtered through Celite. The crude product is stirred with hot heptane and washed with MeOH. This gives 47 g (140 mmol) of a crystalline solid. The overall yield is 80%.
