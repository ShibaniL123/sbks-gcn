[Step 2] Synthesis of N-(2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)butyramide
Methyl 3-fluoro-4-((N-(3-fluorophenyl)butyramido)methyl)benzoate (0.103 g, 0.297 mmol), synthesized in step 1, and hydrazine monohydrate (0.288 mL, 5.930 mmol) were mixed in ethanol (6 mL) at room temperature, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 18 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The title compound was used without further purification (0.100 g, 97.1%) as colorless oil.
