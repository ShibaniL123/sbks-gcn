A mixture of pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (3.87 g, 10 mmol), 4-phenoxyphenol (7.44 g, 40 mmol), potassium carbonate (8.28 g, 60 mmol), and DMF (15 mL) was stirred under argon and heated at 110Â° C. for 24 h. After cooling, the reaction mixture was poured into water (200 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate/toluene (200+300 mL). The extract was washed with water (200 mL), and the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. Column chromatography of the residue (silica gel, hexane/toluene, 1:1) afforded Compound B5, 4,4'-((2-(Bromomethyl)-2-((4-phenoxyphenoxy)methyl)propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(phenoxybenzene), (3.71 g, 53% yield).
