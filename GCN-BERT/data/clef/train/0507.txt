N-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine
4N HCl in dioxane (0.25 mL, 0.99 mmol) was added to a solution of N-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (58 mg, 0.10 mmol) in methanol (0.30 mL) and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The volatiles were evaporated and the residue was suspended in saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (30 mL) and extracted with DCM (Ã—2). The organic phase was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated. The crude residue was purified by silica gel chromatography and eluted using a gradient of 0 to 10% 1M NH3/MeOH in DCM. Product containing fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydr-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (45.4 mg, 91%) as a white solid.
