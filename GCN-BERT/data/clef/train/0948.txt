Step 2
4,4'-(((2,2'-dimethyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(oxy))bis(3-methylbenzaldehyde) (22)
To a stirred solution of 3,3'-bis(bromomethyl)-2,2'-dimethylbiphenyl (1 g, 2.732 mmol) in ACN (20 mL) at room temperature were added K2CO3 (1.5 g, 10.928 mmol) and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbenzaldehyde (1.2 g, 8.196 mmol) and stirred at 80Â° C. for 3 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to remove most of the solvent. The residue was poured into ice-water and the resulting precipitate was filtered and dried in vacuum to get 4,4'-(((2,2'-dimethyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(oxy))bis(3-methylbenzaldehyde) (1.1 g, yield: 67%, LC/MS 95%);
