The compound 39b (2.02 g, 10.0 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (25.0 mL). The solution was cooled to -30Â°C. Methylhydrazine (0.583 mL, 11.0 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The precipitates were removed. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (25.0 mL). The compound 39c (2.72 g, 10.0 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated. Ethyl acetate, purified water, and a 2 mol/L aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid were added to the obtained residue, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by purified water and then brine, dried using anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The obtained filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The precipitates were collected by filtration and washed by ethyl acetate to afford the compound 39d (1.88 g, yield 58%).
