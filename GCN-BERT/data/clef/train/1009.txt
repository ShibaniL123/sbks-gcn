Intermediate 42: 7-Chloro-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5 -a]pyridine
Step A: 7-Chloro-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-c]pyridine-3-carboxylic acid. To a suspension of ethyl 7-chloro-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-c]pyridine-3-carboxylate (535 mg, 1.48 mmol) in a mixture of 1,4-dioxane and water (5:1, 22.2 mL) was added lithium hydroxide monohydrate (93 mg, 2.21 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 60° C. for 1 h. Additional lithium hydroxide monohydrate (62 mg, 1.48 mmol) was added, and the stirring was continued at 60° C. for 1.5 h. After cooling to rt, the mixture was acidified to pH 3 by addition of 1 M HCl, and then the solvents were removed in vacuo. The residue was taken up in water (40 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (2×100 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (1×30 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 5% IPA/Et2O) afforded the title compound (185 mg, 37%) as a white crystalline solid.
