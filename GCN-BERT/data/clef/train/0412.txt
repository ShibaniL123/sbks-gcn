Example 3: Synthesis of compound 11106, N-phenyl-N-(4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide
[Step 1] Synthesis of 4-((N-phenylcyclohexanecarboxamido)methyl)benzoate
Methyl 4-((phenylamino)methyl)benzoate (0.200 g, 0.829 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.290 mL, 1.658 mmol) were dissolved in methylene chloride (10 mL) at room temperature, and cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride (0.166 mL, 1.243 mmol) was added to the solution, followed by stirring at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 50%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.285 g, 97.8%) as a white solid.
