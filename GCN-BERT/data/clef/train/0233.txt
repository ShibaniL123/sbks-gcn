Step 18: preparation of trans-10-allyloxy-7-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undeca-2(6),4-dien-9-one (6r)
To a solution of oxalyl chloride (0.1 mL, 1.18 mmol) in DCM (9 mL) under inert atmosphere at -65°C was dropwise added dimethyl sulfoxide (0.168 mL, 2.36 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 30 min then a solution of trans-10-allyloxy-7-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-3-ium-2-yl)-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undeca-2(6),4-dien-9-one trifluoroacetate (6q) (0.247 g, 0.59 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (9 mL) was dropwise added. After 5 min at -65°C, TEA (0.821 mL, 5.89 mmol) was added and the temperature was raised to -15°C over 3 h. The reaction mixture was quenched with water and the product was extracted with DCM. The brown oil was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (heptane/acetone 100/0 to 0/100) to give trans-10-allyloxy-7-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undeca-2(6),4-dien-9-one (6r) (0.059 g, 0.19 mmol, 32%) as an off-white solid.
