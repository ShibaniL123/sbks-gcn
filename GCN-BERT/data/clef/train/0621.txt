EXAMPLE 164
5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-[2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-yl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl]pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme No. 4, compound 164)
164.1: 4-(2-chloro-pyridin-3-ylamino)-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester
23 mL (311 mmol) of trifluoroacetic acid is added after 5 minutes to a solution of 20 g (156 mmol) of 3-amino-2-chloropyridine and 26 mL (171 mmol) of 4-oxo-1-piperidine ethyl carboxylate in 250 mL of isopropyl acetate. The reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and then 40 g (19 mmol) of sodium triacetoxyborohydride is added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hours at room temperature and then 23 mL of a 10% solution of sodium hydroxide is added to pH8-9 and the mixture is heated to 50Â° C. After cooling, the reaction mixture is decanted and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are combined, and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvents are evaporated and the residue is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a heptane/ethyl acetate 60/40 mixture. 43.2 g (98%) of 4-(2-chloro-pyridin-3-ylamino)-piperidine-1-ethyl carboxylate is obtained in the form of a colourless oil.
