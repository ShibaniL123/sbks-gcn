Example 21: Synthesis of compound 11160,
1-(methylsulfonyl)-N-phenyl-N-(4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)azetidine-3-carboxamide
N-phenyl-N-(4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)azetidine-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (0.080 g, 0.182 mmol), synthesized in Example 10, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.064 mL, 0.365 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.016 mL, 0.201 mmol) was added to the solution, followed by stirring at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 4 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 80%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.018 g, 20.6%) as a white solid.
