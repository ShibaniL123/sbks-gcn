Example 50A
Methyl 4-({[6-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-methylquinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
At RT, 61 mg (0.28 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, 158 mg (0.42 mmol) of HATU and 0.15 ml (0.83 mmol) of DIPEA were added successively to a solution of 100 mg (0.28 mmol) of the compound from Example 8A in 1 ml of DMF. The mixture was then stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, the mixture was purified directly (without further work-up) by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 68 mg (46% of theory, purity 98%) of the title compound
