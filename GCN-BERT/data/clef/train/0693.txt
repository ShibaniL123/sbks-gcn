Step 4
3-((3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl)cyclohexylmethyl methanesulfonate
3-((3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl)cyclohexanol (300 mg, 1.54 mmol) and triethylamine (311 mg, 3.08 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL) and methanesulfonyl chloride (264 mg, 2.31 mmol) was added at 0Â°C. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, diluted with dichloromethane (20 mL), washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (30 mLx2), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (4:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.5) to give 3-((3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl)cyclohexylmethyl methanesulfonate (400 mg, as a colorless oil) with a yield of 96%.
