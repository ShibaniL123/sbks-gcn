Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl) oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Sodium nitrite (0.130 g, 1.89 mmol) in water (0.900 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2, 6-difluorophenyl)-2-(3-((tert-butyldiphenyl silyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (1.32 g, 1.89 mmol) in propionic acid (9 mL) at −8° C. (salt/ice bath) and stirred under these conditions for 20 minutes. The reaction was diluted with ethyl acetate (20 mL, precooled to −10° C.) and quenched with slow addition of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (30 mL, precooled to −10° C.) over 15 min at 0° C. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and maintained under these conditions for 18 hours. The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 15 to 50% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (0.520 g, 38.8%) as light brown solid.
