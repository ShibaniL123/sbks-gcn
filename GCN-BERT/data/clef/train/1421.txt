(E)-methyl3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-6-bromo-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate
N-(1-(5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine 76d (1.3 g, 3.961 mmol), (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-formylphenyl)acrylate 1e (1.34 g, 5.941 mmol) and triisopropylsiyl chloride (3.8 g, 19.805 mmol) were dissolved in 6 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide and placed in a sealed tube. The reaction was heated to 120Â°C and reacted for 3 hours, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, and water was added. The reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-6-bromo-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrob enzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 76e (460 mg, yield 22%) as a yellow solid.
