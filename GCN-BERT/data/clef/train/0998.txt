184.5: 7-methylsulphanyl-3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one
0.8 mL (8 mmol) of trifluoroacetic acid is added to a solution of 1.2 g (3 mmol) of 4-(7-methylsulphanyl-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate in 7 mL of dichloromethane. The mixture is stirred for 12 hours at room temperature and then concentrated under vacuum. The crude reaction product is taken up in toluene and co-evaporated several times. 0.8 g (90%) of 7-methylsulphanyl-3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one is obtained and is used in step 184.9 without additional purification.
