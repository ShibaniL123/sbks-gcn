Step A
tert-Butyl (S)-6-oxo-6-((S)-2-((S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylcarbamoyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)hexane-1,5-diyldicarbamate
N-alpha, N-epsilon-bis(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-L-lysine dicyclohexylammonium salt (287 mg, 0.54 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (4 mL). HATU (217 mg, 0.57 mmol) and DIPEA (0.21 mL, 1.19 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred at rt for 30 minutes. Then, (2S)-2-{[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-1-ium-2-yl)ethyl]carbamoyl}pyrrolidin-1-ium dichloride (200 mg, 0.54 mmol) was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred for 18 h at rt. Water was added and the mixture was extracted 3× with EtOAc. The organic phase was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The product was purified on a SiO2 column, eluting with a gradient (0% MeOH/50% EtOAc/50% heptane→0% MeOH/100% EtOAc/0% heptane→10% MeOH/90% EtOAc/0% heptane) then on a C-18 column, eluting with a gradient of MeOH and water (0 to 100% MeOH), yielding 80 mg (24%) of the title compound
