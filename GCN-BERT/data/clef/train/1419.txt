To a solution of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (Meldrum's acid, 3.76 g, 26.1 mmol) in DCM (100 mL) at 0° C. was added difluoroacetic anhydride (3.25 mL, 26 mmol) followed by triethylamine (9.09 mL, 65.2 mmol). The cooling bath was removed and stirring continued at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction was poured into a separatory funnel, washed with 6N HCl and sat. aq. NaCl, dried over MgSO4, and filtered. The filtrate was cooled to 0° C. and acidified with acetic acid (16.4 mL, 287 mmol). To this mixture was then added sodium borohydride (2.17 g, 57.4 mmol) in three portions over 0.5 h. The reaction was allowed to stand at 4° C. overnight, then quenched with sat. aq NaCl and stirred vigorously for 0.5 h. Additional water was added to dissolve solids, and the layers were separated. The organic layer washed with sat. aq NaCl and concentrated to give 5-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (7A, 2.78 g, 51%) as a light yellow solid.
