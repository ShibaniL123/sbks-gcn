A mixture of K2CO3 (50.1 kg, 358 mol, 2.5 eq.), H2O (93 kg), 1-chloro-5-isopropoxy-2-methyl-4-nitrobenzene (33.3 kg, 145 mol), pyridin-4-ylboronic acid (23.2 kg, 189 mol, 1.3 eq.), trans-dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) (5.11 kg, 7.28 mol, 5 mol %) and 2-butanol (216 kg) was heated under an inert atmosphere at reflux for 3.5 hours. After cooling to 55° C., the mixture was filtered and the phases were separated. The organic phase was partially concentrated under vacuum, cooled to 50° C., and water (167 kg) was added. After further cooling to 5° C., the solids were filtered off. The crude product was purified by recrystallization from ethanol/water to yield 4-(5-isopropoxy-2-methyl-4-nitrophenyl)pyridine (52.9 kg, 71% yield) as a yellow solid.
