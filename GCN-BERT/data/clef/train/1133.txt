Step 4: Preparation of (S)-1-(2-phenylquinoline-3-yl)ethane-1-amine
2.42 g (7.15mmol, 1.0 equivalent) of (R)-2-methyl-N-((S)-1-(2-phenylquinoline-3-yl)ethyl)propane-2-sulfinamide prepared in step 3 was dissolved in methanol (50 mL), to which 4 M HCl dioxan solution (15 mL) was added at room temperature. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Saturated sodiumbicarbonate aqueous solution was added thereto, followed by extraction using ethyl acetate. The organic layer was separated, dried ( Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: dichloromethane/methanol, 20/1-dichloromethane/methanol, 5/1) to give 1.65 g of the target compound (S)-1-(2-phenylquinoline-3-yl)ethane-1-amine as a pale yellow solid (6.64 mmol, yield: 93%).
