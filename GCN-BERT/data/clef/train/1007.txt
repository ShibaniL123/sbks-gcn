Step 7. Preparation of 8-Chloro-3-(1-(hydroxyimino)ethyl)-2-phenylquinolin-4 (1H)-one
3-Acetyl-8-chloro-2-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one (4.5g, 0.015mol) and 50ml of anhydrous methanol were added to a 100ml three-necked flask and stirred to be dissolved. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (6.3g, 0.09mol) and sodium acetate (9.8g, 0.12mol) were then added; temperature was raised to 45Â°C and mixture was stirred for 5h. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. The reaction was stopped; solvent was removed under reduced pressure and 100ml water was added to the residue. A large amount of light yellow solid was precipitated and subjected to suction filtration and water washing. The filter cake was dried to give 4.8g of a light yellow solid with a yield of 87.1 %.
