(4) Preparation of trimethylammonium (2S,5R)-2-((2-ethyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl) carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl sulfate
(2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-N-(2-ethyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oc tane-2-carboxamide (300 mg, 0.75 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture solution of isopropanol and water (1:1, 10 mL), triethylamine (227 mg, 2.25 mmol), sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine complex (208 mg, 1.49 mmol) and Pd/C (50 mg) were added, the system was vacuumed and purged with nitrogen gas for 3 times, then purged with hydrogen gas, stirred at room temperature for 1.5h. Suck filtration was performed to remove catalyst, the filtrate was separated by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography to obtain the title compound as a white solid (50 mg, yield 15%).
