B 7-Amino-5-methyl-[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-6-ylmethanol
The reaction is carried out under an argon atmosphere. A mixture of 7-amino-5-methyl-[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-6-carboxylic acid ethyl ester A (1.00 g, 3.60 mmol) in 10 mL toluene and 5 mL tetrahydrofuran is cooled to −78° C. Sodium bis(2-methoxy ethoxy)aluminium hydride (65% in toluene; 1.13 mL, 3.78 mmol) is added. The mixture is allowed to warm up to room temperature. After stirring over night at room temperature additional sodium bis(2-methoxy ethoxy)aluminium hydride (65% in toluene, 1.13 mL, 3.78 mmol) is added. After stirring for further 1.5 hours the mixture is diluted with sodium-potassium-tartrate (saturated aqueous solution) and extracted twice with tetrahydrofuran/ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are dried and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is purified by RP-HPLC (modifier: trifluoroacetic acid).
Yield: 530 mg (81% of theory)
