Step 3. (4-(Benzyloxycarbonylamino)-2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-1-yl)methyl acetate
To a solution of 1-(acetoxymethyl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane-4-carboxylic acid (350 mg, 1.75 mmol) in toluene (5.0 mL) was added triethylamine (0.49 mL, 3.50 mmol), followed by diphenylphosphoryl azide (0.56 mL, 2.62 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, then heated to reflux for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and benzyl alcohol (0.36 mL, 3.50 mmol) was added. The resulting solution was heated to reflux overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and purified by flash chromatography (0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the desired product as a colorless oil (391 mg, 73%).
