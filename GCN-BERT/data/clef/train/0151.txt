Step 47-6, preparation of 3-[5-(4-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-6-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-1,8-naphthyridin-3-yl]-2-hydroxybenzonitrile: to a solution of tert-butyl N-(1-{6-[3-cyano-2-(methoxymethoxy)phenyl]-3-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-1,8-naphthyridin-4-yl}piperidin-4-yl)carbamate (104.8 mg, 0.17 mmol) in DCM (0.8 mL) was added TFA (0.2 mL). The mixture was stirred at RT for 1 hr. The mixture was concentrated and purified by C18 reversed-phase column chromatography to afford the title compound (55.5 mg, 0.12 mmol, 69.5% yield) as a yellow solid. MS (M+1)+=458.2.
