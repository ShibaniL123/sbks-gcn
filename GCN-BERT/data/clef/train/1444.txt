Step 1. 5-(2-Fluorophenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine
To a solution of 5-chloro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine (500 mg, 3.29 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (20 mL) and water (5 mL) were added (2-fluorophenyl)boronic acid (500 mg, 3.57 mmol), potassium phosphate (1.4 g, 6.5 mmol) and (2'-aminobiphenyl-2-yl)(chloro)(dicyclohexyl(2',4',6'-triisopropylbiphenyl-2-yl)phosphoranylidene)palladium (100 mg, 0.127 mmol). The reaction was degassed and backfilled with N2 and stirred at 90Â° C. for 15 hours. After this time it was cooled to r.t., filtered and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using 0-100% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford desired product as yellowish oil (620 mg, 98%).
