Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
(R)-3-(2-((3-((Tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (1.20 g, 2.42 mmol) and 5-bromopicolinaldehyde (0.944 g, 5.07 mmol) were heated in acetic acid (12 mL) and water (0.22 mL, 12.08 mmol) to 70Â° C. for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was evaporated and the residue was redissolved in ethanol (10 mL). Potassium acetate (0.594 g, 6.05 mmol) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.252 g, 3.63 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes then evaporated and the residue partitioned between DCM (30 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (30 mL). The organic phase was evaporated and the crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 50% EtOAc in heptane to afford (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (1.090 g, 68%) as a colourless gum.
