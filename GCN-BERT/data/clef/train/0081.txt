Synthesis of Compound A-3
A solution of N-phenyl-[1,1'-phenyl]-2-amine (1.29 g, 5.27 mmol) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (10 mL) was bubbled with nitrogen gas for 30 mins. Boron tribromide (1M in dichloromethane, 10 mL, 10.0 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 180° C. for 3 hours. After cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature (˜22° C.), it was cannulated to bis-(3-methoxyphenyl)zinc solution prepared above. The resulting reaction mixture was heated to 120° C. for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature (˜22° C.), water was added and the reaction mixture was extracted with diethyl ether (×3). Combined organic layer washed with water and brine solution in this sequence, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography with dichloromethane-hexane (1:9 to 2:8) to give Compound A-3 (0.79 g, 42% yield) as white solid.
