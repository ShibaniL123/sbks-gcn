Intermediate 16: 2-Methyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine
To a solution of 5-(trifluoromethyl)-3a,7a-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine (Intermediate 8, 100 mg, 0.53 mmol) in EtOAc (1.6 mL) was added trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate (103 mg, 0.70 mmol), and the reaction was stirred under an Na atmosphere overnight. The mixture was diluted with EtOAc and then washed with sat. aq. NaHCO3. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2Ã—), and the combined organics dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo, and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2; 0-100% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the title compound as a white solid (86.1 mg, 80% yield).
