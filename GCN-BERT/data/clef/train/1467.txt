(1.3) Intermediate 3: (R)-N-(1-benzylpyrrolidine-3-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine
After 419.5 mg of (R)-1-benzyl-N-methylpyrrolidine-3-amine was added to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask, 11.0 mL of deionized water and 372.4 mg of 6-chloro-7-deazapurine (available from Acros) were sequentially added thereto. After 609.4 mg of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) was added to the reaction mixture, the reaction mixture was refluxed for about 24 hours, and then cooled at room temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted three times with 20.0 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) to collect an organic phase. The collected organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). As a result, 506.9 mg of (R)-N-(1-benzylpyrrolidine-3-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 74.8%.
