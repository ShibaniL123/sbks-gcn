Example 6. Synthesis and Characterization of Prop-FcNCl
Synthesis of (3-chloropropyl)ferrocene (B)
Under a N2 atmosphere, 3-chloropropanoyl chloride (4.89 mL, 51 mmol) in 25 mL CH2Cl2 was added into the solution of AlCl3 (7.33 g, 55 mmol) in 50 mL CH2Cl2 dropwise and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. And then, the mixture was added into the solution of ferrocene (Fc) (9.3 g, 50 mmol) in 50 mL CH2Cl2 at 0° C. under N2 atmosphere. After stirring at room temperature for overnight, the mixture was cooled down to 0° C. again. A solution of NaBH4 (1.9 g, 50 mmol) in 10 mL diglyme was added into the reaction mixture. The reaction was continued for 4 h and 100 mL of 1 M HCl aq. solution was added to quench the reaction. The mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (100 mL×3). The organic phase was combined and dried under vacuum to get the product as a brown oil (12.5 g, 95% yield).
