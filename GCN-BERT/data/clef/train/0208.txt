5-(2,2-difluoro-1-methylcyclopropyl)-2-methoxynicotinaldehyde
(5-(2,2-Difluoro-1-methylcyclopropyl)-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methanol (Intermediate 10E, 0.164 g, 0.715 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL) was cooled to 0Â° C. and treated in portions with Dess-Martin periodinane (0.364 g, 0.858 mmol). After completion of the addition, the reaction was removed from the ice bath and was allowed to stir at room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was then diluted with 85 mL of methyl tert-butyl ether, 85 mL of saturated aqueous Na2S2O3 solution, and 85 mL of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 5 minutes. The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel, the phases were separated, and the organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting crude residue was purified by silica gel chromatography, eluting with 0 to 50% ethyl acetate-heptanes. The title compound was obtained, 0.097 g, 60% yield over three steps.
