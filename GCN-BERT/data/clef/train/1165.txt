Step 2. 5-(2-Fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-3-carboxylic acid
1M Solution of sodium hydroxide in water (5 mL, 5 mmol) was added to a solution of methyl 5-(2-fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-3-carboxylate (450 mg, 1 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) and methanol (3 mL). After stirring at r.t. for 2 h, pH was adjusted to 5 by the addition of the 1M solution of HCl. The mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate, and the separated organic phase was washed with brine. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained solid product was used in the next step without further purification (396 mg, 95%).
