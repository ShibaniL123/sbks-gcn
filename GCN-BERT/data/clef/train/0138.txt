Preparation of N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine
1-Fluoro-3-iodopropane (40 mg, 0.21 mmol) was added to a solution of N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)azetidin-3-amine (144 mg, 0.21 mmol) and DIPEA (107 μL, 0.62 mmol) in DMF (1 mL) at ambient temperature. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours and then diluted with EtOAc (40 mL) and washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (3×20 mL). The organic layers were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 15 to 30% (10% methanol in DCM containing 1% ammonium hydroxide) in DCM, to afford N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (87 mg, 56%) as yellow solid. m/z: ES+ [M+H]+ 762.
