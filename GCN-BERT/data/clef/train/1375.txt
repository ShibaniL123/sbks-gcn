Reference Example 1 Synthesis of 5-bromo-2-(methylthio)pyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid
Mucobromic acid (300 g, 1.16 mol) was added to an aqueous solution (2.5 L) of 2-methyl-2-pseudothiourea sulfate (324 g, 1.16 mol) at room temperature. The resultant suspension was cooled to 0Â°C with stir, and triethylamine (486 mL, 3.49 mol) was added dropwise thereto over four hours. The resultant reaction mixture was stirred overnight, and the completion of the reaction was confirmed by silica gel TLC. The reaction mixture was then acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 250 mL). The resultant yellow solid was collected by filtration and washed twice with water (500 mL) and then twice with diethyl ether (500 mL). The solid was dried under reduced pressure to yield the title compound (160 g, 55%).
