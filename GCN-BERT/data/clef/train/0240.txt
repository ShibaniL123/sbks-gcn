To a pear-shaped flask containing 3-6 (138 mg, 0.41 mmol, 1.0 equiv) under argon atmosphere was added N-,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL), followed by potassium carbonate (170 mg, 1.23 mmol, 3 equiv) then 2-azaspiro[5.5]undecane (0.78 mg, 0.51 mmol, 1.25 equiv) in N-,N-dimethylformamide (1 mL) and stirred at room temperature. After 18 hours, solvent was removed and remaining residue was purified by flash chromatography using a linear gradient from 1% methanol and 99% dichloromethane to 5% methanol and 95% dichloromethane, yielding intermediate 4-1 (152 mg, 0.37 mmol, 91% yield). Product was characterized by 1H, and 13C NMR in CDCl3.
