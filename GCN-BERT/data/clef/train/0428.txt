Intermediate 64: 5-Chloro-6-(difluoromethyl)-8-ethyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Step A: 3-Ethyl-5-iodopyridin-2-amine: To a solution of 3-ethylpyridin-2-amine (815 mg, 6.67 mmol) in DMF (5.4 mL) was added a solution of N-iodosuccinimide (1.95 g, 8.67 mmol) in DMF (5.4 mL), and the mixture stirred at 30° C. for 4 h. The reaction was diluted with EtOAc, and the organic layer washed with saturated aqueous Na2S2O3. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2×), and the combined organics washed with brine (4×), dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification (FCC, SiO2, 0-15% MeOH in CH2Cl2) afforded the title compound as an orange solid (1.45 g, 87% yield).
