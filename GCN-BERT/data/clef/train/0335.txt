Step 6 Synthesis of compound 39i
The compound 39h (366 mg, 0.50 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (4.00 mL). The solution was cooled to -40°C. m-chloroperbenzoic acid (138 mg, 0.550 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at -40°C for 30 minutes. An aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate was added to the reaction mixture. The solvent was evaporated, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by purified water and then brine and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent was evaporated. The obtained residue was subjected to silica gel chromatography to afford the compound 39i (257 mg, yield 69%).
