Example 2: compound (4) in table I
4-chloro-3-nitrophenol (2.5 g, 14.4 mmol, 1 eq.) was placed in dimethylformamide (48 mL) with 4-(2-chloro-ethyl)piperidine (8 g, 43.2 mmol, 3 eq.), Cs2CO3 (33 g, 100.8 mmol, 7 eq.), KI (5.3 g, 31.7 mmol, 2.2 eq.). The reaction mixture was heated at 80Â°C and stirred for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with a 1% NaOH aqueous solution, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to afford 4-(2-(4-chloro-3-nitrophenoxy)ethyl)piperidine (2.3 g, 56%).
