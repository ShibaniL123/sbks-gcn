(73-6) Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-[3-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-4-(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one (Compound 73)
A mixed solution of {1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-[3-(2,2-difluoro-2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl] -5-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl}methyl benzoate (51 mg, 0.09 mmol), lithium hydroxide monohydrate (23 mg, 0.56 mmol) in methanol (2.5 mL) and water (2.5 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. 1N hydrochloric acid was added to the reaction solution, and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane / ethyl acetate) to obtain the title compound 34 mg (yield 84%).
