[Step 5] Synthesis of compound 11414
N-((5-(hydrazinecarbonyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)-1-methyl-N-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxamide (0.200 g, 0.544 mmol) synthesized in step 4, 2,2-difluoroacetic anhydride (0.178 mL, 1.633 mmol) and triethylamine (0.152 mL, 1.089 mmol) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) at room temperature, and the solution was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2 plate, 20 x 20 x 1 mm; methanol/dichloromethane = 20 %) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.002 g, 0.9%) as a white solid.
