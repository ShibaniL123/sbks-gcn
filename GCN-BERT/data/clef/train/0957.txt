121.2: [5-bromo-3-((S)-2-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl acetate
1 ml (7.1 mmol) of triethylamine and 3.6 ml of methanol are added to a solution containing 1.2 g (3.5 mmol) of [5-bromo-3-((S)-2-chloro-1-methylethyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl acetate in 12 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 2.7 ml (151 mmol) of water. The reaction mixture is heated at 70Â° C. for 22 hours and then the solvents are concentrated under vacuum. 440 mg (39%) of [5-bromo-3-((S)-2-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl acetate is obtained in the form of a clear oil.
