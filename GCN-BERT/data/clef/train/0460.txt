Steps 2 and 3 Synthesis of compound 59e
A solution of the compound 59d in dichloromethane was obtained by the similar synthesis of the step 5 of Example 1 using the compound 59c (1.00 g, 2.25 mmol). This solution was cooled in ice. Then, the compound 59b (745 mg, 2.25 mmol) and EDC hydrochloride (948 mg, 4.95 mmol) were added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at 0Â°C for 2 hours. Then, water was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate was filtered off. Then, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to afford the compound 59e (922 mg, 64%).
