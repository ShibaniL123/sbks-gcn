Example 7-2 : Preparation of 2-bromo-3-methoxy-6-methylpyridine (XXXXV)
To 2-bromo-6-methylpyridin-3-ol (XXXXIV) were added 50 ml of acetone, potassium carbonate (K2CO3) (2.0 g, 14.66 mmol) and iodomethane (684 Âµl, 10.99 mmol), and the resulting mixture was stirred with reflux for 2 hrs. After TLC was conducted, the solvent was removed and the mixture was extracted with 60 ml of ethylacetate (EA) and 60 ml of water. The organic layer was treated with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and filtered, and the solution was concentrated and purified through silica gel chromatography (normal hexane : ethylacetate = 10 : 1, v/v) to give the title compound as pale yellow crystals (772 mg, 3.82 mmol, 42 %).
