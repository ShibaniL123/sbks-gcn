Example 47
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol) and 4-methyl-2-(pyridin-2-ylmethy)-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.105 g, 0.448 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.832 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.85 mL, 1.432 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50° C. for 5 days. The reaction mixture was quenced with water and extracted with ethyl acetate (3×20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed once with sat. NaHCO3, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography over silica gel using 95:5 dichloromethane/methanol to give 4-methyl-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-2-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.096 g, 51%) as an orangy-brown solid.
