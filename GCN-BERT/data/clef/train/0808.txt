(3)Preparation of 2-methoxy-4-methyl-6-nitrophenol
2-Methoxy-4-methylphenol (30.0 g, 0.217 mol) was dissolved in 0.8Lchloroform. After cooling to 0°C, fuming nitric acid (13.7 g, 0.217 mol) was dissolved in 70mL acetic acid, and slowly added dropwise to the solution, during which the internal temperature was controlled below 0°C. The resultant mixture was warmed to room temperature and further reacted for 0.5 h. After complete reaction, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, 150mL methanol was added to the residue. After filtration and drying in vacuum, the product (20 g, yield: 50%) was obtained.
