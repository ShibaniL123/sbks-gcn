No. A26-165: 1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-N-[1-(3-methylcyclobutyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]methanesulfonamide
Ethyl (2E)-3-(2-fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)acrylate (2000 mg, 8.36 mmol) and 3-methylcyclobutylamine hydrochloride (1017 mg, 8.36 mmol) were dissolved under argon in abs. N,N-dimethylformamide (12 mL), and then N,N-diisopropylethylamine (2.65 mL, 15.20 mmol) was added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at a temperature of 50° C. for 10 h and, after cooling to room temperature, water and ethyl acetate were added. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), ethyl (2E)-3-{2-[(3-methylcyclobutyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}acrylate (1620 mg, 64% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid, 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 8.28 (m, 1H), 8.11 (m, 1H), 7.68/7.65 (d, 1H), 6.51 (m, 1H), 6.47 (m, 1H), 4.84 (br. m, 1H, NH), 4.29 (q, 2H), 4.12/3.83 (m, 1H), 2.70 (m, 1H), 2.54/2.22 (m, 1H), 2.18 (m, 2H), 1.56 (m, 1H), 1.37 (t, 3H), 1.23/1.14 (d, 3H). Ethyl (2E)-3-{2-[(3-methylcyclobutyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}acrylate (1620 mg, 15.32 mmol) was then dissolved in abs. ethanol (15 mL), and (Ph3P)3RhCl (300 mg, 0.32 mmol) was added. After stirring at room temperature for 5 min, hydrogen was introduced into the reaction solution with a constant gas flow via a gas introduction apparatus for 9 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by LCMS. On completion of conversion, the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), it was possible to isolate ethyl 3-{2-[(3-methylcyclobutyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}propanoate (760 mg, 47% of theory) as a colorless solid. Ethyl 3-{2-[(3-methylcyclobutyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}propanoate (760 mg, 2.48 mmol) was dissolved in abs. tetrahydrofuran (8 mL) and added dropwise to a suspension, cooled down to 0° C., of sodium hydride (149 mg, 3.72 mmol, 60% suspension in oil) in abs. tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) under argon. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1 h, and then water was added cautiously, followed by ethyl acetate after stirring for 5 min. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 1-(3-methylcyclobutyl)-6-nitro-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (320 mg, 49%) was isolated as a colorless solid. In the next step, 1-(3-methylcyclobutyl)-6-nitro-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (320 mg, 1.23 mmol) was added together with tin(II) chloride dihydrate (1110 mg, 4.92 mmol) to abs. ethanol and the mixture was stirred under argon at a temperature of 80° C. for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into ice-water and then adjusted to pH 12 using aqueous NaOH. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 6-amino-1-(3-methylcyclobutyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (186 mg, 66% of theory) was isolated as a highly viscous foam. 6-Amino-1-(3-methylcyclobutyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (150 mg, 0.65 mmol) was dissolved together with (4-chlorophenyl)methanesulfonyl chloride (161 mg, 0.72 mmol) in abs. acetonitrile (5 mL) in a baked-out round-bottom flask under argon, then pyridine (0.11 mL, 1.30 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure, the remaining residue was admixed with dil. HCl and dichloromethane, and the aqueous phase was extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-[1-(3-methylcyclobutyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]methanesulfonamide (159 mg, 58% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid.
