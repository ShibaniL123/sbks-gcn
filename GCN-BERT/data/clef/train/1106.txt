Synthesis of 4-bromo-5,6-difluoro-7-[4-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-2-yl]-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole is depicted in FIG. 7: Trimethyl[4-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-2-yl]stannane (1.759 g, 3.334 mmol), 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (1 g, 3.031 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0.175 g, 0.152 mmol) were combined in a 100 mL Schlenk flask. After the system was placed under vacuum and backfilled with argon three times, 30 mL of anhydrous toluene was injected. The reaction was heated at 105Â° C. for 48 h and cooled to room temperature. The toluene solvent was removed by a rotary evaporator, and the resulting residue was purified by using a silica gel column with hexane/chloroform mixture (v/v, 95/5) as the eluent. Removal of the solvent finally produced a yellow crystal as product (0.2 g, 10.8%). The NMR spectrum is shown in FIG. 8.
