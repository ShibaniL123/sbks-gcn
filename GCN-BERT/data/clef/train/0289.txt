Preparation Example 3-4 : Preparation of 1-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)butan-1,3-dione (LXVIII)
Methyl 6-bromo-3-methoxypicolinate (3.79 g, 15.40 mmole) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Acetone (1.52 g, 26.18 mmole) and 30 % sodium methoxide (30 % NaOMe) (3.81 ml, 20.02 mmole) were added to the resulting solution and the solution was stirred at room temperature and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was diluted with distilled water, acidified with 2 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution, and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethylacetate = 1/1) to give the title compound (2.51 g, 60 %).
