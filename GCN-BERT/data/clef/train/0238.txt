Step 1: Preparation of 2-[3-[4-(2-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-8-yl)pyrazole-1 -yl]-1-cyclopropylsulfonyl-azetidine-3-yl]acetonitrile
To 8-(1H-pyrazole-4-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-amine(250 mg, 1.3 mmol) and 2-(1-cyclopropylsulfonyl-azetidine-3-ylene)acetonitrile(297 mg, 1.5 mmol), dissolved in acetonitrile(25.00 mL), was added dropwise DBU(228 mg, 1.5 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 26°C for reacting for 12 hours. After LC-MS showed that the reaction was completed, H2O (5 mL) was added and the organic layer was separated, the water layer was extracted with DCM(2×15 mL) twice. The organic phase was combined, washed with saturated salt water(15 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure to remove the filtrate. The residue was purified through silica gel column chromatography (DCM/MeOH=20/1) to give 2-[3-[4-(2-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-8-yl) pyrazole-1-yl]-1-cyclopropylsulfonyl-azetidine-3-yl]acetonitrile(250mg, 45.2% yield) as a yellow solid.
