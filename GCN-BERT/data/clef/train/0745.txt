Preparation of tert-butyl (4-chloro-2-fluoro-3-((4-fluorophenyl)carbamoyl)phenyl)carbamate (C310)
To a solution of 3-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)-6-chloro-2-fluorobenzoic acid (C318; 85.0 mg, 0.293 mmol) and 4-fluoroaniline (34.2 mg, 0.308 mmol) in ethyl acetate (2.5 mL) were added pyridine (0.094 mL, 0.880 mmol) followed by 2,4,6-tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (0.35 mL, 0.587 mmol), and the resulting light-yellow solution was warmed to 50° C. and stirred for 8 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under a stream of nitrogen, and the resulting red-orange oil was purified by automated flash chromatography (silica gel; 0→65% ethyl acetate in hexanes). The title compound was isolated as a white solid (0.075 g, 66%): mp 145-148° C.;
