Example 20
4-[({3-Methyl-2-phenyl-6-[(trifluoromethyl)sulfanyl]quinolin-4-yl}carbonyl)amino]bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid
100 mg (0.19 mmol, purity 87%) of the compound from Example 61A were dissolved in 4.0 ml of a THF/methanol mixture (5:1), 0.19 ml (0.95 mmol) of a 5 M lithium hydroxide solution was added and the mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 3 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was adjusted to pH 1-2 by addition of 4 M hydrochloric acid and purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 72 mg (85% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
