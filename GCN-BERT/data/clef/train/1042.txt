The second step The synthesis of Compound 91
To a solution of Compound 90 (344mg, 0.738mmol) in ethanol (6.88mL) were added hydroxylamine hydrochloride (61.6mg, 0.886mmol) and triethylamine (90.0mg, 0.886mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 10 minutes. THF (2.00mL) was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 40 minutes. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of ice water. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield compound 91 (243 mg, yield 66%).
