2-((S)-2-((S)-1-((S)-2-Ammonio-3-phenylpropanoyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxamido)-2-phenylethyl)pyridinium dichloride
tert-Butyl (S)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-1-((S)-2-((S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylcarbamoyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)propan-2-ylcarbamate (170 mg, 0.31 mmol) was dissolved in a 1 M HCl solution in Et2O (12.5 mL, 12.53 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 18 hours. The product was triturated in Et2O. The solid was recovered by filtration on a BÃ¼chner funnel, washed with Et2O and dried under vacuum. The solid was dissolved in water and freeze dried to afford 150 mg (93%) of the title compound
