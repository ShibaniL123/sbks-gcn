Synthesis of compound 41-c
At -78°C, 3M methyl magnesium bromide in ether (1mL, 3mmol) was added to a solution of compound 41-d (604mg, 2mmol) in anhydrous THF (20mL). The mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature and further stirred for 20mins, followed by adding saturated NH4Cl aq. solution (5mL), water (20mL) and EA (30mL) in turn. The organic phase was seperated, the aqueous phase was extracted with EA (20mL×2). The organic phases were combined, concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica column chromatography (PE:EA=8:1) to give compound 41-c (740mg, yield 82%).
