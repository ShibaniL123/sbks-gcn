Example 41: Synthesis of N-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-4-(4-(4-((1-(methylsulfonyl) azetidin-3-yl)ethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)butanamide
Step 1: Synthesis of methyl 2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-4-(4-(4-((1-(methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl)ethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)butanoate
To a solution of methyl 4-(4-(4-(azetidin-3-ylethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate dihydrochloride (Intermediate 4) (600 mg, 1 eq) in DMF (15 ml) was added with N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.83 ml, 4 eq) and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.14 ml, 1.5 eq). The mixture was stirred for 2 hr at 0Â° C., and extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (220 mg, 36%).
