Step 2: Preparation of (S)-4-((1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethyl)amino)-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
200 mg (0.361 mmol) of (S)-3-(1-((5-acetyl-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)ethyl)-8-chloro-2-phenylisoquinoline-1(2H)-one prepared in step 1 was dissolved in 3 mL of anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF), to which 0.24 mL (1.805 mmol) of N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal was added, followed by stirring at 130Â° C. for 15 hours. Ethyl acetate and water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: dichloromethane/ethyl acetate, 10/1-dichloromethane/ethyl acetate, 1/1) to give 90 mg of the target compound (S)-4-((1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethyl)amino)-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one as a white solid (0.160 mmol, yield: 44%).
