Step 7. 3-(4-aminoimidazo[1,2-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-4-methylbenzene-1-sulfonyl chloride
To a suspension of 7-(o-tolyl)imidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine (800 mg, 3.55 mmol) in DCM (10 ml) at 0° C. was added chlorosulfonic acid (8 ml, 119 mmol) dropwise until complete dissolution of the starting material (SM) was observed. The ice bath was removed and the resulting black solution was allowed to warm to room temperature. After stirring for 1 h, thionyl chloride (0.78 ml, 10.7 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to 50° C. and stirred for 0.5 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with DCM, and carefully added to a rapidly stirring mixture of DCM and ice chips. The precipitated solid was filtered and the filtrate was transferred to a separatory funnel. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The resulting solid was combined with the precipitate to yield the title compound (977 mg, 85%).
