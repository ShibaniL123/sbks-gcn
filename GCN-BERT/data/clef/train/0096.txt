(1.2) Intermediate 2: (R)-1-benzyl-N-methylpyrrolidine-3-amine
After 3.204 g of tert-butyl (R)-(1-benzylpyrrolidine-3-yl)carbamate was added to a 100-mL round-bottomed flask, 58.0 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 2.639 g of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) were sequentially added thereto. The reaction mixture was refluxed overnight and then cooled at 0°C. 2.7 mL of deionized water was slowly added to the reaction mixture while cooling. After the reaction mixture was stirred for about 5 minutes, 2.7 mL of a 15% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution was added thereto. The reaction mixture was further stirred for about 5 minutes, and then 8.1 mL of deionized water was added thereto to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite™ 545 filter agent (available from DAEJUNG Chemicals & Metals Co., Ltd.).The resulting filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2:NH4OH=5:90:5). As a result, 2.174 g of (R)-1-benzyl-N-methylpyrrolidine-3-amine was obtained with a yield of about 98.6%.
