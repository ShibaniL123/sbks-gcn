Synthesis of Compound 32
3.07 g (10 mmol) of Intermediate 1-1, 3.9 g (10 mmol) of diphenyl(3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)phosphane, 0.58 g (0.5 mmol) of Pd(PPh3)4, and 4.15 g (30.0 mmol) of K2CO3 were dissolved in 180 mL of a mixed solution of THF and H2O (a volume ratio of 2:1) and were then stirred at a temperature of 80Â° C. for 16 hours. The obtained reaction solution was cooled to room temperature. Then, organic layers were extracted three times by using 60 mL of water and 60 mL of diethyl ether. The obtained organic layers were dried by using magnesium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated. The obtained residue was dissolved in 40 mL of dichloromethane. 4 mL of hydrogen peroxide was added to the obtained solution, and the mixed solution was stirred at room temperature for 20 hours. Then, 20 mL of water was added thereto, and organic layers were extracted three times by using 20 mL of dichloromethane. The obtained organic layers were dried by using magnesium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated. The obtained residue was separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography, thereby completing the preparation of 2.52 g (50%) of Compound 32. Compound 32 was confirmed through LC-MS and 1H NMR.
