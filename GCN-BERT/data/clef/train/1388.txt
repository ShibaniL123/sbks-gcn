Example 1 Preparation of5-chloro-N4-(2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N2-(6-methyl-7-(piperidin-4-yl)benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-yl)pyrimidine-2,4-diamine (Compound 1)
(1) Preparation of 6-methyl-4-nitrobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole
5-Methyl-3-nitrobenzene-1,2-diol(10 g, 59.1 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (200 mL), and diiodomethane (31.6 g, 118 mmol)and potassium carbonate(24.4 g, 177 mmol) were added. The resultant mixture was heated to55°C and reacted for 16 h under stirring. After the reaction, the resultant mixture was cooled to room temperature, and 300 mL water was added. After extraction with ethyl acetate (200 mM×3), the organic phases were combined, washed with saturated NaCl aqueous solution, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtrated, and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate=30:1)to obtain the product (5.1 g, yield: 48%).
