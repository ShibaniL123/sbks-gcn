Synthesis of Enzyme Substrate
Synthesis of 1-(4-formyl-2-nitrophenyl)peracyl-β-galactopyranoside: 1-(4-formyl-2-nitrophenyl)peracyl-β-galactopyranoside was synthesized according to a previously published procedure. Acetobromo-α-D-galactose (1.4 g, 3.5 mmol, 1.0 eq) and silver oxide (4.1 g, 18 mmol, 5.1 eq) were dissolved in 12 mL acetonitrile. Next, 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzaldehyde (0.60 g, 3.6 mmol, 1.0 eq) was suspended in 12 mL acetonitrile and added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was stirred for 4 h at room temperature under argon atmosphere. The crude reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness in vacuo and purified via column chromatography (0% to 1% MeOH in DCM over 6 CVs, 1% isocratic for 3 CVs, 1% to 3% MeOH over 14 CVs). Solvent was evaporated from the isolated product in vacuo to yield compound 2 as a white solid (1.4 g, 2.9 mmol, 83% yield).
