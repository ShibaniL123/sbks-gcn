Step 3: Preparation of (S)-5-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one
25 mg of (S)-5-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one was prepared as a white solid by using 15 mg (0.08 mmol, 1.0 eq) of 5-chloropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one prepared in step 2 and 30 mg (0.10 mmol, 1.2 equivalent) of (S)-2-(1-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-3-phenylquinazoline-4(3H)-one according to the same manner as described in step 5 of Example 34 (0.06 mmol, yield: 68%).
