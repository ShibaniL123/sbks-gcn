Example 1: synthesis of 3-chloro-N-phenylpyridin-2-amine
2, 3-Dichloropyridine (2.96 g, 20.0 mmol), palladium (II) acetate (220.0 mg, 1.0 mmol), triphenylphosphine (520.0 mg, 2.0 mmol), sodium tert-butoxide (2.30 g, 24.0 mmol) and a stir bar were placed in a 100 mL wide mouth double-neck bottle. The deoxygenated anhydrous o-xylene (50.00 mL) and aniline (1.86 mL, 22.0 mmol) were injected by using cannula under an argon system. After the mixture were refluxed at 120‚ïê for 24 hours, the temperature was returned to room temperature. The mixture was filtered through celite, and then the solvent was removed through distillation under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography using a mixture of dichloromethane and n-hexane (1:5) as eluent and compound 1 as a light yellow oil (3.22 g, yield: 78.7%) was obtained.
