Example 60A
Methyl 4-({[3-methyl-2-phenyl-6-(trifluoromethoxy)quinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
150 mg (0.43 mmol) of the compound from Example 25A were initially charged in 1.0 ml (13.7 mmol) of thionyl chloride and stirred at RT overnight. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue, after drying under reduced pressure, was taken up in 1 ml of anhydrous THF. The suspension present was added slowly to a mixture of 0.3 ml (1.73 mmol) of DIPEA and 114 mg (0.52 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride in 2.0 ml of anhydrous THF, and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT overnight. The mixture was then adjusted to pH 2 by addition of 4 M hydrochloric acid and purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 87 mg (38% of theory, purity 97%) of the title compound
