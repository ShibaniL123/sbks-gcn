Preparation of compound 45-c.
Compound 45-d (3.1 g, 16.8 mmol) was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (30 mL) at 0°C and N-iodosuccinimide (5.7 g, 25.3 mmol) was added in batchesand the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring was continued for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was quenched by adding water (50 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (50 mL × 3). The organic phase was washed successively with water (50 mL × 3) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to deliver a white solid 45-c (4.9 g, yield: 94%). This product was used without further purification.
