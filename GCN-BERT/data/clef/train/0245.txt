1-(5-Bromo-2-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)ethanone (XXXVI) (200 mg, 1.404mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) (1.7 ml, 14.03 mmol), and the resulting solution was stirred with reflux for 24 hrs. The solution was cooled and evaporated and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a yellow solid. The solid was dissolved in methanol (MeOH) (1 mL) and 25 % sodium methoxide (NaOMe) (186 ÂµL, 6.212 mmol) and guanidin hydrochloride (498.0 mg, 6.212 mmol) were added dropwise to the resulting solution. And then, the solution was stirred with reflux for 24 hrs and cooled. The solution was diluted with ethylacetate (EA) and washed with water, and the organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the title compound (20.3 mg, 55 %).
