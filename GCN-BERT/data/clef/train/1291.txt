Step 3: Preparation of t-butyl 4-(3H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-6-yl)piperazine-1-carbonate
Analogous to the process for preparing Compound k in Step 1 in Example 4, Compound p was cyclized with trimethyl orthoformate to produce Compound q: t-butyl 4-(3H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-6-yl)piperazine-1-carbonate (0.6 g, yield 82%).
