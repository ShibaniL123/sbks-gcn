2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 3-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)propanoate
Step 1: 3-(2-methyl-1 H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid
To a stirring solution of 5-oxohexanoic acid (735 µL, 6.2 mmol) in AcOH (15 mL), was added phenylhydrazine (605 µL, 6.1 mmol), zinc chloride (1.6 g, 11.6 mmol) and then heated to 70 °C. The crude mixture was concentrated and diluted with EtOAc. The organic phase was washed four times with water, and once with brine. Finally, it was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to give the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography (40% EtOAc in PE). Yield: 870.7 mg (70%)
