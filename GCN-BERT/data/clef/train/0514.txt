Example 62: 8-Chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-(difluoromethyl)-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
Step 1: 8-Chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)-2-methyl-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
To a solution of 5,8-dichloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-methyl-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (0.250 g, 0.668 mmol) in NMP (1 ml) was added (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methanol (0.883 g, 6.68 mmol), K2CO3 (0.277 g, 2.005 mmol) and DMAP (0.008 g 0.067 mmol). The resulting solution was heated at 75Â° C. for 1 hr. The reaction mixture was taken into EtOAc/water mixture. Aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc. Combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated. The crude was purified with silica-gel chromatography (10-100% EtOAc in heptane) to give the title compound (0.277 g, 79%).
