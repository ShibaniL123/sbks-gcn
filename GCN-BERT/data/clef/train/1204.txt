Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl) methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
(R)-3-(2-(((1-Fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)amino)propyl)-2-methyl aniline (451 mg, 1.91 mmol) and 4-bromo-2-methoxybenzaldehyde (410 mg, 1.91 mmol) in a mixture of water (172 mg, 9.54 mmol) and acetic acid (7.5 mL) were heated at 80° C. for 6 hours. The reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was treated with aqueous HCl (1N; 18 mL). The mixture was stirred at 80° C. for 18 hours. The reaction was then cooled and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 was added. The mixture was extracted with DCM, and the organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 5 to 35% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (591 mg, 71.5%) as a gummy film.
