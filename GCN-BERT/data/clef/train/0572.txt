Intermediate 38: 8-Chloro-7-(difluoromethyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Step A: 8-Chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-7-carbaldehyde
To a solution of 8-chloro-7-iodo-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (Intermediate 19, 300 mg, 0.863 mmol) in THF (2.9 mL) at 0° C. was added isopropylmagnesium chloride (2.0 M in THF; 0.52 mL, 1.04 mmol) dropwise. The mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1.5 h, and then N-formylpiperidine (0.12 mL, 1.04 mmol) was added. The reaction warmed to rt and stirred for 2 h. The mixture was then transferred to a stirring solution of AcOH (1 mL) and subsequently diluted with EtOAc and H2O. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (×2), and the combined organics washed with sat. aq. NaHCO3 (×3) and brine. After drying over Na2SO4, filtering, and concentrating in vacuo, the residue was purified (FCC, SiO2, 0-100% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the title compound as a white solid (120 mg, 47% yield).
