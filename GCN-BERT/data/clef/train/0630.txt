Reference Example 4
In this reference example, a method for synthesizing tris{2-[5-(2-methylphenyl)-4-(3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl-κN2]phenyl-κC}iridium(III) (abbreviation: [Ir(mpptz-tetmb)3]), which is the organometallic complex described in Embodiment, is described. The structure of [Ir(mpptz-tetmb)3] is shown below.
Step 1: Synthesis of 4-(4-bromo-2,6-dimethylphenyl)-5-(2-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole
Into a 300 mL three-neck flask were put 8.5 g (28 mmol) of N-(2-methylphenyl)chloromethylidene-N'-phenylchloromethylidenehydrazine, 17 g (85 mmol) of 4-bromo-2,6-dimethylaniline, and 40 mL of N,N-dimethylaniline, and the mixture was heated and stirred under a nitrogen stream at 180° C. for 14 hours. After reaction for the predetermined time, the reacted solution was put into 1M hydrochloric acid and stirred for 2 days. After the reaction, extraction was performed with ethyl acetate. Then, purification was performed by silica column chromatography. As a developing solvent, a 2:1 hexane-ethyl acetate mixed solvent was used. The obtained fraction was concentrated to give a white solid. The obtained solid was recrystallized from ethyl acetate/hexane to give 5.5 g of a white solid in a yield of 46%. The obtained white solid was identified as 4-(4-bromo-2,6-dimethylphenyl)-5-(2-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The synthesis scheme of Step 1 is shown below.
