The crude imine diadduct (8b, 0.90 g) was dissolved in THF (20 mL) and treated with HCl (4.0 M solution in 1,4-dioxane, 4.1 mL, 16.4 mmol). A light-colored precipitate formed immediately on contact with the acid, hindering stirring. More THF (10 mL) was added and the mixture manually shaken and sonicated until stirring could be re-established, then continued stirring at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc (50 mL). While stirring, sat. aq NaHCO3 (30 mL) was added dropwise, causing mild gas evolution. The layers of the resulting clear, biphasic solution were separated and the aqueous layer further extracted with EtOAc (50 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to give (Â±)-4-{[(1R*,3R*)-3-hydroxycyclopentyl]amino}-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (Intermediate 8, 659.9 mg, 74% from 4-chloro-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde) as a brown oil.
