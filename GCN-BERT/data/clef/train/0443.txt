The preparation of 1-[(6-fluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-amino-piperidine-1-yl ]-xanthine
Dissolving the compound 1-[(6-fluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-t-butyloxycarbonyla mino-piperidine-1-yl]-xanthine (0.4 g, 0.7 mmol) in dichrolomethane (8 ml), dropping trifluoroacetic acid (2 ml) in at room temperature to react for 1 hour at room temperature. After adding dichloromethane (10 ml) to dilute the reaction solution, washing with a potassium carbonate aqueous solution of pH 10, extracting with dichloromethane, drying organic phase with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtering and concentrating. Separating and purifying the residue with thin layer chromatography (methylene chloride : methanol=20:1) to obtain compound 1-[(6-fluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-amino-piperidine-1-yl ]-xanthine (0.25 g, yellowish solid), with a yield of 77%. ES-API(m/z):[M+H]+450.2.
