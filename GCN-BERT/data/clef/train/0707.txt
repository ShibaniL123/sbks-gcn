Step B: 6-(2-(difluoromethyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-5-yl)benzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one. To a solution of 6-(2-(difluoromethyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-5-yl)-3-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)benzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one (38 mg, 0.074 mmol) in DCM (1.2 mL) was added TFA (0.6 mL). The mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h, and then the solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in a 2N solution of NH3 in MeOH (1 mL). After stirring for 1 h, the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was purified by reverse-phase HPLC (XBridge C18 ODB column, 5-99% ACN in 20 mM NH4OH) to yield the title compound (19 mg, 68%).
