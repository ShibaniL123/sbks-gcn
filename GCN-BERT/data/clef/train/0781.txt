Synthesis of tert-butyl (3-(2-chloro-5-nitropyrimidyl-4-amino)phenyl)carbamate
2,4-dichloro-5-nitro-pyrimidine (3.80 g, 19.59 mmol) was placed into a 100 mL round bottom flask, 80 mL of 1,4-dioxane was added, and stirred at room temperature. Tert-butyl (3-aminophenyl) carbamate (4 g, 19.21 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (2.98 g, 23.05 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The resulting solution was added dropwise into the reaction solution as said above. Upon completion of addition, the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 0.5 h, and TLC showed that the raw material was completely conversed. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and the crude product was separated through silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether / ethyl acetate = 10: 1, v/v) to obtain tert-butyl (3-(2-chloro-5-nitropyrimidyl-4-amino)phenyl)carbamate as orange solids (5.9 g, yield 84%).
