rac-(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-2-methyl-4-nitro-5-phenyl-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester
Silver acetate (CAS#563-63-3, 172 mg, 1.0 mmol, 0.15 eq) was added to a solution of (S)-2-{[1-phenyl-meth-(E)-ylidene]-amino}-propionic acid tert-butyl ester (1.6 g, 6.9 mmol, 1.0 eq) and (E)-3,3-dimethyl-1-nitrobut-1-ene (890 mg, 6.9 mmol, 1.0 eq) in acetonitrile under nitrogen atmosphere. Triethylamine (960 Î¼L, 6.9 mmol, 1.0 eq) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 18 hours at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in dichloromethane and filtered on diatomaceous earth. The filtrate was washed with water, and the combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude mixture was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (heptane/ethyl acetate 100/0 to 80/20) to provide the title compound (350 mg, 14%). LC/MS (ESI+) m/z 363.4 (M+H)+.
