Step 4
To Compound 144 (200 mg, 0.309 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) solution were added 2 mol/L potassium carbonate aqueous solution (0.309 mL, 0.619 mmol), 1-methyl-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxobororan-2-yl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (1.28 mL, 1.28 mmol) and PdCl2(dtbpf) (20.16 mg, 0.031 mmol), the mixture was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere at 100Â°C for 30 minutes. Water was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 145 (190 mg, 100% yield) as a brown oily material.
