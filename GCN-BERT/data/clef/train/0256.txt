A suspension of 5-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (7A, 2.78 g, 12.51 mmol) in benzyl alcohol (10 mL, 97 mmol) was treated with N,N-dimethylmethyleneiminium iodide (Eschenmoser's salt, 5.86 g, 31.7 mmol) and heated at 65° C. for 6 h. The mixture was poured into MTBE and washed with water (2×) and sat. aq NaCl. The organic layer was concentrated and purified by silica gel chromatography (eluting with 0-20% EtOAc in heptane) to give benzyl 4,4-difluoro-2-methylidenebutanoate (7B, 2.52 g, 89%) as a clear oil.
