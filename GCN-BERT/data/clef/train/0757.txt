3-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-2-methoxy-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)pyridine
5-Bromo-3-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-2-methoxypyridine (0.500 g, 1.505 mmol), 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-(prop-1-en-2-yl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (0.329 g, 1.956 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)), 0.174 g, 0.150 mmol) were treated with dioxane (12 mL) and a solution of potassium carbonate (0.416 g, 3.01 mmol) in water (3 mL), and the reaction mixture was heated overnight at 100Â° C. After this time, the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed three times with water and once with brine. After drying over Na2SO4, filtering, and concentrating in vacuo, the crude material was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with 0 to 10% ethyl acetate-heptanes, to provide the title compound 3-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-2-methoxy-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)pyridine (0.376 g, 85% yield).
