The compound 131A (13.8 g, 0.069 mol), cyclopropylamine (7.9 g, 0.138 mol) and triethylamine (28.8 mL, 0.21 mol) were added to NMP (160 ml). Under the protection of nitrogen, the mixture was heated to 100 Â°C and stirred for 18 hours. When reaction was complete, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature and added with water (100 ml), the reaction solution was then extracted with ethyl acetate (120 ml x 3). The organic phases were combined, washed with saturated NaCl solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to give a crude product which was then purified by column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 20:1-2:1) to give a yellow solid compound 131B (10.8 g, the yield was 71%).
