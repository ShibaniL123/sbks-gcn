Step 4
3-Ethynyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (32)
To a solution of 3-ethynyl-4-(methoxymethoxy)benzaldehyde (1.38 g, 7.263 mmol) in MeOH (15 mL) was added 2N HCl (5 mL) and stirred at 50Â° C. for 2 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, the residue was partitioned between water (20 mL) and ethyl acetate (20 mL); the organic layer was separated and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 3-ethynyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde as a colorless solid (1 g, LC/MS, 55%),
