Step 2
To Compound 142 (8.67 g, 13.44 mmol) in THF (86 mL) solution was added 1 mol/L tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF solution (40.3 mL, 40.3 mmol), the mixture was stirred under reflux at 60Â°C for 16 hours. Water was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 143 (6.28 g, 91% yield) as yellow foam.
