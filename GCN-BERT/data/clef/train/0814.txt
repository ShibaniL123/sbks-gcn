Example 7
Synthesis of 6-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (66 mg, 0.19 mmol), 6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridine-2-carboxylic acid (83 mg, 0.59 mmol), triethylamine (150 ÂµL, 1.10 mmol), and HATU (262 mg, 0.69 mmol) were reacted. To the reaction solution, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, and then the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was directly subjected to column chromatography (aminosilica gel, 10 g) using methanol and chloroform (concentration gradient, 0 to 30%) as the elution solvent, and thereby purified. The obtained syrup was dissolved in methanol, and powdered by adding tert-butyl methyl ether to the solution to obtain the title compound (83 mg, 94%) as brown solid.
