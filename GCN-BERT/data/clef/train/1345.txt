(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R/6R,8S)-7-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-2-oxo-6,7,8 ,9-tetrahydro-2H-pyrano[2,3-g]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R/6R,8S)-7-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-2-oxo-6,7,8,9 -tetrahydro-2H-pyrano[2,3-g]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)acrylate 77c (60 mg, 0.124 mmol) was dissolved in 2.4 mL of a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol (V/V=3:1). The reaction mixture was cooled to 0°C, and 0.62 mL of 1M lithium hydroxide solution was added. The reaction mixture was naturally warmed up to room temperature and was stirred for 0.5 hour. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove methanol and tetrehydrofuran. 0.5 M HCl was added to adjust the pH to 5, and the mixture was extracted by ethyl acetate (5 mL×3). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by high performance liquid chromatography to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R/6R,8S)-7-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-2-oxo-6,7,8 ,9-tetrahydro-2H-pyrano[2,3-g]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid 77 (30 mg, yield 51.5%) as a white solid.
