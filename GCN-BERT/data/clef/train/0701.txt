Example 21. Preparation of PAG-11
A 100 mL flask was charged with 1, 1-Difluoro-2-oxo-2-(1-adamntylamino)ethanesulfonyl fluoride (SM-2) (1.58 g, 5.10 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-Hydroxy-1-acetonaphthone (SM-9) (0.94 g, 5.10 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (25 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −50° C. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 3.2 mL, 5.10 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added dropwise to the mixture over 5 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 2.5 hours at −50° C. to 5° C. 1N HCl (25 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then AcOEt (75 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and the lower layer was extracted with AcOEt (50 mL) and then the organic solutions were combined. This solution was washed with 1N HCl (25 mL) and brine (25 mL). The solution was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. The solvents were removed in an evaporator and the crude product was purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt) followed by recrystallization (hexane/CHCl3, 50° C. to 0° C.) to obtain the target PAG as white solid (0.39 g) in 16.3% yield.
