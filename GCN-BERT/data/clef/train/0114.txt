Example 11: Preparation of (2S,5R)-2-((6-aminospiro[3.3]heptan-2-yl) carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate (Compound 11)
(1) Preparation of tert-butyl (6-((2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxamido)spiro[3.3]heptan-2-yl)carbamate
(2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylic acid (0.5 g, 1.8 mmol) and tert-butyl (6-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-2-yl)carbamate (0.5 g, 2.2 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), cooled under nitrogen gas protection to 0°C, 1-hydroxylbenzotriazole (0.4 g, 3.0 mmol), triethylamine (0.9 g, 8.9 mmol) and 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (0.7 g, 3.7 mmol) were added, heated to 25°C and reacted for 16h. After completion of the reaction, water (50 mL) and dichloromethane (50 mL) were added, the phases were separated to obtain an the organic phase, after concentration, the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate =2:1) to obtain the title compound (0.4 g, yield 45.9%).
