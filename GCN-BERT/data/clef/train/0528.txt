Example 37
To a solution of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol) and 2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxyaldehyde (0.063 g, 0.448 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (8 mL) with glacial acetic acid (1 mL) in a flamed dried flask. The mixture was stirred for 20 hours prior to addition of excess sodium borohydride (0.070 mg, 1.71 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred and monitored by LCMS for completion. When completed, the mixture was quenced with water and extracted with ethyl acetate (3Ã—20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed once with sat. NaHCO3, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography over silica gel using 95:5 dichloromethane/methanol to give 6-(2-(((2,4-dimethylthiazol-5-yl)methyl)amino)thiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.029 g, 19%) as a yellow solid.
