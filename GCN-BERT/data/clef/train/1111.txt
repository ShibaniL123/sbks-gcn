Synthesis Example 1
(Step 1: Synthesis of 4-(4-biphenylyl)triphenylamine)
Into a 1000-mL three-neck flask were put 28 g (85 mmol) of 4-bromotriphenylamine, 17 g (85 mmol) of 4-biphenylboronic acid, 0.92 g (3.0 mmol) of tri(ortho-tolyl)phosphine, 340 mL of toluene, 85 mL of ethanol, and 100 mL of an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate (2.0 mol/L). The mixture was degassed under reduced pressure and then, a nitrogen gas was made to flow continuously in the system. The mixture was heated to 60° C. Then, 0.22 g (1.0 mmol) of palladium(II) acetate was added and the mixture was stirred at 80° C. for 5.5 hours. After the stirring, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the precipitated solid was collected by suction filtration and washed with water, ethanol, and toluene to give 29 g of a target pale brown solid in a yield of 86%. Synthesis Scheme of Step 1 is shown in (A-1) below.
