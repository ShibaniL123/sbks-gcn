Example 56B
bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane-1-carbaldehyde
Example 56A (3.2 g, 32.6 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of dichloromethane. A separate 250-mL round bottom flask was charged with oxalyl chloride (4.57 mL, 52.2 mmol) in 55 mL of dichloromethane and the flask was cooled to −70° C. in an acetone-dry ice bath. Dimethyl sulfoxide (7.40 mL, 104 mmol) was added dropwise over 20 minutes, maintaining a temperature −60° C. After the addition was complete, the resulting solution was stirred for 15 minutes at the same temperature before addition of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-ylmethanol (3.2 g, 32.6 mmol) as a solution in dichloromethane (5 mL) over 30 minutes, maintaining a temperature −65° C. After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour (allowed to warm no further than −60° C.), at which point neat triethylamine (22.72 mL, 163 mmol) was added at −78° C. over 10 minutes. A very thick slurry resulted. The flask was removed from the ice bath. After reaching ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of 200 mL of 1 M aqueous HCl. The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed twice with 1 M aqueous HCl (30 mL) and brine then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo (rotovap bath at 10° C.) to give bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane-1-carbaldehyde (2.6 g, 27.0 mmol, 83% yield).
