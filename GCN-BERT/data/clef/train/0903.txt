Preparation of compound 2-c.
Compound 2-d (4.0 g, 15.15 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL), activated manganese dioxide (6.6 g, 75.8 mmol) was added and stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered through diatomite and the filter cake was washed with dichloromethane (50 mL Ã— 5). The combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure to deliver a yellow solid 2-c (3.8 g, yield: 96%), this product was used without further purification.
