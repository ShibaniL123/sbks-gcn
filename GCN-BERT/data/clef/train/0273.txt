Step 3: Preparation of 3-(4-(piperidine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl methanesulfonate
3-(4-(piperidine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl methanesulfonate was obtained (396 mg, yield 80%) by the same method as described in Step 4 of Example 1 using the (4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)phenyl)pyridine-1-yl)methanone (374 mg, 1.54 mmol) obtained in Step 2 and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.131 ml, 1.69 mmol).
