[1-{[5-Methyl-2,4-dioxo-3-(1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-yl)-1-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl]methyl}imidazolidin-2-ylidene]cyanamide (racemate)
590 mg (1.11 mmol, 84% purity) of the compound from Ex. 455A were dissolved in 12 ml of DMF, and 243 mg (1.67 mmol) of dimethyl N-cyanodithioiminocarbonate and 307 mg (2.22 mmol) of potassium carbonate were added. The mixture was stirred at 80Â° C. in a microwave oven (Biotage Initiator with dynamic control of irradiation power) for 4 h. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed successively with saturated sodium carbonate solution, water and saturated sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the mixture was filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 8). The product fractions were combined and concentrated. 250 mg (45% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
