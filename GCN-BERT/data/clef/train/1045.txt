Step 9: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl N-[[(2S,4S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4-hydroxy-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-yl]methyl]carbamate (4i)
The intermediate [(2S,4S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4-hydroxy-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-yl]methyl methanesulfonate (4h) (0.596 g, 1.95 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (7.8 mL) and NaN3 (0.63 g, 9.74 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was heated at 75°C overnight and then, concentrated in vacuo. The reaction mixture was quenched with water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was dissolved in a mixture of THF and toluene (5 mL/5 mL) and PMe3 (1M in THF) (2.92 mL, 2.92 mmol) was added at 0°C. After 30 min stirring at rt, the mixture was cooled to 0°C and a solution of Boc-ON (0.72 g, 2.92 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was dropwise added. The mixture was stirred at rt for 1h30 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc : 100/0 to 0/100) to give tert-butyl N-[[(2S,4S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4-hydroxy-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-yl]methyl]carbamate (4i) (324 mg, 0.99 mmol, 50%) as a colorless oil.
