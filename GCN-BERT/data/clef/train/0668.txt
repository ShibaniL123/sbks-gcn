Step 5: Synthesis of 3-(4-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)propanamide
To a solution of methyl 3-(4-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)propanoate (50 mg, 1 eq) in DMF (2 ml) was added with HATU (67 mg, 1.4 eq), HOBT (24 mg, 1.4 eq), Et3N (0.053 ml, 3 eq) and O-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (29 mg, 2 eq). The mixture was stirred for 1 hr at room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (50 mg, 80%).
