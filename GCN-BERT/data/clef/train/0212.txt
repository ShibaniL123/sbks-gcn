Synthesis of 4-(5-bromo-4-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, is depicted in FIG. 12: 5,6-difluoro-4-(4-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1.62 g, 2.626 mmol) was added to a 100 mL Schlenk flask followed by 50 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF). The solution was cooled to −78° C. before N-bromosuccinimide (0.486 g, 2.731 mmol) was added in portions in dark. The reaction was stirred overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding saturated potassium carbonate solution and then was extracted with hexane. The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removal of the solvent, the resulting mixture was subjected to column purification with hexane as the eluent. A orange wax solid (1.36 g, 66.9%) was obtained as product after recrystallization in iso-propanol and being dried in vacuo at room temperature. The NMR is depicted in FIG. 13.
