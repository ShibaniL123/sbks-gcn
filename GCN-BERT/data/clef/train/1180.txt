Step D: 7-Chloro-6-(difluoromethyl)-4-methyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-c]pyridine-3-carboxylic acid. To a solution of ethyl 7-chloro-6-(difluoromethyl)-4-methyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxylate (2.6 g, 7.29 mmol) in a mixture of 1,4-dioxane (30 mL) and water (6 mL) was added lithium hydroxide monohydrate (459 mg, 10.9 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 60° C. for 4 h. To the reaction mixture was added lithium hydroxide monohydrate (459 mg, 10.9 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 60° C. for 18 h. To the reaction mixture was added lithium hydroxide monohydrate (459 mg, 10.9 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 60° C. for 2 h. To the reaction mixture was added a fourth portion of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (459 mg, 10.9 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 60° C. for 2 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to 6 mL under vacuum. The residue was diluted with water (20 mL) and the mixture was washed with chloroform (1×10 mL). The aqueous layer was acidified to pH 4 by addition of 1 M hydrochloric acid. The precipitate was collected and the solid was washed with water (2×20 mL) to give the title compound (1.80 g, 5.48 mmol, 75%) as a white crystalline solid.
