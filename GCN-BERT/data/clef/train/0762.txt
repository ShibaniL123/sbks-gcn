Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-3,5-dimethyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
(R)-2-methyl-3-(2-((2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)amino)propyl)aniline (303 mg, 1.23 mmol) and 4-bromo-2,6-difluorobenzaldehyde (544 mg, 2.46 mmol) were heated in a mixture of acetic acid (5 mL) and water (0.111 mL) at 90° C. for 2 hours. The reaction was allowed to slowly cool to ambient temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction was then concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was dissolved in EtOAc (30 mL) and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2×20 mL). The combined aqueous layers were extracted with EtOAc (2×20 mL), and the combined organic layers were washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride and concentrated to minimal volume (˜20 mL). Aqueous HCl (1N; 20 mL) was added, and the biphasic mixture was stirred vigorously for 2 hours. The layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (20 mL). The aqueous layer was basified by the addition of solid sodium carbonate (until pH ˜8 as measured using a pH strip) and then extracted with DCM (3×20 mL). The combined DCM extracts were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 40 mg of crude product. Meanwhile, the combined EtOAc extracts were washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride and concentrated to dryness. The resultant residue was dissolved in THF (10 mL) and stirred with polystyrene-bound tosylhydrazide (1.03 g, 2.76 mmol) for 14 hours. The mixture was filtered, and the resin was washed successively with THF (10 mL) and MeOH (3×10 mL). The filtrate was combined with the previously obtained ca. 40 mg of crude product and concentrated under reduced pressure. This final residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 30% EtOAc in hexanes. Product fractions were concentrated to dryness to afford (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-3,5-dimethyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (230 mg, 41%) as a pale yellow solid.
