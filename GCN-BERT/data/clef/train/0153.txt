Preparation of (R)-3-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methylaniline
A mixture of crude (R)-1-(3-(2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-amine dihydrochloride, aqueous hydroxylamine (50 wt %; 107 mL, 1.74 mol), and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (97 g, 1.39 mol) in ethanol (400 mL) was warmed to reflux conditions. After 18 hours, the reaction was cooled to 0° C., basified with aqueous sodium hydroxide (50 wt %; 153 g, 1.92 mol) and extracted with DCM. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by SFC (Princeton Chromatography DEAP column, 100 mm length, 30 mm diameter, 5 μm, 40° C. column temperature, 100 bar column pressure, 100 mg/mL flow rate), eluting with 25% methanol containing 0.2% NH4OH in CO2, to afford (R)-3-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methylaniline (24 g, 84%) as a light amber solid.
