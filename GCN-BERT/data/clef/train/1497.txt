Step D: Ethyl 7-chloro-6-(difluoromethyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5 -a]pyridine-3-carboxylate. To a solution of 2-chloro-3-(difluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium-1-amine;2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (1.22 g, 3.22 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (15 mL) was added ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoro-2-butynoate (460 μL, 3.22 mmol) and triethylamine (449 μL, 3.22 mmol) at 0° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h. To the reaction mixture was added 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (730 mg, 3.22 mmol) at 0° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was poured into water (20 mL). The precipitate was collected and washed with water (2×10 mL). Purification (FCC, SiO2, eluting with n-hexane:dichloromethane (2:1)) afforded the title compound (360 mg, 1.05 mmol, 32%) as a white crystalline solid.
