Step 2. 3-(Difluoromethoxy)-5-fluoroaniline
A mixture of 1-(difluoromethoxy)-3-fluoro-5-nitrobenzene (1.3 g, 6.28 mmol), iron (2.454 g, 43.9 mmol) and ammonium chloride (2.02 g, 37.7 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (5 ml), water (7 ml) and methanol (5 ml) was refluxed for 3 h. After cooling to r.t., the solids were filtered off and the solvents were evaporated in vacuo. The crude product concentrate was purified by Biotage Isoleraâ„¢ (1.27 g, 99%).
