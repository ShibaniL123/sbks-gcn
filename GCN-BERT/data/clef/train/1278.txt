Step C: 7-(7-Chloro-1H-indazol-5-yl)-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5 -a]pyridine. To a solution of 7-(7-chloro-1H-indazol-5-yl)-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5 -a]pyridine-3-carboxylic acid (54 mg, 0.12 mmol) and AcOH (1 μL, 0.0175 mmol) in DMSO (2 mL) was added silver carbonate (10 mg, 0.0363 mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred at 120° C. for 1.5 h. After cooling to rt, the mixture was diluted with EtOAc (50 mL) and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with brine (5×15 mL). The combined aqueous layers were extracted with EtOAc (2×15 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2; 0-1% MeOH/CHCl3). The crude product was taken up in EtOH and evaporated (3×5 mL). The residue was triturated with Et2O (2 mL) to give the title compound (25 mg, 51%) as a white solid.
