5. Synthesis of 3, 7-dihydroxy-6-ethyl-7-d-5-cholan-24-oic acid (compound 1)
To a flask was added methyl 3,7-dihyroxy-6-ethyl-7-d-5-cholan-24-oate (1.2 g, 2.8 mmol), sodium hydroxide solution in water (10%, 2.24 g, 5.6 mmol), and THF/MeOH/water mixture solution (1/3/2, 20 ml). The mixture was stirred at 40Â°C for 6 h. 3N HCl was added to adjust pH to 2-3. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic fraction was washed subsequently with water and brine, dried with Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated and the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (5% methanol/dichloromethane) to afford the target compound (0.87 g, 75%).
