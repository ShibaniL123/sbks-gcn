One Pot Preparation of Pimavanserin (Without Isolation of Compound 1)
Step 1: Preparation of 2-(4-isobutoxyphenyl)acetic acid
To a 250 mL, 3 neck, round bottom flask, equipped with thermocouple and nitrogen sweep, was charged 10 g of 4-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid (Molecular weight (FW): 152.15, 65.7 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 30 g of potassium carbonate (FW: 138.21, 216.8 mmol, 3.3 equiv.), 1.1 g of potassium iodide (KI, FW: 166, 6.57 mmol, 0.1 equiv.), followed by 100 mL (10 vol.) of DMF. After stirring for 5 minutes at room temperature, 15.7 mL of isobutyl bromide (FW: 137.02, 144.6 mmol, 2.2 equiv.) was charged into the batch. The mixture was then heated to 75° C. and kept stirring at the same temperature for 2 days until no limited starting material remaining as determined by HPLC. The reaction was cooled down to room temperature, and quenched by charging with 100 mL of deionized (DI) water. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to less than 1 by charging 100 mL of 2N HCl. The product was extracted with 150 mL of ethyl acetate. After partitioning, the upper organic layer was washed with additional 100 mL of DI water, concentrated to dryness on the rotary evaporator under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 100 mL each of THF (10 vol) and DI water (10 vol). After charging 20 g of lithium hydroxide, the mixture was heated to reflux for 3 hours until complete reaction. The batch was cooled to room temperature, concentrated on rotary evaporator to remove THF. The residue was acidified with 300 mL of 2N HCl and 45 mL of 6N HCl aqueous solution until pH1. The product was extracted with 2×250 mL of methylene chloride, dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered on Buchner funnel. The filtrate was concentrated to dryness on rotary evaporator under vacuum to afford 10.18 g of 2-(4-isobutoxyphenyl)acetic acid, representing a 74.4% yield in 98.5 A % purity.
