Intermediate 3. (3-Bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)methanol
To a mixture of 3-bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid (0.97 g, 3.61 mmol) and triethylamine (0.528 mL, 3.79 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) was added isobutyl carbonochloridate (0.491 mL, 3.79 mmol). After stirring for 30 min at r.t., the solids were filtered-off, and a solution of sodium tetrahydroborate (0.273 g, 7.21 mmol) in water (1.300 mL) was slowly added to the filtrate. After stirring at r.t. for 30 min, the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, and the resulting mixture was washed with brine. The separated organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated in vacuo and the obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isoleraâ„¢ (550 mg, 64%).
