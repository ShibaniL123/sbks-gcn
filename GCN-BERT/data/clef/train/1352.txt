To a solution of 6-allyloxy-3-(triazol-1-yl)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (12a) (150 mg, 0.607 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (6.1 mL) were added glacial AcOH (69 µL, 1.21 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (351 mg, 0.303 mmol). After 45 min of stirring at rt, pyridine (6.1 mL) and sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (483 mg, 3.03 mmol) were added to the reaction mixture. The resulting suspension was protected from light and stirred overnight until the reaction was completed. The reaction mixture was concentrated, then diluted with DCM and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum and then purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (DCM/acetone: 100/0 to 0/100) to afford triphenyl-(propenyl)-phosphonium 7-oxo-3-(triazol-1-yl)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-6-yl] sulfate (215.7 mg) as a pale yellow foam. This foam was dissolved in a minimum of a mixture H2O/ACN 20/80 and applied on a Dowex sodium form column (Dowex® 50WX8 hydrogen form stored with an aqueous solution of 2N NaOH and washed until neutral pH with H2O). The fractions containing the desired compound were combined and concentrated (bath temperature < 30°C). The compound was diluted in H2O, filtered on Millipore 0.22 µM, frozen and lyophilized to afford sodium [7-oxo-3-(triazol-1-yl)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-6-yl] sulfate (Example 12) (96 mg, 0.310 mmol, 51% over 3 steps, purity 95%) as a beige amorphous solid.
