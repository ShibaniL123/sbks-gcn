(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-{[(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]amino}-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-(2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid
Example 17A
(2S,3R,4S,5S)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-(2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-2-carboxylate
To cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride (0.228 mL, 1.707 mmol) and one drop of N,N-dimethylformamide in dichloromethane (4 mL) was added oxalyl chloride (4 mL, 2 M in dioxane) dropwise at ambient temperature. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, the solvent was removed, fresh dichloromethane (2 mL) was added, and the mixture was concentrated again. The residue in dichloromethane (2 mL) was added dropwise to the mixture of (2S,3R,4S,5S)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Core 12, 500 mg, 1.423 mmol) and triethylamine (0.297 mL, 2.134 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) in an ice bath, keeping the temperature below 0Â° C. during the addition. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 hours, and dichloromethane (20 mL) and water (10 mL) were added. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified via chromatography on a 24 g silica gel cartridge, eluting with ethyl acetate in heptane at 0-40% gradient to yield the title compound 650 mg (99% yield).
