Step 3:
Compound 9-iv (300mg, 0.66 mmol) was dissolved in 12 mL of ethanol, and added with 12mL of sodium sulfite aqueous solution (20%). The reaction solution was heated to reflux 24 hours. After TLC (PE: EA = 10: 1) showed completion of the reaction, 20 mL of water was added, and the solution was acidity. The reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain compound 9-v (200 mg, 76%).
