Example 75A
Methyl 4-({[3-methyl-2-phenyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)quinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo [2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
10 mg (0.03 mmol; purity 94%) of the compound from Example 41A were initially charged in 0.1 ml of DMF. Successively, 8 mg (0.036 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, 17 mg (0.045 mmol) of HATU and 0.021 ml (0.12 mmol) of DIPEA were added to the solution, and the mixture was subsequently stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, ethyl acetate and water were added to the mixture. The phases were separated, and the organic phase was washed with saturated sodium carbonate solution and dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, mobile phase cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 2:1). This gave 14 mg (94% of theory, purity 100%) of the title compound
