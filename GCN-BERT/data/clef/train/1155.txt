Example 51-4 : Preparation of 6-(2-amino-6-morpholinopyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-5-methoxy-[2,4'-bipyridin]-2'-amine (LXXV)
4-(6-Bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-6-morpholinopyrimidin-2-amine (157.91 mg, 431.21 µmol) and 2-[3-fluoro-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolan-2-yl)-2-pyridinyl]-imidodicarbonic acid-1,3-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)ester (378 mg, 862.42 µmol) obtained in Preparation Example 1 were dissolved in dioxane (4 mL). To the resulting solution were added dropwise potassium phosphate (K3PO4) (274.6 mg, 1.29 mmol) dissolved in distilled water (2 mL) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) (24.94 mg, 21.56 µmol). The solution was refluxed with heat for 24 hrs, cooled and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The solution was diluted with dichloromethane and washed with water. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethylacetate/hexane, 6/1) to give the title compound (47 mg, 27 %).
