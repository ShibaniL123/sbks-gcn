Example 7
Acetal 1e:
A 2-dram vial with a PTFE-lined cap was charged with [1,1'-biphenyl]-3-ylmethanol (8e, 54.9 mg, 0.298 mmol) and benzoate S1 (115 mg, 0.395 mmol). These were dissolved in DCE (1.00 mL), and TFA (2.2 μL, 0.0297 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was heated to 80° C. and stirred for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, K2CO3 (83.3 mg, 0.604 mmol) and MeOH (1.00 mL) were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 23° C. for 24 h. The mixture was then filtered through a short pad of silica gel, eluting with EtOAc (30 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (4:1 hexanes/EtOAc eluent) to afford acetal 1e, still containing some residual benzoate S1. The impure material was dissolved in MeOH (2.00 mL) and CH2Cl2 (2.00 mL), K2CO3 (82.8 mg, 0.600 mmol) was then added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 23° C. for another 23 h. The mixture was then filtered through a short pad of silica gel, eluting with EtOAc (30 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (2:1 hexanes/EtOAc eluent) to afford acetal 1e (93.9 mg, 89% yield, Rf=0.29 in 3:1 hexanes/EtOAc) as a colorless oil.
