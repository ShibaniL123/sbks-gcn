Example 12. Preparation of N-(3-(4-(4-cyanopiperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentanamide (LMT-829)
The N-phenyl-N-(3-(4-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide (50 mg, 0.124 mmol) obtained in Example 2 and trimethylsilyl cyanide (49 µl, 0.372 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (2 ml), and stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes. Sodium hypochloride (43 µl, 0.620 mmol) was added to the mixture, heated at 80 °C, refluxed, and stirred for 12 hours. The reaction solution was cooled at room temperature, filtered to remove a solid, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was diluted with ethyl acetate, and washed with water and brine. An organic solvent layer was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2:MeOH=200:1), thereby obtaining a final product, N-(3-(4-(4-cyanopiperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentanamide (11 mg, 21% yield).
