Reference Example 1-2
Synthesis of (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-10-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole
To a 200-mL round bottom flask, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6, 11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (694 mg, 1.98 mmol) synthesized according to the method of Reference Example 1-1 was added, and dissolved in DMF (20 mL), imidazole (241 mg, 3.54 mmol) and tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane (498 mg, 3.31 mmol) were added to the solution at room temperature, and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Since it was confirmed that the starting material remained in the reaction solution, imidazole (529 mg, 7.77 mmol) and tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane (503 mg, 3.34 mmol) were added to the reaction solution, and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. To the reaction solution, water (150 mL) was added, and the resulting mixture was extracted with a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate and hexane (1:1, 100 mL). 6% Aqueous ammonia (30 mL) was added to the aqueous layer to make it basic, and then the resulting mixture was extracted twice with a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate and hexane (1:1, 100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, then the insoluble matter was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 25 g) using methanol/chloroform (concentration gradient, 0 to 50%) and then methanol containing 10% concentrated aqueous ammonia/chloroform (concentration gradient, 20 to 50%) as the elution solvent to obtain the title compound (456 mg, 50%) as yellow syrup, and obtain the starting material, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (265 mg, 38%).
