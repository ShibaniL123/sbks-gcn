Example 6. Isobutyl (R)-3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate
70.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask, and then dissolved with 1.00 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 0.0420 mL of isobutyl chloroformate was added thereto, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0560 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and then stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and then purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 41.0 mg of isobutyl (R)-3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate was obtained with a yield of about 40.2%.
