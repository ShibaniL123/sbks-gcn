Step 3: (R)-tert-Butyl (2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethyl)(piperidin-4-ylmethyl)carbamate
A stirred solution of (R)-tert-butyl (2-(8-(benzyloxy)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)carbamate (2.80 g, 4.33 mmol) in ethanol (30 mL) was added with 10% Pd/C (2.8 g) and 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene (4.86 mL, 43.3 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux [Care-vigorous evolution of gas] and heated under reflux for 1 hour. The suspension was filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the title compound (2.26 g, 98%).
