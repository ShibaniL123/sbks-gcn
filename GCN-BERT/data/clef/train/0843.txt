Example 2
6-((6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-N-(1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)pyridin-3-amine
[(2-Di-cyclohexylphosphino-3,6-dimethoxy-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)-2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) methanesulfonate (BrettPhos Pd G3) (6.83 mg, 8.00 mol) and sodium tert-butoxide (48.0 mg, 0.50 mmol) were added to a degassed solution of (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-7-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (107 mg, 0.20 mmol) and 1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (52.9 mg, 0.40 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (1.6 mL) and the reaction was heated to 90Â° C. for 5 hours. After cooling, the reaction was diluted with DCM and washed with water. The organic phase was evaporated, then dissolved in DCM (2 mL), before TFA (1 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, then was diluted with DCM and washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution. The layers were separated and the aqueous was extracted with DCM. The combined organics were dried and evaporated, then the crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 20% MeOH in EtOAc. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 6-((6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-N-(1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)pyridin-3-amine (83 mg, 83%) as a beige solid.
