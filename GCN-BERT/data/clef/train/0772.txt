Step 3
1-(3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)propyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
Sodium hydride (28.0 mg, 0.690 mmol) was added to a solution of imidazole (46.9 mg, 0.690 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 mL) at 0°C. The reaction solution was stirred at 20°C for 1 hour. A solution of 1-(3-iodopropyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (200 mg, 0.570 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 mL) was added dropwise to the reaction solution at 0°C. The reaction solution was slowly warmed to 20°C, stirred for 12 hours and then cooled to 0°C. The reaction solution was quenched by addition of saturated ammonium chloride solution (10 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (10 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined and washed with brine (10 mL x 3), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. And the residue was purified by preparative HPLC to give 1-(3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) propyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (50.0 mg) with a yield of 30%.
