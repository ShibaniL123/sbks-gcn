[Step 4] Synthesis of tert-butyl 3-((4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl) (3-fluorophenyl)carbamoyl)azetidine-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 3-((4-(2-(2,2-difluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)-2-fluorobenzyl) (3-fluorophenyl) carbamoyl)azetidine-1-carboxylate (0.600 g, 1.114 mmol), synthesized in step 3, and 1-methoxy-N-triethylammoniosulfonyl-methanimidate (Burgess reagent, 0.398 g, 1.671 mmol) were mixed in tetrahydrofuran (15 mL) at room temperature. The mixture was heated by microwave irradiation at 150Â°C for 30 minutes, and then cooled to room temperature to terminate the reaction. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 40 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 5% to 30%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.500 g, 86.2%) as a white solid.
