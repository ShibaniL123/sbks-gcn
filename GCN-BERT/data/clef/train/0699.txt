Step 5. 1-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl(methyl)amino)-4-fluoro-6-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-5-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate
To a solution of tert-butyl (4-fluoro-5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl)(methyl)carbamate (234.1 mg, 0.793 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5.0 ml) at 0Â° C. was added pyridine (1001.7 mg, 12.66 mmol). A solution of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (671.2 mg, 2.379 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5.0 mL) was added slowly. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 6 h. The reaction mixture was quenched with 2 M K2CO3 (aq) and extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (40 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product (284.9 mg, 84%).
