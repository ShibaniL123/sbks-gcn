(11)Preparation of 5-chloro-N4-(2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N2-(7-methyl-8-(piperidin-4-yl)-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)pyrimidine-2,4-diamine
Tert-butyl4-(8-((5-chloro-4-((2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)amino)pyrimid in-2-yl)amino)-6-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)piperidin-1-car boxylate (90 mg, 0.137 mmol)was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL), and trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was added. After stirring at room temperature for 12 h, TLC detection showed that the raw materials disappeared. Water (10 mL) was added, and phases were separated. The water phase was extracted with dichloromethane (10 mLÃ—2). The organic phases were combined, and dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (methanol: dichloromethane=1:50) to obtain the final product (50 mg, yield: 65.5%).
