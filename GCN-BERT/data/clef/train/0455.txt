(E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-(6-(1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylp ropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-(6-(1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluoropheny l)acrylate 13b (50 mg, 0.093 mmol) was dissolved in 3.5 mL of a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol (V/V=6:1), then 0.5 mL of 1 M lithium hydroxide solution was added. After stirring for 3 hours, the reaction was stopped. 10% of citric acid was added dropwise to adjust the pH to 3-4, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate three times. The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-(6-(1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylp ropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid 13 (18 mg, yield 37%) as a yellow solid.
