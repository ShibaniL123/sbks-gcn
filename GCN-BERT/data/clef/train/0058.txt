Step 2: Benzyl 4-((2-oxo-2-phenylacetoxy)methyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate
A solution of phenylglyoxylic acid (8.64 g, 56.3 mmol) in DMF (100 mL) was added with potassium hydrogen carbonate (11.52 g, 112.6 mmol) and stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes. Benzyl 4-((tosyloxy)methyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (25.5 g, 62.0 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture heated at 60Â° C. for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled and diluted with ethyl acetate. The mixture was washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and brine. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% iso-hexane to 1:4 ethyl acetate/iso-hexane) to afford the title compound (13.2 g, 61%).
