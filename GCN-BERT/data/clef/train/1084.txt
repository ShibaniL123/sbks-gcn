Step 2 Synthesis of Compound I-208
To Compound 134 (21 mg, 0.041 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (0.3 mL) and methanol (0.3 mL) solution was added 4 mol/L aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide (0.3 mL, 1.2 mmol), the mixture was stirred at 80Â°C for 3 hours. 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added thereto, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by liquid chromatography to obtain Compound I-208 (13 mg, 64% yield) as a yellow solid.
