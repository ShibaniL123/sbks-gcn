1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-{N-[(R)-α-(t-butoxycarbonyl)benzyl] carbamoylmethoxy}-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-S-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-carboxymethoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Method 3; 627 mg, 1.24 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (25 ml), tert-butyl (2R)-amino(phenyl)acetate (308 mg, 1.48 mmol), 2,6-dimethylpyridine (288 µl, 2.47 mmol) and TBTU (477 mg, 1.48 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred for 3.5 hours. The reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure. The product was purified using an Isolute column (10g, silica). The product was eluted with a stepwise gradient using DCM:EtOAc 100:0 then 95:5. Approximately 694mg pure compound was collected. Another fraction was purified a second time using an Isolute column (10g, silica). The product was eluted with a stepwise gradient using DCM:EtOAc 100:0,95:5 then 90:10. The pure fraction was added to the first fraction yielding 787 mg (91%) of the title compound NMR (400MHz, CDCl3) 0.78 (t, 6H), 0.92-1.12 (m, 4H), 1.12-1.46 (m, 6H), 1.54 (s, 9H), 1.58-1.72 (m, 2H), 2.14 (s, 3H), 3.8-4.05 (m, 2H), 4.32 (brs, NH), 4.56 (ABq, 2H), 5.56 (d, 1H), 6.56 (s, 1H), 7.04 (t, 1H), 7.10 (brd, 2H) 7.24-7.42 (m, 8H), 7.84 (d, NH); m/z 694.7 (M-H)-.
