Example 35-2 : Preparation of 1-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-3-(1-ethylpiperidin-4-yl)propan-1,3-dione
Methyl 6-bromo-3-methoxypicolinate (4.79 g, 15.40 mmole) obtained in Preparation Example 3-3 was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF). To the resulting solution were added 1-(1-ethylpiperidin-4-yl)ethanone (5.52 g, 15.42 mmole) obtained in Example 35-1 and 30 % sodium methoxide (30 % NaOMe) (4.81 ml, 20.02 mmole) and the solution was stirred at room temperature. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was diluted with distilled water, acidified with 2 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethylacetate = 1/1) to give the title compound (3.41 g, 61 %).
