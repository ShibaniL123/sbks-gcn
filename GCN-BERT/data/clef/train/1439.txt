Synthesis of (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(1-(2-methoxyethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one Hydrochloride
A solution of hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether (2.0 N, 0.670 mL, 1.34 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(1-(2-methoxyethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one (0.165 g, 0.536 mmol) in diethyl ether (10.7 mL) at 0Â° C. The reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour and then stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The white solid precipitated was filtered and collected, washed with diethyl ether and dried at room temperature to obtain (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(1-(2-methoxyethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one hydrochloride (0.177 g, 0.463 mmol, 86%)(hereinafter referred to as the compound of Example 21) as a white solid.
