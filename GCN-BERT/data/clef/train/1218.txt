Step 2: tert-butyl 2-(3-chloropropylsulfonyl)-3-iodo-4,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole-5(2H) -carboxylate
Tert-butyl 3-iodo-4,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole-5(2H)-carboxylate (2.80 g, 8.36 mmol) and triethylamine (1.69 g, 16.7 mmol) were dissolved in 80 mL tetrahydrofuran, and cooled to -10 Â°C. Thereto was added 3-chloropropylsulfonyl chloride (1.77 g, 10 mmol), and stirred at low temperature overnight. Water (100 mL) was added, and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was washed sequentially with citric acid solution, water, and brine, dried and concentrated by evaporation, and then the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to give tert-butyl 2-(3-chloropropylsulfonyl)-3-iodo-4,6-dihydropyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrazole-5(2H)-carboxylate (2.70 g). Yield: 68%.
