Step 4: Preparation of tert-butyl 4-(4-(3-(methylsulfonyloxy)prop-1-ynyl)benzoyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate
The tert-butyl 4-(4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)benzoyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (600 mg, 1.74 mmol) obtained in Step 3 was dissolved in dichloromethane (8 ml), and cooled on ice. Triethylamine (0.36 ml, 2.61 mmol) was added to the mixture, and stirred for 5 minutes. Methanesulfonyl chloride (0.15 ml, 1.92 mmol) was added at the same temperature, the ice was removed, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue obtained thereby was diluted with dichloromethane and washed with water and brine. An organic solvent layer was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Hex:EA=2:1), thereby obtaining tert-butyl 4-(4-(3-(methylsulfonyloxy)prop-1-ynyl)benzoyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (662 mg, 90% yield).
