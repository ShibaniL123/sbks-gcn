Preparation of compound 38-g.
Compound 38-h (3 g, 6.56 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (30 mL) and the reaction solution was cooled to -78°C. Then n-butyllithium (7.5 mL, 18.75 mmol,2.5 M solution in n-hexane), was added dropwise to the above solution, and the stirring was continued for 30 minutes after the addition.A solution of S-propylene oxide (580 mg, 9.84 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (2 mL) was added dropwise to the above reaction solution. After the addition, boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (1.4 g, 9.84 mmol) was added. The resulting yellow solution was slowly warmed to room temperature and stirring was continued for 16 hours and then diluted with saturated aqueousammonium chloridesolution (50 mL). The mixed solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL × 3). The combined organic phases were washed successively with water (50 mL × 3) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 5: 1) to delivera pale yellow oil 38-g (2.1 g, yield: 66%).
