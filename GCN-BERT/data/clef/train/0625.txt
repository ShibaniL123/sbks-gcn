(13)Preparation of 5-chloro-N4-(2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N2-(7-methyl-8-(pyrrolidin-3-yl)-2, 3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)pyrimidine-2,4-diamine
Tert-butyl 3-(8-((5-chloro-4-((2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)amino)pyrimidin-2-yl)amino) -6-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)pyrrolidin-1-carboxylate (50 mg, 0.08 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL), and 5 mL trifluoroacetic acid was added. The resultant mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1h. After the reaction, the resultant mixture was washed with sodium bicarbonatesolution, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtrated, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. After silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane: methanol=10:1), the final product (16 mg, yield: 38%) was obtained.
