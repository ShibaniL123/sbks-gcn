Step 2
3-(1H-indole-3)propan-1-ol
Methyl 3-(1H-indole-3-)-propionate (180 mg, 0.890 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (10 mL), and lithium aluminum hydride (67.0 mg, 1.70 mmol) was added at 0Â°C to react for 1 hour. Water (10 mL) was added to quench the reaction. The reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (10 mL x 3), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by preparative TLC plate (1:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.5) to give 3-(1H-indole-3)propan-1-ol (100 mg, as a green solid) with a yield of 65%. MS-ESI [M + H]+ calcd. 176, found 176.
