The drive wheel is in mechanical connection with a motor that is seated atop of the drive wheel system. The Anderson Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,347,908) discloses an apparatus in which a self-propelled vehicle is caused to traverse a terrain by following a line arranged over the terrain in a predetermined manner. However, the self-propelled vehicle does not utilize a sickle mower that is self-propelled and otherwise open to span across a predetermined path. The Jonas et al. Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,813) discloses a system for automatic performance of agricultural tasks such as lawn mowing, which includes a ground inserted rail type system. However, the lawn mowing function does not rely on a sickle mower that is guided along a rail. The Bergvall et al. Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 6,300,737) discloses an electronic bordering system, which may be used with a robot lawn mower. However, the robot lawn mower is not a sickle mower that is driven along a rail. The Pansire Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,180,964) discloses a fully automatic self-propelled self-guiding lawn mower in which guidance of the lawn mower is based on the principal of a magnet following a passive ribbon or wire of ferromagnetic material. However, the lawn mower relies on magnets or passive ribbon, and not a rail system to guide a sickle lawn mower along. The Nelson Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 5,974,347) discloses a method for controlling the operation of an automated vehicle in accordance with stored coordinate information compared with calculated coordinate position determined from the solution of simultaneous circle equations. Again, the method relies on wireless communication in order to navigate a lawn mower.

Detailed reference will now be made to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in FIGS. 1-4. An automated grass cutter 100 (hereinafter invention) includes a rail 101 further defined with a top surface 102, bottom surface 103, inner surface 104, and outer surface 105. The rail 101 has a generally squared-shape when looking at FIG. 2. The rail 101 is of an undefined length, and may have turns or be linear. Moreover, the rail 101 is the path of use of the invention 100, and enables a drive wheel system 110 to connect thereon. The rail 101 is held in place via fence posts 120. The fence posts 120 are inserted into a ground surface 200, and include a rail arm 121 that is perpendicularly-oriented with respect to the fence post 120. Moreover, the fence post 120 and the rail arm 121 support the rail 101 at an elevation 201 above the ground surface 200. Fence rails 125 may span between two consecutive fence posts 120. The drive wheel system 110 includes a series of inner guide wheels 111 as well as a series of outer guide wheels 112. The inner guide wheels 111 engage the inner surface 104 of the rail 101 whereas the outer guide wheels 112 engage against the outer surface 105 of the rail 101. The outer guide wheels 112 include an outer bracket 117 that linearly connect to all of the outer guide wheels 112. The inner guide wheels 111 include an inner bracket 118 that connects across all of the inner guide wheels 111. The drive wheel system includes a drive wheel 113 that is engaged against two adjacent outer guide wheels 112. The drive wheel 113 is responsible for propelling the drive wheel system 110 along the rail 101. The drive wheel 113 is in mechanical connection with a drive motor 130 via a drive wheel belt 131. The drive motor 130 is mounted atop of a motor plate 177. A plurality of spring members 114 traverse between the inner guide wheels 111 and the outer guide wheels 112 to insure adequate contact of the drive wheel system 110 to the rail 101. The spring members 114 ensure that the inner guide wheels 111 and the outer guide wheels 112 are able to maintain traction to the rail 101 regardless of whether the rail 101 has a curve or is linear. The spring members 114 span across and above the rail 101 so as to not interfere with the rail arms 121 that are periodically spaced along the length of the rail 101. The drive wheel belt 131 extends from a drive motor shaft 132 to a drive wheel shaft 133. The drive motor shaft 132 extends down from the drive motor 130 to a sickle blade gear 134, which is positioned underneath the drive wheel system 110. The sickle blade gear 134 attaches to a sickle idler arm 135. The sickle idler arm 135 is responsible for translating rotational motion of the sickle blade gear 134 to a back and forth motion. The sickle idler arm 135 connects to a sickle mower blade 140 such that the sickle idler arm 135 moves the sickle mower blade 140 back and forth whilst a stationary mower blade 141 remains motionless. The sickle mower blade 140 and the stationary mower blade 141 collectively form the grass cutting feature of the invention 100. The sickle mower blade 140 and the stationary mower blade 141 are supported via a mower blade brace 145. A guard 146 is utilized to support both the sickle mower blade 140 and the stationary mower blade 141. Moreover, the guard 146 is positioned in front of the sickle mower blade 140 and the stationary mower blade 141. A mower wheel 147 is provided at a distal end of the sickle mower blade 140 and the stationary mower blade 141. The mower wheel 147 is included to insure proper support of the sickle mower blade 140 and the stationary mower blade 141. The motor wheel 147 also ensures that the sickle mower blade 140 and the stationary motor blade 141 are horizontally oriented with respect to the ground surface 200. The sickle mower blade 140 and the stationary mower blade 141 work together in order to cut grass 300 when the wheel drive system 110 is pulling the sickle mower blade 140 as well as the stationary mower blade 141 along the rail 101. With respect to the above description, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationship for the various components of the invention 100, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function, and the manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention 100.
