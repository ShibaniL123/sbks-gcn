c) A mixture of 4-t-butylbenzene-1-sulfonyl chloride (0.080 g, 0.34 mmol), 3-(1,1-difluoroethyl)-1-(quinolin-5-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-amine (0.045 g, 0.16 mmol), and DMAP (0.020 g, 0.16 mmol) in pyridine (1 mL) was heated at 85° C. for 5 h with stirring. After cooling to room temperature, 1 M aqueous lithium hydroxide (1 mL) and 1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide (1 mL) were added to the reaction mixture. The resulting mixture was heated at 75° C. for 1.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was neutralized with 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2×10 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by reverse phase HPLC (C18 column, acetonitrile-H2O with 0.1% TFA as eluent) to give the title compound as a white solid (0.040 g, 0.085 mmol, 53%).
