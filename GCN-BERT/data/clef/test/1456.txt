Under an argon (Ar) atmosphere, 4.30 g of Compound A, 9.98 g of Compound B, 654 mg of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4), and 6.91 g of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) were added to a solvent of THF (200 ml)/water (50 ml) and deaerated. The reaction mixture was stirred and refluxed for 8 hours. After that, the reactant was cooled, extracted with chloroform, and washed with a saturated saline solution. The organic layer thus obtained was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated, and residues were separated by column chromatography to obtain 5.29 g (yield 72%) of Compound 1 as a white solid. The molecular weight of the compound measured by FAB-MS was 649. In addition, the chemical shift values of the compound measured by
