Synthesis of 2-methylthio-8-(propan-2-yl)aminopyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine-6-carbaldehyde
The 2-methylthio-8-(propan-2-yl)aminopyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-ylmethanol synthesized in Example 5 (3.1 g, 11.7 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (30 mL) and the solution was stirred at 0°C. Dess-Martin Periodinane (15 g, 35.2 mmol) was gradually added to the solution at 0°C, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for three hours. The reaction was monitored by LC/MS. After completion of the reaction, the reaction was quenched by addition of an aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution for reduction of excess reagent. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with dichloromethane (50 mL). The resultant organic phases were combined together and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solid was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to yield the title compound (2.9 g, 94%).
