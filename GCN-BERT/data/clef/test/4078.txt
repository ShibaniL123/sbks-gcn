Assembly for packaging a composition for coating keratin fibres The present invention relates to an assembly for packaging a cosmetic composition for coating keratin fibres, comprising a cosmetic composition for coating keratin fibres, and in particular the eyelashes, and a packaging device configured to store said composition. The present invention also relates to a process for coating keratin fibres, in particular a process for making up and optionally caring for the eyelashes. The composition used may in particular be in the form of an eyelash product such as a mascara, or an eyebrow product. More preferentially, the invention relates to a mascara. The term "mascara" is intended to mean a composition intended to be applied to the eyelashes: it may be an eyelash makeup composition, an eyelash makeup base (also known as a base coat), a composition to be applied over a mascara, also known as a top coat, or else a cosmetic composition for treating the eyelashes. The mascara is more particularly intended for human eyelashes, but also false eyelashes. Mascaras are in particular prepared according to two types of formulation: water-based mascaras known as cream mascaras, in the form of a dispersion of waxes in water; anhydrous mascaras or mascaras with a low water content, known as waterproof mascaras, in the form of dispersions of waxes in organic solvents. The present patent application more specifically relates to water-based mascaras. Water-based mascaras are conventionally presented in opaque packaging devices. The reason for this is that the intensity of the colour of mascaras is often dull and greyish, which makes them relatively unattractive. Furthermore, water-based mascaras based on waxes are relatively unstable and may aggregate under the action of heat, which tends towards further accentuating their greyish colour. Thus, one aim of the present invention is to produce a mascara that is attractive to the user, especially by proposing an assembly comprising a water-based mascara with good colour intensity and good stability over time. More particularly, one aim of the present invention consists in stabilizing a direct emulsion that is rich in fatty substances, especially in waxes, without phase separation over time. An aim of the present patent application is more particularly to provide a stable mascara which has a texture that is sufficiently thick to obtain a charging deposit, of satisfactory consistency, allowing easy application to the eyelashes and an even deposit, i.e. a deposit that is smooth and uniform, even after two months stored at 4°C. An aim of the present patent application is more particularly to provide a stable mascara which has a texture that is sufficiently thick to obtain a charging deposit, of satisfactory consistency, allowing easy application to the eyelashes and an even deposit, i.e. a deposit that is smooth and uniform, even after two months stored at 45°C. An aim of the present patent application is more particularly to provide a stable mascara which has a texture that is sufficiently thick to obtain a charging deposit, of satisfactory consistency, allowing easy application to the eyelashes and an even deposit, i.e. a deposit that is smooth and uniform, even after two months stored at temperatures oscillating between 4°C and 45°C. An aim of the present patent application is more particularly to provide a mascara in which the waxes are uniformly dispersed. An aim of the present patent application is more particularly to provide a mascara in which the pigments are uniformly dispersed. An aim of the present invention is also to produce water-based mascaras of good colour intensity and good stability making it possible to exceed a high solids content, for example of greater than or equal to 40%. Consequently, one subject of the present invention is an assembly for packaging a composition, preferably for coating keratin fibres such as the eyelashes, comprising: - a composition, in particular for coating keratin fibres such as the eyelashes, more preferentially a mascara composition, comprising: i) an aqueous phase, ii) particles comprising at least one hard wax, preferentially in the form of at least an aqueous dispersion of hard wax particles, the hard wax(es) having a melting point ranging from 65 to 120°C, the hard wax(es) being present in a total content of greater than or equal to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, iii) a lamellar phase ίβ formed by an aqueous phase-structuring surfactant system, said surfactant system comprising a content of surfactant(s), preferably nonionic surfactant(s), of greater than or equal to 15% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, - a packaging device comprising a container for storing said composition, this container being at least partly transparent so that said composition contained in the container is directly visible through the container. Preferably, the surfactant system forming the lamellar phase Ι_β comprises: * at least one nonionic surfactant with an HLB value at 25°C of less than 8, and * at least one nonionic surfactant with an HLB value at 25°C of greater than or equal to 8. Preferably, the nonionic surfactant(s) with an HLB value at 25°C of less than 8 and the nonionic surfactant(s) with an HLB value at 25°C of greater than or equal to 8 correspond to formula (I) below: (ALK-[C(0)]a-[0]b)c-X (I) in which formula (I): - ALK is a C7-C23, preferably Cn-C2i and more preferentially C15-C17 alkyl group, a and b are integers between 0 and 100, c is an integer between 1 and 100, in particular between 1 and 3, preferably equal to 1 , a and b preferably being equal to 0, X is a (poly)oxyalkylene group optionally substituted and/or terminated with a hydroxyl group, X preferably being an oxyethylene group (CH2CH20)n or (OCH2CH2)n in which n is greater than or equal to 1 , for example between 1 and 200, said (poly)oxyalkylene group preferably being a polyethylene glycol or being the result of at least one substitution of a hydroxyl group, preferably chosen from (poly)glycerols. Preferably, the total content of hard wax(es) and optionally of additional wax(es) and the total content of surfactant system are such that the weight ratio of the hard wax(es) plus the additional wax(es) to the surfactant system is less than or equal to 1 .75, preferably strictly less than 1 .5, in particular between 1/3 and 1 .25, the composition comprising a solids content of greater than or equal to 42%, preferably 45% and more preferentially 48%. The term "additional wax(es)" means any wax other than a hard wax, such as one or more soft waxes. Preferably, the total content of hard wax(es) relative to the total content of surfactant system, and preferentially of nonionic surfactants corresponding to formula (I) below, should be considered for calculating the preferred weight ratio in the invention. Such a ratio is preferably less than or equal to 1.75, preferably strictly less than 1 .5 and in particular between 1/3 and 1.25. The group X is preferably chosen from: i) HO-(ALK-0)z-CH2-CH[(OALK)y-OH]-CH2-(0-ALK)x-(*) in which: - ALK, which may be identical or different, representing a C1 -C6 and in particular C1 -C4 alkylene group, preferably ethylene, - x, y and z being an integer between 0 and 200, it being understood that x+y+z is other than 0, x+y+z preferably being inclusively between 1 and 150 and in particular between 20 and 60; ii) H-(ALK-0)x-(*) and H-(0-ALK)x-(*), preferably is H-(0-ALK)x-(*) in which: - ALK, which may be identical or different, representing a C1 -C6 and in particular C1 -C4 ethylene group, preferably ethylene, - x is an integer other than 0 and preferably between 1 and 200. The nonionic surfactant(s) with an HLB value at 25°C of less than 8 and the nonionic surfactant(s) with an HLB value at 25°C of greater than or equal to 8 correspond to formula (Γ) below: ALK-(0-CH2-CH2)n-OH (Ι') in which formula (Γ): - ALK is a C8-C24, preferably C12-C22 and more preferentially Ci6-Ci8 alkyl group, n being an integer other than 0, between 1 and 200, preferably between 1 and 10 and better still between 2 and 6 for the nonionic surfactant(s) with an HLB value at 25°C of less than 8, preferably between 20 and 200 for the nonionic surfactant(s) with an HLB value at 25°C of greater than or equal to 8. According to one particular embodiment, the invention comprises: * at least one hard wax, preferentially in the form of at least an aqueous dispersion of hard wax particles, the hard wax(es) having a melting point ranging from 65 to 120°C, the hard wax(es) being present in a total content of greater than or equal to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, and * preferably at least an aqueous dispersion of particles of at least one film-forming polymer, the film-forming polymer(s) preferably being present in a solids content of greater than or equal to 5% by weight and preferably 10% by weight relative to the total weight of said composition. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the inventors of the present application have solved this (these) problem(s) by means of such a composition. In particular, a composition in accordance with the invention gives rise to a water-based mascara composition which gives a strong colour intensity. Furthermore, the invention makes it possible to formulate water-based mascaras that may be rich in solids, especially in fatty substances, and that are stable, having a homogeneous and uniform dispersion of waxes, even after 2 months whether at 45°C or at 4°C. Finally, this mascara has good dispersion of the pigments and waxes, and is smooth and glossy. Such a composition is still pleasant upon application, comfortable and has a volumizing effect. Furthermore, this composition has a reinforced water content when film-forming polymer particles are present. According to the inventors, the combination of surfactants as described above allows an excellent compromise in terms of colour intensity, texture and cosmeticity and makes it possible, contrary to all expectation in the field of water-based mascaras, to condition these mascaras in a transparent container. Furthermore, it would have been difficult to envisage such surfactants with thickening nature in a formula rich in hard waxes and with a high solids content.

COMPOSITION A composition of an assembly according to the invention, in particular for coating keratin fibres such as the eyelashes, more preferentially a mascara composition, comprises: i) an aqueous phase, ii) particles comprising at least one hard wax, preferentially in the form of at least an aqueous dispersion of hard wax particles, the hard wax(es) having a melting point ranging from 65 to 120°C, the hard wax(es) being present in a total content of greater than or equal to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, iii) a lamellar phase Ι_β formed by an aqueous phase-structuring surfactant system, said surfactant system comprising a content of surfactant(s) of greater than or equal to 15% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. Aqueous phase The composition of an assembly according to the invention comprises an aqueous phase, which may form a continuous phase of the composition. The aqueous phase comprises water. It may also comprise at least one water-soluble solvent. In the present invention, the term "water-soluble solvent" denotes a compound that is liquid at room temperature and water-miscible. The water-soluble solvents that may be used in the compositions according to the invention may also be volatile. Among the water-soluble solvents that may be used in the compositions in accordance with the invention, mention may be made in particular of lower monoalcohols containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as ethanol and isopropanol, and glycols containing from 2 to 8 carbon atoms such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1 ,3- butylene glycol and dipropylene glycol. The aqueous phase (water and optionally the water-miscible solvent) is generally present in the composition according to the present patent application in a content ranging from 30% to 80% by weight and preferably ranging from 40% to 70% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. This aqueous phase content includes not only the water originating from the aqueous dispersions of film-forming polymers, and, where appropriate, aqueous dispersions of hard waxes, in accordance with the invention, but also, where appropriate, the water deliberately added to the composition. Solids content The composition according to the invention advantageously comprises a solids content of greater than or equal to 40%, in particular 42%, more particularly 45%, or even 48%, and preferentially 50%. For the purposes of the present invention, the "solids content" denotes the content of non-volatile matter. The solids content (abbreviated as SC) of a composition according to the invention is measured using a "Halogen Moisture Analyzer HR 73" commercial halogen desiccator from Mettler Toledo. The measurement is performed on the basis of the weight loss of a sample dried by halogen heating, and thus represents the percentage of residual matter once the water and the volatile matter have evaporated off. This technique is fully described in the machine documentation supplied by Mettler Toledo. The measuring protocol is as follows: Approximately 2 g of the composition, referred to hereinbelow as the sample, are spread out on a metal crucible, which is placed in the halogen desiccator mentioned above. The sample is then subjected to a temperature of 105°C until a constant weight is obtained. The wet mass of the sample, corresponding to its initial mass, and the dry mass of the sample, corresponding to its mass after halogen heating, are measured using a precision balance. The experimental error associated with the measurement is of the order of plus or minus 2%. The solids content is calculated in the following manner: Solids content (expressed as weight percentage) = 100 χ (dry mass/wet mass).

It may also be capable of dispersing the film-forming polymer particles, but the film-forming polymer particles may have their own surfactant system, different from that which is suitable for dispersing the hard wax particles and optionally the additional wax(es). The Griffin HLB (hydrophilic/lipophilic balance) value is defined in J. Soc. Cosm. Chem. 1954 (volume 5), pages 249-256.

Preferably, a composition comprises at least one nonionic surfactant with an HLB value, in the Griffin sense, at 25°C, of greater than or equal to 8 and preferably greater than or equal to 10, chosen from at least one ether of a C8-C24 , preferably Ci2- C22 and more preferentially Ci6-Ci8, fatty alcohol and of polyethylene glycol, said ether comprising at least 20 ethylene glycol units and better still between 20 and 200 ethylene glycol units. A composition according to the invention has a content of nonionic surfactant(s) with an H LB value, in the Griffin sense, at 25°C of greater than or equal to 8, preferably greater than or equal to 10, of greater than or equal to 5% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, preferably between 8% and 20% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. Nonionic surfactant(s) with an HLB value at 25°C of less than 8 The nonionic surfactant(s) with an HLB value, in the Griffin sense, at 25°C, of less than 8 may be advantageously chosen from: - (poly)oxyalkylenated saccharide esters and ethers; - esters of fatty acids, especially of C8-C24 and preferably of Ci6- C22, and of (poly)oxyalkylenated polyol, especially of (poly)oxyalkylenated glycerol or of (poly)oxyalkylenated sorbitol, preferably of (poly)oxyalkylenated glycerol; - (poly)oxyalkylenated alcohols; - and mixture(s) thereof; preferably, from (poly)oxyalkylenated alcohols preferably comprising from 1 to 10 oxyethylene units. The term "(poly)oxyalkylenated" means from 1 to 10 oxyethylene groups (or units) and better still from 2 to 6 oxyethylene groups. The at least one from among the nonionic surfactant(s) with an HLB value at 25°C of less than 8 preferably comprises a (poly)oxyalkylenated alcohol comprising an ether of a C8-C24 fatty alcohol and of polyethylene glycol, said ether comprising from 1 to 10 and better still between 2 and 6 ethylene glycol units.

Preferably, a composition in accordance with the invention is free of anionic surfactant(s). Preferably, a composition in accordance with the invention is free of amphoteric surfactant(s). Moreover, the surfactant system may comprise one or more co-surfactants chosen from fatty alcohols comprising from 10 to 26 carbon atoms, better still from 12 to 24 carbon atoms and even better still from 14 to 22 carbon atoms. Lamellar phase LB The surfactant system in accordance with the invention is organized in the form of a lamellar phase 1_β, or paracrystalline phase ίβ, or lamellar gel phase. This composition is stable at a room temperature of 25°C, having a viscosity preferentially ranging from 5 to 50 Pa.s, measured at a room temperature of 25°C using a Rheomat RM 100® rheometer. The term "lamellar gel phase or paracrystalline phase ίβ" means a phase in which the surfactant molecules and/or more generally the molecules of amphiphilic compounds are organized in the form of bimolecular layers spaced apart by aqueous leaflets. Within the bimolecular layers, the molecules are distributed in a hexagonal geometry, their hydrocarbon-based chains are in a crystalline state and are oriented perpendicular to the plane of the bimolecular layers but have no specific orientation relative to each other in the plane of these layers. The paracrystalline phases ί,β are metastable phases in which the fatty chains are in solid form and are arranged randomly relative to each other, unlike the miceliar, hexagonal, cubic and lamellar fluid paracrystalline phases (La) in which the fatty chains are in liquid form, and unlike the crystalline phases in which the fatty chains are in solid form and oriented in an ordered manner relative to each other. The paracrystalline phases 1_β are metastable and, in general, they have a tendency to evolve towards crystallization. Now, the Applicant has found a particular surfactant system that makes it possible to obtain a stable paracrystalline phase Ι_β, and thus cosmetic compositions for coating keratin fibres, in particular the eyelashes, which are stable and comfortable to apply, with good wear property and volume, by using a particular system of surfactant type in particular contents. To identify the lamellar gel phase or paracrystalline phase 1_β of the surfactant system present in the composition of the invention, use may be made of various techniques, and especially the technique of X-ray scattering. Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) X-ray diagrams were recorded by a Mar345 image plate detector (Maresearch, Norderstedt, Germany) mounted on a FR591 rotary anode X-ray generator (Brijker, Courtaboeuf, France), used at 50 kV and at 50 mA. The monochromatic CuKa radiation (λ = 1 .541 A) was focused with a 350 μηη focal spot at 320 mm by double reflection on an elliptic cross section multilayer Montel mirror (Incoatec, Geesthacht, Germany). The beam was defined under vacuum by four motorized carbon-tungsten slits (JJ-Xray, Roskilde, Denmark) positioned in front of the mirror (500 μηη). Four additional guard slits were placed at the focal point with a 220 mm slit separation. The flux after the output mica windows was 3 x 108 photons/s. A 2-mm diameter circular metal wire beam stop was placed in air at 150 mm after the sample, and the detector was positioned at 360 mm. The X-ray diagrams were therefore recorded for a range of reciprocal spacing q = 47i*sin θ/λ of 0.03-1.8 A"1, in which Θ is the scattering angle. The repetitive distances d = 27i/q should be between 200 A and 3.5 A. The samples were placed in 1.2-1 .3 mm glass capillaries (Glas W. Muller, Germany) and introduced into a home-made capillary holder accommodating up to 20 capillaries at controlled temperature. Particles The compositions of an assembly according to the present invention comprise hard wax particles and preferably film-forming polymers, which are preferentially in aqueous dispersion form. These particles may be characterized by a mean particle size. Such particles are generally isotropic, especially substantially spherically shaped or spherically shaped. Particle size A particle size can be measured by various techniques. Mention may in particular be made of the (dynamic and static) light scattering techniques, Coulter capture methods, measurements of sedimentation rates (related to the size via Stokes law) and microscopy. These techniques make it possible to measure a particle diameter and some make it possible to measure a particle size distribution. Preferably, the particle sizes and size distributions of the compositions according to the invention are measured by static light scattering using a commercial particle size analyser such as the MasterSizer 2000 from Malvern. The data are processed on the basis of the Mie scattering theory. This theory, which is exact for isotropic particles, makes it possible to determine, in the case of non-spherical particles, an "effective" particle diameter. This theory is especially described in the publication by Van de Hulst, H.C., Light Scattering by Small Particles, Chapters 9 and 10, Wiley, New York, 1957. In the context of the present invention, the "mean particle size" is expressed as volume mean "effective" diameter D[4,3], defined in the following way: i where V, represents the volume of the particles of effective diameter d,. This parameter is in particular described in the technical documentation of the particle size analyser. The measurements are carried out at 25°C, on a diluted dispersion of particles. The "effective" diameter is obtained by taking a refractive index of 1.33 for water and an average refractive index of 1.45 for the particles. Thus, preferentially, the particles of the compositions in accordance with the invention, comprising at least one hard wax and preferably at least one film-forming polymer, which are preferentially present in the form of aqueous dispersions, have a mean size expressed as the volume-mean "effective" diameter D[4,3] of less than or equal to 5 μηη, in particular strictly less than δμηη, more preferentially 2 μηη and even more preferentially less than or equal to 1 μηη. Such particle sizes preferentially correspond to the size of the particles in the final composition. This mean particle size is advantageous as regards the use of the composition in accordance with the present invention when compared with compositions comprising hard wax particles and film-forming polymers of larger sizes, which result in a mascara that is difficult or even impossible to formulate, granular, too thick, which cannot be applied (too compact and does not disintegrate), which is uncomfortable, which has poor dispersion of the pigments and fillers, and which has a matt colour. It is understood that the surfactant system(s) will have a tendency to position itself (themselves) at the interface of the aqueous phase and of the hard wax particles, and optionally of the film-forming polymer particles, in order to stabilize them. The measured particle sizes are thus measured in the presence of the surfactants, since they are difficult to dissociate from the particles. The sizes measured and given take this feature into account. As regards the other particles of the composition, for example dyestuffs and fillers, these compounds will be dealt with independently in another paragraph of the description, the size characteristics of particles of this type differing from the particle sizes of the waxes and film-forming polymers in accordance with the invention. Wax(es) The wax(es) are generally a lipophilic compound that is solid at room temperature (25°C), with a solid/liquid reversible change of state, having a melting point of greater than or equal to 30°C, which may be up to 200°C and in particular up to 120°C. For the purposes of the invention, the melting point corresponds to the temperature of the most endothermic peak observed on thermal analysis (DSC) as described in standard ISO 1 1357-3; 1999. The melting point of the wax may be measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), for example the calorimeter sold under the name DSC Q2000 by the company TA Instruments. Preferably, the waxes have a heat of fusion AHf of greater than or equal to 70 J/g. Preferably, the waxes comprise at least one crystallizable part, which is visible by X-ray observation. The measurement protocol is as follows: A 5 mg sample of wax placed in a crucible is subjected to a first temperature increase from -20°C to 120°C, at a heating rate of 10°C/minute, and then is cooled from 120°C to -20°C at a cooling rate of 10°C/rminute and finally subjected to a second temperature increase from - 20°C to 120°C at a heating rate of 5°C/minute. During the second temperature increase, the following parameters are measured: - the melting point (Mp) of the wax, as mentioned previously corresponding to the temperature of the most endothermic peak of the melting curve observed, representing the variation of the difference in power absorbed as a function of the temperature, - AHf: the heat of fusion of the wax, corresponding to the integral of the entire melting curve obtained. This heat of fusion of the wax is the amount of energy required to make the compound change from the solid state to the liquid state. It is expressed in J/g. The wax(es) may be hydrocarbon-based waxes, fluoro waxes and/or silicone waxes and may be of plant, mineral, animal and/or synthetic origin. The wax(es) may be present in a total content of greater than or equal to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition and better still 15% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. Preferably, they are present in a content ranging from 10% to 30% by weight and better still from 15% to 30% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. A composition according to the invention comprises at least one hard wax, preferably present in the preparation of the composition in the form of an aqueous dispersion of wax particles. Hard wax According to the invention, the composition more specifically comprises at least one hard wax. For the purposes of the present invention, the term "hard wax" means a wax with a melting point ranging from 65 to 120°C and more preferentially between 70 and 100°C. Advantageously, for the purposes of the present invention, the term "hard" wax means a wax having, at 20°C, a hardness of greater than 5 MPa, especially ranging from 5 to 30 MPa, preferably greater than 6 MPa and better still ranging from 6 to 25 MPa. To take these hardness measurements, the wax is melted at a temperature equal to the melting point of the wax +20°C. To do this, 30 g of wax are placed in a 100 ml beaker 50 mm in diameter, which is itself placed on a magnetic-stirring hotplate. An amount of about 15 g of molten wax is poured into a stainless-steel container 80 mm in diameter and 15 mm deep preheated to 45°C in an oven. The wax is then left to recrystallize in a room thermostatically maintained at 20°C for 24 hours before taking the measurement. The mechanical properties of the wax or of the mixture of waxes are determined in a room thermostatically maintained at 20°C, using a texturometer sold under the name TA-XT2i by the company Swantech, equipped with a stainless-steel cylinder 2 mm in diameter. The measurement comprises three steps: a first step after automatic detection of the surface of the sample, where the spindle moves at a measuring speed of 0.1 mm/s, and penetrates into the wax to a penetration depth of 0.3 mm, the software notes the maximum force value reached; a second "relaxation" step where the spindle remains at this position for one second and the force is noted after 1 second of relaxation; finally, a third "withdrawal" step in which the spindle returns to its initial position at a speed of 1 mm/s, and the probe withdrawal energy (negative force) is noted. The hardness value corresponds to the maximum measured compression force in newtons divided by the area of the texturometer cylinder, expressed in mm2, in contact with the wax. The hardness value obtained is expressed in megapascals or MPa.

Preferably, the wax particles used in the preparation of a composition in accordance with the present invention are not introduced in the form of a microdispersion of pre-prepared hard waxes, as described in patent applications FR 2 687 569 or FR 2 815 849. Specifically, the hard wax(es) used in a composition in accordance with the present invention are introduced in powder or solid fatty substance form. However, the final composition may be defined as comprising an aqueous dispersion of hard wax(es). Specifically, according to the present manufacturing process, the hard wax dispersion is prepared in situ, making it possible, surprisingly and advantageously, to achieve high solids contents and high contents of hard wax(es), which would be unachievable if a pre- prepared microdispersion of hard waxes were to be introduced as such for manufacturing a cosmetic composition according to the invention. Specifically, in the present invention, the water derived from the aqueous dispersion of film-forming polymer(s) serves to prepare the dispersion of hard wax(es). The hard wax(es) are preferably polar. The term "polar" wax means a wax whose solubility parameter calculated above its melting point δ3 is other than 0 (J/cm3)½. In particular, the term "polar" wax means a wax whose chemical structure is formed essentially from, or even constituted of, carbon and hydrogen atoms, and comprising at least one highly electronegative heteroatom such as an oxygen, nitrogen, silicon or phosphorus atom. The definition and calculation of the solubility parameters in the Hansen three- dimensional solubility space are described in the article by CM. Hansen: The three- dimensional solubility parameters, J. Paint Technol. 39, 105 (1967). According to this Hansen space: - δ0 characterizes the London dispersion forces derived from the formation of dipoles induced during molecular impacts; - δρ characterizes the Debye interaction forces between permanent dipoles and also the Keesom interaction forces between induced dipoles and permanent dipoles; - 8h characterizes the specific interaction forces (such as hydrogen bonding, acid/base, donor/acceptor, etc.); and - 8a is determined by the equation: 8a = (δρ2 + 8h2)½ The parameters δρ, 8h, 5D and 8a are expressed in (J/cm3)½. The composition according to the invention comprises a content of hard wax(es), preferentially present in aqueous dispersion form, of greater than or equal to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition and better still 15% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. More generally, the composition according to the invention advantageously comprises a total content of hard wax(es), preferentially present in aqueous dispersion form, ranging from 10% to 30% by weight and better still from 15% to 30% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition. According to an advantageous embodiment, the composition according to the invention comprises a total content of hard wax particles preferentially present in aqueous dispersion form such that they represent at least 80% by weight, preferentially at least 90% by weight and even more preferentially 100% by weight relative to the total weight of wax(es). Preferably, the total content of hard wax(es), preferentially present in aqueous dispersion form, is greater than or equal to 30% by weight and preferentially 40% by weight relative to the total weight of solid particles. According to an advantageous embodiment, the total content of hard wax(es), preferentially present in aqueous dispersion form, represents at least 80% by weight, preferentially at least 90% by weight and even more preferentially 100% by weight relative to the total weight of fatty substances. Additionally, a composition according to the invention may comprise at least one soft wax, present in the form of an aqueous dispersion of wax or non-wax particles, i.e. particles whose melting point is strictly less than 50°C, and optionally whose hardness is strictly less than 5 MPa. However, a composition according to the invention preferably comprises less than 5% by weight of soft wax(es), preferably less than 2% by weight of soft wax(es), and even more preferentially is free of soft wax(es). Film-forming polymer(s) The composition of an assembly according to the invention preferably comprises at least an aqueous dispersion of film-forming polymer particles and optionally at least one additional film-forming polymer (not present in the form of an aqueous dispersion of particles, such as a water-soluble film-forming polymer). In the present patent application, the term "film-forming polymer" is intended to mean a polymer that is capable, by itself or in the presence of an auxiliary film-forming agent, of forming a macroscopically continuous deposit, and preferably a cohesive deposit, and even better still a deposit of which the cohesion and mechanical properties are such that said deposit can be isolated and manipulated individually, for example when said deposit is prepared by pouring onto a non-stick surface such as a Teflon- coated or silicone-coated surface. A composition according to the invention preferably comprises a total solids content of film-forming polymer(s) of greater than or equal to 5% by weight, preferably 10% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition, and better still 12% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition. A composition according to the invention preferably comprises a total solids content of film-forming polymer(s) ranging from 10% to 30% by weight and better still from 12% to 25% relative to the total weight of the composition. The composition according to the invention preferably comprises more specifically at least an aqueous dispersion of particles formed from one or more film- forming polymers. It may also comprise at least one water-soluble film-forming polymer. Thus, a composition may comprise at least one additional film-forming polymer, different from the film-forming polymer particles present in aqueous dispersion form. The content of these "water-soluble" additional film-forming polymer(s) is preferably less than or equal to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, even more preferentially 5% by weight and better still 2% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. Film-forming polymer(s) in aqueous dispersion Such a film-forming polymer present in said preparation of the composition in the form of particles in aqueous dispersion is generally known as a (pseudo)latex, i.e. a latex or psuedolatex. Techniques for preparing these dispersions are well known to those skilled in the art. A dispersion that is suitable for use in the invention may comprise one or more types of particle, these particles possibly varying as regards their size, their structure and/or their chemical nature. A composition according to the invention comprises a total solids content of film-forming polymer particles in aqueous dispersion form of greater than or equal to 10% by weight. Advantageously, a composition according to the invention comprises a total solids content of film-forming polymer particles in aqueous dispersion form of greater than or equal to 12% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition and preferably 15% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition.

These particles may be of anionic, cationic or neutral nature and may constitute a mixture of particles of different nature. Among the film-forming polymers that may be used in the composition of the present invention, mention may be made of synthetic polymers, of free-radical type or of polycondensate type, and polymers of natural origin, and mixtures thereof. In general, these polymers may be statistical polymers, block copolymers of A-B type, of A- B-A or ABCD, etc. multiblock type, or even grafted polymers. Free-radical film-forming polymer The term "free-radical polymer" means a polymer obtained by polymerization of unsaturated and especially ethylenically unsaturated monomers, each monomer being capable of homopolymerizing (unlike polycondensates). The film-forming polymers of free-radical type may especially be acrylic and/or vinyl homopolymers or copolymers. The vinyl film-forming polymers may result from the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing at least one acid group and/or esters of these acid monomers and/or amides of these acid monomers.

Various types of aqueous dispersion, especially commercial dispersions, which are suited to the preparation of the composition in accordance with the present invention are detailed below. 1/ Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the aqueous dispersion of polymer particles is an aqueous dispersion of acrylic polymer. The acrylic polymer can be a styrene/acrylate copolymer and especially a polymer chosen from copolymers resulting from the polymerization of at least one styrene monomer and at least one Ci-Ci8 alkyl (meth)acrylate monomer.

The C-i-C-18 alkyl (meth)acrylate monomer is in particular a C1-C12 alkyl (meth)acrylate and more particularly a C1-C10 alkyl (meth) acrylate.

The anionic nature of the polyester-polyurethanes and of the polyether- polyurethanes used according to the invention is due to the presence in their constituent units of groups bearing a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid function. The polyester-polyurethane or polyether-polyurethane particles used according to the invention are generally sold in aqueous dispersion form. The particle content of said dispersions currently available on the market ranges from approximately 20% to approximately 60% by weight relative to the total weight of the dispersion. Among the anionic polyester-polyurethane dispersions that may be used in the compositions according to the invention, mention may be made in particular of the product sold under the name Avalure UR 405® by the company Noveon or Baycusan C1004 by the company Bayer Material Science. Among the anionic polyether-polyurethane particle dispersions that may be used according to the invention, mention may be made in particular of the products sold under the name Avalure UR 450® by the company Noveon and under the name Neorez R 970® by the company DSM. According to a particular embodiment of the invention, use may be made of a mixture of commercial dispersions consisting of anionic polyester-polyurethane particles as defined above and of anionic polyether-polyurethane particles also defined above. For example, use may be made of a mixture consisting of the dispersion sold under the name Sancure 861® or a mixture of the product sold under the name Avalure UR 405® and of the product sold under the name Avalure UR 450®, these dispersions being sold by the company Noveon. 3/ According to another particular embodiment of the invention, the aqueous dispersion used comprises a mixture of at least two film-forming polymers in the form of particles that differ by their respective glass transition temperatures (Tg). In particular, according to one embodiment of the invention, the composition in accordance with the invention may comprise at least a first film-forming polymer in dispersed form and at least a second film-forming polymer in dispersed form, said first and second polymers having different Tg values and, preferably, the Tg of the first polymer (Tg1 ) is higher than the Tg of the second polymer (Tg2). In particular, the difference between the Tg1 and Tg2 values is, as an absolute value, at least 10°C and preferably at least 20°C. More precisely, it comprises in an acceptable aqueous medium: a) particles dispersed in the aqueous medium of a first film-forming polymer having at least one glass transition temperature Tg1 greater than or equal to 20°C, and b) particles dispersed in the aqueous medium of a second film-forming polymer having at least one glass transition temperature Tg2 less than or equal to 70°C. This dispersion generally results from a mixing of two aqueous dispersions of film-forming polymer. The first film-forming polymer has at least one, and especially has one, glass transition temperature Tg1 of greater than or equal to 20°C, especially ranging from 20°C to 150°C and advantageously greater than or equal to 40°C, especially ranging from 40°C to 150°C and in particular greater than or equal to 50°C, especially ranging from 50°C to 150°C. The second film-forming polymer has at least one, and especially has one, glass transition temperature Tg2 less than or equal to 70°C, especially ranging from -120°C to 70°C, in particular less than 50°C, especially ranging from -60°C to +50°C and more particularly ranging from -30°C to 30°C. The measurement of the glass transition temperature (Tg) of a polymer is performed by DMTA (dynamic and mechanical temperature analysis) as described below. To measure the glass transition temperature (Tg) of a polymer, viscoelasticity tests are performed with a "Polymer Laboratories" DMTA machine, on a sample of film. This film is prepared by pouring the aqueous dispersion of film-forming polymer in a Teflon-coated matrix followed by drying at 120°C for 24 hours. A film is then obtained, from which specimens are cut out (for example using a punch). These specimens are typically about 150 μηι thick, from 5 to 10 mm wide and have a useful length of about 10 to 15 mm. A tensile stress is imposed on this sample. The sample undergoes a static force of 0.01 N on which is superimposed a sinusoidal displacement of ± 8 m at a frequency of 1 Hz. The test is thus performed in the linear range, at low levels of deformation. This tensile stress is performed on the sample at temperatures ranging from -150°C to +200°C, with a temperature variation of 3°C per minute. The complex modulus E* = E' + iE" of the polymer tested is thus measured as a function of the temperature. From these measurements, the dynamic moduli E' and E" and the damping power: tg8 = E7E' are deduced. The curve of the Tg8 values is then plotted as a function of the temperature; this curve presents at least one peak. The glass transition temperature Tg of the polymer corresponds to the temperature at the top of this peak. When the curve presents at least two peaks (in this case, the polymer has at least two Tg values), the value taken as the Tg of the polymer tested is the temperature for which the curve presents a peak of the largest amplitude (i.e. corresponding to the largest Tg value; in this case, only the "major" Tg is considered as the Tg value of the polymer tested). In the present invention, the transition temperature Tg1 corresponds to the "major" Tg (in the predefined sense) of the first film-forming polymer when the latter has at least two Tg values; the glass transition temperature Tg2 corresponds to the "major" Tg of the second film-forming polymer when the latter has at least two Tg values. The first film-forming polymer and the second film-forming polymer may be chosen, independently of each other, from free-radical polymers, polycondensates and polymers of natural origin as defined previously having the glass transition temperature characteristics defined previously. As first film-forming polymer in aqueous dispersion, use may be made of the aqueous polymer dispersions sold under the names Neorez R-989® by the company DSM, Joncryl 95 and Joncryl®821 1 by the company BASF. As second film-forming polymer in aqueous dispersion, use may be made, for example, of the aqueous polymer dispersions sold under the names Avalure® UR-405, Avalure® UR-460 by the company Noveon or Acrilem IC89RT® by the company ICAP, and Neocryl A-45 by the company DSM.

PACKAGING DEVICE A packaging assembly according to the present invention comprises a packaging device that is capable of receiving said cosmetic composition in accordance with the invention. The packaging device comprises a transparent container for housing the composition for coating keratin fibres. This composition may then be withdrawn from the container by immersing an applicator therein. This applicator may be firmly attached to a member for closing the container. This closing member may form a member for gripping the applicator. This gripping member may form a cap to be removably mounted on said container by any suitable means, such as screwing, click-fastening, coupling, etc. Such a container may thus reversibly house said applicator. This container may be optionally equipped with a wiper suitable for removing surplus product taken up by the applicator. According to the invention, the container is transparent. In particular, this container advantageously comprises a body, which is closed at one end by a base and open at an opposite end. More particularly, the body of the container may comprise a neck forming a shoulder from which the aperture raises. This aperture may receive the wiper inside. Such an aperture may be reversibly closed by a cap. This cap preferably supports the applicator intended to coat the keratin fibres with a composition according to the invention. According to an advantageous embodiment, at least the body of the container is transparent. According to a particular embodiment, the body, the neck and the base of the container are transparent. To produce such a packaging device, it is possible to make this container of a transparent thermoplastic material, for example by injection-moulding, or of glass, for example by injection blow-moulding. For example, such a container may be made of a transparent thermoplastic material chosen from the group consisting of PET and PMMA. According to a particular embodiment, such a device may comprise means for heating a composition in accordance with the invention. HEATING MEANS A packaging device in accordance with the invention may comprise heating means so that a composition in accordance with the invention can be subjected to these heating means before and/or during application. These heating means may be integrally fastened to an assembly for coating keratin fibres and more particularly to an applicator configured to apply said cosmetic composition for coating keratin fibres, and optionally, where appropriate, to a conditioning device suitable for receiving said composition. These heating means are then suitable for melting at least part of the fatty phase, and especially at least part of the surfactant system and, where appropriate, at least part of the soft wax(es), and optionally at least part of the hard wax particles. The wax particles are heated to a temperature Tc such that only part of the crystallizable chains are melted. The heating means may also come into contact with or face the composition to be heated. The composition may be heated while it is contained in a packaging device. The composition may be heated while it is at least partially exposed to the ambient air. The composition may be locally heated to a temperature greater than or equal to 45°C, or even greater than or equal to 50°C, or even greater than or equal to 55°C. The temperature of the composition should not entail any risk of burning at the time of application. This is why when the composition is heated before application, a waiting time between the moment at which the composition is heated and the application to the keratin materials may optionally be necessary. According to one embodiment variant, the composition is heated simultaneously with its application to the keratin fibres. According to another variant, the composition is heated before and during its application to the keratin fibres. The temperature to which at least part of the composition is heated may be inclusively between 45°C and 95°C, better still 50°C to 85°C and better still 55°C to 75°C. The temperature may be measured, for example, at the surface using an infrared pyrometer, for example a Fluke® brand machine. The composition in accordance with the invention is capable of passing from a solid state to an at least partially liquid or even totally liquid state, and of doing so reversibly. The solid/liquid change of state is at least partly due to the melting of a crystalline part, in particular of the wax(es) described previously in the present description. The total heat of fusion of the composition is the heat consumed by the composition between -20°C and 120°C. The total heat of fusion of the composition is equal to the area under the curve of the thermogram obtained using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), such as the calorimeter sold under the name MDSC 2920 by the company TA Instrument, with a temperature rise of 5°C or 10°C per minute, according to standard ISO 1 1357-3:1999. Measuring protocol: A 5 mg sample of composition is placed in a crucible and subjected to a first temperature rise ranging from -20°C to 120°C, at a heating rate of 10°C/minute, and is then cooled from 120°C to -20°C at a cooling rate of 10°C/minute. The sample is maintained at -20°C for 5 minutes and finally subjected to a second temperature rise ranging from -20°C to 100°C at a heating rate of 5°C / minute. During the second temperature rise, the variation in the difference in power absorbed by an empty crucible and by the crucible containing the sample of the composition is measured as a function of the temperature. The melting point of the compound is the value of the temperature corresponding to the top of the peak of the curve representing the variation in the difference in power absorbed as a function of the temperature. The heat of fusion of the composition consumed at the temperature Tc is the amount of energy required to make the compound pass from the solid or very viscous state at -20°C to the state of the composition at the temperature Tc. It is expressed in J/g. According to one embodiment of the invention, the composition is chosen such that the ratio of the heat consumed between -20°C and Tc by the product to the total heat consumed between -20°C and 120°C is less than or equal to 0.7. This relationship is confirmed, for example, for a temperature Tc of the composition of between 45°C and 80°C. The choice of the temperature Tc to which the composition is brought by the heating means may thus be made so that said ratio is less than or equal to 0.7, for example inclusively between 0.3 and 0.6. In other words, heating is performed to a temperature such that the ratio of the heat supplied to heat the sample of composition to the temperature Tc to the total heat is less than or equal to 0.7, such a parameter being measured according to the DSC protocol described above. Only the heated composition can come into contact with the keratin fibres, for example the eyelashes, during the application. Applicator A device of an assembly according to the invention preferably comprises an applicator for smoothing and/or separating keratin fibres, such as the eyelashes or the eyebrows, especially in the form of teeth, bristles or other reliefs. The applicator is arranged to apply the composition to the eyelashes or the eyebrows, and may comprise, for example, a brush or a comb. The applicator may also be used for finishing of the makeup, over a region of the eyelashes or eyebrows that is made up or laden with composition. The brush may comprise a twisted core and bristles held between the turns of the core, or may be made in yet another way. The comb is, for example, produced from a single part by moulding of a plastic. In certain embodiments, the application member is mounted at the end of a wand, which wand may be flexible, which may contribute to improving the comfort during application. Finally, it should be noted that the packaging and application assembly may be in the form of a kit, it being possible for the applicator and the packaging device to be housed separately in the same packaging article. A process for applying the composition according to the invention to the eyelashes or the eyebrows may also include the following steps: - forming a deposit of the cosmetic composition on the eyelashes or the eyebrows, - leaving the deposit on the eyelashes or the eyebrows, it being possible for the deposit to dry. The examples above and that follow are given as illustrations of the present invention, and shall not limit the scope thereof. EXAMPLE A mascara composition of an assembly in accordance with the invention is described below: Composition Ingredients according to with percentage contents the invention Phase A Carnauba Wax SP 63 from Strahl & Pitsch 12 Polymethylene wax (Cirebelle 108 from Cirebelle) 5 Oxyethylenated glyceryl monostearate (30 OE) (Tagat 4 S from Evonik Goldschmidt) Phase B Steareth 2 (B rij 72 fro m U n i q e m a ) 8 Steareth 20 (B rij 78P from U n iq e ma) 8 Pigments 10 Water 33 Phase C Water qs 100 Phase D Preserving agents qs This composition was prepared as follows: /'. Preparation of phase A: All the starting materials used are carefully weighed out using a balance (accuracy 0.01 g). The various waxes are melted in a 500 mL jacketed heating pan with circulation of hot oil to control the temperature. The mixture is heated to about 95-98°C. Once the waxes have melted, they are homogenized by stirring using a Moritz blender, which is stirring of rotor-stator type: this machine consists of a fixed part in which a second mobile part rotates at variable speed, and is used for making emulsions since it can produce a very high shear. Once the waxes are melted and homogenized, the oxyethylenated (30 OE) glyceryl monostearate is added and the mixture is emulsified for 10 minutes. ii. Preparation of phase B The ingredients are weighed out, the Steareth 2 and Steareth 20 in accordance with the invention are melted at 80°C, and the water preheated in an electric kettle to 95°C and the pigments are then added. iii. Mixing of phase B with phase A Phase A is added to phase B and the mixture is emulsified for 5 minutes at 95°C using a Moritz blender. iv. Preparation of phase C The water is poured into a bath thermostatically maintained at 5°C. v. Mixing of phase A+B with phase C Phase A+B (hot emulsion at 95°C) is poured into the thermostatic bath containing phase C. vi. Addition of phase D Phase D is poured into the phase A+B+C mixture when the temperature of the mixture is less than or equal to 45°C. vii. End of formulation The mascara thus obtained is transferred into a closed jar to prevent it from drying out on contact with air; it is then necessary to wait 24 hours to check the homogeneity of the formulation and the correct dispersion of the pigments. Such a composition is packaged in a packaging device comprising a transparent container through which the mascara composition is directly visible. 21 Protocols and results The composition prepared is observed with the naked eye and by microscope. The composition according to the invention is a fine emulsion with a fine grain of well-distributed (homogeneous) wax(es). It has a fluid texture (viscosity at 25°C of 14.4 Pa.s measured using a Rheomat RM100® machine). Moreover, the pigments are well dispersed and the composition has an intense black colour. In addition, these compositions are stable at 4 and 45°C for two months. Furthermore, the composition obtained has good gloss and a particularly satisfactory black intensity. It should be noted that the protocols for measuring the gloss and the black intensity to be used in the context of the present invention are described in patent application FR 2 968 978, page 44, lines 1 -21 . When tested on a sample of naked eyelashes, these compositions, applied using a brush, are pleasant on application. The deposit is constructed coat after coat, the composition coats the eyelashes well, the makeup result is uniform and the eyelash fringe is well developed. In contrast with other water-based mascaras, the properties of a mascara in accordance with the invention are such that a transparent container containing it makes it possible to magnify the mascara and to give an idea of the black intensity qualities and optionally the gloss qualities of the packaged mascara, even after a long period of storage of the assembly. It is understood that, in the context of the present invention, the weight percentages given for a compound or a family of compounds are always expressed as weight of solids of the compound in question. Throughout the application, the wording "comprising one" or "including one" "comprising at least one" or "including at least one", unless otherwise specified. 1 .
