Step 1. 3-Bromo-4-methyl-N-[(3-methyloxetan-3-yl)methyl]benzenesulfonamide
To a solution of 3-bromo-4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (500.0 mg, 1.855 mmol) (Combi-Blocks, WZ-9240) in THF (10.0 mL) and pyridine (0.300 mL, 3.71 mmol) was added 1-(3-methyloxetan-3-yl)methanamine (225 mg, 2.22 mmol) (Combi-Blocks, SS-0093). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was then concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was added to 1.0 N HCl (100 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (2Ã—100 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with sat. Na2CO3 solution (100 mL) and brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via on silica gel chromatography (10-80% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound (296.0 mg, 48%). LCMS for C12H17BrNO3S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=334.0, 336.0; found 333.9, 335.9.
