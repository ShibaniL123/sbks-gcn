Example 31: Synthesis of compound 11200, N-(2-fluoro-4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)-1-methyl-N-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxamide
[Step 1] Synthesis of tert-butyl 4-((2-fluoro-4-(methoxycarbonyl)benzyl)(phenyl)carbamoyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 4-(phenylcarbamoyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (2.000 g, 6.571 mmol) synthesized in step 1 of Example 9 was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (80 mL), and sodium hydride (60.00 %, 0.526 g, 13.141 mmol) was added slowly to the solution while the temperature was maintained at 0°C. The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes, and methyl 4-(bromomethyl)-3-fluorobenzoate (1.948 g, 7.885 mmol) was added thereto, followed by additional stirring at 50°C for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature, and then water (20 mL) was added to the reaction mixture at 0°C, followed by stirring for 5 minutes. After completion of the reaction, water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 80 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 5% to 50%) and concentrated to give the title compound (2.600 g, 84.1%) as colorless oil.
