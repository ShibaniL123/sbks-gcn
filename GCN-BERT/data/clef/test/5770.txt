This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/711,998, filed Oct. 10, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth. FIELD The disclosure relates to plant extracts with anti-viral activity. BACKGROUND Extracts of some plant species have been shown to exhibit anti-viral activity. Viral infections are common infectious diseases. Common viral infections include infections with herpes simplex virus, poxviruses, or papaviruses. Poxviruses, members of the family poxviridae, are viruses such as smallpox, vaccinia, cowpox and monkey pox that infect both vertebrate and invertabrate animals. Papaviruses, members of the former virus family papovaviridae, include human papillovirus, which causes small benign tumors, known as papillomas or warts. Herpes simplex virus is a prevalent recurrent and chronic infection. Chronic outbreaks of lesions are common in persons infected with herpes simplex virus, occurring usually in mucous membrane areas and the surrounding skin. These lesions occur commonly as orofacial or genital lesions referred to as “cold sores” or “fever blisters,” or sexually transmitted diseases. There is currently no systemic cure for the herpes simplex virus. Shingles is associated with Herpes Zoster. SUMMARY In an aspect, the invention relates to a method of making a composition.

EXAMPLES The following non-limiting examples are provided to illustrate particular embodiments. The embodiments throughout may be supplemented with one or more detail from one or more example below, and/or one or more element from an embodiment may be substituted with one or more detail from one or more example below. Example 1 Substances have been identified in two Sargassum aquatic plants screened. Preliminary studies show that one of the substances may be an alkaloid residing in the basic fraction of plant sample extracts. The compound appears to be labile under basic conditions above pH 9. The other plant sample contains at least one substance that is extractable in either an alcohol or water. These substances may have anti-viral activity. Example 2 HSV-2 Confluent rat liver epithelial cells (WB) grown as monolayers in Corning T-25 tissue culture flasks are infected with 1 ml of either HSV-2 or vaccinia virus diluted in medium to yield between 100-250 plaques. A mock-infected negative control is always included. Cells so infected are incubated at 37 degrees C. for one hour to allow the virus to attach to cells. After the hour incubation, unadsorbed virus is washed off with serum-free medium and fed with medium containing the indicated amount of extract. The flasks are incubated for 48 hours. The cells are fixed with 2% formaldehyde in buffer (PBS) for 10 minutes before staining with crystal violet (1% in 35% methanol-PBS). Antiviral activity is measured as a percent reduction in the number of plaque forming units (pfu) compared to the untreated infected controls. The above assay has been conducted, and the results suggest that a substance existing in or on the product of example 1 is capable of inhibiting Herpes simplex II viral replication and transmission in mammalian cells. The extract used in this experiment was at the microgram per milliliter concentration level. Purification of plant extracts may include solvent extraction followed by chromatographic methods development. Compound structure using mass spectral, Infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and x-ray crystalographic analyses could be performed. Example 3 When Sargassum muticum was subjected to a 40% ethanol/60% H2O solution, and allowed to soak for a period of time after blending with a household blender, metabolites from within and on the plant surface were extracted into the solution upon standing. The blended plant and solution were subjected to vacuum filtration using a Buchner funnel with a vacuum flask and Whatman filter paper. The filtered solution was evaporated in a porcelain or glass evaporating dish at room temperature or under vacuum at 40 degrees Celsius or less. The residue was reconstituted in a 30% methanol/70% H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution to be used as a mobile phase in the High Performance Liquid Chromatographic analysis of the extract. A Gelman syringe filter with a Luer lock adapter for the syringe was used for the final filtration prior to injection into an HPLC Rheodyne injection system. The pump for the mobile phase ranged from 2200 to 2600 psi for a 1 ml per minute flow rate through the HPLC System comprising of an HPLC pump, stainless steel standard HPLC tubing ( 1/16 inch ID) running approximately 6 inches from the pump to the Rheodyne injection system then approximately 3-4 inches to the Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 Column (Column dimensions were 4.6×250 mm with 5 μm particle size and Serial Number USCL037662). The tubing was approximately 6 inches in length running from the column to a uv/vis Spectrophotometer containing a flow through cell. A 6 inch length stainless steel tube of the usual bore ( 1/16 inch ID) then delivered the eluent containing plant metabolites into the collection tubes. The mobile phase was collected continuously every 5 minutes from the time the sample was injected into the effluent of the HPLC system. Between ten minutes and twenty minutes, give or take a few minutes, a fraction was collected from the extract that contains metabolites that have an antiviral activity. This fraction was referred to as the “first fraction.” Between 35 to 45 minutes, a fraction began to elute the column. This fraction was referred to as the “second fraction.” The second fraction contains the most potent metabolites to elute the HPLC column. These two fractions are effective against Herpes simplex I and II, Vaccinia, smallpox, poxviruses and other double stranded DNA viruses. This includes Human papilloma virus among other viruses in this family. The mobile phase was isocratic, and the temperature was room temperature. It is understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but is intended to cover all modifications which are within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims; the above description; and/or shown in the attached drawings. 1.
