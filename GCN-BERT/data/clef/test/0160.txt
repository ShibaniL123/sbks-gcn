TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a coating composition that can impart high water repellency and oil repellency, to a method for producing the coating composition, and to a coated article. BACKGROUND ART Solid surfaces of glass, plastics, paper, textile products, metals and the like are often imparted with water repellency but are rarely imparted with oil repellency. However, in cases where a more pronounced anti-fouling effect against oil stains or the like needs to be imparted to such surfaces, it is desirable that the surface exhibits both a large contact angle and a small sliding angle not only with water, but also with low-surface tension substances typified by oils. Specifically, there is a demand for the formation of a coating film that combines both water repellency and oil repellency. Further, the coating film should preferably combine both high water repellency and high oil repellency, i.e. superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity. Patent Document 1 discloses a coating solution obtained by dispersing hydrophobic microparticles having an average primary particle size equal to or smaller than 100 nm in an organic solvent that contains 65 mass % or more of a hydrophobic solvent with respect to the total organic solvent. Patent Document 1 describes that a coating film formed by using the coating solution exhibits a contact angle of 140 degrees or more with water. Patent Document 2 discloses a coating film having a root-mean-square surface roughness (RMS) of 100 nm or greater, obtained through application of a coating composition that comprises an alcohol, an alkoxysilane, a perfluoroalkyl silane, silica microparticles, a catalyst that promotes the hydrolysis reaction of the alkoxysilane, and water. Patent Document 2 indicates that a coating film formed using that coating solution exhibits a contact angle of 150 degrees or more with water and 130 degrees or more with oils. Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2010-155727 Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2010-89373 SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problem While Patent Document 1 allows the simple formation of a superhydrophobic coating film, there is a problem in that the oil repellency of the coating film is insufficient. Since Patent Document 2 relies on a hydrolysis reaction, preparation of the coating solution requires time. Also, since a sufficient contact angle can not be obtained when the number of coating applications is small, there is a problem in that the number of process steps increases. Further, there is a problem in that cracks occur during drying of the coating films of Patent Documents 1 and 2. The present invention has been made to solve the above problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a coating composition that can form a coating film having few cracks and can impart high water repellency and high oil repellency without the need for a complex operation. Solution to the Problem A coating composition according to the present invention is characterized in that hydrophobic microparticles, and flat-shaped microparticles forming a card-house aggregate structure, are dispersed in a binder resin dissolved in a solvent. Advantageous Effects of the Invention The present invention succeeds in providing a coating composition that can form a coating film having few cracks and can impart high water repellency and high oil repellency without the need for a complex operation.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Embodiment 1 FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional diagram of a coated article comprising a coating film according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a schematic top-view diagram of a coated article comprising a coating film according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention. FIG. 3 is a schematic perspective-view diagram of a coated article comprising a coating film according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention. In these figures, a coating film 5 that comprises hydrophobic microparticles 2, flat-shaped microparticles 3 and a binder resin 4, is provided on the top face of a base material 1. The mass ratio of hydrophobic microparticles 2 to the binder resin 4 in the coating film 5 (mass of the hydrophobic microparticles 2/mass of the binder resin 4) is ordinarily 0.5 or greater, and ranges preferably from 0.5 to 12, more preferably from 2 to 8. Small irregularities are formed on the surface of the coating film 5 by virtue of the presence of the hydrophobic microparticles 2. That fine uneven structure on the surface allows the water repellency of the coating film 5 to be increased. A mass ratio of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 to the binder resin 4 smaller than 0.5 is undesirable since, in that case, a fine uneven structure may in some instances can not be formed over the entire surface of the coating film 5, which precludes obtaining a coating film 5 with desired water repellency. On the other hand, a mass ratio of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 to the binder resin 4 in excess of 12 is undesirable since the amount of binder resin is then excessively small, and, as a result, a coating film 5 with desired strength may not be obtained, and the coating film 5 may peel off the base material 1. A characterizing feature of the present invention is that the table faces and the end faces of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 in the coating film 5 are in contact with each other to form a card-house aggregate structure. Irregularities are formed on the surface of the coating film 5 by this card-house aggregate structure. These surface irregularities, which become compounded with the small irregularities formed by the hydrophobic microparticles 2, translate into a greater proportion of the liquid-gas contact surface area at the interface between the surface and a liquid according to the Cassie model; as a result, it becomes possible to bring out superlyophobicity towards liquids having a surface tension smaller than that of water. An uneven surface structure such as the one illustrated in FIG. 4 is obtained, and no oil repellency is achieved, in a case where the flat-shaped microparticles 3 do not form a card-house aggregate structure. This uneven surface structure is similar to an uneven surface structure that is formed in a case where no flat-shaped microparticles 3 are present (see FIG. 5). The mass ratio of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 to the flat-shaped microparticles 3 in the coating film 5 (mass of the hydrophobic microparticles 2/mass of the flat-shaped microparticles 3) is 0.5 or greater, and ranges preferably from 0.5 to 5, and more preferably from 1 to 2. Small irregularities are formed on the surface of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 by virtue of the presence of the hydrophobic microparticles 2. This fine uneven structure on the surface allows the oil repellency of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 in the coating film 5 to be enhanced. A mass ratio of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 to the flat-shaped microparticles 3 smaller than 0.5 is undesirable, since in that case the hydrophobic microparticles 2 may in some instances not completely cover the surface of the flat-shaped microparticles 3, and the coating film 5 may not be imparted with the desired oil repellency. On the other hand, a mass ratio of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 to the flat-shaped microparticles 3 in excess of 5 is undesirable, since in this case, not only is the surface of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 covered by the hydrophobic microparticles 2, but also the uneven structure of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 becomes buried by the hydrophobic microparticles, all of which may preclude the desired oil repellency being imparted to the coating film 5. The mass ratio of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 to the binder resin 4 in the coating film 5 (mass of the flat-shaped microparticles 3/mass of the binder resin 4) is 0.25 or greater, and ranges preferably from 0.25 to 12, and more preferably from 0.5 to 8. Irregularities are formed on the surface of the coating film 5 by virtue of the presence of the flat-shaped microparticles 3. The water repellency of the coating film 5 can be increased by that uneven structure on the surface. A mass ratio of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 to the binder resin 4 smaller than 0.25 is undesirable, since in that case the flat-shaped microparticles 3 may in some instances not be dispersed throughout the coating film 5, which may preclude a coating film 5 with desired water repellency being obtained. On the other hand, a mass ratio of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 to the binder resin 4 in excess of 12 is undesirable since the amount of binder resin 4 is then excessively small, and, as a result, a coating film 5 with desired strength may in some instances not be obtained, and the coating film 5 may peel off the base material 1. The average particle size of the primary particles or secondary particles of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 is preferably 100 nm or smaller, and ranges more preferably from 5 nm to 100 nm, most preferably from 10 nm to 50 nm. An average particle size of the primary particles or secondary particles of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 in excess of 100 nm is undesirable since, in that case, the irregularities on the surface of the coating film 5 become excessively large, the proportion of the liquid-gas contact surface area on the surface of the coating film 5 does not decrease, and a coating film 5 with desired water repellency may not be obtained. When the irregularities on the surface of the coating film 5 are excessively large, the surface shape of the coating film 5 may change, due to external physical stimuli (for instance, collision with foreign matter, friction and the like), and water repellency may thus be impaired. On the other hand, an average particle size of the primary particles or secondary particles of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 smaller than 5 nm is undesirable since, in that case, the hydrophobic microparticles 2 aggregate readily, the fluidity of the coating composition decreases, and it may be difficult to coat the base material 1 with the coating composition. In the present invention, the average particle size of primary particles or secondary particles of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 is a value measured in accordance with a dynamic light scattering method. Methods for hydrophobizing microparticle surfaces can be resorted to herein without particular limitations, so long as the method allows imparting hydrophobicity to microparticle surfaces. Preferably, for instance, fluorine or an alkyl group is incorporated in the surface. Methods for incorporating fluorine or an alkyl group into microparticle surfaces include, for instance, methods where organometallic compounds are utilized, for instance silylating agents, silane coupling agents or alkyl aluminum. The silylating agent herein is a compound that causes for instance alkyl groups, allyl groups and fluorine-containing fluoroalkyl groups to bond with hydrolyzable silyl groups that have affinity or reactivity towards inorganic materials. Examples of hydrolyzable groups that bond with silicon include, for instance, alkoxy groups, halogens, acetoxy groups and the like. Ordinarily used herein are preferably alkoxy groups such as methoxy groups and ethoxy group, or chlorine. Examples include, for instance, trimethyl silylating agents, alkyl silanes, aryl silanes, fluoroalkyl silanes and the like. The hydrophobic microparticles 2 in the present invention are preferably silica having a hydrophobic surface. As used herein, the term “silica” does not refer strictly to silica in an SiO2 state, and also encompasses silicon oxides. Silica having a hydrophobic surface includes, for instance, one obtained by subjecting the surface of silica to a hydrophobizing treatment. In other words, as the hydrophobic microparticles 2, silica having a hydrophobic surface, which is obtained by subjecting hydrophilic silica to a hydrophobizing treatment may be used. The hydrophobic microparticles 2 used in the coating composition of the present invention can be commercially obtained under the product names “Aerosil 200” (by Nippon Aerosil Co. Ltd.), “Aerosil 300” (by Nippon Aerosil Co. Ltd.), “Aerosil 380” (by Nippon Aerosil Co. Ltd.), “Aerosil 90G” (by Nippon Aerosil Co. Ltd.), “Aerosil OX50” (by Nippon Aerosil Co. Ltd.), “Aerosil R972” (by Nippon Aerosil Co. Ltd.), “Aerosil 972V” (by Nippon Aerosil Co. Ltd.), “Aerosil R972CF” (by Nippon Aerosil Co. Ltd.), “Aerosil R974” (by Nippon Aerosil Co.

Ltd.), “WACKER HDK H18” (by Wacker Asahikasei Silicone Co. Ltd.), “WACKER HDK H20” (by Wacker Asahikasei Silicone Co. Ltd.), “WACKER HDK H30” (by Wacker Asahikasei Silicone Co. Ltd.), “Reolosil HM20S” (by Tokuyama Corporation), “Reolosil HM30S” (by Tokuyama Corporation), “Reolosil HM40S” (by Tokuyama Corporation), “Reolosil ZD30S” (by Tokuyama Corporation), “Reolosil DM30S” (by Tokuyama Corporation) and the like. The flat-shaped microparticles 3 in the present invention are for instance plate-like, flake-like, stripe-like or disc-like microparticles, such that, preferably, the aspect ratio between the table faces and the end faces of the microparticles is 10 or higher. An aspect ratio of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 lower than 10 is undesirable, since in that case the shape of the microparticles is close to a needle-like or rod-like shape and a card-house aggregate structure is not formed readily, so that a coating film 5 with desired water repellency may not be obtained. The average particle size of the primary particles of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 ranges preferably from 100 nm to 100 μm, more preferably from 100 nm to 10 μm, and most preferably from 200 nm to 3 μm. As used herein, the term particle size of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 denotes the length in the longitudinal direction of the particles. An average particle size of the primary particles of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 smaller than 100 nm is undesirable since the required uneven structure for enhancing water repellency may not be obtained in such cases. An average particle size of the primary particles of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 in excess of 100 μm becomes undesirable since in that case the spacing between flat-shaped microparticles 3 is excessively larger than droplets, and a coating film 5 with desired water repellency may not be obtained. In the present invention, the average particle size of primary particles of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 is a value measured in accordance with a dynamic light scattering method. The average particle size of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 in an aggregated state ranges preferably from 125 nm to 200 μm, and more preferably from 10 μm to 100 μm. An average particle size of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 in an aggregated state smaller than 125 nm is undesirable since, in that case, the difference from the fine uneven structure formed by the hydrophobic microparticles 2 decreases, and, as a result, the enhancing effect on water repellency elicited by a combination of uneven structures may in some instances not be achieved. An average particle size of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 in an aggregated state in excess of 200 μm is undesirable since, in that case, the adhesiveness of the binder resin 4 decreases, the surface shape of the coating film 5 may change due to external stimuli, and water repellency may thus be impaired. Examples of the flat-shaped microparticles 3 that form a card-house structure include, for instance, smectite, tobermorite, bentonite, kaolin, mica, boehmite, aluminum, alumina, silica, calcium silicate, calcium carbonate, silicate minerals, alumina, silica, calcium carbonate, boron nitride, graphene, titanium oxide, hydroxide compounds, carbonate compounds, phosphate compounds, silicate compounds, titanate compounds and the like. The flat-shaped microparticles 3 can be commercially obtained, for instance under the product names “Tobermorite TJ” (by Japan Insulation Co. Ltd.), “Serashuru BMF” (by Kawai Lime Industry Co. Ltd.); “Serashuru BMM” (by Kawai Lime Industry Co. Ltd.); “Serashuru BMT” (by Kawai Lime Industry Co. Ltd.); “Serashuru BMN” (by Kawai Lime Industry Co. Ltd.); “Sunlovery” (by AGC SI-Tech Co. Ltd.), “Sunlovery” (by AGC SI-Tech Co. Ltd.), “TERRACESS” (by Otsuka Chemical Co. Ltd.), “Aluminum paste” (by Toyo Aluminum Co. Ltd.); “Serath” (by Kinsei Matec Co. Ltd.), “Silky flake” (by Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd.), “Glass flake” (by Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd.), “Micro mica” (by Co-op Chemical Co. Ltd.), “Somasif” (by Co-op Chemical Co. Ltd.), “Lucentite” (by Co-op Chemical Co. Ltd.), “SBN” (by Showa Denko Co. Ltd.), “Denka boron nitride” (by Denki Kagaku Kogyo Co. Ltd.), “PS35-A” (by New Lime Co. Ltd.), and “PS15-A” (by New Lime Co. Ltd.). The binder resin 4 is not particularly limited, so long as it is a solvent-soluble binder, and known resins in this technical field can be used. Examples of the binder resin 4 preferably used in the present invention include, for instance, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and fluoroolefin copolymers. Examples of monomer components that yield fluoroolefin copolymers include, for instance, chlorotrifluoroethylene, tetrafluoroethylene, and vinyl esters having various substituents. Both polar organic solvents and non-polar organic solvents can be used as the solvent that is used in the coating composition of the present invention. Examples of solvents preferably used in the present invention include, for instance, fluorine-based solvents, chlorine-based solvents, aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene and xylene, aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, ester solvents such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate, ketones such as methyl isobutyl ketone and acetone, as well as ether solvents. Known additives such as dispersants, leveling agents, evaporation inhibitors, adhesion modifiers and the like may be added to the coating composition of the present invention in amounts such that the effect of the invention is not impaired. The coating film 5 can be formed by applying the coating composition described above onto a base material 1, and drying it. The coating method of the coating composition is not particularly limited, and any known method in the technical field in question may be resorted to. Examples of coating methods include, for instance, spray coating, dip coating and the like. The drying conditions are not particularly limited, and may be adjusted, as appropriate, in accordance with, for instance, the composition of the coating composition. The base material 1 on which the coating film 5 is formed is not particularly limited, and can be selected, as appropriate, in accordance with the type of article in which a water-repellent member is to be used. Examples of the base material 1 include, for instance, metal substrates such as aluminum substrates, stainless steel substrates and the like, as well as glass substrates and plastic substrates. Next, a method for producing the coating composition of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 6 to FIG. 8. The coating composition of the present invention is obtained in accordance with a production method that involves mixing the solvent 6, the binder resin 4 and the hydrophobic microparticles 2, subjecting the resulting mixture to a dispersing treatment to yield a dispersion, and thereafter, adding the flat-shaped microparticles 3 that form a card-house aggregate structure, to the dispersion. FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram for explaining the state of the mixed solution obtained by mixing the binder resin 4, dissolved in the solvent 6, and the hydrophobic microparticles 2. In this mixed solution, most of the hydrophobic microparticles 2 are dispersed in the form of secondary particles. FIG. 7 is a schematic diagram for explaining the state of the dispersion that is obtained by subjecting the mixed solution illustrated in FIG. 6 to a dispersing treatment. In this dispersion, the hydrophobic microparticles 2 are homogeneously dispersed in the form of primary particles. FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram for explaining the state of a coating composition that is obtained by adding the flat-shaped microparticles 3 that form a card-house aggregate structure, to the dispersion illustrated in FIG. 7. In the present invention, the hydrophobic microparticles 2 are preferably dispersed in an organic solvent, through the effect of cavitation, in order for the hydrophobic microparticles 2 to be dispersed homogeneously. The cavitation effect is herein a phenomenon whereby bubbles are generated, through vaporization of local low-pressure portions, in a liquid that is flowing at high speed. Cavitation can be achieved, for instance, by adding the hydrophobic microparticles 2 to an organic solvent, and then dispersing the hydrophobic microparticles 2 by applying a pressure of about 10 MPa to 400 MPa, using high a high-pressure wet atomization apparatus. In the present invention, the flat-shaped microparticles 3 forming a card-house aggregate structure are preferably dispersed, in an organic solvent, in accordance with a method in which no strong shear forces are exerted. Such dispersion can be achieved, for instance, by adding the flat-shaped microparticles 3 that form a card-house aggregate structure, to an organic solvent, followed by dispersion using a shaker or the like. If strong shear forces are exerted, the card-house aggregate structure breaks down, which precludes obtaining the desired water repellency. EXAMPLES The present invention will be explained in detail below with reference to examples, but the present invention is not limited to these examples, and can accommodate various applications without departing from the technical scope of the invention. Measurements and evaluations in the examples and comparative examples were conducted in accordance with the methods described below. <Evaluation of Superhydrophobicity> The initial contact angle with a water droplet was measured, as described below, in order to evaluate superhydrophobicity.
