DESCRIPTION DEVICE FOR REMOVING AN ACETABULAR CUP Technical Field In the orthopaedic field, there is increasingly a need for surgery to solve musculoskeletal apparatus disorders. In particular, there has been a great focus on curing diseases that can lead to motor difficulties for the patient such as, for example, deterioration of the hip joint. In fact, following diseases or simple deterioration due to the passing of time, the cartilaginous part of the hip joint can be consumed leading to contact between two bone surfaces that can generate pain. In this case, through surgery the diseased joint is replaced by inserting foreign parts to the skeletal structure able to effectively replace the original bone structures and perform their task. In the case of hip prostheses, the head of the femur and the acetabular cup are replaced through similar shaped implants and having similar tasks that are guaranteed to the patient's surrounding bone structure. However, it is known that in the state of the art, said prostheses have an effective life that can rarely accompany the patient for their entire lifetime, especially if the patient has not undergone surgery at an advanced age. Therefore, when the prostheses are worn, they must be surgically replaced. Said surgical operation usually envisages the removal of the acetabular cup and its replacement. Since said acetabular cup of the first implant is solidly joined to the patient's bone structure, said acetabular cup must be removed using suitable removal devices. For that purpose removal instruments have been designed that can help the surgeon with this task. An example of what is known in the state of the art is the device disclosed by document US6565575 by Zimmer, inc. Said known device substantially has a central, almost rectilinear and elongated, shape, having two ends, to one of which a handle is connected transversal thereto, while at the other there are connection means adapted to detachably connect a hemisphere and a blade. While removing the acetabular cup the hemisphere is inserted into said acetabular cup so that the blade of the device is forced to penetrate between the external part of the acetabular cup and the patient's bone structure. To proceed with said insertion, the surgeon must place the instrument in a position such that the end on which the hemisphere and blade are provided penetrates into the cut made in the patient. Such a position will hence be angled as little as possible with respect to the patient's body, so as to approach the acetabular site as frontally as possible in order to make the hemisphere line up with the acetabular cup to be removed. This technique brings the central body of the instrument disclosed by US6565575 towards the patient's wound, potentially coming into contact with it. Hence, by acting on the transverse handle to the central body, the surgeon imposes a rotation on the instrument and, therefore, causes the blade to rotate about the external perimeter of the implanted acetabular cup, separating it from the bone and allowing its removal. This procedure naturally also places in rotation the central body of the instrument which, being in the immediate vicinity of the wound, can cause interference making it rather difficult for the surgeon to operate said rotation freely. Hence, it is necessary, in order to minimise contact between the instrument and the patient's body as much as possible, for the surgeon to work with great caution. Furthermore, it not being possible to perform a complete revolution of the instrument about its axis in order to completely detach the acetabular cup from its site, it is necessary to remove the instrument from the wound and reposition it so as to proceed with the necessary resection operations. As can be easily understood, according to the size of the patient, the dimensions of the implanted acetabular cup(s) will vary and, still as a consequence of that, the dimensions of the hemisphere coupled thereto during its removal steps will also have to vary. In order to provide an instrument that is as suitable as possible for the characteristic dimensions of the acetabular cup to be removed, document US6565575 provides a device for removing an acetabular cup wherein both the hemispherical head and the blade can be removed and changed according to the size of the acetabular cup to be removed. Another example of what is known in the state of the art is illustrated in document US7998146 by Innomed inc. In said document a device is disclosed having a substantially similar shape to that described in document US6565575, also having a removable hemispherical head, interchangeable according to the size of the acetabular cup to be replaced and a fixed blade for the removal of the acetabular cup. However, what is known in the state of the art has some disadvantages. A disadvantage of what is known in the state of the art, as previously mentioned, is the difficulty to manoeuvre known devices during operations that imply minimally invasive techniques. In fact, during such surgical operations the aim is to operate on the patient making cuts in the tissues that are as small as possible. Hence, it appears clear that a device such as those known in the state of the art forces the surgeon, during acetabular cup removal operations, to manoeuvre in quite restricted spaces with the risk of bringing said known instrument into contact with the patient's soft tissues. Not only, but another disadvantage presented by what is known in the state of the art is the objective difficulty to make the blade intended for the removal of the acetabular cup perform the necessary revolution movement, in order to completely detach the said cup from its position. In fact, still due to the reduced movement possibilities imposed by the minimally invasive surgical techniques, in order to perform a complete revolution of the device about its axis, the surgeon is forced to manoeuvre the said instrument outside the wound or to perform the movements with great caution should they be performed within the surgical site provided in the patient's body, in order to prevent contact between the soft tissues and the known device as far as possible, said contact being able to cause damage to the patient. Therefore, during said operations the surgeon runs the risk of having to make a larger cut in order to have sufficient manoeuvring space with the consequent unnecessary cutting of the patient's soft tissues. Furthermore, during said acetabular cup removal operations, there may be a risk of inadvertently inflicting small traumas to the tissues surrounding the acetabulum. It is also common surgical experience that during surgery of this kind, it is not at all easy to insert the necessary instrumentation into the patient's body, especially when it requires precise alignment with the bone structure. In fact, the presence of soft tissues, fat and bleeding tissues makes it particularly difficult for the surgeon to correctly identify the correct site for placement of the necessary instrumentation. This, inevitably, causes stress and fatigue for the surgeon and extends the time required for the operation with the resulting increased risks for the patient's health and higher costs for the health facilities. The above listed disadvantages, due to the conformation of what is known in the state of the art, complicate, as mentioned, the surgical operations, imposing long and unnecessary surgical times, with the consequent inconveniences for patients, the hospital facility and the surgeons. These related disadvantages imply higher costs and lower effectiveness in implementing the operations. Starting from the notion of these disadvantages, the present invention intends to provide a remedy for them. An aim of the present invention is to provide a device for removing an acetabular cup that can be used during minimally invasive surgical operations. Another aim of the present invention is to provide a device for removing an acetabular cup that prevents, as far as possible, contact with the soft tissues surrounding the surgical site. A further aim of the present invention is to provide a device for removing an acetabular cup that can facilitate the surgical operations preventing unnecessary movements when the device according to the present invention is placed in the patient's body. Yet another aim of the present invention is to provide a device as specified that makes the acetabular cup removal operations quicker. It will also be an aim of the present invention to provide a device for removing an acetabular cup that is comfortable to use, easy to make and has contained dimensions and reduced costs. In view of such aims, the present invention provides a device for removing an acetabular cup, whose fundamental characteristic is the subject matter of claim 1 . Further advantageous characteristics will be clear in the dependent claims. All the claims are to be understood as here stated in full. The present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, with reference to the appended drawings provided merely by way of example, wherein: figure 1 is a side elevation view of the device for removing an acetabular cup, figure 2 is a detailed view of detail A of Figure 1 , figure 3 is a sectional view of figure 2 according to section line ll-ll. In the drawing, 100 indicates, as a whole, a device for removing an acetabular cup according to the present invention. Said device 100 for removing an acetabular cup comprises: a central body 10, having an elongated substantially cylindrical section shape, made of rigid material, preferably metal or plastic, and having a first free end 10.1 and a second end 10.2 integrally connected to it. The said first free end 10.1 comprises a first handle 3, integrally and coaxially provided at said first free end 10.1 of the central body 10 and made of a material, for example metal or rubber, so as to provide a comfortable and safe grip for the user and a second handle 5, having a cylindrical shape, made of metal and/or plastic material and assembled on said first handle 3 transversally to the axis of the central body 10, so as to form a single body therewith. The free end 10.1 has, in its end part, an area with a larger section 4, known as an impact area, placed downstream of the first handle 3, made of shock- resistant material suitable for withstanding impulse stress of a notable intensity. The second end 10.2 has a cylindrical section and central axis not coinciding with the central axis of the central body 10. In a preferred embodiment illustrated in the drawing by mere way of example, the central axis of the central body 10 and the central axis of the second end 10.2 form an angle comprised between 0 and 90 degrees, for example 30 degrees. Naturally, said angle illustrated in the exemplificative figures does not preclude the possibility of making the said device 100 with different angulations, or, potentially, central coinciding axes, without however departing from the scope of protection of the present invention. Said second end 10.2 further comprises a ratchet device 7. Said ratchet device 7, represented in exploded view in figure 2, has a first toothed element 15, said toothed cup-shaped element having a substantially cylindrical and symmetrical shape with respect to its central axis 8, hollow inside and having toothing 15.1 frontally projecting from it. Said toothed cup-shaped element 15 is axially fitted onto a portion 9.2 of a shaft 9, coaxial thereto, and is free to turn idle on said portion 9.2 of the shaft 9. Furthermore, the toothed cup-shaped element 15 has a coupling area 15.5 adapted to make the said toothed cup-shaped element 15 integral with the second end 10.2 of the central body 10, for example by welding. In front of said toothed cup-shaped element 15 a second toothed element 1 1 is arranged, having a substantially cylindrical shape, complementary to the toothed cup-shaped element 15 and substantially symmetrical with respect to one of its central axes. The toothed element 1 1 comprises a central relief area 1 1 .3, having a substantially cylindrical shape, axially projecting from the toothed element 1 1 and of dimensions such as to be inserted in an axial cavity 15.3 provided in the toothed cup-shaped element 15. Said toothed element 1 1 is further partially fitted onto and integrally connected to a portion 9.1 of the shaft 9. Said portion 9.1 of the shaft 9 is positioned axially with respect to said toothed element 1 1 and is adapted to be coupled with respective portion 9.2 of the shaft 9 provided detachably couplable with the toothed cup-shaped element 15. A toothing 1 1 .1 is radially provided on the surface of the element 1 1 and axially projecting from it, facing the toothed cup-shaped element 15, and is made so as to be able to mesh in the toothing 15.1 of the toothed cup-shaped element 15. Between the toothed cup-shaped element 15 and the toothed element 1 1 , an elastic means 12 is interposed, for example a helical spring, housed within the axial cavity 15.2, fitted onto the shaft 9 and interposed between the bottom wall of said axial cavity 15.2 and the central relief area 1 1 .3. Note that, in the embodiment illustrated, the axial cavity 15.2 has a through hole in its bottom wall to house the shaft 9 onto which said helical spring 12 is fitted as can be seen in Figure 3. In the end part of the portion 9.2 of the shaft 9, an abutment 9.3 is provided to prevent the accidental withdrawal of the portion 9.2 of the shaft 9 from the toothed cup-shaped element 15. When the device is in the operating configuration, the two portions 9.1 and 9.2 of the shaft 9 are integrally coupled, for example, through a snap coupling. Note also that, as represented in the drawings provided merely by way of example and as described above, in order to optimise explanatory clarity, an embodiment has been illustrated wherein the shaft 9 is equipped, as mentioned, with two portions 9.1 and 9.2 adapted to be coupled to one another. Naturally, it will be possible to provide an embodiment wherein said shaft 9 is made of a single body, without departing from the scope of protection of the present invention. Note again that, in the embodiment presented by way of example in the drawings, the toothed cup-shaped element 15 and the toothed element 1 1 are coaxial but it appears immediately clear to a person skilled in the art how they could have axes that do not coincide, without departing from the protection claimed by the present invention. At the free end of the portion 9.1 of the shaft 9 a cutting element 6 is provided, for example a blade, and a stop element 13, for example a spherical or hemispherical head. The blade 6 is assembled on the portion 9.1 of the shaft 9, for example through a threaded coupling or through a fixing pin, and is able to rotate integrally with the shaft 9. Likewise, the head 13 is assembled integrally onto the portion 9.1 of the shaft 9 through, for example, a spring positioner. Operation During the steps for removing an acetabular cup through the anterior approach technique, the surgeon, having conveniently pre-treated the area around the acetabulum, inserts the device 100 for removing an acetabular cup according to the present invention into the patient's body. The conformation of the central body 10 is such that, when the surgeon grips the device 100 keeping the second handle 5 projecting from the opposite side of the central body 10 with respect to the patient, the only part of said device 100 that is in contact with the aforementioned patient's body comprises the ratchet 7, the head 13 and the blade 6. When the surgeon inserts the device 100 into the patient's body, the conformation of the central body 10 also allows the head 13 to be easily inserted into the acetabular cup to be removed. This takes place since the central axis of the central body 10 and the central axis 8 do not coincide. In fact, said non-coincidence between the aforementioned axes makes it possible to keep the central body 10 and, consequently, the handles 3 and 5, at a manoeuvring distance from the patient's body and to place in contact therewith only the parts of the device 100 strictly necessary for the removal of the acetabular cup. In fact, by inserting the head 13 in the acetabular cup to be removed, the blade 6 is located in the area pre- treated by the surgeon surrounding the said acetabular cup to be removed. At this point, by acting on the system of handles 3 and 5 provided at the first end 10.1 of the central body 10 and pushing said first end 10.1 towards the head 13 the toothed cup-shaped element 15 is meshed with the toothed element 1 1 . This meshing takes place thanks to the rigid structure presented by the central body 10 and its two ends 10.1 integral with the handles 3 and 5, and 10.2 integral with the toothed cup- shaped element 15, a rigid structure that transfers the pressure exerted by the surgeon on the toothed cup-shaped element 15, varying its configuration from a first position, known as the rest position, wherein said toothed cup-shaped element 15 is not meshed with the toothed element 1 1 , to a second position, known as the meshed position, wherein the toothed cup-shaped element 15 is meshed with the toothed element 1 1 . When the pressure made by the surgeon is transmitted to the toothed cup- shaped element 15 forcing it into the meshed position, said toothed cup- shaped element 15 transfers said pressure onto the spring 12, placing it in compression and controlling its deformation. Said deformation of the spring 12 makes it possible for the toothed cup-shaped element 15 to approach the toothed element 1 1 , hence bringing the toothing 15.1 to mesh with the toothing 1 1 .1 . Therefore, by acting for example on the handle 5 and placing it in rotation, for example, clockwise, the toothed cup-shaped element 15, being integral with the second end 10.2 of the central body 10, is made to rotate clockwise due to the toothed coupling with the toothed element 1 1 . Said toothed element 1 1 , placed in rotation, in turn, causes a similar rotation on the blade 6, it being integral with the said toothed element 1 1 through the portion 9.1 of the shaft 9. The rotation will be limited by the free rotation of the second end 10.2 before it comes into contact with the patient's soft tissues. When said end 10.2 almost reaches contact with the patient's said soft tissues, the surgeon removes the pressure exerted on the handle 5 and, consequently, transferred to the ratchet 7 through the central body 10 by means of its two ends 10.1 and 10.2. Said compression strain having been removed, the spring 12 no longer kept in the compressed configuration by said pressure, regains its neutral configuration by reciprocally moving the toothed cup-shaped element 15 away from the toothed element 1 1 , releasing the toothings 15.1 and 1 1 .1 from their meshed configuration illustrated above. At this point, the surgeon can, if further rotation of the blade 6 is required in order to extract the acetabular cup from its site in the patient's body, impose a rotation in the opposite direction to the one performed previously, for example in the anti-clockwise direction, bringing the handles 3 and 5 back to the initial configuration. Said counter rotation, as illustrated, does not have an effect on the position of the blade, keeping it in the position reached when the pressure on the handles is stopped. Note that the counter rotation imposed by the surgeon on the system of handles 3 and 5 will also have an effect on the second end 10.2, bringing it back into a position of non-interference with the soft tissues. At this point the surgeon will repeat the actions listed above to place the toothings 15.3 and 1 1 .3 provided on the toothed cup-shaped element 15 and the toothed element 1 1 , in contact again and, imposing a rotation, for example clockwise, along with a pressure, place the blade 6 in rotation. The above listed operations will be repeated until the acetabular cup to be removed has been completely taken out of its site. As appears clear from the above description, the present invention provides a device 100 for removing an acetabular cup that advantageously achieves the aforementioned aims. In fact, as is clear for a person skilled in the art, the device 100 for removing an acetabular cup can be used in minimally invasive surgery since the only part subject to insertion in the patient's body is the portion formed by the ratchet 7, the head 13 and the blade 6. Furthermore, after placement of said device 100 for removing an acetabular cup, it is possible for the surgeon to act on said instrument without touching the soft tissues with a part of the central body 10 and/or with a part of its second end 10.2 proximal to said central body 10. Unlike what is known in the state of the art, the blade 6 can perform a complete revolution about the axis 8 visible in figure 1 without it being necessary to extract the device 100 to reposition the central body in order to prevent contact with the soft tissues, so as to have enough space to manoeuvre in order to act on the handles 3 and 5. Naturally numerous variants can be made to what is described and illustrated merely by way of non-limiting example, without for this reason departing from the protective scope of the present invention and therefore from the domain of the present industrial patent. 1 .
