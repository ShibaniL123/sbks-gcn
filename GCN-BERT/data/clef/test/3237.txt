GOVERNMENT FUNDING Some of the work described herein was done with government support under grant number K23 CA107040, awarded by the NIH/NCI. The government may have certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to methods for antagonizing the hedgehog pathway and for treating various conditions using cyclopamine analogs. Inhibition of the hedgehog pathway in certain cancers has been shown to result in inhibition of tumor growth. For example, anti-hedgehog antibodies have been shown to antagonize the function of the hedgehog pathway and inhibit the growth of tumors. Small molecule inhibition of hedgehog pathway activity has also been shown to result in cell death in a number of cancer types. Research in this area has focused primarily on the elucidation of hedgehog pathway biology and the discovery of new hedgehog pathway inhibitors. Although inhibitors of the hedgehog pathway have been identified, there still exists the need to identify more potent inhibitors of the hedgehog pathway. PCT publication WO 2006/026430 published 9 Mar. 2006 and assigned to the same assignee as the present application, discloses a wide variety of cyclopamine analogs, focusing on those with unsaturation in the A or B ring. In the present application, the surprisingly potent analogs contain completely saturated A and B rings.

It will be understood that “substitution” or “substituted with” includes the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., which does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The present invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, R- and S-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention. As set out above, certain embodiments of the present compounds may contain a basic functional group, such as amino or alkylamino, and are, thus, capable of forming pharmaceutically-acceptable salts with pharmaceutically-acceptable acids. The term “pharmaceutically-acceptable salts” in this respect, refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process, or by separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, napthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, and laurylsulphonate salts and the like. (See, for example, Berge, et al. “Pharmaceutical Salts”, J. Pharm. Sci. (1977) 66:1-19) The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention include the conventional nontoxic salts or quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds, e.g., from non-toxic organic or inorganic acids. For example, such conventional nontoxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric, and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, palmitic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicyclic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isothionic, and the like. In other cases, the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically-acceptable salts with pharmaceutically-acceptable bases. The term “pharmaceutically-acceptable salts” in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can likewise be prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically-acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically-acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine and the like. (See, for example, Berge, et al., supra) Synthesis of Steroidal Alkaloid Compounds The ring expanded steroidal alkaloid derivatives described above can be prepared directly from naturally occurring steroidal alkaloids or synthetic analogs thereof. In certain instances, the steroidal alkaloid starting materials can be cyclopamine or jervine. These steroidal alkaloids can be purchased commercially or extracted from Veratrum Californicum. Briefly, the process of the present invention comprises the steps of cyclopropanating suitable starting steroidal alkaloid derivatives followed by ring expansion rearrangement of the cyclopropyl derivatives. In some instances, it may be desirable to suitably protect or otherwise transform reactive functionalities present on the molecule prior to cyclopropanation. For example, an alcohol present at R1 and a secondary nitrogen present on the fused furano-piperidine ring can both be protected prior to cyclopropanation. In certain embodiments, protecting groups that are efficiently added and removed from the alkaloid, yield intermediates in the synthetic process with improved handling properties and which allow for the efficient purification of the synthetic intermediates formed may be preferred. Examples of oxygen protecting groups include, but are not limited to formate, acetate, chloroacetate, dichloroacetate, trichloroacetate, pivaloate, benzoates, alkyl carbonate, alkenyl carbonate, aryl carbonates, aralkyl carbonate (e.g., benzyl carbonate), 2,2,2-trichloroethyl carbonate, alkoxymethyl ether, aralkoxymethyl ether, alkylthiomethl ether, aralkylthio ether, arylthio ether, trialkylsilyl ether, alkylarylsilyl ether, benzyl ether, arylmethyl ether, and allyl ether. Examples of nitrogen protecting groups include, but are not limited to formyl, chloroacetyl, trichloroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, phenyl acetyl, benzoyls, benzamides, alkyl carbamates, aralkyl carbamates (e.g., benzyl carbamates), aryl carbamates, allyl, aralkyl, alkoxymethyl, aralkoxymethyl, N-2-cyanoethyl, diarylphosphinamides, dialkylphosphinamidates, diarylphosphinamidates, and trialkylsilyl. Additional protecting groups that may be used in the methods of the present invention are described in Green, T. W.; Wuts, P. G., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1999. A variety of cyclopropanating agents can be used to cyclopropanate the steroidal alkaloid. 1,1-haloalkylmetal complexes and reactive species referred to as carbenoids, are commonly used to cyclopropanate olefins. These reagents are typically made using a diiodoalkane or diazoalkane and a metal or organometalic species such as Et2Zn, iBu3Al, samarium, copper, rhodium, or palladium. In certain embodiments, Et2Zn and diiodomethane are used to generate the 1,1-haloalkylmetal species. The reactivity and the ease of handling of the 1,1-haloalkylzinc complexes can be modified by the addition of certain reagents, such as acids. It is believed that the addition of an acid to the 1,1-haloalkylzinc species generates an alkyl zinc mixed salt. In the examples described below a biarylphosphoric acid is combined with diiodomethane and diethylzinc to generate a putative haloalkyl zinc phosphate cyclopropanating agent. A variety of phosphoric acids can be used to generate the putative haloalkylzinc phosphate. Other known cyclopropanation methods such as those utilizing sulfur ylides to react with an olefin conjugated to a carbonyl to add a CH2 or CH-alkyl or CH-aryl group, and metal-catalyzed decomposition of diazoalkyl and α-diazo-carbonyl compounds, such as diazomethane and ethyl diazoacetate, can also be used: these methods readily provide cyclopropanes having alkyl, aryl, alkoxycarbonyl (—COOR), or acyl substituents. Additional cyclopropanating agents are described in Masalov, et al., Organic Letters (2004) 6:2365-2368 and Hansen, et al., Chem. Comm. (2006) 4838-4840. The cyclopropyl ring may be substituted or unsubstituted. In cases where the cyclopropyl ring is substituted, the groups attached to the methylene of the cyclopropane will be installed onto the D ring after rearrangement and ring expansion. The cyclopropanation reactions may be conducted in an aprotic solvent. Suitable solvents include ethers, such as diethyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, diglyme, t-butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and the like; halogenated solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, and the like; aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, such as benzene, xylene, toluene, hexane, pentane and the like; esters and ketones, such as ethyl acetate, acetone, and 2-butanone; polar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and the like; or combinations of two or more solvents. In a certain embodiments, dichloromethane is the solvent used for the cyclopropanation when a dialkyl zinc and diiodomethane is used. In the examples described below, a solution containing the cyclopropanating agent is prepared by first adding a solution of a phosphoric acid to a solution of diethyl zinc, followed by addition of diiodomethane to the reaction solution. The cyclopropanation substrate is then added to this solution. Alternatively, the cyclopropanation agent can be prepared in the presence of the cyclopropanation substrate by changing the order of addition of the reagents. In certain embodiments, the cyclopropanation reaction is conducted by first adding the phosphoric acid to a solution of dialkylzinc, followed by the addition of the cyclopropanation substrate, and finally the dihaloalkane is added. Using this method the cyclopropanating agent is generated under controlled conditions and immediately reacts with the cyclopropanation substrate. Following synthesis of the cyclopropanated steroidal alkaloid core, the compound may be derivatized using a variety of functionalization reactions known in the art. Representative examples include palladium coupling reactions to alkenylhalides or aryl halides, oxidations, reductions, reactions with nucleophiles, reactions with electrophiles, pericyclic reactions, radical reactions, installation of protecting groups, removal of protecting groups, and the like. In the presence of Lewis or Brønsted acids the cyclopropyl analogs undergo a rearrangement and ring expansion to afford steroidal alkaloid analogs in which the D ring has been expanded by one carbon. The cyclopropanation and ring expansion can take place in a two-step one reaction vessel process or in a two-step two reaction vessel process. When the cyclopropanation and ring expansion are conducted in the same reaction vessel the acid used to initiate the ring expansion rearrangement is added after completion of the cyclopropanation reaction. Under certain conditions, the zinc salts that are generated in the course of cyclopropanating the steroidal alkaloid can themselves act as Lewis acids to catalyze the ring expansion rearrangement. The reactivity of the zinc salts generated after the cyclopropanation can be modified by the addition of acids to generate more active Lewis acids. As described below in the examples section, the methanesulfonic acid is added to the cyclopropanation reaction vessel after completion of the cyclopropanation. Additional examples of suitable acids include, but are not limited to zinc salts, boron compounds, magnesium salts, titanium salts, indium salts, aluminum salts, tin salts, lanthanum salts, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, diaryloxyphosporic acids, acetic acid, and HCl. In a certain embodiments of the invention the Lewis acid used is a zinc salt or BF3. These ring expanded analogs may be further functionalized using a variety of functionalization reactions known in the art. Representative examples include palladium coupling reactions to alkenylhalides or aryl halides, oxidations, reductions, reactions with nucleophiles, reactions with electrophiles, pericyclic reactions, radical reactions, installation of protecting groups, removal of protecting groups, and the like.

Methods of Treatment Hedgehog signaling is essential in many stages of development, especially in formation of left-right symmetry. Loss or reduction of hedgehog signaling leads to multiple developmental deficits and malformations, one of the most striking of which is cyclopia. Many tumors and proliferative conditions have been shown to depend on the hedgehog pathway. The growth of such cells and survival can be affected by treatment with the compounds disclosed herein. Recently, it has been reported that activating hedgehog pathway mutations occur in sporadic basal cell carcinoma (Xie, et al., Nature (1998) 391:90-92) and primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (Reifenberger, et al., Cancer Res (1998) 58:1798-1803). Uncontrolled activation of the hedgehog pathway has also been shown in numerous cancer types such as GI tract cancers including pancreatic, esophageal, gastric cancer (Berman, et al., Nature (2003) 425:846-851, Thayer, et al., Nature (2003) 425:851-856) lung cancer (Watkins, et al., Nature (2003) 422:313-317, prostate cancer (Karhadkar, et al. Nature (2004) 431:707-712, Sheng, et al., Molecular Cancer (2004) 3:29-42, Fan, et al., Endocrinology (2004) 145:3961-3970), breast cancer (Kubo, et al., Cancer Research (2004) 64:6071-6074, Lewis, et al., Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia (2004) 2:165-181) and hepatocellular cancer (Sicklick, et al., ASCO conference (2005), Mohini, et al., AACR conference (2005)). For example, small molecule inhibition of the hedgehog pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of basal cell carcinoma (Williams, et al., PNAS (2003) 100:4616-4621), medulloblastoma (Berman, et al., Science (2002) 297:1559-1561), pancreatic cancer (Berman, et al., Nature (2003) 425:846-851), gastrointestinal cancers (Berman, et al., Nature (2003) 425:846-851, published PCT application WO 05/013800), esophageal cancer (Berman, et al., Nature (2003) 425:846-851), lung cancer (Watkins, et al., Nature (2003) 422:313-317), and prostate cancer (Karhadkar, et al., Nature (2004) 431:707-712). In addition, it has been shown that many cancer types have uncontrolled activation of the hedgehog pathway, for example, breast cancer (Kubo, et al., Cancer Research (2004) 64:6071-6074), heptacellular cancer (Patil, et al., 96th Annual AACR conference, abstract #2942 (2005); Sicklick, et al., ASCO annual meeting, abstract #9610 (2005)), hematological malignancies (Watkins and Matsui, unpublished results), basal carcinoma (Bale & Yu, Human Molec. Genet. (2001) 10:757-762, Xie, et al., Nature (1998) 391:90-92), medulloblastoma (Pietsch, et al., Cancer Res. (1997) 57:2085-2088), and gastric cancer (Ma, et al., Carcinogenesis, May 19, 2005 (Epub) (2005)). In addition, investigators have found that small molecule inhibition of the hedgehog pathway has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of psoriasis (Tas, et al., Dermatology (2004) 209:126-131). As shown in the Examples, the compounds disclosed herein have been shown to modulate the hedgehog pathway, and selected compounds have been shown to inhibit tumor growth. It is therefore believed that these compounds can be useful to treat a variety of hyperproliferative disorders, such as various cancers. Proliferative disorders that can be treated using the methods disclosed herein include: lung cancer (including small cell lung cancer and non small cell lung cancer), other cancers of the pulmonary system, medulloblastoma and other brain cancers, pancreatic cancer, basal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer and other genitourinary cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, cancers of the hematopoietic system (including multiple myeloma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome), polycythemia Vera, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, heavy chain disease, soft-tissue sarcomas, such as fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and other skin cancers, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, stadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, testicular cancer, bladder carcinoma, and other genitourinary cancers, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, endometrial cancer, follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, thyroid cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, small cell cancers, essential thrombocythemia, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, familiar hypereosinophilia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, thyroid cancer, neuroendocrine cancers, and carcinoid tumors. Additional disorders include Gorlin's syndrome and psoriasis The subject receiving this treatment is any animal in need, including primates, in particular humans, and other mammals such as equines, cattle, swine and sheep; and poultry and pets in general. The hedgehog inhibitors disclosed herein can be combined with other cancer treatments. For example, they can be combined with surgical treatments; radiation; biotherapeutics (such as interferons, cytokines—e.g., Interferon α, Interferon γ, and tumor necrosis factor, hematopoietic growth factors, monoclonal serotherapy, vaccines and immunostimulants); antibodies (e.g., Avastin, Erbitux, Rituxan, and Bexxar); endocrine therapy (including peptide hormones, corticosteroids, estrogens, androgens and aromatase inhibitors); anti-estrogens (e.g., Tamoxifen, Raloxifene, and Megestrol); LHRH agonists (e.g., goscrclin and Leuprolide acetate); anti-androgens (e.g., flutamide and Bicalutamide); gene therapy; bone marrow transplantation; photodynamic therapies (e.g., vertoporfin (BPD-MA), Phthalocyanine, photosensitizer Pc4, and Demethoxy-hypocrellin A (2BA-2-DMHA)); and chemotherapeutics. Examples of chemotherapeutics include gemcitabine, methotrexate, taxol, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, hydroxyurea, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, Ifosfamide, nitrosoureas, cisplatin, carboplatin, mitomycin, dacarbazine, procarbizine, etoposides, prednisolone, dexamethasone, cytarbine, campathecins, bleomycin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, daunorubicin, dactinomycin, plicamycin, mitoxantrone, asparaginase, vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine. Additional agents include nitrogen mustards (e.g., cyclophosphamide, Ifosfamide, Trofosfamide, Chlorambucil, Estramustine, and Melphalan), nitrosoureas (e.g., carmustine (BCNU) and Lomustine (CCNU)), alkylsulphonates (e.g., busulfan and Treosulfan), triazenes (e.g., Dacarbazine and Temozolomide), platinum containing compounds (e.g., Cisplatin, Carboplatin, and oxaliplatin), vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine, Vinblastine, Vindesine, and Vinorelbine), taxoids (e.g., paclitaxel and Docetaxol), epipodophyllins (e.g., etoposide, Teniposide, Topotecan, 9-Aminocamptothecin, Camptoirinotecan, Crisnatol, Mytomycin C, and Mytomycin C), anti-metabolites, DHFR inhibitors (e.g., methotrexate and Trimetrexate), IMP dehydrogenase Inhibitors (e.g., mycophenolic acid, Tiazofurin, Ribavirin, and EICAR), ribonuclotide reductase Inhibitors (e.g., hydroxyurea and Deferoxamine), uracil analogs (e.g., Fluorouracil, Floxuridine, Doxifluridine, Ratitrexed, and Capecitabine), cytosine analogs (e.g., cytarabine (ara C), Cytosine arabinoside, and Fludarabine), purine analogs (e.g., mercaptopurine and Thioguanine), Vitamin D3 analogs (e.g., EB 1089, CB 1093, and KH 1060), isoprenylation inhibitors (e.g., Lovastatin), dopaminergic neurotoxins (e.g., 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion), cell cycle inhibitors (e.g., staurosporine), actinomycins (e.g., Actinomycin D and Dactinomycin), bleomycins (e.g., bleomycin A2, Bleomycin B2, and Peplomycin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin, Doxorubicin (adriamycin), Idarubicin, Epirubicin, Pirarubicin, Zorubicin, and Mitoxantrone), MDR inhibitors (e.g., verapamil), Ca2+ ATPase inhibitors (e.g., thapsigargin), imatinib, thalidomide, lenalidomide, erlotinib, gefitinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, and proteasome inhibitors, including bortezomib. When the hedgehog inhibitors disclosed herein are administered in combination with other treatments, such as additional therapeutics or with radiation or surgery, the doses of each agent or therapy will in most instances be lower than the corresponding dose for single-agent therapy. Also, in general, the hedgehog inhibitors described herein and the second therapeutic agent do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, be administered by different routes. For example, one compound can be administered orally, while the second therapeutic is administered intravenously. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician. The hedgehog inhibitor and the second therapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially (i.e., one followed by the other, with an optional time interval in between), depending upon the nature of the proliferative disease, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of second therapeutic agent and/or radiation to be administered. If the hedgehog inhibitor, and the second therapeutic agent and/or radiation are not administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, then the optimum order of administration may be different for different conditions. Thus, in certain situations the hedgehog inhibitor may be administered first followed by the administration of the second therapeutic agent and/or radiation; and in other situations the second therapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered first followed by the administration of a hedgehog inhibitor. This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient. For example, the second therapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered first, especially if it is a cytotoxic agent, and then the treatment continued with the administration of a hedgehog inhibitor followed, where determined advantageous, by the administration of the second therapeutic agent and/or radiation, and so on until the treatment protocol is complete. EXEMPLIFICATION The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are included merely for purposes of illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the invention. Example 1 Step A Recrystallized cyclopamine 2 (14.1 g, 34.0 mmol, 1 eq) is dissolved in anhydrous DCM (70 mL) and anhydrous MeOH (29 mL). The clear solution is cooled, and triethylamine (10.4 g, 102.7 mmol, 3 eq) followed by benzyl chloroformate (6.20 g, 36.3 mmol, 1.1 eq) is added. After the addition is complete, the solution is stirred in the ice bath for 30 min. Three portions of benzyl chloroformate (3×0.35 g, 3.46 mmol, 0.03 eq) are added over the 3 h. The reaction is slowly quenched with water (71 mL), while maintaining the temperature below 20° C. The mixture is stirred for 15 min before the layers are settled and separated. The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The combined filtrate is buffered with anhydrous pyridine (30 mL), concentrated, and solvent exchanged with additional anhydrous pyridine (43 mL) and concentrated. The solution of the compound in pyridine (43 mL) is further diluted with additional anhydrous pyridine (85 mL). Trimethylacetyl chloride (8.3 g, 68.7 mmol, 2 eq) is added slowly to the reaction mixture, and the reaction is heated to 45° C. The reaction is stirred at 45° C. for 30 min. The reaction is cooled and quenched by the addition of anhydrous MeOH (4.5 mL). The quenched reaction mixture is stirred at rt for 40 min and then diluted with toluene (97 mL) and is treated sequentially with water (35 mL) and a 10 wt % aqueous sodium carbonate solution (100 mL). After vigorous stirring, the layers are separated and the organic layer is washed twice with water (2×100 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered. The filter cake is rinsed with toluene (49 mL) and discarded. The combined filtrates are concentrated, and solvent exchanged with concentration to toluene (145 mL) and further concentrating to dryness. The product is recrystallized from toluene and heptane. The crystalline product is isolated by suction filtration, washed with cold heptane and dried to a constant weight to afford 15.1 g of the desired product. Step B Bis(2,6-dimethyphenyl)phosphate (10.65 g, 34.8 mmol, 3.1 eq) is dried by concentration from anhydrous DCM (42 mL) and held under a nitrogen atmosphere. The phosphate is then redissolved in anhydrous DCM (110 mL). In a separate flask, a solution of neat diethylzinc (4.17 g, 33.8 mmol, 3.0 eq) in anhydrous DCM (35 mL) is prepared and cooled to −25° C. The phosphate solution is slowly transferred to the vessel containing the diethylzinc solution over 1 h, maintaining the temperature at or below −10° C. The clear ethylzinc phosphate solution is warmed to 0° C. and stirred for 15 min. Diiodomethane (9.25 g, 34.5 mmoles, 3.0 eq) is slowly added to the ethylzinc phosphate solution, maintaining the reaction temperature between 0 and 5° C. After the addition is complete, the zinc carbenoid solution is stirred for an additional 20 min. In a separate flask, compound 3 (7.20 g, 11.4 mmol, 1 eq) is dissolved in anhydrous DCM (36 mL) and transferred to the reaction flask. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to rt. After 6 h the contents of the flask are cooled to −53° C. A solution of methanesulfonic acid (3.38 g, 35.2 mmol, 3.1 eq) in anhydrous DCM (3 mL) is added, maintaining the reaction temperature below −45° C. After 10 min morpholine (20 g, 230 mmol, 20 eq) is added to the reaction mixture, maintaining the reaction temperature below −40° C. The reaction is allowed to warm to rt overnight. The morpholine salts are removed by filtration and the filter cake rinsed with DCM (22 mL). The combined filtrates are washed with 2N aqueous hydrochloric acid (2×140 mL), 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate (140 mL), 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate (70 mL) and 5% aqueous sodium bisulfite (70 mL), and brine (144 mL). The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. Without going to dryness, the DCM solution is concentrated and solvent exchanged with methanol (280 mL). The suspension are chilled with an ice bath and stirred for 40 minutes: The solids are isolated by filtration, washed twice with cold methanol (2×25 mL), and dried to a constant weight to afford 5.94 g of the desired product. Step C In a round bottom flask, compound 4 (11.67 g, 18.1 mmol, 1 eq) and 20% palladium hydroxide on wet carbon (2.40 g, 1.71 mmol, 0.09 eq) are placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and diluted with EtOAc (115 mL) and toluene (60 mL). The solution is degassed with nitrogen (3×) with evacuation/purge cycles, and the process is repeated for hydrogen. The suspension is vigorously stirred at rt for 1.5 h. The hydrogen atmosphere is replaced with nitrogen. Ethylenediamine (0.57 g, 9.5 mmol, 0.52 eq) is added to the reaction, and the resulting mixture stirred for 20 min. The solution is filtered under nitrogen, and the filtrate is washed with a 2% (wt/wt) aqueous solution of ethylenediamine (125 mL) then water (130 mL), and then dried over sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The solids that remained are chased with toluene (2×55 mL) on the rotary evaporator and the resulting material used without further purification in the next step The material from the previous step is dissolved in anhydrous DCM (26 mL). The resulting clear solution is added to a 1 M solution of DIBAL in DCM (65 mL, 65 mmol, 3.6 eq) while maintaining the reaction temperature between ˜10 and −25° C. After 30 min the reaction is quenched with acetone (13 mL), maintaining the reaction temperature at or below 0° C. After stirring the quenched reaction mixture for 17 min, it is added in portions to a flask containing a cold, stirred solution of 20% (wt/wt) aqueous Rochelle salt (200 mL). The resulting gelatinous suspension is stirred at rt for 15 h. After stirring, the clean layers are separated and the aqueous layer back extracted with DCM (30 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with water (60 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and discarded.

Example 28 Inhibition of the Hedgehog Pathway in Cell Culture Hedgehog pathway specific cancer cell killing effects may be ascertained using the following assay. C3H10T1/2 cells differentiate into osteoblasts when contacted with the sonic hedgehog peptide (Shh-N). Upon differentiation; these osteoblasts produce high levels of alkaline phosphatase (AP) which can be measured in an enzymatic assay (Nakamura, et al., BBRC (1997) 237:465). Compounds that block the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 into osteoblasts (a Shh dependent event) can therefore be identified by a reduction in AP production (van der Horst, et al., Bone (2003) 33:899). The assay details are described below. The results approximate (EC50 for inhibition) of the differentiation assay is shown below in Table 1. Assay Protocol Cell Culture Mouse embryonic mesoderm fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 cells (obtained from ATCC) were cultured in Basal MEM Media (Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 ug/ml streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen) at 37° C. with 5% CO2 in air atmosphere. Alkaline Phosphatase Assay C3H10T1/2 cells were plated in 96 wells with a density of 8×103 cells/well. Cells were grown to confluence (72 hrs). After sonic Hedgehog (250 ng/ml), and/or compound treatment, the cells were lysed in 110 μL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.1% TritonX100), plates were sonicated and lysates spun through 0.2 μm PVDF plates (Corning). 40 μL of lysates was assayed for AP activity in alkaline buffer solution (Sigma) containing 1 mg/ml p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate. After incubating for 30 min at 37° C., the plates were read on an Envision plate reader at 405 nm. Total protein was quantified with a BCA protein assay kit from Pierce according to manufacturer's instructions. AP activity was normalized against total protein. Note that “A” indicates that the IC50 is less than 20 nM, “B” indicates that the IC50 is 20-100 nM, “C” indicates that the IC50 is >100 nM.

On day 42 post-tumor implant, the mice were randomized into two groups to receive either Vehicle (30% HPBCD) or Compound 42. Compound 42 was administered orally at 40 mg/kg/day. After receiving 25 daily doses, Compound 42 statistically reduced tumor volume growth by 40% when compared to the vehicle control (p=0.0309). At the end of the study, the tumors were harvested 4 hours post the last dose to evaluate an on target response by q-RT-PCR analysis of the HH pathway genes. Analysis of human Gli-1 resulted in no modulation. Analysis of murine Gli-1 mRNA levels resulted in a robust down-regulation in the Compound treated group, when compared to the Vehicle treated group. Inhibition of the hedgehog pathway in mouse cells, but not human tumor cells, indicates that one effect of the hedgehog inhibitor is to affect a tumor-stroma interaction. Example 30 Medulloblastoma Model The activity of Compound 42 was also evaluated in a transgenic mouse model of medulloblastoma. Mice that are heterozygous for loss of function mutations in the tumor suppressors Patched1 (Ptch1) and Hypermethylated in Cancer (Hic1) develop spontaneous medulloblastoma. Similar to human medulloblastoma, these tumors demonstrate complete promoter hypermethylation of the remaining Hid allele, as well as loss of expression of the wild type Ptch1 allele. When passaged as subcutaneous allografts, these tumors grow aggressively and are Hedgehog pathway-dependent. This model was employed to evaluate the efficacy of orally administered Compound, and to correlate activity with drug exposure in plasma and tumors. Oral administration (PO) of a single dose of Compound 42 led to dose-dependent down-regulation of the HH pathway in subcutaneously implanted tumors, as measured by decreased GE-1 mRNA expression 8 hours post dose administration. Daily (QD) administration of the Compound PO led to a dose dependent inhibition of tumor growth, with frank tumor regression seen at higher doses. The approximate effective daily oral dose for 50% inhibition of tumor growth (ED50) is 4 mg/kg. When animals were treated QD for 21 days, long term survival was observed following cessation of treatment (>60 days), with little to no tumor re-growth. This demonstrates that the hedgehog inhibitor Compound 42 inhibits both the hedgehog pathway and tumor growth in a tumor dependent on the hedgehog pathway due to a genetic mutation. Example 31 Lung Cancer Model To test the activity of Compound 42 in a human SCLC tumor model, LX22 cells were implanted subcutaneously into the flank of the right leg. LX22 is primary xenograft model of SCLC derived from chemo-naive patients, which has been maintained by mouse to mouse passaging. This tumor responds to etoposide/carboplatin chemotherapy in way that closely resembles a clinical setting. LX22 regresses during chemotherapy treatment, goes through a period of remission, and then begins to recur. In the LX22 model, Compound single agent activity and its ability to modulate the chemoresistant recurrence was tested. On day 32 post tumor implant, mice were randomized into three dosing groups to receive Vehicle (30% HBPCD), Compound, or the chemotherapy combination of etoposide and carboplatin (E/P). Compound 42 was administered orally at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and after 16 consecutive doses there was no measurable difference between the treated and vehicle groups. Etoposide was administered i.v at 12 mg/kg on days 34, 35, 36, and 48, while Carboplatin was administered i.v. at 60 mg/kg on days 34, 41, and 48, post tumor implant. On day 50, the E/P treated mice were further randomized to receive either Vehicle (30% HPBCD) or Compound follow up treatment. The Compound was administered at the oral multi-dose MTD of 40 mg/kg/day, and after 35 consecutive doses there was a substantial delay in tumor recurrence in the treated group, compared to the vehicle group (p=0.0101). Example 32 Multiple Myeloma The ability of Compound 42 to inhibit the growth of multiple myeloma cells (MM) in vitro was tested, using human multiple myeloma cells lines (NCI-H929 and KMS12) and primary clinical bone marrow specimens derived from patients with MM. The cells were treated for 96 hours with Compound, washed, then plated in methylcellulose. Tumor colonies were quantified 10-21 days later as an indicator of cell growth potential following treatment. Treatment of cell lines or primary patient specimens resulted in decreased cell growth compared to an untreated control. Where the untreated control showed 100% growth of cells, each of the treated cell lines, as well as the clinical samples, showed less than about 25% growth. Example 33 Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome The ability of Compound 42 to inhibit the in vitro growth of human cell lines derived from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, cell line U937) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, cell line KG1 and KG1a) was studied. Each of the cell lines was treated for 72 hours with Compound 42 (1.0 uM) followed by plating in methylcellulose. Growth of these cell lines was inhibited by Compound 42, as summarized in the table below.

Each of the cell lines was treated for 72 hours with Compound 42 (1.0 uM) followed by plating in methylcellulose. Growth of these cell lines was inhibited by Compound 42, as summarized in the table below. TABLE 3 Inhibition of cell growth in HD and NHL Disease HD NHL Cell line L428 RL Jeko-1 % colony formation 21.4 14.3 27.4 with Compound 42 (relative to vehicle control) Example 35 Pre-B Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia The activity of Compound 42 (1 uM) against three pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines (REH, RS4-11, and Nalm-6) was studied, using a transient transfection assay in which a Gli-responsive luciferase reporter was transiently transfected into cells. Treatment with Compound 42 repressed luciferase activity compared to a vehicle treated control (Table 4). This demonstrates that Compound 42 is an effective antagonist of the hedgehog pathway.

Following treatment, cells were washed and plated in methylcellulose. There was little inhibition of colony formation, but subsequent replating of colonies demonstrated a significant inhibition of cell growth (Table 5).
