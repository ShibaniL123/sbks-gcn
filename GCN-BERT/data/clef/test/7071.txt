CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/384,590, filed on Jul. 16, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to benzenesulfonate of 2-[[[2-[(hydroxyacetyl) amino]-4-pyridinyl]methyl]thio]-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-3-pyridinecarboxamide that is highly safe, excellent in storage stability, and useful as a pharmaceutical, a crystal of the same, a crystal polymorph thereof, and production methods thereof. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical containing at least one selected from the group consisting of benzenesulfonate of 2-[[[2-[(hydroxyacetyl) amino]-4-pyridinyl]methyl]thio]-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-3-pyridinecarboxamide, a crystal of the same, and a crystal polymorph thereof BACKGROUND ART Usually, for pharmaceutical products, safety, quality, and stable supply are required, as well as a therapeutic efficacy on diseases. Therefore, for a compound serving as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical product, little side effect, excellent storage stability of the compound in various conditions (light, temperature, humidity and so on), and ease of process control in a production stage of the pharmaceutical product (ease of handling) and the like are requested, and the compound will be a pharmaceutical product only when all of these requirements are satisfied. On the other hand, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0149574 (PTL 1) describes that 2-[[[2-[(hydroxyacetyl) amino]-4-pyridinyl]methyl]thio]-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-3-pyridinecarboxamide exhibits a cell proliferation inhibiting effect in a test system using a VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation reaction evaluation system, exhibits a tumor proliferation suppressing effect in a test system using a tumor-bearing mouse model, exhibits a paw edema suppressing effect in a test system using a rat adjuvant arthritis model, and exhibits a choroidal neovascularization inhibiting effect in a test system using a rat choroidal neovascularization model, and that, owing to these pharmacologic effects, 2-[[[2-[(hydroxyacetyl)amino]-4-pyridinyl]methyl]thio]-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-3-pyridinecarboxamide is useful as a pharmaceutical, and is especially expected as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema and the like. PTL 1 also describes that 2-[[[2-[(hydroxyacetyl) amino]-4-pyridinyl]methyl]thio]-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-3-pyridinecarboxamide has a property of a light yellow solid. However, PTL 1 lacks concrete description of benzenesulfonate of 2-[[[2-[(hydroxyacetyl) amino]-4-pyridinyl]methyl]thio]-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-3-pyridinecarboxamide, a crystal of the same, a crystal polymorph thereof and production methods thereof, and lacks description and suggestion of a problem that 2-[[[2-[(hydroxyacetyl) amino]-4-pyridinyl]methyl]thio]-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-3-pyridinecarboxamide will cause mineral deposition in the stomach when it is orally administered repeatedly. CITATION LIST Patent Literature PTL 1: U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0149574 SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problem In the course of developing 2-[[[2-[(hydroxyacetyl) amino]-4-pyridinyl]methyl]thio]-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-3-pyridinecarboxamide (hereinafter, also referred to as “compound A”) that is useful as a pharmaceutical, the present inventors found that there were the following multiple problems: 1) compound A or its salt is difficult to be recrystallized, the storage stability largely differs depending on the kind of the salt, and it is very difficult to obtain a salt of compound A having excellent storage stability; 2) in a crystallization process of compound A or its salt, it is very difficult to control a crystal polymorph, and 3) compound A (free body) causes mineral deposition in the stomach when it is orally administered repeatedly. Solution to Problem In light of the above, the present inventors made diligent effort focusing on the kind of the salt in compound A for solving all of the aforementioned problems 1) to 3). As a result, the present inventors found that compound A formed a salt with methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid. For examining the storage stability for these salts with compound A, a 1-week preliminary stability test (severe test) was executed. As a result, methanesulfonate of compound A decomposed by light, and p-toluenesulfonate decomposed by humidity, to cause a decrease in purity (decomposition) of about 1% to about 8%, demonstrating that these salts have great problems in storage stability. On the other hand, benzenesulfonate of compound A did not show a decrease in purity (decomposition) by light, humidity and other factors in a similar test, demonstrating that it has very high storage stability. Focusing on the existence of a crystal polymorph of benzenesulfonate of compound A, the present inventors also found that benzenesulfonate of compound A has at least two crystal forms and found a method of producing the two crystal forms selectively. Further, the present inventors found that mineral deposition in the stomach was observed in a rat 1-week repeated oral administration toxicity test (30 mg/kg) of compound A, whereas mineral deposition in the stomach was not observed in a rat 4-week repeated oral administration toxicity test (30 mg/kg) of benzenesulfonate of compound A, and accomplished the present invention. That is, the present invention is as follows. The present invention is benzenesulfonate of 2-[[[2-[(hydroxyacetyl) amino]-4-pyridinyl]methyl]thio]-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-3-pyridinecarboxamide.
