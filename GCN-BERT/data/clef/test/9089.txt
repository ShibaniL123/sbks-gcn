Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-{3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl}pyrrolidin-2-one (Compound 41)
(41-1) Synthesis of N,4-dihydroxybenzene-1-carboxyimidamide (Compound 41-1)
A mixture of 4-hydroxybenzonitrile (5.95 g, 50 mmol), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (5.21 g, 75 mmol), and sodium hydrogen carbonate (6.30 g, 75 mmol) in methanol (100 mL) was heated under reflux for 22 hours. After cooling to room temperature, volatiles were evaporated off under reduced pressure. Water (60 mL) was added to the mixture, and the insoluble were collected by filtration, and washed with water, to obtain the title compound (7.5 g, yield 99 %).
