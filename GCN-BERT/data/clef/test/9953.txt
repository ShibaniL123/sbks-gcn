!I 6;I SPECIFICATION To tll Whom It May Cnuoern: Be it known that I, Alfred J. Breeden. a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Grinnell, in the county of Poweshiek, and State of Iowa United States of America, business man, have invented a certain new and usei l CATCHER ATTACHENT FOR Y Æ,VN ìJEEP S AND THE LIKE of which the following is a specification: The object of my invention is to provide an attachment for lawn sweepers and mowers and the llke, adapted to catch the sweepings or cuttings and to convey them to a convenient point and fflseharge the same, and having dumping means whereby light anoE loose material may be positively dumped and deposÆ èoE on the ground surface whîle the devloe is being advanced over the ground surface. Qre specifically it is the object of my invention to provide in connection therewith improved dumping means of simple, durable and inexpensive construetlon, and whleh is positive in its aetlon. A further object is to provide in a cateher attachment of that type employing a flexible bottom adapted to have one end swing rearwardly at the time the dumpfng takes place, improved means for maintaining a constant tension on the bottom member to cause it to fit snugly with the side members of the catcher, to prevent leakage. A further object is to provide an improved operating i' i »J ........ .... , 85.4Y3 mechanism for the flexible bottom° V invention consists in the construction, arrangement and combination of the various parts of the device, whereby the objects contemplated are attained, as hereinafter more fully set forth, pointed out in my claims, and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a side elevation of my improved device. Figure 2 is a llano view of the same. Figure 3 is a longitudinal sectional view of the same, taken en the line 3--3 of Figure 2. Figure 4 is an enlarged, detail, sectional view taken on the llne 4--4 of Figure I° Figure 5 is an enlargeoE detail view of a portion of the member for supporting the flexible bottom. My ImproveoE catcher comprises a pair of spaced side members l0 having their forward ends connected by a plate ll anoE their rear ends connected wïth a back member 12. The bottom edges of the members I0 are inclined upwardly anâ rearwardly, the said inclined edges each being provide& with a hinger segmental member l The lower edge of the member IS is forme circular. The hinged edges of the members ate connected by hî es 14. The baek ends of the members I0 are provided with downwardly extending legs 15, each of which is provided wìth a wheel 16. The forward ends of the members I0 are eaeh provided wîth a forwardly extending portion lç. The members I may be connected dlreetly to the frame of the lawn mower or sweeper, or they may be provided with arms -2 i! i!i 18, each of whleh has a wheel 19. ashen the wheels 19 are provided, the catcher may be operated independently of the sweeper or mower to convey the material to a dumping location. ° adJ agent Secured/to each outer side of the members I0 is a handle bar 20, the back em s of the handle bars being connected by a cross bar 21, which serves as a handle Zor operating the catcher. Supported on the upper edge of each of the members lO is a bracket 22, each oî said brackets being provídeå with a pivot member 23, sald pivot members being located in the center o the circle inscribing the lower edges o the members i Pivotally connected to the inner face o£ each of the members and upon the pîvot member 23 is a rear araly extending bar 24. The rear ends of he bars 24 are àeslgneã ta support a bar 25 aãapteŒE te be elevated and lowerea adjacent t« the rear ends of the members lO and te move upwardly empestée the b ek of the bar 12. Springs 6 are pro iŒEe for yieldably supporting said bar 25 in its elevatea positî cm. Adjustably secured te the back face of the bar 25 is au aorta 2ç, preferably formed of several thicknesses of fabrîe, which are q Æl ed together. A series of stiffen- g ribs 28 is provioEe@ between the layers o fabric. The member 2 provides a bettòm for the heather. The upper eoEge of the member 27 is seeureoE t a plate 29 having slots 0 for receiving set screws 31 said set screws Being secured in the plate 5. This provides means for ajustable seeurlng the upper eoEge of the member 27 to the bar iï¸ i i0 Il 14. i? 2S £7 The width of the member 27 is such that its outer edges will engage the curved edge of bhe members 13 with its free edge in engagement with the rear edge of the plate ll. The free edge of the member 27 is provîded with a rod 32 having enãs projecting beyond the side members 13. Each of the members lO is provided with a pivoted hook 33 designed te receive the projecting ends of the rod 32 when the member 27 ìs stretched adjacent te the curved edges of the members 13. A spring 34 is provided for retaining the hooks 33 in a closes posítion. Each of the hooks has an upwardly extending arm 35. A chain 36 is eonnecteã to each of the members 35 and extends upwardly and rearwardly and passes through eyelets 37, the free end of each chain being connected to a llnk 38, which in turn is connected to the handle 21 by a short chain 39. The chains 36 provide means• for relea iñg the hooks 33 from the rod 32, after which the forward enoE of the member 27 will fall upon the groumã surface and be rolled backwardly as the device is aoEvance•oE in such a manner that the material within the cataher will be àelivereã to the ground surface, which will pass beneath the member 27. For returning the apron 27, I have pivotally connected to the outer face of each of the brackets 22, and upon the pivot members 23, rearwardly extending arms 40, having their free ends connected with a relier 41. Supported to the rear end o each of the members I0 is an upwardly projecting arm 42, in which is rotatively mounted a rock shaft 43, having downwardly and rearwardly extending arms 44. A llnk 43 is õ iI pivotally connected to each of the arms 44 and also to the arms 40. The shaft 43 is also provided with an upwardly extending lever 46, which provides means whereby the shaft 43 will be rocked. The roller 4.1 normally rests in the position illustrated in Figure 3. If will be seen that if the upper end of the lever 46 is moved rearwardly, the roller 4_I will be moved foz varãly causing the rearwardly extending portion of the apron 27 to be gathered, and placed adjacent to the elreular edge of the members 13, until the outer ends of the shafts Z2 engage the forward edge of the lower ends of the members 40, said engagement taking plaee at a time slightly before the rod 32 enters the hooks 33, at which time the apron 27 is drawn taut. Further movement of the arms 40 will force the rod 32 into the hooks 33, causîmg the apron to be moved longitudinally of he bar 25 to be lowereŒE against the pressure of the springs 26. 9he said springs 26 support the apron in a taut condition against the curved edges of the members 13, after which the roller 41 may be returned to its normal position of movement by means of suitable springs 47, said springs being connected to the arms 40 and the arms 44. In this connection it should be noted that the aetîon of the springs 26 and the bar 25 are very important. I have fraud by astral exxerlenee that it is almost impossible te throw the rod Z2 into the hooks 33 if the yielàable bar 25 is omitted. If the ylelãable bar 25 is omitted, then the apron 27 would have to be slightly longer than illustrated, so that the rod 32 will Just enter the hooks 33 when the apron i7 Il IZ is drawn taut. I find in actual practice that instead of the rod entering between the upper eoEge of the hooks 33 and the lower eoEge of the members 13, it would be thrown to position beneath the lower edge of the hooks 33, and the rod would thereby fall to enter the hooks. This is due to the fact that the free end of the apron is always extending rearwardly as illustrated by dotted lines in Figure l, as the lower end of the bars 40 are being aãranted. The momentum or centrifugal force of the bar, as it leaves the ground surface, causes the bar to be thrown to the under side of the hook member 33. By providing the yieldable bar 25, it will be seen that the rod 32 is caused to snugly fît against the forward edge of the members and to be thrown into 9osìtÆon in alinement with the hooks before it reaches the free ends of the hooks. Another Important feature of my device lies in the pivoted slåe members lõ, which are so arranged that when the apron 27 is moveŒE to its closed position, the saiŒE side members 13 will be inclined inwardly in the manner illustrated in Figure 4, due to the upward tensìon on the apron. If the laad within the catcher somewhat stretches the apron, then if will be seen that the side members will automatically assume a position near the vertical, causing a tight fit to always be maintained between the lower edges of the members 15 and the apron, even if the said apron is stretched x eonsiderahly. The ribs 28 provide stiffening means to prevent the apron from sagging between its ends. The outer ends of the members 28 are designed to rest against the lower Y edges of the members 13. OE e set screws 31 provide means whereby any excessive stretching of the apron may be reaãj%steã te maintain the sÆoEe members 13 normally in a Droper inclined position. This catcher ìs particularly adapted for eolleotÆng loose material, such as leaves.
