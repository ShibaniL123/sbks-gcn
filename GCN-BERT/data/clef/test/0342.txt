Example 51 : Preparation of 2'-amino-6-(2-amino-6-morpholinopyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-[2,4'-bipyridin]-5-ol (LXXVI)
Example 51-1 : Preparation of ethyl 3-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-3-oxopropanoate (LXXII)
Methyl 6-bromo-3-methoxypicolinate (4.18 g, 16.99 mmol) obtained in Preparation Example 3-3 was dissolved in ethanol (85 mL). The resulting solution was cooled to 0 Â°C and potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) was added dropwise thereto. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 hrs. Distilled water and acetic acid (5 mL) were added dropwise to the solution and the solution was stirred for 10 min. The solution was diluted with ethylacetate and washed with water. The washed organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethylacetate = 2/1) to give the white title compound (3.41 g, 66 %).
