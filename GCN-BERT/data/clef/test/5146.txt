TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure generally pertains to golf grips, and is also directed toward a golf grip including angled recessed or protruded features. BACKGROUND Grips for sporting implements such as golf clubs have taken numerous forms over the years. Early grips consisted of a wrap material, such as leather, in a helical pattern around the handle portion of the golf club. Over the years other materials such as polyurethane have been used as a wrap material. Golf grips have evolved from the wrap type grip to a tapered cylinder of rubber, polyurethane, TPE, or similar elastomeric and shock absorbing materials that slip over the butt end of a golf club shaft. Golf grips may also include fibers, cords, fabric, or cork imbedded within the elastomeric materials. Golf grips are generally formed by a compression molding or an injection molding process. The material from which a golf grip is made may be relatively hard to avoid torsion of the golf club. The harder surface may be undesirable for obtaining the desired friction between the golf grip and the user's hands. Most golf grips include features that recede into or protrude out from the surface of the golf grip. These features may provide traction to help a golfer retain the club securely in the golfer's hands. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE A golf grip for a golf club includes a butt end, a tip end, a grip surface, and a gripping feature. The tip end includes a shaft opening. The grip surface extends between the butt end and the tip end with an axis extending from the butt end to the tip end. The gripping feature includes a rake surface forming an acute angle with the grip surface. The rake surface extends into the grip at an acute angle relative to a plane perpendicular to the axis. Other features and advantages of the present invention should be apparent from the following description which illustrates, by way of example, aspects of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The apparatus disclosed herein includes a golf grip with gripping features raked in the axial direction or in the circumferential direction of the golf grip. The rake may be angled in the direction of an inertial force (centrifugal force) or in the direction of a rotational force (torque). The rake formed between the gripping features and a golfer's hands may increase the friction between the golfer's hands and the golf grip. The rake of the gripping feature may also create a mechanical interface with the golfer's hand which may resist the inertial or rotational forces of the golf club. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a golf club 50 with a golf grip (“grip”) 100. Golf club 50 includes a shaft 60, a club head 70, and a golf grip such as grip 100. The shaft 60 may be a steel or graphite cylindrical tube. The length of shaft 60 is generally determined by the type of club head attached and by the length of the measurement from the golfer's wrist to the floor. The club head 70 may be formed from any number of materials from processes such as forging and casting. Club head 70 may be any type of club head such as a driver, wood, hybrid, iron, or putter club head. Club head 70 is affixed to one end of shaft 60. Grip 100 is affixed to the shaft 60 at the end distal to club head 70. Grip 100 includes a butt end 110 and a tip end 120. Grip 100 is affixed to shaft 60 by inserting shaft 60 into the tip end 120 of grip 100. FIG. 2 is a plan view of an exemplary grip 100 with gripping features 140. Grip 100 has the shape of a hollow cylinder or tube extending from a closed butt end 110 to an open tip end 120. Grip 100 includes grip surface 130, the outer surface of the cylindrical shape. Grip surface 130 extends between butt end 110 and tip end 120. Grip surface 130 may taper from butt end 110 to tip end 120 with the width or diameter of grip surface 130 getting progressively smaller from butt end 110 to tip end 120. The cross-section of grip 100 at grip surface 130 may be a circle, an ellipse, a stadium shape, or other similar shapes. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the grip 100 of FIG. 2 taken along line III-III. Each grip may include an axis, such as axis 170. All references to radial, axial, and circumferential directions and measures refer to the grip axis, unless specified otherwise, and terms such as “inner” and “outer” generally indicate a lesser or greater radial distance from the axis. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the butt end 110 of grip 100 may include an end cap 112 and butt end features 116. End cap 112 has a circular or disk shape that closes the cylindrical shape of grip 100 at butt end 110. End cap 112 may include a vent hole 114.

Golf grips with raked gripping features may be made from materials such as rubber, polyurethane, TPE, foams, or similar elastomeric and shock absorbing materials. Golf grips may also be composites and may include fibers, cords, fabric, or cork imbedded within the elastomeric materials. Golf grips with gripping features may help a golfer retain the golf club securely in the golfer's hands. Gripping features raked relative to a golfer's hands may improve the traction or friction between the grip and the golfer's hands to help a golfer retain the club securely in the golfer's hands. A golf grip with raked gripping features may improve traction by creating a mechanical interface with the golfer's hand. Improved traction may allow the golfer to grip the golf club with a lighter grip or less grip pressure. Gripping a golf club with less grip pressure may reduce the tension in the muscles of the golfer, allowing a golfer to maintain a faster and more fluid swing, which correlates to greater distances and accuracy of golf shots. The rake of the gripping feature may be angled in the direction of an axial or inertial force (centrifugal force). The inertia of the golf club during a golf swing tends to pull the golf club away from the golfer. This inertial force may be generally in the axial direction of the golf club in the direction of the club head. The gripping features with rake angles in the axial direction of the inertial force may increase traction for any possible movement of the golfer's hand relative to the grip in the direction against the grain of the rake or in the direction opposite a component of the rake angle. The rake may also be angled in the direction of a circumferential or rotational force (torque). Various forces throughout a golf swing may apply a torque to the golf club, such as off center hits of a golf ball relative to the club head. Similar to counteracting inertial forces, gripping features with rake angles in the direction of the torque may increase traction for any possible twisting of the grip in the golfer's hand in the direction against the grain of the rake or in the direction opposite a component of the rake angle.
