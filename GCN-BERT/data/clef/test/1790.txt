CA 02769804 2012-03-01 MOUNTING SYSTEM FOR SPORTING EQUIPMENT BACKGROUND [0001] To free up floor space or storage space and prevent damage, users and retailers hang sporting equipment on racks for display or storage. For example, skis, snowboards, skateboards and surfboards are ail pieces of elongated sporting equipment that take up significant space and are costly to replace if they become damaged. In addition, these types of sporting equipment include design components and aesthetic detailing, which, if not raised to eye level, would not be otherwise appreciated. [0002] The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. SUMMARY [0003] A mounting system for sporting equipment includes a first wall mount and a second wall mount. The first wall mount includes a first faceplate attached to a first protruding flange of a first base member and the second wall mount includes a second faceplate attached to a second protruding flange of a second base member. Both the first and second protruding flanges include top edges, bottom edges, front edges and slots for receiving sporting equipment. The slots are defined by upper edges that intersect with the top edges of the protruding flanges, lower edges that intersect with the front edges of the protruding flanges, and coupling edges that couple the upper edges to the lower edges. Both the first and second faceplates also include slots that correspond with the slots of the protruding flanges. [0004] In one embodiment, the upper edges of the slots intersect with the top edges of the protruding flanges and faceplates at a first angle, while the lower edges of the slots intersect with the front edges of the protruding flanges and faceplates at a second angle. The sum of the first angle and the second angle is substantially equal to 90 degrees. [0005] In another embodiment, the lower edges of the slots have lengths that are less than lengths of the corresponding upper edges. [0006] In yet another embodiment, the first wall mount and the second wall mount can be mounted to a support structure in two different configurations. In a first configuration, side edges of the first wall mount and the second wall mount are in contact with each other in order to CA 02769804 2012-03-01 display sporting equipment in a vertical orientation. In a second configuration, side edges of the first wall mount and the second wall mount are located a spaced distance from each other in order to display sporting equipment in a horizontal orientation.

The curved portions of top edge 144 and bottom edge 146 intersect with side edge 148. In addition, the straight portions of top edge 144 and bottom edge 146 as well as mounting surface 140 and opposing surface 142 intersect with receiving portion 138. [0033] Receiving portion 138 is defined by a rightward facing surface or outwardly facing surface 150, a leftward facing surface or inwardly facing surface 152, a top edge 154, a bottom edge 156 and a front edge 158. As illustrated, at least a portion of bottom edge 156 is curved. The curved portion of bottom edge 156 intersects with front edge 158, while the straight portion of bottom edge 156 is substantially parallel with top edge 154 and substantially perpendicular with front edge 158. In addition, top edge 154 and the straight portion of bottom edge 156 as well as rightward facing surface 150 and leftward facing surface 152 intersect with mounting portion 136. In particular, rightward facing surface 150 intersects with mounting surface 140 and leftward facing surface 152 intersects with opposing surface 142. CA 02769804 2012-03-01 [0034] First faceplate or first end piece 108 of first wall mount 102 is formed of a single, continuous material, such as wood or a composite wood material. First faceplate 108 is attached to leftward facing surface 130 of receiving portion 118 of first base member 106. In particular, first faceplate 108 includes a mounting surface 160, an opposing surface 162, a top edge 164, a bottom edge 166, a front edge 168 and a back edge 169. Mounting surface 160 of first faceplate 108 is directly attached or coupled to leftward facing surface 130 of first base member 106 by a fastener, such as an adhesive. As illustrated, the shapes of the edges of first faceplate 108 correspond with the shape of the edges of receiving portion 118 of first base member 106. In particular, at least a portion of bottom edge 166 is curved. The curved portion of bottom edge 166 intersects with front edge 168. In addition, back edge 169 is substantially perpendicular to and intersects with top edge 164 and back edge 169 is substantially perpendicular to and intersects with bottom edge 166. However, the edges of first faceplate 108 have dimensions that are less than the dimensions of receiving portion 118. For example, a height 170 of receiving portion 118 is greater than a height 171 of first faceplate 108 and a depth 172 of receiving portion 118 is greater than a depth 173 of first faceplate 108. Therefore, from a left side view, as illustrated in FIG. 4, portions of leftward facing surface 130 of receiving portion 118 are visible. [0035] Second faceplate 112 of second wall mount 104 is formed of a single, continuous material, such as wood or a composite wood material. Second faceplate 112 is attached to rightward facing surface 150 of receiving portion 138 of second base member 110. In particular, second faceplate 112 includes a mounting surface 174, an opposing surface 175, a top edge 176, a bottom edge 177, a front edge 178 and a back edge 179. Mounting surface 174 of second faceplate 112 is directly attached or coupled to rightward facing surface 150 of first base member by a fastener, such as an adhesive. As illustrated, the shapes of the edges of second faceplate 112 correspond with the shape of the edges of receiving portion 138 of second base member In particular, at least a portion of bottom edge 177 is curved. The curved portion of bottom edge 177 intersects with front edge 178. In addition, back edge 179 is substantially perpendicular to and intersects with top edge 176 and back edge 179 is substantially perpendicular to and intersects with bottom edge 177. However, the edges of second faceplate 112 have dimensions that are less than the dimensions of receiving portion 138. For example, a height 180 of receiving portion 138 is greater than a height 181 of second faceplate 112 and a depth 182 of receiving CA 02769804 2012-03-01 portion 138 is greater than a depth 183 of second faceplate 112. Therefore, from a right side view, as illustrated in FIG. 5, portions of rightward facing surface 150 of receiving portion 138 are visible. [0036] Receiving portion or protruding flange 118 of first base member or first support piece 106 includes a receiving slot 202. Receiving slot 202 is configured to receive sporting equipment for display and/or storage. Receiving slot 202 is defined by an upper edge 204, a lower edge 206 and a connecting edge 208. Upper edge 204 is a straight edge and intersects with top edge 134 of receiving portion 118 at a first angle 210. Lower edge 206 is a straight edge and intersects with front edge 137 of receiving portion 118 at a second angle 212. Connecting edge 208 connects upper edge 204 to lower edge 206 and, in one embodiment, is curved. However, in other embodiments connecting edge 208 can be straight or include a plurality of straight edges. Regardless, connecting edge 208 allows upper edge 204 to be located a spaced distance 209 from lower edge 206. For example, spaced distance 209 can be substantially equal to 1.375 inches. [0037] In one embodiment, the sum of the first angle 210 and the second angle 212 is substantially equal to 90 degrees. In still another embodiment, second angle 212 is greater than first angle 210. For example, first angle 210 can be substantially equal to 53 degrees and second angle 212 can be substantially equal to 37 degrees. Upper edge 204 of receiving slot 202 of receiving portion 118 includes a length 214. Lower edge 206 of receiving slot 202 of receiving portion 118 includes a length 216. Length 216 of lower edge 206 is greater than length 214 of upper edge 204. [0038] First faceplate or first end piece 108 of first wall mount 102 also includes a receiving slot 222. Receiving slot 222 is similar to receiving slot 202 of receiving portion 118 and is configured to correspond with receiving slot 202 when the first faceplate or first end piece 108 is attached to leftward facing surface or outwardly facing surface 130 of receiving portion 118. Therefore, receiving slot 222 is also configured to receive the sporting equipment for display and/or storage. Receiving slot 222 is defined by an upper edge 224, a lower edge 226 and a connecting edge 228. Upper edge 224 is a straight edge and intersects with top edge 164 of first faceplate 108 at a first angle 230. Lower edge 226 is a straight edge and intersects with front edge 168 of first faceplate 108 at a second angle 232. Connecting edge 228 connects upper edge 224 to lower edge 226 and, corresponds with the connecting edge 208 of receiving portion 118. CA 02769804 2012-03-01 Connecting edge 228 allows upper edge 224 to be located a spaced distance 229 from lower edge 226. For example, spaced distance 229 can be substantially equal to 1.125 inches. [0039] In one embodiment, the sum of the first angle 230 and the second angle 232 is substantially equal to 90 degrees. In still another embodiment, second angle 232 is greater than first angle 230. For example, first angle 230 can be substantially equal to 53 degrees and second angle 232 can be substantially equal to 37 degrees. Upper edge 224 of receiving slot 222 of first faceplate 108 includes a length 234. Lower edge 226 of receiving slot 222 of first faceplate 108 includes a length 236. Length 236 of lower edge 226 is greater than length 234 of upper edge 224. [0040] While slot 202 of receiving portion 118 corresponds with slot 222 of first faceplate 108, slots 202 and 222 are not aligned as evidenced by the difference in spaced distances 209 and 229, the difference in lengths 214 and 234 and the difference in lengths 216 and 236. In particular, spaced distance 209 of slot 202 is greater than spaced distance 229 of slot 222, length 214 is greater than length 234 and length 216 is greater than length 236. Therefore, and as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 8, the surface area of upper edge 224, lower edge 226 and connecting edge 228 of first faceplate 108 are the components that are in contact with sporting equipment when received by slots 202 and 222. [0041] Receiving portion or protruding flange 138 of second base member or second support piece 110 includes a receiving slot 232. Receiving slot 232 is configured to receive sporting equipment for display and/or storage. Receiving slot 232 is defined by an upper edge 234, a lower edge 236 and a connecting edge 238. Upper edge 234 is a straight edge and intersects with top edge 154 of receiving portion 138 at a first angle 240. Lower edge 236 is a straight edge and intersects with front edge 158 of receiving portion 138 at a second angle 242. Connecting edge 238 connects upper edge 234 to lower edge 236 and, in one embodiment, is curved. However, in other embodiments connecting edge 238 can be straight or include a plurality of straight edges. Regardless, connecting edge 238 allows upper edge 234 to be located a spaced distance 239 from lower edge 236. For example, spaced distance 239 can be substantially equal to 1.375 inches. [0042] In one embodiment, the sum of the first angle 240 and the second angle 242 is substantially equal to 90 degrees. In still another embodiment, second angle 242 is greater than first angle 240. For example, first angle 240 can be substantially equal to 53 degrees and second CA 02769804 2012-03-01 angle 242 can be substantially equal to 37 degrees. Upper edge 234 of receiving slot 232 of receiving portion 138 includes a length 244. Lower edge 236 of receiving slot 232 of receiving portion 138 includes a length 246. Length 246 of lower edge 236 is greater than length 244 of upper edge 234. [0043] Second faceplate or second end piece 112 of second wall mount 104 also includes a receiving slot 252. Receiving slot 252 is similar to receiving slot 232 of receiving portion 138 and is configured to correspond with receiving slot 232 when the second faceplate or second end piece 112 is attached to rightward facing surface or outwardly facing surface 150 of receiving portion 138. Therefore, receiving slot 252 is also configured to receive the sporting equipment for display and/or storage. Receiving slot 252 is defined by an upper edge 254, a lower edge 256 and a connecting edge 258. Upper edge 254 is a straight edge and intersects with top edge 176 of second faceplate 112 at a first angle 260. Lower edge 256 is a straight edge and intersects with front edge 178 of second faceplate 112 at a second angle 262. Connecting edge 258 connects upper edge 254 to lower edge 256 and, corresponds with the connecting edge 238 of receiving portion 138. Connecting edge 258 allows upper edge 254 to be located a spaced distance 259 from lower edge 256. For example, spaced distance 259 can be substantially equal to 1.125 inches. [0044] In one embodiment, the sum of the first angle 260 and the second angle 262 is substantially equal to 90 degrees. In still another embodiment, second angle 262 is greater than first angle 260. For example, first angle 260 can be substantially equal to 53 degrees and second angle 262 can be substantially equal to 37 degrees. Upper edge 254 of receiving slot 252 of second faceplate 112 includes a length 264. Lower edge 256 of receiving slot 252 of first faceplate 112 includes a length 266. Length 266 of lower edge 256 is greater than length 264 of upper edge 254. [0045] While slot 232 of receiving portion 138 corresponds with slot 252 of second faceplate 112, slots 232 and 252 are not aligned as evidenced by the difference in spaced distances 239 and 259, the difference in lengths 244 and 264 and the difference in lengths 246 and 266. In particular, spaced distance 239 of slot 232 is greater than spaced distance 259 of slot 252, length 244 is greater than length 264 and length 246 is greater than length 266. Therefore, and as illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 9, the surface area of upper edge 254, lower edge 256 and connecting CA 02769804 2012-03-01 edge 258 of second faceplate 112 are the components that are in contact with sporting equipment when received by slots 232 and 252. [0046] FIG. 10 illustrates a perspective view of the first configuration of the mounting system 100 illustrated in FIGS. 1-7 with exemplary sporting equipment 300 being supported by the mounting system. As illustrated, exemplary sporting equipment 300 is a skateboard having a pair of trucks or axles 302 and 303, which support wheels 304, and a deck 306. In FIGS. 1-7 and 10, first wall mount 102 and second wall mount 104 are mounted or attached to support structure (e.g., a wall) 114 such that side edge 128 of mounting portion 116 is in contact with or touching side edge 148 of mounting portion 136.

In other words, receiving slots 202 and 222 of first wall mount 102 and receiving slots 232 and 252 of second wall mount 104 receive the same portion (i.e., the truck) of the sporting equipment, but at different locations along the same portion (i.e., at a first location along the truck and at a second location along the truck). In this configuration, deck 306 of the skateboard is oriented substantially vertical for display. [0047] FIG. 18 illustrates a perspective view of the second configuration of the mounting system 100 illustrated in FIG. 11-17 with exemplary sporting equipment 400 being supported by the mounting system. As illustrated, exemplary sporting equipment 400 is a skateboard having a pair of trucks or axles 402 and 403, which support wheels 404, and a deck 406. In FIGS. 10-18, first wall mount 102 and second wall mount 104 are mounted or attached to support structure (e.g., a wall) 114 such that side edge 128 of mounting portion 116 is located a spaced distance 410 from side edge 148 of mounting portion 136. In such an arrangement, deck 406 of the skateboard is deposited into or received by receiving slots 202 (FIG. 8) and 222 (FIG. 4) of first wall mount 102 and by receiving slots 232 (FIG. 9) and 252 (FIG. 5) of second wall mount 104. In other words, receiving slots 202 and 222 of first wall mount 102 and receiving slots 232 and 252 of second wall mount 104 receive the same portion (i.e., the deck) of the sporting equipment, but at different locations along the same portion (i.e., at a first location along the deck and at a second location along the deck). In this configuration, the skateboard is mounted such that a CA 02769804 2012-03-01 bottom surface 412 of deck 406 is displayed for viewing. In addition, deck 406 of the skateboard is oriented substantially horizontal.
