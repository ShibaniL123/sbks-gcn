EDITORIAL NOTE 2015101266 - There are 3 pages of Description which are not page numbered A Glass Cleaning Brush Technical Field This utility model is a kind of glass cleaning brush. Background Technology Glass cleaning brush is used to clean relatively deep cups. Due to great depth, it is impossible for hands to touch the bottom. Therefore, those cups can only be cleaned with a brush, so as to avoid dirt at the bottom. In existing technologies, leaning brushes are of combined type of brush head and handle lever. After the completion of cleaning, water in the brush head needs to be dried. In this process, drops of water may splash. It is easy to wet the platform. Description on the Invention The technical issue to be solved by this utility model is to provide a kind of glass cleaning brush. After the completion of cleaning, the bronze drum dehydration sleeve of this device can realize squeeze dehydration of the sponge brush head, which is convenient for cleaning and dehydration of the sponge brush head. Moreover, it is unnecessary for swing. It is featured by simple and easy operation. To solve the said issue, this utility model adopts the following technical scheme: This kind of glass cleaning brush includes cylindrical handle lever and sponge brush head on the said lever. Brush grooves are evenly distributed on the external periphery of the said sponge brush head. The said brush grooves are arranged in an annular way. A dehydration sleeve is arranged on the body of the said handle lever. The said dehydration sleeve has an inner hole with the diameter greater than that of the said handle lever. When compressed to the limit, the said sponge brush head will transitionally coordinate with the said inner hole. As an optimized technical scheme, a suspension hole is arranged at the end of the said handle lever far away from the said sponge brush head. The end of the said handle lever away from the said sponge brush head is of spherical transition. As an optimized technical scheme, drain holes are arranged on the external periphery of the said dehydration sleeve. The said drain holes are connected with the said inner hole. As an optimized technical scheme, antiskid grooves are arranged on the external periphery of the said dehydration sleeve. The said antiskid groove and the said dehydration sleeve are of coaxial arrangement. As an optimized technical scheme, the said brush groove is a V-shaped or arc-shaped one. Beneficial effects of this utility model are described as follows: After the completion of cleaning, the bronze drum dehydration sleeve of this device can realize squeeze dehydration of the sponge brush head, which is convenient for cleaning and dehydration of the sponge brush head. Moreover, it is unnecessary for swing. This device is featured by simple and easy operation, simple structure, and low cost. It is suitable for promotion and wide application. Description on the Attached Figure To give a clearer description on this utility model or the technical plan in existing technologies, a brief instruction is made on the attached figure to be used in the implementation case or existing technical description. Obviously, the attached figure in the following descriptions is only an implementation case of this utility model. For ordinary technicians in this field, they can obtain other attached figures according to this attached figure on the premise of paying no any creative labor. Fig. 1 shows the structure diagram of this utility model. Specific Implementation Mode A detailed description is given on the optimized implemented cases of this utility model as follows by combining the attached figures, so as to make it easier for technicians in this field to understand relevant advantages and characteristics of this utility model, and thus make a clearer definition of the protective range of this utility model. As shown in Fig. 1, this utility model is a glass cleaning brush including cylindrical handle lever (1) and sponge brush head (2) on the said lever (1) . Brush grooves (201) are evenly distributed on the external periphery of the said sponge brush head (2). The said brush grooves (201) are arranged in an annular way. A dehydration sleeve (3) is arranged on the body of the said handle lever (1). The said dehydration sleeve (3) has an inner hole (not shown in the figure) with the diameter greater than that of the said handle lever (1). When compressed to the limit, the said sponge brush head (2) will transitionally coordinate with the said inner hole. There is an optimal implementation case in this utility model. A suspension hole (111) is arranged at the end of the said handle lever (1) far away from the said sponge brush head (2). The end of the said handle lever (1) away from the said sponge brush head (2) is of spherical transition. There is an optimal implementation case in this utility model. Drain holes (311) are arranged on the external periphery of the said dehydration sleeve (3) . The said drain holes (311) are connected with the said inner hole. There is an optimal implementation case in this utility model. Antiskid grooves (312) are arranged on the external periphery of the said dehydration sleeve (3). The said antiskid groove (312) and the said dehydration sleeve (3) are of coaxial arrangement. There is an optimal implementation case in this utility model. The said brush groove (201) is a V-shaped or arc-shaped one. Beneficial effects of this utility model are described as follows: After the completion of cleaning, the bronze drum dehydration sleeve of this device can realize squeeze dehydration of the sponge brush head, which is convenient for cleaning and dehydration of the sponge brush head. Moreover, it is unnecessary for swing. This device is featured by simple and easy operation, simple structure, and low cost. It is suitable for promotion and wide application. Above paragraphs are only about the specific implementation mode of this utility model. However, the scope of protection of this utility model is not limited to this description. Any change or replacement without creative work should be covered in the scope of protection of this utility model. Therefore, the scope of protection defined in the Claims prevails for that of this utility model. 1.
