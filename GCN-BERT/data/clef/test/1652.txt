FIBER-CONTAINING CARBOHYDRATE COMPOSITION CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is related to and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/784,286, entitled "FIBER-CONTAINING CARBOHYDRATE COMPOSITION" filed March 14, 2013, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and for all purposes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A variety of carbohydrates are used in food products, such as various sugars and starches. Many of these carbohydrates are digested in the human stomach and small intestine. Dietary fiber in food products, in contrast, is generally not digested in the stomach or small intestine, but is potentially fermentable by microorganisms in the large intestine. There is an interest in developing ingredients that are suitable for use in food products and that are either non-digestible or only digestible to a limited extent, in order to enhance the dietary fiber content or reduce the caloric content of the food. These modifications have certain health benefits. There is a need for edible materials which have a reduced content of easily digestible carbohydrates, and which can be used in place of, or in addition to, conventional carbohydrate products in foods. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One aspect of the invention is a process for making an oligosaccharide composition. The process comprises producing an aqueous composition that comprises at least one oligosaccharide and at least one monosaccharide by saccharification of starch; membrane filtering the aqueous composition to form a monosaccharide-rich stream and an oligosaccharide-rich stream; and recovering the oligosaccharide-rich stream. In one embodiment of the invention, the oligosaccharide-rich stream is slowly digestible by the human digestive system. "Slowly digestible" as the term is used herein means that a substantial quantity (e.g., at least about 50% on a dry solids basis, and in some cases at least about 75%, or at least about 90%) of the carbohydrates present in the stream are either not digested at all in the human stomach and small intestine, or are only digested to a limited extent. In another embodiment of the invention, the oligosaccharide-rich stream is resistant to digestion by the human digestive system. Both in vitro and in vivo tests can be performed to estimate rate and extent of carbohydrate digestion in humans. The "Englyst Assay" is an in vitro enzyme test that can be used to estimate the amounts of a carbohydrate ingredient that are rapidly digestible, slowly digestible or resistant to digestion (European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (1992) Volume 46 (Suppl. 2), pages S33-S50). Thus, any reference herein to "at least about 50% by weight on a dry solids basis" of a material being slowly digestible, or to a material being "primarily slowly digestible," means that the sum of the percentages that are classified as slowly digestible or as resistant by the Englyst assay totals at least about 50%. Likewise, any reference herein to "at least about 50% by weight on a dry solids basis" of a material being digestion-resistant, or to a material being "primarily digestion-resistant," means that the percentage that is classified as resistant by the Englyst assay is at least about 50%. In one embodiment of the process, the aqueous composition that is produced by saccharification of starch, followed by isomerization, comprises dextrose, fructose, and a mixture of oligosaccharides. This aqueous composition can be nanofiltered to separate it into the monosaccharide-rich permeate stream and the oligosaccharide-rich retentate stream. The oligosaccharide-rich stream can comprise at least about 50% by weight oligosaccharides on a dry solids basis, or in some cases at least about 90%. In certain embodiments of the process, the oligosaccharide-rich stream will still comprise a minor amount of dextrose and fructose. "A minor amount" is used herein to mean less than 50% by weight on a dry solids basis. The process, can, in some embodiments, also include one or more of the following steps: (1) contacting the oligosaccharide-rich stream with an isomerization enzyme, such that at least some of the dextrose is converted to fructose, thereby producing an isomerized oligosaccharide-rich stream; (2) membrane filtering the oligosaccharide-rich stream to produce a second monosaccharide-rich stream and a second oligosaccharide-rich stream that comprises more than about 90% by weight oligosaccharides on a dry solids basis as well as a minor amount of monosaccharides; (3) hydrogenating the oligosaccharide-rich stream to convert at least some of the monosaccharides therein to alcohols, thereby producing a hydrogenated oligosaccharide-rich stream; (4) contacting the oligosaccharide-rich stream with a glucosidase enzyme to create a reversion product such that at least some of any residual monosaccharides present in the stream are covalently bonded to oligosaccharides or other monosaccharides; and (5) reducing the color of the oligosaccharide-rich stream by contacting it with activated carbon. Another aspect of the invention is a process for preparing saccharide oligomers. The saccharide oligomer composition produced by some embodiments of this process is primarily digestion resistant. In other embodiment, the composition is primarily slowly digestible. The process uses an aqueous feed composition that comprises at least one monosaccharide or linear saccharide oligomer, and that has a solids concentration of at least about 70% by weight. The feed composition is heated to a temperature of at least about 40°C, and is contacted with at least one catalyst that accelerates the rate of cleavage or formation of glucosyl bonds for a time sufficient to cause formation of non-linear saccharide oligomers. A product composition is produced that contains a higher concentration of non-linear saccharide oligomers than linear saccharide oligomers. In one embodiment of the process, the at least one catalyst is an enzyme that accelerates the rate of cleavage or formation of glucosyl bonds. In another embodiment of the process, the at least one catalyst is an acid. In some embodiments of the process, acid and enzyme can be used in sequence, with the feed composition first being treated with enzyme and subsequently with acid, or vice versa. Another aspect of the invention is an edible carbohydrate composition (sometimes referred to herein as an oligosaccharide composition) that comprises a major amount of oligosaccharides on a dry solids basis, and that is slowly digestible or resistant to digestion by the human digestive system. This composition can be produced by any of the above-described processes. "Major amount" is used herein to mean at least 50% by weight on a dry solids basis. In one embodiment, the edible carbohydrate composition is produced by a process in which the oligosaccharide rich stream has a solids content not less than 70.0 percent mass/mass (m/m), and a reducing sugar content (dextrose equivalent), expressed as D-glucose, that is not less than 20.0 percent m/m calculated on a dry basis. This embodiment of the composition can be classified as corn syrup under food labeling regulations. In another embodiment, the oligosaccharide rich stream has a solids content not less than 70.0 percent mass/mass (m/m), and reducing sugar content (dextrose equivalent), expressed as D-glucose, less than 20.0 percent m/m calculated on a dry basis. This embodiment can be classified as maltodextrin under food labeling regulations. Another aspect of the invention is an edible carbohydrate composition that comprises a major amount on a dry solids basis (i.e., greater than 50% by weight on a dry solids basis) of linear and non-linear saccharide oligomers, wherein the concentration of non-linear saccharide oligomers is greater than the concentration of linear saccharide oligomers. In some embodiments of the invention, the concentration of non-linear saccharide oligomers in the composition is at least twice as high as the concentration of linear saccharide oligomers. Another embodiment is a carbohydrate composition that comprises linear and non-linear saccharide oligomers, wherein the composition contains about 10-70% by weight fiber on a dry solids basis and has a dextrose equivalence of about 25-65. In some embodiments, the composition contains about 30-40% by weight fiber on a dry solids basis and has a caloric value of about 2.5-3.5 kcal/g. The product of this embodiment can be prepared by a process that comprises: heating an aqueous feed composition that comprises at least one monosaccharide or linear saccharide oligomer, and that has a solids concentration of at least about 70% by weight, to a temperature of at least about 40°C; and contacting the feed composition with at least one catalyst that accelerates the rate of cleavage or formation of glucosyl bonds for a time sufficient to cause formation of non-linear saccharide oligomers, wherein a product composition is produced that (a) contains about 10-70% by weight fiber on a dry solids basis, and (b) has a dextrose equivalence of about 25-65. The at least one catalyst can be an acid, such as citric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or a combination thereof. In one particular embodiment, the acid can be residual acid that is present in the feed composition from previous processing. In another embodiment, the at least one catalyst can be an enzyme that accelerates the rate of cleavage or formation of glucosyl bonds. Alternatively, the composition can be prepared by blending corn syrup (such as, for example, a low sugar syrup derived from corn) with a composition prepared by one or more of the processes described herein. Another aspect of the invention is a method of preparing a food product. The method comprises providing a food composition suitable for combination with a carbohydrate material, and combining the food composition with an edible carbohydrate composition that is slowly digestible or digestion-resistant, as described above. Another aspect of the invention is a food product that comprises an edible carbohydrate composition as described above. The food product can be, for example, a bread, cake, cookie, cracker, extruded snack, soup, frozen dessert, fried food, pasta product, potato product, rice product, corn product, wheat product, dairy product, yogurt, confectionary, hard candy, nutritional bar, breakfast cereal, or beverage. In one embodiment of the invention, the food product is selected from baked foods, breakfast cereal, anhydrous coatings (e.g., ice cream compound coating, chocolate), dairy products, confections, jams and jellies, beverages, fillings, extruded and sheeted snacks, gelatin desserts, snack bars, cheese and cheese sauces, edible and water-soluble films, soups, syrups, sauces, dressings, creamers, icings, frostings, glazes, pet food, tortillas, meat and fish, dried fruit, infant and toddler food, and batters and breadings. The edible carbohydrate composition, which is sometimes referred to herein as an oligosaccharide composition, can be present in the food product for one or more purposes, such as a complete or partial replacement for sweetener solids, or as a source of dietary fiber. Another aspect of the invention is a method of controlling blood glucose in a mammal suffering from diabetes. The method comprises feeding to the mammal a food product as described above in various embodiments. In another aspect of the invention, a carbohydrate composition useful as a reduced calorie bulking agent and as an ingredient in food products is provided which comprises linear saccharide oligomers and non-linear saccharide oligomers, a sugar content of from about 5% to about 25% on a dry weight basis, a content of higher molecular weight polysaccharides sufficiently low such that the carbohydrate composition has a viscosity of less than about 16,000 cP at 100°F and 75% dry solids, and from about 10% to about 70% fiber on a dry solids basis. The aforementioned carbohydrate composition may be prepared by a process comprising blending a fiber-containing syrup and a low sugar syrup. The fiber-containing syrup may be prepared in accordance with any of the above-mentioned processes. The low sugar syrup may, for example, have a total DPI + DP2 content of from about 5% to about 30% by weight on a dry solids basis and little or no content of oligosaccharides having a DP greater than 11 (e.g., not more than about 15% or not more than about 10% by weight on a dry solids basis of DP11+). A still further aspect of the invention provides a carbohydrate composition (useful as a reduced calorie bulking agent and food ingredient) which is a blend of a fiber-containing syrup and a low sugar syrup, wherein the fiber-containing syrup is comprised of linear and non-linear saccharide oligomers and contains from about 10% to about 80% by weight fiber on a dry solids basis and the low sugar syrup has a sugar content of from about 5% to about 30% (or from about 10% to about 25%) by weight on a dry solids basis and has a DP11+ content not greater than about 15% by weight on a dry solids basis. The fiber-containing syrup, provided that it possesses the aforementioned compositional characteristics, may be selected from any of the substances elsewhere referred to herein as "oligosaccharide compositions," edible carbohydrate compositions," "corn syrup fiber (CSF)," "oligomer-rich syrups," "resistant corn syrups (RCS)" and "digestion-resistant oligomer syrups" and may be prepared in accordance with any of the procedures described herein. In this embodiment, the fiber-containing syrup and the low sugar syrup may be present in proportions effective to impart to the carbohydrate composition a sugar content of from about 5% to about 25% on a dry solids basis, a content of higher molecular weight polysaccharides sufficiently low such that the carbohydrate composition has a viscosity of less than about 16,000 cP at 100°F and 75% dry solids, and a fiber content of from about 10% to about 70% on a dry solids basis.

DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS One aspect of the present invention is a process for making a slowly digestible or digestion-resistant carbohydrate composition (e.g., saccharide oligomer composition) that is suitable for use in foods. Both in vitro and in vivo tests can be performed to estimate the rate and extent of carbohydrate digestion in humans. The "Englyst Assay" is an in vitro enzyme test that can be used to estimate the amounts of a carbohydrate ingredient that are rapidly digestible, slowly digestible or resistant to digestion (European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (1992) Volume 46 (Suppl. 2), pages S33-S50). It should be understood that the term "food" is used in a broad sense herein to include a variety of substances that can be ingested by humans, such as beverages and medicinal capsules or tablets. The terms "oligosaccharides" and "saccharide oligomers" are used herein to refer to saccharides comprising at least two saccharide units, for example saccharides having a degree of polymerization ("DP") of about 2-30. For example, a disaccharide has a DP of 2. The term, "viscosity", as used herein, refers to the resistance of a fluid to flow. The viscosity of a syrup is typically affected by temperature and solid concentration. Viscosity is expressed in terms of centipoise (cP) at a given temperature and a given % DS. Viscosity measurements were taken with a ΤΑ Instruments Advanced Rheometer 2000. The instrument was fitted with a concentric cylinder DIN 28mm diameter bob and aluminum cup, and all measurements were taken with a 5920 pm gap distance at a shear rate of 50 s'1. This shear rate was chosen to assure Newtonian flow behaviour with no apparent noise interference. Roughly 20 mL of sample was used for each experimental run, enough to cover the upper surface of the bob without overflowing the cup. A cover for the cup was used during analysis to prevent moisture loss at higher sweep temperatures. The procedure consists of a conditioning step to allow the material to equilibrate at 20°C, a series of steady state flow measurements that started at 20°C and proceeded to 80°C (in increments of 20°C), and a post-experimental cool down step for safe handling. "Glucose syrup" is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono-, di-, and highersaccharides and can be made from any source of starch. The most common sources of glucose syrup are corn, wheat, tapioca and potatoes. According to the FDA (21CFR184.1865), glucose syrup is obtained by partial hydrolysis of starch with safe and suitable acids or enzymes. Depending on the degree of hydrolysis, corn syrup may contain, in addition to glucose, maltose and higher saccharides. A "corn syrup" is a glucose syrup made from corn starch. The functionality of a syrup depends on its composition. Historically, Dextrose Equivalence (DE) has been used to describe the composition of syrups. Dextrose equivalence (DE) is a measure of the amount of reducing sugars present in a syrup, relative to glucose and expressed as a percentage on a dry basis. The DE describes the degree of conversion of starch to dextrose and glucose syrups contain a minimum of 20% reducing sugars (DE>20). The DE gives an indication of the average degree of polymerization (DP) for starch sugars and the rule of thumb is DE χ DP = 120. Syrups with different ranges of DE (20-38, 38-58, 58-73, >73) are commonly produced and sold by the sweetener industry. The term "sugar," as used herein, is defined as the total of carbohydrates with DPI and DP2 (DP1+2). The carbohydrate compositions of syrups typically range from 15 to 99% by weight on a dry solids basis of total mono- and di-saccharides (DP1+2), with the most widely used syrups containing more than 25% total mono- and di-saccharides. Syrups with less than 25% sugars are generally very viscous and not very sweet and their use is therefore somewhat limited in the food industry. The high viscosity of these low sugar syrups make it a challenge to use them due to issues around processing such as high resistance to pumping and high adhesiveness to equipment. The conventional low sugar syrups are also more prone to microbial contamination. In some embodiments of the invention, the aqueous feed composition includes at least one monosaccharide and at least one linear saccharide oligomer, and may contain several of each. In many cases, monosaccharides and oligosaccharides will make up at least about 70% by weight on a dry solids basis of the feed composition. It is generally helpful for the starting material to have as high a concentration of monosaccharides as possible, in order to maximize the yield of the desired oligomers. A high solids concentration tends to drive the equilibrium from hydrolysis toward condensation (reversion), thereby producing higher molecular weight products. Therefore the water content of the starting material is preferably relatively low. For example, in certain embodiments, the feed composition comprises at least about 75% dry solids by weight. ("Dry solids" is sometimes abbreviated herein as "ds.") In some cases, the feed composition comprises about 75 - 90% solids by weight, which will generally give the appearance of a viscous syrup or damp powder at room temperature. Examples of suitable starting materials include, but are not limited to, syrups made by hydrolysis of starch, such as dextrose greens syrup (i.e., recycle stream of mother liquor from dextrose monohydrate crystallization), other dextrose syrups, corn syrup, and solutions of maltodextrin. If the feed composition comprises maltodextrin, the process optionally can also include the steps of hydrolyzing the maltodextrin to form a hydrolyzed saccharide solution and concentrating the hydrolyzed saccharide solution to at least about 70% dry solids to form the feed composition. The concentrating and the contacting of the feed with the catalyst can occur simultaneously, or the concentrating can occur prior to contacting the feed composition with the catalyst. The feed composition is contacted with the at least one catalyst for a period of time that can vary. In some cases, the contacting period will be at least about five hours. In some embodiments of the invention, the feed composition is contacted with the at least one catalyst for about 15-100 hours. In other embodiments, shorter contacting times can be used with higher temperatures, in some cases even less than one hour. In one embodiment of the invention, enzymatic reversion is used to produce nonlinear oligosaccharides. The enzyme can be, for example, one that accelerates the rate of cleavage of alpha 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, or 1-6 glucosyl bonds to form dextrose residues. One suitable example is a glucoamylase enzyme composition, such as a commercial enzyme composition that is denominated as a glucoamylase. It should be understood that such a composition can contain some quantity of enzymes other than pure glucoamylase, and it should not be assumed that it is in fact glucoamylase itself that catalyzes the desired production of nonlinear oligosaccharides. Therefore, the feed composition can be contacted with glucoamylase or any other enzyme that acts on dextrose polymers. The amount of enzyme can suitably be about 0.5 - 2.5℅ by volume of the feed composition. In some embodiments of the process, the feed composition is maintained at about 55 - 75°C during the contacting with the enzyme, or in some cases about 60 - 65°C. At this temperature, depending on the water content, the material will become a liquid, or a mixture of liquid and solid. Optionally, the reaction mixture can be mixed or agitated to distribute the enzyme. The reaction mixture is maintained at the desired temperature for the time necessary to achieve the desired degree of reversion to non-linear oligomers. In some embodiments of the process, the feed composition is contacted with the enzyme for about 20-100 hours prior to inactivation of the enzyme, or in some cases, for about 50-100 hours prior to inactivation. Techniques for inactivating glucoamylase are well known in the field. Alternatively, instead of inactivating the enzyme, it can be separated by membrane filtration and recycled. The resulting composition has a high concentration of non-linear oligosaccharides, such as isomaltose. This product composition contains a higher concentration of non-linear saccharide oligomers than linear saccharide oligomers. In some cases, the concentration of non-linear saccharide oligomers in the final composition is at least twice as high as the concentration of linear saccharide oligomers. Gastrointestinal enzymes readily recognize and digest carbohydrates in which the dextrose units are linked alpha (l->4) ("linear" linkages). Replacing these linkages with alternative linkages (alpha (l->3), alpha (l->6) ("non-linear" linkages) or beta linkages, for example) greatly reduces the ability of gastrointestinal enzymes to digest the carbohydrate. This will allow the carbohydrates to pass on into the small intestines largely unchanged. In some cases, the product composition comprises a minor amount (i.e., less than 50 wt % on a dry solids basis, and usually a much lower concentration) of residual monosaccharides. The process can include the additional step of removing at least some of the residual monosaccharides (and optionally other species as well) from the product composition by membrane filtration, chromatographic fractionation, or digestion via fermentation. The separated monosaccharides can be combined with other process streams, for example for production of dextrose or corn syrup. Alternatively, the separated monosaccharides can be recycled into the feed composition. Another embodiment of the invention is a process that involves acid reversion of monosaccharides. The starting material is the same as described above with respect to the enzyme version of the process. A variety of acids can be used, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments of the process, acid is added to the feed composition in an amount sufficient to make the pH of the feed composition no greater than about 4, or in some cases, in an amount sufficient to make the pH of the feed composition about 1.0 - 2.5, or about 1.5-2.0. In some embodiments, the solids concentration of the feed composition is about 70-90%, the amount of acid added to the feed is about 0.05% 0.25% (w/w) acid solids on syrup dry solids, and the feed composition is maintained at a temperature of about 70-90°C during the contacting with the acid. As in the enzyme version of the process, the reaction conditions are maintained for a time sufficient to produce the desired oligomers, which in some embodiments of the process will be about 4-24 hours. In one particular embodiment, the solids concentration of the feed composition is at least about 80% by weight, acid is added to the feed composition in an amount sufficient to make the pH of the composition about 1.8, and the feed composition is maintained at a temperature of at least about 80°C for about 4-24 hours after it is contacted with the acid. In another particular embodiment, the solids concentration of the feed composition is about 90-100% by weight, and the feed composition is maintained at a temperature of at least about 149°C (300°F) for about 0.1 - 15 minutes after it is contacted with the acid. The acid used to treat the feed can be a combination of phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid (at the same concentrations discussed above). In one particular embodiment, the contacting of the feed composition with the acid takes place in a continuous pipe/flow through reactor. By far the most plentiful glycosidic linkage in starch is the alpha-1,4 linkage, and this is the linkage most commonly broken during acid hydrolysis of starch. But acid-catalyzed reversion (condensation) can take place between any two hydroxyl groups, and, given the large variety of combinations and geometries available, the probability of an alpha-1,4 linkage being formed is relatively small. The human digestive system contains alpha amylases which readily digest the alpha-1,4 linkages of starch and corn syrups. Replacing these linkages with linkages unrecognized by enzymes in the digestive system will allow the product to pass through to the small intestines largely unchanged. The saccharide distributions resulting from acid treatment are believed to be somewhat different than from enzyme treatment. It is believed that these acid-catalyzed condensation products will be less recognizable by the enzymes in the human gut than enzyme-produced products, and therefore less digestible. The acid treatment progresses differently than enzyme treatment. Enzymes rapidly hydrolyze linear oligomers and slowly form non-linear oligomers, whereas with acid the reduction in linear oligomers and the increase in non-linear oligomers occur at comparable rates. Dextrose is formed rapidly by enzymatic hydrolysis of oligomers, and consumed slowly as non-linear condensation products are formed, whereas with acid dextrose concentrations increase slowly. Optionally, enzymatic or acid reversion can be followed by hydrogenation. The hydrogenated product should have lower caloric content than currently available hydrogenated starch hydrolysates. In one embodiment, the hydrogenation can be used to decolorize the product composition without substantially changing its dextrose equivalence (DE). In one version of the process, enzyme and acid can be used sequentially, in any order. For example, the at least one catalyst used in the first treatment can be enzyme, and the product composition can be subsequently contacted with an acid that accelerates the rate of cleavage or formation of glucosyl bonds. Alternatively, the at least one catalyst used in the first treatment can be acid, and the product composition can be subsequently contacted with an enzyme that accelerates the rate of cleavage or formation of glucosyl bonds. In an embodiment of the process in which acid treatment is used first, followed by an enzyme treatment, the acid can be phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, or a combination thereof. In this embodiment, after being contacted with the enzyme, the composition can be contacted with an ion exchange resin. After being contacted with the ion exchange resin, the concentration in the composition of saccharide oligomers having a degree of polymerization of at least three can be at least about 50% by weight on a dry solids basis. The product composition produced by the treatment with acid, enzyme, or both, has an increased concentration on a dry solids basis of non-linear saccharide oligomers. In some cases, the concentration of non-linear saccharide oligomers having a degree of polymerization of at least three (DP3+) in the product composition is at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, or at least about 50% by weight on a dry solids basis. In some embodiments, the concentration of non-linear saccharide oligomers in the product composition is at least twice as high as the concentration of linear saccharide oligomers. In one particular embodiment, the concentration of non-linear saccharide oligomers in the product composition is at least about 90% by weight on a dry solids basis, and the concentration of isomaltose is at least about 70% by weight on a dry solids basis. The product composition will often contain some quantity (typically less than 50% by weight on a dry solids basis, and often much less) of residual monosaccharides. Optionally, at least some of the residual monosaccharides (and other species) can be separated from the oligomers (for example, by membrane filtration, chromatographic separation, or digestion via fermentation) and the monosaccharide stream can be recycled into the process feed. In this way, simple sugar syrups can be converted to high-value food additives. The oligomer-rich syrup produced by the processes described herein can be used in foods to increase dietary fiber. The syrup contains naturally-occurring oligosaccharides that have both low viscosity and low glycemic index. Many of these oligomers will comprise at least one non-alpha-1,4 linkage. They should be highly fermentable in the large intestine, which give them added health benefits as prebiotics. In some embodiments of the invention, at least about 50% by weight on a dry solids basis of the product composition is slowly digestible. The beneficial effects of oligosaccharides as dietary fiber have been well documented. Sugar oligomers that resist digestion in the small intestine but are fermentable in the large intestine have been shown to have several beneficial effects, such as reducing cholesterol, attenuating blood dextrose, and maintaining gastrointestinal health. In one embodiment, the product is a carbohydrate composition that comprises linear and non-linear saccharide oligomers, contains about 10-70% by weight fiber on a dry solids basis, and has a dextrose equivalence (DE) of about 25-65. Fiber content can be measured by AOAC method 2001.03. In this embodiment, the product can have an intermediate fiber content (i.e., higher than conventional corn syrup but lower than some of the compositions of the present invention that are described herein). When the feed is derived from corn, the product can be referred to as corn syrup fiber (CSF). In one embodiment, the CSF product contains about 30-40% by weight fiber on a dry solids basis and has a caloric value of about 2.5-3.5 kcal/g. We estimate that a 35% fiber CSF will result in a caloric content of 3 kcal/g, which is intermediate between a high fiber resistant corn syrup at 2 kcai/g and typical digestible carbohydrate at 4 kcal/g. This represents a caloric reduction of 25% compared to traditional sugars and starches. In one embodiment, the process for making this product comprises (1) heating an aqueous feed composition that comprises at least one monosaccharide or linear saccharide oligomer, and that has a solids concentration of at least about 70% by weight, to a temperature of at least about 40°C, and (2) contacting the feed composition with at least one catalyst that accelerates the rate of cleavage or formation of glucosyl bonds for a time sufficient to cause formation of non-linear saccharide oligomers, wherein a product composition is produced that (a) contains about 10-70% by weight fiber on a dry solids basis, and (b) has a dextrose equivalence of about 25-65. The catalyst can be acid (such as citric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or a combination thereof), enzyme, or a combination of both acid and enzyme. The catalyst can be added during the process. Alternatively, in some situations there can be sufficient residual catalyst (e.g., food grade acid) present in the feed as a result of previous processing, so that no further catalyst needs to be added. Thus, in one embodiment, the process to make CSF comprises a simple heating step, with optional addition of food grade acid. This process can be easily implemented and integrated into existing corn syrup refinery operations. We expect that the fiber fraction of this "direct reversion" CSF product will be lower molecular weight, have less complicated branching and will be more easily fermentable by colonic microbiota than the fiber fraction in the higher fiber resistant corn syrup (RCS). The DE of the CSF product can be targeted to match the DE of commercial corn syrup products. For example, CSF products with DE approximately equal to 26, 35, 43 and 63 would be matches for Staley® 200, Staley® 300, Staley® 1300 and Sweetose® 4300 traditional corn syrups, respectively. Alternatively, the product can be prepared by blending conventional corn syrup (having little or no fiber) with a resistant corn syrup (having a fiber content of, for example, about 70% or greater). Syrups that are derived from grains other than corn can also be used. One embodiment of the invention provides a fiber-containing carbohydrate composition having both a low sugar content and a low viscosity which is useful as a reduced calorie bulking agent. Such a carbohydrate composition may comprise linear saccharide oligomers and non-linear saccharide oligomers, a sugar content (total DPI + DP2 content) of from about 5% to about 25% by weight on a dry solids basis, a content of higher molecular weight polysaccharides sufficiently low such that the carbohydrate composition has a viscosity of less than about 16,000 cP at 100°F and 75% dry solids, and from about 10% to about 70% fiber on a dry solids basis. The carbohydrate composition may contain about 25 to about 40% fiber on a dry solids basis. The dextrose equivalence (DE) of the carbohydrate composition may be from about 23 to about 30. The carbohydrate composition may, in one embodiment, comprise about 10% to about 17% sugar (DPI + DP2) on a dry solids basis. In another embodiment, the carbohydrate composition may have a viscosity of less than about 7,000 cP at 100°F and 75% dry solids. The carbohydrate composition may, in certain embodiments of the invention, have a caloric value less than that of a conventional corn syrup (i.e., a caloric value of less than about 4 kcal/g, as determined on a dry solids basis). The caloric value of the carbohydrate composition will depend upon its fiber content and may, for example, be at least about 10%, at least about 20%, or at least about 30% lower than the caloric content of a conventional corn syrup. In one particular embodiment, the carbohydrate composition contains about 30% to about 40% by weight fiber on a dry solids basis and has a caloric value of from about 2.5 to about 3.5 kcal/g. In still another embodiment, the carbohydrate composition may have a DE of from about 23 to about 30 and a viscosity of less than about 7,000 cP at 100°F and 75% dry solids and comprise about 25 to about 40% fiber on a dry solids basis and about 10% to about 17% sugar on a dry solids basis. The aforementioned carbohydrate composition may be prepared by blending a fiber-containing syrup and a low sugar syrup. Such carbohydrate compositions typically will have dry solids contents of from about 65% to about 85% by weight and thus be in the form of syrups. However, the blend obtained by combining the fiber-containing syrup and the low sugar syrup may be dried to provide the carbohydrate composition in dry particulate form, for example. The fiber-containing syrup may be comprised of linear and non-linear saccharide oligomers and contain from about 10% to about 80% fiber on a dry solids basis. Fiber-containing syrups suitable for such purpose may be made by any of the processes described herein. In particular, the fiber-containing syrup may be prepared by a process comprising heating an aqueous feed composition that comprises at least one monosaccharide or linear saccharide oligomer, and that has a solids concentration of at least about 70% by weight, to a temperature of at least about 40°C (alternatively, at least about 60°C, at least about 80°C or at least about 100°C) and contacting the feed composition with at least one catalyst that accelerates the rate of cleavage or formation of glucosyl bonds for a time sufficient to cause formation of non-linear saccharide oligomers, wherein a product composition is produced that contains about 10% to about 70% by weight fiber on a dry solids basis and has a dextrose equivalence (DE) of from about 20 to about 35. The low sugar syrup to be blended with the fiber-containing syrup may suitably be any syrup having a content of mono- and disaccharides of not more than about 30% by weight on a dry solids basis and a relatively low content of higher molecular weight polysaccharides, such that the low sugar syrup has a favorably low viscosity. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the low sugar syrup is a syrup comprising water and saccharides, the saccharides having a saccharide distribution so as to provide a DPI + DP2 content of about 10% to about 30% (or, alternatively, about 10% to about 25%), a DP3-11 content of about 70% to about 90%, and a DP11+ content of 0% to about 15%. Advantageously, the low sugar syrup has a viscosity of not more than about 16,000 cP at 100°F when the syrup has a dry solids content of 75% or not more than about 1500 poise at 20°C when the syrup has a dry solids content of 80%. In other embodiments, the saccharides have a saccharide distribution so as to provide a DP11+ content of not more than 10% or not more than 5%. The low sugar syrup may have a DE of from about 20 to about 35. Typically, the low sugar syrup to be blended with the fiber-containing syrup has a dry solids content of from about 65% to about 85% by weight. In one particular embodiment, the low sugar syrup comprises water and saccharides, the saccharides having a saccharide distribution of DPI 1-4%; DP2 10-15%; DP3 9-13%; DP4 7-11%; DP5 6-10%; DP6 13-19%; DP7 12-17%; DP8 4-7%; DP9 3-7%; DP10 2-6%; DP11 7-15%; DP11+ 0-4%, the total equaling 100%. The low sugar syrup typically has a relatively low fiber content, e.g., a fiber content of less than about 10% or less than about 5% on a dry solids basis. The low sugar syrup may be produced by contacting a starch or starchy material such as corn starch with a first alpha amylase enzyme in an aqueous medium for a time effective to hydrolyze the starch or starchy material to provide a reaction product having a saccharide distribution having a DPI + DP2 content of about 10% to about 30% (or about 10% to about 25%), a DP3-11 content of about 70% to about 90%, and a DP11+ content of 0% to about 15%. The first alpha amylase enzyme may be a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid having at least 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or more, or complete (100%) sequence identity to GenBank Accession No. AF504065 or an amino acid sequence comprising an enzymatically active fragment of said polypeptide. In one suitable method, a slurry of the starch or starchy material, aqueous medium and first alpha amylase enzyme is initially jet cooked at a first temperature of from about 100°C (212°F) to about 115°C (239 °F) and then maintained at a second temperature of from about 80°C (176 °F) to about 95°C (203 °F) for a time effective to provide the desired reaction product. Preferably, the only type of enzyme used in the method of producing the low sugar syrup is alpha amylase, in particular an alpha amylase in accordance with the above-mentioned description. Methods of preparing low sugar syrups suitable for use in the present invention are described, for example, in U.S. published Patent Application No. 2013/0197104, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes. The fiber-containing syrup and the low sugar syrup are blended together in amounts effective to yield a blended carbohydrate composition having the desired combination of characteristics, in particular, a desired sugar (DPI + DP2) content, a desired fiber content and a desired viscosity. Increasing the proportion of low sugar syrup typically will lower the sugar content and viscosity of the resulting blend, while increasing the proportion of fiber-containing syrup typically will increase the fiber content of the blend. Generally speaking, however, the fiber-containing syrup and the low sugar syrup may be blended in a weight ratio of from about 10:90 to about 50:50 fiber-containing syrupdow sugar syrup. The above-described product can be used as an ingredient in food products, as explained in more detail in other parts of this patent application (the blend or admixture of fiber-containing syrup and low sugar syrup may be utilized in the same way and for the same applications as is described herein for the fiber-containing syrup by itself). This product can have one or more benefits. For example, it can reduce the caloric content and increase the dietary fiber content of corn syrup, it can serve as a "drop in" replacement for traditional corn syrup in foods, it can provide appropriate fiber loading in products that use high levels of corn syrup, and it can provide a more economical approach to fiber supplementation in food. Figure 1 shows one embodiment of a process which can make use of the reversion technique described above. The process can begin with a starch, for example a vegetable starch. Conventional corn starch is one suitable example. The process will generally operate more efficiently if the beginning starch has a relatively high purity. In one embodiment, the high purity starch contains less than 0.5% protein on a dry solids basis. Although some of the following discussion focuses on corn, it should be understood that the present invention is also applicable to starches derived from other sources, such as potato and wheat, among others. As shown in Figure 1, the starch 10 can have acid 12 added to it and can then be gelatinized 14 in a starch cooker, for example in a jet cooker in which starch granules are contacted with steam. In one version of the process, the starch slurry, adjusted to a pH target of 3.5 by addition of sulfuric acid, is rapidly mixed with steam in a jet cooker and held at 149 to 152 °C (300 to 305 °F) for 4 minutes in a tail line. The gelatinized starch 16 is hydrolyzed 18 by exposure to acid at high temperature during jet cooking. The hydrolysis reduces the molecular weight of the starch and generates an increased percentage of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides in the composition. (As mentioned above, the term "oligosaccharides" is used herein to refer to saccharides comprising at least two saccharide units, for example saccharides having a degree of polymerization (DP) of about 2-30.) A neutralizing agent 20, such as sodium carbonate, can be added to stop the acid hydrolysis, and then the composition can be further depolymerized 24 by contacting it with a hydrolytic enzyme 22. Suitable enzymes include alpha amylases such as Termamyl®, which is available from Novozymes. This enzymatic hydrolysis further increases the percentage of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides present in the composition. The overall result of the hydrolysis by acid and enzyme treatment is to saccharify the starch. The saccharified composition can be isomerized to change the monosaccharide profile, for example to increase the concentration of fructose. The saccharified composition 26 can then be purified, for example by chromatographic fractionation 28. In one embodiment that employs a sequential simulated moving bed (SSMB) chromatography procedure, a solution of mixed saccharides is pumped through a column filled with resin beads. Depending on the chemical nature of the resin, some of the saccharides interact with the resin more strongly leading to a retarded flow through the resin compared to saccharides that interact with the resin more weakly. This fractionation can produce one stream 30 that has a high content of monosaccharides, such as dextrose and fructose. High fructose corn syrup is an example of such a stream. The fractionation also produces a raffinate stream 32 (i.e., faster moving components through the resin bed) that has a relatively high concentration of oligosaccharides (e.g., about 5-15 % oligosaccharides on a dry solids basis (d.s.b.)) and also contains a smaller concentration of monosaccharides such as dextrose and fructose. Although the term "stream" is used herein to describe certain parts of the process, it should be understood that the process of the present invention is not limited to continuous operation. The process can also be performed in batch or semi-batch mode. The raffinate 32 can be further fractionated by membrane filtration 34, for example by nanofiltration, optionally with diafiltration. For example, these filtration steps can be performed using a Desal DK spiral wound nanofiltration cartridge at about 500 psi of pressure and at 40 - 60 degrees centigrade temperature. The fractionation described in step 34 could also be accomplished by sequential simulated moving bed chromatography (SSMB). The membrane filtration produces a permeate 36 (i.e., components that pass through the membrane) which comprises primarily monosaccharides, and a retentate 38 (i.e., components rejected by the membrane) which comprises primarily oligosaccharides. ("Primarily" as used herein means that the composition contains more of the listed component than of any other component on a dry solids basis.) The permeate 36 can be combined with the monomer stream 30 (e.g., high fructose corn syrup). The permeate is a monosaccharide-rich stream and the retentate is an oligosaccharide-rich stream. In other words, the nanofiltration concentrates the oligosaccharides in the retentate and the monosaccharides in the permeate, relative to the nanofiltration feed. The retentate 38, which can be described as an oligosaccharide syrup 40, can have a sufficiently high content of oligosaccharides that are slowly digestible (e.g., at least about 50% by weight d.s.b., or in some cases at least about 90%) so that it can be dried or simply evaporated to a concentrated syrup and used as an ingredient in foods. However, in many cases, it will be useful to further process and purify this composition. Such purification can include one or more of the following steps. (Although Fig. 1 shows four such purification steps 42, 44, 46, and 48 as alternatives, it should be understood that two or more of these steps could be used in the process.) The oligomers syrup 40 can be subjected to another fractionation 42, such as a membrane filtration, for example a second nanofiltration, in order to remove at least some of the residual monosaccharides, such as fructose and dextrose. Suitable nanofiltration conditions and equipment are as described above. This nanofiltration produces a permeate, which is a second monosaccharide-rich stream, which can be combined with the monomer stream 30. Alternatively, the further fractionation 42 could be done by chromatographic separation, for example, by simulated mixed-bed chromatography. The syrup 41 can be isomerized 44 by contacting it with an enzyme such as dextrose isomerase. This will convert at least some of the residual dextrose present into fructose, which may be more valuable in certain situations. As mentioned above, the syrup can be treated with an enzyme or acid to cause reversion or repolymerization 46, in which at least some of the monosaccharides that are still present are covalently bonded to other monosaccharides or to oligosaccharides, thereby reducing the residual monomer content of the syrup even further. Suitable enzymes for use in this step include glucosidases, such as amylase, glucoamylase, transglucosidase, and pullulanase. Cellulase enzymes may produce valuable reversion products for some applications. The syrup can be hydrogenated 48 to convert at least some of any residual monosaccharides to the corresponding alcohols (e.g., to convert dextrose to sorbitol). When hydrogenation is included in the process, it will typically (but not necessarily) be the final purification step. The purified oligomer syrup 49 produced by one or more of the above purification steps can then be decolorized 50. Decolorization can be done by treatment with activated carbon followed by microfiltration, for example. In continuous flow systems, syrup streams can be pumped through columns filled with granular activated carbon to achieve decolorization. The decolorized oligomer syrup can then be evaporated 52, for example to about greater than about 70% dry solids (d.s.), giving a product that comprises a high content of oligosaccharides (e.g., greater than 90% by wt d.s.b., and in some instances greater than 95%), and a correspondingly low monosaccharide content. The product comprises a plurality of saccharides which are slowly or incompletely digested by humans, if not totally indigestible. These sugars can include isomaltose, panose and branched oligomers having a degree of polymerization of four or greater. The process conditions can be modified to recover the majority of the maltose in the feed either in the monomer-rich streams (30, 36) or in the oligomer product stream. For example, a nanofiltration membrane with a slightly more open pore size, such as Desal DL, operating at less than 500 psi pressure can be used to increase the amount of maltose in monomer-rich streams. The product is suitable as an ingredient for foods, and is slowly digestible or resistant to digestion by the human digestive system. As mentioned above, some components of the product can be substantially entirely indigestible in the human stomach and small intestine. Depending on the starch source used, the product can be classified in some embodiments as corn syrup or wheat syrup, as those terms are used in food labeling. In cases where more open pore sizes are used in nanofiltration, a higher molecular weight oligomer syrup product classified as a maltodextrin can be obtained. The oligosaccharide-containing syrup produced by the process (sometimes referred to herein as a digestion-resistant syrup or a fiber-containing syrup) can be added to foods as replacement or supplement for conventional carbohydrates (in one embodiment of the invention, in admixture with a low sugar syrup). Thus, another aspect of the invention is a food product that comprises a carbohydrate composition that comprises a major amount on a dry solids basis of linear and non-linear saccharide oligomers, wherein the concentration of non-linear saccharide oligomers is greater than the concentration of linear saccharide oligomers. Specific examples of foods in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (or its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used include processed foods such as bread, cakes, cookies, crackers, extruded snacks, soups, frozen desserts, fried foods, pasta products, potato products, rice products, corn products, wheat products, dairy products, yogurts, confectionaries, hard candies, nutritional bars, breakfast cereals, and beverages. A food product containing the oligosaccharide syrup will have a lower glycemic response, lower glycemic index, and lower glycemic load than a similar food product in which a conventional carbohydrate, such as corn starch, is used. Further, because at least some of the oligosaccharides are either only digested to a very limited extent or are not digested at all in the human stomach or small intestine, the caloric content of the food product is reduced. The syrup is also a source of soluble dietary fiber. The digestion-resistant oligomer syrup described above (optionally in admixture with a low sugar syrup, as described elsewhere herein) can be used as an ingredient in food products as a syrup, or it can first be concentrated to form syrup solids. In either form, it can be used in a number of ways. As mentioned above, this syrup can be derived from various starch sources, such as corn. In some instances in this patent, the phrase "digestion-resistant corn syrup" or "resistant corn syrup" (sometimes abbreviated as "RCS") will be used, but it should be understood that the invention is not limited to syrups or syrup solids that are derived from corn. The digestion-resistant oligomer syrup (in admixture with a low sugar syrup, in one embodiment of the invention) can be added to food products as a source of soluble fiber. It can increase the fiber content of food products without having a negative impact on flavor, mouth feel, or texture. The functionality of the digestion-resistant oligomer syrup (and its admixtures with the low sugar syrups described herein) is similar to corn syrup and sugar, which makes it suitable for complete or partial replacement of various nutritive sweeteners in food products. For example, the resistant syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used for total or partial replacement of sucrose, high fructose corn syrup (FIFCS), fructose, dextrose, regular corn syrup, or corn syrup solids in food products. As one particular example, the digestion-resistant syrup or digestion-resistant syrup solids can be used to replace other sweetener solids on a 1:1 basis, up to a complete replacement of the sugar solids. At high sweetener solids replacement levels, the sweetness of the food product could be decreased, but mouth feel and flavor release would remain substantially the same, while sugar and calorie content would be reduced. Also, the digestion-resistant syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) could be used as a bulking agent, replacing fat, flour, or other ingredients in a food formula. Alternatively, the digestion-resistant syrup (or its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used in food products in combination with sweeteners such as sucrose, HFCS, or fructose, resulting in no change in overall sweetness of the food product. As another example, the digestion-resistant syrup can be used in food products in combination with sucralose or other high intensity sweeteners (including both natural and synthetic high intensity sweeteners), which allows sweetener replacement with no change in sweetness or mouth feel of the food product. The digestion-resistant oligomer syrup (including as an admixture with a low sugar syrup) can be used in food products in combination with resistant starch, polydextrose, or other fiber sources, to boost the fiber content of the food product, enhance physiological benefit from consumption of the product, reduce the caloric content, and/or enhance the nutritional profile of the product. The digestion-resistant oligomer syrup (and its blends with a low sugar syrup) can be used in food products in combination with bulking agents, such as sugar alcohols or maltodextrins, to reduce caloric content and/or to enhance nutritional profile of the product. The syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can also be used as a partial replacement for fat in food products. The digestion-resistant oligomer syrup (and its low sugar syrup admixtures) can be used in food products as a tenderizer or texturizer, to increase crispness or snap, to improve eye appeal, and/or to improve the rheology of dough, batter, or other food compositions. The syrup can also be used in food products as a humectant, to increase product shelf life, and/or to produce a softer, moister texture. It can also be used in food products to reduce water activity or to immobilize and manage water. Additional uses of the syrup include: to replace egg wash and/or to enhance the surface sheen of a food product, to alter flour starch gelatinization temperature, to modify the texture of the product, and to enhance browning of the product. At least in some embodiments of the invention, the digestion-resistant oligomer syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) has one or more of the following advantages: high solubility, which makes it relatively easy to incorporate into food compositions, such as batters and doughs; stability under elevated temperatures and/or acidic pH (some other soluble fibers, such as inulin, are not as stable), lower sweetness, clean flavor, and clear color. The properties of the syrup (and those of its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) allow food products in which it is used to have a clean label. In some embodiments of the invention, the digestion-resistant oligomer syrup contains about 2 calories per gram (d.s.b.), which can reduce the total calorie content of a food product. The digestion-resistant oligomer syrup of the present invention (including admixtures of the digestion-resistant oligomer syrup and a low sugar syrup, as described elsewhere herein) can be used in a variety of types of food products. One type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup and its low sugar syrup admixtures can be very useful is bakery products (i.e., baked foods), such as cakes, brownies, cookies, cookie crisps, muffins, breads, and sweet doughs. Conventional bakery products can be relatively high in sugar and high in total carbohydrates. The use of the digestion-resistant syrup and its low sugar syrup admixtures as an ingredient in bakery products can help lower the sugar and carbohydrate levels, as well as reduce the total calories, while increasing the fiber content of the bakery product. There are two main categories of bakery products: yeast-raised and chemicallyleavened. In yeast-raised products, like donuts, sweet doughs, and breads, the digestion-resistant oligomer syrup (and its admixtures with low sugar syrup) can be used to replace sugars, but a small amount of sugar may still be desired due to the need for a fermentation substrate for the yeast or for crust browning. Digestion-resistant oligomer syrup solids (e.g., digestion-resistant corn syrup solids) could be added in a manner similar to nutritive dry sweeteners, with other dry ingredients, and would require no special handling. The resistant corn syrup can be added with other liquids (including a low sugar syrup) as a direct replacement for syrups or liquid sweeteners. The dough would then be processed under conditions commonly used in the baking industry including being mixed, fermented, divided, formed or extruded into loaves or shapes, proofed, and baked or fried. The product can be baked or fried using conditions similar to traditional products. Breads are commonly baked at temperatures ranging from 420°F to 520°F for 20 to 23 minutes and doughnuts can be fried at temperatures ranging from 400 - 415°F, although other temperatures and times could also be used. High intensity sweeteners can be added to doughs as required to obtain optimum sweetness and flavor profile. Chemically leavened products typically have more sugar and may contain have a higher level of resistant corn syrup/solids. A finished cookie can contain 30% sugar, which could be replaced, entirely or partially, with resistant corn syrup/solids. These products could have a pH of 4-9.5, for example. The moisture content can be between 2-40%, for example. The resistant corn syrup/solids is readily incorporated and may be added to the fat at the beginning of mixing during a creaming step or in a any method similar to the syrup or dry sweetener that it is being used to replace. The product would be mixed and then formed, for example by being sheeted, rotary cut, wire cut, or through another forming process. The products would then be baked under typical baking conditions, for example at 200-450°F. The resistant corn syrup/solids can also be used to form sugar glasses in the amorphous state, to adhere particles to baked goods, and/or used to form a film or coating which enhances the appearance of a baked good. Resistant corn syrup solids, like other amorphous sugars, form glasses with heating and subsequent cooling to a temperature below their glass transition temperature. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup can be used (including as an admixture with a low sugar syrup) is breakfast cereal. For example, resistant corn syrup in accordance with the present invention could be used to replace all or part of the sugar in extruded cereal pieces and/or in the coating on the outside of those pieces. The coating is typically 30-60% of the total weight of the finished cereal piece. The syrup can be applied in a spray or drizzled on, for example. The formula for the coating can be as simple as a 75% solution of resistant corn syrup. The resistant corn syrup could also be blended with sugar at various percentages, or with other sweeteners or polyols. The extra moisture could then be evaporated in a low heat oven. In an extruded piece, the resistant corn syrup solids could be added directly with the dry ingredients, or the syrup form could be metered into the extruder with water or separately. A small amount of water could be added in the extruder, and then it could pass through various zones ranging from 100°F to 300°F. Optionally, other sources of fiber such as resistant starch can be used in the extruded piece. Using the resistant corn syrup would create a different texture than other fiber sources. Using it alone or in combination with other fibers may alter the texture to create product diversity. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with low sugar syrups) can be used is dairy products. Examples of dairy products in which it can be used include yogurt, yogurt drinks, milk drinks, flavored milks, smoothies, ice cream, shakes, cottage cheese, cottage cheese dressing, and dairy desserts, such as quarg and the whipped mousse-type products. This would include dairy products that are intended to be consumed directly (e.g., packaged smoothies) as well as those that are intended to be blended with other ingredients (e.g., blended smoothie). It can be used in pasteurized dairy products, such as ones that are pasteurized at a temperature from 160°F to 285°F. Complete replacement of sugars in a dairy product is possible (which would be up to 24% of the total formula). The resistant corn syrup is generally stable at acid pH's (the pH range of dairy beverages typically would be 2-8). Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with low sugar syrups) can be used is confections. Examples of confections in which it can be used include hard candies, fondants, nougats and marshmallows, gelatin jelly candies or gummies, jellies, chocolate, licorice, chewing gum, caramels and toffees, chews, mints, tableted confections, and fruit snacks. In fruit snacks, the resistant corn syrup could be used in combination with fruit juice. The fruit juice would provide the majority of the sweetness, and the resistant corn syrup would reduce the total sugar content and add fiber. The syrup can be added to the initial candy slurry and heated to the finished solids content. The slurry could be heated from 200-305°F to achieve the finished solids content. Acid could be added before or after heating to give a finished pH of 2-7. The resistant corn syrup could be used as a replacement for 0-100% of the sugar and 1-100% of the corn syrup or other sweeteners present. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with low sugar syrups) can be used is jams and jellies. Jams and jellies are made from fruit. A jam contains fruit pieces, while jelly is made from fruit juice. The resistant corn syrup can be used in place of sugar or other sweeteners as follows: Weigh fruit and juice into a tank. Premix sugar, resistant corn syrup and pectin. Add the dry composition to the liquid and cook to a temperature of 214-220°F. Hot fill into jars and retort for 5-30 minutes. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with low sugar syrups) can be used is beverages. Examples of beverages in which it can be used include carbonated beverages, fruit juices, concentrated juice mixes (e.g., margarita mix), clear waters, and beverage dry mixes. The use of the resistant corn syrup of the present invention would in many cases overcome the clarity problems that result when other types of fiber are added to beverages. A complete replacement of sugars is possible (which could be, for example, up to 12% of the total formula). Because of the stability of the syrup at acid pHs, it could be used in beverages having pH ranging from 2-7, for example. The resistant corn syrup could be used in cold processed beverages and in pasteurized beverages. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with low sugar syrups) can be used is high solids fillings. Examples of high solids fillings in which it can be used include fillings in snack bars, toaster pastries, donuts, and cookies. The high solids filling could be an acid/fruit filling or a savory filling, for example. It could be added to products that would be consumed as is, or products that would undergo further processing, by a food processor (additional baking) or by a consumer (bake stable filling). In some embodiments of the invention, the high solids fillings would have a solids concentration between 67-90%. The solids could be entirely replaced with resistant corn syrup, or it could be used for a partial replacement of the other sweetener solids present (e.g., replacement of current solids from 5-100%). Typically fruit fillings would have a pH of 2-6, while savory fillings would be between 4-8 pH. Fillings could be prepared cold, or heated at up to 250°F to evaporate to the desired finished solids content. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with low sugar syrups) can be used is extruded and sheeted snacks. Examples of extruded and sheeted snacks in which it can be used include puffed snacks, crackers, tortilla chips, and corn chips. In preparing an extruded piece, the resistant corn syrup/solids would be added directly with the dry products. A small amount of water would be added in the extruder, and then it would pass through various zones ranging from 100°F to 300°F. This dry resistant corn syrup/solids could be added at levels from 0-50% of the dry products mixture. The liquid resistant corn syrup could also be added at one of the liquid ports along the extruder. The product would come out at either a low moisture content (5%) and then baked to remove the excess moisture, or at a slightly higher moisture content (10%) and then fried to remove moisture and cook out the product. Baking could be at temperatures up to 500°F for 20 minutes. Baking would more typically be at 350°F for 10 minutes. Frying would typically be at 350°F for 2-5 minutes. In a sheeted snack, the resistant corn syrup solids could be used as a partial replacement of the other dry ingredients (e.g., flour). It could be from 0-50% of the dry weight. The product would be dry mixed, and then water added to form cohesive dough. The product mix could have a pH from 5 to 8. The dough would then be sheeted and cut and then baked or fried. Baking could be at temperatures up to 500°F for 20 minutes. Frying would typically be at 350°F for 2-5 minutes. Another potential benefit from the use of the resistant corn syrup is a reduction of the fat content of fried snacks by as much as 15% when it is added as an internal ingredient or as a coating on the outside of a fried food. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with low sugar syrups) can be used is gelatin desserts. The ingredients for gelatin desserts are often sold as a dry mix with gelatin as a gelling agent. The sugar solids could be replaced partially or entirely with resistant corn syrup solids in the dry mix. The dry mix can then be mixed with water and heated to 212°F to dissolve the gelatin and then more water and/or fruit can be added to complete the gelatin dessert. The gelatin is then allowed to cool and set. Gelatin can also be sold in shelf stable packs. In that case the stabilizer is usually carrageenan-based. As stated above, resistant corn syrup can replace up to 100% of the other sweetener solids. The dry ingredients are mixed into the liquids and then pasteurized and put into cups and allowed to cool and set. The cups usually have a foil top. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with low sugar syrups) can be used is snack bars. Examples of snack bars in which it can be used include breakfast and meal replacement bars, nutrition bars, granola bars, protein bars, and cereal bars. It could be used in any part of the snack bars, such as in the high solids filling, the binding syrup or the particulate portion. A complete or partial replacement of sugar in the binding syrup is possible with the resistant corn syrup. The binding syrup is typically from 50-90% solids and applied at a ratio ranging from 10% binding syrup to 90% particulates, to 70% binding syrup to 30% particulates. The binding syrup is made by heating a solution of sweeteners, bulking agents and other binders (like starch) to 160-230°F (depending on the finished solids needed in the syrup). The syrup is then mixed with the particulates to coat the particulates, providing a coating throughout the matrix. The resistant corn syrup could also be used in the particulates themselves. This could be an extruded piece, directly expanded or gun puffed. It could be used in combination with another grain ingredient, corn meal, rice flour or other similar ingredient. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with low sugar syrups) can be used is cheese, cheese sauces, and other cheese products. Examples of cheese, cheese sauces, and other cheese products in which it can be used include lower milk solids cheese, lower fat cheese, and calorie reduced cheese. In block cheese, it can help to improve the melting characteristics, or to decrease the effect of the melt limitation added by other ingredients such as starch. It could also be used in cheese sauces, for example as a bulking agent, to replace fat, milk solids, or other typical bulking agents. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup/solids (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used is films that are edible and/or water soluble. Examples of films in which it can be used include films that are used to enclose dry mixes for a variety of foods and beverages that are intended to be dissolved in water, or films that are used to deliver color or flavors such as a spice film that is added to a food after cooking while still hot. Other film applications include, but are not limited to, fruit and vegetable leathers, and other flexible films. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used is soups, syrups, sauces, and dressings. A typical dressing could be from 0-50% oil, with a pH range of 2-7. It could be cold processed or heat processed. It would be mixed, and then stabilizer would be added. The resistant corn syrup could easily be added in liquid or dry form with the other ingredients as needed. The dressing composition may need to be heated to activate the stabilizer. Typical heating conditions would be from 170-200°F for 1-30 minutes. After cooling, the oil is added to make a pre-emulsion. The product is then emulsified using a homogenizer, colloid mill, or other high shear process. Sauces can have from 0-10% oil and from 10-50% total solids, and can have a pH from 2-8. Sauces can be cold processed or heat processed. The ingredients are mixed and then heat processed. The resistant corn syrup could easily be added in liquid or dry form with the other ingredients as needed. Typical heating would be from 170-200°F for 1-30 minutes. Soups are more typically 20-50% solids and in a more neutral pH range (4-8). They can be a dry mix, to which the dry resistant corn syrup solids could be added, or a liquid soup which is canned and then retorted. In soups, resistant corn syrup could be used up to 50% solids, though a more typical usage would be to deliver 5 g of fiber/serving. Syrups can incorporate the resistant corn syrup as up to a 100% replacement of the sugar solids. Typically that would be 12-20% of the syrup on an as-is basis. The resistant corn syrup would be added with the water and then pasteurized and hot filled to make the product safe and shelf stable (typically 185°F for one minute pasteurization). Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used is coffee creamers. Examples of coffee creamers in which it can be used include both liquid and dry creamers. A dry blended coffee creamer can be blended with commercial creamer powders of the following fat types: soybean, coconut, palm, sunflower, or canola oil, or butterfat. These fats can be non-hydrogenated or hydrogenated. The resistant corn syrup solids can be added as a fiber source, optionally together with fructo-oligosaccharides, polydextrose, inulin, maltodextrin, resistant starch, sucrose, and/or conventional corn syrup solids. The composition can also contain high intensity sweeteners, such as sucralose, acesuifame potassium, aspartame, or combinations thereof. These ingredients can be dry blended to produce the desired composition. A spray dried creamer powder is a combination of fat, protein and carbohydrates, emulsifiers, emulsifying salts, sweeteners, and anti-caking agents. The fat source can be one or more of soybean, coconut, palm, sunflower, or canola oil, or butterfat. The protein can be sodium or calcium caseinates, milk proteins, whey proteins, wheat proteins, or soy proteins. The carbohydrate can be the resistant corn syrup alone or in combination with fructo-oligosaccharides, polydextrose, inulin, resistant starch, maltodextrin, sucrose, or corn syrup. The emulsifiers can be monoand diglycerides, acetylated mono- and diglycerides, or propylene glycol monoesters. The salts can be trisodium citrate, monosodium phosphate, disodium phosphate, trisodium phosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, monopotassium phosphate, and/or dipotassium phosphate. The composition can also contain high intensity sweeteners, such as sucralose, acesuifame potassium, aspartame, or combinations thereof. Suitable anti-caking agents include sodium silicoaluminates or silica dioxides. The products are combined in slurry, optionally homogenized, and spray dried in either a granular or agglomerated form. Liquid coffee creamers are simply a homogenized and pasteurized emulsion of fat (either dairy fat or hydrogenated vegetable oil), some milk solids or caseinates, corn syrup, and vanilla or other flavors, as well as a stabilizing blend. The product is usually pasteurized via HTST (high temperature short time) at 185° F for 30 seconds, or UHT (ultra-high temperature), at 285° F for 4 seconds, and homogenized in a two stage homogenizer at 500-3000 psi first stage, and 200-1000 psi second stage. The coffee creamer is usually stabilized so that it does not break down when added to the coffee. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used is food coatings such as icings, frostings, and glazes. In icings and frostings, the resistant corn syrup can be used as a sweetener replacement (complete or partial) to lower caloric content and increase fiber content. Glazes are typically about 70-90% sugar, with most of the rest being water, and the resistant corn syrup can be used to entirely or partially replace the sugar. Frosting typically contains about 2-40% of a liquid/solid fat combination, about 20-75% sweetener solids, color, flavor, and water. The resistant corn syrup can be used to replace all or part of the sweetener solids, or as a bulking agent in lower fat systems. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used is pet food, such as dry or moist dog food. Pet foods are made in a variety of ways, such as extrusion, forming, and formulating as gravies. The resistant corn syrup could be used at levels of 0-50% in each of these types. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used is tortillas, which usually contain flour and/or corn meal, fat, water, salt, and fumaric acid. The resistant corn syrup could be used to replace flour or fat. The ingredients are mixed and then sheeted or stamped and cooked. This addition could be used to add fiber or extend the shelf life. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used is fish and meat. Conventional corn syrup is already used in some meats, so the resistant corn syrup can be used as a partial or complete substitute. For example, the resistant corn syrup could be added to brine before it is vacuum tumbled or injected into the meat. It could be added with salt and phosphates, and optionally with water binding ingredients such as starch, carrageenan, or soy proteins. This would be used to add fiber, a typical level would be 5 g/serving which would allow a claim of excellent source of fiber. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used is dried (infused) fruit. Many kinds of dried fruit are only stable and palatable if they are infused with sugar. The resistant corn syrup can be substituted for all or part of the sugar. For example, the resistant corn syrup could be added to the brine used to infuse the fruit before drying. Stabilizing agents such as sulfates can be used in this brine as well. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used is infant and toddler food. The resistant corn syrup could be used as a replacement or a supplement to one or more conventional ingredients for such food. Because of its mild flavor and clear color, it could be added to a variety of baby foods to reduce sugar and increase fiber content. Another type of food product in which the digestion-resistant (fiber-containing) syrup (and its admixtures with a low sugar syrup) can be used is batters and breedings, such as the batters and breedings for meat. This could be done by replacing all or part of the dry components of the batter and/or breading (e.g., flour type ingredients) with the resistant corn syrup, or to use in combination with addition to the meat muscle or fried food itself. This could be used as a bulking agent, for fiber addition, or to reduce fat in the fried food. The process described herein takes advantage of a fraction of the saccharide syrup (e.g., stream 26 in Fig. 1) that is resistant to saccharification. By separating this material as a purified product, it can be employed for its own useful properties, rather than being an undesirable by-product in syrups that are primarily monosaccharides, such as high fructose corn syrup. Removal of a greater percentage of the oligosaccharides from the high fructose corn syrup allows that product to be made purer (i.e., with a higher concentration of dextrose and fructose) and thus more valuable. Food products of the present invention can also be used to help control the blood glucose concentration in mammals, such as humans, that suffer from diabetes. When the food product is consumed by the mammal, the slowly digestible and/or digestion resistant components in the food product can cause a more moderate relative glycemic response in the bloodstream, which can be beneficial for diabetes patients. "Control" in this context should be understood as a relative term; i.e., the glycemic response can be improved relative to that occurring when the same mammal consumes a similar food product that does not contain such digestion-resistant and/or slowly digestible components, although the glycemic response may not necessarily be equivalent to what would be observed in a mammal that does not suffer from diabetes. Certain embodiments of the invention can be further understood from the following examples. Example 1 Raffinate syrup was obtained from a plant in which corn starch was being processed into high fructose corn syrup. The raffinate was produced by a chromatographic separation, and comprised primarily fructose and dextrose. The raffinate was subjected to nanofiltration using a Desal DK1812C-31D nanofiltration cartridge at about 500 psi of pressure and at a temperature of 40-60°C. The retentate from the nanofiltration was decolorized with activated charcoal, and then evaporated to approximately 80% dry solids. A saccharide analysis of the dry product was performed by FIPAE-PAD chromatography, and the results are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Component Wt % d.s.b. dextrose 38.9% fructose 6.1% isomaltose 14.3% maltose 10.5% maltotriose 0.3% panose 9.5% linear higher saccharides 0.0% nonlinear higher saccharides 20.4% This material, termed Light Raffinate, was tested for digestibility using an Englyst assay. About 600 mg of carbohydrate d.s.b. was added to 20 mL of 0.1 Μ sodium acetate buffer in a test tube. The contents were mixed and then heated to about 92 °C for 30 minutes, then cooled to 37 °C. Then 5 mL of enzyme solution was added to the test tube and it was agitated by shaking in a water bath at 37 °C. Small samples were removed at both 20 min and 120 min. The enzyme was inactivated, the samples were filtered and measured for digestibility using a glucose test from YSI Inc. A Heavy Raffinate, processed in a separate but similar nanofiltration operation, was also tested using the same assay. The Heavy Raffinate contained 25-35% dry solids, as opposed to 15-25% dry solids for the Light Raffinate, but both had approximately the same percentage of low molecular weight saccharides. A cooked potato starch, which had not been nanofiltered, was also tested as a comparison. The results of the digestibility assay and a saccharide analysis are shown in Table 2. Cooked potato starch is included in Table 2 for comparison. All percentages in Table 2 are on a d.s.b. material % rapidly digestible % slowly digestible % resistant % monosaccharides (by ΗΡΑΕ) % oligosaccharides (by ΗΡΑΕ) Light raffinate 45 3 52 45 55 Heavy raffinate 41 3 56 44 56 Potato starch (cooked) 78 11 11 44 56 Table 2 There was an excellent correlation between the percentage of oligosaccharides in the material and the percentage of the material that was resistant to digestion. Example 2 About 1,025 L of raffinate syrup at 21.4% dry solids was obtained from a plant in which corn starch was being processed into high fructose corn syrup. The raffinate was produced by a chromatographic separation, and comprised primarily fructose and dextrose. The raffinate was subjected to nanofiltration using two Desal NF3840C-50D nanofiltration cartridges at about 500 psi of pressure and at a temperature of 40-60°C. After the starting volume was reduced by about a factor of 20, the retentate was subjected to about 2 volumes of constant volume diafiltration using DI water. After diafiltration, 27.6 kg of retentate product (at 33.8% ds) was collected. This material was decolorized with activated carbon (0.5% by weight of syrup solids) by stirring in a refrigerator overnight. This slurry was sterilized by filtration through a 0.45 micron hollow fiber filtration cartridge, and evaporated in parts to an average concentration of about 73% ds. A saccharide analysis of the dry product was performed by HPAE-PAD chromatography, and the results are shown in Table 3. Component Wt % d.s.b. dextrose 4.5% fructose 0.9% isomaltose 20.6% maltose 23.5% maltotriose 0.4% panose 20.9% linear hiqher saccharides 0.0% nonlinear higher saccharides 29.1% Table 3 Example 3 - Preparation of non-linear oligomers from dextrose by enzyme. Concentrated dextrose syrups having solids concentrations of 74%, 79.5%, and 80% were prepared by (1) evaporating diluted syrup or (2) adding water to dextrose powder. Each dextrose/water mixture was placed in a suitable container and heated to 60°C in a water bath. Glucoamylase enzyme (Dextrozyme or Spirizyme, from Novozymes A/S) was added to the syrup - approximately 400 pi enzyme to 30 ml syrup. The syrup container was capped, and then shaken vigorously to distribute the enzyme. The syrup was returned to the 60°C water bath. The change in sugar distribution was monitored over time by transferring 2-4 ml syrup to a small glass vial, and heating it in a heated block to approximately 85-90°C to deactivate the enzyme. The concentration of various sugar species was determined by High Performance Anion Exchange with Pulsed Amperometric Detection, (HPAE-PAD). A Dionex ion chromatograph, DX500, equipped with electrochemical detector and gradient pump, was used for the analyses. The sugars were separated on Dionex Carbopac ΡΑ1 analytical and guard columns with gradient delivery of a sodium hydroxide and sodium acetate eluent. The sugars were detected using a gold electrode with a four-potential waveform. Samples were diluted with water and passed through Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices before analysis. Figure 2 illustrates the relative amounts of dextrose, isomaltose and "non-linear highers" (which in this figure refers to nonlinear oligomers having a degree of polymerization of four or more) in syrups of three different initial dextrose compositions treated with 1.3% vol/vol Dextrazyme, a commercial glucoamylase enzyme from Novozymes, for 48 hrs at 60°C. As syrup concentration increased, the amount of monomeric dextrose, relative to other sugars, decreased, and the amount of non-linear higher oligomers increases. Example 4 - Preparation of oligomer syrup from corn syrups. Starting substrates were obtained having a range of extents of conversion, from dextrose greens (95% dextrose) to lightly converted Staley® 200 syrup (26 DE, 5% dextrose) and including high (34%) maltose syrup, Neto® 7300. The specific products used as starting materials in this example were Staley® 200, Staley® 300, Staley® 1300, Neto® 7300, and Sweetose® 4300 corn syrups, and Staleydex® 3370 dextrose. Some of the characteristics of these materials are given in Table 4. Table 4 Characteristics of starting syrups wnne many Staley® 200 Staley® 300 Staley® 1300 Neto® 7300 Sweetose® 4300 Staleydex® 3370 Degree of conversion very low low regular regular high high Type of conversion acidenzyme acid acid acidenzyme acidenzyme acidenzyme Dextrose equivalent (D.E.) % 26 35 43 42 63 95 % dextrose 5 13 19 9 37 90 % maltose 8 10 14 34 29 4 % maltotriose 11 11 13 24 9 2 % higher saccharides 76 66 54 33 25 - higher oligomers having a degree of polymerization of four or more (NL DP 4+), they also have substantial quantities of linear oligomers. Several of these syrups contain measurable linear oligomers up through DP 17. Figure 3 shows the initial saccharide distributions. The enzymes used were Spirizyme Plus FG and Dextrozyme DX 1.5Χ glucoamylases and Promozyme D2 pullulanase (supplied by Novozymes), CG 220 Cellulase and Transglucosidase L-500 (supplied by Genencor), Glucoamylase GA150 (supplied by Sunson Industry Group), and Transglucosidase L (supplied by Bio-Cat Inc.). The various corn syrups were adjusted to approximately 70% ds. Approximately 3.3% (ν/ν) Spirizyme Plus FG Enzyme was added to each in 50 ml tubes. The syrups were heated in 60°C water baths for approximately 4 days. The enzyme was deactivated by heating the syrups to approximately 85°C for 10 min. Figure 4 shows the final saccharide distributions. All the syrups reached a comparable sugar distribution by the end of the four day treatment. After reversion, very little linear oligomers remained, and non-linear oligomer content had increased. Several points should be noted. First, the reverted Staleydex® 3370 syrup has a somewhat higher dextrose content and lower content of non-linear oligomers than the other syrups. While all syrups were adjusted to approximately 70% ds before reversion, the less converted syrups, with low initial dextrose content, consumed water as the new distribution was established, and final concentrations were 4-9 percentage points higher than the reverted 3370 syrup. (The hydrolysis of a single DP6 oligomer of dextrose to six dextrose molecules, for example, consumes five water molecules.) As Table 5 shows, the water contents of the reverted syrups trend with the dextrose content, and trend inversely with the higher oligomer content. Table 5 Concentrations After Reversion, % Starting Syrup Water Dextrose NL DP4+ Staydex 3370 28 54 23 Sweetose 4300 25 49 27 Neto 7300 21 48 27 Staley 1300 24 48 27 Staley 300 19 47 27 Staley 200 20 46 28 Lower water content drives the equilibrium toward a higher concentration of reversion products. If the water content had been adjusted so that final water contents had been identical, we believe the sugar distributions would also have been identical. Second, all syrups after reversion had much higher percentages of branched oligomers at each degree of polymerization (DP) than linear oligomers. Compare the relative amount of maltose vs. isomaltose, panose vs. maltotriose, and NL DP4+ vs. linear oligomers of DP4 and greater (of which there is virtually none remaining after reversion). Figure 5 shows the change in maltose and isomaltose concentrations over time when a concentrated dextrose syrup was treated with Spirizyme. It would appear that linear oligomers are the kinetic products while non-linear oligomers are the thermodynamic products. That is, forming the linear dimer, maltose, from dextrose is a rapid and reversible reaction with low activation energy. Forming the non-linear dimer, isomaltose, is a slower reaction, and its reverse reaction has a high activation energy. Figures 6 and 7 show the change in maltose and isomaltose concentrations over time when 70% dextrose syrup is treated with different concentrations of Spirizyme enzyme at 60°C. In the treatment of Staley® 1300 syrup with glucoamylase, the linear oligomers of DP 3 and greater were rapidly consumed and converted to dextrose. The concentration of these linear oligomers reached its equilibrium of about 1% of total sugars (at 70% syrup concentration, 0.13% Spirizyme and 60°C) within the first few hours of treatment. (See Figure 8.) Over a longer period, dextrose concentration slowly decreased, and the concentration of non-linear oligomers slowly increased. The change in concentration of maltose and isomaltose over time mirrors that seen for dextrose reversion (Figure 7). Samples from the above experiments were heated above 85°C for 10-20 minutes to deactivate the enzymes before diluting for ion chromatography analysis. Had the samples been diluted in the presence of active enzyme, they might have been hydrolyzed back to dextrose. Samples of the reverted syrups were diluted to 20% solids. A portion of each was held in the presence of Spirizyme enzyme at 60°C and another portion of each was held in the presence of Spirizyme at 40°C. The syrups were sampled over time, and the enzymes in each sample were deactivated as described above. Figure 9 shows the results. At 60°C, the concentration of nonlinear higher oligomers (DP3 and greater) dropped to half within 3 hours and appeared to plateau at about 11.6% of total sugars by 7 hours. Lower temperature slowed hydrolysis. As Figure 9 shows, dextrose content increased as a result of hydrolysis. The rate of hydrolysis when two different glucoamylases (Spirizyme and Dextrozyme) were used was identical. It appears from these experiments that the non-linear oligomers formed through reversion are not immune to hydrolysis by glucoamylase enzymes (or impurities therein). However, it appears that a portion of them is resistant to hydrolysis. At 20% ds the equilibrium between monomer and oligomer is well on the side of monomer. Yet 11.3 % DP4+ and 11.6% DP3+ remain after 7 hours at optimum temperature for glucoamylase activity. Compare this with the virtually complete conversion of linear oligomers to dextrose in the same time frame while at much higher solids (70% ds) and half the glucoamylase content, illustrated in Figure 8. It would appear that, while glucoamylase enzymes can hydrolyze non-linear oligomers, the hydrolysis is not rapid, and may not go to complete conversion. We propose that the digestive enzymes in the human gut will have similarly reduced activity towards these compounds. Table 6 shows the change in concentration of all sugar species when reverted syrup was diluted to 20% ds at 60°C in the presence of active Spirizyme enzyme hr % of total sugars time Glucose isomaltose Maltose Panose Maltoriose LDP3+ NL DP3+ NL DP4+ 0 46.7 16.8 4.5 2.4 0.3 1.0 30.5 28.1 1 58.6 18.1 2.0 0.6 0.1 0.6 20.1 19.5 2 64.0 17.0 2.3 0.5 0.1 0.5 15.3 14.9 3 68.6 15.3 2.1 0.4 0.1 0.4 12.8 12.4 4.75 69.6 14.7 2.1 0.3 0.1 0.5 12.2 11.9 7 72.3 13.0 1.9 0.3 0.1 0.5 11.6 11.3 Table 6 ("L DP3+" refers to linear oligomers having a degree of polymerization of three or more. "NL DP3" refers to nonlinear oligomers having a degree of polymerization of three or more. "NL DP4+" refers to nonlinear oligomers having a degree of polymerization of four or more.) Regardless of starting sugar distribution or degree of conversion, all corn syrups tested were converted to a comparable sugar distribution by glucoamylase if treated at comparable syrup concentrations. From these experiments, it appears that during the enzymatic reversion of corn syrup, linear oligomers are rapidly hydrolyzed to dextrose. Over longer times and at high syrup concentrations the dextrose is consumed as non-linear oligomers are formed. The production of non-linear oligomers is at least partially reversible, as evidenced by their hydrolysis by glucoamylase at lower syrup solids. Thus, when the reverted syrups are diluted before deactivating the glucoamylase, a portion of, but apparently not all of the oligomers are hydrolyzed back to dextrose monomer. This demonstrates that the formation of non-linear linkages by glucoamylase (or perhaps impurities it contains) is not entirely irreversible "mistakes" by the enzyme. Example 5 - Quality of Glucoamylases Impacts Reversion. The amount of enzyme needed to effect the reversion is high relative to typical enzymatic processes. Approximately 1.5% ν/ν of commonly used glucoamylases (for example, Spirizyme Plus FG and Dextrozyme DX 1.5Χ, supplied by Novozymes) are needed to reach 80% of equilibrium reversion in 24 hrs at 60-75°C. It should be noted that enzyme manufacturers have made great strides in reducing the tendency of the glucoamylase to form reversion products - improvements driven by the consumers of these enzymes - the manufacturers of corn syrup - for which reversion products are a bane. It is our belief that the enzymes from the 1950s would be much more efficient for forming these non-linear oligomer syrups than current glucoamylases. Lending support to the concept that "impurities" still in these commercial glucoamylases may be responsible for the reversion products in the experiments reported here is the fact that, while Novozymes reports the optimum temperature for activity for both Spirizyme and Dextrozyme to be 59-61°C, the rate of generation of reversion products increases when temperature is increased from 60 to 65°C. Figures 10 and 11 show the rate of formation of isomaltose and non-linear oligomers of DP 3 and greater (NL DP3+), as a function of temperature, for Spirizyme and Dextrozyme. The substrate syrup was Staley® 1300, and the amount of enzyme used was 2.7% ν/ν. Example 6 - Acid-catalyzed restructuring of corn syrup to form non-linear oligomers. Staley® 1300 syrup was diluted 1:4 with deionized water to facilitate pH determinations. The amount of acid (HCI or H2S04) to drop syrup pH to the pH target was determined. In one experiment, 10% Krystar® crystalline fructose was added to the syrup prior to acid treatment. Staley® 1300 syrup was heated to approximately 60°C in 50 ml screw-cap centrifuge tubes in a shaking water bath. The pre-determined amount of acid needed to reach target pH was added to the syrup. The syrup tubes were shaken vigorously to uniformly distribute the acid. The tubes were returned to the water bath, and bath temperature adjusted as needed. Treatments were performed at 60, 70, and 80°C, and at pHs of 1.2, 1.8 and 2.3. To monitor the progress of the reactions, portions of the syrup were removed from tubes and neutralized by adding a caustic solution. The caustic solutions were prepared such that a volume of caustic solution was sufficient to neutralize an equal volume of acidified syrup. Approximately 80% of this volume was added all at once, which diluted the syrup sufficiently for pH measurement. Additional caustic solution was added dropwise until pH reached >5.0 (and preferably no greater than 6.5). The syrup solutions were analyzed using ion chromatography. In addition to a RSO Oligosaccharide column from Phenomenex, some samples were also analyzed using a Dionex CarboPac ΡΑ200 column. The first acid condensation reaction on Staley® 1300 syrup was at pH 2.3 with sulfuric acid, at 60°C. The proportion of linear oligomers decreased, and non-linear oligomers increased. Figure 12 compares the changes in sugar distributions in Staley® 1300 syrup caused by acid treatment and glucoamylase treatment (both at 60°C). It can be seen that the processes proceed differently. Spirizyme glucoamylase consumes linear oligomers very rapidly, generating dextrose. With Staley® 1300 syrup, the concentration of linear oligomers of DP3 and greater drops from approximately 42% of total sugars to its equilibrium value of approximately 1% within hours of contact with the enzyme. Over a longer period, a portion of the dextrose is converted to non-linear oligomers. The concentration of non-linear DP3 and higher (DP3+) increases over about 30 hours (under the conditions of this enzyme treatment). In contrast, on contact with acid, linear oligomers are consumed and non-linear oligomers formed at comparable rates. Dextrose concentration increases very slowly over the course of the treatment. In a parallel experiment, 10% dry fructose was added to Staley® 1300 syrup, so that the final syrup solids concentration was approximately 90%. It was treated to the same pH, temperature and time as the Staley® 1300 syrup by itself. While the Staley® 1300 syrup developed color over the course of the treatment, the fructose-containing syrup turned coffee-colored almost immediately. IC analysis of samples pulled from it showed the rate of linear oligomers reduction, and non-linear oligomers generation, comparable to the acid-treated syrup by itself. Fructose content was not significantly altered. A second round of acid treatments was conducted in which Staley® 1300 syrup was adjusted to 1.2 and 1.8 pH with HCI. Each pH treatment was run at temperatures of 70°C and 80°C. All syrups generated significant color over the course of the treatments. The extent of color increased with decreasing pH, increasing temperature and increasing time. At the extreme, darkly-colored insoluble components formed. As Figure 13 illustrates, the product of acid-treated syrup is a very broad distribution of sugar oligomers. It also shows a much higher concentration of oligomers of DP3 than the enzyme reverted syrup. Also, the acid-treated syrup contains sugars which do not appear in the enzyme-treated syrup. This is expected since the acid-catalyzed condensations can occur between any two hydroxyl groups, condensations are typically very specific in how two sugar units are CarboPac ΡΑ200 column was used for ion chromatographic separation Figure 14 shows a chromatographic trace of an acid-treated syrup column.

Some of the syrups prepared by these methods were used in the subsequent examples, where they are referenced by sample number. Example 17 A breakfast cereal comprising an oligosaccharide composition according to the present invention can be prepared as described below. The cereal comprises an extruded portion and a coating placed on the extruded portion. The composition of the extruded portion can be as follows (by weight percent): Corn Meal 54.80 Whole Wheat Flour 25.19 Resistant Corn Syrup Solids (Sample 5) 13.51 Whole Oat Flour 5.00 Vitamin blend 0.50 Salt 1.00 Total 100.0 The extruded portion is prepared using the following steps: Uniformly mix ingredients together in a mixer/blender. Feed the dry blend and water to achieve target extrusion moisture. Use typical extrusion and drying conditions. Cool and package. The coating composition is a 75% solids solution of 50% sugar, 50% resistant corn syrup. It is prepared using the following steps: Place spray gun in convection oven at 250°F to preheat. Weigh out approximately 100 g of cereal and place into tumbler that has been first coated with oil based release agent. Blend the dry ingredients (75% total dry solids) in kettle. Add water and mix. Heat the syrup to approximately 230°F (rapid boil). Weight out the desired amount of syrup needed to give the correct ratio of cereal:coating to achieve the appropriate ratio (approximately 45-50% coating by final weight of the cereal). Pour the syrup into the pre-heated spray gun and attach the air line hose to the spray gun. As the cereal is tumbling, spray the syrup onto the cereal until all of the syrup has been applied. After desired amount of coating is applied, allow coated cereal to tumble in enrobing drum for three minutes to insure an even coating. Pour the coated cereal out onto a baking sheet that has been sprayed with release agent. Dry the cereal in convection oven at 250°F for six minutes or until cereal appears dry. Stir halfway through drying to prevent cereal from sticking to the pan and clumping of the cereal. After drying, allow cereal to cool for five minutes. After cooling, weigh the cereal to determine the percent coating. Package cereal in plastic storage bag.

Example 53 Six samples of resistant corn syrup were prepared as in Sample 5 of Example 16 above. Each sample was a 72% ds syrup, with the balance being water. The samples contained essentially no fat, protein, or ash. The six samples were: RCS GR1 (RCS, 72% ds syrup 70% fiber, 15% sugar) ("sugar" in these samples refers to the total of mono- and disaccharides) RCS GR2 (RCS LS, 72% ds syrup 80% fiber, 5% sugar) RCS GR3 (RCS with 50% fructose, 72% ds syrup) RCS GR4 (RCS with 50% sorbitol, 72% ds syrup) RCS GR5 (RCS LS with 25% fructose, 72% ds syrup) RCS GR6 (RCS LS, with 25% sorbitol, 72% ds syrup) Samples containing 25 g (dsb) of the syrup were prepared as follows. 2.838 kg of filtered water was added to a jug containing a pre-weighed quantity of RCS. The lid was placed on the jug, and it was then mixed thoroughly by shaking and swirling until all syrup was dissolved. 12 οζ. (350g) of this solution contained 25 g of the test carbohydrate on a dry solids basis. The control solution was prepared by mixing 25 g anhydrous glucose with 300 mL of water. The samples were administered to 10 healthy human subjects. The characteristics of the subjects were: 5 male, 5 female; age, 35 ± 10 y; body mass index, 24.0 ± 3.8 kg/m2. Each subject undertook nine tests on separate days which included the six test foods and on three occasions the standard glucose drink containing 25 g of available carbohydrate. Blood glucose was measured fasting and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after eating. Incremental areas under the blood glucose response curves (iAUC) were calculated. Each subject's iAUC after consumption of each test food was expressed as a percentage of the mean iAUC of the three glucose controls taken by the same subject. The incremental areas under the curve and relative glycemic response (RGR) of the products were: iAUC RGR Glucose (25 g) 124.4± 13.5a 100a RCS GR1 38.5 ± 4.6b 32.6 ± 3.8' RCS GR2 25.6 ± 3.7b 23.2 ± 4.6' RCS GR3 30.1 ± 4.4b 26.2 ± 4.2' RCS GR4 17.4 ± 4.1b 15.3 ± 3.6' RCS GR5 27.6 ± 4.0b 25.4 ± 4.3' RCS GR6 20.9 ± 4.0b 18.2 ± 3.5' Values with different superscripts differ significantly (p<0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in palatability ratings between any of the foods. Example 54 Sweetose® 4300 corn syrup (81% ds) was evaporated to less than 6% moisture content by passing it through a hot oil jacketed paddle mixer at a rate of 77 kg/h. The paddle mixer rotor speed was typically set for 300 to 600 rpm and the oil jacket temperature was varied from 150°C to 205°C. In some of the tests phosphoric acid was added at a rate to give from 0.1% to 0.4% phosphoric acid solids on corn syrup solids. In some of the tests hydrochloric acid was added at 25 ppm, in place of or in addition to the phosphoric acid.
