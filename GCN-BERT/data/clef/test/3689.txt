6-(Chloroacetyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.500 g, 2.24 mmol) and N-acetylguanidine (0.678 g, 6.71 mmol) suspended in anhydrous acetonitrile (15 ml) in a sealed tube under argon atmosphere. The sealed tube was microwaved at 100Â° C. for 120 min. The precipitate was filtered out and the filtrate residue was purified by flash chromatography over silica gel using 95:5 dichloromethane/methanol to give 6-(1-acetyl-2-amino-1H-imidazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.044 g, 7%) as a yellow solid.
