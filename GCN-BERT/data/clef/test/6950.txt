AMORPHOUS HIGH PERFORMANCE POLYAMIDE CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application serial number 61/993,094, filed May 14, 2014; and U.S. provisional application serial number 62/034,417, filed August 7, 2014, the disclosures of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The disclosure herein relates to an improved method of producing 2 -methyl- 1,5- pentamethylene diamine ("MPMD") based amorphous, semi-aromatic poly amides in order to improve their mechanical properties. It also relates to improved formulations of these polyamides which have further improved mechanical properties. Also disclosed are semi- aromatic polyamide melt blended polymer and an improved method of producing the blend, comprising a diamine/dicarboxylic acid based polyamide including MPMD and an aromatic diacid, terephthalic acid ("T") or isophthalic acid ("I"), blended with an aliphatic polyamide such as either or both of polyhexamethyleneadipamide (N66 or PA66) or polycaproamide (N6 or PA6). These disclosures further relate to articles or parts made from the nylon blended polymer, the partially crystalline articles having improved mechanical performance. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] It is a well-known aspect of polymer science that higher molecular weight polymers tend to have improved impact strengths than their lower molecular weight counterparts. This can have a significant impact on the end-use application of a polymer. MPMD containing polymers are known to suffer from difficulties in building molecular weight to a significant degree due to cyciisation of MPMD and its subsequent volatilization during the initial evaporation process of the polymerization cycle and end-capping of the polymer by the cyclized species (3- methylpiperidine), as disclosed in U.S patent application publication No. 2012/0165466 Al . Several efforts have been made in attempts to overcome this problem. However, these efforts do not seem sufficient to overcome this problem to a significant degree. [0004] Also, very few MPMD based amorphous polyamides for use as molded articles have been disclosed. Due to the ever-present demand for new materials with differentiated properties, MPMD based copolymers provide a way to meet this demand. [0005] A few references detail a significant number of amorphous polyamides based on hexamethylene diamine ("HMD") which generally have a higher isophthalic acid content and a lesser amount of terephthalic acid. The ability of MPMD to disrupt crystallization of the polymer allows for a wider range of formulations to be produced (varying amounts of terephthalic and isophthalic acid content) while retaining the amorphous nature of the polymer. This will, in turn, affect the polymers thermal and mechanical properties allowing it to be differentiated from what is already available and previously described in the art. Thus, need continues to exist in the amorphous polyamide art for improved MPMD based amorphous polyamide compositions with differentiated properties. [0006] Improved mechanical performance applies in many end-use applications of the polymer and in particular to the injection molding end-use for the polymer. Polymers employed in injection molding such as polyamides, copolyamides and their blended formulation are no exception to this fact of mechanical performance improvement, as is appreciated by the skilled person. [0007] Furthermore, it is known that blending nylons with amoiphous semi-aromatic polyamides (e.g., a semi-aromatic copolyamide of poly-hexamethyleneisophthalamide and poly- hexamethyleneterephthalamide called "6I/6T") can improve their retention of stiffness at temperatures above the glass transition temperature of the polyamide and up to about 100°C. However, due to the amorphous nature of the blend component, once above about 100°C, the stiffness is reduced to a level below that of the unblended nylon at the same temperature. [0008] The mechanical performance of nylon (polyamide 6 and polyamide 66) is known to significantly drop-off above its glass transition temperatures (Tg). Off-setting this drop-off may be remedied by blending nylon with an amorphous partially aromatic polyamide, as described in U.S Patent No. 5,266,655. As a result, the mechanical performance is retained to a higher temperature above Tg. [0009] Similarly, high temperature resistant polyamides of semi-aromatic and semi-crystalline copolyamides, which also contain terephthalic acid, are known from European Patent No. 2,510,056B1 . However, there is still room for improvement in this field.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0026] Embodiments of the invention described and claimed herein are not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments herein disclosed, since these embodiments are intended as illusti'ation of several aspects of the disclosure. Any equivalent embodiments are intended to be within the scope of this disclosure. Indeed, various modifications of the embodiments in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. [0027] The invention has been described broadly and generically herein. Each of the narrower species and subgeneric groupings falling within the generic disclosure also form part of the invention. This includes the generic description of the invention with a proviso or negative limitation removing any subject matter from the genus, regardless of whether or not the excised material is specifically recited herein. In addition, where features or aspects of the invention are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the ait will recognize that the invention is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group. [0028] As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to "a reactor" includes a plurality of reactors, such as in a series of reactors. In this document, the term "or" is used to refer to a nonexclusive or, such that "A or B" includes "A but not B," "B but not A," and "A and B," unless otherwise indicated. [0029] Values expressed in a range format should be interpreted in a flexible manner to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. For example, a range of "about 0.1% to about 5%" or "about 0.1 % to 5%" should be interpreted to include not just about 0.1 % to about 5%, but also the individual values (e.g., 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%) and the sub-ranges (e.g., 0.1% to 0.5%, 1.1% to 2.2%, 3.3% to 4.4%) within the indicated range. The statement "about X to Y" has the same meaning as "about X to about Y," unless indicated otherwise. Likewise, the statement "about X, Y, or about Z" has the same meaning as "about X, about Y, or about Z," unless indicated otherwise. [0030] In the methods described herein, the steps can be carried out in any order without departing from the principles of the invention, except when a temporal or operational sequence is explicitly recited. Furthermore, specified steps can be carried out concurrently unless explicit claim language recites that they be carried out separately. For example, a claimed step of doing X and a claimed step of doing Y can be conducted simultaneously within a single operation, and the resulting process will fall within the literal scope of the claimed process. [0031] The term "about" as used herein can allow for a degree of variability in a value or range, for example, within 10%, within 5%, or within 1% of a stated value or of a stated limit of a range. [0032] The term "solvent" as used herein means a liquid medium that is generally regarded by one ordinarily skilled in the art as having the potential to be capable of solubilizing simple organic and/or inorganic substances. [0033] The term "polyamide blend with MPMD-T/MPMD-I" as used herein refers to a polyamide blend comprising a MPMD-T/MPMD-I blend of the present disclosure. The MPMD- T/MPMD-I blend may also be referred to as DT/DI blend in the context of this disclosure. [0034] All publications, including non-patent literature (e.g., scientific journal articles), patent application publications, and patents mentioned in this specification are incorporated by reference as if each were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. [0035] It is understood that the descriptions herein are intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. In the appended claims, the terms "including" and "in which" are used as the plain- English equivalents of the respective terms "comprising" and "wherein," respectively. Moreover, the terms "first," "second," "third," and the like are used merely as labels, and are not intended to impose numerical requirements on their objects. [0036] One aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a composition comprising a copolyamide containing about 40 to about 80 mol % MPMD-T units and about 20 to about 60 mol % MPMD-I units, wherein the copolyamide has a RV of at least 1.90. The term "RV" is the relative viscosity determined according to the ISO 307 (RV) method. [0037] As shown in Table 1, in some embodiments, the copolyamide has a RV of at least 1.95 or 2.00. In Table 1, AEG is the Amine End Groups and Tg is the Glass Transition temperature for the tested copolyamide. AEG and Tg are determined according to the available industrial methods in polymer science. Table 1; Analysis of Various MPMD-T/MPMD-I Formulations [0038] In some embodiments, the copolyamide contains about 50 to about 80 mol % MPMD- T units and about 20 to about 50 mol % MPMD-I units. In a further embodiment, the copolyamide contains about 50 to about 70 mol % MPMD-T units and about 30 to about 50 mol % MPMD-I units. In other embodiments, the copolyamide contains about 60 to about 80 mol % MPMD-T units and about 20 to about 40 mol % MPMD-I units. In some other embodiments, the copolyamide contains about 60 to about 70 mol % MPMD-T units and about 30 to about 40 mol % MPMD-I units. [0039] As shown in Table 2, gradual increases of the isophthalic acid content have unexpected favorable effects on the mechanical properties of the polymer. The amorphous MPMD based polyamides detailed herein have improvements in both tensile strength and Izod impact strength. Table 2: Mechanical Testing All data dry as-molded (DAM) [0040] In Table 2, an amorphous MPMD based polyamide with a terephthalic acid to isophthalic acid ratio of 80:20 (molar) and RV of 1.94 displayed tensile strength of 49 Mega Pascals (MPa) and notched Izod impact strength of 8.25 kiloJoules/sq.m (kJ/m2) and 29 kJ/m2 (unnotched). An amorphous MPMD based polyamide with a terephthalic acid to isophthalic acid ratio of 70:30 (molar) and RV of 1.90 displayed tensile stiength of 82 MPa and Izod impact strength of 9.06 kJ/m2 (notched) and 42 kJ/m2 (unnotched). An amorphous MPMD based polyamide with a terephthalic acid to isophthalic acid ratio of 60:40 (molar) and RV of 2.04 displayed tensile strength of 102 MPa and Izod impact strength of 10.70 kJ/m2 (notched) and 142 kJ/m (unnotched). [0041] In some embodiments, the copolyamide has a RV more than 1.95. In a further embodiment, the copolyamide has a RV more than 2.00. [0042] In some embodiments, the tensile strength of the copolyamide is more than 80 MPa. In a further embodiment, the tensile strength of the copolyamide is more than 100 MPa. [0043] In one embodiment, the notched Izod impact strength of the copolyamide is more than 5 kJ/m2. In another embodiment, the notched Izod impact strength of the copolyamide is more than 7 kJ/m2. [0044] In some embodiments, the unnotched Izod impact strength of the copolyamide is more than 30 kJ/m2. In other embodiments, the unnotched Izod impact strength of the copolyamide is more than 60 kJ/m . [0045] In some embodiments, the molded articles prepared from the copolyamides, according to the disclosed process, may be conditioned according to the ISO 1110 method, [0046] As shown in Table 3, the copolyamide of the disclosed process exhibits improved tensile modulus and tensile strength after conditioning according to the ISO 1110 method. The conditioned copolyamide also exhibit improved flexural modulus and flexural strength than the unconditioned copolyamide. [0047] In some embodiments, the copolyamide has a tensile modulus of more than 3.0 Giga Pascals (GPa). In a further embodiment, the copolyamide has a tensile modulus of more than 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4 GPa. [0048] In some embodiments, the copolyamide has a flexural modulus of more than 3.00 GPa. In a further embodiment, the copolyamide has a flexural modulus of more than 3.10, 3.20, 3.30, or 3.40 GPa. [0049] In some embodiments, the copolyamide has a flexural strength of more than 130 MPa. In a further embodiment, the copolyamide has a flexural strength of more than 135 or 140 MPa. [0050] Another aspect of the disclosed process is directed to a molding article produced from the copolyamide of the disclosed process. [0051] Conventionally, transparent resins are used as materials for molded products required to have usual transparency, such as automotive parts, lightning equipment, and electrical parts. In recent years, particularly, the range of applications of the resins as optical materials required to have excellent optical properties has been extended. In particular, an amorphous polyamide resin derived from a structure with polymerized monomers has low birefringence and high transparency, and hence the resin is used as a transparent resin for optical materials, and the like. [0052] However, the amorphous polyamide resin has low stiffness. Therefore, attempts to improve the stiffness of the amoiphous polyamide resin molded product have been made by addition of a fiber reinforcing material such as a glass fiber, an inorganic filler, a rubber component, or the like. One disadvantage is that such reinforcements may be detrimental to the optical properties of such resins. [0053] Because the copolyamide of the disclosed process exhibits improved stiffness (e.g., see Table 3), it can be applied as optical materials besides automotive parts, lightning equipment, and electrical parts. [0054] In some embodiments, the copolyamide of the disclosed process can be applied to water resource management/filter technology, e.g., filter cups for pneumatic systems or water treatment, fuel filter cups, pump casings, metering devices, and inspection glasses. It can also be applied to machine and apparatus construction, e.g., flow meters, liquid-level indicators, valve blocks and common control blocks for dispensing and metering equipment, and guide rails. Furthermore, it can be used in electrical/electronic applications, e.g., keys and buttons, and casings for switches relays and counters. [0055] The "Trogamid T5000" is a semi-aromatic / aliphatic polyamide, a product of Evonik Industries. [0056] As shown in Table 4, the copolyamide of the disclosed process exhibits improved solvent/chemical resistance. [0057] In some embodiments, the copolyamide of the disclosed process can be applied to applications where resistance to low molecular weight alcohols is required, for example fuel filter cups, or filter bowls, where ethanol is present in the gasoline or liquid level indicators when alcohols are present in the liquid. [0058] In some embodiments, the copolyamides of the disclosed process may be preserved in the presence of a solvent. In other embodiments, the copolyamides of the disclosed process may be chemically resistant to a solvent. In one embodiment, the solvent may be a polar solvent. In another embodiment, the solvent may be from a class of common industrial solvents, such as but not limited to, alcohols, ethers, esters, alkanes, nitriles. Examples of common industrial solvents may include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, propanol, butanol, acetone, acetonitrile, cyclohexane, tetrahydrofuran. In one embodiment, the solvent may be a Cr-Cio alcohol. In another embodiment, the solvent may be methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, pentanol or hexanol. [0059] In some embodiments, the copolyamides of the disclosed process may be preserved in the presence of a solvent for at least about 5 hours. In other embodiments, the copolyamides of the disclosed process may be preserved in the presence of a solvent for at least about 10 hours. In another embodiment, the copolyamides of the disclosed process may be preserved in the presence of a solvent for at least about 16 hours. In yet another embodiment, the copolyamides of the disclosed process may be preserved in the presence of a solvent for at least about 20 hours. In a further embodiment, the copolyamides of the disclosed process may be preserved in the presence of a solvent for at least about 40 hours. [0060] The copolyamides of the disclosed process can be applied to applications, such as, filter technology (filter bowls), electrical and/or electronic components (battery seals, terminal strips, push buttons, casings for relays and switches, connectors, sensors, fuses, etc.), industrial systems such as greasing systems, grease guns, grease hubs, lubricant reservoirs, flowmeters, metering equipment, sight and inspection glasses, guide rails, etc., in optics such as spectacle frames and lenses, safety glasses, sports goggles, medical masks, etc., plumbing components such as brackets, faucets, taps, shower heads, valve housings, pressure reduction valves, etc., furniture and home decor assembly/components such as gears, wheels, clips, etc., and a wide variety of other applications where good chemical and stress resistance are important in addition to excellent processability, mold shrinkage, dimensional stability, molding characteristics, and colorability. [0061] In some embodiments, the copolyamide of the disclosed process may serve as an alternative material to traditional clear thermoplastics such as polycarbonate. In other embodiments, the copolyamide of the disclosed process may serve as an attractive and low-cost material as replacement to transparent polyiaurolactamide (nylon 12 or PA 12) based systems. In some other embodiments, the copolyamide of the disclosed process may serve as an attractive alternative to transparent nylons, for example nylon 6I/6T, where improved thermal properties (Tg and HDT), lower moisture absorption, and higher stiffness are desirable. [0062] Another aspect of the disclosed process is directed to a method of making a copolyamide comprising MPMD with a mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid in the presence of a catalyst.

In other embodiments, the catalyst may be amine salts (e.g., HMD or MPMD) of phenylphosphinic acids and phenylphosphonic acids (e.g., HMD tolylphosphinate). In one embodiment, the catalyst is organophosphites such as triphenylphosphite or Irganox 168. In another embodiment, the catalyst is sodium hypophosphite. [0065] In one embodiment, the catalyst is no more than 1000 ppm of the mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid (based on weight of phosphorus).

In a further embodiment, MPMD is at least 7 mol % excess than the mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. [0067] In some embodiments, the method further comprising mixing MPMD with isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid in water to form an aqueous salt solution and further comprising: (a) Stage 1 : heating the salt solution at a constant temperature (Ti) of at least 130°C to evaporate the salt solution to a concentration of about 70%; (b) Stage 2: heating the about 70% salt solution to a higher temperature (T2) of at least 200°C and pressure (P2) of at least 200 psia under a closed system; (c) Stage 3: gradually distilling water from the solution while the pressure (P2) is held constant and the temperature is increased to T3 of at least 230°C; (d) Stage 4: gradually reducing pressure to atmospheric while the temperature is increased to T4 of at least 260°C; and (e) Stage 5: reducing the pressure by vacuum for at least 15 minutes while the temperature is increased to T5 of at least 280°C. [0068] In one embodiment, stage 1 is conducted at a pressure (Pj) higher than atmospheric. In other embodiments, P4 is at least 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, or 160 psia. [0069] In some embodiments, T1 is at least 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or 200°C. In another embodiment, Ti is from about 130 to about 200°C. In a further embodiment, Tj is from about 180 to about 200°C. [0070] In one embodiment, T2 is at least 205, 210, 215, 220, 225, 230, or 235°C.

The maximum temperature in all cases is limited by the thermal decomposition temperature to up to 500°C. [0077] Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a method of making a conditioned article comprising: i) providing a copoly amide containing about 40 to about 80 mol % 2- · methyl- 1, 5 -pentamethyleneterephthalamide ("MPMD-T") units and about 20 to about 60 mol % 2-methyl-l,5-pentamethyleneisophthalamide C'MPMD-I") units; ii) producing an article from the copolyamide of i); iii) conditioning the article of ii); and iv) recovering the conditioned article from iii). [0078] In some embodiments, the conditioning is conducted according to the ISO 1110 method. General Procedure [0079] The salts used in this process are produced by the gradual addition of MPMD to a mixture of terephthalic and isophthalic acid (of the appropriate ratio) in distilled water (to produce a concentration of 40-50% w/w) at temperatures between 20-60°C until the pH of the resulting solution is 7.6-7.7. At this point, the excess MPMD is added. . The catalyst is added to the salt solution once it is in the autoclave. The catalyst can be an organic or inorganic phosphorus-based acid (in particular, sodium hypophosphite). [0080] In the operation of Stage 1, it is preferred to conduct the distillation at a constant pressure of between 100-150 psia and constant temperature of between 130-200°C. [0081] In the operation of Stage 3, it is preferred to have a constant pressure of between 240- 280 psia. [0082] In the operation of Stage 4, it is preferred to reduce the pressure in a single reduction (i.e., not with staged plateaus) process. [0083] In the operation of Stage 5, the polycondensation continues in the melt and is promoted by the use of vacuum to remove residual water from the salt and water of reaction which aids in the building of molecular weight. [0084] Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a polyamide blend comprising an aliphatic polyamide and a semi-aromatic polyamide. [0085] Examples of suitable aliphatic polyamides include, but are not limited to, polyhexamethlyeneadipamide (N66), polycaproamide (N6), polyenanthamide (nylon 7), polylaurolactamide (nylon 12), polyundecaneamide (nylon 11), polyhexamethylenedodecamide (nylon 612), and any combination thereof. Examples of preferred aliphatic polyamides include nylon 66 (polyhexamethylenediamine) and nylon 6 (polycaproamide). [0086] In some embodiments, the semi-aromatic polyamide is MPMD-T/MPMD-I, as described previously, [0087] In some embodiments, the semi-aromatic polyamide contains about 50 to about 80 mol % MPMD-T units and about 20 to about 50 mol % MPMD-I units. In a further embodiment, the semi-aromatic polyamide contains about 50 to about 70 mol % MPMD-T units and about 30 to about 50 mol % MPMD-I units. In other embodiments, the semi-aromatic polyamide contains about 60 to about 80 mol % MPMD-T units and about 20 to about 40 mol % MPMD-I units. In some other embodiments, the semi-aromatic polyamide contains about 60 to about 70 mol % MPMD-T units and about 30 to about 40 mol % MPMD-I units. [0088] In some embodiments, the semi-aromatic polyamide units are included in the polyamide blend in an amount in the range from 5 to about 40 wt%, relative to the total composition. Preferably the semi-aromatic polyamide units are included in an amount in the range from about 10 to about 35 wt%, preferably, in the range from about 15 to about 30 wt%, relative to the total composition. [0089] In other embodiments, the content of the semi-aromatic polyamide units in the polyamide blend is carefully controlled so that the resulting blend is semi-crystalline, In one embodiment, it may be possible to improve retention of the mechanical properties, in particular stiffness, of the resulting polyamide blends with MPMD-T/MPMD-I in subsequent processing which involve an increase in temperature.
