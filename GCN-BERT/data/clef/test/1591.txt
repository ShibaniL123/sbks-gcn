Botanical classification: Agapanthus hybrid. Varietal denomination: ‘Golden Drop’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Agapanthus of hybrid origin and will be referred to hereafter by its cultivar name, ‘Golden Drop’. ‘Golden Drop’ represents a new perennial herb grown for landscape use. The Inventor discovered the new cultivar in September of 2004 as a naturally occurring chimeral mutation of Agapanthus ‘Streamline’ (not patented) that was growing in a container at his nursery in Auckland, New Zealand. Asexual propagation of the new cultivar was first accomplished by division by the Inventor in December of 2005 in Auckland, New Zealand. Asexual propagation by division has determined that the characteristics of this cultivar are stable and are reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The following traits have been repeatedly observed and represent the characteristics of the new cultivar. The characteristics in combination distinguish ‘Golden Drop’ as a distinct cultivar of Agapanthus. 1. ‘Golden Drop’ exhibits variegated foliage with light green centers and creamy yellow margins.2. ‘Golden Drop’ exhibits flowers that are light blue in color and held on erect stems. The parent plant of ‘Golden Drop’, ‘Streamline’, differs from ‘Golden Drop’ in having green non variegated foliage. ‘Golden Drop’ can be most closely compared to the cultivars ‘Tinkerbell’ (not patented) and ‘Gold Strike’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 20,650). Both are similar to ‘Golden Drop’ in having variegated foliage. ‘Tinkerbell’ differs from ‘Golden Drop’ in having foliage with green centers and white margins and in having flowers that are darker blue in color (medium blue). ‘Gold Strike’ differs from ‘Golden Drop’ in having foliage with darker green centers and golden yellow margins. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying colored photographs illustrate the overall appearance and distinct characteristics of the new Agapanthus. The photographs were taken a one year-old plant of ‘Golden Drop’ as grown outdoors in a 9-cm container in Boskoop, the Netherlands. The photograph in FIG. 1 provides a view of a plant of ‘Golden Drop’ in bloom. The photograph in FIG. 2 provides a close-up view of an inflorescence of ‘Golden Drop’. The photograph in FIG. 3 provides a close-up view of the foliage of ‘Golden Drop’. The colors in the photographs are as close as possible with the photographic and printing technology utilized and color values cited in the detailed botanical description accurately describe the colors of the new Agapanthus. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The general observations and descriptions describe one year-old plants of ‘Golden Drop’ as grown outdoors in 9-cm containers in Boskoop, the Netherlands. The phenotype of the new cultivar may vary with variations in environmental, climatic, and cultural conditions, as it has not been tested under all possible environmental conditions. The color determinations are in accordance with The 2007 R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society, London, England, except where general color terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
