Comparative Example 17: Synthesis of (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine.monomesylate
Isopropanol solution (36.25 g) containing (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine (4.19 g: 33.2 mmol) was charged into a 100 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and mesylic acid (3.19 g: 33.2 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine.monomesylate (7.06 g: 31.7 mmol, yield=96%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 181° C.
