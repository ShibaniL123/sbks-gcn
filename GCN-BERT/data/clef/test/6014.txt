Examples of the above-mentioned catalyst include an acid (for example, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, etc.), a base (for example, ammonia, triethylamine, diethylamine, etc.), a transition metal (for example, Ti, Ni, Sn, etc.), and the like. The catalyst facilitates hydrolysis and dehydration-condensation of the PFPE containing silane compound of the present invention to facilitate a formation of the surface-treating layer. Examples of the other components other than the above-mentioned components include, for example, tetraethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, methyltriacetoxysilane, and the like. The surface-treating agent of the present invention is impregnated into a porous material, for example, a porous ceramic material, a metal fiber for example that obtained by solidifying a steel wool to obtain a pellet. The pellet can be used, for example, in vacuum deposition. Next, the article of the present invention will be described. The article of the present invention comprises a base material and a layer (surface-treating layer) which is formed from the PFPE containing silane compound or the surface-treating agent of the present invention (hereinafter, referred to simply as "surface-treating agent" as a representative thereof) on the surface of the base material. This article can be produced, for example, as follows. Firstly, the base material is provided. The base material usable in the present invention may be composed of any suitable material such as a glass, a resin (may be a natural or synthetic resin such as a common plastic material, and may be in form of a plate, a film, or others), a metal (may be a simple substance of a metal such as aluminum, copper, or iron, or a complex such as alloy or the like), a ceramic, a semiconductor (silicon, germanium, or the like), a fiber (a fabric, a non-woven fabric, or the like), a fur, a leather, a wood, a pottery, a stone, an architectural member or the like. For example, when an article to be produced is an optical member, a material constituting the surface of the base material may be a material for an optical member, for example, a glass or a transparent plastic. For example, when an article to be produced is an optical member, any layer (or film) such as a hard coating layer or an antireflection layer may be formed on the surface (outermost layer) of the base material. As the antireflection layer, either a single antireflection layer or a multi antireflection layer may be used. Examples of an inorganic material usable in the antireflection layer include SiO2, SiO, ZrO2, TiO2, TiO, Ti2O3, Ti2O5, Al2O3, Ta2O5, CeO2, MgO, Y2O3, SnO2, MgF2, WO3, and the like. These inorganic materials may be used alone or in combination with two or more (for example, as a mixture). When multi antireflection layer is formed, preferably, SiO2 and/or SiO are used in the outermost layer. When an article to be produced is an optical glass part for a touch panel, it may have a transparent electrode, for example, a thin layer comprising indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide, or the like on a part of the surface of the base material (glass). Furthermore, the base material may have an insulating layer, an adhesive layer, a protecting layer, a decorated frame layer (I-CON), an atomizing layer, a hard coating layer, a polarizing film, a phase difference film, a liquid crystal display module, and the like, depending on its specific specification. The shape of the base material is not specifically limited. The region of the surface of the base material on which the surface-treating layer should be formed may be at least a part of the surface of the base material, and may be appropriately determined depending on use, the specific specification, and the like of the article to be produced. The base material may be that of which at least the surface consists of a material originally having a hydroxyl group. Examples of such material include a glass, in addition, a metal on which a natural oxidized film or a thermal oxidized film is formed (in particular, a base metal), a ceramic, a semiconductor, and the like. Alternatively, as in a resin, when the hydroxyl groups are present but not sufficient, or when the hydroxyl group is originally absent, the hydroxyl group can be introduced on the surface of the base material, or the number of the hydroxyl group can be increased by subjecting the base material to any pretreatment. Examples of the pretreatment include a plasma treatment (for example, corona discharge) or an ion beam irradiation. The plasma treatment may be suitably used to introduce the hydroxyl group into or increase it on the surface of the base material, further, to clarify the surface of the base material (remove foreign materials, and the like). Alternatively, other examples of the pretreatment include a method wherein a monolayer of a surface adsorbent having a carbon-carbon unsaturated bond group is formed on the surface of the base material by using a LB method (Langmuir-Blodgett method) or a chemical adsorption method beforehand, and then, cleaving the unsaturated bond under an atmosphere of oxygen and nitrogen. Alternatively, the base material may be that of which at least the surface consists of a material comprising other reactive group such as a silicon compound having one or more Si-H groups or alkoxysilane. Next, the film of the above surface-treating agent of the present invention is formed on the surface of the base material, and the film is post-treated, as necessary, and thereby the surface-treating layer is formed from the surface-treating agent. The formation of the film of the surface-treating agent of the present invention can be performed by applying the above surface-treating agent on the surface of the base material such that the surface-treating agent coats the surface. The method of coating is not specifically limited. For example, a wet coating method or a dry coating method can be used. Examples of the wet coating method include dip coating, spin coating, flow coating, spray coating, roll coating, gravure coating, and a similar method. Examples of the dry coating method include deposition (usually, vacuum deposition), sputtering, CVD and a similar method. The specific examples of the deposition method (usually, vacuum deposition) include resistance heating, electron beam, high-frequency heating using microwave, etc., ion beam, and a similar method. The specific examples of the CVD method include plasma-CVD, optical CVD, thermal CVD and a similar method. The deposition method is will be described below in more detail. Additionally, coating can be performed by an atmospheric pressure plasma method. When the wet coating method is used, the surface-treating agent of the present invention is diluted with a solvent, and then it is applied to the surface of the base material. In view of stability of the surface-treating agent of the present invention and volatile property of the solvent, the following solvents are preferably used: an aliphatic perfluorohydrocarbon having 5-12 carbon atoms (for example, perfluorohexane, perfluoromethylcyclohexane and perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane); an aromatic polyfluorohydrocarbon (for example, bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene); an aliphatic polyfluorohydrocarbon (for example, C6F13CH2CH3 (for example, ASAHIKLIN (registered trademark) AC-6000 manufactured by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.), 1,1,2,2,3,3,4-heptafluorocyclopentane (for example, ZEORORA (registered trademark) H manufactured by Nippon Zeon Co., Ltd.); a hydrofluoroether (HFE) (for example, an alkyl perfluoroalkyl ether such as perfluoropropyl methyl ether (C3F7OCH3) (for example, Novec (trademark) 7000 manufactured by Sumitomo 3M Ltd.), perfluorobutyl methyl ether (C4F9OCH3) (for example, Novec (trademark) 7100 manufactured by Sumitomo 3M Ltd.), perfluorobutyl ethyl ether (C4F9OC2H5) (for example, Novec (trademark) 7200 manufactured by Sumitomo 3M Ltd.), and perfluorohexyl methyl ether (C2F5CF(OCH3)C3F7) (for example, Novec (trademark) 7300 manufactured by Sumitomo 3M Ltd.) (the perfluoroalkyl group and the alkyl group may be liner or branched)), or CF3CH2OCF2CHF2 (for example, ASAHIKLIN (registered trademark) AE-3000 manufactured by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.) and the like. These solvents may be used alone or as a mixture of 2 or more compound. Among them, the hydrofluoroether is preferable, perfluorobutyl methyl ether (C4F9OCH3) and/or perfluorobutyl ethyl ether (C4F9OC2H5) are particularly preferable. When the dry coating method is used, the surface-treating agent of the present invention may be directly subjected to the dry coating method, or may be diluted with a solvent, and then subjected to the dry coating method. The formation of the film is preferably performed so that the surface-treating agent of the present invention is present together with a catalyst for hydrolysis and dehydration-condensation in the coating. Simply, when the wet coating method is used, after the surface-treating agent of the present invention is diluted with a solvent, and just prior to applying it to the surface of the base material, the catalyst may be added to the diluted solution of the surface-treating agent of the present invention. When the dry coating method is used, the surface-treating agent of the present invention to which a catalyst has been added is used itself in deposition (usually, vacuum deposition), or pellets may be used in the deposition (usually, the vacuum deposition), wherein the pellets is obtained by impregnating a porous metal such as iron or copper with the surface-treating agent of the present invention to which the catalyst has been added. As the catalyst, any suitable acid or base can be used. As the acid catalyst, for example, acetic acid, formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, or the like can be used. As the base catalyst, for example, ammonia, an organic amine, or the like can be used. Next, the film is post-treated as necessary. This post-treatment is, but not limited to, a treatment in which water supplying and dry heating are sequentially performed, in more particular, may be performed as follows. After the film of the surface-treating agent of the present invention is formed on the surface of the base material as mentioned above, water is supplied to this film (hereinafter, referred to as precursor coating). The method of supplying water may be, for example, a method using dew condensation due to the temperature difference between the precursor coating (and the base material) and ambient atmosphere or spraying of water vapor (steam), but not specifically limited thereto. It is considered that, when water is supplied to the precursor coating, water acts on a hydrolyzable group bonding to Si present in the perfluoro(poly)ether group containing silane compound in the surface-treating agent of the present invention, thereby enabling rapid hydrolysis of the compound. The supplying of water may be performed under an atmosphere, for example, at a temperature of zero to 500°C, preferably 100°C or more and 300°C or less. By supplying water at such temperature range, hydrolysis can proceed. The pressure at this time is not specifically limited but simply may be ambient pressure. Then, the precursor coating is heated on the surface of the base material under a dry atmosphere over 60°C. The method of dry heating may be to place the precursor coating together with the base material in an atmosphere at a temperature over 60°C, preferably over 100°C, and for example, of 500°C or less, preferably of 300°C or less, and at unsaturated water vapor pressure, but not specifically limited thereto. The pressure at this time is not specifically limited but simply may be ambient pressure. Under such atmosphere, between the PFPE containing silane compound of the present inventions, the groups (being hydroxyl groups when all R1 are hydroxyl groups in the above mentioned compound of any of the formula (1a) and (1b); hereinafter the same shall apply) bonding to Si after hydrolysis are rapidly dehydration-condensed with each other. Furthermore, between the compound and the base material, the group bonding to Si in the compound after hydrolysis and a reactive group present on the surface of the base material are rapidly reacted, and when the reactive group present on the surface of the base material is a hydroxyl group, dehydration-condensation is caused. As the result, the bond between the PFPE containing silane compounds of the present invention is formed, and the bond between the compound and the base material is formed. It is noted that if present, the fluorine-containing oil and/or the silicone oil is held or acquired by an affinity to the perfluoropolyether group containing silane compound. The above supplying of water and dry heating may be sequentially performed by using a superheated water vapor. The superheated water vapor is a gas which is obtained by heating a saturated water vapor to a temperature over the boiling point, wherein the gas, under an ambient pressure, has become to have a unsaturated water vapor pressure by heating to a temperature over 100°C, generally of 500°C or less, for example, of 300°C or less, and over the boiling point. When the base material on which the precursor coating is formed is exposed to a superheated water vapor, firstly, due to the temperature difference between the superheated water vapor and the precursor coating of a relatively low temperature, dew condensation is generated on the surface of the precursor coating, thereby supplying water to the precursor coating. Presently, as the temperature difference between the superheated water vapor and the precursor coating decreases, water on the surface of the precursor coating is evaporated under the dry atmosphere of the superheated water vapor, and an amount of water on the surface of the precursor coating gradually decreases. During the amount of water on the surface of the precursor coating is decreasing, that is, during the precursor coating is under the dry atmosphere, the precursor coating on the surface of the base material contacts with the superheated water vapor, as a result, the precursor coating is heated to the temperature of the superheated water vapor (temperature over 100°C under ambient pressure). Therefore, by using a superheated water vapor, supplying of water and dry heating are enabled to be sequentially carried out simply by exposing the base material on which the precursor coating is formed to a superheated water vapor. As mentioned above, the post-treatment can be performed. It is noted that though the post-treatment may be performed in order to further increase friction durability, it is not essential in the producing of the article of the present invention. For example, after applying the surface-treating agent to the surface of the base material, it may be enough to only stand the base material. As described above, the surface-treating layer derived from the film of the surface-treating agent of the present invention is formed on the surface of the base material to produce the article of the present invention. The surface-treating layer thus formed has high surface slip property and high friction durability. Furthermore, this surface-treating layer may have water-repellency, oil-repellency, antifouling property (for example, preventing from adhering a fouling such as fingerprints), surface slip property (or lubricity, for example, wiping property of a fouling such as fingerprints and excellent tactile feeling in a finger) depending on a composition of the surface-treating agent used, in addition to high friction durability, thus may be suitably used as a functional thin film. Therefore, the present invention further provides an optical material having the hardened material on the outermost layer. Examples of the optical material include preferably a variety of optical materials in addition to the optical material for displays, or the like exemplified in below: for example, displays such as a cathode ray tube (CRT; for example, TV, personal computer monitor), a liquid crystal display, a plasma display, an organic EL display, an inorganic thin-film EL dot matrix display, a rear projection display, a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD), a field emission display (FED; Field Emission Display), or a protective plate of such displays, or that in which these displays and protective plates have been subjected to antireflection treatment on their surface. The article having the surface-treating layer obtained according to the present invention is not specifically limited to, but may be an optical member. Examples of the optical member include the followings: lens of glasses, or the like; a front surface protective plate, an antireflection plate, a polarizing plate, or an anti-glare plate on a display such as PDP and LCD; a touch panel sheet of an instrument such as a mobile phone or a personal digital assistance; a disk surface of an optical disk such as a Blu-ray disk, a DVD disk, a CD-R or MO; an optical fiber, and the like. The article having the surface-treating layer obtained according to the present invention may be also a medical equipment or a medical material. The thickness of the surface-treating layer is not specifically limited. For the optical member, the thickness of the surface-treating layer is within the range of 1-30 nm, preferably 1-15 nm, in view of optical performance, friction durability and antifouling property. Hereinbefore, the article produced by using the surface-treating agent of the present invention is described in detail. It is noted that an application, a method for using or a method for producing the article are not limited to the above exemplification.

The static water contact angle was measured for 1 µL of water by using a contact angle measuring instrument (manufactured by KYOWA INTERFACE SCIENCE Co., Ltd.). Firstly, as an initial evaluation, the static water contact angle of the surface-treating layer of which the surface had not still contacted with anything after formation thereof was measured (the number of rubbing is zero). Then, as an evaluation of the friction durability, a steel wool friction durability evaluation was performed. Specifically, the base material on which the surface-treating layer was formed was horizontally arranged, and then, a steel wool (grade No. 0000, dimensions: 5 mm x 10 mm x 10 mm) was contacted with the exposed surface of the surface-treating layer and a load of 1000 gf was applied thereon. Then, the steel wool was shuttled at a rate of 140 mm/second while applying the load. The static water contact angle (degree) was measured per 1,000 shuttling. The evaluation was stopped when the measured value of the contact angle became to be less than 100 degree.

In contrast, the surface-treating agent using the conventional perfluoropolyether group containing silane compound, when the treating amount was increased to 3 mg (Comparative Examples 6 and 7), provided the effect similar to when the treating amount was 2 mg (Comparative Examples 1 and 3), but provided the greatly less friction durability than the above surface-treating agent of the present invention. Additionally, when the treating amount was decreased to 1.5 mg (Comparative Examples 8 and 9), the friction durability was very low, in particular, the friction durability for Example 9 was little. From these results, it was confirmed that the surface-treating agent of the present invention could showed excellent friction durability even when the treating amount is small in comparison with the conventional surface-treating agent.

Here, for Example 13, the friction durability is 9,000 and less than that for Compound (D) alone. The reason for it is estimated to be that the ratio of Compound (D) to Compound (P) was 1:2, thus the amount of Compound (D) became to be substantially 1/3 and too little. Additionally, the friction durability for Examples 14-16 in which Compound (D) and Compound (P) were combined were not less than 20,000, but if the evaluation is continued, the effect to combine with Compound (P) be estimated to be shown. Experiment 4 Evaluation of Surface Slip Property The coefficient of dynamic friction of the surface-treating layers formed on the surface of the base material in the above Examples 1-16 and Comparative Examples 1-9 was measured. Coefficient of dynamic friction (-) was measured by using a surface texture measurement instrument (FPT-1 manufactured by Labthink Co.) using a paper as a friction probe according to ASTM D1894. Specifically, the base material on which the surface-treating layer was formed was horizontally arranged, and then, a friction paper (2 cm x 2 cm) was contacted to an exposed surface of the surface-treating layer and a load of 200 gf was applied thereon. Then, the friction paper was parallely moved at a speed of 500 mm/second while applying the load and the coefficient of dynamic friction was measured. The results are shown in Table 6.

In particular, when Compound (O) was used (Examples 4, 6 and 8) and when Compound (P) which is a fluorine-containing oil was combined (Examples 9-16), it is confirmed that more excellent slip property was shown. Preparation of a surface-treating agent and Formation of a surface-treating layer (spray treatment) Example 17 Compound (D) obtained in Synthesis Example 4 was dissolved in hydrofluoroether (Novec HFE7200 manufactured by Sumitomo 3M Ltd.)) such that the concentration was 0.1wt% to prepare Surface-treating agent 2. Next, Surface-treating agent 2 above prepared was uniformly spray-coated on a chemical strengthening glass (Gorilla glass manufactured by Corning Incorporated; thickness: 0.7 mm) by using the commercial spray coating equipment equipped with a two-fluid nozzle (head speed: 70 mm/sec). The surface of the chemical strengthening glass was subjected to a plasma treatment using an atmospheric pressure plasma generator (manufactured by Enercon Industries Corporation, Dyne-A-Mite IT) just prior to spray coating. A coating amount of the surface-treating agent was 0.2 ml per one plate of chemical strengthening glass (55 mm x 100 mm).
