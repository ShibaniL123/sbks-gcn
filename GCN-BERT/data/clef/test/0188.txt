Method 8
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-[N-((R)-α-{N-[(S)-1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-4-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)butyl]carbamoyl}benzyl)carbamoylmethoxy]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-[N-((R)-α-carboxybenzyl) carbamoylmethoxy]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Example 25; 53 mg, 0.083 mmol), tert-butyl N5-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-L-ornithinate (35 mg, 0.098 mmol), N-methyl morpholine (0.027 m) were dissolved in DCM (5 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min, where after TBTU (32 mg, 0,10 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5 hours. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by chromatography using DCM:EtOAc, 5:1 as eluent to give the title compound 57 mg (72%). M/z= 944.7 and 942.7 (M-H)-.
