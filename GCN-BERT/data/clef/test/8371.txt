OXPRENOLOL COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING CANCER CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/786,241, filed March 14, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD [0002] The present invention relates to oxprenolol compositions and uses thereof, including uses of the oxprenolol compositions for treating cancer. BACKGROUND [0003] Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. In the United States, cancer accounts for 1 of every 4 deaths. With population growth and aging of the population, the number of new cancer patients is expected to double to 2.6 million people by 2050. [0004] Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third most common cause of cancer-related death. The most common form of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is often diagnosed late in the course of clinical manifestation. As a result, only 10-15% of patients are candidates for curative surgery. For the majority of HCC patients, systemic chemotherapies or supportive therapies are the mainstay treatment options. Nevertheless, most chemotherapeutic agents show limited effectiveness and have not been able to improve patient survival. See ,e.g. Ma ΥΤ. Palmer DH. Impact of restricting access to high-cost medications for hepatocellular carcinoma. [Review'] Expert Review' of Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research. 12(4):465-73, 2012 Aug. [0005] Oxprenolol is a non-selective beta blocker which possesses some intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Because of its beta blocker function, oxprenolol has been used for the treatment of various diseases such as angina pectoris, abnormal heart rhythms, and high blood pressure. Oxprenolol is lipophilic and crosses the blood-brain barrier more easily than other more water soluble beta blockers. As a result, oxprenolol is associated with a higher incidence of CNS-related side effects than other beta blockers, but also has more central CNS modes of action.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0043] The present invention provides use of enantiomerically enriched S-oxoprenolol compositions for achieving beneficial results in individuals having cancer, such as treating cancer, prolonging survival, preventing body weight loss, improving quality of life, and/or treating muscle wasting. Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions of oxprenolol that are enantiomerically enriched S-oxprenolol. [0044] The present invention is based on the surprising finding that S-oxprenolol, but not R-oxprenolol, significantly improved survival in animals having cancer in an experiment in which an animal was inoculated with hepatocellular carcinoma cells in a well-established animal model of hepatoma. We have further surprisingly found that S-oxprenolol. when provided in isolated forms in the same amount as those present in a racemic mixture, had an improved effect on survival than the racemic mixture. Similar differential effects of the compositions were observed on preventing body weight loss, preserving lean body mass, and preserving fat mass in the animals. These differential effects suggest that S-oxprenolol is significantly more effective in treating cancer and prolonging survival when present in an enantomerically enriched composition. Moreover, these differential effects were observed in animals not developing cachexia or before the animals develop cachexia, suggesting that at least some of the effect of S-oxprenolol we observed may be independent and/or in addition to its effect on treating cancer cachexia. [0045] Thus, the present invention in one aspect provides methods of treating cancer, prolonging survival, preventing body weight loss, preventing and/or treating muscle wasting, or improving quality of life in an individual having cancer, comprising administering to the individual an effective amount of a composition comprising oxprenolol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein the composition is enantiomerically enriched for S-oxprenolol. [0046] In another aspect, there are provided pharmaceutical compositions comprising oxprenolol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the composition is enantiomerically enriched for S-oxprenolol. [0047] Also provided are kits, unit dosages, medicines, and articles of manufacture that are useful for methods described herein. Definitions [0048] The following terms have the following meanings unless otherwise indicated. Any undefined terms have their art recognized meanings. [0049] As used herein, “treatment” or “treating” is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including clinical results. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: alleviating one or more symptoms resulting from the disease, delay or slowing the progression of the disease, ameliorating the disease state, delaying the progression of the disease, increasing the quality oflife, and/or prolonging survival. Also encompassed by ‘'treatment” is a reduction of pathological consequence of cancer. The methods of the invention contemplate any one or more of these aspects of treatment. [0050] The term “individual” refers to a mammal and includes, but is not limited to, human, bovine, horse, feline, canine, rodent, or primate. In some embodiments, the individual is a human. [0051] As used herein, an “at risk” individual is an individual who is at risk of developing cancer. An individual “at risk” may or may not have detectable disease, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease prior to the treatment methods described herein. “At risk” denotes that an individual has one or more so-called risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of cancer. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing cancer than an individual without these risk factor(s). [0052] “Adjuvant setting” refers to a clinical setting in which an individual has had a history of cancer, and generally (but not necessarily) been responsive to therapy, which includes, but is not limited to, surgery (e.g., surgery' resection), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, because of their history of cancer, these individuals are considered at risk of development of the disease. Treatment or administration in the “adjuvant setting” refers to a subsequent mode of treatment. The degree of risk (e.g., when an individual in the adjuvant setting is considered as “high risk” or “low' risk”) depends upon several factors, most usually the extent of disease when first treated. [0053] “Neoadjuvant setting” refers to a clinical setting in which the method is carried out before the primary/defmitive therapy. [0054] As used herein, “delaying” the development of a disease means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone development of the disease. This delay can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individual being treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop the disease. A method that “delays” development of a disease is a method that reduces probability of disease development in a given time frame and/or reduces the extent of the disease in a given time frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons are typically based on clinical studies, using a statistically significant number of subjects. [0055] As used herein, by “combination therapy” is meant that a first agent be administered in conjunction with another agent. “In conjunction with” refers to administration of one treatment modality in addition to another treatment modality, such as administration of a nanoparticle composition described herein in addition to administration of the other agent to the same individual. As such, “in conjunction with” refers to administration of one treatment modality before, during, or after delivery of the other treatment modality to the individual. Such combinations are considered to be part of a single treatment regimen or regime. [0056] The term “effective amount” used herein refers to an amount of a compound or composition sufficient to treat a specified disorder, condition or disease such as ameliorate, palliate, lessen, and/or delay one or more of its symptoms. [0057] The term “simultaneous administration,” as used herein, means that a first therapy and second therapy in a combination therapy are administered with a time separation of no more than about 15 minutes, such as no more than about any of 10, 5, or 1 minutes. When the first and second therapies are administered simultaneously, the first and second therapies may be contained in the same composition (e.g., a composition comprising both a first and second therapy) or in separate compositions (e.g., a first therapy in one composition and a second therapy is contained in another composition). [0058] As used herein, the term “sequential administration” means that the first therapy and second therapy in a combination therapy are administered with a time separation of more than about 15 minutes, such as more than about any of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or more minutes. Either the first therapy or the second therapy may be administered first. The first and second therapies are contained in separate compositions, which may be contained in the same or different packages or kits. [0059] As used herein, the term “concurrent administration” means that the administration of the first therapy and that of a second therapy in a combination therapy overlap with each other. [0060] As used herein, by “pharmaceutically acceptable” or “pharmacologically compatible” is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, e.g., the material may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition administered to an individual without causing any significant undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the composition in which it is contained. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients have preferably met the required standards of toxicological and manufacturing testing and/or are included on the Inactive Ingredient Guide prepared by the U.S. Food and Drug administration. [0061] "Progression free survival" (PFS) indicates the length of time during and after treatment that the cancer does not grow. Progression-free survival includes the amount of time individuals have experienced a complete response or a partial response, as well as the amount of time individuals have experienced stable disease. In some embodiments, an individual has a capacity to accept more courses of chemotherapy during progression free survival. [0062] The term “isomers” or “stereoisomers” refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. [0063] The term “chiral” refers to molecules which have the property of ηοηsuperimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term “achiral” refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner. [0064] The term “diastereomers” refers to stereoisomers with two or more centers of dissymmetry and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. [0065] The term “enantiomers” refers to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable minor images of one another. An equimolar mixture of two enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture” or a “racemate.” [0066] The term “enantiomerically enriched” means that to the racemic mixture (i.e., 50/50 mixture of the enantiomers) has been purified such that one enantiomer comprises greater than 50% of the total amount of the compound present. For example, a composition that is enantiomerically enriched for S-oxprenolol is a composition wherein more than 50% of the oxprenolol is the S-enantiomer of oxprenolol (S-oxprenolol). [0067] The degree of enantiomeric enrichment of a composition can be determined by “enantiomeric excess,” or ee, “Enantiomeric excess” represents the percentage of one enantiomer in excess of ihe other. For instance, a composition having a 75:25 mixture of S-oxprenolol and R-oxprenoiol has a 75 - 25 = 50 % ee, while a 50:50 racemic mi xture has a 50 - 50 = 0 % ee. The value of ee will be a number from 0 to 100, 0 being racemic and 100 being pure, single enantiomer. [0068] The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” means a salt which is acceptable for administration to a subject, such as a mammal (salts with counterions having acceptable mammalian safety for a given dosage regime). Such salts can be derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids. “Pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a compound, which salts are derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like; and when the molecule contains a basic functionality, salts of organic or inorganic acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, formate, tartrate, besylate, mesylate, acetate, maleate, oxalate, and the like. [0069] The term “salt thereof’ means a compound formed when a proton of an acid is replaced by a cation, such as a metal cation or an organic cation and the like. Where applicable, the salt is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, although this is not required for salts of intermediate compounds that are not intended for administration to the subject. By way of example, salts of the present compounds include those wherein the compound is protonated by an inorganic or organic acid to form a cation, with the conjugate base of the inorganic or organic acid as the anionic component of the salt. [0070] “Solvate” refers to a complex formed by combination of solvent molecules with molecules or ions of the solute. The solvent can be an organic compound, an inorganic compound, or a mixture of both. Some examples of solvents include, but are not limited to, methanol, ,V,ALdimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, and water. When the solvent is water, the solvate formed is a hydrate. [0071] It will be appreciated that the term “or a salt or solvate thereof” is intended to include all permutations of salts and solvates, such as a solvate of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a subject compound. [0072] As used herein, “in conjunction with” refers to administration of one treatment modality in addition to another treatment modality. As such, “in conjunction with” refers to administration of one treatment modality before, during or after administration of the other treatment modality to the individual. [0073] As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural reference unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, [0074] Reference to “about” a value or parameter herein includes (and describes) embodiments that are directed to that value or parameter per se. For example, description referring to “about X” includes description of “X.” [0075] It is understood that aspects and variations of the invention described herein include “consisting" and/or “consisting essentially of’ aspects and variations.

The present disclosure also provides such compositions which are useful for the methods disclosed herein. [0126] Oxprenolol is l-[2-(allyloxy)phenoxy]-3-(isopiOpylamino)propan-2-ol. The structure of oxprenolol is shown below. [0127] Oxprenolol exists in optically active forms. Optically active compounds have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes “d” and “1” or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is “levorotatory” and with (+) or d meaning that the compound is “dextrorotatory." There is no correlation between nomenclature for the absolute stereochemistry and for the rotation of an enantiomer. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called “stereoisomers,” are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an “enantiomer," and a mixture of such isomers is often called an “enantiomeric" or “racemic" mixture. [0128] Oxprenolol is a chiral compound. As a racemic mixture, there is a mixture of (R)-(+)-oxprenolol and (5)-(-)-oxprenolol. Analytical methods, such as HPLC, can be used for separation and quantification of (/?)-(+)-oxprenolol and (S)-(-)-oxprenolol in mixtures. The structures of (R)-(+)-oxprenolol and (S)-(-)-oxprenolol are shown below. fPY°--^CH2 CH3 Ν'XHa hoh h (Λ)-(+)-οχρΐ·℮ηο1ο1 or R-oxprenolol (7?)-l-(2-(allyloxy)phenoxy)-3- (isopropylamino)propan-2-ol h°h η CH3 (S)-(-)-oxprenolol or S-oxprenolol (5)-1 -(2-(ally1oxy)phenoxy)-3-(isopropylamino)propan-2~ol [0129] The compositions described herein are enantiomerieally enriched for S-oxprenolol. For example, in some embodiments, the composition comprises an enantiomeric excess of at least about 1 %, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% of S-oxprenolol. In some embodiments, the composition comprises an enantiomeric excess of at least about 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% of S-oxprenolol. In some embodiments, the composition comprises an enantiomeric excess of at least about 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, or 100%, up to the detectable limit of purity, of S-oxprenolol. In some embodiments, the composition comprises an enantiomeric excess of any of about 1-4%, 5-9%, 10-11%, 20-29%, 30-39%, 40-49%, 50-59%. 60-69%. 70-79%, 80-89%, 90-99, or 100% of S-oxprenolol. In some embodiments, the composition comprises an enantiomeric excess of at least about 99% or 100% of S-oxprenolol (i.e., pure S-oxprenolol). In some embodiments, the composition comprises an enantiomeric excess of at least 99.1,99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6, 99.7, 99.8, 99.9 or 100% of S-oxprenolol (i.e., pure S-oxprenolol). Methods of making enantiomerically enriched compositions of oxprenolol are known in the art. [0130] Two main routes are established for obtaining enantiomerically enriched compounds: (I) asymmetric syntheses and (2) racemic resolutions. (R. A. Sheldon: The Industrial Synthesis of Optically Active Compounds, in Miklos Simonyi (editor), Problems and Wonders if Chiral Molecules, Akademiai Kiado, Budapest, 1990, S. 349-386). The syntheses give medium-high yields and excellent enantiomeric excess, but the resolutions are limited by 50% yield. Both technologies involve techniques such as dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) and membrane-based extraction (Augustian J et al., Process Biochemistry Volume 45, Issue 10, October 2010, Pages 1587-1604). One method describes enantiomer enrichment of oxprenolol up to 68 % enantiomeric excess was achieved by using a cellulose tris(3,5-dimefhylphenylcarbamate) (CTPC)-coated rayon-belt. (Yashima Ε. et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry Volume 6, Issue 8, August 1995, Pages 1889-1890). [0131] The compositions described herein in some embodiments are present in pharmaceutical compositions.

Study Protocol with Yoshida Hepatoma Model [0171] Ascites hepatoma Yoshida AH-130 cells (108 cells) were inoculated into about 200 gram male Wistar rats by i.p. injection. Alternatively animals received saline injection only (sham). The day after inoculation animals were randomized into various groups and then received twice daily treatment with either placebo or various test compositions by oral gavage over a period of up to 17 days. The primary endpoints of the study included assessment of body weight, body composition (with and without tumor), and survival. Body composition was monitored by NMR. Echocardiography was used in instances to monitor condition of the heart. Organ weight was assessed at the end of the study (or after death) as a secondary endpoint. In addition, locomotor activity and food intake were also assessed. Figure 1 provides a diagram showing the design study. R-and S-oxprenolol were manufactured to order by Peakdale Molecular', Peakdale Science Park, Sheffield Road, Chapel-en-le-Frith, High Peak SK23 0PG, UK Example 4. Effect of S-OxprenoIol or R-Oxprenolol on Survival [0172] To study the effect of S-oxprenolol and R-oxprenolol on survival, survival was monitored over time. Figure 2 shows the percent survival of rats that were administered with S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at dosages of 25 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 2, rats receiving S-oxprenolol had longer survival than those in the placeo group or those receiving R-oxprenolol. Rats receiving R-oxprenolol did not show' statistically significant improvement on survival over those in the placebo group. [0173] Figure 3 shows the percent survival of rats that were administered with S-oxprenolol or a racemic mixture of oxprenolol at dosages of 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day respectively. Because the racemic mixture contains 50% of S-oxprenolol and 50% of R~ oxprenolol, the effective amount of S-oxprenolol in each composition was the same. As shown in Figure 3, rats receiving S-oxprenolol had longer survival than those receiving the racemic mixture, even though the effective amount of S-oxprenolol in each composition was the same. [0174] Figure 4 show’s the percent survival of rats that were administered with S-oxprenolol at dosages of 12.5, 25, 50, 70, or 100 mg/kg/day. One control group received S-pindolol at its preferred dosage of 3 mg/kg/day. Figure 5 further show's the percent survival of rats that were administered with S-oxprenolol at dosages of 5, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day. As shown in both Figures 4 and 5, 50 mg/kg/day S-oxprenolol had the best effect on survival among all dosages tested. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4. S-oxprenolol was significantly superior to either placebo or S-pindolol at its preferred dose. [0175] Figure 6 shows the percent survival of rats that were administered with R-oxprenolol at dosages of 5, 12.5, 25, or 50 tng/kg/day. As shown in Figure 6, no statistically significant survival benefit over placebo w'as observed in rats administered with R-oxprenolol. Example 5. Effect of S-Oxprenolol or R-Oxprenolol on Body Weight [0176] To study the effect of the test compounds on body weight, body weight was monitored over time. The sham body weight w'as 71.6+1.8 g. [0177] Figure 7 show's the change of body weight (in grams) in rats administered with S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at dosage of 5, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 7, rats receiving S-oxprenolol had less body weight loss than those in the placebo group and those administered with R-oxprenolol. [0178] Figure 8 shows the change in body weight (in grams) of rat populations that were administered with S-oxprenolol or a racemic mixture of oxprenolol at dosages of 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day respectively. Because the racemic mixture contains 50% of S-oxprenolol and 50% of R-oxprenolol, the effective amount of S-oxprenolol in each composition was the same. As shown in Figure 8, rats receiving S-oxprenolol had less body weight loss than those receiving the racemic mixture, even though the effective amount of S-oxprenolol in each composition was the same. [0179] Figure 9 shows the change in body weight (in grams) of rats that were administered with S-oxprenolol at dosages of 12.5, 25, 50, 70, or 100 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 9, rats receiving 50 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day of the S-oxprenolol had the least body weight loss. Example 6. Effects of S-Oxprenolol or R-Oxprenolol on Preserving Lean Body Mass [0180] To study the effect of the test compounds on lean body mass, lean mass was determined at the end of the study. The sham lean body mass was 48.6±1.5 grams. [0181] Figure 10 shows the change in lean body mass (in grams) of rats that were administered with S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at dosages of 5. 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 10, rats receiving S-oxprenolol at doses of 12.5 mg/kg/day or higher had less change in lean body mass than those receiving R-oxprenolol. [0182] Figure 11A shows the change in lean body mass (in grams) of rats that were administered with S-oxprenolol or a racemic mixture of oxprenolol at dosages of 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day respectively. Because the racemic mixture contains 50% of S-oxprenolol and 50% of R-oxprenolol, the effective amount of S-oxprenolol in each composition was the same. As shown in Figure 11 A, rats receiving S-oxprenolol had less change in lean body weight than those receiving the racemic mixture, even though the effective amount of S-oxprenolol in each composition was the same. [0183] To take into account the fact that more lean body mass loss is observed in rats that live longer, the results in Figure 11Α was further shown in Figure 1 IB in terms of lean body weight mass/days alive. As shown in Figure 1 IB, even after taking the days alive into account, rats receiving S-oxprenolol had less change in lean body mass than those receiving the racemic mixture. [0184] Figure 12Α shows the change in lean body mass (in grams) of rats administered with S-oxprenolol at dosages of 12.5, 25, 50, 70, or 100 mg/kg/day. One control group received S-pindolol at its preferred dosage of 3 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 12Α, rats receiving 100 mg/kg/day of S-oxprenolol had the least change in lean body mass compared to rats receiving other doses S-oxprenolol. To take into account the fact that more lean body mass loss is observed in rats that live longer, the results in Figure 1.2Α was further shown in Figure 12Β in terms of lean body weight mass/days alive. As shown in Figure 12Β, rats receiving 100 mg/kg/day of S-oxprenolol had the least change in lean body mass/days alive compared to rats receiving other doses S-oxprenolol. Example 7. Effects of S-Oxprenolol and R-Oxprenolol on Skeletal Muscle Atrophy and Heart Weight [0185] To study the effect of the test compounds on skeletal muscle atrophy and heart weight, the skeletal muscle mass and heart weight were determined at the end of the study. [0186] Figures 13A-13D show the mass of various types of skeletal muscle (in grams/100 grams lean muscle) of rat populations that were administered with S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at the dosages of 5, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day. Figure 13Α shows results for gastrocnemius muscle. Figure Τ3Β shows results for tibialis anterior muscle. Figure 13C shows results for soleus muscle. Figure 13D shows results for extensor digitomm longus (EDL) muscle. Figures 13A-13D show that S-oxprenolol reduces wasting of individual hind limb muscles independent of their composition of slow and fast twitch muscle fibers (mixed fiber type: gastrocnemius and tibialis; slow' fiber type: soleus; fast fiber type: EDL). R-oxprenolol does not have this protective effect. A higher muscle mass is associated with better muscle function. Example 8. Effects of S-Oxprenolol and R-Oxprenolol on Preserving Fat Mass [0187] To study the effect of the test compounds on fat mass, the fat mass were determined at the end of the study. [0188] Figure 14 shows the change in fat mass (in grams) of rats administered with S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at dosages of 5, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 14, rats receiving S-oxprenolol at 12.5 mg/kg/day or higher had less fat mass loss than those in the placebo group or those receiving R-oxprenolol. [0189] Figure 15Α shows the weight of white adipose tissue (WAT) (in grams) of rats administered with S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at dosages of 5, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 15A, S-oxprenolol had better effects in reducing fat wasting than R-oxprenolol. [0190] Figure 15Β shows the weight of brown adipose tissue (BAT) (in grams) of rats administered with S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at dosages of 5, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 15Β, both enantiomers of oxprenolol protect BAT mass and thus treated rats retained better control of thermogenesis. [0191] Figure 16Α shows the weight of white adipose tissue (WAT) (in grams) of rats administered with S-oxprenolol or a racemic mixture of oxprenolol at dosages of 20 mg/kg/day or 40 mg/kg/day respectively. Because the racemic mixture contains 50% of S-oxprenolol and 50%- of R-oxprenolol, the effective amount of S-oxprenolol in each composition was the same. As shown in Figure 16Α, rats receiving S-oxprenolol had significantly better effect in preserving the white adipose tissue than those receiving the racemic mixture, even though the even though the effective amount of S-oxprenolol in each composition was the same. [0192] Figure 16Β shows the weight of brown adipose tissue (BAT) (in grains) of rats administered with S-oxprenolol or a racemic mixture of oxprenolol at dosages of 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day respectively. Because the racemic mixture contains 50% of S-oxprenolol and 50% of R-oxprenolol, the effective amount of S-oxprenolol in each composition was the same. As shown in Figure 16Β, rats receiving S-oxprenolol had better effect in preserving the brown adipose tissue than those receiving the racemic mixture, even though the even though the effective amount of S-oxprenolol in each composition was the same. Example 9. Effect of S-Oxprenolol or R-Oxprenolol on Quality of Life [0193] To study the effect of the test compounds on quality of life, parameters of quality of life such as food intake and locomotor activity were assessed at Day 11. [0194] Figure 17 show’s food intake of rats administered with S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at dosages of 5 mg/kg/day or 25 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 17, rats receiving S-oxoprenolol or R-oxprenolol had higher food intake than those in the placebo group. Rats receiving 25 mg/kg/day S-oxprenolol had higher food intake than those receiving the same amount of R-oxprenolol. [0195] Figure 18 shows the locomotor activity of rats administered with the S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at dosages of 5 mg/kg/day or 25 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 18, rats receiving S-oxoprenolol or R-oxprenolol had higher locomotive activity than those in the placebo group. Rats receiving 25 mg/kg/day S-oxprenolol had higher locomotive activity than those receiving the same amount of R-oxprenolol. Example 10. Effect of S-Oxprenolol or R-Oxprenolol on Tumor Growth [0196] To study the effect of the test compounds on tumor growth, tumor growth was assessed at tire end of the study. [0197] Figure 19Α shows the tumor volume (in ml) of rats administered with S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at dosages of 5, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day. Figure 19Β shows the total number of cells in a tumor of rats administered with S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol at dosages of 5, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day. As show'n in Figures 19Α and 19Β, rats receiving S-oxprenolol or R-oxprenolol did not have any significant effects on tumor growth compared to those in the placebo group. [0198] The effect of the test compounds on tumor growth was also evaluated in an in vitro experiment with various tumor cells, namely, Kelly (neuroblastoma), I-Iela-93 (cervix carcinoma), and B16V (melanoma). Cell growth was assessed by BrdU incorporation (left of Figure 20) and ΧΤΤ assay (right of Figure 20). Doxorubicin was used as a positive control. As shown in Figure 20, neither S-oxprenolol nor R-oxprenolol showed any inhibitor effects on tumor cell proliferation. Example 11. Effects of racemic mixture of S-oxprenolol and R-oxprenolol [0199] The test compounds as mixtures of enantiomers in certain percentages were tested on a population of rats. [0200] To study the effect of the test compounds as mixtures of enantiomers on body weight, body weight was monitored over time. Figure 21 shows the change in body w'eight (in grams) of rat populations that w'ere administered wdth 15% S-oxprenolol/25% R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 mg/kg/day; 90% S-oxprenolol/10% R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 mg/kg/day; or placebo. As shown in Figure 21, rats receiving 75% S-oxprenolol/25% R-oxprenolol or 90% S-oxprenolol/10% R-oxprenolol had less body weight loss than those recei ving the placebo. [0201] To study the effect of the test compounds as mixtures of enantiomers on lean body mass, lean mass w'as determined at the end of the study. Figure 22Α shows the change in lean body mass (in grams) of rats that were administered with75% S-oxprenolol/25% R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 mg/kg/day; 90% S-oxprenolol/10% R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 mg/kg/day; or placebo. As shown in Figure 22Α, rats receiving75% S-oxprenolol/25% R-oxprenolol or 90% S-oxprenolol/10% R-oxprenolol had less change in lean body mass than those receiving placebo. [0202] To study the effect of the test compounds as mixtures of enantiomers on fat mass, the fat mass were determined at the end of the study. Figure 22Β shows the change in fat mass (in grams) of rats administered with 75% S-oxprenolol/25%) R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 nig/kg/day; 90% S-oxpreno)ol/10% R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 mg/kg/day; or placebo. As shown in Figure 22Β, rats receiving 75% S-oxprenolol/25% R-oxprenolol or 90% S-oxprenolol/10% R-oxprenolol had less fat mass loss than those receiving placebo. [0203] To study the effect of the test compounds as mixtures of enantiomers on heart weight, the heart weight was determined at the end of the study. Figure 23 shows the mass of the heart (in milligrams) of rat populations that were administered with75% S-oxprenolol/25% R-oxprenolol at dosages of40 mg/kg/day; 90%> S-oxprenolol/10% R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 mg/kg/day; or placebo. As shown in Figure 23, rats receiving 75% S-oxprenolol/25% R-oxprenolol or 90%) S-oxprenolol/10% R-oxprenolol had more heart mass than those receiving placebo. A higher muscle mass is associated with better muscle function. [0204] To study the effect of the test compounds as mixtures of enantiomers on fat mass, the fat mass were determined at the end of the study. Figure 24 shows the weight of brown adipose tissue (BAT) (in grams) of rats administered with75% S-oxprenolol/25% R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 mg/kg/day; 90% S-oxprenolol/10% R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 mg/kg/day; or placebo. As shown in Figure 24, rats receiving 75% S-oxprenolol/25% R-oxprenolol or 90% S-oxprenolol/10% R-oxprenolol more brown adipose tissue and retained better control of thermogenesis than those receiving placebo. [0205] To study the effect of the test compounds as mixtures of enantiomers on skeletal muscle atrophy, the skeletal muscle mass was determined at the end of the study. Figure 25 show the mass of tibialis anterior muscle (in milligrams) of rat populations that were administered with 75% S-oxprenolol/25% R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 mg/kg/day; 90% S-oxprenolol/10%' R-oxprenolol at dosages of 40 mg/kg/day; or placebo. A higher muscle mass is associated with better muscle function. 1.
