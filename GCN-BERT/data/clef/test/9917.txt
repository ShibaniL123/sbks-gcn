IMPROVED LIMB PROTECTORS, METHODS OF MAKING AND METHODS OF USING CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED CASES [001] This application is a Continuation-in-Part under 35 U.S.C. § 120 of commonly- owned and co-pending U.S. Application No. 13/208,229, filed on August 11, 2011, and also claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to commonly-owned and co-pending U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/982,317, which was filed on April 21, 2014. The subject matter of each of the foregoing applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD [002] The present disclosure relates to improved limb protectors and, in particular, to limb protectors with improved circumferential coverage and improved impact resistance. BACKGROUND [001] The use of protective limb guards in athletics and extreme sports is well known. For example, shin guards have been used to protect the front surface of a user's lower leg in athletics for some time. Football (American soccer) shin guards are a single piece of hard plastic that is curved to fit over a user's shin bone, and is worn underneath and secured in place over the shin by a long sock. Variations and modifications of the traditional shin guard include attaching a stirrup to the shin guard, to prevent the shin guard from moving up the shin during use. [002] The specifications for the guards that may be used by players is often determined by various associations and/or regulatory bodies. However, professional players may have discretion regarding the selection of protective gear, and may prefer to minimize the size of hard plastic shin guards, because they can be uncomfortable and interfere with their performance. Therefore, many professional players select smaller sized hard plastic guards, to minimize the surface area of the guard, and improve comfort and ease of play. However, doing so leaves the player exposed to more injuries. [003] There is a need for improved limb protection in athletics and other areas. SUMMARY [004] The present disclosure is directed to, in one embodiment, a limb protector that comprises a compression sleeve and one or more conformal, articulating pads disposed on the sleeve. The one or more pads can comprise circumferential coverage of greater than 90 degrees. The pads comprise polyurethane foam with a density ranging from about 8 pounds per cubic foot (pcf) to about 30 pcf and a thickness ranging from about 0.2 inches to about 1 inch. [005] The present disclosure is directed to, in another embodiment, a limb protector, comprising a compression sleeve and one or more conformal, articulating pads disposed on the sleeve, the one or more pads comprising circumferential coverage of greater than 90 degrees. The pads are constructed to prevent the transmission of force of no greater than 50 kiloNewtons (kN). [006] The above described and other features are exemplified by the following figures and detailed description.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0020] The present disclosure is directed to improved impact absorbing and cushioning limb protectors (hereinafter "protectors") to be worn during any activity in which individuals are susceptible to limb injuries, such as in athletics, construction, military, and the like. The construction of the present protectors is rugged, durable, and able to withstand the temperatures, detergents and mechanical action used in industrial and/or commercial laundering, unlike other protectors, which may degrade under such harsh conditions. [0021] The present protectors are lightweight, flexible and articulating, and provide improved impact-resistance and reduced force transmission to a user, in addition to being aesthetically pleasing and durable. As used herein, the term "flexible," means the ability of the pad to move by bending, twisting, flexing and/or stretching, and the like. "Articulating," as used herein, means a structure that comprises one or more joined segments, i.e., not a sheet of uniform thickness without any segments. The segments may be joined by a variety of techniques, provided that the segments are fixed in relation to one another. "Conformal," as used herein, means matches the shape of the limb. "Impact resistant," or "impact resistance," as used herein, means that the surface of the padding is resistant to being torn or perforated. "Transmitted force," as used herein, means the force transmitted to the pad during a spherical impactor test. [0022] For ease of illustration, the limb protection protectors of the present disclosure will be illustrated with reference to a lower leg protector, or shin guard. Although described herein with reference to a lower leg protector, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the protector may be adapted to any limb or body part that requires protection. [0023] In some embodiments, the limb protectors according to the present disclosure can include a tubular compression sock, sleeve or stirrup, constructed to receive and fit closely against a user's limb. For ease of illustration, unless otherwise noted, the sock, sleeve or stirrup protectors will be referred to interchangeably hereinafter as a "sleeve." As shown in the figures, the sleeve has opposing front and back regions and opposing inner and outer side regions. [0024] Shin guards are often subjected to impact tests to assess the energy absorbing and penetration resistance properties of shin guards, such as blunt impact and a stud impact tests. Blunt impact tests assess the impact absorbing properties of the guard. Tests typically involve dropping a striker onto the outer shell of the guard and measuring the amount of force transmitted through the guard. In Europe, two stud impact tests are used to assess the penetration resistance properties and the rigidity of the shin guards against football (soccer) boot studs. Guards are assessed visually to determine if penetration through the inner surface has occurred. In the case of the vertical stud test, the distance that the stud has travelled over the surface of the outer shell is also recorded. [0025] Limb protectors used for more extreme conditions, such as for use by motorcyclists, have more aggressive testing. In Europe, the protective qualities of armor worn on the limb joints while riding a motorcycle are tested using CE EN 1621-1, which involves placing a sample over a rigid metal hemispherical anvil with a 50 mm radius, which is in turn connected to a rigid and massive base via a high speed force sensor. A 5 kg impactor with a flat strike face 80 mm x 40 mm is then dropped onto the sample from a height necessary to generate an impact speed of 4.47 m/s, which equates to an impact energy of 50 joules. During the impact, the force transmitted through the sample to the anvil is measured by the high speed force transducer. The lower the force, the more protective a product is considered to be. To pass the standard the mean maximum transmitted force must be below 35 kN, and no single value should be over 50 kN. The present pads meet the foregoing test criteria, depending on the thickness and density of the pad materials. [0026] FIGS. 1-3, when taken together, show a lower limb protector 100 according to the present disclosure, with greater than 90° circumferential coverage, which can be worn over or under clothing. "Circumferential coverage," as used herein, means the percentage of the limb circumference that is covered by the padding, measured at the widest circumference of the limb for which the protector is intended. The present limb protectors can provide circumferential coverage of greater than 90° and up to about 360°, depending on the construction of the protector, as will be discussed below. [0027] As shown, limb protector 100 includes a front pad 10 and a back pad 12. Each of the front and back pads 10,12 includes an upper edge 16, a lower edge 18 and opposing first and second side edges 20, 22. In the present embodiment, and throughout this description, the reference character "f" will be used with reference to the front pad 10 and the reference character "b" will be used with reference to the back pad 12. Each of the first and second side edges 20f of the front pad 10 includes a plurality of opposing, alternating projecting regions 22f and opposing recessed regions 24f. [0028] Each of the front and back pads 10,12 includes opposing inner surfaces 10i,12i and outer surfaces 10o,12o. A plurality of guide channels 14 is disposed on the inner surfaces lOi, 12i of each of the front and back pads 10,12. The guide channels may be, for example, fabric attached to a liner on the pads. [0029] A connector 26f is attached at both ends to the opposing projecting regions 24f of the front pad 10. Similarly, a connector 26b is attached at both ends to the opposing projecting regions 24b of the back pad 12. In the present embodiment, the connectors 28f,b are elastic straps attached by, for example, stitching, although a variety of other materials could be used for the straps, and a variety of other attachment techniques could be used to attached the connector to the pads, as would be know to those of ordinary skill in the art. [0030] When assembled, the straps 28f are disposed in the guide channels 14b on the inside surface 12i of back pad 12, to which they are not attached; and straps 28b are disposed in the guide channels 14f on the inside surface lOi of front pad 10, to which they are not attached. [0031] In use, the projecting regions 24f of the first side edge 20 correspond to the recessed regions 26b of the second edge 22, and the recessed regions 26 of the first side edge 20 correspond to the projecting regions 24 of the second edge 22, to define a space "S" between the edges. In use, the spacing S increases or decreases in response to the stretching or contracting of the limb protector. In use, a user can expand the limb protector to slide the protector onto their lower limb, and when positioned properly on the lower limb, the user can release the limb protector, such that the straps retract and the protector conforms to the user's lower limb. FIG. 1 shows the limb protector 100 in an expanded position, with a first spacing Si, and FIG. 2 shows the limb protector 100 in a retracted position, with a second spacing S2. [0032] The at least one back pad 30 is positioned on the sleeve to cover the back side of a user's calf, which minimizes or prevents injury to the fibula as a result of a lower leg impact, particularly from behind the user. Limb protector 100 also may include an optional front pad 40 disposed on the front region of the sleeve, in order to provide protection for the tibia bone. [0033] In the present embodiment, the edges of the front and back pads are constructed to have corresponding saw tooth configurations, such that the spacing S increases or decreases in response to the stretching or contracting of the sleeve. [0034] FIGS. 4-5 shows another embodiment of a limb protector 200 according to the present embodiment. Limb protector 200 includes a compression sleeve 30 to which pads are attached; the pads have a sleeve 30 a similar construction to protector 100. In the present embodiment, one or both of the pads are attached to the compression sleeve 30 at a distance from the edges of the pads, such that all or a portion of the pad edges remain free of attachment to the sleeve 30. In the present embodiment, the spacing S increases or decreases in response to the stretching or contracting of the sleeve, and of the straps. [0035] In the present embodiment, the front and back pads 10,12 are attached to the sleeve by, for example, stitching at the upper and lower edges of the pads. The stitching is depicted by zig-zag lines. The upper strap is are attached to the upper side edge of the front pad by stitching, and the strap extends underneath the back pad. Similarly, the lower strap is attached to the lower side edge of the back pad by stitching, and the strap extends underneath the front pad. Optionally, both straps can be disposed in a guide channel, as shown in the previous embodiment, formed on the back of the pads or on the compression sleeve, if desired. [0036] FIG. 6 shows another embodiment of a limb protector 300 according to the present embodiment. Limb protector 200 has a similar construction to that of limb protector 200, and additionally includes a stirrup 40, and opposing left and right ankle pads 50 disposed on the stirrup, adjacent to the ankle. [0037] FIGS. 7-8, when taken together, show another embodiment of a limb protector 400 according to the present disclosure, without a saw-tooth side edge. In the present embodiment, the limb protector includes a tubular compression sleeve 30 having the same construction as the previous embodiment, and front and back pads 10,12. The side edges of pads 10,12 are angled with respect to axis "A," and the edges of the pads are adjacent to and spaced apart from each other by spacing "S," which varies, as previously described. [0038] FIG. 9 shows another embodiment of a lower limb protector 500 according to the present disclosure 100. As in previous embodiments, limb protector 500 includes a compression sleeve 30 and front and back pads 10,12 disposed on the sleeve 30. [0039] Fig. 11 shows another limb protector 600, similar in construction to limb protector 500, but also including a stirrup 40, and opposing ankle pads 50. [0040] FIG. 12 shows another embodiment of a limb protector 700 according to the present disclosure, which includes a tubular compression sleeve 30 having the same construction as protector 200 (see FIG. 4). In the present embodiment, limb protector 700 includes a foot portion 60 extending from the sleeve 30, and a sock overlay 70 connected to the sleeve by a variety of means e.g., by stitching, hook and loop tape, zipper, and the like. In the present example, the sock overlay 70 is attached to the sleeve at the ankle region, by stitching, and can be removably attached to the sleeve at the ankle region and at the upper edge of the sleeve using, for example, hook and loop tape. In use, the sock overlay 70 can be disposed such that the pads are covered by the overlay, and when not in use, it can be removed from the limb protector completely, or pulled down to the ankle region. [0041] The sock overlay may have any aesthetic design intended to appeal to a consumer. For aesthetic purposes, the sleeve, pads and overlay may be the same or different, and also may include text and/or graphics. [0042] Suitable materials for the sleeves can comprise any material capable of providing sufficient elasticity to prevent tearing and/or stretching when a force is applied thereto, and that is capable of withstanding the environment in which it is intended to be used (e.g., repetitive deformations such as twisting, bending, flexing, stretching, and the like), without substantial degradation. The sleeves may be constructed with one or more materials with varying elasticity in order to allow increased expansion of the spacer region "S" when a user is putting on the protectors, or during use, without interference from the fixed pads. [0043] It may be desirable for the pads to be lightweight, and in such instances, the pads may comprise a foam material, such as a low-density foam material. Examples of suitable low- density foams include polyester and polyether polyurethane foams. In some instances, it may be desirable for the pads to be capable of providing impact resistance. In such instances, various types of impact absorbing materials have been found suitable for the pads, particularly energy absorbing or rate dependent materials, including foams. [0044] Optionally, such materials can be made water resistant or waterproof by coating the material with a water resistant or waterproof coating. This can be desirable for open cell foams in particular, to minimize or prevent moisture absorption by the foam. A variety of materials can be used to coat such materials, and the coating can be done using a variety of techniques such as, but not limited to, spray coating, spin coating, dipping, and the like. [0045] One example of a suitable rate dependent foams is available from Rogers Corporation under the brand names PORON® and PORON XRD®, which are open cell, microcellular polyurethane foams. It can be desirable for such foams to have a density ranging from about 5 to about 35 pounds per cubic foot (pcf), more particularly from about 10 to about 30 pcf, and more particularly still from about 15 to about 25 pcf. [0046] Materials for and methods of making the some materials that are useful for the present protectors are disclosed in commonly owned and co-pending U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2012/0084896, filed on August 11, 2011; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In addition to the foregoing, suitable materials for the foregoing layers and the adhesive (if used) are disclosed in the afore -mentioned patent applications, and in U.S. Publication Nos. US 2008/0034614 and US 2009/0255625, which also disclose techniques for manufacturing the present cushion inserts; each of the foregoing publications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. [0047] In any of the foregoing embodiments, the pads and/or straps may be attached to the sleeve by a variety of techniques, such as stitching, welding, gluing, heat-sealing, and the like. Alternatively, the sleeves can comprise pockets for receiving the pads and having a size, shape and thickness corresponding to the size, shape and thickness of the pads. In use, the pads may be interchangeably disposed in the pockets. After use, the pads can be removed, such that they can be removed and interchanged with pads having different functional characteristics, depending on the user's needs. [0048] The size, shape, thickness and material composition of the pads may be varied, depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, desired amount of flexibility, articulation, impact resistance, transmitted force, circumferential coverage, and the like. [0049] All of the foregoing thicknesses, widths, distances and spacings may vary, as desired or necessary to provide a protective or comfortable effect. The thickness of pads may be varied as desired, but it is desirable for the thickness to be minimized while still being sufficient to protect the limb from impact. [0050] The pads may have any shape or configuration as is desired to achieve the desired functional advantages of improved impact protection, reduced force transmission and the aesthetic design intended to appeal to a consumer. The size, shape, quantity, configuration and location of the pads on the sleeves may be varied as desired in order to achieve the foregoing objectives. For aesthetic purposes, the sleeve, pad and/or overlay may be the same or different, may be clear, opaque and/or colored, and also may include text and/or graphics.
