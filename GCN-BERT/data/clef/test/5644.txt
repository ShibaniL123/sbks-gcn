Australian Patents Act 1990- Regulation 3,2 ORIGINAL COMPLETE SPECIFICATION STANDARD PATENT Invention Title Methods and compositions for promoting the neurological de velopment of an infant The following statement is a full description of this invention. performing it known to me/us:- inclu.ding the best method of P/00/01 i 5102 ΐ Methods and compositions for promoting the neurological development of an infant Technics / Field The present invention is directed to methods for promoting the neurological development of an infant by administration of fatty acids and compositions comprising same, wherein the fatty acids are enriched with respect to docosahexaenoic- acid content. Background of the invention Preterm infants and in particular infants bom prior to 33 weeks gestation are at an increased risk for developmental disorders and learning disabilities. Long-term outcome studies of preterm infants show an overall reduction in developmental quotient (DQ) and a poorer performance on tests' of visual-motor integration, spatial relations, quantitative concepts and classroom behaviour compared with reference norms. Such studies suggest that preterm infants may face significant educational and developmental challenges during adolescence and also in later life. There is therefore a need for methods by which the risk of developmental disorders and Seaming disabilities in preterm infants can be minimised or even eliminated. An inadequate nutrient supply in the neonatal period is hypothesized to contribute to the observed poor developmental outcome in preterm infants. The n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is of particular interest in this regard because it is a major lipid in the brain with specific structural and functional roles in neurological development. The uptake of DHA into the developing brain is maximised during the final trimester of pregnancy and as a result preterm infants do not receive the DHA in utero that is received by their full term counterparts. DHA. is known to significantly alter a number of basic properties of cell membranes including permeability, fluidity and interactions with regulatory proteins. One such, property includes a modulating effect on the activity of ion channels which may facilitate electrical signalling, cellular communication and possibly brain functions such as memory, processing and the ability to learn. The present inventors have surprisingly discovered that the neurological development of an infant, can be promoted by administration of an increased daily amount of DBA compared to that considered previously.

However those skilled in the art will appreciate that the scope of the invention, is not so limited and that the compositions and formulas described herein may be administered to infants of any species for the s purposes of nutrition and promoting neurological, development, such as in. laboratory animals, domestic pets, livestock, the young of stud animals and in rare or endangered species, for example as part of conservation measures in zoological parks and gardens. The DHA may be administered, to the infant via an enteral route or a parenteral route depending on the chronological age of the infant, general health of the infant and whether ΐο the infant has commenced enteral feeding. Where the infant has not yet commenced enteral feeding the DHA may be administered parentefally, for example intravenously. Where the infant has commenced enteral feeding the DHA may be administered, enteraily, for example orally. The method of enteral administration selected will often depend on chronological age, birth weight and the clinical condition of the infant. Typically the route is of enteral administration is determined by the infant's ability to co-ordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing. Infants who are less mature, weak or suffering from an illness may require enteral administration via tube or possibly nasogastric-ally or orogastrically. Administration of DHA may commence as soon as possible after the birth of the infant. For example, administration may commence within about 24 hours of the birth of 20 the infant, or within about 12 hours of the birth of the infant, or within about 10 hours of the birth of the infant, or within about 8 hours of the birth of the infant, or within about 6 hours of the birth of the infant, or within about 5 hours of the birth of the infant, or within about 4 hours of the birth of the infant, or within about 3 hours, of the birth of the infant, or within about 2 hours of the birth of the infant, or within about 1 hour of the birth of the 25 infant. In -another embodiment, administration to the infant may commence at a time when the infant commences enteral feeding. For example, DHA may be administered within about 24 hours, or within about 12 hours, or within about 8 hours, or within about 4 hours, or within about 2 hours of the infant commencing enteral feeding. In an alternative so embodiment administration of DHA may commence simultaneously when the infant commences enteral feeding. In a further embodiment, administration may begin while the infant is stil l in uiera. For example, the infant's mother may he identified as being at risk of delivering the infant CODocunicnu a:n! ricuiHg$\«xi\Uscal Seuings'j'cn'ipor 4cy lotcmci Filcs\OLK93\HigiiDH>..»ii-aivcrsio!i (4) doc-2Q/04/2Cr09 12- preteim (risk factors may include smoking), or the infant's mother may have been scheduled to give birth by caesarean section. Alternatively or in addition, the infant, whilst in utero may be identified as being likely to be classified as small for gestational age at birth. In such circumstances- it may be desirable to begin administration of fatty acids in 5 accordance with methods of the invention prior to birth of the infant Such administration will then typically continue beyond birth, as described herein. The commencement of DHA administration may be determined on a case-by-case basis and could depend on a number of factors including for example the number of weeks gestation and the general health of the infant post birth, ΐο Where the infant, is a preterm infant administration may continue until the infant reaches term corrected age. For example, if the infant is bom at 32 weeks: gestation administration of DHA may be continued until the infant reaches what would have been full term. i.e. between 37 and 40 weeks gestation, or in other words until the infant reaches a chronological age of between 5 and 8 weeks. Alternatively, if desired, termination of ΐ s administration may occur at anytime prior to the infant reaching term corrected age. In alternative embodiments DHA may be administered prior to and beyond term corrected age, for example prior to, and up to 24 months after, term corrected age; or prior to, and up to 18 months after, term corrected age; or prior to, and up to 12 months after, term corrected age; or prior to, and up to 6 months after, term corrected age. 20 'Where the. infant is a full term infant and classified as small for gestational age, administration may also commence at a time when the infant commences enteral feeding and may continue for up to 24 months after birth, or up to 18 months after birth, or up to 12 months after birth, or up to 9 months after birth, or up to 6 months after birth, or up to 3 months after birth. 25 Fatty acids administered in accordance with methods described herein, may be administered as part of a composition. Such compositions may take a number of forms that are well known to those skilled in the art including tablets, capsules, caplets, powders, solutions, suspensions and emulsions. The form of the composition is not critical to the invention as long as the infant receives the required amount of DHA. The form of the bo composition will depend on the intended route of administration. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that a number of suitable processes and techniques exist for the manufacture of compositions suitable for enteral and. parenteral administration and that the invention is not limited by reference to any one particular process or technique.

The compositions may be administered to the infant in combination with a source of protein. Protein sources are well known to. those skilled in the art and include milk, whey 5 protein, casein, vegetable protein, animal protein, cereal protein, hydrolysed protein, amino acids, peptides and the. like. In the case of humans, the source of protein may he human milk, infant formula, human milk fortifier or combinations thereof. The composition may also be administered to an infant in combination with various vitamins and/or minerals which are commonly given to preterm infants and infants classified as small for gestational ΐο age. Examples of such vitamins and minerals include, but are not limited to: vitamin A, Β group vitamins (for example vitamins B-j , B3, B5, Bg, Β9 and Β12), vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin Ε, vitamin Κ, vitamin Η, zinc, selenium, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, chloride, manganese, phosphorus, iodine, copper, iron, magnesium, molybdenum and chromium. is In the methods of the invention the D-HA may be administered as part of an infant formula. The compositions' used in the method of the second aspect may be commercially available infant formulas (for example formulas intended for administration to preterm infants) that have been supplemented such that DHA is present in an amount of about .1% or more of the total fatty acid content of the formula (presently available infant formulas typically comprise DHA in an amount of about 0.3% of the total fatty acid content). The DHA supplementation may occur daring manufacture of the formula or alternatively post manufacture. DHA supplementation during manufacture may be performed by replacing the usual fatty acid source or sources with an alternative fatty acid source having the desired DHA content as a percentage of total fatty acids. Alternatively, purified. DHA may 25 simply be added to the formula either during or after manufacture so as to achieve the desired DHA content as a percentage of total fatty acids. The method of the second aspect may involve administering the DB A-supplemented formula according to tire daily dosage regime specified by the manufacturer of the formula so that the infant conveniently receives the specified amount of DHA as a percentage of total fatty acid content at each feed. Suitable infant formulas that may be supplemented and administered in this manner include but are not limited to: S-26 LBW Gold available from Wyeth Nutrition, Baulkham Hills, NSW Australia, Nutriprern available from Nutricia, Macquarie Park, NSW Australia, preterm, formulas sold under the trade name C:\D<xuiuc;i'S am: SeUiiigseixlMoeyl SelimgsXTcinporarylmcroei Filcs\OLK!/3\HiglviDHAfioa:v;'aiiou (4). ck;e-20/04/2009 - 14- Enfamil® by Mead Johnson, Indiana, USA, and preNAN® available from Nestle Australia Ltd, Rhodes, NSW Australia. In an alternative embodiment, the method of the second aspect may involve the use of a DHA-supplemented commercial human milk fortifier which may be intended for 5' administration to preterm infants and which comprises an amount of DHA such that when the fortifier is admixed with an appropriate amount of breast milk, the amount of DHA in the resulting mixture is about 1% or more of the total fatty acid content of the mixture. Typically the amount of DBA added to the human milk fortifier would be calculated on the assumption that mothers consume a minimal amount of DHA-eontaining products .so as to ΐο ensure that when the human milk fortifier is added to different breast milks having a range of different DHA contents, the amount of DHA in the resultant mixtures will always be about 1% or more of the total fatty acid content of the mixture. For example, the average amount of DHA as a percentage of total fatty acids in the milk of mothers consuming a typical western diet is less than 0.3%. Accordingly, the amount of DHA present in the is DHA-supplemented commercial human milk fortifier would be an amount sufficient to increase this percentage to about 1 % or more when admixed with an appropriate amount of breast milk. Suitable commercial human milk fortifiers that may be supplemented and administered in the manner described include but are not limited to: products sold under the trade name Similac® by Abbott Nutrition, Illinois USA, fortifiers sold under the trade 20 name Enfamil® by MeadJohnson, Indiana, USA, S-26 HMF available from Wyeth Nutrition, Bauikham Hills, NSW Australia, and FM-8'5 available from Nestle Australia Ltd, Rhodes, NSW Australia, The method of the first aspect may involve administration to the infant of purified DHA. DHA that is present as part of a mixture of fatty acids or any composition 25 comprising DHA (for example infant formulas and human milk fortifiers), so long as the daily dosage of DHA received by the infant is within the dosage regimes described herein. The source of DHA in the methods, compositions and formulas described herein may be any source known in the art, including plant and marine sources. The plant and marine sources may be genetically modified or non-genetically modified. Marine sources 30 include, but are not limited to: crustaceans such as krill, molluscs such as oysters, and fish such as salmon, trout, sardines, tuna, mackerel, sea bass, menhaden, herring, pilchards, kipper, eel or whitebait. The DHA may be present in a purified form- and/or in the form of an extract from a suitable source. The DHA may be present as a component of fish oil.

The DHA may be stabilised so as to protect against oxidation and other forms of degradation. The stabilisation may be achieved by encapsulation. Suitable encapsulation methods include, but are not limited to: coatings (including primary, secondary and tertiary), emulsions, coacervasion and gels. The DHA may alternatively he stabilised in the form of an emulsion wherein the DHA is either not, or only partially encapsulated. Preterm human infants and human infants classified as small for gestational age are typically able to consume milk and/or formula in an amount between about 100 mL and 250 mL per kg of body weight per day. Accordingly, the method of the second aspect may comprise administration to the infant of milk and/or formula, in an amount between about 100 mL and 250 mL per kg of body weight per day, wherein the DHA content of the milk or formula is about 1% of more of the total fatty acid content of the milk or formula. The milk and/or formula may be administered to the infant once a day or on multiple occasions depending on the infant’s age, general health and feeding regime. As the infant grows, the amount of milk and/or formula can be increased in accordance with the infant ’ s nutritional requirements. In a third aspect, the present invention relates to a method of feeding an infant, the method comprising: (i) administering fatty acids including DHA to the infant’s mother in an amount sufficient to provide a content of DHA in the breast milk of the infant’s mother that is about 1% or more of the total fatty acids present in the breast milk, and (ii) feeding the infant with breast milk following step (i). The infant may be a preterm infant or an infant classified as small for gestational age. The feeding may comprise breast feeding or alternatively bottle feeding using expressed milk from the breast of the infant’s mother. Step (i) may comprise administering fatty acids including DHA to the infant’s mother in an amount sufficient to provide a content of DHA in the breast milk of the infant’s mother that is least 1.3%, or at least i ΐ least 1%, or at least 1.05%, or at least 1.1%, or at least 1.2%, or at ,4%, or at least 1,5%, or at least 1.6%, or at least 1,7%, or at least 1.8%, or at least 1.9%, or at least 2%, or at least 2.1%, or at least 2.2%, or at least 2.3%, or C:\DocuiiKnU and ScUing3\n>.IU-ccal ScuHgsV'fcinporary lnicmcl F:tcs'\C'LK93M-[;g!iD HA final version (^;.doc-26/(U/2009 -16 - at least 2.4%, or at least 2.5%, or at least. 2.6%, or at least 2.7%, or at least 2.8%, or at least 2.9%, or at least 3,0% of the total fatty acids present in the breast milk. Step (i) may comprise administering fatty acids including DHA to the infants mother in an amount sufficient to provide a content of DHA in the breast milk of the Infant’s mother that is between more than 1% and about 20%, or between more than 1.05% and about 20%, or between more than 1.1% and about 20%, or between more than 1% and about 30%, or between more than 1% and about 25%, or: between more than 1% and about 15%), or between more than 1% and about 10%, or between about 1.5% and about 20%, or between about 1.5% and about 15%, or between about 1.5% and about 10%, or between about 1.5% and about 5%, or between about 2% and about 20%, or between about 2% and about 15%, or between about 2℅ and about 10%, of the total fatty acids present in the breast milk. Step (i) may comprise administering fatty acids including DHA to the infant’s mother in an amount and over a time- period sufficient to provide a. constant DHA content in the breast milk of the infant’s mother that is about 1% or more of the total fatty -acids present in the breast milk of the infant’s mother. This outcome may be achieved by administering to the infant’s mother approximately 60.0 mg or more of DHA per day. However, in the case of a mother who consumes minimal DHA as part of her diet, the amount of DHA administered on a daily basis may be approximately 900 mg or more. In the ease of a mother who consumes a diet rich in DHA, it may be possible to achieve a content of DHA in the breast milk of the infant’s mother that is about .1% or more of the total fatty acids present by administering less than 600 mg of DHA. per day. Those skilled in the art will be capable of determining the amount of DHA required to be administered to an infant's mother in order to achieve a desired amount of DHA as a percentage of total fatty acids in breast milk by routine trial and experimentation based, on the teachings herein. In one embodiment, the amount, of DHA administered to the infant's mother may be between about 600 mg per day and about 4000 mg per day, or between about 600 mg per day and about 3500 mg per day, or between about 600 mg per day and about 3000 mg per day, or between about 600 mg per day and about 2500 mg per day, or between about 600 mg per day and about 2000 mg per day; or between about 600 mg per day and about 1500 mg per day, or between about 600 mg per day and about 1200 mg per day. The DHA may be administered in multiple unit dosage forms {such as tablets or C:\Doctuitcoi3 and Scuings'jixl'iLoca!

The DHA may be administered in the form of DHA-rich tuna oil for example the product sold under the trade name HiDHA® available from Nu-Mega Ingredients, Nathan, Queensland Australia. In manipulating the amount of DHA present in the breast milk, the naturally occurring amount of arachadonic acid present (about 0.4% to 0.6%) may not be substantially altered. Step (ii) maybe commenced at any time after step (i). In one embodiment step (ii) commences about 1 week after commencement of step (i) thereby ensuring, that the desired amount of DHA in the breast milk has been reached and is essentially constant. Practically however it is likely that the infant’s .mother will simply commence step (i) whilst continuing the infant’s standard feeding regime. Accordingly, the level of DHA in the breast milk being received by the infant will increase and subsequently be maintained at, or above, the desired level.. The method of the third aspect may commence at anytime after the birth of the infant, and in one embodiment within about 24 hours of the birth of the infant. Commencement of the method will of course be dependent on whether the infant is capable of breastfeeding or bottle feeding expressed milk. Where the infant is unable to commence breastfeeding or bottle feeding soon after birth, the method may be commenced once the infant is able to breastfeed or bottle feed, successfully. In a fourth aspect, the present invention relates to infant formulas comprising fatty acids including DHA, wherein the DHA is present in an amount of about 1% or more of the total fatty add content in the formulas. The infant formulas may be milk fortifiers or formulas intended for use as breast milk replacements or supplements. The DHA may be present in the formulas in an amount of about 1.05% or more, about 1.1% or more, about 1.2% or more, about 1.3% or more, about 1.4% or more, about 1.5% or more, about 1.6% or more, about 1.7% or more, about 1.8% or more, about 1.9% or more, about 2.0% or more, about 2.1% or more, about 2.2% or more, about 2,3% or more, about 2.4% or more, about. 2.5% or more, about 2.6% or more, about 2.7% or more, about 2.8% or more, about 2.9% or more, about 3.0% or more, about 3.1% or more, about 3.2% or more, about 3.3% or more, about 3.4% or more, about 3.5 % or more, about 3.6% or more, about 3.7 % or more, about 3.8% or more, about 3.9% or more, about 4.0% or more, about 4.1% or more, about 4.2% or more, about 4.3% or more, about 4.4% or more, about 4.5% or more, about 4,6% or more, about 4.7% or more, about 4.8% or more, about C:\OocumciUs and Seiungs'iixM.ocaf StftiHgs'Tcoiporary f>k-s'£5L.K93\HigIiDRAii:iHt.vcr5iiJO <4)..tJoc-20/<j4.''J0ό5 -18- 4.9% or more, or about 5.0% or more, of the total fatty acid content of the formulas. In alternative embodiments, the DHA may be present in the- formulas in an amount between more than 1% and about 80%, or between more than 1% and about 70%, or between more than 1% and about 60%, or between more than 1% and about 50%, or 5 between more than 1% and about 40%, or between more than 1% and about 30%, or between more than 1% and about 20%, or between more than 1%. and about 15%, or between more than 1% and about 10%, or between more than 1% and about 8%, or between more than 1% and about 6%, or between more than 1% and about 5%, or between more than 1% and about 4%, or between more than 1% and about 3%, or between more ΐθ than 1% and about 2%, of the total fatty acid content of the formulas. The infant formulas in accordance with the invention will typically be nutritionally complete and include standard ingredients that are present in commercially available infant formulas and milk fortifiers, such as fat,, protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals. The nutritional composition of the formulas and fortifiers may be adjusted depending on the is intended age group to which the formulas and fortifiers are to be administered. For example, in one embodiment the- infant formulas are specialised preterm infant formulas and hence include selected ingredients so as to satisfy the unique nutritional requirements of preterm infants. Alternatively, where the formulas and fortifiers are intended to be administered to infants that are oider than term corrected age, fine nutritional composition 20 may be adjusted to meet the differing nutritional requirements of such infants. The formulas may be in the form of liquids, powders or tablets and may be manufactured according to techniques well known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the infant formulas of the invention may be prepared by supplementing commercially available infant formulas or fortifiers with the desired 25 amount of DHA as described above in connection with the second aspect. Suitable infant formulas that may be supplemented in this manner include, but are not limited to: products sold under the trade name Similac® by Abbott Nutrition, Illinois USA, products sold under the trade name S--26 (for example S-26 LBW Gold and S-26 HMF) available from Wyeth Nutrition, Bauikham Hills, NSW Australia..

The composition may comprise one or more acceptable carriers, diluents and/or adjuvants. The carriers, diluents and adjuvants must be "acceptable" in terms of being compatible with the other components of the composition and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Suitable carriers, diluents and adjuvants will depend on the intended route of administration arid are well known to those skilled in the art. hi one embodiment, the composition may be adapted for parenteral administration. For administration as an 30 injectable solution or suspension non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluents or carriers can include: Ringer's solution, isotonic saline, glucose solution, distilled water and phosphate buffered saline. Methods for preparing parenterally administrable compositions are apparent to those skilled in the art, and are described in more detail in, for example, CADocumenis aid Setluigs'-px^Local Ssuuig&Yfcoipoiiuy fun-niel ftlcriOl.K91\H)ghDHAt'i!ta! version (4) ,1οο-20/0-ν2009 - 20 - Remington's pharmaceutical Science, 15th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of illustration only, with respect to the following examples. The examples are intended to serve to illustrate this invention and should not be construed as limiting the generality of the disclosure of the description throughout this specification. Example - Clinical study Study design and methodology A multi-centre randomized controlled trial was conducted in 5 Australian perinatal centres. Ethics approval was granted by the local Institutional Review Boards (Human Research Ethics Committees) of each centre-. The trial began with a pilot phase at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital Adelaide. A central trial coordinator monitored data collection, entry and checking. An independent serious adverse event committee reviewed all deaths. Infants bom <33 weeks were eligible and families were approached by the research nurses within 5 days of their infant receiving any enteral feeds. Infants were excluded if they had. major congenital or chromosomal abnormalities, were from a multiple birth where not all live born infants were eligible, or were in other trials of fatty acid supplementation. Lactating mothers in whom tuna oil was contraindicated, for example bleeding disorders or therapy with anticoagulants, were also excluded. Once written informed consent was obtained, mother-infant pairs were randomly assigned a unique study number through a computer, driven telephone randomization sendee according to an independently generated randomization schedule. Stratification was by centre, birth weight (<1.2.50g and >1250g) and infant sex. Multiple births were considered a single randomization unit and randomization of twins or triplets was according to the sex and birth weight of the first bom infant. Baseline characteristics, including maternal age, infant race as identified by parents, parental education, birth order, CA.DoctiiiiCiU3 itnd SetuaghnxliLccyl Scui’ngsVTeropowy hUcpK-.t b'ilcsOLK9'Jl'i-f[gbI>HAfir.3ivc::-io:i ('i;.dciC-20,'XK;/.0C9 - 21 - parity, gestational age at birth, birth measurements, pregnancy and birth complications, were recorded, Lactating mothers allocated to the high-DHA group were asked to consume 6 χ 500mg DHA-rich tuna oil capsules per day in order to achieve a breast milk DHA concentration that was «4% of total fatty acids without altering the naturally occurring concentration of arachidonic acid (AA) in breast milk. If supplementary formula was required, infants were given a high-DHA preterm formula («4,0% DHA, 0.6% A A). Mothers with infants allocated to the standard DHA group were asked to consume 6 χ SOOnag placebo, soy oil capsules that did not change the fat content or fatty acid composition of their milk. In the event that mothers chose not to breastfeed or could not produce enough breast milk, infants were fed standard preterm infant formula (4).35% DHA and 0.6% ΑΑ),· To facilitate blinding, each treatment group was separately colour coded into two groups. All capsules were similar in size, shape and colour and were donated by Clover Corporation, Sydney, Australia. If formula was required in the pilot phase, two drops of oil from capsules in matching colour coded containers were added to each 90mL jar of formula. For the remainder of the trial, Mead Johnson Nutritionals, IN, USA, specifically manufactured ready-to-feed preterm formula to trial specifications and packaged the formula according to the colour codes. The intervention continued until infants reached their expected date of delivery (EDD). Infants in the high-DHA group consumed approximately 60 mg/kg of body weight per day of DHA, whereas infants in the standard DHA group consumed approximately 20 mg/kg of body weight per day ofDHA. Whilst in hospital, the feeding regimen, was under the direction of the infant’s clinician and did not interfere with the use of human milk fortifier or supplementary vitamins of minerals. Post-term, breastfeeding mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding and those who had weaned, to formula were encouraged to use a term- formula supplemented with. DHA and A A. Parents were reimbursed the difference in cost between unsupplemented term formula and DHA-supplemented term formula. During the intervention the proportion of parenteral and enteral nutrition, human milk and infant formula intakes, and the frequency of interrupted feeds were documented weekly. Confirmed cases of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis, intra-ventricuiar hemorrhage (IVH), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and oxygen treatment at 36 weeks were also documented.

The Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (B5ID-II)2 evaluates memory, habituation, problem solving, early number concepts and language. MDI at 18 months’ corrected age was chosen as the primary outcome because it represents a robust assessment of mental delays in children, is reasonably correlated with IQ in preterm, children'’ and allows comparison with other relevant studies. The psychomotor development index (PDI), which evaluates control of the gross muscle groups including movements associated with standing, walking, running and jumping, as well as fine motor manipulations involved in prehension, adaptive use of writing implements, and imitation of hand movements, was a secondary outcome. MDI and PDI scores standardized to a. mean of 100 with a standard deviation of 15 (range from 50 to 150). If a child performed below the threshold of the tests for either MDI or PDI, they were- assigned a score of 45. If they were completely untestable because of severe delay, they were assigned a score of 40. At the time of the BSID assessment weight, length and. head circumference were measured and the Home Screening Questionnaire (HSQ)4 'was administered to assess the quality and quantity of cognitive, social and emotional support available to each infant in the home environment Parents, clinicians and all research personnel were blinded to participant study group. The trial was designed to evaluate the effect of high dietary DHA in the preterm period on. infants bom <33 weeks gestation, as well as important subgroups in this heterogeneous population. We also planned a priori to conduct a sub-group analysis based on infant sex because DQ in early childhood often varies according to sex and differences of the order of 5-8 points have been reported. Overall, our recruitment target was 320 infants per group to allow for 10% loss to follow-up, including deaths. All analyses were conducted according to the intention to treat principle. The a priori level of significance was p<0,05. Most of the outcomes were analysed using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)3 to account for the clustering of infants within mother using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Normally distributed outcomes were analysed using a linear GEE, with the difference in means (95% Cl) as the treatment effect. The subgroup analyses were performed via factorial models to allow testing for an interaction between treatment and subgroup. Outcomes that were counts were analysed using Poisson or Negative-Binomial GEE as appropriate, with the ratio of 0:ΥΠοαπ)ΐ℮;ΐϋ· arid Sctriiigfou.hLona!

Binary or categorical data were analysed using log-binomial GEE, with the relative risk (ratio of proportions) (95% Cl) as the treatment effect. In secondary analyses the Bayley outcomes were also adjusted for the potential confounders of maternal education, infant sex, gestational age at delivery and birth order, s An additional adjustment was made for phase of the study, which made little difference to the results. All other outcomes were adjusted for the potential confounders of infant sex and gestational age at delivery. In post hoc analyses we also investigated whether groups differed in the proportion of children with mild (<85) and significant (<7Q) mental delay. Missing data were multiply imputed using regression models (either normal, poisson or 10 binary) with 50 imputations. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different seeds, increasing the number of imputations or adding further terms to the regression models. The results of these sensitivity analyses were similar to those presented here. Results Enrolment for the trial began on April 4, 2001 and ended October 28, 2005. Follow-up commenced on January 17, 2003 and ended September 21, 2007. Adequate data for the analysis of the primary outcome were available on 614 infants, 93.5%. of the infants who were originally enrolled in the trial (92,5% in the high-DHA group and 94.3% in the standard-DHA group). The demographic and clinical characteristics of the infants and their'families at randomization were comparable between the two groups (see Table 1). Median duration of treatment was comparable between the high-DHA (9.4 weeks, inter-quartile range, IQR 7.9 to 1.1.4 weeks) and the standard-DHA (9.4 weeks, IQR 8.0 to 11.6 weeks) groups. Maternal compliance based on capsule returns was 81.1% in the high-DHA group and 81.7% in the standard-DHA group (ρ≈0.88). Mean DHA (±SD) concentration in the milk of women in the high-DHA group was greater than standard treatment (0.85i0.39% vs. 0.25±0.13% total fatty acids, ρ0.0001) as was the mean DHA concentration in the three batches of preterm formula used for the trial (l.ll±0.29% vs. 0.42±0.05% total fatty acids, p<0.0001). The mean. A A (±SD) concentration did not differ between groups for human milk (0.41 ±0.09% vs. 0.40±Q.09% total fatty acids) or preterm infant formula (0.69±0.29% vs.. 0.69±0.22% total fatty acids). At the end of dietary treatment 72% of women in the high-DHA group correctly guessed their group allocation as indicated by more frequent reports of fishy eructations, from the high-DHA group compared with standard treatment (140/322 vs. 24/335, unadjusted relative risk 6.20, 95% C\Do!.uoi-c:<!s aiict 5ΐ ctiir. gs'o: χ t: a I ikljing.-VTciopocjry Interna FilCi\CLK93'\H(gliDHAfmaivc.;Sion (4;.cioc-20/C4/20C9 - 24 ·· confidence interval, Cl, 3.79 to 10.20, ρ0.0001). There were no differences between the groups in maternal report of diarrhea, constipation, nausea or vomiting. The primary outcome of mean Bayley MDI did not differ between the high-DHA and standard-DHA groups (mean difference, MD, 1.9, 95% Cl, -1.0 to 4.7, unadjusted; s MD, 1.6, 95% Cl -1.2 to 4,3, adjusted). A priori sub-group analyses based on the randomization strata showed interactions between dietary treatment and sex, and between dietary treatment and birth weight, The MDI of girls fed the high-DHA diet was significantly higher than girls fed the standard-DHA diet in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses (MD, 4.7, 95% C'l 0.5 to 8.8 unadjusted; MD, 4.5, 95% Cl 0.5 to 8.5 adjusted, io Table 2). The MDI of infants bom <1250g and fed a high-DHA diet to EDD was higher than that of infants fed standard-DHA diets in the unadjusted comparison (MD, 4.7, 95% Cl 0.2 to 9.2). For Bayley PDI there was no significant difference between groups (MD, 0.9, 95% Cl, -1.8 to 3.6). There were no. interactions between diet and sex or between diet and birth weight strata and consequently no differences in PDI between the groups in is either of the birth weight strata or for hoys and girls. At 18 months’ corrected age, the degree of social and cognitive stimulation available in the home environment'did not differ between groups (HSQ score ±SD, 34±4, η=322 in the high-DHA group vs. 34±3, η=335 in the standard-DHA group). Post-hoc analyses indicated that overall fewer infants had significantly delayed mental development with high-DHA diets compared with standard DHA. There were fewer infants bom <1250g in the high-DHA group with mildly delayed mental development and fewer infants bora S3 25Og fed the high-DHA diet with significant mental delay compared with the standard-DH A diet. The secondary clinical outcomes of the infants are shown in Table 2. Blindness and hearing impairment requiring aids were rare. There were no differences in anthropometric measures between the groups except that at 18 months’ corrected age infants who were allocated the high-DHA diet were longer than infants allocated to the standard diet (Table 2). The extent of breastfeeding did. not differ between groups at EDD (Table 2), 4, 12 or 18 months corrected age, Other secondary outcomes also did not differ between groups, 30 but fewer infants fed high-DHA in the preterm period required oxygen treatment at 36 weeks compared with standard DHA treatment after correction for gestational age at birth and sex (Table 2).

Impacts of the high-DHA and standard-DHA diet on various allergy indicators was also assessed at 12 or 18 months corrected age. As shown in Table 3, reductions in the incidence of hayfever, asthma and eczema were all observed in infants on the high-DHA diet. The reduction in hayfever incidence 'was of particular significance (p-value = 0.03), and when analysed more closely the reductions were found to be most dramatic in boys (i .6% on high-DHA compared to 10.9% on standard-DHA; ρ = 0.01).
