Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 3 having substantial crystalline purity was prepared by mixing Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 1 or Form 2, in which the Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 1 or Form 2 was partially soluble in the acetonitrile or the acetone at 40° C. for 14 days. Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 3 having substantial crystalline purity was prepared by mixing Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 1 or Form 2, in which the Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 1 or Form 2 was partially soluble in the acetonitrile or the acetone at 60° C. for 7 days. Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 3 may be characterized by powder diffraction data, single crystal data, or a combination thereof. A sample of Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 3 for powder diffraction analysis was applied as a thin layer, with no prior grinding, to the analysis well of a Scintag×2 Diffraction Pattern System having the following parameters: x-ray source: Cu-Kα; range: 2.00°-40.00° 2θ; scan rate: 1.00 degree per minute; step size: 0.02°; temperature: about 25° C.; wavelength: 1.54178 Å (Cu-Kα). Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 3 is characterized by a powder diffraction pattern with peaks having respective 2θ values of about 6.7° and 21.95° and at least one peak having a respective 28 value of about 8.4°, 15.6°, 18.0°, 18.5°, 19.8° or 20.6°, when measured at about 25° C. with Cu-Kα radiation. It is meant to be understood that peak heights may vary and will be dependent on variables such as the temperature, size of crystal size or morphology, sample preparation, or sample height in the analysis well of the Scintag×2 Diffraction Pattern System. It is also meant to be understood that peak positions may vary when measured with different radiation sources. For example, Cu-Kα1, Mo-Kα, Co-Kα and Fe-Kα radiation, having wavelengths of 1.54060 Å, 0.7107 Å, 1.7902 Å and 1.9373 Å, respectively, may provide peak positions that differ from those measured with Cu-Kα radiation. The term “about” preceding a series of peak positions is meant to include all of the peak positions of the group which it precedes. The term “about” preceding a series of peak positions means that all of the peaks of the group which it precedes are reported in terms of angular positions with a variability of ±0.1° or ±0.01°. Accordingly, for example, the phrase about 6.7° and 21.95° and about 8.4°, 15.6°, 18.0°, 18.5″, 19.8° or 20.6° means about 6.7° and about 21.95° and about 8.4°, about 15.6°, about 18.0°, about 18.5°, about 19.8° or about 20.6° or 6.7°±0.1 and 21.95°±0.01 and about 8.4°±0.1, 15.6°±0.1, 18.0°±0.1, 18.5°±0.1, 19.8°±0.1 or 20.6°±0.1. Peak positions may also be expressed with a variability which accounts for differences between powder x-ray diffractometers, variability between Cu-Kα radiation sources, variability from sample to sample on the same diffractometer, and differences in sample heights in the analysis well. This variability is preferably expressed±0.1°.

The term “disease,” as used herein, means cancer, fibrotic diseases, nociception, restenosis and stenosis, wherein cancer includes bladder, breast, colon, lung, ovarian, prostate, multiple myeloma and osteosarcoma, fibrotic disease includes cystic fibrosis, lung fibrosis and liver cirrhosis, nociception includes cancer-related pain and bone pain associated with bone cancer, restenosis includes restenosis following arterial injury, and stenosis includes pathogenic stenosis of blood vessels.

Treatment or prevention of cancer with a therapeutically effective amount of Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 3 may also comprise administering radiation therapy with at least one chemotherapeutic agent to a patient whose the cancer is not refractory. Treatment or prevention of cancer with a therapeutically effective amount of Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 3 may also comprise administering radiation therapy with at least one chemotherapeutic agent to a patient whose the cancer is refractory. Treatment or prevention of cancer may also comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 3, with or without radiation and with or without a therapeutically effective amount of at least one additional chemotherapeutic agent to a patient who has undergone surgery for treatment of cancer. Treatment or prevention of cancer may also comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of Atrasentan Crystalline Form 3 to a patient whose cancer is refractory to treatment with a chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The therapeutically effective amount of Atrasentan Crystalline Hydrochloride Form 2 may administered concurrently with chemotherapy or radiation therapy or prior to or subsequent to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Other diseases or conditions of bone resulting in net bone loss that may be treated with a therapeutically effective amount of Atrasentan Crystalline Hydrochloride Form 3 include, but are not limited to, post-menopausal osteoporosis, ovariectomy patients, senile osteoporosis, results from long-term treatment with corticosteroids, side effects from glucocorticoid or steroid treatment, Cushings's syndrome, gonadal dysgenesis, periarticular erosions in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Paget's disease, osteohalisteresis, osteomalacia, hypercalcemia of malignancy, osteopenia due to bone metastases, periodontal disease, hyperparathyroidism, osteroperosis from Lupron therapy, and starvation. All of these conditions are characterized by bone loss resulting from an imbalance between the degradation of bone (bone resorption) and the formation of new healthy bone. This turnover of bone continues normally throughout life and is the mechanism by which bone regenerates. However, these conditions will tip the balance towards bone loss such that the amount of bone resorbed is inadequately replaced with new bone, resulting in net bone loss. Accordingly, a therapeutically effective amount of Atrasentan Hydrochloride Crystalline Form 3 may be administered to a patient having net bone loss along with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that inhibits net bone loss such as, for example, a bisphosphonate such as, for example, alendronate (Fosamax®), etidronate (Didrocal®) and risedronate (Actonel®), hormone replacement therapy (HRT), ipriflavone, vitamin D3 or tetracycline and flurbiprofen. The foregoing is meant to be illustrative of the invention and not meant to limit it to disclosed embodiments.
