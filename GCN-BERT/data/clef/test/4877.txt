The present application relates to a novel and efficient process for preparing novel substituted 5-fluoro-1H-pyrazolopyridines of the formula (VI) which serve as an intermediate for production of medicaments and for production of medicaments for treatment and/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders. More particularly, the 5-fluoro-1H-pyrazolopyridines of the formula (VI) are suitable for preparation of compound of the formula (I) which serves for production of medicaments and for production of medicaments for treatment and/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders. The compound of the formula (I) acts as a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase and can be used as an agent for prophylaxis and/or treatment of cardiovascular disorders, for example for treatment of hypertension and heart failure, stable and unstable angina pectoris, peripheral and cardiac vascular disorders, of arrthythmias, for treatment of thromboembolic disorders and ischaemias such as myocardial infarction, stroke, transitory and ischaemic attacks, peripheral perfusion disorders, prevention of restenoses such as after thrombosis therapy, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), bypass, and for treatment of arteriosclerosis, asthmatic disorders and diseases of the urogenital system, for example prostate hypertrophy, erectile dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, glaucoma, pulmonary hypertension, gastroparesis, scleroderma and incontinence. The compound of the formula (I) may be present in various crystal forms and solvates. The compound of the formula (I) exists in five polymorphs with melting points 257° C. (polymorph I), 253° C. (polymorph II), 247° C. (polymorph III), 246° C. (polymorph IV), 234° C. (polymorph V), a dimethylformamide/water solvate (DMF content 13.6%, water content 0.9%), a di-dimethyl sulphoxide solvate (stoichiometric value: 26.8% DMSO), a triacetic acid solvate (29.7% acetate), a monohydrate (4.1% water) and a dihydrate (7.8% water). The prior art, WO 2011/147809, describes the compound of the formula (I) in Example 1 as a substance. The crystal polymorph of the compound of the formula (I) in polymorph (I) is notable for stability and particularly for the fact that it is stable even in the micronization process and thus no conversion and recrystallization takes place. The di-dimethyl sulphoxide solvate of the compound of the formula (I) has the advantage of much better filterability than the substance in the prior art. Furthermore, the preparation process via the di-dimethyl sulphoxide solvate of the compound of the formula (I) leads to a very high purity of the compound of the formula (I). WO 03/095451, WO 2011/064156 and WO 2011/064171 disclose the synthesis of pyrazolopyridines unsubstituted on the pyridine ring. In these disclosures, the bicyclic ring system is built up by reaction of phenylbenzyl hydrazine with ethyl cyanopyruvate. This synthesis method is unsuitable for the formation of 5-fluoro-1H-pyrazolopyridines. WO 2009/018415 describes the synthesis of 5-fluoro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-3-amine E. Selective dechlorination of the nicotinic acid A to give the compound B, subsequent conversion to the amide C, the reduction thereof to the nitrile and the final cyclization with hydrazine hydrate form the 5-fluoro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine core. Scheme 1 below illustrates the synthesis. A disadvantage of this process is that, proceeding from 5-fluoro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine E, further steps such as the diazotization reaction and conversion to the iodo compound, followed by an alkylation with a benzyl derivative and subsequent functionalization for introduction of the cyano group are required in order to obtain the desired 5-fluoro-1H-pyrazolopyridines of the formula (VI). This is illustrated by way of example in Scheme 2. A further disadvantage is that the diazotization is conducted under anhydrous conditions and the diazonium salt has to be isolated, which necessitates considerable safety precautions on conversion to the industrial scale and thus causes high production costs. A further disadvantage is that the alkylation with a benzyl derivative proceeds unselectively and the product is obtained in only a low yield after complex purification and separation of the isomers. A further disadvantage is that, in the course of cyanation, toxic copper cyanide has to be handled, which necessitates additional safety precautions in the preparation and in the disposal of mother liquors and aqueous phases, and thus causes high production costs. A further disadvantage is that the preparation of 5-fluoro-1H-pyrazolopyridines of the formula (VI), according to the process described in Scheme 1, entails the preparation and purification of seven intermediates and affords only a small overall yield. It is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient process with high yield for preparation of 5-fluoro-1H-pyrazolopyridines of the formula (VI) as a key component for an efficient process with high yield for preparation of compound of the formula (I) and the N-oxides, salts, solvates, salts of N-oxides and solvates of the N-oxides and salts thereof. This object is achieved in accordance with the present invention, as follows. Scheme 3 below illustrates the individual reaction steps by way of example. Step a) is already known for the unsubstituted pyrazolopyridines through (WO 03/004503 (Example IIIb) and WO 03/095451 (Example 2A)): Compared to the prior art (WO 03/004503, Example IIIb and WO 03/095451, Example 2A), the preparation of IV proceeds with a much higher yield. A further advantage is that, rather than the corrosive trifluoroacetic acid, ethanol, which is much less expensive, is used as the solvent. A further advantage is that the reaction time is considerably shorter compared to the prior art. A further advantage is that the preparation of IV proceeds with high selectivity and the product is formed in high purity without significant by-product formation, and no complex purification procedures are required. A further advantage is that IV is obtained by crystallization in high yield and purity. Steps d)-g) are already known for the unsubstituted pyrazolopyridines through WO 03/095451, WO 2011/064156 and WO 2011/064171 and can be used analogously. Specifically, the process according to the invention for preparing a compound of the formula (VI) comprises the cyclization of the 5-aminopyrazole derivative (IIa) in which T1 is (C1-C4)-alkyl, in the presence of a suitable acid with the aldehyde (III) in which R1 and R2 are each independently methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, phenyl or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, are to give the ester of the formula (IVa) in which T1 is as defined above, the subsequent reaction thereof with ammonia or formamide to give the amide of the formula (V) and the subsequent dehydration to give the nitrile (VI). The present invention further provides for the use of the compound of the formula (VI) for preparation of the compound of the formula (I) and the N-oxides, salts, solvates, salts of N-oxides and solvates of the N-oxides and salts thereof. The present invention further provides for the use of the compound of the formula (III) in which R1 and R2 are each independently methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, phenyl or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, are for preparation of the compound of the formula (I) and the N-oxides, salts, solvates, salts of N-oxides and solvates of the N-oxides and salts thereof. The present invention further provides for the use of the compound of the formula (VI) for preparation of the compound of the formula (I) as specified above, wherein the compound of the formula (VI) is converted to the compound of the formula (VII) the latter is subsequently reacted in an inert solvent in the presence of a suitable base with the compound of the formula (VIIIa) to give the compound of the formula (VIII) and then the latter is reduced in an inert solvent in the presence of a suitable reducing agent to give the compound (IX) then the latter is reacted in the presence of a suitable base in the presence or absence of a solvent with methyl chloroformate or with dimethyl dicarbonate to give the compound of the formula (I) and the resulting compound of the formula (I) is optionally converted with the appropriate (i) solvents and/or (ii) acids or bases to the solvates, salts and/or solvates of the salts thereof. The conversion (VI)→(VII) is effected by methods known to those skilled in the art in a two-stage process, first to form the imino ester with sodium methoxide in methanol at 0° C. to +40° C. and then nucleophilic addition of one ammonia equivalent, for example ammonia or ammonium chloride, in acetic acid or an alcohol to form the amidine (VII) at +50 to +150° C.

Preference is given to triethylamine. The reaction (VII)+(VIIIa) (VIII) is generally conducted within a temperature range of +20° C. to +150° C., preferably at +80° C. to +120° C., optionally in a microwave. The conversion can be effected at standard, elevated or reduced pressure (for example from 0.5 to 5 bar). In general, standard pressure is employed. The compound of the formula (VIIIa) can be prepared analogously to the literature L. F. Cavalieri, J. F. Tanker, A. Bendich, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1949, 71, 533. The reductions (VIII)→(IX) are effected in the presence of a suitable catalyst in an inert solvent within a temperature range of +20° C. to +100° C. under hydrogen pressure (for example from 1 to 100 bar). Preference is given to a temperature range of 40° C. to 80° C. and a hydrogen pressure range of 5 to 70 bar. Inert solvents for the reduction (VIII)→(IX) are, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol, ethers such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, or other solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), N,N′-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), pyridine, acetonitrile or else water. It is likewise possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned. Preference is given to DMF and pyridine. Suitable catalysts for the conversion (VIII)→(IX) are, for example, palladium on activated carbon, platinum on carbon, palladium hydroxide or Raney nickel. The reduction (VIII)→(IX) can alternatively be effected with a metal or metal salt, for example iron, zinc or tin(II) chloride in a suitable acid, for example hydrogen chloride/hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or acetic acid, within a temperature range of +20° C. to +140° C. Inert solvents for process step (IX)→(I) are, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene, hydrocarbons such as benzene, xylene, toluene, hexane, cyclohexane or mineral oil fractions, or other solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), N,N′-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), acetonitrile, ethyl acetate or else water. It is likewise possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned. Preference is given to isopropanol and tetrahydrofuran, and to a mixture of isopropanol and tetrahydrofuran. Suitable bases for the process step (IX)→(I) are alkali metal hydrides such as sodium hydride, alkali metal hydroxides, for example lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates such as lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or caesium carbonate, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates such as sodium hydrogencarbonate or potassium hydrogencarbonate, alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide or potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide or potassium ethoxide or potassium tert-butoxide, or organic amines such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN). Preference is given to triethylamine. The reaction (IX)→(I) is generally conducted within a temperature range of −10° C. to +70° C., preferably at 0° C. to +50° C. The conversion can be effected at standard, elevated or reduced pressure (for example from 0.5 to 5 bar). In general, standard pressure is employed. Compounds of the formula (IIa) are known from the literature and can be prepared in analogy to Example 20A in WO 00/06569. Compounds of the formula (III) are known from the literature H. Yamanaka, S. Yamashita and T. Ishihara, Synlett 353-354 (1993). The synthesis disclosed therein is illustrated in Scheme 4. A disadvantage of this process is that, in the preparation of (XVIb), according to H. Yamanaka, M. Kuwabara, M. Okudo, K. Fukunishi and M. Nomura, Nippon Kagaku Kaishi (10) 1988-1994 (1985), only a yield of 66% is achieved and, in this process, very large amounts (2.79 kg per kg of (XVIb)) of by-product (dimethyldibenzyl nitrobenzenesulphonate) are obtained, which have to be removed and disposed of. A further disadvantage of this process is that, according to H. Yamanaka, H. Ganbayashi, M. Kuwabara, K. Fukunishi and M. Nomura, Nippon Kagaku Kaishi (7) 1036-1043 (1988), proceeding from (XVIb), the alkylation requires 10 equivalents of the carcinogenic alkylating agent methyl iodide. A further disadvantage of this process is that, according to H. Yamanaka, S. Yamashita and T. Ishihara, Synlett 353-354 (1993), the reaction of 0 with morpholine forms not only the desired product (Mb) but also 11% of the by-product (IIIa), which necessitates a complex purification, the result being that the overall synthesis for preparation of (Mb) gives only a low overall yield and causes high production costs. The synthesis described therein, however, is unsuitable for the preparation of the aldehydes of the formula (III) on the industrial scale, and so a new and efficient synthesis has been developed, which is illustrated by way of example in Scheme 5. The compound of the formula (XIII) is known according to the literature Markovskii, L. N.; Kolesnik, N. P.; Shermolovich, Yu. G Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii (1980), 50(4), 826-829. The synthesis disclosed therein is illustrated in Scheme 6. The synthesis described therein, however, for reasons including the low yield, is unsuitable for the preparation of the aldehydes of the formula (III) on the industrial scale. The present invention further provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (III) in which R1 and R2 are each independently methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, phenyl or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, are wherein trifluoromethanesulphonic anhydride of the formula (X) is reacted with 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propanol of the formula (XI) without solvent and the resulting 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl trifluoromethanesulphonate of the formula (XII) is reacted with a compound of the formula (XIIa) in which R1 and R2 are each as defined above to give a compound of the formula (XIIIa) in which R1 and R2 are each as defined above and with methyl methanesulphonate to give a compound of the formula (XIVa) in which R1 and R2 are each as defined above and with sodium hydroxide to give a compound of the formula (XVa) in which R1 and R2 are each as defined above and finally converted under basic conditions to give the compound of the formula (III). The present invention further preferentially provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (IIIa) wherein trifluoromethanesulphonic anhydride of the formula (X) is reacted with 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propanol of the formula (XI) without solvent and the resulting 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl trifluoromethanesulphonate of the formula (XII) is reacted with morpholine to give a compound of the formula (XIII) and with methyl methanesulphonate to give a compound of the formula (XIV) and with sodium hydroxide to give a compound of the formula (XV) and finally with addition of morpholine to give the compound of the formula (III). The new synthesis has the advantage over the prior art that the intermediate (XII) and the intermediates (XIV) and (XV) unknown to date need not be isolated, which greatly reduces the industrial complexity of the synthesis. The yields of the resulting aldehydes of the formula (III) are much higher with the new synthesis process than in the prior art. “Basic conditions” in the context of the invention for the process step (XIVa) to (XVa) means that the acid formed in the reaction is scavenged by auxiliary bases, for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, or triethylamine to form the corresponding salts. Compared to the prior art, the preparation of (XIII) proceeds with a much higher yield. It is advantageous that no solvent is required for preparation of (XII), and that the intermediate XII is used without further purification in the subsequent stage to give (XIII). A further advantage of this process is that no significant wastes are formed in the preparation of (XIII). It is also advantageous that the trifluoromethanesulphonic acid and morpholine can be recovered from the morpholinium trifluoromethanesulphonate formed. Compared to the prior art, the preparation of (XIV) requires only one equivalent of the alkylating agent. The reaction is conducted without solvent and proceeds virtually quantitatively, which achieves a high space-time yield. A further advantage of this process is that the product (XIV) is not isolated, (XIV) is dissolved in water and this solution is reacted with sodium hydroxide solution to give (XV). A further advantage of this process is that the product (XV) is also not isolated; reaction of the aqueous solution with morpholine affords (IIIa) as the sole product in high yield. A further advantage of this process is that (IIIa) is obtained in high overall yield and purity by crystallization. The cyclization of the 5-aminopyrazole derivative of the compound (IL) with the aldehyde of the compound (III) to give the compound of the formula (IV) is effected in an inert solvent, optionally in the presence of an acid and optionally of an alkali metal salt, within a temperature range of +10° C. to +200° C., preferably at +20° C. to +100° C., at standard pressure, within, for example 2 to 50 hours, preferably within 2 to 20 hours. Acids are, for example, hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid and methanesulphonic acid. Preference is given to methanesulphonic acid and hydrochloric acid. Alkali metal salts are sodium chloride or lithium chloride. A preferred alkali metal salt is lithium chloride. Inert solvents are, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol, n-butanol, ethers such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane or mineral oil fractions or other solvents, acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide, or mixtures of solvents. Preference is given to ethanol, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether or dioxane. The preferred formation of the amide (IVa)→(V) is effected by reaction in an inert solvent with formamide in the presence of a base within a temperature range of 0° C. to +150° C., preferably of +20° C. to +130° C., at standard pressure or elevated pressure, within 2 to 24 hours. Inert solvents are, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol. Preference is given to ethanol. Suitable bases for the preferred process step (IVa)→(V) are alkali metal carbonates such as lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or caesium carbonate, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates such as sodium hydrogencarbonate or potassium hydrogencarbonate, alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide or potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide or potassium ethoxide or potassium tert-butoxide, or organic amines such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN). Preference is given to sodium methoxide and sodium ethoxide. The formation of the amide (IVa)→(V) is alternatively effected by reaction with ammonia within a temperature range of 0° C. to +50° C., preferably of +20° C. to +30° C., at standard pressure or elevated pressure, within 24 to 72 hours. Inert solvents are, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol. Preference is given to using a solution of ammonia in methanol in a concentration of 5N to 7N. The dehydration of the amide (V) to the nitrile (VI) is effected in an inert solvent, optionally in the presence of a suitable base, with a suitable dehydrating agent, for example phosphorus oxychloride, trifluoroacetic anhydride, acetic anhydride or trifluoromethanesulphonic anhydride, within a temperature range of 0° C. to +150° C., preferably at +50° C. to +110° C., within 1 to 12 hours. Preference is given to phosphorus oxychloride. Inert solvents are ethers such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), glycol dimethyl ether or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane or mineral oil fractions or other solvents, pyridine, sulpholane, acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide, or mixtures of solvents. Preference is given to sulpholane and acetonitrile. Suitable bases are, for example, organic amines such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN).
