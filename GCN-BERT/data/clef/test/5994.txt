CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a non-provisional of and claims priority to provisional U.S. Application No. 61/554,359, filed Nov. 1, 2011, and entitled “Dispensing Machine Sanitization Using Electrochemically Activated Liquid,” the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This disclosure relates generally to generating and using electrochemically activated liquids, such as electrochemically activated water, for sanitization of dispensing systems, e.g., free-flowing food dispensing systems, such as beverage dispensers used in cafeterias, restaurants (including fast food restaurants), theatres, convenience stores, gas stations, and other entertainment and/or food service venues. BACKGROUND Dispensing systems, e.g., free-flowing food dispensing systems, including beverage dispensers, periodically need to be sanitized. Traditional methods of sanitizing dispensing systems utilize disinfecting liquids, which typically include antimicrobial agents, liquid detergents, and surfactants. A disadvantage of conventional systems is related to the need for reloading or recharging the conventional disinfecting and cleaning liquids to a sanitizing system. The reloading or recharging of disinfecting and cleaning liquids complicates system maintenance and hinders automation of sanitizing process. Therefore, there is a need for new disinfection and sanitization apparatus and methods that would eliminate the need for reloading of disinfecting and cleaning liquids as in existing apparatuses and methods. Further, eliminating the need for reloading of disinfecting and cleaning liquids, and would also enable easier automation of sanitization of beverage dispensing systems. SUMMARY In one aspect the present disclosure provides an apparatus comprising a dispensing system in combination with a sanitizing system. The combination has a dispensing mode and sanitizing mode. The dispensing system comprises a first valve and at least one component, the at least one component comprising an inner surface. The first valve has an open position to send a free-flowing material to the at least one component when the combination is in the dispensing mode. The first valve has a closed position when the combination is in the sanitizing mode. The sanitizing system comprises a processing unit. The processing unit comprises an electrochemical cell configured to produce an anolyte solution and a catholyte solution, a first tank configured to receive the anolyte solution, and a second tank configured to receive the catholyte solution. The sanitizing system comprises a second valve. The second valve has an open position to send the anolyte solution from the first tank and the catholyte solution from the second tank to the at least one component when the combination is in the sanitizing mode. The second valve has a closed position when the combination is in the dispensing mode. The above and other aspects, features and advantages of the present disclosure will be apparent from the following detailed description of the illustrated embodiments thereof which are to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows apparatus in accordance with at least one aspect of the present disclosure comprising a dispensing system and an integrated sanitizing system. FIG. 2 shows a portion of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1 in accordance with at least one aspect of the present disclosure. FIG. 3 shows apparatus in accordance with at least one aspect of the present disclosure comprising a dispensing system and an integrated sanitizing system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure relates to sanitizing and/or cleaning systems, and more particularly to systems that generate a working liquid that has cleaning and/or sanitizing properties. In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, electrochemical activation of a liquid, e.g. water, may be used to generate a working liquid that has cleaning and/or sanitizing properties. In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, electrochemical processes may be performed in a processing, e.g., and an electrolyzer. Electrochemical processes in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure may comprise: a. oxidation of water at the anode: 2H2O−4e=4H++O2;b. reduction of water at the cathode: 2H2O+2e=H2+2OH−;c. formation of gaseous chlorine in chloride solutions at the anode: 2Cl−=2e+Cl2;d. formation of highly active oxidants in an anodic chamber: Cl2O, ClO2, ClO−, HClO, Cl., O2., O3, HO2, OH.; ande. formation of highly active reductants in a cathodic chamber: OH−, H3−, O2−, H2, HO2., HO2−, O2−. In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, an anolyte solution may be generated, and a catholyte solution may be generated. A sufficient amount of strong oxidants and free radicals in an anolyte solution provide antimicrobial properties. Catholyte solution comprising a sufficient amount of reductants provides washing properties. Anolyte and catholyte solutions have considerable change in pH and oxidation reduction potential (“ORP”) with respect to their initial values in water: in an anolyte solution, pH value is reduced and ORP is elevated up to the extreme positive (oxidant) value; in a catholyte solution, pH is increased and ORP is reduced to the extreme negative (reductant) value. The magnitude of the change depends on initial mineralization of the water and parameters of an electrolyzing process. In accordance with at least one aspect of the present disclosure, a regular water supply may be used in combination with a device for electrochemical activation of water. The electrochemically activated water may be used to eliminate the need for reloading of conventional disinfecting and cleaning liquids. The electrochemically activated water may be used to also enable easier automation of sanitization of free-flowing or liquid dispensing systems. Liquid dispensing systems may comprise free-flowing food dispensing systems, e.g. beverage dispensing systems. In accordance with at least one aspect of the present disclosure, effective integration of a unit for production of electrochemical water solution with a liquid dispensing system may be provided, and the integration or combination can be used to provide reliable and automated sanitization. An aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a fully automated sanitizing system that modifies properties of water in such a way that the water acquires disinfecting and/or cleaning properties. As a result the sanitizing system does not require any consumable disinfecting and/or cleaning materials. In an embodiment, water can be modified or treated in such way that the water acquires antimicrobial and cleaning properties as a result of electrochemical activation of the water. In an embodiment, electrochemical activation may occur in an electrolyzer. The electrochemically-activated water may be pumped through a liquid dispensing system in order to sanitize and clean the inner surface(s) of pipes, chambers, reservoirs, pumps, valves and other components of the dispensing system. Use of regular a water supply can eliminate the need for reloading of disinfecting and cleaning liquids, thus enabling easier automation of the sanitization process. A benefit of the present disclosure is that disinfecting and washing solutions can be produced from a conventional drinking water source, e.g., municipal tap water. A benefit of the present disclosure is that electrochemically-activated water can be safer for consumers and operators than conventional disinfecting and/or cleaning materials typically used for sanitization of beverage dispensing systems. Thus, a residual amount of electrochemically-activated water in a beverage dispensing system after a sanitizing procedure is completed can be safer than a residual amount of conventional disinfecting and/or cleaning materials typically used for sanitization of beverage dispensing systems. In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, a sanitization method comprises (1) subjecting a liquid to electrochemical treatment for time sufficient to provide electrochemical activation of the liquid and produce ions in the liquid, and (2) sending the electrochemically-activated liquid through a beverage dispensing system. In an embodiment, the liquid comprises water. Pumping the electrochemically-activated liquid through the beverage dispensing system can be arranged in such way that the electrochemically-activated liquid, e.g., electrochemically-activated water, circulates though the beverage dispensing system and returns to the sanitizing system. By re-circulating the electrochemically-activated liquid, the liquid may again be subjected to electrochemical treatment to replenish ions and chemical radicals in the liquid, and the electrochemically-activated liquid may be sent again through the beverage dispensing system. Alternatively, a single pass of the electrochemically-activated liquid water through the dispensing system can be arranged. After the sanitizing procedure is completed, used liquid, e.g., water, may be disposed into a drain, or further treated as may be desired. In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, a method for modifying water may be provided such that the water acquires antimicrobial and cleaning properties. In an embodiment, water properties may be modified by saturation of water with ions and chemical radicals produced by electrochemically activating water. In an embodiment, liquid properties can be modified by saturation of the liquid or water with ions and chemical radicals produced by an electrochemical cell. Electrochemically-activated liquid produced by the electrochemical cell may be pumped through a liquid dispensing system in order to sanitize and clean the inner surface(s) of pipes, chambers, reservoirs, pumps, valves and other components of the dispensing system. Use of regular water supply may eliminate the need for reloading of disinfecting and cleaning liquids, thus enabling easier automation of sanitizing process. The sanitizing method may comprise producing an anolyte solution and a catholyte solution, and pumping those solutions through liquid dispensing system at different times or at the same time. In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, an electrochemically-activated liquid, e.g., electrochemically-activated water, may be generated by a processing unit or electrochemical cell and may be circulated inside a beverage dispensing system. In an embodiment, electrochemically-activated water may be circulated inside the beverage dispensing system for a sufficient time to provide sanitization of the beverage dispensing system so that free-flowing material, such as free-flowing food (e.g., a beverage) can be dispensed from the dispensing system without being contaminated by components of the dispensing system, or other materials within components of the dispensing system. In accordance with at least one aspect of the present disclosure, electrochemically-activated water may be circulated inside the beverage dispensing system for not longer than 30 minutes before it is disposed to a drain or may be returned to the processing unit for replenishment of ions and chemical radicals. By maintaining circulation of the electrochemically-activated water to not longer than 30 minutes may provide greater antimicrobial efficacy of the ozone-containing water than circulating the electrochemically-activated water for longer than 30 minutes. After the electrochemically-activated liquid or electrochemically-activated water is circulated inside the beverage dispensing system for sufficient time for the beverage dispensing system to be sanitized, the electrochemically-activated water may be either returned to the electrochemical cell, or disposed to a drain. Disposing the electrochemically-activated water to the drain after one pass, and generating a new electrochemically-activated water to circulate through the beverage dispensing system may provide better antimicrobial efficacy than simply recirculating the older electrochemically-activated water through the beverage dispensing system. An embodiment of a sanitizing system 100 in accordance with the present disclosure is shown in FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 1, sanitizing system 100 may be integrated with a liquid or beverage dispensing system 121. The beverage dispensing apparatus or system 121 may be used to dispense a concentrated beverage. The beverage dispensing system 121 may comprise a container 120, with concentrate 101, mixer 107, pumps 103 and 109, dispensing nozzle 112, and valves 102, 104, 105, 108, 110, 111. The sanitizing system 100 may comprise a processing unit or electrochemical cell 115, an input valve 114, an output valve 116, and a pump 118. Electrochemical cell 115 may comprise an electrolyzer. When the beverage dispensing system 121 is in a dispensing mode, valves 106, 110 and 114 may be closed. In the dispensing mode, pump 103 may move concentrate 101 from container 120 into mixer 107, and valves 102 and 104 may be open. Water may be delivered to the mixer 107 from the water supply 117 and through valve 105. Water supply 117 may be any conventional drinking water supply, e.g., municipal tap water. After mixing in the mixer 107, the mixture of concentrate 101 and water may be pumped to nozzle 112 by pump 109, and further into a cup or other container (not shown) placed under nozzle 112. In a sanitizing mode, valve 102 may be closed so that concentrate 101 does not flow from container 120 to pump 103. Valve 114 may be open or opened and water from water supply 117 may be directed into electrochemical cell 115. Electrochemical cell 115 may be configured to produce two solutions: an anolyte solution 116 and a catholyte solution 124. Anolyte solution 116 may be stored in tank 122, and catholyte solution 124 may be stored in tank 123. When a sufficient amount of each solution may be produced, valve 118 may be opened and pump 120 may move the anolyte solution 116 into the dispensing system 121, e.g., through valve 106. At the same time pumps 109 and 103 may also be put into operation to move the anolyte solution 116 along the dispensing system 121 and across internal surfaces of components of the dispensing system. The anolyte solution may pass through components of the dispensing system 121, for example, but not by way of limitation, pump 103, mixer 107 and pump 109. The anolyte solution may then be sent to drain 113. For this embodiment, valve 111 may be closed and valve 110 may be open when the apparatus is in the sanitizing mode. When a predetermined amount of anolyte may be pumped through the dispensing system, valve 118 may be closed, and valve 125 may be opened so that pump 120 may move the catholyte solution 124 through the dispensing system in the same manner as done for the anolyte solution 116. After a predetermined amount of the catholyte solution 124 may be pumped through the dispensing system, valve 125 may be closed, and the dispensing system may then be ready for operation in the dispensing mode. In an alternative embodiment, the order may be reversed and a predetermined amount of the catholyte solution 124 may be pumped through the dispensing system 121, and then a predetermined amount of the anolyte solution 122 may be pumped through the dispensing system 121. In an embodiment, electrochemical cell 115 may comprise a first electrochemical cell (not shown) and a second electrochemical cell (not shown). In an embodiment, the first electrochemical cell may produce the anolyte solution 122, and the second electrochemical cell may produce the catholyte solution 124. In an embodiment, the first electrochemical cell may produce the anolyte solution 122, and the second electrochemical cell may produce the catholyte solution 124 at the same time or about the same time. Thus, the anolyte solution 116 may be accumulated in tank 122 at the same time or about the same time that the catholyte solution 124 may be accumulated in tank 123. In an embodiment, both the anolyte solution 116 and the catholyte solution 124 may be received by pump 120 at the same time or about the same time, and then sent through the dispensing system 121 at the same time or about the same time. In an embodiment, the anolyte solution 116 and the catholyte solution 124 may be directed through the nozzle 112 to disinfect or sanitize interior surfaces of the piping leading to valve 111, interior surfaces of valve 111, and interior surfaces of nozzle 112. In this embodiment, a receiving plate 119 may be connected to the drain 113, as shown in FIG. 2. Thus, disinfecting or sanitizing water may be directed through nozzle 112 to receiving plate 119, and through valve 210, as shown in FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 1, the sanitizing system 100 may comprise an electrochemical cell 115, a tank 122 for an anolyte solution 116, a tank 123 for a catholyte solution 124, input valve 114, output valves 118 and 125, and a pump 120. As shown in FIG. 1, output valve 118 corresponds to the outlet of tank 122, and output valve 125 corresponds to the outlet of tank 123. In an embodiment, a controller 126 may control operation of the sanitizing system 100, including components thereof. In an embodiment, controller 126 may control dispensing system 121, including components thereof. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognized that in accordance with the present disclosure, in an embodiment, flow rates, and operation the electrochemical cell(s) may be coordinated or controlled in an amount and manner that desirable ion and chemical radical concentration in water is achieved. In an embodiment, processing unit 115 may be utilized to clean water from water supply 117. In an embodiment, processing unit 115 can be utilized not only for production of anolyte and catholyte solutions to sanitize the dispensing system 121, but also may be used to clean water from the water supply 117. As shown in FIG. 3, in such an embodiment, processing unit 115 will ultimately have two outputs or outlets, one outlet 209 containing anolyte and/or catholyte solution(s) to sanitize the dispensing system 121, and a second outlet 401 containing water, where ions and chemical radicals produced by processing unit 115 may be removed by apparatus 403, thereby resulting cleaner water than water from water supply 117. As shown in FIG. 3, water treated by processing unit 115 may exit unit 115 through valve 402 and second outlet 401. The water may be sent through valve 404 and into apparatus 403. In apparatus 403, ions and chemical radicals in the water may be removed, and water treated in apparatus 403 may exit apparatus 403 through valve 406 and outlet 405. As shown in FIG. 3, water treated in apparatus 403 may be used as a water supply 407 to mixer 107. Water supply 407 may be used in combination with water supply 117 to supply water to mixer 107, or may be used as an alternative water supply to mixer 107. Water supply 407 may flow through valve 408 before flowing into mixer 107. A pump 409 may be used to send water from processing unit 115 to apparatus 403. A pump 410 may be used to pump water from apparatus 403 to mixer 107. Thus, water treated in apparatus 403 may be used as a water supply 407 to mixer 107, and be combined with concentrate 101 when desired to prepare a beverage using water that has been cleaned using the combination of processing unit 115 and apparatus 403. Those of skill in the art will recognize that in accordance with the present disclosure, any suitable apparatus 403 may be used to remove from water ions and chemical radicals produced by processing unit 115. For example, apparatus 403 may be the same or similar to processing unit 115. For example, apparatus 403 may comprise an electrochemical cell. The electrochemical cell of apparatus 403 may convert an anolyte solution 116 to a non-anolyte solution. The electrochemical cell of apparatus 403 may convert a convert a catholyte solution to a non-catholyte solution. The non-anolyte solution and the non-catholyte solution produced in apparatus 403 may each comprise water that has been treated in by processing unit 115 and apparatus 403. The non-anolyte solution and the non-catholyte solution produced in apparatus 403 may comprise water that is cleaner than water from water supply 117. The non-anolyte solution and the non-catholyte solution produced in apparatus 403 may comprise water that is ion-free and chemical radical-free. Apparatus 403 may comprise activated carbon to remove ions and chemical radicals produced by the processing unit 115. Automation of a sanitization process in accordance a least one aspect of the present disclosure can be done according to the following steps. a. The sanitization process may be started by pre-set timer or by a received input, for example, by receiving a “start signal.”b. A beverage dispensing system 121 may enter into a sanitizing mode wherein valve 102 and valve 111 may be closed, and wherein valve 110 may be opened.c. Valve 114 may be opened to fill processing unit 115 from inlet 208, which in turn may be supplied with water from water supply 117. When processing unit 115 is filled to a desired level, valve 114 may be closed.d. The water in processing unit 115 may be electrochemically activated for a time sufficient to achieve a desired concentration ions and chemical radicals in the water for a given temperature of the solution. In an embodiment, the desired concentration is the maximum concentration of ions and chemical radicals in water for a given temperature of the solution. An anolyte solution 116 produced by processing unit 115 may be accumulated in tank 122. A catholyte solution 124 produced by processing unit 115 may be accumulated in tank 123. Valve 118 may be opened and pumps 120, 103, and 109 may move the treated or activated water through dispensing system 121 when desired to send the anolyte solution 116 through components of dispensing system 121. Valve 125 may be opened and pumps 120, 103, and 109 may move the treated or activated water through dispensing system 121 when desired to send the catholyte solution 124 through components of dispensing system 121.e. Steps a-d may be repeated more than one time to achieve desirable disinfection and cleaning efficacy, i.e. commercial sanitization.f. After step e is completed, if desired, water can be treated in apparatus 403 as previously discussed, and the water treated in apparatus 403 may be sent to a location in the dispensing system 121 to purge any electrochemically-activated water remaining in dispensing system 121. Thus, water can be treated in apparatus 403 and sent from apparatus 403, e.g., through valve 411, which is positioned upstream of pump 103. The water treated in apparatus 403 can thus flow through valve 411 and downstream components, e.g., pump 103, valve 104, mixer 107, valve 108, pump 109, valve 111, and nozzle 112. Alternatively, although not shown in FIG. 3, water treated in apparatus 403 can be sent to valve 106, and then through downstream components, e.g., pump 103, valve 104, mixer 107, valve 108, pump 109, valve 111, and nozzle 112.
