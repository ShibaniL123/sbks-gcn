Step 2: (R)-Methyl 4-(((2-(8-(benzyloxy)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)amino)methyl)benzoate
A stirred mixture of (R)-5-(2-amino-1-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)-8-(benzyloxy)quinolin-2(1H)-one (2.9 g, 6.83 mmol) and methyl 4-formylbenzoate (1.23 g, 7.49 mmol) in DCM (30 mL) was added with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The suspension was filtered through a plug of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the filter cake was washed with further DCM and the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in methanol (30 mL) and the mixture cooled to 0° C. Sodium borohydride (0.517 g, 13.7 mmol) was added portion wise and the reaction mixture stirred at 0° C. for 30 minutes. The coolant was removed and the mixture stirred at room temperature for a further 2 hours. The mixture was quenched with 10% aqueous potassium carbonate and extracted with DCM (×2). The combined DCM extracts were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% DCM to 25:1 DCM/methanol) to afford the title compound (3.26 g, 83%).
