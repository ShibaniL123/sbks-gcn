1-(4- fluorobenzofuran-3- yl)propan- 2-amine
1-(4-fluorobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-one 73b (300 mg, 1.56 mmol), ammonium acetate (1.2 g, 15.6 mmol), and sodium acetate (128 mg, 1.56 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of methanol, then sodium cyanoborohydride (147 mg, 2.34 mmol) was added, and 0.5 mL of acetic acid was added dropwise. After stirring for 12 hours, the reaction was stopped. Water was added, and the reaction solution was extracted with dichloromethane three times. The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by CombiFlash flash preparation instrument with elution system A to obtain the title compound 1-(4-fluorobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-amine 73c (300 mg, yield 66.7%) as a yellow oil.
