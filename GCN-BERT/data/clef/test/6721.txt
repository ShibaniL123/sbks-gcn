(S)-4-[4-cyano-2-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-methyl-2-oxo-1-[3-(trifluormethyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetra-hydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic Acid, Quinine Salt (XXIV)
(rac)-4-[4-cyano-2-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-methyl-2-oxo-1-[3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetra-hydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid (XXII) (563.7 g, 1.176 mol) was prepared at 20° C. in a mixture of isopropanol/water (9:1; 4.2 l) and combined with (−)-quinine (381.4 g; 1.176 mol). After this, it was heated to 50° C. and stirred for 1 h at 50° C. After cooling to 5° C. it was filtered off and the filter cake was washed with a mixture of isopropanol/water (9:1; 1.2 l). Drying was done at 40° C. in vacuum.
Yield: 432 g (46% of theory) of a cream-colored solid.
