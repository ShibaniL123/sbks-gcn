LIGNIN-BASED MULTIPURPOSE FERTILIZERS BACKGROUND [0001] Lignin, which represents 15-35% of wood, is the most abundant renewable organic material on the earth. The pulping industry separates cellulose from the wood composition resulting in lignin and hemicellulose waste by-products known as black liquor and spent pulp liquor. In the sulphite process, the main by-product contained in the spent pulp liquor is lignosulphonate. With each ton of pulping products producing 330-540 Kg of lignosulphonate, the global annual production capacity of lignosulphonate is about 1.8-2.0 million tons. Most of the lignosulphonate (66%) produced in pulping industries is burned as fuel and 34% is treated and disposed. Using this waste stream as a fuel source is inefficient, and releases large amounts of pollutants such as SO2. Simple disposing of lignin, on the other hand, incurs a significant cost to the pulping industry. [0002] Water sources for human and agricultural uses are struggling to meet the growing demand due to the increase in human population. Therefore there is a strong international trend to minimize the requirements of irrigation and water supply to agriculture by developing new types of economical, sustainable, naturally derived controlled release hydrogel fertilizers. Progress in this field will have remarkable impact on the agricultural food production efficiency, as well as environmental and economic benefits.

[0083] Black liquor (1 L) with 50% to 60% solid content and a pH range of 9 to 13 was treated with varying amounts (100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 mL) of a formaldehyde solution (36% to 38% formaldehyde content [wt./vol]) to achieve lignimformaldehyde net ratios of 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, 3.6:1, and 2.5:1. Each reaction was carried out in a five necked flanged top reaction vessel fitted with efficient mechanical stirrer immersed in thermo stated water bath. The effects of reaction pH, temperature, time, and reactant ratio on the concentration of methylols formed were investigated. The concentration of methylol lignin was determined in the reaction mixture by colorimetric techniques using ceric ammonium nitrate and differential scanning calorimetry. Among the tested parameters, a reaction time of 3 hours with a pH of 10, a temperature of 65-70°C, and a lignimformaldehyde net active content ratio of 5:1 gave the highest concentration of ligno methylol derivatives. The obtained lignin methylol derivatives could be used in situ or separated from the solution and stabilized.

Example 2: Purification and stabilization of lignin methylol. [0084] The lignin methylol reaction products from Example 1 in each case were cooled to 0-5°C and neutralized to pH 7 by adding a pre-cooled 10% phosphoric acid (at 5°C). The viscous semi-solid lignin methylol products were separated from the aqueous solution, dissolved in ethanol, dried with molecular sieves, and either used directly after evaporating ethanol under reduced pressure or stabilized by alcohols for storage in a refrigerator for future use. Example 3: Preparation and separation of methylol lignin from solid lignin waste. [0085] Solid lignin (500 grams) from pulping waste was dissolved in 10-20% sodium hydroxide solution, the pH was adjusted to 9-10, with 50% to 60% solid content, and the solution was treated with formaldehyde at lignimformaldehyde net ratios of 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, 3.6:1, and 2.5:1. A reaction time of 3 hours with a pH of 10, a temperature of 60-75°C, and a lignimformaldehyde net active content ratio of 5:1 gave 2.8 methylol groups per lignin structural unit. (Typical values are shown in Tables 1-1 to 1-4). Example 4: Preparation of methylol lignosulphonate derivatives: [0086] Lignosulphonate pulping by product was adjusted to a pH of 10 with 50% to 60% solid content and was treated with varying amounts of a formaldehyde solution to achieve lignimformaldehyde net ratios of20:l, 10:1, 5:1, 3.6:1, and 2.5:1. Example 5: Preparation of sodium lignocarboxylate. [0087] One mole of a methylol lignin solution as prepared in Examples 1 or 2 was treated with citric acid at 30°C using equivalent moles to methylol groups with mixing for two hours. The reaction mixture was then refluxed for one hour, cooled, and neutralized with a 20 % sodium hydroxide solution to obtain sodium lignocarboxylate. Example 6: Preparation of sodium lignocarboxylatesulphonate. [0088] One mole of methylol ligno sulphonate as prepared in Example 4 was treated with citric acid at 30°C using equivalent moles to methylol groups with mixing for two hours. The reaction mixture was then refluxed for one hour, cooled, and neutralised with 20 % sodium hydroxide solution to obtain sodium lignocarboxylatesulphonate dual functionality surfactant. Example 7: Preparation of sodium lignogluconate. [0089] One mole of a methylol lignin solution as prepared in Examples 1, or 2 was treated with sodium gluconate or gluconic acid at 30°C using equivalent moles to methylol groups. When sodium gluconate was used as reactant, 10 % gluconic acid as catalyst and co reactant was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was mixed for two hours, and was then refluxed for one hour, cooled, and neutralized with 20 % sodium hydroxide solution to obtain sodium lignogluconate surfactant. Example 8: Preparation of sodium lignosulphonate gluconate. [0090] One mole of a methylol lignosulphonate solution as prepared in Example 4 was treated with sodium gluconate or gluconic acid at 30°C using equivalent moles to methylol groups. When sodium gluconate was used as reactant, 10 % gluconic acid as catalyst and co reactant was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was mixed for two hours, and was then refluxed for one hour, cooled, and neutralized with 20 % sodium hydroxide solution to obtain sodium lignosulphonate gluconate as lignin-based surfactant. Example 9: Preparation of lignocarboxylate from black liquor and carbon dioxide. [0091] An autoclave reactor was charged with black liquor and solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), and was then secured and heated to 125°C at 100 atm pressure with mixing for five hours. The reaction mixture was cooled and then the degree of carboxylation was determined by FTIR spectroscopy carried out on a purified sample. The quantitative analyses were based on the peak height at 1750 cm'1 related to carboxyl group. The product underwent carboxylation as demonstrated by a 2-5 % increase in the solid content after the carboxylation reactions which was in a good agreement with the FTIR results. Example 10: Reaction of lignomethylol with carbohydrates. [0092] Equimolar amounts of semi-viscous lignomethylol from Example 1 and each of the following carbohydrate sources (dextrose syrup, glucose syrup and sucrose syrup from dates, sorbitol and maltose) were mixed together in the presence of phosphoric acid as catalyst and heated in a 1500W microwave oven for 30 minutes. A homogenous viscous product was obtained, which was partially soluble in water according to the source of lignomethylols and the number of methylol groups per lignin molecule. The soluble part was separated and its surfactant properties were determined including: dynamic and static surface tension, viscosity and cloud point. High molecular weight methylol lignin gave almost insoluble products (95%) and had excellent emulsifying and wetting properties. Example 11: Reaction of lignomethylol and lignosulphonate methylol with amino acids. [0093] Equimolar amounts of lignomethylol and lignosulphonate methylol derivatives from Example 1 were reacted with sodium salts of arginine, leucine, lysine, glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and contrition sulphate using equivalent moles of amino acid sodium salt to methylol groups in the presence of triethylamine as solvent. The reaction mixture was heated on a water bath at 60°C for three hours. The lignoaminoacid salt surfactants obtained were separated, purified, and the general efficiency of the surfactants were determined including: surface tension measurement of water containing different concentrations of each surfactant, viscosity and cloud point. Example 12: Preparation of Gemini surfactants from lignin-based materials and amino acids. [0094] In the presence of triethylamine as solvent, lignomethylol and lignosulphonate methylol derivatives with two or more methylol groups per molecule from Example 1 were reacted with sodium salts of arginine, leucine, lysine, glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and contrition sulphate in equimolar amounts based on moles of amino acid sodium salt to moles of methylol groups. The Gemini lignin-based surfactants obtained were separated, purified, and the general efficiency of the surfactants were determined including: surface tension measurement of water containing different concentrations of each surfactant, viscosity and cloud point. The surfactant efficiency of these surfactants was superior to that of those from Example 11. Example 13: Preparation of Gemini surfactants from lignin-based materials and ethylene diamines. [0095] Lignomethylol and lignosulphonate methylol derivatives with two or more methylol groups per molecule from Example 1 were reacted with a series of ethylene diamines (ethylene diamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine and tetraethylenepentamine) by mixing equimolar amounts of each component based on moles of amino acid sodium salt to moles of methylol groups and heating the mixture at 60-70 C for three hours. The Gemini lignin-based surfactants obtained were separated, purified, and the general efficiency of the surfactants were determined including: surface tension measurement of water containing different concentrations of each surfactant, viscosity and cloud point.

[00106] The present disclosure is not to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described in this application, which are intended as illustrations of various aspects. Many modifications and variations can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Functionally equivalent methods and apparatuses within the scope of the disclosure, in addition to those enumerated herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular methods, reagents, compounds, compositions or biological systems, which can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. [00107] With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity. [00108] It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as “open” terms (e.g., the term “including” should be interpreted as “including but not limited to,” the term “having” should be interpreted as “having at least,” the term “includes” should be interpreted as “includes but is not limited to,” etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an" (e.g., “a” and/or “an” should be interpreted to mean “at least one” or “one or more”); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to “at least one of A, Β, and C, etc.” is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., “ a system having at least one of A, Β, and C” would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, Β alone, C alone, A and Β together, A and C together, Β and C together, and/or A, Β, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or figure, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase “A or B” will be understood to include the possibilities of “A” or “B” or “A and B.” [00109] In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group.
