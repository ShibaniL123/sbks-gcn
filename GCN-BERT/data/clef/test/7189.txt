CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a §371 National State Application of PCT/CN2011/080213 filed Sep. 27, 2011, which claims priority to CN 201110278403.9 filed Sep. 19, 2011. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry, particularly a quinolyl-containing hydroxamic acid compound and the preparation method thereof, and the pharmaceutical composition containing the compound and the use thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Protein kinases are a kind of phosphotransferases, and the role thereof is to transfer the gamma-phosphate group of ATP into a specific amino acid residue of a substrate to phosphorylate a protein, therefore exerting its physiological and biochemical functions. The protein kinases are an important class of kinases. In signal transduction, their main functions lie in two aspects: one is to regulate the activity of the protein by phosphorylation; the other is to amplify progressively the signal by progressive phosphorylation of protein so as to cause cellular reaction. Abnormal protein kinase activity is not only closely related to the abnormity of certain steps in a series of intracellular signal transduction pathways, such as tumor proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis, but also the main reason that leads to a range of other human diseases related to inflammatory or proliferative response, such as rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, asthma, psoriasis. More than four hundred kinds of human diseases have been known to be related directly or indirectly to the protein kinase, which makes the protein kinase become another important class of drug targets after the G-protein-coupled receptors. Protein kinase family consists of more than 500 members, which usually can be divided into two classes, i.e. the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and serine-threonine kinases. In accordance with the location of the kinase in the cells, they can also be divided into receptor kinase and non-receptor kinase which is also known as the intracellular kinase. Receptor kinases generally belong to the tyrosine kinases and are also referred to as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Such a receptor kinase is composed of an extracellular portion, a transmembrane region and an intracellular portion. The portion of kinase having catalytic activity is located in the cytoplasm. The overwhelming majority of serine-threonine kinases are located within the cells and belong to non-receptor kinases, also called cytoplasmic kinases. A typical representative of the RTKs family is growth factor receptors, which may be divided into at least 19 subfamilies. The following are several major subfamilies: (a) HER family receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR (epithelial growth factor receptor), HER2, HER3 and HER4. EGFR is the target of synthetic small molecules drug Tarceva®, Tykerb® and the monoclonal antibody Erbitux® for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. (b) the subfamily consisting of insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR), wherein, IGF-1R is a well-established anti-cancer target, but because it is too similar with IR, especially in the intracellular kinase portion in which the amino acid sequence is 100% identical to the corresponding amino acid sequence of IR, it can inhibit the activity of the IGF-1R while typically inhibiting the activity of IR. There is evidence that IR is also an efficient anti-cancer target. However, it is necessary to find the balance of effectiveness and safety risks with regard to IR inhibitors for anti-cancer because the inhibition of IR leads to the risk of elevated blood sugar. (c) Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) family, including PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, CSF1R, c-KIT and c-fms, wherein the c-Kit is also the molecular target of the drug Gleevec® for treatment of leukemia treatment and is used to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors. (d) Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family, including FLT1 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 or VEGFR1), KDR (or VEGFR-2) and FLT4 (or VEGFR3), the members of which are molecular targets for Sutent® and Naxavar®. (e) Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, including FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4 as well as seven ligands FGF1, FGF2, FGF3, FGF4, FGF5, FGF6, and FGF7, the members of which are still in clinical trials as molecular target drugs. (f) MET family, including c-Met also known as human hepatocyte growth factor receptor (hHGFR) and RON, wherein c-Met plays an important role in the growth and metastasis of initial tumors. The members of the family are still in clinical trials as a molecular target drug. (g) RET family. RET is a receptor of GDNF family members, having RET51, RET43 and RET9 isoforms. It is still in clinical trials as a molecular target drug. (h) Eph family, being the biggest family of receptor tyrosine kinase and consisting of 16 receptors (EPHA1, EphA2, EPHA3, EPHA4, EPHA5, EPHA6, EPHA7, EPHA8, EPHA9, EPHA10, EPHB1, EPHB2, EPHB3, EPHB4, EPHB5, EPHB6) and 9 ligands (EFNA1, EFNA2, EFNA3, EFNA4, EFNA5, EFNB1, EFNB2, EFNB3). These members play an important role in the development of the animal and some members play a role in tumors. AXL is another important receptor tyrosine kinase. AXL is also known as UFO/ARK/Tyro, and the ligand thereof is a vitamin K-dependent growth promoting factor GAS6. AXL is firstly found as transforming gene in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). AXL is overexpressed in metastatic colon cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma Inhibition of AXL activity may play a role in inhibiting tumor growth, proliferation and metastasis. The non-receptor kinase does not have the extracellular portion or the transmembrane region, and the entire kinase is in the cytoplasm. It is currently known that there are at least 24 kinds of non-receptor kinases which are divided into 11 subfamilies, i.e. Src, Frk, Btk, CsK, Abl, Zap70, Fes, Fps, Fak, Jak and ACK subfamily. The Src subfamily is the biggest one, and includes Src, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Blk, Hck, Fgr, AUR1, AUR2 and Yrk kinase. For details, see Neet, K.; Hunter, T. Genes to Cells 1996, 1, 147-169, and the references cited therein. Although several non-receptor kinases are tyrosine kinases, the majority of non-receptor kinases are serine-threonine kinases. Several members therein are the molecular target for the drugs Gleevec® and Sprycel® for treatment of leukemia. As mentioned above, the receptor kinases and non-receptor kinases have been proved as anti-tumor targets in the clinical and practical applications, and several anti-tumor drugs have been approved for marketing for treatment of patients. In addition to treatment of tumors, the abnormal activity of inhibition of receptor kinases and non-receptor kinases can also be used for treating the following diseases, including but not limited to psoriasis or serpedo, cirrhosis, diabetes, diseases involving angiogenesis, diseases involving restenosis, eye diseases, age-related macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammation, immune system diseases such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, kidney disease. Therefore it is necessary to continue to develop inhibitors of these kinases. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is a class of enzymes widely found in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, whose role is to remove acetyl from the amino groups of the core histone N-terminal lysine residues, which causes the core histone N-terminal positively charged to enhance the combination with the negatively charged DNA, and thereby preventing the transcription machinery from contacting with the DNA template. According to their homology to fungal proteins, histone deacetylases (HDAC) are divided into four classes: class I includes HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8, which are homologous to the fungal protein RPD3; class II includes HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 and HDAC9 which are homologous to the fungal protein HDA1; class IIa includes HDAC6 and HDAC 10 containing two catalytic point; class IV includes HDAC11, the catalytic center thereof contains the amino acid residues shared with class I and II HDAC. The catalytic sites of the 11 HDAC isoforms have zinc ions, and may be inhibited by hydroxamic acid compounds such as SAHA (Vorinostat), trichostatin A (TSA). HDAC inhibitors as mood stabilizers and anti-epileptic drugs have a long history in psychiatry and neurology. HDAC inhibitors are investigated for use in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease. Another large class of applications of HDAC inhibitors are used as anticancer drugs, the representative example thereof is Vorinostat developed by Merck, which is approved by FDA for treatment of metastatic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in 2006. The treatment of other tumors including solid tumors and leukemia by HDAC inhibitors is being in clinical trials.

Example 20 Anti-Tumor Experiment In this example, N1′-[3-fluoro-4-[[7-[[1-[2-(hydroxyamino)-2-oxoethyl]-4-piperidyl]methoxy]-6-methoxy-4-quinolyl]oxy]phenyl]-N1-(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide prepared in Example 1 was used to conduct anti-tumor experiment in xenograft nude mice animal models of human gastric cancer. The method and results of the experiment were as follows. Experiment Materials: 4 to 5-week-old SPF level female BALB/c-nu/nu mice with body weight of 12 g to 16 g were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., with the production license number: SCXK (Beijing) 2006. GTL-16 gastric cancer cells were purchased from Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences Cell Resource Center. RPM 1-1640 cell culture media, fetal bovine serum (FBS) and trypsin digestion solution were purchased from Gibco. Various antibiotics were purchased from Sigma. Experiment Method: GTL-16 gastric cancer cells were firstly cultured: GTL-16 cell lines were inoculated in RPM 1-1640 culture medium contain 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin and cultured under the condition of 37° C., 5% CO2 and 100% humidity in a carbon dioxide incubator. The logarithmic growth phase reached upon 24 h, and the cells completely covered the bottom of the culture flask at approximately 48 h after inoculation. Those with 80% of GTL-16 cells covering the bottom of the culture flask were digested and centrifuged at 1000 r/min for 5 min. The cells were diluted to 2×107/ml, and implanted subcutaneously in the right anterior axillary of the nude mice at 0.1 mL per mouse. Starting from 12 days after inoculation of tumor cells, the weight of the tumor-bearing nude mice and the size of tumors were measured, and the mice with tumor sizes ranging from 150-200 mm3 were randomly divided into vehicle control group (Vehicle was 0.25% methanesulfonic acid) and treatment group in which the mice were treated with N1′-[3-fluoro-4-[[7-[[1-[2-(hydroxyamino)-2-oxoethyl]-4-piperidyl]methoxy]-6-methoxy-4-quinolyl]oxy]phenyl]-N1-(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide prepared in Example 1 with 6 mice each group. Thereafter, the nude mice were weighed daily and the oral administrations were performed at 0.1 mL/10 g body-weight through oral gavage method (75 mg/kg, once a day). The tumor size of each animal was measured every 2 days. 14 days later, the tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the tumors were removed and weighed. The calculation method of Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI) was as follows: the experimental data were represented by mean±SD; TGI=[(Vvehicle group−Vtreatment group)÷Vvehicle group]×100%, wherein Vvehicle group represented the mice tumor volume of the vehicle group and Vtreatment group represented the mice tumor volume of the treatment group. Experiment Results: The inhibitory effect of the compound in Example 1 on mice tumor growth in the treatment group: after the animals of the vehicle group and the treatment group were administered with the vehicle and the compound respectively for 14 days, the average tumor volumes of animals in the vehicle group and the treatment group were 1811.2±245.6 mm3 (the number of mice in each group n=6) and 630.9±354.6 mm3 (the number of mice in each group n=6), respectively. Thus, the Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI) of the treatment group was 65%. A picture of tumors showing the inhibitory effect of the compound of the present invention in Example 1 was illustrated in FIG. 2: The treatment group showed a significant tumor growth inhibition as compared to the tumor volume of the vehicle control group.
