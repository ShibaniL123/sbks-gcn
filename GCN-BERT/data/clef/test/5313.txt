Intermediate 27: 2-Isopropyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
To a solution of 1,2-diamino-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 8, 0.5 g, 1.3 mmol) in isobutyric acid (1.9 mL) was added isobutyric anhydride (0.66 mL, 4.0 mmol). The reaction was stirred in a microwave reactor at 150Â° C. for 30 min, and then diluted with EtOAc and H2O. The mixture was then neutralized with 4N NaOH, the aqueous layer extracted twice with EtOAc, and the combined organics washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (192 mg, 63%).
