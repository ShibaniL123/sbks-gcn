GENUS AND SPECIES Verbena sp. VARIETY DENOMINATION ‘KLEVP14463’ BACKGROUND OF THE NEW PLANT The present invention comprises a new and distinct variety of Verbena, botanically known as Verbena sp., and hereinafter referred to by the variety name ‘KLEVP14463’. ‘KLEVP14463’ originated from a cross-pollination conducted in April 2010 in Sydney, Australia between the proprietary female Verbena variety ‘001.1.42’ (unpatented), and the proprietary male Verbena variety derived from the cross of ‘V9120’ (unpatented). The seeds from the cross were sown and plants were grown for evaluation, where an individual plant designated ‘KLEVP14463’ was selected from the group of plants in Cobitty, NSW, Australia in September 2011. In September 2011, ‘KLEVP14463’ was first vegetatively propagated by vegetative cuttings in Cobitty, NSW, Australia. ‘KLEVP 14463’ was found to reproduce true to type in successive generations of asexual propagation via vegetative cuttings in Stuttgart, Germany. CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Plant Breeder's Rights for ‘KLEVP14463’ were applied for in Canada on Feb. 24, 2014, application number 14-8210. ‘KLEVP14463’ has not been made publicly available or sold more than one year prior to the filing date of this application. SUMMARY The following are the most outstanding and distinguishing characteristics of this new variety when grown under normal horticultural practices in Stuttgart, Germany. 1. Large pink and white flowers having good color contrast; 2. Good branching; and 3. An early flowering time. DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH This new Verbena plant is illustrated by the accompanying photograph which shows the plant's overall plant habit including form, foliage, and flowers. The photograph is of a four to five-month-old plant grown in a greenhouse in Stuttgart, Germany in August 2013. The colors shown are as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures. DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW VARIETY The following detailed descriptions set forth the distinctive characteristics of ‘KLEVP14463’. The data which define these characteristics were collected from asexual reproductions carried out in Stuttgart, Germany. Data was collected on three-month-old plants grown in a greenhouse in Stuttgart, Germany in February 2014. Color references are to The R.H.S.
