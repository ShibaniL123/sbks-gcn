Step 7. tert-Butyl 6-cyano-5-(2-fluoro-6-methylphenyl)-3-iodo-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine-1-carboxylate
To a solution of 5-(2-fluoro-6-methylphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine-6-carbonitrile (140.1 mg, 0.555 mmol) in DMF (8.0 ml) was added N-iodosuccinimide (175.2 mg, 0.779 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 80Â° C. for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, Boc-anhydride (168.1 mg, 0.770 mmol) was added followed by DMAP (24.9 mg, 0.204 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and then concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (40 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as a white foamy solid (244.3 mg, 92%).
