Example 10
Acetal 1j:
A 2-dram vial with a PTFE-lined cap was charged with (2-chlorophenyl)methanol (8j, 86.7 mg, 0.606 mmol) and benzoate S1 (227 mg, 0.780 mmol). These were dissolved in DCE (2.00 mL), and TFA (4.5 μL, 0.0608 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was heated to 80° C. and stirred for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, K2CO3 (166 mg, 1.20 mmol) and MeOH (2.00 mL) were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 23° C. for 24 h. The mixture was then filtered through a short pad of silica gel, eluting with EtOAc (50 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (4:1:1 hexanes/EtOAc/CH2Cl2 eluent) to afford acetal 1 j (181 mg, 96% yield, Rf=0.50 in 3:1:1 hexanes/EtOAc/CH2Cl2) as a white solid.
