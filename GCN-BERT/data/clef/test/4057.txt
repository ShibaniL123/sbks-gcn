[0002] This invention was made with government support under Center for HIV/ AIDS Vaccine Immunology-Immunogen Design grant UM1 -All 00645 from the NIH, NIAID, Division of AIDS. The government has certain rights in the invention. TECHNICAL FIELD [0003] The present invention relates in general, to a composition suitable for use in inducing anti-HIV-1 antibodies, and, in particular, to immunogenic compositions comprising envelope proteins and nucleic acids to induce cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies and increase their breadth of coverage. The invention also relates to methods of inducing such broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies using such compositions. BACKGROUND [0004] The development of a safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine is one of the highest priorities of the scientific community working on the HIV-1 epidemic. While anti-retro viral treatment (ART) has dramatically prolonged the lives of HIV-1 infected patients, ART is not routinely available in developing countries. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] In certain embodiments, the invention provides compositions and method for induction of immune response, for example cross-reactive (broadly) neutralizing Ab induction. In certain embodiments, the methods use compositions comprising "swarms" of sequentially evolved envelope viruses that occur in the setting of bnAb generation in vivo in HIV-1 infection.

In certain embodiments, these compositions are used in immunization methods as a prime and/or boost as described in Selections as described herein. [0007] In one aspect the invention provides selections of envelopes from individual CH505, which selections can be used in compositions for immunizations to induce lineages of broad neutralizing antibodies. In certain embodiments, there is some variance in the immunization regimen; in some embodiments, the selection of HIV-1 envelopes may be grouped in various combinations of primes and boosts, either as nucleic acids, proteins, or combinations thereof.

In some embodiments, grouping of the envelopes is based on chronological evolution of envelope viruses that occurs in the setting of bnAb generation in vivo in HIV-1 infection.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0031] Figure 1 shows CH505 Env polymorphisms, neutralization, vaccine regimes, and phylogeny. [0032] Figure 2 shows swarm vaccine variant frequencies in concatenated Env "hot-spot" sites, numbered as in Table 1. These sites were used to identify immunogens because they include polymorphisms resulting from immune selection by neutralizing antibodies. Three criteria identified Env sites of outstanding interest ("hot spots") for antibody evolution: (a) "selected" sites with T/F frequency below 20% in any time -point sampled, (b) single or PNG sites with q<0.1 for tree-corrected signatures of neutralization activity, and (c) CD4 binding-site and known CHI 03 contacts with any variation. We extracted these sites from aligned sequences and concatenated them to see how each candidate clone varies in Env "hot spots" (Table 1). Rather than eliminate sites found by multiple methods, duplicate sites are included multiple times, for emphasis. [0033] Figure 3 shows one embodiment of alignment columns in Env "hot-spot" summaries, concatenated to comprise concatamers. [0034] Figure 4 shows another embodiment of alignment columns in Env "hot-spot" concatamer summaries. [0035] Figure 5 shows one embodiment of selected Envs as concatenated sites. [0036] Figure 6 shows another embodiment of selected Envs as concatenated sites. [0037] Figure 7 shows one embodiment of a proposed swarm of CH505 envelopes. [0038] Figure 8 shows another embodiment of a proposed swarm of CH505 envelopes. [0039] Figure 9 shows temporal development of CH505 variant frequencies for 36 Env sites from time of infection (Y0) through three years of follow-up (Y3), resulting from development of neutralizing antibody responses with increasing heterologous neutralization breadth. An O indicates a potentially N- (asparagine) linked glycosylation site. For clarity, only variants that exceed 20% frequency in any given sample are shown. [0040] Figure 10 shows temporal progression of CH505 variant frequencies for 40 Env sites from time of infection with the Transmitted/Founder virus (wOOO) through three years of follow- up (wl60). Height of each character indicates its frequency per sample. In all except the top row, the Transmitted/Founder virus is not shown and constitutes the remaining portion of the sample. Insertions or deletions (indels) appear as grey blocks. Multiple sites with the same HXB2 numbering correspond to un-numbered insertions towards the C-terminal end of the position numbered. [0041] Figure 11 shows hierarchical clustering of CH505 variant frequencies per longitudinal sample (x-axis) for 26 selected CH505 Env mutations. Frequency of non-Transmitted/Founder mutations is proportional to the grey-scale value in each cell, and cells clustered together on the vertical axis indicate Env sites that vary in a concerted manner (i.e. in the same temporal window), rather than independently. Where a numbered site appears more than once (e.g., 359/ V281G and 359/ V281S), it depicts alternative non-Transmitted/Founder variant forms. Sites with indels and variant forms that fail to exceed 25% frequency of any given sample were excluded for clarity. [0042] Figure 12 shows hierarchical clustering of Shannon entropies per longitudinal sample (x- axis) for 40 selected CH505 Env sites. Low entropy means high prevalence of a single variant, whether Transmitted/Founder or an escape mutation, and high entropy indicates high variability. This uses the same information as Figures 9-11 but shows when and where variation is most active, clustering together on the vertical axis sites that share variability (entropy) profiles. [0043] Figure 13 is an enlarged version of Figure 1. Figure 1 shows the genotype variation (A, left panel), neutralization titers (B, center panel), and Envelope phylogenetic relations (C, right panel) among CH505 Envelope variants. The vertical position in each panel corresponds to the same CH505 Env clone named on the right side of the tree. Distance from the Transmitted/Founder form generally increases from top towards bottom of the figure. In the left panel (A), sites not colored correspond to the Transmitted/Founder virus, red sites show mutations, and black sites correspond to insertions or deletions relative to the Transmitted/Founder virus. Additional annotation indicates the known CD4 binding-site contacts (short, vertical black bars towards top), CHI 03 binding-site contacts for the resolved structure (short, vertical blue bars with a horizontal line to indicate the region resolved by X-Ray Crystallography), gpl20 landmarks (vertical grey rectangular regions, VI -V5 hypervariable loops, Loop D, and CD4 Loops), a dashed vertical line delineating the gpl20/gp41 boundary, and results from testing for CTL epitopes with ELISpot assays (magenta bands at top and bottom show where peptides were tested and negative, and a magenta rectangle for the tested positive region outside the C-terminal end of V4). The center panel (B) depicts IC50 (50% inhibitory concentrations, in μg/ml) values from autologous neutralization assays against 13 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of the CH103 lineage and each of 134 CH505 Env-pseudotyped viruses. Color-scale values indicate neutralization potency and range from grey (no neutralization detected) through dark red (potent neutralization, i.e. <0.2 μg/ml; empty cells correspond to absence of information). The cumulative progression of neutralization potency from left to right, corresponding to developmental stages in the CHI 03 lineage, indicates accumulation of neutralization potency. Similarly, increased presence neutralization signal from top to bottom corresponds to increasing neutralization breadth per MAb in the CHI 03 lineage. In the rightmost panel (C) is the phylogeny of CH505 Envs, with the x-axis indicating distance from the Transmitted-Founder virus per the scale bar (units are mutations per site). The tree is ordered vertically such that lineages with the most descendants appear towards the bottom. Each leaf on the tree corresponds to a CH505 autologous Env, with the name of the sequence depicted ('w' and symbol color indicate the sample time-point; 'M' indicates a synthetic mutant Env). The color of text in each leaf name indicates its inclusion in a possible embodiment, or grey for exclusion from any embodiments described herein. Three long, vertical lines to the left of the tree depict the phylogenetic distribution of envelopes in three distinct alternative embodiments (identified as "Vaccination Regimes 1-3"), with diamonds used to identify each.

[0055] Figure 25 shows an assay for identification of CD4 Binding Site broad neutralizing lineage antibodies. VRCOl and CHI 03 CD4Binding Site BnAbs do not bind RSCdelta371(D371). For plasma, a greater than 2.5 fold loss of binding when the titer is over 200 suggests the presence of CD4bs BnAb (Lynch, JVI, 2012). [0056] Figure 26 shows FACS analysis identifying CH505 TF gpl20 Reactive Memory B Cells that Demonstrate RSC3 Binding Reactivity (Gr. 1, animal 5346 in NHP study #79). FACS analysis is carried out essentially as described in Example 1. Fig. 26A shows CH505 TF gpl20 DP = 109; RSC3-positive (black DP) = 10 (9%). Fig. 26B shows CH505 TF gpl20 DP = 110; RSC3-positive (black DP) = 8 (7%). [0057] Figure 27 shows RSC3+, RSC3D371- Memory B Cells in CH505 T/F Env-Immunized #79 NHPs. FACS analysis is carried out essentially as described in Example 1. [0058] Figure 28 shows induction of autologous neutralization of both the transmitted/founder CH505 Env and neutralization sensitive CH505 Env variant w004.3 in NHPs. Shown is week 14 neutralization data from TZMbl assay after three immunizations. [0059] Figure 29 is a heatmap showing neutralization potency of antibodies in the CHI 03 lineage against early CH505 mutations, evaluated by Feng Gao. Mi l shows enhanced sensitivity relative to the TF, so might serve as a good trigger of the CH103 like lineage. [0060] Figure 30 shows a heatmap showing neutralization potency of antibodies in the CHI 03 lineage against population signature mutations. M14 confers partial resistance on its own, while the others need to be given in combination to confer resistance. In certain embodiments, adding M14 and M24 after affinity maturation is initiated may expand breadth. [0061] Figure 31 shows sequences of trivalent envelope mosaics. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0062] The development of a safe, highly efficacious prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine is of paramount importance for the control and prevention of HIV-1 infection. A major goal of HIV-1 vaccine development is the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) (Immunol. Rev. 254: 225-244, 2013). BnAbs are protective in rhesus macaques against SHIV challenge, but as yet, are not induced by current vaccines. [0063] For the past 25 years, the HIV vaccine development field has used single or prime boost heterologous Envs as immunogens, but to date has not found a regimen to induce high levels of bnAbs. [0064] Recently, a new paradigm for design of strategies for induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies was introduced, that of B cell lineage immunogen design (Nature Biotech. 30: 423, 2012) in which the induction of bnAb lineages is recreated. It was recently demonstrated the power of mapping the co-evolution of bnAbs and founder virus for elucidating the Env evolution pathways that lead to bnAb induction (Nature 496: 469, 2013). From this type of work has come the hypothesis that bnAb induction will require a selection of antigens to recreate the "swarms" of sequentially evolved viruses that occur in the setting of bnAb generation in vivo in HIV infection (Nature 496: 469, 2013). [0065] A critical question is why the CH505 immunogens are better than other immunogens. This rationale comes from three recent observations. First, a series of immunizations of single putatively "optimized" or "native" trimers when used as an immunogen have not induced bnAbs as single immunogens. Second, in all the chronically infected individuals who do develop bnAbs, they develop them in plasma after ~2 years. When these individuals have been studied at the time soon after transmission, they do not make bnAbs immediately. Third, now that individual's virus and bnAb co-evolution has been mapped from the time of transmission to the development of bnAbs, the identification of the specific Envs that lead to bnAb development have been identified-thus taking the guess work out of env choice. [0066] Two other considerations are important. The first is that for the CHI 03 bnAb CD4 binding site lineage, the VH4-59 and V 3-1 genes are common as are the VDJ, VJ recombinations of the lineage (Liao, Nature 496: 469, 2013). In addition, the bnAb sites are so unusual, we are finding that the same VH and VL usage is recurring in multiple individuals. Thus, we can expect the CH505 Envs to induce CD4 binding site antibodies in many different individuals. [0067] Finally, regarding the choice of gpl20 vs. gpl60, for the genetic immunization we would normally not even consider not using gpl60. However, in acute infection, gp41 non-neutralizing antibodies are dominant and overwhelm gpl20 responses (Tomaras, G et al. J. Virol. 82: 12449, 2008; Liao, HX et al. JEM 208: 2237, 2011). Recently we have found that the HVTN 505 DNA prime, rAd5 vaccine trial that utilized gpl40 as an immunogen, also had the dominant response of non-neutralizing gp41 antibodies. Thus, we will evaluate early on the use of gpl60 vs gpl20 for gp41 dominance. [0068] In certain aspects the invention provides a strategy for induction of bnAbs is to select and develop immunogens designed to recreate the antigenic evolution of Envs that occur when bnAbs do develop in the context of infection. Therefore, we believe that the groups of CH505 Envs proposed in this study is the "best in class" of current Env immunogens. [0069] That broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) occur in nearly all sera from chronically infected HIV-1 subjects suggests anyone can develop some bnAb response if exposed to immunogens via vaccination. Working back from mature bnAbs through intermediates enabled understanding their development from the unmutated ancestor, and showed that antigenic diversity preceded the development of population breadth. See Liao et al. (2013) Nature 496, 469-476. In this study, an individual "CH505" was followed from HIV-1 transmission to development of broadly neutralizing antibodies. This individual developed antibodies targeted to CD4 binding site on gpl20. In this individual the virus was sequenced over time, and broadly neutralizing antibody clonal lineage ("CH103") was isolated by antigen-specific B cell sorts, memory B cell culture, and amplified by VH/VL next generation pyrosequencing. The CHI 03 lineage began by binding the T/F virus, autologous neutralization evolved through somatic mutation and affinity maturation, escape from neutralization drove rapid (clearly by 20 weeks) accumulation of variation in the epitope, antibody breadth followed this viral diversification (Figure 22-23). [0070] Further analysis of envelopes and antibodies from the CH505 individual indicated that a non-CH103 Lineage participates in driving CH103-BnAb induction. For example VI loop, V5 loop and CD4 binding site loop mutations escape from CHI 03 and are driven by CHI 03 lineage. Loop D mutations enhanced neutralization by CHI 03 lineage and are driven by another lineage. Transmitted/founder Env, or another early envelope for example W004.26, triggers naive B cell with CHI 03 Unmutated Common Ancestor (UCA) which develop in to intermediate antibodies. Transmitted/founder Env, or another early envelope for example W004.26, also triggers non- CHI 03 autologous neutralizing Abs that drive loop D mutations in Env that have enhanced binding to intermediate and mature CHI 03 antibodies and drive remainder of the lineage. In certain embodiments, the inventive composition and methods also comprise loop D mutant envelopes (e.g. but not limited to M10, Mi l, M19, M20, M21, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9) as immunogens. In certain embodiments, the D-loop mutants are included in a composition used as a prime. [0071] The invention provides various methods to choose a subset of viral variants, including but not limited to envelopes, to investigate the role of antigenic diversity in serial samples. In other aspects, the invention provides compositions comprising viral variants, for example but not limited to envelopes, selected based on various criteria as described herein to be used as immunogens. In some embodiments, the immunogens are selected based on the envelope binding to the UCA, and/or intermediate antibodies. In other embodiments the immunogens are selected based on their chronological appearance during infection. [0072] In other aspects, the invention provides immunization strategies using the selections of immunogens to induce cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. In certain aspects, the immunization strategies as described herein are referred to as "swarm" immunizations to reflect that multiple envelopes are used to induce immune responses. The multiple envelopes in a swarm could be combined in various immunization protocols of priming and boosting. [0073] In certain embodiments the invention provides that sites losing the ancestral, transmitted- founder (T/F) state are most likely under positive selection. From acute, homogenous infections with 3-5 years of follow-up, identified herein are sites of interest among plasma single genome analysis (SGA) Envs by comparing the proportion of sequences per time -point in the T/F state with a threshold, typically 5%. Sites with T/F frequencies below threshold are putative escapes. We then selected clones with representative escape mutations. Where more information was available, such as tree-corrected neutralization signatures and antibody contacts from co-crystal structure, additional sites of interest were considered. [0074] Co-evolution of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody (CHI 03) and founder virus was previously reported in African donor (CH505). See Liao et al. (2013) Nature 496, 469-476. In CH505, which had an early antibody that bound autologous T/F virus, we studied 398 envs from 14 time-points over three years (median per sample: 25, range: 18-53). We found 36 sites with T/F frequencies under 20% in any sample. Neutralization and structure data identified 28 and 22 interesting sites, respectively. Together, six gp41 and 53 gpl20 sites were identified, plus six VI or V5 insertions not in HXB2. [0075] The invention provides an approach to select reagents for neutralization assays and subsequently investigate affinity maturation, autologous neutralization, and the transition to heterologous neutralization and breadth. Given the sustained coevolution of immunity and escape this antigen selection based on antibody and antigen coevolution has specific implications for selection of immunogens for vaccine design. [0076] In one embodiment, 100 clones were selected that represent the selected sites. In another embodiment, 101 clones were selected that represent the selected sites. In another embodiment, 103 clones were selected that represent the selected sites. In another embodiment, 104 clones were selected that represent the selected sites, one embodiment, 10 clones were selected that represent the selected sites. In one embodiment, 12 clones were selected that represent the selected sites. In one embodiment, 4 clones were selected that represent the selected sites. These sets of clones represent antigenic diversity by deliberate inclusion of polymorphisms that result from immune selection by neutralizing antibodies, and had a lower clustering coefficient and greater diversity in selected sites than sets sampled randomly. These selections of clones represent various levels of antigenic diversity in the HIV-1 envelope and are based on the genetic diversity of longitudinally sampled SGA envelopes, and correlated with other factors such as antigenic/neutralization diversity, and antibody coevolution. [0077] Sequences/Clones [0078] Described herein are nucleic and amino acids sequences of HIV-1 envelopes. In certain embodiments, the described HIV-1 envelope sequences are gpl60s. In certain embodiments, the described HIV-1 envelope sequences are gpl20s. Other sequences, for example but not limited to gpl45s, gpl40s, both cleaved and uncleaved, gpl50s, gp41s, which are readily derived from the nucleic acid and amino acid gpl60 sequences. In certain embodiments the nucleic acid sequences are codon optimized for optimal expression in a host cell, for example a mammalian cell, a rBCG cell or any other suitable expression system. [0079] In certain embodiments, the envelope design in accordance with the present invention involves deletion of residues (e.g., 5-11, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 amino acids) at the N-terminus. For delta N-terminal design, amino acid residues ranging from 4 residues or even fewer to 14 residues or even more are deleted. These residues are between the maturation (signal peptide, usually ending with CX, X can be any amino acid) and "VPVXXXX...". In case of CH505 T/F Env as an example, 8 amino acids (italicized and underlined in the below sequence) were deleted: MRVMGIQRNYPQWWIWSMLGFWMLMICNG _EI_2Zn_2VPVWKEAKTTLFCASDAKA YEKEVHNVWATHAC VPTDPNPQE ...(rest of envelope sequence is indicated as "..."). In other embodiments, the delta N-design described for CH505 T/F envelope can be used to make delta N-designs of other CH505 envelopes. In certain embodiments, the invention relates generally to an immunogen, gpl60, gpl20 or gpl40, without an N-terminal Herpes Simplex gD tag substituted for amino acids of the N-terminus of gpl20, with an HIV leader sequence (or other leader sequence), and without the original about 4 to about 25, for example 11, amino acids of the N-terminus of the envelope (e.g. gpl20). See WO2013/006688, e.g. at pages 10-12, the contents of which publication is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. [0080] The general strategy of deletion of N-terminal amino acids of envelopes results in proteins, for example gpl20s, expressed in mammalian cells that are primarily monomeric, as opposed to dimeric, and, therefore, solves the production and scalability problem of commercial g l20 Env vaccine production. In other embodiments, the amino acid deletions at the N- terminus result in increased immunogenicity of the envelopes. [0081] In certain embodiments, the invention provides envelope sequences, amino acid sequences and the corresponding nucleic acids, and in which the V3 loop is substituted with the following V3 loop sequence TRP NNTRKSIRIGPGQTFY ATGDIIGNIRQAH. This substitution of the V3 loop reduced product cleavage and improves protein yield during recombinant protein production in CHO cells. [0082] In certain embodiments, the CH505 envelopes will have added certain amino acids to enhance binding of various broad neutralizing antibodies. Such modifications could include but not limited to, mutations at W680G or modification of glycan sites for enhanced neutralization. [0083] In certain aspects, the invention provides composition and methods which use a selection of sequential CH505 Envs, as gpl20s, gp 140s cleaved and uncleaved, gpl45s, gpl50s and gpl60s, as proteins, DNAs, RNAs, or any combination thereof, administered as primes and boosts to elicit immune response. Sequential CH505 Envs as proteins would be co-administered with nucleic acid vectors containing Envs to amplify antibody induction. In a non-limiting embodiment the CH505 Envs include transmitted/founder, week 53, week 58, week 100 envelopes. In certain embodiments, the compositions and methods include any immunogenic HIV-1 sequences to give the best coverage for T cell help and cytotoxic T cell induction. In certain embodiments, the compositions and methods include mosaic and/or consensus HIV-1 genes to give the best coverage for T cell help and cytotoxic T cell induction. In certain embodiments, the compositions and methods include mosaic group M and/or consensus genes to give the best coverage for T cell help and cytotoxic T cell induction. In some embodiments, the mosaic genes are any suitable gene from the HIV-1 genome. In some embodiments, the mosaic genes are Env genes, Gag genes, Pol genes, Nef genes, or any combination thereof. See e.g. US Patent No. 7951377. In some embodiments the mosaic genes are bivalent mosaics. In some embodiments the mosaic genes are trivalent. In some embodiments, the mosaic genes are administered in a suitable vector with each immunization with Env gene inserts in a suitable vector and/or as a protein. In some embodiments, the mosaic genes, for example as bivalent mosaic Gag group M consensus genes, are administered in a suitable vector, for example but not limited to HSV2, would be administered with each immunization with Env gene inserts in a suitable vector, for example but not limited to HSV-2. [0084] In certain aspects the invention provides compositions and methods of Env genetic immunization either alone or with Env proteins to recreate the swarms of evolved viruses that have led to bnAb induction. Nucleotide-based vaccines offer a flexible vector format to immunize against virtually any protein antigen. Currently, two types of genetic vaccination are available for testing— DNAs and mRNAs. [0085] In certain aspects the invention contemplates using immunogenic compositions wherein immunogens are delivered as DNA. See Graham BS, Enama ME, Nason MC, Gordon IJ, Peel SA, et al. (2013) DNA Vaccine Delivered by a Needle-Free Injection Device Improves Potency of Priming for Antibody and CD8+ T-Cell Responses after rAd5 Boost in a Randomized Clinical Trial. PLoS ONE 8(4): e59340, page 9. Various technologies for delivery of nucleic acids, as DNA and/or RNA, so as to elicit immune response, both T-cell and humoral responses, are known in the art and are under developments. In certain embodiments, DNA can be delivered as naked DNA. In certain embodiments, DNA is formulated for delivery by a gene gun. In certain embodiments, DNA is administered by electroporation, or by a needle-free injection technologies, for example but not limited to Biojector® device. In certain embodiments, the DNA is inserted in vectors. The DNA is delivered using a suitable vector for expression in mammalian cells. In certain embodiments the nucleic acids encoding the envelopes are optimized for expression. In certain embodiments DNA is optimized, e.g. codon optimized, for expression. In certain embodiments the nucleic acids are optimized for expression in vectors and/or in mammalian cells. In non-limiting embodiments these are bacterially derived vectors, adenovirus based vectors, rAdenovirus (e.g. Barouch DH, et al. Nature Med. 16: 319-23, 2010), recombinant mycobacteria (e.g. rBCG or M smegmatis) (Yu, JS et al. Clinical Vaccine Immunol. 14: 886-093,2007; ibid 13: 1204-11,2006), and recombinant vaccinia type of vectors (Santra S. Nature Med. 16: 324-8, 2010), for example but not limited to ALVAC, replicating (Kibler KV et al., PLoS One 6: e25674, 2011 nov 9.) and non-replicating (Perreau M et al. J. virology 85: 9854-62, 2011) NYVAC, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)), adeno-associated virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) replicons, Herpes Simplex Virus vectors, and other suitable vectors. [0086] In certain aspects the invention contemplates using immunogenic compositions wherein immunogens are delivered as DNA or RNA in suitable formulations. Various technologies which contemplate using DNA or RNA, or may use complexes of nucleic acid molecules and other entities to be used in immunization. In certain embodiments, DNA or RNA is administered as nanoparticles consisting of low dose antigen-encoding DNA formulated with a block copolymer (amphiphilic block copolymer 704). See Cany et al., Journal of Hepatology 2011 vol. 54 j 115-121; Arnaoty et al., Chapter 17 in Yves Bigot (ed.), Mobile Genetic Elements: Protocols and Genomic Applications, Methods in Molecular Biology, vol. 859, pp293-305 (2012); Arnaoty et al. (2013) Mol Genet Genomics. 2013 Aug;288(7-8):347-63. Nanocarrier technologies called Nanotaxi® for immunogenic macromolecules (DNA, RNA, Protein) delivery are under development. See for example technologies developed by incellart. [0087] In certain aspects the invention contemplates using immunogenic compositions wherein immunogens are delivered as recombinant proteins. Various methods for production and purification of recombinant proteins suitable for use in immunization are known in the art. [0088] The immunogenic envelopes can also be administered as a protein boost in combination with a variety of nucleic acid envelope primes (e.g., HIV -1 Envs delivered as DNA expressed in viral or bacterial vectors). [0089] Dosing of proteins and nucleic acids can be readily determined by a skilled artisan. A single dose of nucleic acid can range from a few nanograms (ng) to a few micrograms ^g) or milligram of a single immunogenic nucleic acid. Recombinant protein dose can range from a few μg micrograms to a few hundred micrograms, or milligrams of a single immunogenic polypeptide. [0090] Administration: The compositions can be formulated with appropriate carriers using known techniques to yield compositions suitable for various routes of administration. In certain embodiments the compositions are delivered via intramascular (IM), via subcutaneous, via intravenous, via nasal, via mucosal routes, or any other suitable route of immunization. [0091] The compositions can be formulated with appropriate carriers and adjuvants using techniques to yield compositions suitable for immunization. The compositions can include an adjuvant, such as, for example but not limited to, alum, poly IC, MF-59 or other squalene-based adjuvant, ASOIB, or other liposomal based adjuvant suitable for protein or nucleic acid immunization. In certain embodiments, TLR agonists are used as adjuvants. In other embodiment, adjuvants which break immune tolerance are included in the immunogenic compositions. [0092] In certain embodiments, the methods and compositions comprise any suitable agent or immune modulation which could modulate mechanisms of host immune tolerance and release of the induced antibodies. In non- limiting embodiments modulation includes PD-1 blockade; T regulatory cell depletion; CD40L hyperstimulation; soluble antigen administration, wherein the soluble antigen is designed such that the soluble agent eliminates B cells targeting dominant epitopes, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, an immunomodulatory agent is administered in at time and in an amount sufficient for transient modulation of the subject's immune response so as to induce an immune response which comprises broad neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 envelope. Non-limiting examples of such agents is any one of the agents described herein: e.g. chloroquine (CQ), PTP1B Inhibitor - CAS 765317-72-4 - Calbiochem or MSI 1436 clodronate or any other bisphosphonate; a Foxol inhibitor, e.g. 344355 I Foxol Inhibitor, AS 1842856 - Calbiochem; Gleevac, anti-CD25 antibody, anti-CCR4 Ab, an agent which binds to a B cell receptor for a dominant HIV-1 envelope epitope, or any combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the methods comprise administering a second immunomodulatory agent, wherein the second and first immunomodulatory agents are different. [0093] There are various host mechanisms that control bNAbs. For example highly somatically mutated antibodies become autoreactive and/or less fit (Immunity 8: 751, 1998; PloS Comp. Biol. 6 el000800 , 2010; J. Thoret. Biol. 164:37, 1993); Polyreactive/autoreactive naive B cell receptors (unmutated common ancestors of clonal lineages) can lead to deletion of Ab precursors (Nature 373: 252, 1995; PNAS 107: 181, 2010; J. Immunol. 187: 3785, 2011); Abs with long HCDR3 can be limited by tolerance deletion (JI 162: 6060, 1999; JCI 108: 879, 2001). BnAb knock-in mouse models are providing insights into the various mechanisms of tolerance control of MPER BnAb induction (deletion, anergy, receptor editing). Other variations of tolerance control likely will be operative in limiting BnAbs with long HCDR3s, high levels of somatic hypermutations. 2F5 and 4E10 BnAbs were induced in mature antibody knock-in mouse models with MPER peptide-liposome -TLR immunogens. Next step is immunization of germline mouse models and humans with the same immunogens. [0094] The invention is described in the following non-limiting examples. Table 13.

EXAMPLES Example 1 [0095] HIV-1 sequences, including envelopes, and antibodies from HIV-1 infected individual CH505 were isolated as described in Liao et al. (2013) Nature 496, 469-476 including supplementary materials. [0096] Recombinant HIV-1 proteins [0097] HIV-1 Env genes for subtype B, 63521, subtype C, 1086, and subtype CRF 01, 427299, as well as subtype C, CH505 autologous transmitted/founder Env were obtained from acutely infected HIV-1 subjects by single genome amplification, codon-optimized by using the codon usage of highly expressed human housekeeping genes, de novo synthesized (GeneScript) as gpl40 or gpl20 (AE.427299) and cloned into a mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/hygromycin (Invitrogen). Recombinant Env glycoproteins were produced in 293F cells cultured in serum-free medium and transfected with the HIV-1 gpl40- or gpl20-expressing pcDNA3.1 plasmids, purified from the supematants of transfected 293F cells by using Galanthus nivalis lectin-agarose (Vector Labs) column chromatography, and stored at -80 °C. Select Env proteins made as CH505 transmitted/founder Env were further purified by superose 6 column chromatography to trimeric forms, and used in binding assays that showed similar results as with the lectin-purified oligomers. [0098] ELISA [0099] Binding of patient plasma antibodies and CHI 03 clonal lineage antibodies to autologous and heterologous HIV-1 Env proteins was measured by ELISA as described previously. Plasma samples in serial threefold dilutions starting at 1 :30 to 1 :521,4470 or purified monoclonal antibodies in serial threefold dilutions starting at 100 μg ml-1 to 0.000 μg ml-1 diluted in PBS were assayed for binding to autologous and heterologous HIV-1 Env proteins. Binding of biotin- labelled CHI 03 at the subsaturating concentration was assayed for cross-competition by unlabelled HIV-1 antibodies and soluble CD4-Ig in serial fourfold dilutions starting at 10 μg ml-l . The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of plasma samples and monoclonal antibodies to HIV-1 Env proteins were determined and expressed as either the reciprocal dilution of the plasma samples or concentration of monoclonal antibodies. [0100] Surface plasmon resonance affinity and kinetics measurements [0101] Binding Kd and rate constant (association rate (Ka)) measurements of monoclonal antibodies and all candidate UCAs to the autologous Env C. CH05 gpl40 and/or the heterologous Env B.63521 gpl20 were carried out on BIAcore 3000 instruments as described previously. Anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Sigma Chemicals) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip to about 15,000 response units and each antibody was captured to about 50-200 response units on three individual flow cells for replicate analysis, in addition to having one flow cell captured with the control Synagis (anti-RSV) monoclonal antibody on the same sensor chip. Double referencing for each monoclonal antibody-HIV-1 Env binding interactions was used to subtract nonspecific binding and signal drift of the Env proteins to the control surface and blank buffer flow, respectively. Antibody capture level on the sensor surface was optimized for each monoclonal antibody to minimize rebinding and any associated avidity effects. C.CH505 Env gpl40 protein was injected at concentrations ranging from 2 to 25 μg ml-1, and B.63521 gpl20 was injected at 50-400 μg ml-1 for UCAs and early intermediates IA8 and IA4, 10-100 μg ml-1 for intermediate I A3, and 1-25 μg ml-1 for the distal and mature monoclonal antibodies. All curve-fitting analyses were performed using global fit of to the 1 : 1 Langmuir model and are representative of at least three measurements. All data analysis was performed using the BIAevaluation 4.1 analysis software (GE Healthcare). [0102] Neutralization assays [0103] Neutralizing antibody assays in TZM-bl cells were performed as described previously. Neutralizing activity of plasma samples in eight serial threefold dilutions starting at 1 :20 dilution and for recombinant monoclonal antibodies in eight serial threefold dilutions starting at 50 μg ml-1 were tested against autologous and herologous HIV-1 Env-pseudotyped viruses in TZM-bl-based neutralization assays using the methods known in the art. Neutralization breadth of CHI 03 was determined using a panel of 196 of geographically and genetically diverse Env- pseudoviruses representing the major circulated genetic subtypes and circulating recombinant forms. HIV-1 subtype robustness is derived from the analysis of HIV-1 clades over time. The data were calculated as a reduction in luminescence units compared with control wells, and reported as IC50 in either reciprocal dilution for plasma samples or in micrograms per micro litre for monoclonal antibodies.

Example 2 [0105] Combinations of antigens derived from CH505 envelope sequences for swarm immunizations [0106] Provided herein are non- limiting examples of combinations of antigens derived from CH505 envelope sequences for a swarm immunization. The selection includes priming with a virus which binds to the UCA, for example a T/F virus or another early (e.g. but not limited to week 004.3, or 004.26) virus envelope. In certain embodiments the prime could include D-loop variants. In certain embodiments the boost could include D-loop variants. In certain embodiments, these D-loop variants are envelope escape mutants not recognized by the UCA. Non- limiting examples of such D-loop variants are envelopes designated as Ml 0, Ml 1, Ml 9, M20, M21, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, M14 (TF_M14), M24 (TF_24), M15, M16, M17, M18, M22, M23, M24, M25, M26. [0107] Non- limiting embodiments of envelopes selected for swarm vaccination are shown as the selections described below. A skilled artisan would appreciate that a vaccination protocol can include a sequential immunization starting with the "prime" envelope(s) and followed by sequential boosts, which include individual envelopes or combination of envelopes. In another vaccination protocol, the sequential immunization starts with the "prime" envelope(s) and is followed with boosts of cumulative prime and/or boost envelopes (for e.g. Table 5). In certain embodiments, the prime does not include T/F sequence (WOOO.TF). In certain embodiments, the prime includes w004.03 envelope. In certain embodiments, the prime includes w004.26 envelope. In certain embodiments, the immunization methods do not include immunization with HIV-1 envelope T/F. In other embodiments for example the T/F envelope may not be included when w004.03 or w004.26 envelope is included. In certain embodiments, the immunization methods do not include a schedule of four valent immunization with HIV-1 envelopes T/F, w053.16, w078.33, and wl00.B6. [0108] In certain embodiments, there is some variance in the immunization regimen; in some embodiments, the selection of HIV-1 envelopes may be grouped in various combinations of primes and boosts, either as nucleic acids, proteins, or combinations thereof. [0109] In certain embodiments the immunization includes a prime administered as DNA, and MVA boosts.

[0122] The selections of CH505-Envs were down-selected from a series of 400 CH505 Envs isolated by single-genome amplification followed for 3 years after acute infection, based on experimental data. The enhanced neutralization breadth that developed in the CD4-binding site (bs) CHI 03 antibody lineage that arose in subject CH505 developed in conjunction with epitope diversification in the CH505's viral quasispecies. It was observed that at 6 months post-infection in there was more diversification in the CD4bs epitope region in this donor than sixteen other acutely infected donors. Population breadth did not arise in the CHI 03 antibody lineage until the epitope began to diversify. A hypothesis is that the CHI 03 linage drove viral escape, but then the antibody adapted to the relatively resistant viral variants. As this series of events was repeated, the emerging antibodies evolved to tolerate greater levels of diversity in relevant sites, and began to be able to recognize and neutralize diverse heterologous forms for the virus and manifest population breadth. In certain embodiments, eight envs are selected from CH505 sequences to reflect diverse variants for making Env pseudoviruses, with the goal of recapitulating CH505 HIV-1 antigenic diversity over time, making sure selected site (i.e. those sites reflecting major antigenic shifts) diversity was represented. [0123] Specifically, for CH505 the virus and envelope evolution were mapped, and the CHI 03 CD4 binding-site bnAb evolution. In addition, 135 CH505 varied envelope pseudotyped viruses were made and tested them for neutralization sensitivity by members of the CHI 03 bnAb lineage (e.g, Figures 13, 29-30). From this large dataset, in one embodiment, eight Env variants were chosen for immunization based on three major criteria: Env mutants with sites under diversifying selection, in which the transmitted/founder (T/F) Env form vanished below 20% in any sample, i.e. escape variants; signature sites based on autologous neutralization data, i.e. Envs with statistically supported signatures for escape from members of the CHI 03 bnAb lineage; and sites with mutations at the contact sites of the CHI 03 antibody and HIV Env. From a set of candidate envs, eight Envs with mutations in these characteristic sites and representative of Envs with these criteria were chosen. In this manner, a sequential swarm of Envs was selected for immunization to represent the progression of virus escape mutants that evolved during bnAb induction and increasing neutralization breadth in the CH505 donor. [0124] In certain embodiments, additional two sequences are selected to contain five additional specific amino acid signatures of resistance that were identified at the global population level. These sequences contain statistically defined resistance signatures, which are common at the population level and enriched among heterologous viruses that CHI 03 fails to neutralize. When they were introduced into the TF sequence, they were experimentally shown to confer partial resistance to antibodies in the CHI 03 lineage. Following the reasoning that serial viral escape and antibody adaptation to escape is what ultimate selects for neutralizing antibodies that exhibit breadth and potency against diverse variants, in certain embodiments, inclusion of these variants in a vaccine may extend the breadth of vaccine-elicited antibodies even beyond that of the CH103 lineage. Thus the overarching goal will be to trigger a CH103-like lineage first using the CH505TF modified Mi l, that is well recognized by early CH103 ancestral states, then vaccinating with antigenic variants, to allow the antibody lineage to adapt through somatic mutation to accommodate the natural variants that arose in CH505. In certain embodiments, vaccination regimens include a total of eight sequences (Selection H) that capture the antigenic diversity of CH505. In another embodiment, the two sequences that introduce the population signatures are added (Selection I), to enable the induction of antibodies by vaccination that may have even greater breadth than those antibodies isolated from CH505. [0125] The eight CH505 sequences that represent the accumulation of viral sequence and antigenic diversity in the CD4bs epitope of CHI 03 in subject CH505: Mi l (TF with N279D + V281G), w004.03, w030.28, w053.16, w053.31, w078.15, w078.33, wl00.B6. [0126] Mi l is a mutant generated to include two mutations in the loop D (N279D + V281G relative to the TF sequence) that enhanced binding to the CHI 03 lineage (see Figure 29). These were early escape mutations for another CD4bs autologous neutralizing antibody lineage, but might have served to promote early expansion of the CHI 03 lineage. [0127] In certain embodiments, the two CHI 03 resistance signature-mutation sequences added to the antigenic swarm are: M14 (TF with S364P), and M24 (TF with S375H + T202K + L520F + G459E) (See Fig. 30). They confer partial resistance to the TF with respect to the CH103 lineage. In certain embodiments, these D-loop mutants are administered in the boost. [0128] In certain embodiments, two additional CH505 variants, w078.7 & wl00.A4, are added to the selections to extend to further extend the sampling of the antigenic profile. Example 3 [0129] Immunization protocols in subjects with swarms of HIV-1 envelopes. [0130] Immunization protocols contemplated by the invention include envelopes sequences as described herein including but not limited to nucleic acids and/or amino acid sequences of gpl60s, gpl50s, gpl45, cleaved and uncleaved gpl40s, gpl20s, gp41s, N-terminal deletion variants as described herein, cleavage resistant variants as described herein, or codon optimized sequences thereof.

The swarm immunization protocols can be administered in any subject, for example monkeys, mice, guinea pigs, or human subjects. [0131] In non- limiting embodiments, the immunization includes a nucleic acid is administered as DNA, for example in a modified vaccinia vector (MVA). In non- limiting embodiments, the nucleic acids encode gpl60 envelopes. In other embodiments, the nucleic acids encode gpl20 envelopes. In other embodiments, the boost comprises a recombinant gpl20 envelope. The vaccination protocols include envelopes formulated in a suitable carrier and/or adjuvant, for example but not limited to alum.

Example 4 [0142] Env mixtures of the CH505 virus induce the beginning of CD4 binding site BnAb lineages [0143] Groups of Rhesus Macaques are immunized with CH505 gpl20 variants as recombinant gpl20 proteins: T/F, w053.16, w078.33, and wl00.B6.

[0144] Immunizations are ongoing, with only three immunizations thus far with recombinant gpl20 proteins. Figure 26 shows interim results of one monkey from Group 1. Figures 26 and 27 show that three immunizations with CH505 T/F envelope stimulate reactive memory B cells which are RSC3 positive (bind the gpl20 CH505 T/F envelope) and do not bind RSCD371 (indicative of CD4Binding Site bnAb antibodies). [0145] Previous studies have shown evolution of BnAbs through autologous Nabs. For example, it was reported evolution of V3 glycan (PGT-like) antibodies by induction of autologous NAbs that drove T/F virus escape with appearance of N332 in escape mutants, that could drive N332- dependent BnAbs (Nature Med. 18: 1688, 2012). Liao et al. reported evolution of the CH103 lineage through autologous NAbs in the CHI 03 lineage (Nature 496: 469, 2013). [0146] Two virus types were isolated from CH505 BnAb individual four weeks after transmission: the Transmitted /Founder virus and a variant termed week 004.3 (4.3). Transmitted/founder virus was the predominant virus quasi-species at week 4 (tier 2). One variant virus termed 4.3 is identical to the T/F virus except it has a mutation in the gp41 MPER of W680G, and it is more neutralization sensitive to the entire CHI 03 clonal lineage including being neutralized by the CHI 03 UCA (Tier lb). [0147] Figure 28 shows induction of autologous neutralization of both the transmitted/founder CH505 Env and neutralization sensitive CH505 Env variant w004.3 in NHPs immunized with recombinant gpl20 forms of either the transmitted/founder Env, week 53.16, week 78.33 or week 100.B6 in either group 1, T/F alone X3 or in sequence (Group 4) or additive sequence (Group 5) as in line 117 above. Shown is week 14 neutralization data after three immunizations recombinant gpl20 proteins as describe above. [0148] Following virus and antibody evolution is providing important insight into the sequence of virus Envs that induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. B cell lineage vaccine design is a strategy to target the unmutated common ancestors and their intermediates for selecting otherwise subdominant and unfavored lineages. Lineage design coupled with structural analysis of envelope-antibody co-crystals is providing a rational design of immunogens for pre-clinical immunization studies. This example demonstrated induction of autologous neutralizing antibodies of the CHI 03 lineage. Next steps are immunization of germline KI mouse models (CHI 03 GL on the way) and humans with the same immunogens. Example 5: [0149] One of the major obstacles to developing an efficacious preventive HIV-1 vaccine is the challenge of inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the virus. There are several reasons why eliciting bnAbs has been challenging and these include the conformational structure of the viral envelope, molecular mimicry of host antigens by conserved epitopes which may lead to the suppression of potentially useful antibody responses, and the high level of somatic mutations in the variable domains and the requirement for complex maturation pathways [1-3]. It has been shown that up to 25% of HIV-1- infected individuals develop bnAbs that are detected 2-4 years after infection. To date, all bnAbs have one or more of these unusual antibody traits: high levels of somatic mutation, autoreactivity with host antigens, and long heavy chain third complementarity determining regions (HCDR3s)— all traits that are controlled or modified by host immunoregulatory mechanisms. Thus, the hypothesis has been put forth that typical vaccinations of single primes and boosts will not suffice to be able to induce bnAbs; rather, it will take sequential immunizations with Env immunogens, perhaps over a prolonged period of time, to mimic bnAb induction in chronically infected individuals [4]. [0150] A process to circumvent host immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in control of bnAbs is termed B cell lineage immunogen design, wherein sequential Env immunogens are chosen that have high affinities for the B cell receptors of the unmutated common ancestor (UCA) or germline gene of the bnAb clonal lineage [4]. Envs for immunization can either be picked randomly for binding or selected, as described herein, from the evolutionary pathways of Envs that actually give rise to bnAbs in vivo. Liao and colleagues recently described the co- evolution of HIV- 1 and a CD4 binding site bnAb from the time of seroconversion to the development of plasma bnAb induction, thereby presenting an opportunity to map out the pathways that lead to generation of this type of CD4 binding site bnAb [5]. They showed that the single transmitted/founder virus was able to bind to the bnAb UCA, and identified a series of evolved envelope proteins of the founder virus that were likely stimulators of the bnAb lineage. Thus, this work presents the HVTN with an opportunity to vaccinate with naturally-derived viral envelopes that could drive the desired B-cell responses and induce the development of broad and potent neutralizing antibodies. While the human antibody repertoire is diverse, it has been found that only a few types of B cell lineages can lead to bnAb development, and that these lineages are similar across a number of individuals [6,7]. Thus, it is feasible that use of Envs from one individual will generalize to others. [0151] The approach in this concept sheet to address the challenge of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies in vaccinees involves selecting the Env immunogens, among multitude of diverse viruses that induced a CD4 binding site bnAb clonal lineage in an HIV-infected individual, by making sequential recombinant Envs from that individual and using these Envs for vaccination. The B-cell lineage vaccine strategy thus includes designing immunogens based on unmutated ancestors as well as intermediate ancestors of known bnAb lineages. A candidate vaccine could use transmitted/founder virus envelopes to, at first, stimulate the beginning stages of a bnAb lineage, and subsequently boost with evolved Env variants to recapitulate the high level of somatic mutation needed for affinity maturation and bnAb activity. The goal of such a strategy is to selectively drive desired bnAb pathways. [0152] Liao et al demonstrated that in the CHAVI CH505 bnAb individual, the CH103 CD4 binding site bnAb lineage started with the lineage members first developing autologous neutralizing antibody activity, and then as the CH505 Env mutated, it developed bnAb activity. Thus, the first step of bnAb development is the development of the ability to neutralize the transmitted/founder virus. [0153] The CH505 transmitted/founder (T/F) virus that we propose to use in Trial 1 in the concept has been tested in rhesus macaques; after 3 immunizations it induced plasma antibodies that neutralized the T/F virus and an early (week 4) T/F variant with only one mutation. In addition, flow phenotypic analysis of memory B cells in CH505 T/F Env-immunized rhesus macaques has demonstrated the presence of antigen-specific memory B cells that bind the Env protein RSC3 but not the RSC3 371 mutant protein [8], strongly indicating B cells that have begun a CD4 binding site bnAb lineage. [0154] In certain embodiments, the CH505 virus used in Trial# 1 and Trial #2 is w004.03 instead of CH505 T/F. [0155] Broadly neutralizing antibodies likely will not be induced by a single Env, and even a mixture of polyvalent random Envs (e.g. HVTN 505) is unlikely to induce bnAbs. Rather, immunogens must be designed to trigger the UCAs of bnAb lineages to undergo initial bnAb lineage maturation, and then use sequential immunogens to fully expand the desired lineages. The proposed trial will represent the first of many experimental clinical trials testing this concept in order to develop the optimal set of immunogens to drive multiple specificities of bnAbs. The HVTN will be at the cutting edge of this effort. [0156] The concept is applicable to driving CD4 binding site lineage in multiple individuals due to the convergence of a few bnAb motifs among individuals. The adjuvant will be the GSK AS01E adjuvant containing MPL and QS21. Other suitable adjuvants can be used. This adjuvant has been shown by GSK to be as potent as the similar adjuvant AS01B but to be less reactogenic using HBsAg as vaccine antigen [Leroux-Roels et al., IABS Conference, April 2013,9]. [0157] Trial #1 will involve 5 immunizations IM with the CH505 transmitted/founder (T/F) Env gpl20 at months 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 and evaluating different doses of protein. The follow up Trial #2 will have combinations of the T/F Env and week-53, week-78 and week-100 Env mutants. Because it takes over a year to develop bnAbs, the second trial will include the possibility of a month 18 boost as well. [0158] This study aims to be the first of several iterative experimental phase I trials to test the ability of these Envs to initiate bnAb lineages, and to use the isolated B cells from the vaccinees to identify the lineages induced. [0159] Hypotheses: The T/F vaccine strategy will be safe and well tolerated among HIV- uninfected individuals. The vaccine strategy will elicit HIV Env-specific binding antibodies in a dose-dependent manner. The vaccine will elicit autologous neutralizing antibodies to transmitted/founder viruses. The vaccine will induce CD4+T cell responses. The vaccine will initiate CD4 binding site-specific-antibody lineages.

Assuming an acceptable safety and immunogenicity profile, trial #2 would follow with combinations of the T/F Env and week 53, 78 and 100 Env mutants. The doses for trial #2 will be informed by data from Trial #1. Because it takes over a year to develop bnAbs, the second trial will include the possibility of a month 18 boost as well.

All express gpl60 Env protein. In certain embodiments, bivalvent mosaic envelopes can be used. Placebo: sodium chloride for injection. [0186] Statistical considerations [0187] Accrual and sample size calculations: Recruitment into trial #lwill target 42 healthy, HIV-uninfected adults aged 18 to 50 years old at low risk of HIV infection in regions where clade B is the predominant clade. Enrollment will be concurrent with receiving the first study vaccination, thus all participants will provide some safety data. For immunogenicity analyses, however, it is possible that data may be missing for various reasons such as participants terminating from the study early, problems in shipping specimens, or low cell viability of processed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Immunogenicity data from 11 phase 1 and 1 phase 2a HVTN trials, which began enrolling after June 2005 (data as of June 2011), indicate that 10% is a reasonable estimate for the rate of missing data. For this reason, the sample size calculations below account for 10% of enrolled participants having missing data for the primary immunogenicity endpoint. [0188] Sample size calculations for safety: The ability of the study to identify SAEs can be expressed by the true event rate above which at least 1 event would likely be observed and the true event rate below which no events would likely be observed. Specifically, in each vaccine arm of the study (n = 12), there is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate of such an event is 17.5% or more; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the true rate is 0.8%) or less. In all vaccine arms of the study combined (n = 36), there is a 90%> chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate of such an event is 6.2% or more; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the true rate is 0.2% or less. [0189] Sample size calculations for immunogenicity: To address antibody endpoints, the analysis will descriptively summarize binding response positivity call rates and test superiority of the magnitude and breadth of the IgG binding Ab response to a panel of gpl20 proteins for each of two comparisons (Group 1 vs 2, Group 2 vs 3), using a two- sided Wilcoxon rank sum test with 2.5% type-I error rate per comparison. The sample size of 12 vaccinees per group will give 80%) power to detect a true difference of 1.82 standard deviations (SDs) between the mean nonzero responses and 90%> power to detect a true difference of 2.04 SDs. These calculations assume a 10%) loss-to-follow-up rate and the (94%>) response rate observed in the HVTN 088 vaccine recipients. The same approach will be used to test superiority of the magnitude of the IgG binding Ab response to each individual gpl20 antigen in the panel. [0190] References: [0191] 1. Mascola JR, Haynes BF.

Example 6 [0200] DNA and mRNA vaccination for mimicking HIV envelope evolution during broad neutralizing antibody induction [0201] In certain aspects the invention provides compositions and methods for HIV-1 vaccine development: DNA and RNA delivery system (for example but not limited by the Nanotaxi® nanoparticle delivery technology), as well as the B Cell Lineage Vaccine Design concept. This example will study the hypothesis that the critical factor for generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is exposure of the B cell repertoire to swarms of Env mutants that have developed over time such that the B cells induced both retain the ability to neutralize swarms of autologous viruses, while acquiring the ability to neutralize heterologous viruses. [0202] B Cell lineage vaccine design concepts envision multiple immunogens to target the unmutated common ancestors (UAs) and intermediate antibodies (IAs) of clonal lineages of potentially protective antibodies to induce these UAs to begin maturation to generate protective antibody responses. Translational studies aimed at testing such concepts are required; however, the key would be to select appropriate immunogens that can be easily delivered either as a mix or in sequential manner and to determine the appropriate frequency of administrations. Nanotaxi®- based immunogens allows for easy handling and manipulations for such a complex set of vaccine immunogens. [0203] The example will use the new CH505 set of T/F and sequential evolved Env envelopes (in certain embodiments the set includes 103/104 envelopes— Table 14) that gave rise to the CHI 03 bNAb lineage to generated broadly neutralizing CD4 binding site (bs) bnAb responses. In certain embodiment, w004.03 envelope is used instead of CH505 T/F envelope. In certain embodiments, D-loop mutants are optionally included. The CH505 set of Envs is derived from the CHAVI bnAb individual, CH505 who is one of the CHAVIOOl cohort of Africans who were followed from the time of acute HIV infection to the development of high titers of bnAbs. CH505 plasma neutralizing activity and resulting CHI 03 lineage bnAbs are targeted to the CD4 binding site (Nature 496: 469, 2013). A series of evolved viruses were chosen which will be tested as either m NAs or DNAs, for example but not limited administered by the Nanotaxi® technology. [0204] Once synthesized, the Nanotaxi® immunogens will be fully characterized as chemical entities using existing analytical approaches. Physico-chemical analyses will be performed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Mass Spectrometry (MS) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to ensure both the identity and the purity of the compounds. Once the Nanotaxi® are prepared, they will be formulated with DNA and mRNA, following a self- assembling process. The formulation will in turn be characterized, in terms of size and zeta potential of the complexed Nanotaxi®. [0205] Stage 1. Comparison of the immunogenicity of DNAs vs. mRNAs expressed in Nanotaxi® formulation. For this comparison, we will make 4 sequential CH505 Envs as DNA vs mRNA gpl20s and gpl60s in the presence or in the absence of an immunostimulatory sequence (IS) linked to the CH505 env genes and then formulate them with Nanotaxi® and test their immunogenicity in C57BL6 mice for their ability to induce anti-Env antibodies. Each of the 4 Envs will be tested both alone as a prime-boost injection model, and with recombinant protein administered either as a boost or co-administered with the DNA or mRNA. In certain embodiments gpl45 is used instead of gpl60. [0206] Below is a list of groups to be tested: [0207] Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4- Immunization with each gpl20 DNA formulated with Nanotaxi® X4. [0208] Groups 5, 6, 7 and 8- Immunization with each gpl20-IS DNA formulated with Nanotaxi® X4. [0209] Groups 9, 10, 11 andl2- Immunization with each gpl60 DNA formulated with Nanotaxi® X4. [0210] Groups 13, 14, 15 and 16- Immunization with each gpl60-IS formulated with DNA Nanotaxi® X4. [0211] Groups 17, 18, 19 and 20- Immunization with each gpl20 mRNA formulated with Nanotaxi® X4. [0212] Groups 21, 22, 23, and 24- Immunization with each gpl20-IS mRNA formulated with Nanotaxi® X4. [0213] Groups 25, 26, 27 and 28- Immunization with each gpl60 mRNA formulated with Nanotaxi® X4. [0214] Groups 29, 30, 31 and 32- Immunization with each g l60-IS mRNA formulated with Nanotaxi® X4. [0215] Groups 33, 34, 35 and 36- Immunization with each Env gpl20 protein alone X4 [0216] Groups 37, 38, 39 and 40- Immunization with each Env gpl40 protein alone X4 [0217] Groups 41, 42, 43 and 44- Immunization with each Env as optimal genetic form from studies above (mRNA vs. DNA with or without the immunostimulatory sequence (IS); gpl20 vs. gpl60) in sequential format. [0218] Groups 45, 46, 47 and 48- Immunization with each Env as optimal genetic form from studies above (mRNA vs. DNA with or without the immunostimulatory sequence(IS); gpl20 vs. gpl60) in sequential format, combined with four homologous Envs as proteins— delivered simultaneously with mRNA or DNAs. [0219] All immunizations will be performed intramuscularly (IM) with 6 C57BL6 mice per group. Mouse immunizations will be followed for induction of titers of CH505 Env antibodies by ELISA. Other suitable non-human animal models can be used. [0220] Once comparisons are made per above, a series of comparisons will be made of the optimal genetic immunizations given IM alone vs IM with Nanotaxi® as follows to ensure that Nanotaxi® is the optimal administration mode. [0221] Group 49- Immunization with DNA or mRNA alone IM X4 [0222] Group 50- Immunization with DNA or mRNA formulated with Nanotaxi® IM X4. [0223] Stage 2. Study of the immunogenicity of the optimized DNA or mRNA CH505 gpl60 or gpl20 Envs formulated with Nanotaxi® in CD4 binding site CHI 03 germline knockin mice and rhesus macaques. Here we will take the most immunogenic form of genetic immunization from Stage 1 and formulate 100 sequential evolved Envs for administration in the following manner: [0224] For CH103 germline knockin mice: [0225] Group 1 Immunization with DNA or mRNA formulated with Nanotaxi® with CH505 transmitted/founder (T/F) Env first, followed by a mixture of the next Envs, followed by a mixture of the next 33 Envs, followed by a mixture of the final Envs. Loop D mutants could be included in either prime and/or boost. [0226] Group 2 Immunization with DNA or mRNA formulated with Nanotaxi® with CH505 transmitted/founder (T/F) Env first, followed by a mixture of the next 32 Envs, followed by a mixture of the next 33 Envs, followed by a mixture of the final 33 Envs. Here the genetic immunization will be the same as in group 1 except each immunization will be accompanied by 4 (T/F, week 53, week 78, week 100) CH505 Env protein as gpl20s. [0227] For Rhesus Macaques (NHP study #79) [0228] Key is to determine how long it is necessary to immunize and what a precise regimen might be regarding sequential, additive or swarm types if immunizations. NHP study #79 is already ongoing and can inform the work by determining how long immunizations are needed and also by providing a protein only control set of experiments. [0229] NHP #79 is divided into 6 groups (4 animals per group) as follows: [0230] Group 1. Immunization with the Transmitted/Founder Env gpl20 alone X5; last immunization finished 11/21/13; induced autologous (CH505 T/F) neutralizing antibodies (slides 1 and 2 above) ; animals now being studied for VH and VL lineages induced. Once autologous Nabs isolated, plans are next to boost with "swarm" of all 4 Envs. [0231] Group 2. Immunization with second Env (week 53) only X5. [0232] Group 3. Immunization with third Env (week 78) only X5. [0233] Group 4. Immunization with sequential T/F, then week 53, then week 78, then week 100 Env, then a swarm of all 4 was completed; induced autologous Neutralizing antibodies of CH505 founder virus (Figures 26-29); animals now being studied for VH and VL lineage induced. [0234] Group 5. Immunization with additive Envs (T/F first then T/F + 53; then T/F + 53 + 78; then T/F + 53 + 78 + 100) then swarm of all 4 ; last immunization finished 11/21/13; induced autologous neutralizing antibodies; animals now being studied for VH and VL lineages induced. [0235] Group 6. Immunization with fourth Env (week 100) only X5. [0236] It took -90 weeks for heterologous nAbs to appear in the CH505 plasma, and it took -136 weeks for full bnAb activity to appear. Thus, a major way the NHP #79 study can inform the future studies to project how long and how many immunizations will be needed using genetic immunization. [0237] Secondly, a key protocol to evaluate is the contribution of protein to genetic immunization when proteins are added to m NA or DNA immunizations. We believe that that the most effective way to immunize will likely be the simultaneous combination of nucleotides in Nanotaxi® plus proteins. Thus, the NHP #79 studies probe the route and use of proteins alone. [0238] NHP Study for testing of genetic immunization of swarms of Envs in rhesus macaques. [0239] Group 1 Immunization with DNA or mRNA formulated with Nanotaxi® with CH505 transmitted/founder (T/F) Env first, followed by a mixture of the next Envs, followed by a mixture of the next Envs, followed by a mixture of the final Envs. [0240] Group 2 Immunization with DNA or mRNA formulated with Nanotaxi® with CH505 transmitted/founder (T/F) Env first, followed by a mixture of the next Envs, followed by a mixture of the next Envs, followed by a mixture of the final Envs. Here the genetic immunization will be the same as in group 1 except each immunization will be accompanied by 4 (T/F, week 53, week 78, week 100) CH505 Env protein as gpl20s. [0241] All immunizations will be performed IM with 6 rhesus macaques per group. Immunizations will continue for 2.5 years in the rhesus macaques. NHP immunizations will be followed for induction of titers of CH505 Env antibodies, and the repertoire of clonal lineages of antibodies induced will be determined by a) memory B cell sorts using the CH505 gpl20 as a fluorophor-labeled "hook", b) clonal memory B cell cultures with screening for single cells producing bnAbs, c) Atreca Inc. (Immune Repertoire Capture™ technology ) screens of extent of clonal diversity using either plasma cells or memory B cells sorts with maintenance of VH and VL natural pairs, and d) Illumina MiSeq analysis of clonal expansions in NHPs with the vaccinations. [0242] In addition, we will genetic immunizations in two types of humanized mice: the KYMAB® lambda mice (CH103 utilizes VA3-1) and our CH103 knockin mice that only express the germline VH4-59 and V13-1 genes of CH103 lineage. The latter mice will test the integrity of the Env immunogens for triggering of the CHI 03 lineage in the absence of germinal center competition for space by other clones, and the KYMAB® lambda mice will test the immunogens in a wildtype repertoire system much as in the rhesus macaques. [0243] For both mouse lines, we will test 12 mice per group and the mode of monitoring the response will be identical to that in rhesus macaques. [0244] Each of the models above has their advantages and disadvantages. [0245] The CHI 03 GL mouse has the advantage of being able to see exactly what the CH505 immunogens can do for the CHI 03 lineage. The disadvantage is that the T cells are mouse and the Ig repertoire is human. [0246] The KYMAB lambda mouse has the advantage of having the entire VH and Vlambda human repertoire and has the disadvantage of having mouse T helper cells and TFH. [0247] The rhesus has the advantage of being primate and being most similar to human in repertoire and TFH cells with the disadvantage of cost and not being human. Nonetheless, the rhesus macaque for these immunogenicity studies is most like human of all the models and if our strategy works in rhesus macaques, we believe this is the best indicator that it will work in humans. [0248] Stage 3. GMP Production of the 100 "Swarm" of CH505 Evolved Envs As Either DNAs or mRNAs (Downselected from Stage 1 above). [0249] This stage of the project will consist in producing by subcontracting with a GMP manufacturer of plasmid DNA or mRNA molecules depending on the selected format. Subcontractors have already been identified by the members of the present proposal. Discussion with manufacturers will aim to define the timelines and the cost for the production of the 100 "swarm" of CH505 Evolved Env as DNAs or mRNAs. For proteins, the CH505 T/F, week 53, week 78 and week 100 gpl20 Envs are already produced in bulk under GMP conditions for use in Phase I clinical trials, and these Envs will be available to for use with genetic immunization in Phase 1 trials should the genetic immunizations as "swarms" be successful in CHI 03 knockin mice and/or rhesus macaques. [0250] Milestones [0251] Stage 1. Decide on mRNA vs DNA regarding optimal immunogenicity in C57BL/6 mice. Criteria for deciding will be based on titers of CH505 Env antibodies in mouse plasma. [0252] Stage 2. Criteria for proceeding to GMP DNA or mRNA production with Nanotaxi® formulation will be the demonstration in the CHI 03 bnAb germline knockin mice of the DNA or mR A/NanoTaxi® formulation to induce clonal lineages of VH4-59— the VH of the CHI 03 lineage, or νλ3-1, or induce any clonal lineages with binding to RSC3 protein but not to the RSC3 protein with an isoleucine deleted at position 371 (signifying a CD4 binding site BnAb lineage). [0253] Similarly, criteria for proceeding to GMP DNA or mRNA production with Nanotaxi® formulation in KYMAB lambda mice and rhesus macaques will be for the DNA or mRNA/NanoTaxi® formulation to induce clonal lineages of the orthologues of VH4-59— the VH of the CHI 03 lineage, or orthologues of νλ3-1, or induce any clonal lineages with binding to RSC3 protein but not to the RSC3 protein with an isoleucine deleted at position 371 (signifying a CD4 binding site BnAb lineage). [0254] Thus, if either the right lineages are induced in the CHI 03 germline knockin mouse model or in KYMAB lambda mice or in rhesus macaques, we will move forward to GMP production. We will have this very high bar as a go-no go decision, since moving to stage 3 will be relatively expensive. That is to say, we will need to know our immunogens are inducing the correct lineages prior to moving to Stage 3. [0255] Stage 3. Criteria for moving to a Phase I clinical trial will be the above immunogenicity in rhesus macaques, and the ability to scale up and produce the 100 Envs as DNAs or RNAs with NanoTaxi®. 1.
