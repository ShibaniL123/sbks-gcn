BACKGROUND The present invention relates to medical uses of alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) agonists. Before surgical operations (in the perioperative period), patients are put under anesthesia; said anesthesia is maintained during surgical operations. There are two general types of anesthesia: general anesthesia and regional anesthesia. General anesthesia is typically performed during relatively large, complicated surgeries. In USA alone, nearly 60,000 patients per day receive general anesthesia for surgery (Brown E L et al, New England Journal of Medicine, 2010, 363, 2638-2650). General anesthesia can be regarded as a reversible loss of consciousness caused by general anesthetics. General anesthesia is characterized by three periods: the induction period, the maintenance period, and the emergence period. In the induction period, the subject loses consciousness. Said loss of consciousness is maintained during the maintenance period. In the emergence period, the subject regains consciousness. Emergence from anesthesia is complete when the subject is (i) conscious, (ii) able to answer simple questions, (iii) able to make voluntary movements, (iv) maintains adequate ventilation and (v) is able to protect his airways. Induction/maintenance of general anesthesia is an active process, wherein loss of consciousness is caused/maintained by treatment of patients with general anesthetics. In contrast, emergence from general anesthesia is a passive process whereby general anestethics are merely discontinued, typically at the end of surgery. Although the actions of many other drugs used in anesthesiology are pharmacologically reversed when no longer desired; e.g. muscle relaxants (e.g. sugammadex reversing the action of rocuronium) and opioids (e.g. naloxone as reversing agent); this is not the case for loss of consciousness induced by general anesthetics. This current clinical practice of passive emergence can be dangerous because patients may be susceptible to potentially severe complications, e.g. laryngospasm, respiratory depression, hemodynamic instability, anesthesia-related delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). In addition, significant time and labor are spent by hospitals on the care of patients under general anesthesia in operating rooms/intensive care units. Time for emergence from general anesthesia can be unpredictable as it depends on many factors related to the patient, the type of anesthetic given and the length of surgery. Depending on circumstances, this passive emergence from general anesthesia may take hours. Causes for slow emergence from anesthesia may include overdose; duration and type of anesthetic given; and potentiation by other drugs. An overdose can be caused by e.g. delayed drug metabolism such as in renal or hepatic failure, and/or increased sensitivity to particular agents. Duration and type of anesthetic given: for inhalational anesthetics the speed of emergence is directly related to alveolar ventilation. Therefore hypoventilation is a frequent cause of delayed emergence. For intravenous anaesthetic agents, immediate recovery depends mainly on redistribution from blood and brain into muscle and fat. Patients given propofol for induction and/or maintenance recover faster than those receiving other agents because propofol is rapidly metabolised by the liver and possibly also at other extrahepatic sites. Elimination half-life is relatively fast (10 to 70 minutes), and it does not accumulate. With thiopentone however, whilst the initial drug effect is terminated by redistribution within 5 to 15 minutes, elimination is by oxidative metabolism in the liver at a rate of 15% per hour. It therefore has a long elimination half-life of 3.4 to 22 hours and as much as 30% of the dose may remain in the body at 24 hours. Cumulative effects may therefore become apparent when more than one dose is given. For most other intravenous anaesthetic drugs the termination of drug action depends on the time required to metabolise or excrete the drug (elimination or metabolic half-life) and in this situation, advanced age or renal or hepatic disease can prolong drug action. Potentiation by other drugs: prior ingestion of sedative premedication such as benzodiazepines, or alcohol, may potentiate the central nervous system depressant effects of anaesthetic and analgesic drugs, and may delay emergence from anaesthesia. For these reasons, there is a need to provide agents useful for the facilitation of emergence from general anesthesia.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein an “α7 nAChR agonist” is a compound that binds to a receptor comprising an α7 nAChR subunit in vivo and in vitro and is activating the receptor. Activation can be measured by the method disclosed in WO2001/85727, i.e. a functional affinity assay at the homomeric α7 nAChR carried out with a rat pituitary cell line stably expressing the α7 nAChR. As read out, the calcium influx upon stimulation of the receptor compared to epibatidine is used. “α7 nAChR agonists of the invention” according to the invention typically induce calcium influx of at least 50% of the maximal influx evoked by epibatidine with an EC50 value of at least 1 μM. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is selective for a receptor comprising a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 7 subunit, since such an agonist would be expected to cause fewer side effects than a non-selective agonist to a treated subject. An agonist being selective for a receptor comprising a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 7 subunit has a functional affinity to such a receptor to a much higher degree, e.g. at least 10-fold affinity difference in EC50 value, preferably at least 20-fold, more preferably at least 50-fold, compared to any other nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. To assess the affinity of the α7 nAChR agonists of the invention on other nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the method disclosed in WO2001/85727 can be used, i.e. to assess the affinity on human neuronal aa4β2 nAChR, a similar functional assay is carried out using a human embryonic kidney cell line stable expressing the human aa4β2 subtype and to assess the activity of the compounds of the invention on the “ganglionic subtype” and the “muscle type” of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, similar functional assays are carried out with a human embryonic kidney cell line stably expressing the human “ganglionic subtype” or a cell line endogenously expressing the human “muscle type” of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In the last 15 years much effort has been focused on developing selective α7 nAChR agonists leading to the discovery of many different chemotypes displaying said selective activity. These efforts are summarized the review from Horenstein et al (Mol Pharmacol, 2008, 74, 1496-1511, which describes no less than 9 different families of α7 nAChR agonists, in most of which selective agonists have been found. All compounds disclosed in FIG. 1 of said review are incorporated herein by reference. In fact, several drug candidates having an α7 nAChR agonist mode of action entered pre-clinical or even clinical testing (for review: Broad et al, Drugs of the Future, 2007, 32(2), 161-170; Romanelli et al, Expert Opin Ther Patents, 2007, 17(11), 1365-1377). Examples of such compounds—again belonging to a diversity of chemotypes—are MEM3454, MEM63908, SSR180711, GTS21, EVP6124, ABT107 and TC-5619.

Facilitation of Emergence from General Anesthesia: General anesthesia can be regarded as a reversible loss of consciousness actively induced and maintained by treatment of patients with general anesthetics. General anesthetics, when administered to subjects, cause general anesthesia. General anesthetics include intravenous anesthetics and inhalation anesthetics (gas anesthetics). Intravenous anesthetics, once injected, quickly reach the brain and cause loss of consciousness. Intravenous anesthetics are divided into short-acting and long-acting anesthetics. Widely used intravenous anesthetics are propofol; etomidate; barbiturates (e.g. methohexital, thiamylal and thiopental); benzodiazepines (e.g. midazolam); and ketamine. Propofol is one of the most commonly used intravenous anesthetics employed to induce and maintain general anesthesia. Inhalation anesthetics are generally volatile and have the advantage of being absorbed and discarded by the lungs. Said anesthetics are usually delivered using an anesthesia machine. Such a machine allows the user to (i) mix inhalation anesthetics, oxygen and ambient air; (ii) administer said mixture to the patient and (iii) monitor patient and machine parameters. Liquid inhalation anesthetics are vaporized in the machine. Widely used inhalation anesthetics are e.g. halogenated ethers (e.g. desflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, enflurane and/or methoxyflurane) which are often combined with nitrous oxide; halothane; and xenon. Inhalation anesthetics have a common characteristic of typically prompt induction of and emergence from general anesthesia. However, inhalation anesthetics have respiratory and cardiovascular side effects and may lead to coughing and laryngospasm. Although it is possible to induce and maintain general anesthesia solely by intravenous anesthetics or inhalation anesthetics, most commonly intravenous anesthetics and inhalation anesthetics are used in combination. Typically, an intravenous anesthetic is administered to induce general anesthesia and an inhalation anesthetic is administered for maintenance. The term “general anesthetic agent” as used herein refers to the agent causing general anesthesia in the subject to which the method of facilitation of emergence from general anesthesia is applied. Said general anesthetic agent may be a single general anesthetic or a plurality of different general anesthetics, e.g. two general anesthetics. In case of a plurality of different general anesthetics, the different general anesthetics may be used in different periods of general anesthesia, e.g. one general anesthetic for the induction period and another general anesthetic for the maintenance period. In one embodiment, the invention relates to facilitation of emergence from general anesthesia in a subject treated with a general anesthetic agent. In one embodiment, the general anesthetic agent is selected from an intravenous anesthetic and an inhalation anesthetic, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the general anesthetic agent is selected from propofol; etomidate; a barbiturate; a benzodiazepine; ketamine, a halogenated ether, alone or combined with nitrous oxide; halothane; and xenon; or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the general anesthetic agent is a combination of ketamine for the induction period and sevoflurane for the maintenance period. In general anesthesia, commonly further drugs are used. One example is a muscle relaxant, e.g. rocuronium, which facilitate intubation and/or surgery by paralyzing the skeletal muscle. Another example is an opioid which is used as analgesic agent. Opioids can be used to relieve pain of patients before, during or after surgery. The following opioids are frequently used during general anesthesia: alfentanil, fentanyl, remifentanil and sufentanil. During general anesthesia, arousal of the subject is not possible, the subject is unconscious and unresponsive. Furthermore, the subject is commonly under apnea and ventilation of the subject is mechanically controlled (normally by intubation). Subjects under general anesthesia must undergo continuous physiological monitoring to ensure safety. Typical monitored parameters are electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, inspired and expired gases, oxygen saturation of the blood (pulse oximetry) and temperature. “Emergence from general anesthesia” occurs after cessation of administration of the general anesthetic agent at doses causing general anesthesia. Emergence from general anesthesia is characterized by restoration of consciousness in the subject, restoration of ability to answer simple questions, restoration of mobility, and restoration of ability to maintain adequate ventilation/protect airways. First signs of awakening typically are the transition of the subject from apnea or machine-controlled breathing to irregular breathing and then to regular breathing. Emergence from general anesthesia may be associated with complications, e.g. anesthesia-caused delirium and/or POCD. Both complications may continue after emergence from anesthesia. “Anesthesia-caused delirium” may be emergence delirium or hypoactive emergence delirium which are described in Radtke et al (Minerva Anestiol 2010, 76(6), 394-403). Delirium is disturbance of consciousness and a change in cognition or a perception of mental dissociation that can include hallucinations, psychomotor agitation and delusions, and can include restlessness, incoherence, irritability, screaming and involuntary activity, as well as belligerent behaviours and disorientation. Delirium can be quantitated using the Ryker sedation-agitated scale (Lepouse et al, J Anesthesia, 2006, 96, 747-753), and includes assessment of eye contact, purposeful actions, awareness of surroundings, restlessness and inconsolability and the like. Emergence delirium may also referred to as emergence agitation which is a phenomenon occurring in children and adults in the immediate postoperative period. In children, emergence delirium is defined as a dissociated state of consciousness in which the child is inconsolable, irritable, uncompromising or uncooperative, typically trashing, crying, moaning or incoherent. Although generally self limiting (5-15 minutes), emergence delirium can be severe and may result in physical harm to the child and particularly the site of surgery. Signs and symptoms of anesthesia-caused delirium include excitement and alternating periods of lethargy followed by excitement and disorientation. Inappropriate behavior such as screaming and kicking and use of profanities may also occur. Also, the patients may not respond appropriately to commands. Anesthesia-caused delirium has the risk of injury to patient and/or hospital staff. Emergence delirium can occur after most inhalational agents, e.g. desflurane and sevoflurane, and intravenous agents, e.g. midazolam, remifentanil and propofol. Physiological causes of emergence delirium include age, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, intracranial injury, sepsis, alcohol withdrawal, airway obstruction, gastric dilatation, full bladder, pain, hypothermia, sensory overload, sensory deprivation and electrolyte disturbances. Pharmacological causes of emergence delirium include rapid emergence, ketamine, droperidol, benzodiazepines, metoclopramide, atropine, scopolamine, volatile anesthetics, central anticholinergic syndrome, neuroleptics, digoxin, beta-blockers, steroids, anticonvulsants and oral hypoglycemic. Risk factors for emergence delirium are known, e.g. age (e.g. ages 2-5 are most vulnerable), underlying medical condition, medication, CNS disorders, electrolyte disturbances, temperament, surgery type and anesthesia type. Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) relates to a decline in cognitive function, typically for weeks or months after surgery. Within the first week after surgery, 30-50% of patients have POCD, with no difference by age. At 3 months after surgery about 10-15% of patients have POCD, but at this time point, POCD is basically limited to the elderly (G Crosby and D J Culley, Anesthesia and Analgesia, 2011, 112(5), 999-1001). POCD is common after cardiac surgery; also exists after major non-cardiac surgery—although at a lower incidence (L S Rasmussen, Best practice & research in clinical anesthesiology, 2006, 20(2), 315-330). Patients with POCD are at an increased risk of death in the first year after surgery. The relevance of POCD is increasing, especially as more elderly patients are able to undergo successful minor and major surgeries. The term “subject” as used herein refers to a human being, especially to a patient, e.g. a perioperative patient. In one embodiment, the subject is a perioperative patient under general anesthesia. The term “facilitation of emergence from general anesthesia” as used herein refers to improving the speed and/or the quality of emergence from general anesthesia. The term “effective amount” as used herein typically refers to an α7 nAChR agonist of the invention amount which, when administered to a subject, is sufficient to provide facilitation of emergence from general anesthesia, i.e. is sufficient to measurably facilitate emergence of a subject from general anesthesia-induced unconsciousness; e.g. cause a measurable decrease in time to regain consciousness as compared to in the absence of the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention; and/or decreases anesthesia-caused delirium, and/or decreases the time period until the subject is able to answer simple questions. Effective amounts will vary depending e.g. on the severity, duration and type of anesthesia; the medical condition of the subject; on the nature and/or duration of the surgery and the age and/or physical condition of the subject. Effective amounts can further be detected by physiological effects, e.g. transition from apnea to irregular breathing or to regular breathing, time to righting (e.g. righting responses); time to emergence from anesthesia-induced unconsciousness; monitoring changes in electroencephalograms (e.g. when the subject shifts from low frequencies to higher frequencies in EEG power spectrum, the latter being the dominant pattern seen in the awakening state). Relevant assays to measure such effects include electroencephalogram, observation, spectrograms, arterial blood gas and hemodynamic recordings, measurements of respiratory rate, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. One aspect of the facilitation of emergence from general anesthesia is that said facilitation should have a minimal adverse effect on the patient. For example, facilitation may disturb nocturnal sleep in many patients. Highly relevant would be e.g. an agent that can be used to facilitate emergence from general anesthesia while producing only little or substantially no side effects. Further highly relevant for the facilitation of emergence from general anesthesia in elderly would be an agent that has a positive effect on POCD which may occur e.g. in elderly patients. Agents facilitating emergence from general anesthesia preferably shorten the period to full cognitive function after general anesthesia-induced unconsciousness and substantially do not affect the effectiveness of the surgery, post-surgery recovery period or long term cognitive function of the subject. The α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is typically administered to the subject after administration of the general anesthetic agent. In some embodiments, when the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered, the subject is no longer being treated with the general anesthetic agent. In some of said embodiments, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered to the subject immediately upon cessation of administration of the general anesthetic agent, such that as soon as the general anesthetic agent is stopped being administered, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered to the subject. In alternative embodiments, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered to the subject prior to cessation of treatment with the general anesthetic agent, e.g. immediately prior and/or in the last 10% of the surgery. In such embodiments, the dose of the general anesthetic agent can be reduced with an inverse relationship to the increasing dose of the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention, so that, for example, the dose of the general anesthetic agent is reduced concurrently with an increase in the dose of the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention. In some embodiments, the methods for emerging a subject from general anesthesia further comprises administering to the subject at least one other therapeutic agent with the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention, wherein the other therapeutic agent can be selected from the group consisting of an analgesic, pain medication and anti-inflammatory agent. Furthermore, an α7 nAChR agonist of the invention may be administered to a subject suffering from one or more symptoms of the anesthesia-caused delirium upon awakening. Furthermore, an α7 nAChR agonist of the invention can also be administered to an unconscious subject who is inadvertently or accidently oversedated with an general anesthetic agent. Administration/Dosing: In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by intravenous or intraarterial administration. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by intravenous administration. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by intravenous administration when the subject is no longer being treated with a general anesthetic agent. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered to a subject by intravenous administration, immediately after or just before stopping the administration of the general anesthetic agent. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by intravenous administration continuously, e.g. over the whole period the subject is regaining consciousness. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by continuous intravenous infusion. In one embodiment, the continuous intravenous infusion is by an infusion pump or by gravity drip. An infusion pump allows precise control over the flow rate and total amount delivered. However, in cases where a change in the flow rate would not have serious consequences, or if pumps are not available, the drip is often left to flow simply by placing the bag above the level of the patient and using the clamp to regulate the rate; this is the so-called “gravity drip” In one embodiment, the continuous intravenous infusion is by a rapid infuser. A rapid infuser can be used if the patient requires a high flow rate and the IV access device is of a large enough diameter to accommodate it. This is either an inflatable cuff placed around the fluid bag to force the fluid into the patient or a similar electrical device that may also heat the fluid being infused. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by multiple, e.g. two or more than two, continuous intravenous infusions which are separated by times of no infusion of the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by intermittent intravenous infusion. Intermittent infusion is used when a patient requires medications only at certain times, and does not require additional fluid. It can use the same techniques as an intravenous drip (pump or gravity drip), but after the complete dose of medication has been given, the tubing is disconnected from the IV access device. Some medications are also given by IV push or bolus, meaning that a syringe is connected to the IV access device and the medication is injected directly (slowly, if it might irritate the vein or cause a too-rapid effect). Once a medicine has been injected into the fluid stream of the IV tubing there must be some means of ensuring that it gets from the tubing to the patient. Usually this is accomplished by allowing the fluid stream to flow normally and thereby carry the medicine into the bloodstream; however, a second fluid injection is sometimes used, a “flush”, following the injection to push the medicine into the bloodstream more quickly. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by bolus injection. The α7 nAChR agonist of the invention may be administered as a bolus injection immediately after surgery and then injected sequentially over time (episodically), e.g. every hour, until the subject regained consciousness. For the above-mentioned facilitation method the appropriate dosage will vary depending upon, for example, the compound employed, the host and the nature and severity of the anesthesia for which emergence is facilitated. The term “daily dosage” as used herein, unless stated otherwise, refers to the dosage of the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention administered to a subject within 24 hours. For example, in animals a daily dosage of an α7 nAChR agonist of the invention from 1 to 100 mg/kg body weight may be used, e.g from 1 to 50 mg/kg body weight, e.g. about 10 mg/kg. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage may be in the range from 0.5 to 500 mg, e.g. from 1 to 200 mg, e.g. from 10 to 100 mg, e.g. about 75 mg of an α7 nAChR agonist of the invention. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by continuous intravenous infusion within 5 to 60 minutes, e.g. 10 to 60 minutes. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by continuous intravenous infusion within 10 to 30 minutes, e.g. 10 to 20 minutes. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by continuous intravenous infusion lasting at least 5 minutes. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered by continuous intravenous infusion lasting maximal 60 minutes. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered at a dose of 1 to 200 mg by continuous intravenous infusion within 10 to 60 minutes. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered at a dose of 10 to 100 mg by continuous intravenous infusion within 10 to 20 minutes. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered at a dose of about 75 mg by continuous intravenous infusion within 10 to 60 minutes. In one embodiment, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention is administered at a dose of about 75 mg by continuous intravenous infusion within 10 to 20 minutes. Patients may continue to receive an α7 nAChR agonist of the invention even after emergence has occurred, this may be particularly relevant for subjects facing/being at risk for POCD. In such situations, the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention may be administered for facilitation of emergence from general anesthesia by intravenous administration and after emergence by the same or another route of administration, e.g. by oral administration.

Water for injection up to 2.0 ml 2.0 ml Biological Examples The usefulness of α7 nAChR agonists of the invention in the facilitation of emergence from general anesthesia can be confirmed in a range of standard tests including those indicated below. 1. Preclinical Testing (In Vivo Pharmacology) 1.1 Orexin-Deficiency Model: a) Animals Male transgenic mice with a knockout of the orexin peptide gene are used. Orexin-deficient mice express a phenotype with cataplexy events (observed as ‘behavioral arrests’) and a disrupted sleep pattern including fragmented sleep and sleepiness in their active period. b) Assessment of Behavior The animals are observed and videotaped via infrared cameras during the first hours of the lights-off period which is the active phase of nocturnal rodents like mice. At this time, orexin-deficient mice show the most ‘behavioral arrests’. The number of these events can be furthermore increased by presenting a new environment. For this purpose, new saw dust, a running wheel, marbles and tunnels are placed in the test environment. The number of ‘behavioral arrests’ are offline counted by the experimenter for each hour of recording. Behavioral arrests were defined by phases of total inactivity outside the next box, which last longer than 10 second, preceded and followed by robust locomotor activity (see also Scammell et al., 2009, Sleep 32(1): 111-116). Some of the animals have temporal skull EEG electrodes implanted which are connected to transmitters. The EEG is recorded via a receiver and stored on a PC for further analysis. EEG is used to assess and to quantify sleep behavior and vigilance stage. c) Protocol A cross-over design is used because of the high inter- and intra-individual variability of the behaviors to be observed. Furthermore, to avoid habituation to the test environment, the animals are only tested once per week in the test environment. During the remaining days, the animals are in their homecage. For each experimental session, 3-4 mice are put into the test environment 3 hours before lights-off. The first experimental session (week 1) is used to get a baseline (without treatment). The second and third sessions (weeks 2+3) are used for treatment (vehicle & compound, cross-over design, administration 5 minutes before lights-off). The fourth and last experimental session is again without treatment to evaluate a post-treatment baseline. d) Results FIG. 1 depicts the effects of 3 mg/kg compound B-4, orally administered directly before lights-off, on the number of narcoleptic episodes (behavioral arrests) in orexin-deficient mice. Compound B-4 decreased the number of narcoleptic episodes during the whole 4 hours observation period by ca. 25% (Paired t-test: t14=2.48, p=0.03; FIG. 1A+B). The reduction was more pronounced during the first hour (ca. 47%; t14=2.32, p=0.04; FIG. 1C). FIG. 2 depicts the effects of 10 mg/kg compound B-1, orally administered directly before lights-off, on the number of narcoleptic episodes (behavioral arrests) in orexin-deficient mice. Compound B-1 significantly decreased the number of narcoleptic episodes during the first hour of the observation period by ca. 66% (p<0.05 Anova). 1.2 EEG Data a) Animals Animals have temporal skull EEG electrodes implanted which are connected to transmitters. Animals were group-housed (2-4) per cage at a constant temperature of 22±1° C., on a 12:12 light-dark schedule. The EEG is recorded via a receiver and stored on a PC for further analysis. EEG is used to assess and to quantify sleep behavior and vigilance stage. b) Protocol Animals were given a 1-day period of acclimatization in the recording cages with recording cables connected. On the 1st day of the experiment, EEG recordings were made continuously during a 22-hours period beginning at 11 A.M., 15 min after vehicle administration. On the second day of the experiment, EEG recordings were carried out in the same way, but 15 minutes after drug administration. In this way, each animal served as its own control. 10 animals were recorded from simultaneously in each experiment. Automatic evaluation of the nycthemeral cycle (REM sleep, classical sleep, wakefulness and an awake non-vigilant state termed “drowsiness”) was performed as described (Vigouret et al., 1978 Pharmacology 16 Suppl 1:156-73). In the present context, “quiet wake” and “active wake”, describe conscious animals in a resting and an active state, respectively, while “REM” and “NREM” represent sleep states. c) Results FIG. 3 depicts the effects of 30 mg/kg compound B-1, orally administered 6 h after lights on (9:00) in mice (n=10) on quiet wake (a frequency, 9.5-12.5 Hz), active wake (β frequency, 12.5-30.5 Hz; and γ frequency, >30.5 Hz), REM sleep (θ frequency, 4.5-9.5 Hz) and NREM sleep (δ frequency, <4.5 Hz). Assessment period shown is 3 hours. Compound B-1 causes a decline of NREM sleep and increases the time spent in quiet wake. The numerical assessment of FIG. 3 is given in table 1. TABLE 1 Mean difference drug-vehicle (min) assessed at time point 9:30 10:30 11:30 12:30 Quiet wake 14.3 6.1 −1.8 −0.9 (α frequency) Active wake 0.9 3.6 0.1 0.3 (β and γ frequencies) REM −2.2 −2.1 −0.9 −0.2 (θ frequency) NREM −12.4 −7.1 2.1 −0.1 (δ frequency) 1.3 Telemethyl Histamine Histamine (HA) is released all over the brain by tuberomammillary nucleus neurons. Evidence indicates that histaminergic neurons have a major role in wakefulness control. HA is metabolized by histamine-N-methyltransferase to tele-methylhistamine (tMHA) in some tissues, including brain. a) Protocol Mice (n=8) were treated during the first hour of the lights-on period and sacrificed 30 min later. Brain tissue was collected and subjected to LC-MS analysis (Croyal et al. Analytical Biochemistry, 2011, 409:28-36) to determine t-MHA levels. b) Results FIG. 4 depicts the effects of different doses of compound B1 and A-1, orally administered to mice, 30 minutes after administration on brain tMHA levels. tMHA levels are significantly elevated for compound B-1 at all doses tested. For compound A-1, a significant elevation is seen for the 10 mg/kg dose. 1.4 Signs for Emergence of Anesthesia in Nonhuman Primates Clear signs for emergence from general anesthesia after administration of an α7 nAChR agonist of the invention at a therapeutically relevant dose were seen in a positron emission tomography (PET) experiment otherwise unrelated to this disclosure. Said experiment was performed on the α7 nAChR in the non-human primate (NHP) brain. Said experiment resulted in relevant data on the effect of compound A-1 in non-human primates anesthesized with ketamine/sevoflurane. a) Methods: An animal (Cynomolgus monkey, male, 5.8 kg) was anesthesized for the entire duration of the PET experiment, i.e. for approximately 7.5 hours. Due to the nature of these experiments, it is crucial that anesthesia is maintained. General anesthesia was induced by i.m. injection of ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg, Ketaminol, Intervet AB). The animal was intubated and general anesthesia was maintained by inhalational administration of sevoflurane (1.5-8%, Abbott Scandinavia AB). Body temperature was maintained by Bair Hugger Model 505 (Arizant Healthcare Inc., Eden Prairie, Minn., USA). ECG, pulse, blood pressure, respiration rate, oxygen saturation and tidal CO2 level were monitored continuously during the experiment. Ventilation of the animal (breathing frequency and volume) was controlled by machine during the general anesthesia. The animal underwent two consecutive PET scans. The PET ligand was administered i.v. at doses too low to have a pharmacodynamic effect (i.e. total dose of 0.16 and 0.25 μg). Before the start of the second PET scan, 10 mg/kg of compound A-1 was administered to the animal using an oral gavage tube. b) Observations: No remarkable observations were made before/during/after administration of the PET ligand and during the PET scan. By completion of the first scan, anesthesia had successfully been maintained for about three hours by administration of 2.6-2.9% sevoflurane. Fifteen minutes after administration of compound A-1, surprisingly, shallow breathing was observed in the NHP, indicating that the animal did not accept the controlled breathing, but was trying to breath spontaneously in a potentially irregular pattern. This change in breathing behavior is a clear sign for emergence from general anesthesia. As it was crucial to maintain anesthesia, the dose of sevoflurane was immediately increased 1.7-fold (from 2.9% to 5%). The breathing behavior reverted directly to machine-controlled breathing with no shallow breathing, i.e. an anesthesia-like breathing behaviour. As a few minutes later a drop in blood pressure was observed. Hypotension is a known adverse event with sevoflurane in humans. Therefore, the dose of sevoflurane was decreased (from 5% to 3.7%). Shortly afterwards these changes in vitals spontaneously reverted and no further intervention was necessary. For the rest of the experiment (about two hours) anesthesia was successfully maintained, however higher doses of sevoflurane (3.0-3.7%) were necessary than during the first half of the experiment. c) Conclusions: In-life observations indicated awakening of the animal form anesthesia shortly after the administration of compound A-1, which indicates that compound A-1 may cause emergence from general anesthesia. 2. Clinical Testing: Clinical testing of the α7 nAChR agonist of the invention may be conducted, for example, in the following study design. The skilled physician may look at a number of aspects of patient behaviors and abilities.
