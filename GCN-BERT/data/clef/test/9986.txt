LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES Clematis lanuginosa×patens VARIETY DENOMINATION ‘PASSION PLUM’ BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The new cultivar is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventor during 2009. May of 2009, the inventor, Friedrich Manfred Westphal, a citizen of Germany, made a crossing of the seed parent Clematis lanuginosa ‘Carnaby’, unpatented, with the pollen parent, Clematis patens ‘Rosa Konigskind’, unpatented Seeds originating from this crossing were planted out, and the new variety was selected during 2010. All work was conducted at a commercial nursery in Prisdorf, Germany. The inventor first propagated ‘Passion Plum’ by vegetative cuttings at the commercial nursery in Prisdorf, Germany in April of 2010. Subsequent generations have shown that the unique features of this cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The cultivar ‘Passion Plum’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, day length, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘Passion Plum’ These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘Passion Plum’ as a new and distinct Clematis cultivar: 1. Very short, compact plant habit 2. Long flowering period, continuously throughout Summer 3. Distinctive dark pink flower, with a darker pink bar 4. Highly floriferous plant COMPARISON TO PARENT VARIETY Plants of the new cultivar ‘Passion Plum’ are similar to plants of the seed parent; Clematis lanuginosa ‘Carnaby’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘Passion Plum’ are shorter and more compact, and flower over a longer period. Additionally, plants of ‘Passion Plum’ produce flowers that are much darker pink. Plants of the new cultivar ‘Passion Plum’ are similar to plants of the pollen parent; Clematis patens ‘Rosa Konigskind’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘Passion Plum’ are shorter and more compact. Additionally, plants of ‘Passion Plum’ produce flowers that are much darker colored than the pollen parent. COMMERCIAL COMPARISON ‘Passion Plum’ can be compared to the commercial variety ‘Dorami’, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 21,740. ‘Passion Plum’ and ‘Dorami’ are similar in most horticultural characteristics, especially in compact plant habit and their continuous flowering characteristic. However, plants of ‘Passion Plum’ produce a dark pink and pink flower, compared to the purple flower of ‘Dorami’ ‘Passion Plum’ can also be compared to Clematis ‘Jenmar’ U.S. Plant Pat. No. 21,713. ‘Passion Plum’ and ‘Jenmar’ are similar in most horticultural characteristics, especially in compact plant habit and their continuous flowering characteristic. However, plants of ‘Passion Plum’ produce a dark pink and pink flower, compared to the purple flower of ‘Jenmar’. Additionally, the petal aspect is much different between the varieties. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH The accompanying photograph in FIG. 1 illustrates in full color a close up of typical foliage and flowers of ‘Passion Plum’ grown outdoors in Germany. The plant is approximately 1 year old, and is planted in the ground. The photograph was taken using conventional techniques and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance it is as accurate as possible by conventional photographic techniques.
