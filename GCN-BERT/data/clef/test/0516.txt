The United States government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND Myocardial infarction (MI) leads to heart failure implicated by complex mechanisms of cardiac myocyte cell death, hypertrophy and fibrosis. The common therapeutic preferences to inhibit further deterioration of MI leading to end stage heart failure are very restricted. While heart transplantation is required to manage end stage heart failure patients, it is not readily available. Moreover, the development, progression and pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI) in type II diabetes are complex and severe compared with age and sex matched non-diabetic patients. Therefore, new cellular therapies to repair and regenerate injured myocardium as well as to prevent the progression of adverse cardiac remodeling are under diligent examination. Cell therapy has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for repairing injured myocardium. Thus far, cell transplantation in the mouse, rat, and human infarcted hearts has been studied employing a wide variety of cell types such as skeletal myoblasts, embryonic stem (ES) cells, c-kit positive cardiac stem cells, CD45+ve bone marrow stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and hematopoietic stem cells. Indeed, adult stem cells in clinical trials have furnished significant insights into cell transplantation; however, their effectiveness is still in question. In contrast, ES cells have never reached clinical trials due to ethical and additional concerns. Thus, the optimal cell types for transplantation in the injured myocardium has yet to be identified. Despite advances in understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction, including myocardial infarction, there is still a scarcity of compounds that are both potent, efficacious, and safe in enhancing neovascularization and regeneration of the heart following MI. These needs and other needs are satisfied by the present invention.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. DESCRIPTION The present invention can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the invention and the Examples included therein. Recently identified induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) possess tremendous potential to treat heart disease, but their basic mechanisms of neovascularization in diabetic infarcted myocardium are largely unknown. Moreover, no attention has been paid to the dynamic and concurrent processes underlying post-MI neovascularization (angiogenesis and vasculogenesis), or the interaction of these processes with transplanted fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) primed neovascular committed iPS cells in non-diabetic and diabetic mice. The role of transplanted FGF-9 primed differentiated iPS cells or their conditioned medium (CM) in the endogenous activation of c-kit+ve and FLK1−ve cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) and c-kit+ Flk-1+ve progenitor cells (c-kit+ FLK-1+ve-PCs) has never been determined in non-diabetic and diabetic mice. Using four (4) factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc), iPS cells were generated from H9c2 cells (originally isolated from embryonic rat heart ventricular tissue). These cells, which are referred to herein as “4F-iPS cells” or “iPS cells,” have the potential to differentiate into cardiac myocytes in vitro and in vivo. Following myocardial infarction, transplanted cardiac iPS cells inhibited post-MI remodeling and demonstrated cardiac regeneration. A. COMPOSITIONS 1.

Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin, which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use. Suitable inert carriers can include sugars such as lactose.

Establishment of iPS Cell Lines and Differentiation of Cardiac Cell Type Stably transfected iPS cell lines expressing red fluorescence protein (RFP) were generated. (Park et al., 2008). H9c2 cells were transfected with an expression vector expressing mouse stemness four factors (i.e., the 4F expression vector). The four stemness factors were c-Myc, Oct 3/4, Klf4 and Sox2. FIG. 1 (panel A) shows that untransfected H9c2 cells are elongated (FIG. 1, left panel, scale bar=50 μm). Following transduction with the 4F expression vector, these cells appeared morphologically distinct (FIG. 1A, right panel) from the untransduced H9c2 cells. To determine whether these four factors were present in the generated iPS cells, western blot analysis was utilized to show expression for these four stemness factors in the iPS cells. Western blot analysis did not show the presence of any one of the four factors in the untransfected H9c2 cells, but showed increased expression of 4Fs was present in transduced H9c2. (FIG. 1, panel B). Next, whether generated iPS cells expressed pluripotency markers, such as alkaline phosphatase and Oct3/4, was next determined iPS cells expressed alkaline phosphatase in 100% of growing cells. Similar expression was observed in ES cells, which were used as a positive control (FIG. 1, panel C, scale bar=250 μm). In contrast, H9c2 cells were negative for alkaline phosphatase staining (FIG. 1, panel C). Growing iPS cells were positive for the undifferentiated pluripotent marker Oct3/4, which was compared with the positive control—ES cells (FIG. 1, panel D, scale bar=100 μm). These data indicate that generated iPS cells were reprogrammed and expressed pluripotent markers. (Singla et al., 2011) Whether the iPS cell lines retained the capability in vitro to differentiate into all three major heart cell types (i.e., cardiomyocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells) present and still express the desired reporter protein was evaluated. FIG. 2 shows that iPS cells formed embryoid bodies (EBs) and differentiated into cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Here, EBs were differentiated for 17 days. A beating area was stained with anti-myosin/Alexa 488 (panel A), anti-RFP/Alexa 568 (panel B) and DAPI (panel C). The merged image (panel C) shows co-expression of myosin and RFP. Smooth muscle cells were stained with anti-smooth muscle actin/Alexa 488 (panel D), anti-RFP/Alexa 568 (panel E) and DAPI (panel F). The merged image (panel F) shows overlap of expression of smooth muscle α-actin and RFP. Endothelial cells that have formed a capillary-like structure were stained with anti-von Willebrand Factor/Alexa 488 (panel G), anti-RFP/Alexa 568 (panel H) and DAPI (panel I). The merged image (panel I) shows co-expression of von Willebrand Factor and eGFP. b. FGF-9 Enhancement of EC and VSMC Differentiation from iPS Cells Normal embryonic cardiogenesis from mesodermal tissue requires growth factors and cytokines, including fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), wnt proteins, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), and transforming growth factor (TGF) β (Singla et al., 2005). Several cytokines have been shown to favor cell specific differentiation in mouse ES cells. IL-3 promotes differentiation to macrophages, mast cells, or neutrophils (Wiles et al., 1991), IL-6 to erythroid lineages (Biesecker et al., 1993), retinoic acid to neurons (Slager et al., 1993), and TGFβ to cardiac myocytes (Singla et al., 2005). Recombinant mouse insulin growth factor (IGF-1) was added to a suspension of undifferentiated mouse ES cells and subsequently transplanted into mouse hearts (Kofidis et al., 2005). This study demonstrated restoration of infarcted areas (increased donor graft/infarct ratio) with increased connexin-43 expression (Kofidis et al., 2005). Similarly, FGF family members play an important role in various cell signal transduction pathways associated with embryo development (Dyer et al., 2009; Yun et al., 2010). Reports on other FGF isoforms (FGF2, FGF4, and FGF-9) indicate a potential role in angiogenesis Yun et al., 2010; Frontini et al., 2011) in the heart whereas FGF-8 has been reported to be pro-cardiac myocyte growth factor in the developing heart (Dyer et al., 2009; Marques et al., 2008). Specifically, FGF-9 recently been reported to decrease mortality in mice following MI (Korf-Klingebiel et al., 2011). However, the role of FGF-9 or iPS cells in the injured diabetic adult heart has not yet been characterized. Therefore, whether iPS cells primed with FGF-9 increase neovascularization and regenerate the injured diabetic myocardium merits further investigation. The iPS-EB system was used to determine whether direct treatment with FGF-9 would promote EC and VSMC differentiation. EBs derived from iPS cells were treated with 0, 25, and 50 ng per mL of the bio-active form of recombinant mouse FGF-9 and were examined by microscopy from day 0 (DO) through day 14 (D14) after plating. FIG. 3A shows that FGF-9-treated EBs stained positive for CD31 specific for ECs, smooth muscle α-actin for VSMCs, anti-RFP for iPS cells, and DAPI for nuclear staining (panel A-B). Additionally, the bottom panel of FIG. 3 shows positive staining for von Willebrand factor VIII for ECs. FIG. 3B shows a histogram providing a quantitative analysis of ECs and VSMCs, demonstrating a significant increase in the number of positively stained cells at D14 following FGF-9 treatment. c. Identification of Factors Released from iPS-CM Whether cytokine/growth factors were present in the iPS-CMs and could provide protection from H2O2-induced apoptosis was examined 69 cytokine/growth factors were analyzed with the use of Luminex technology. (Singla et al., 2008; Singla et al., 2009). Cytoprotective proteins released into iPS-CM were present at higher levels as compared with the H9c2-CM, ES-CM, or cell culture media used as controls. Notably, FGF-9 was significantly increased in the iPS-CM as were FGF-8, IL-10, and TIMP-1.

Establishment of the Myocardial Infarction Model and Cardiac Neovascular Regeneration A previously characterized mouse MI model (Singla et al., 2006; Singla et al., 2007; Singla et al., 2001) was used to study iPS cell transplantation. MI was produced in C57BL/6 and db/db mice by left coronary artery ligation Immediately after coronary ligation, two intramyocardial injections of 10 μL of medium±2.5×104 iPS cells were delivered into peri-infarct zone areas of the LV. (Singla et al., 2006; Singla et al., 2007; Singla et al., 2001). iPS cells were injected in the LV of MI animals in both groups and compared with controls (FIG. 4). The fate of donor cells was determined with the use of co-immunolabeling for the donor cell marker and neovascular cell type-specific proteins. For example, an anti-smooth muscle anti-actin antibody was used to identify VSMCs, and an anti-CD31 antibody was used to identify ECs. In iPS cell transplanted hearts, anti-RFP immunolabeling demonstrated areas of donor cell engraftment in the infarct and border zones. Co-immunolabeling with an antibody specific for VSMCs and ECs revealed small and large artery regeneration. (FIG. 4). In FIG. 4, transplanted iPS cells following MI demonstrated neovascularization (panels A-D show vascular smooth muscle cells and panels E-H show endothelial cells). Panel A shows smooth muscle cells stained with anti-smooth muscle α-actin/Alexa568, and panel E shows endothelial cells stained with anti-CD31/Alexa568. Panels B and F show donor-derived cells stained with anti-RFP/Alexa 488 (in green) and panels C and G show nuclei stained with DAPI. The co-localization of cell type-specific markers and donor cell RFP in merged images (yellow) indicated that transplanted iPS cells became vascular smooth muscle (panel D), and endothelial cells (panel H). The arrows in panels D and H indicate enlarged areas in right hand corner. In the histogram shown in FIG. 4B, the quantitative data indicate that there was a significant (p<0.05) increase in the number of positively stained VSMCs (top panel) and ECs (bottom panel) in the MI+iPS group as compared with MI hearts. e. Effects of Transplanted iPS Cells and FGF-9 on C-Kit+ve-CPCs MI was produced in C57BL/6 and db/db mice by left coronary artery ligation. Cells were transplanted as described above whereas FGF-9 (1 ng/20 μL in two injections) was intramyocardially injected immediately after MI in two different injections in the peri-infarct zone. After D14, we examined c-kit+ve cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), CD31+ve ECs, SMα-actin and vascular cell apoptosis. Evidence of activated c-kit+ve cells and their co-staining with mature VSMC marker SM α-actin was identified. These findings indicated that transplanted iPS cell released factors or that FGF-9 activated c-kit+ve cells, which then differentiated into mature VSMCs. In FIG. 5, panels A-D show c-kit positive cell activation in neovascularization in vascular smooth muscle and panels E-H show activated c-kit+ve cells and co-staining with the mature EC marker CD31. Cell type-specific immunolabeling is indicated in red for smooth muscle (panel A) with anti-smooth muscle α-actin/Alexa568, and for endothelial cells with anti-CD31/Alexa568 (panel E). Activated c-kit positive cells were identified by anti-c-kit/Alexa 488 in green (panels B and F), and nuclei were stained with DAPI in blue (panels C and G). Co-localization of cell type-specific markers were merged images (yellow) indicating that activated c-kit positive cells have become VSMCs (panel D) and ECs (panel H). The arrows in panels D and H indicate enlarged areas. FIG. 5B shows a histogram presenting a quantitative analysis of positive c-kit+VSMCs (top panel) and c-kit+ECs (bottom panel). This quantitative data shows a significantly (*p<0.05) increased number of c-kit+ve+VSMCs and c-kit+ve+ECs in the MI+iPS and MI+FGF-9 groups as compared with MI. Moreover, a cytokine growth analysis that iPS cells secrete pro-angiogenic growth factor FGF-9 was confirmed. f. Effect of FGF-9 on Caspase Activity and Cell Death FIG. 6A shows caspase activity following treatment with glucose and H2O2 (GH2O2), or glucose and iPS cell conditioned media (GHICM), or glucose and iPS cell conditioned media and FGF-9 (GHICM+F9), or FGF-9 (F9). Control is represented by C. FIG. 6B shows cell death detection following treatment with treatment with H2O2 (H), or glucose and H2O2 (GH), or glucose and H2O2 (GH) and iPS cell conditioned media (GHICM), or H2O2 and iPS cell conditioned media and FGF-9 (HICM+F9), or glucose and H2O2 and iPS cell conditioned media and FGF-9 (GHICM+F9), or FGF-9 (F9). Control is represented by C. In FIG. 6B, black bars indicates that H9c2 cells were treated with H2O2 to induce cell death while gray bars indicated that glucose was provided to the H2O2 treated cells. g. Formation of Vessels Following iPS Cell and FGF-9 Transplantation To determine the effect of transplanted iPS cells and FGF-9 on coronary artery formation, the total number of small, medium, and large vessels was counted using H&E and Masson's trichome staining (See, e.g., FIG. 7A showing Masson staining in db/db mice following sham-MI (panel a), MI (panel b), MI+iPS cell treatment (panel c), and MI+FGF-9 treatment (panel d). The total number of vessels in the transplanted iPS cell and FGF-9 groups were compared with MI in both C57BL/6J and db/db mice following MI. The histogram in FIG. 7B shows a significant increase in the number of vessels in the MI+iPS cells group and the MI+FGF-9 group as compared to the MI group (* p<0.05). An increase in vessel formation following iPS cell or FGF-9 transplantation was confirmed. (X9=FGF-9). FIG. 7C shows staining for smooth muscle (anti-alpha-actin antibody) in C57BL/6J mice following MI (panel a). FIG. 7C also shows TUNEL staining in panel b and DAPI staining in panel c. The merged images of shown in panel d. The histogram in FIG. 7D shows a significant decrease in the % of apoptosis in the vessels in the both the C57BL/6J and db/db mice following MI and treatment with either iPS cells or FGF-9 (* p<0.05 compared to the MI group). Moreover, FIG. 7E shows staining for endothelial cells (anti-CD31 antibody) in C57BL/6J mice following MI (panel a). FIG. 7E also shows TUNEL staining in panel b and DAPI staining in panel c. The merged images of shown in panel d. The histogram in FIG. 7F shows a significant decrease in the % of apoptosis in the capillaries in the both the C57BL/6J and db/db mice following MI and treatment with either iPS cells or FGF-9 (* p<0.05 compared to the MI group). h. Effects of Treatment with iPS Cells and iPS Cells with FGF-9 on Cell Differentiation FIG. 8A shows the percentage of total stem cells positively stained for vWF8 and the total number of smooth muscle cells positively stained for vWF8 in the iPS cell-treated group, the iPS cell-treated group with FGF-9 (25 nanograms), and the iPS-cell treated group with FGF-9 (50 nanograms). FIG. 8b shows the percentage of total stem cells positively stained for CD21 and the total number of smooth muscle cells positively stained for CD21 in the iPS cell-treated group, the iPS cell-treated group with FGF-9 (25 nanograms), and the iPS-cell treated group with FGF-9 (50 nanograms). i. Effects of FGF-9 on MIR-126 Expression Following MI, there is a significant decrease in cardiac neovascularization. The data presented herein show that this decrease is blunted following FGF-9 treatment. Furthermore, the data presented herein indicate that levels of miR-126 expression significantly decreased following MI and this decrease was modulated following FGF-9 treatment. The histogram in FIG. 9 shows a decrease in miR-126 levels in the MI group as compared to sham control. This decrease in the MI group was reversed following FGF-9 treatment. (*p<0.05 v. sham and #p<0.05 v. MI). These data indicate that miR-126 is involved in FGF-9 mediated neovascularization. j. Echocardiographic Evidence of Improvement in LV Function M-mode echocardiography was used as previously reported to determine the effect of iPS cells and FGF-9 transplantation on LV size and function in C57BL/6 and db/db mice 2 weeks following MI. FIG. 10 shows that iPS cell and FGF-9 treatment blunted post-MI remodeling and improved cardiac function two weeks following MI. FIG. 10A shows the fractional shortening (FS) for the iPS cells or FGF-9 treatment groups were significantly different from the MI group. (*p<0.05). FIG. 10B shows the ES for the iPS cells or FGF-9 treatment groups were significantly different from the MI group. (*p<0.05). (X9=FGF-9). k. Avoidance of Teratoma Formation Both human and mouse ES cells form complex teratomas when engrafted into an immune deficient host, which is a characteristic of ES cells resulting from their pluripotential capacity (Damjanov 2004; Thomson et al., 1998). Teratoma formation has been considered a major potential limitation in the therapeutic use of ES cells especially when the transplanted undifferentiated number of cells is higher than 100,000 (Nussbaum et al., 2007). A recent study suggests that intramyocardial transplantation of 1×106 ES or iPS (generated from fibroblasts) cells in the mouse heart causes teratomas (Nelson et al., 2009; Nussbaum et al., 2007). In contrast, no teratoma formation was observed with transplantation of 300,000 cells (Bhfar et al., 2002). The transplantation of 3×104 undifferentiated ES cells did not result in the formation of teratomas after 2 (Singla et al., 2006) and 4 weeks. Importantly, generated iPS cells from various cell sources might have varied in their epigenetic alterations; therefore formation of teratomas may vary. No teratoma formation was observed in the infarcted heart following H9c2 cell-induced iPS cell transplantation (5×104 undifferentiated iPS cells) (Singla et al., 2011). Noticeably, the number of transplanted iPS cells was dramatically less compared with the studies reporting teratoma formation (i.e., range varies from 100,000 to one million undifferentiated ES or iPS cells) (Nussbaum et al., 2007). l. Examination of Immunogenicity of iPS Cells iPS cells from various sources may vary in their epigenetic alterations (Kim et al., 2010). One study suggested that iPS cells generated from fibroblasts using retroviral and episomal approaches are immunogenic in nature (Zhao et al., 2011). However, generated iPS cells by the episomal approach were less immunogenic compared with the cells generated by the retroviral approach (Zhao et al., 2011). iPS cells generated from H9c2 cells using plasmid transfection were used herein, but the immunogenicity of these cells is not well understood. Importantly, the method, the number of cells, and the location of injections described herein differ from recent reports on the immunogenicity of iPS cells (Zhao et al., 2011). Moreover, ES cells transplanted in the sheep heart were compared with and without the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A, suggesting there was engraftment and cardiac regeneration in both groups (Menard et al., 2005). 2. Determination of Whether Transplanted FGF-9 Primed iPS Cells Attenuate Vascular Cell Apoptosis and Enhance Neovascular Repair and Regeneration Following MI Diabetes mellitus (Type II) combined with MI leads to severe cardiac and vascular remodeling, which is a complex, dynamic, and time-dependent process (Glass et al., 2010; Abel 2005; Amos et al., 1997). Recently, neovascularization has been achieved in MI with transplanted endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) isolated from peripheral blood as well as adult and ES cell sources (Jujo et al., 2008; Tillmanns et al., 2008; Urbanket et al., 2003). Mobilization of EPCs in pigs, mouse, and rat models of MI demonstrate an increase in capillary density and improved heart function (Jujo et al., 2008; Tillmanns et al., 2008; Urbanket et al., 2003). Next, experimental evidence indicate that in diabetic animals increased blood glucose levels inducing oxidative stress lead to cardiac and vascular apoptosis, hypertrophy, and vascular remodeling (Abel 2005; Urbanek 2005). Angiogenesis abnormalities have been shown to be present in the infarcted non-diabetic and diabetic heart (Fatma et al., 2010; Abel 2005; Urbanek et al., 2005) How much neovascularization can be achieved in the infarcted non-diabetic and diabetic hearts following transplantation of iPS cells primed with pro-angiogeneic factor FGF-9 is unknown (1) Determination of the Effects of FGF-9 Primed iPS Cells on Neovascular Regeneration in Non-Diabetic and Diabetic Mice Following MI These experiments assess the effects of FGF-9 primed iPS cells following transplantation in infarcted myocardium (non-diabetic and diabetic mice) on stem cell survival, engraftment, and differentiation into neovascular cell types. An established mouse myocardial infarction (MI) model (Singla et al., 2006; Singla et al., 2007; Singla et al., 2011) to inject RFP labeled differentiated iPS cells primed with FGF-9 (total of 1×105 cells in two different intramyocardial injections in the peri-infarct zone of the infarcted heart. For example, differentiated iPS, ES cells, fibroblast reprogrammed iPS cells, H9c2 cells, FGF-9 (1 ng/20 μL in two injections or 50 ng/mL, or cell culture medium (as a control) are injected. The subsequent effects on neovascularization are quantified. C57BL/6 and db/db (Jackson Laboratories) mice are used and the mice are separated into groups receiving or not receiving Cyclosporin A. Animals are treated with cyclosporine A (250-300 mg/kg) for 5 days before cell transplantation and are treated with cyclosporine A for 28 days after cell transplantation (see, e.g., Menard et al., 2005; Giralt et al., 1997). Drug dose are increased or decreased based on average cyclosporine serum concentration of 300-400 ng/L (Menard et al., 2005; Giralt et al., 1997). Moreover, before and after MI, db/db mice are regularly monitored for glucose and given insulin injection (0.75 U/kg i.p. as reported (Kobayashi et al., 2008) if glucose levels exceed 350±25 mg/dL to eliminate the variation of observed differences due to glucose levels. Animals are killed humanely at short-term (72 hrs and 14 days) and long-term (3, 6, 12, and 16 weeks) for histological, immunohistochemistry, and physiological (blood flow) analysis. FGF-9 primed-iPS cells are treated as follows. FGF-9 (50 ng/mL) is added to the iPS cells in the differentiation medium (a medium that does not contain iPS cell self-renewal growth factors such as activin A, leukemia inhibitory factor and mouse embryonic fibroblast condition medium) for 48 hours. These iPS cells are considered as FGF-9 primed differentiated iPS cells. Control iPS or ES cells are cultured for 48 hrs in a differentiation medium without FGF-9. Infiltration of T-cells is determined using anti-CD3 and anti-CD4 antibodies (Zhao et al., 2011). H&E stained sections are examined to identify the presence of any inflammatory cells. Additionally, heart sections are analyzed to determine the effect of FGF-9-iPS cells on capillary density and formation of coronary arteries. Heart function is examined via echocardiography (Singla et al., 2006; Singla et al., 2011) (2) Determination of Total Number of Transplanted FGF-9 Primed iPS Cells Engraftment Following MI Serial sections containing right ventricular (RV), LV free wall, and interventricular septum are immunostained for RFP (Evrogen, Russia), Oct3/4, or Sox2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to determine early engraftment up to 24 hrs. Cells that stain positive for RFP, but not for Oct3/4 or Sox2 antibody, are considered as non-engrafted iPS cells. Sections are counter-stained with DAPI (Sigma) to delineate the nuclei. Fluorescence microscopy is used to acquire images. NIH image J processing and analysis software are employed for these analyses. (3) Determination of Proliferation of Engrafted Cell Proliferation Following MI To determine the number of engrafted iPS cells that have started EC and VSMC proliferation, BrdU (50 mg/kg body weight, i.p (Beltrami et al., 2003) is administered. BrdU identifies nuclei in S phase in order to label actively dividing cells. Active cell growth of engrafted cells is identified using double-label immunostaining for RFP and BrdU (Dako) antibodies. RFP identifies donor engrafted cells whereas BrdU labels DNA synthesizing cells. Furthermore, to determine how many cells have started cell division and cell types at any given time, double-label immunostaining is performed using a Ki-67 antibody (Dako) and an RFP antibody. Ki-67 is a nuclear antigen, which is associated with cell division and labels proliferating cells (G1-, S-, G2-phase and mitosis), but not in quiescent or resting cells (G0-phase), and as stated above, RFP antibodies identify donor grafted cells. Slides are analyzed using fluorescence (Olympus) and confocal microscopy. Cell stage differentiation is determined Using double or triple-label immunostaining to detect donor cells (RFP antibody) and early, late, and mature differentiated EC cell types using their marker cell specific antibodies, the number of early and mature endothelial cells that form following engraftment at various time points following MI is assessed. If cells stain positive with CD14+ or CD1a+ antibodies and are negative for vWF antibody staining, then these cells are considered early EPCs. If cells stain positively for CD34+ or CD133+ antibodies and are negative for vWF antibody staining, then these cells are considered late EPCs Mature endothelial cells are identified with antibodies such as factor VIII antibody (Sigma), CD31/PECAM-1 (Santa Cruz), and Griffonia simplicifolia lectin (Sigma). Reports state that EPCs have the potential to differentiate into ECs and VSMCs. To confirm that EPCs differentiated from transplanted iPS cells are also positive with both newly formed EC and VSM progenitor cells, sections are immunostained with endothelial and smooth muscle specific markers (e.g., FLK-1/VEGF-R2, CD34, VEcad, and endoglin). Sections are stained with respective FITC or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies and counterstained with DAPI for nuclear visualization. Slides are analyzed using Olympus and confocal microscopy. Western blotting and RT-PCR are be used to determine the SM cell markers such as SM-MHC-11, calponin and SM22 alpha. The early and late EPC marker antibodies are commercially available (Krenning et al., 2008). (4) Identification of Coronary Artery Formation Following MI New cell differentiation and capillary and coronary artery formation are determined using double-label immunostaining to detect donor cells (RFP antibody) and differentiated cell types using neovascular cell specific antibodies. Endothelial cells are identified using cell specific antibodies such as factor VIII antibody (Sigma), CD31/PECAM-1 (Santa Cruz), and Griffonia simplicifolia lectin (sigma). For the identification of smooth muscle cells, α-smooth muscle (SM) actin (Sigma), SM22a, calponin, and SM-myosin heavy chain (MHC)-11 antibodies are used. Sections are stained with respective FITC or rhodamine conjugated secondary antibodies and counterstained with DAPI for nuclear visualization. Slides are analyzed using confocal microscopy. Whether newly formed vessels are functional, and whether the vessels survive long term (or whether the vessels have atrophied or been eliminated due to apoptosis) are examined Immunostaining is performed and the size and number of vessels is determined To distinguish the extent of cell survival versus apoptotic cell death at long term time points, newly formed coronary arteries are identified using a combination of RFP staining, cell specific staining, and TUNEL and caspase-3/Bax antibody. Sections are stained with respective FITC or rhodamine conjugated secondary antibodies and counterstained with DAPI (15 μg/mL for nuclear visualization. Slides are analyzed using Olympus fluorescence and confocal microscopy. Furthermore, animals are treated with rhodamine-labeled dextran to determine whether newly generated coronary vessels are functional and have blood circulation. (Fatma et al., 2010; Singla et al., 2006; Singla et al., 2008; Singla et al., 2011 (Mol. Pharm); Singla et al., 2011 (Am. J. Physiol. Heart Cir. Physiol.). (5) Determination of Regional Blood Flow Following MI To determine if transplanted stem cells give rise to increased blood flow through new vessel formation, the commonly used non-radioactive isotope-labeled microspheres procedure is performed as described in Tillmans et al., 2008). (6) Functional Assessment of the Regenerated Heart Echocardiography is an accurate noninvasive tool for the determination of quantitative characterization of heart remodeling following MI (Singla et al., 2008; Singla et al., 2011 (Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol.). Echocardiography is performed on infarcted hearts at short term post-MI time points (72 hrs and 14 days) and at long-term post-MI time points (3, 6, 12, and 16 weeks). M-mode images in a short axis view are performed to measure LV mass, LV mass to body ratio, LV anterior and posterior wall thickness, and fractional shortening. 3. Determination of Whether FGF-9-iPS-CM Enhances Endogenous Activation of C-Kit+ Flk-1-ve CPCs and FLK1+ve-PCs Following MI Factors released from Akt transfected mesenchymal stem cells inhibit cardiac myocyte apoptosis (Gnecchi et al., 2005; Gnecchi et al., 2006). Some studies indicate that MSCs following transplantation in the infarcted heart restores c-kit positive CSCs niches (Hare 2007) and inhibit apoptosis. CPCs proliferation and differentiation was also activated by intramyocardial injection of HGF and IGF-1 in the infarcted myocardium (Tillmanns et al., 2008; Urbanek et al., 2003). Factors released from ES cells are different than those factors released from adult stem cells and inhibit H9C2 cell apoptosis (Singla et al., 2007; Singla et al., 2008). Following transplantation of ES-CM in the infarcted heart, cardiac myocyte apoptosis was significantly inhibited and function was improved. (Fatma et al., 2010; Singla et al., 2011 (Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol). Following transplantation of ES-CM in the infarcted heart, there was enhanced activation of CPCs and FLK-1+ve-PCs. (Fatma et al., 2010; Singla et al., 2011). The enhanced activation contributed to cardiac neovascular regeneration via improved cardiac function. Moreover, following the intramyocardial injection of FGF-9 in the infarcted heart, there was enhanced neovascularization mediated via c-kit positive cells. (1) Determination of the Effects of Factors Released from iPS Cells on C-Kit+ve CPCs and Flk-1+ve-PC Following Myocardial Infarction Using a cell culture model system (Fatma et al., 2010; Singla et al., 2007; Singla et al., 2008; Singla et al., 2011), iPS-CM is produced from iPS-cells primed with and without FGF-9. Preparation of CM is well reported by us. A mouse myocardial infarction (MI) model (Fatma et al., 2010; Singla et al., 2007; Singla et al., 2008; Singla et al., 2011) is used as well as C57BL/6 and db/db mice with and without cyclosporine A to inject FGF-9-iPS-CM (15× (Fatma et al., 2010; Singla et al., 2011), FGF-9 (1 ng/20 μL in two injections (50 ng/mL) or cell culture medium (as a control) using two intramyocardial injections following MI. Moreover, additional cell specific CM such ES-CM and H9c2-CM are used for comparison purposes. The effects on cardiac neovascularization are quantified. Animals are killed humanely at short time points (72 hrs and 14 days) and long-term time points (3, 6, 12 and 16 weeks) following MI treatment for histological, physiological analysis, and preparation of tissue homogenates. To analyze the effect of iPS-CM, heart sections are prepared for immunostaining to determine CPCs and FLK-1-PCs niches and cell proliferation and differentiation. Echocardiography is used to examine heart function (2) Identification of C-Kit−ve CPCs and Flk-1+ve-PCs and their Proliferation and Cell Division Following transplantation in the infarcted heart, resident CPCs have been identified and the role of these CPCs in neovascular regeneration has been determined. CPCs are lineage negative and are identified with cell specific markers. CPCs specific antibodies such as c-kit, MDR1 and sca-1 (Molecular Probes) are used to identify CPCs. To distinguish whether CPCs are migrated from the bone marrow, sections are stained for markers of hematopoietic cell lineage (such as CD34, Cd8, and CD45 (Molecular Probes, Santa Cruz)). FLK-1 specific antibodies such as CD34 and FLK-1/VEGF-R2 (Santa Cruz) are used to identify FLK-1 cells. The number of CPCs and FLK-1-PCs that have started proliferation and differentiation is determined. (3) Identification of Progenitor Neovascular Cell Types Lineage Using double-label immunostaining to detect CPCs (c-kit, MDR1 and sca-1 antibody) and using cell specific antibodies to detect neovascular specific progenitor cell types such as VSMCs and ECs using (Fatma et al., 2010), cell specific lineage progenitor cells are determined To determine progenitor ECs, sections are immunostained with endothelial specific transcription factors Ets-1, Fli-1, Etv2, and Erg 1 (Sigma, Molecular Probes) and structural protein flk1 (Santa Cruz) antibodies. For progenitor smooth muscle cells, transcription factors GATA 6 and GATA 2 and structural protein α-SM actin antibodies (Sigma) are used. Sections will then be stained with respective FITC or rhodamine conjugated secondary antibodies and counterstained with DAPI for nuclear visualization. Slides are analyzed using Olympus fluorescence and confocal microscopy. The number of CPCs in the acute and chronic cardiomyopathy is quantified. RT-PCR and western blot is performed to confirm increased levels of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells transcriptional factors and protein levels. 4. Determination of Whether Transplanted FGF-9 Primed iPS Cells or FGF-9-iPS-CM Stimulates Neovascularization Via Activation of MIR-126 Pathway miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs about 20-24 nucleotides in length that play a major role in the regulation of a variety of cell processes including apoptosis, hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac differentiation (Care et al., 2007; Catalucci et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2006; Cimmino et al., 2005). The deletion of miR-126 was reported to demonstrate loss in vascular integrity and defects in ECs proliferation in the mice with and without myocardial infarction (Wang et al., 2008). Furthermore, miR-126 inhibited SPRED1 and PIK3R2, which are both negative regulators of the VEGF signaling pathway (Wang et al., 2008; Heusschen et al., 2010). These studies determine the role of the miR-126 pathway in neovascularization in diabetic infarcted mouse hearts as well as determine the effect of transplanted FGF-9 primed iPS cells or FGF-9-iPS-CM. The presence of decreased neovascularization that leads to decreased cardiac function in the infarcted mouse heart was demonstrated. Next, transplanted iPS cells enhanced neovascularization with improved cardiac function. Moreover, the levels of miR-126 were significantly reduced following MI and this decrease was reversed with cell transplantation. (1) Determination of the Effects of FGF-9-iPS Cells or iPS-CM on MIR-126 Mediated Neovascularization Using RT-PCR, the levels of miR-126 following MI are determined (Glass et al., 2011) and miR-126 levels are confirmed with northern blotting (Dey et al, 2011; Narducci et al., 2011; Small et al., 2010). To determine the role of miR-126 on neovascularization, animals are injected with a selective inhibitor of miR-126 (locked nucleic acid, LNA-antagomir-126, 80 mg/kg, as this dose is used by other investigators (Hartley et al., 2010; Patrick et al., 2010). To identify expression of miR-126 in the infarcted, non-infarcted, and peri-infarcted region of the heart following MI, heart sections are stained using in situ-hybridization for miR-126. In situ-hybridization employing LNA-miR-126 specific probes (Exiqon) (Hosada et al., 2011) is utilized. Additionally, expression of miR-126 in major heart cell types is characterized using double label immunostaining with cell specific antibodies. In brief, after in situ hybridization, sections are co-labeled with neovascular cell specific antibodies such as CD31 for endothelial cells and smooth muscle α-actin for VSM cells. Sections are counter stained with DAPI to identify cell nuclei. To determine the effects of miR-126 on downstream targeted protein SPREAD1 and PIK3R2, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses are performed to determine the protein expression of total and phosphorylated SPRED1 and PIK3R2 (Abcam, USA). Densitometry is used to measure band density.
