patent rorni TITLE Primarily used to help blind or partially impaired people. Once a food or drink item has been opened the product will enable tire person or persons to identity and indicate the number on days a food or drink product may be consumed. WRITTEN DESCRIPTION Were the present invention proposes a system in foe form of a strip of soft plastic air bubbles applied onto one side of double sided tape, after which the adhesive backing strip is pe^ed off and placed onto food or drink packaging or similar products in a fridge. At present a person blind, partially impaired or reduced sensitivity in the fingers relies basically on smell or touch to order to test how safe a food or drink product is to consume, after the seal on the packaging has been broken. It is neither healthy nor safe to rely on this method and therefore this invention would give dear indication to a person blind, visually impaired or with reduced finger sensitivity when to discard food or drink before tire useful storage lifetime has elapsed. Their are different types of devices cm foe market in the form of raised lettering, Braille or electronic methods are used to identity foe type of food or drink products. For persons impaired with low sensitivity in their fingers or cannot read Braille this does not solve tire problem of informing a person when to discard food or drink past its non consumable state. This is an improvement because it wilt help people with or without Braille experience and or reduced sensitivity in foe fingers to recognize non consumable products. The purpose of this invention will permit identification of non consumable food or drink products, after the seal has been broken. When a person breaks the seal on a perishable item, the adhesive backing is removed and the step of air bubbles are placed onto foe packaging, milk with a normal shelf life of 3 days, to were by a person would pop all of the bubbles on the step apart from 3 allowing the person next day and every other day after to continue to pop one bubble every day, using their fingers or other implement until no more are left, thus indicating the amount of days when to discard the food or drink item safely. STATEMENT OF INVENTION To overcome the, the present invention is a fixable strip of soft popabte plastic air bubbles, although the configuration and content could be changed. Attached on the underside of the soft bubbles is a strip of double sided tape that is attached onto the outside of food or drink packaging placed at relatively low temperatures without de-bonding from the food or drink packaging, An example when placed into a fridge environment the bubbles strip indicator is placed onto a food packaging when opened With the correct amount of bubbles displayed after opening on the side of foe food/drink packaging for that particular item sell-by-date, each bubble represents one day. By using the fingers, feeling or touching the bubbles they can be deflated each day, indicating when to dispose of a non consumable Hem(s) advantages There are no requirements to understand Braille. A person with reduced sensation in the fingers will benefit from this system. Easily used by a blind or partially impaired person. Will work on all age groups, any nationality within a very short period of time. The invention can also be extended to medicines kept in the refrigerator or food items placed outside of the refrigerator such as fruit and cakes. People living on their own often have to open average size food and drink packaging that could not be consumed quickly, the invention solves this problem. i nt$ memoa can ∞ extended omo pet or mmm τοοα products. Ordinarily this invention greatly reduces the amount of sickness or illness, whilst not being able in the normal world to see or smell if the food or drink items that are safe to consume. The production costs are low and because of its light weight, the delivery cost are inexpensive. This could be extended to blind persons with pets or animals, by placing the Long say food left out in eating containers for animals such as cats or dogs would also benefit from this invention. Air bubble indicators are attached to a form by using temperature sensitive,double sided, laminated adhesive tape. Air bubble indicators the double sided tape have a special adhesive lamination capable of with standing low temperatures within a fridge environment. Mr bubble indicators at the end of the famed strips have a tong of flap whatallows easy removal of the adhesive backing.The application tor this system of air bubble indicators can also be made of anti-counterfeit materials by using watermarks or other systems.present invention permits the application by combining a flexible form of plastic with a double pressure sensitive lamination on both sides, placed together under a row of “soft plastic pockets, with ail' or their soft able substances and shall be capable of not de-bonding in a fridge
