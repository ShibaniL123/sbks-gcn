Step 1-6: 3-(5-Amino-2-methylphenyl)-1-methyl-7-((6-methylpyridin-3-yl)amino)-3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one
1-Methyl-3-(2-methyl-5-nitrophenyl)-7-((6-methylpyridin-3-yl)amino)-3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one (215.2 mg, 0.53 mmol) and ammonium chloride (567 mg, 10.6 mmol) were added to a mixed solution of THF/methanol/water (4:2:1, 17.5 mL), then iron powder (296 mg, 5.3 mmol) was added, and stirred at 80Â° C. for 2 hours. When the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered using a celite pad. The filtrate was extracted with dichloromethane and water. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated to obtain the desired compound (189.5 mg, 95.2%) as a pale yellow solid.
