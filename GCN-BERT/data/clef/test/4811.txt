DESCRIPTION 1. Field The present invention relates generally to methods, compounds and compositions for treatment of cancer, e.g. hepatocellular carcionoma (HCC). In some embodiments, the invention relates to the use of small-molecule compounds to inhibit expression of the transcription factor Late SV40 Factor (LSF) for treatment of HCC or other cancer types. 2. Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignant tumor, which develops in the liver. HCC is one of the five most common cancers and the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The incidence of HCC is increasing despite a decrease in overall incidence of all cancers. In the United States, the estimated new cases of HCC for 2008 were 21,370, of which 18,410 were expected to die. There are multiple etiologies, with subcategories displaying distinct gene expression profiles. The prognosis of HCC remains poor. The mean 5-year survival rate is less than 10%. The mortality rate of HCC parallels that of its incidence because HCC is a tumor with rapid growth and early vascular invasion that is resistant to conventional chemotherapy, and only a single systemic therapy (sorafenib) is available for advanced disease, although the survival benefit averages only a few months. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by late stage diagnosis and a poor prognosis for treatment, usually consisting of surgical resection of the tumor and chemotherapy5-7. Currently, the only approved treatment for primary malignancies is sorafenib, a receptor tyrosine kinase and Raf inhibitor originally developed for primary kidney cancer that is also marginally effective against HCC, increasing survival by 2-3 months as a single treatment. The current treatment options for HCC are not optimal, especially following metastasis. Irradiation and chemotherapies have not so far proved to be satisfactory; surgery is the most effective treatment of HCC. However, surgery is only appropriate for patients with small resectable tumors. Only a single, molecularly based drug (Sorafenib), which targets tyrosine kinase receptors and the MEK/ERK pathway, has generated responses in patients as a single therapy. However, increased survival times with this drug are only a few months. As such, it is imperative to discover novel, effective, and targeted therapies for this highly aggressive cancer. The transcription factor LSF, a member of a small family of transcription factors conserved throughout the animal kingdom15 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and cell lines14 LSF activity is tightly controlled as cells progress from quiescence into DNA replication (G0 to S)3, 13 and it is required for efficient progression of cells through the G1/S transition1, 12 Regulation of LSF activity normally occurs via post-translational modifications, with LSF protein levels generally being low and constant. However, LSF protein levels were recently shown to be highly upregulated in tumor cells, particularly in HCC cell lines and HCC patient samples4, 16 These elevated LSF levels were shown to promote oncogenesis in the HCC cells. Based on work performed by others and by the Applicants of this submission, it is believed that there is a correlation between inhibition of LSF and remediation of HCC in a subject. 3.

As used herein, the terms “cancer” and “malignancy” are used interchangeably and refer to a disease or disease state that is characterized by uncontrolled, abnormal growth of cells. Cancer cells can spread locally or through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body. The term ‘cancer’ is also intended to include any disease of an organ or tissue in a subject that is characterized by poorly controlled or uncontrolled multiplication of normal or abnormal cells in that tissue and its effect on the body as a whole. Cancer diseases within the scope of the definition comprise benign neoplasms, dysplasias, hyperplasias as well as neoplasms showing metastatic growth or any other transformations like e.g. leukoplakias which often precede a breakout of cancer. The term cancer also includes metastases which are cancer cells (e.g. a primary tumor, or a metastasis tumor) that have migrated to other locations in the subject to establish new tumors at such locations. A small molecule compound as disclosed herein which “inhibits” cancer metastasis may result in the delayed appearance of secondary tumors, slowed development of primary or secondary tumors, decreased occurrence of secondary tumors, slowed or decreased severity of secondary effects of disease, arrested tumor growth and regression of tumors, among others. In the extreme, complete inhibition of tumor growth is referred to herein as prevention (e.g., virtually complete inhibition, no metastasis if it had not occurred, no further metastasis if there had already been metastasis of a cancer, or virtually complete inhibition of the growth of a primary tumor caused by re-seeding of the tumor by a metastasized cell). As used herein a “cancer cell” refers to a cancerous, pre-cancerous or transformed cell, either in vivo, ex vivo, and in tissue culture, that has spontaneous or induced phenotypic changes that do not necessarily involve the uptake of new genetic material. Although transformation can arise from infection with a transforming virus and incorporation of new genomic nucleic acid, or uptake of exogenous nucleic acid, it can also arise spontaneously or following exposure to a carcinogen, thereby mutating an endogenous gene. Transformation/cancer may be associated with, e.g., morphological changes, immortalization of cells, aberrant growth control, foci formation, anchorage dependence, proliferation, malignancy, contact inhibition and density limitation of growth, growth factor or serum dependence, tumor specific markers levels, invasiveness or tumor growth in suitable animal hosts such as nude mice, and the like, in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo (see also Freshney, Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique (3rd ed. 1994)). As used herein, the terms “cellular LSF activity” and “biological activity of LSF” are used herein interchangeably. Both terms refer to the ability of LSF to regulate cellular processes downstream of LSF, for example, to modulate the expression of genes that are downstream of LSF. In some embodiments, the biological activity of LSF can elicit a stimulatory effect on expression of LSF-downstream genes. In other embodiments, the biological activity of LSF can induce an inhibitory effect on expression of LSF-downstream genes. In yet other embodiments, the biological activity of LSF may be due to interactions with other cellular proteins. As used herein, the term “derivative” refers to a chemical substance related structurally to another, i.e., an “original” substance, which can be referred to as a “parent” compound. A “derivative” can be made from the structurally-related parent compound in one or more steps. The general physical and chemical properties of a derivative are also similar to the parent compound. As used herein, the terms “disorder” and “disease” are used interchangeably and refer to any alteration in the state of the body or of some of its organs, interrupting or disturbing the performance of the functions and/or causing symptoms such as discomfort, dysfunction, distress, or even death to the person afflicted or those in contact with the person. A disease or disorder can also relate to distemper, ailing, ailment, malady, disorder, sickness, illness, complaint, indisposition, affection. In some embodiments, the disorder or disease is cancer. In some embodiments, the disease or disorder is liver cancer, e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In some embodiments, the disease or disorder is a cancer selected from the group selected from: colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, endometrium cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, bone cancer, kidney cancer, leukemia, large intestine cancer, lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma (SSLC), stomach cancer and other cancers. As used herein, “efficacy” of a therapeutic agent refers to the relationship between a minimum effective dose and an extent of toxic side effects. Efficacy of an agent is increased if a therapeutic end point can be achieved by administration of a lower dose or a shorter dosage regimen. If toxicity can be decreased, a therapeutic agent can be administered on a longer dosage regimen or even chronically with greater patient compliance and improved quality of life. Further, decreased toxicity of an agent enables the practitioner to increase the dosage to achieve the therapeutic endpoint sooner, or to achieve a higher therapeutic endpoint. For example, development of a cancer tumor can be evaluated by the quantitative measurement of tumor growth in terms of doubling or quadrupling tumor volume after a certain period of time. “Efficacy” of a therapeutic agent, for this example, can be determined with reference to the amount of time it takes for the tumor to double or quadruple in size in treated animals (an average number of days for doubling or quadrupling tumor size) compared to untreated animals (control). As used herein the term “effective amount” refers to the amount of at least one therapeutic agent (e.g. small molecule compound) or pharmaceutical composition (e.g. a formulation) that can be administered to reduce or stop at least one symptom of the abnormal proliferation, for example a symptom of a cancer or malignancy. For example, an effective amount using the methods as disclosed herein may be considered as the amount sufficient to reduce a symptom of the abnormal proliferation, for example at least one symptom of a cancer (e.g. HCC) or malignancy by at least 10%. An effective amount as used herein may also include an amount sufficient to prevent or delay the development of a symptom of the disease, alter the course of a symptom disease (for example but not limited to, slow the progression of a symptom of the disease), or reverse a symptom of the disease. Accordingly, the term “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” refers to the amount of therapeutic agent (e.g. at least one small molecule compound of structural formula (I) to (X) as disclosed herein) of pharmaceutical composition to alleviate at least some of the symptoms of cancer e.g. HCC. Stated another way, “therapeutically effective amount” of a small molecule compound as disclosed herein is the amount of compound that exerts a beneficial effect on, for example, cancer, e.g., HCC in a subject to which the compound is administered. Beneficial effects may include inhibition or delay of cancer, e.g., HCC progression. The dosage administered, as single or multiple doses, to an individual will vary depending upon a variety of factors, including pharmacokinetic properties of a small molecule compound, the route of administration, conditions and characteristics (sex, age, body weight, health, size) of subjects, extent of symptoms, concurrent treatments, frequency of treatment and the effect desired. As used herein the term “enantiomer” refers to a pair of molecular isomers which are mirror images of each other and non-superimposable. Enantiomers can differ from each other with respect to their interaction with plane-polarized light and with respect to biological activity. As used herein, the term “expression” refers to the amount of the protein obtained by translation of RNA transcribed from a gene, and/or the amount of RNA transcribed from a gene. As used herein, “halogen” means fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. As used herein, the term “heteroaryl,” refers to an aromatic heterocyclic ring that comprises 1, 2, 3 or 4 heteroatoms selected, independently of the others, from nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen. As used herein, the “heteroaryl” group may be substituted or unsubstituted. A heteroaryl may be fused to one or two rings, such as a cycloalkyl, an aryl, or a heteroaryl ring. The point of attachment of a heteroaryl to a molecule may be on the heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl or aryl ring, and the heteroaryl group may be attached through carbon or a heteroatom. Examples of heteroaryl groups include imidazolyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, quinolyl, isoquinolinyl, indazolyl, benzoxazolyl, benzisooxazolyl, benzofuryl, benzothiazolyl, indolizinyl, imidazopyridinyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, oxazolyl, tetrazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzoisothiazolyl, benzothiadiazolyl, benzoxadiazolyl, indolyl, tetrahydroindolyl, azaindolyl, imidazopyridyl, quinazolinyl, purinyl, pyrrolo[2,3]pyrimidyl, pyrazolo[3,4]pyrimidyl or benzo(b)thienyl, each of which can be optionally substituted. As used herein, the term “heterocyclic ring” refers to any cyclic molecular structure comprising atoms of at least two different elements in the ring or rings. Additional reference is made to: Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1997 as evidence that heterocyclic ring is a term well-established in field of organic chemistry. As used herein, the term “hydroxyl” refers to an —OH group. As used herein, the term “HIV” refers to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. As used herein, the phrase “level of LSF” as used herein encompasses the expression and/or biological activity of LSF. As used herein, the term “LSF” is short for late SV40 factor or late Simian Virus 40 factor, and is also known as aliases LBP-1 (leader binding protein-1), LBP-1c, LBP-1d, SEF (SAA3 enhancer factor), TFCP2 (transcription factor CP2) and CP2. LSF regulates diverse cellular and viral promoters. For the purposes of this disclosure, the term “LSF” refers to a transcription factor encoded by the gene TFCP2. LSF is a DNA-binding transcription factor that is required in multiple cell types for cell cycle progression. It binds to the alpha-globin promoter and activates transcription of the alpha-globin gene. It has been reported that LSF facilitates entry into G1/S phase of the cell cycle, promotes DNA synthesis, and functions as an antiapoptotic factor. As used herein, the phrase “level of LSF” encompasses the expression and/or biological activity of LSF. The terms “lower”, “reduced”, “reduction” or “decrease”, “down-regulate” or “inhibit” are all used herein generally to mean a decrease by a statistically significant amount. However, for avoidance of doubt, “lower”, “reduced”, “reduction” or “decrease” or “inhibit” means a decrease by at least 10% as compared to a reference level, for example a decrease by at least about 20%, or at least about 30%, or at least about 40%, or at least about 50%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 90% or up to and including a 100% decrease (i.e. absent level as compared to a reference sample), or any decrease between 10-100% as compared to a reference level. When “decrease” or “inhibition” is used in the context of the level of expression or activity of a gene or a protein, e.g. LSF, it refers to a reduction in protein or nucleic acid level or activity in a cell, a cell extract, or a cell supernatant. For example, such a decrease may be due to reduced RNA stability, transcription, or translation, increased protein degradation, or RNA interference. In some embodiments, the small-molecule LSF inhibitors as disclosed herein decrease the activity or expression of LSF. Preferably, this decrease is at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 25%, at least about 50%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, or even at least about 90% of the level of expression or activity under control conditions. The term “level” as used herein in reference to LSF refers to expression or activity of LSF. As used herein, the term “inhibit LSF” as used herein refers to inhibiting expression (level) of LSF and/or biological activity of LSF. In some embodiments, the term “inhibit LSF” refers to a decrease in the protein level of LSF and/or gene transcript level of LSF. For example, inhibition of LSF can result in a reduction in the gene expression of TFCP2 encoding LSF. The term “inhibit LSF” also refers to a down-regulation or an inhibition of biological activity of LSF, e.g. the function of LSF to modulate expression of LSF-regulated downstream genes such as genes such as thymidylate synthase (TYMS)1, secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1)4, the complement factor H (CFH) and fibronectin 1 (FN1)11. As used herein the terms “inhibitors of LSF” and “LSF inhibitors” are used interchangeably and generally refer to agents that inhibit LSF. Said agents can be of synthetic or biological origins. They can be organic, or inorganic molecules, or peptides, antibodies or antisense RNA that inhibit LSF. Small molecule compounds disclosed herein can inhibit expression of LSF and/or biological activity (level) of LSF (e.g. Compounds of structural formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X). In some embodiments, the LSF inhibitors are isolated enantiomers of the compounds. In some embodiments, the LSF inhibitors are prodrugs, derivatives and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used herein, a “metastatic” cell refers to a cell that has a potential for metastasis and, when used in a method of the invention, is able to seed a tumor or a cell colony of interest. A “highly metastatic” cell, as used herein, refers to a cell that has a high potential for metastasis; e.g., cells from a cell line such as, but not limited to LM2, MDA-MB-231, PC-3, DU-145, Lewis Lung carcinoma, as described herein, can be considered to be highly metastatic cells. Metastatic cells can be generated in a variety of ways, which are discussed further below.

General It is to be understood that the discussion set forth below in this “General” section can pertain to some, or to all, of the various embodiments of the invention described herein. Late SV40 Factor (LSF) LSF is a DNA-binding transcription factor that is required in multiple cell types for cell cycle progression. LSF binds to the alpha-globin promoter and activates transcription of the alpha-globin gene. It has been reported that LSF facilitates entry into G1/S phase of the cell cycle, promotes DNA synthesis, and functions as an antiapoptotic factor1. LSF also regulates erythroid gene expression, plays a role in the transcriptional switch of globin gene promoters, and activates many other cellular and viral gene promoters. The gene product interacts with certain inflammatory response factors, and polymorphisms of this gene can be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A major cellular target of LSF is the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene (TYMS), which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of dTTP, required for DNA synthesis1. TS has been a long-standing chemotherapeutic target for cancer treatments, and recently it was discussed that elevated levels of LSF in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines can contribute to chemoresistance to one commonly utilized thymidylate synthetase inhibitor, 5-fluorouracil.4 Inhibition of LSF abrogates TS induction, induces either arrest at the G1/S transition, or in apoptosis after entry into S phase. Thus, LSF plays an important role in DNA synthesis and cell survival. In the liver, LSF is activated by inflammatory cytokines and regulates the expression of acute phase proteins8,9. Inhibitors of LSF The ability of a compound to inhibit LSF can be assessed by measuring a decrease in expression or activity (level) of LSF as compared to the level of LSF in the absence of inhibitors of LSF. In some embodiments, the ability of a compound to inhibit LSF can be assessed by measuring a decrease in the biological activity, e.g., transcriptional activity of LSF as compared to the level of transcriptional activity of LSF in the absence of inhibitors of LSF. The expression of LSF includes the amount of RNA transcribed from a gene, e.g. TFCP2 that encodes LSF, and/or the amount of LSF proteins that is obtained by translation of RNA transcribed from a gene, e.g. TFCP2. For example, a LSF inhibitor can inhibit expression of LSF by at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, 95%, 99% or even 100%, as compared to a reference level in the absence of a LSF inhibitor. Additionally, ability of a compound to inhibit LSF can be also assessed by measuring a decrease in or an inhibition of biological activity of LSF as compared to a negative control, e.g. the experimental condition in the absence of LSF inhibitors. The biological activity of LSF can refer to the ability of LSF to modulate expression of LSF-targeted genes such as thymidylate synthase (TYMS) and/or LSF-downstream genes, such as secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), complement factor H (CFH) and other tumor-associated genes (see Yoo et al., PNAS, 2010, 107; 8357-8362, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). Accordingly, a LSF inhibitor can inhibit biological activity of LSF, such as a decrease in expression of SPP1 that encodes osteopontin (OPN, also known as secreted phosphoprotein 1, SPP1), by at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, 95%, 99% or even 100%, as compared to a reference level in the absence of a LSF inhibitor. In some embodiments, the ability of a compound to inhibit LSF is assessed by inhibition of LSF-induced tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer cells, e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro or in an in vivo animal model as demonstrated in the Examples herein, as compared to a reference condition without treatment with such a LSF inhibitor. In such embodiments, a LSF inhibitor can decrease a tumor weight and volume by at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, 95%, 99% or even 100%, as compared to no treatment with a LSF inhibitor. The present invention relates in part to small molecule compounds as well as related compositions and methods directed to LSF inhibitors. In some embodiments, small molecule inhibitors of LSF, as disclosed herein, can be used to inhibit the cellular LSF activity. In some embodiments, LSF inhibitors as disclosed herein can decrease expression (level) of LSF. One of the major targets of LSF is thymidylate synthase (TS) gene (TYMS), which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of dTTP, required for DNA synthesis1. Additional examples of LSF-downstream genes are disclosed in Yoo et al, PNAS, 2010, 107; 8357-8362, and include without limitation SPP1 (encoding osetopontin), complement factor H (CFH), TSPAN8, S100A10, CDH17, EFNB2, ZEB1, REG1A, REG3A, SAA4, TAGLN, FGFR2, EGFR, CYP2B7P1, CYP2B6, GPX2, DPYD, PKLR, LEF1, ICAM2 and IGFBP7. In some embodiments, the genes downstream of LSF are tumor-associated genes, such as relating to invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell growth, drug metabolism, senescence, cell adhesion, glycolysis, Wnt signaling, growth and regeneration, inflammatory response, e.g. acute phase proteins, and modulators of matrix-degrading enzymes e.g. MMP9. In various embodiments, LSF is a transcription factor encoded by TFCP2. Thus, inhibiting LSF can disrupt or inhibit LSF binding to DNA and/or interaction of LSF with other proteins to form a complex. Accordingly, in some embodiments, inhibition of cellular LSF activity can be determined by measuring the level of downstream genes regulated by the transcription factor LSF. The effect of LSF on expression (level) of LSF-targeted or LSF-downstream genes can be stimulatory or inhibitory. For example, one gene induced by LSF is SPP1 encoding OPN. Thus, an inhibition of biological activity of LSF results in a decrease in level of SPP1 mRNA and/or a decrease in the amount of the respective encoded protein, OPN. In another embodiment, one gene inhibited downstream of LSF is TAGLN. Thus, an inhibition of biological activity of LSF leads to an increase in level of TAGLN mRNA. In some embodiments, the cellular activity of LSF can be measured by a reduction in the level of TS. In further embodiments, inhibition of LSF can decrease expression of LSF, for example, a reduction in protein level, and/or a decrease in gene transcript level (e.g. mRNA) of LSF. One aspect of the present invention provides methods of identifying inhibitors of LSF, for example, by the method comprising measuring the LSF activity in a LSF-dependent luciferase reporter assay as described in Yoo et al.4. As disclosed herein, inhibitors of LSF can decrease functional transcriptional activity or the expression of LSF (e.g., such as protein level of LSF, and/or gene transcript level of LSF), by at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, 95%, 99% or even 100%, as compared to the expression in the absence of inhibitors of LSF. The expression of LSF can be measured by standard methods known to an skilled artisan such as western blot, ELISA, and quantitative PCR as well as the methods provided in the Examples section below. In some embodiments, inhibitors of LSF as disclosed herein can inhibit or decrease cellular LSF activity by at least about 10%, relative to the activity level in the absence of inhibitors of LSF, e.g., at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, 95%, 99% or even 100%. In some embodiments, small molecule inhibitors of LSF can decrease expression of downstream genes up-regulated by LSF, e.g. SPP1 encoding OPN, by about at least 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, 95%, 99% or even 100%, as compared to the expression in the absence of inhibitors of LSF. In alternative embodiments, inhibitors of LSF can increase expression of downstream genes down-regulated by LSF, e.g. TAGLN, by about at least 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, 95%, 99% or even 100%, as compared to the expression in the absence of inhibitors of LSF. Examples of such small molecule LSF inhibitors include compounds of structural formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XVI, XVII, XVIII and XXX (as defined herein). A Link Between LSF and Cancer A recent publication has demonstrated a link between LSF and cancer (particularly HCC)4. Indeed, the authors claim that LSF has a regulatory role in cancer (and HCC in particular) and inhibition of LSF is a viable target for therapeutic intervention. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of LSF may be effective as prophylactic or therapeutic agents. Consequently, small molecule LSF inhibitors such as compounds of structural formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XVI, XVII, XVIII and XXX (as defined herein) are possible prophylactic or therapeutic agents for treatment of cancer (e.g. HCC) Prodrugs: A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, i.e. an ester, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis to the free carboxylic acid or free hydroxyl. A prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in an organism. The term “prodrug” is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Prodrugs of an active compound may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Some examples of prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a subject, the group cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Some other examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like.

Thus, in some embodiments, this invention also pertains to prodrugs of any of compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XVI, XVII, XVIII and XXX (as defined herein). Assays In some embodiments, this invention also pertains to assays such as cell assays. The cell assays can be performed on cells, cell cultures (or subcultures thereof) or with tissue such as a tumor. The source of the cell(s) or tissue(s) can be from any source. The cell(s) or tissue(s) can be normal or diseased. In some embodiments, the assay is performed to determine whether or not the cell or tissue exists in a disease state or possesses a predisposition to a disease state. Thus, in some embodiments, this invention pertains to an assay method for treating cells (including cells of tissue) comprising contacting the cells with: (i) at least one small molecule compound (e.g. compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI or XXX, as defined herein); (ii) compositions, mixtures or formulations comprising said compounds; (iii) prodrugs of said compounds; or (iv) combination therapies using said compound, compositions or prodrugs. In some embodiments, the cells are sequentially, in either order, or simultaneously contacted with said compounds, compositions, mixtures or formulation, prodrugs or combination therapies. In some embodiments, the cells or tissue(s) may be contacted with various different chemotherapy agents, vitamins, antioxidant supplements and/or neutraceuticals, each at various different concentrations, to thereby determine toxic levels of the various therapeutic agents, vitamins antioxidant supplements, neutraceuticals and/or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cell assay may, for example, be used to confirm a disease state. In some embodiments, the cell assay may, for example, be used to monitor the progression (or not) of a disease state. Additionally, based on the results of the assay, a physician or practitioner may further decide on a treatment regime for the subject or may even customize the treatment regime based on the results of the assay (i.e. personalized medicine). Treatments In some embodiments, the small molecule compounds that are LSF inhibitors can be used to treat a subject. The treatment can be prophylactic or for an active disease. For example, the treatment may involve treatment of a subject having cancerous cells and/or tumors. Thus, this invention can pertain to treating a disease state (such as a tumor) in a subject by administering to said subject: (i) at least one small molecule compound (e.g. compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI or XXX); (ii) compositions, mixtures or formulations comprising said compounds; (iii) prodrugs of said compounds; or (iv) combination therapies using said compound, compositions or prodrugs. The subject may be any subject. For example the subject to be a patient or other subject in a clinical setting. The subject could be a cancer patient. Mixtures and/or formulations for the treatment of subjects may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and any other compounds or formulations deemed suitable. The specific ratios of the various compounds, other therapeutic agents and/or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and their dosing will be determined using methods known to the skilled artisan. In general, a suitable daily dose of a particular formulation (and the individual compounds and agents contained therein) will be that amount which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. However, dosing (of one or more of the compounds and/or agents) can be increased if a beneficial therapeutic effect is observed while toxic effects are avoided. 5.

Reaction was allowed to stir at room temperature for 3 hours and then to it was added 25 mL ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and 25 mL water. Organic layer was then separated and aqueous layer was washed with EtOAc (2×25 mL). Organic layers were combined and washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and collected via filtration. Ethyl acetate solution was then concentrated onto silica gel and purified via column chromatography with eluant 50:50 hexane:EtOAc. Fractions with desired material present as seen by UV were collected and concentrated to give 230 mg desired acrylamide (84% yield). Material was then used without further purification. To an 8 mL microwave reaction tube was added 230 μmol acrylamide (70 mg) and 4 mL trifluoroacetic acid. The reaction was run under microwave conditions at 70° C. and 200 W power for 30 minutes. Vessel was removed from microwave reactor and allowed to cool to room temperature. The crude reaction mixture was then transferred to a 50 mL round bottom flask and placed in an ice bath.

Example 7 Synthesis of 8-(2-ethoxyphenyl)[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]quinolin-6(5H)-thione (Compound III) To a flame-dried 250 mL round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar was added 5 mmol (950 mg) 3-(2-ethoxyphenyl)propiolic acid, 100 mL toluene, and 7.5 mmol (1.5 mL) thionyl chloride. The reaction was heated to 85° C. and allowed to stir at this temp for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting crude material was then azeotroped (2×25 mL toluene) to remove excess thionyl chloride. The resulting material was dried under high vacuum for 2 hours and made into a 1.0 M solution in CH2Cl2. To a 25 mL round bottom flask fitted with stir bar and flame dried under vacuum was added 5 mL CH2Cl2, 1.0 mmol (1 mL, 1.0 M solution in CH2Cl2) acyl chloride (prepared as described above) and 1.1 mmol (151 mg) benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-amine.

Reaction was cooled to room temperature, quenched by addition of 10 mL saturated sodium bicarbonate, extracted with EtOAc (2×10 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Crude material was then dissolved in minimal CH2Cl2 (5 mL) and poured into 20 mL ice cold hexane. N-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-3-(2-ethoxyphenyl)propiolamide precipitated from solution and was isolated via filtration, washed with ice cold diethyl ether (10 mL) and dried under high vacuum for 2 h to yield 309 mg of the desired propargyl amide. The resulting material was used without further purification. To a flame dried 10 mL round bottom flask fitted with stir bar was added 84 mg propargyl amide (0.270 mmol, 1 equiv), 500 uL CH2Cl2, 1 mL trifluoroacetic acid, and 3 mg Pd(OAc)2(0.01 mmol, 0.05 equiv). Reaction was allowed to stir at room temperature 2 hours and then quenched by addition of 10 mL saturated ammonium chloride, extracted with CH2Cl2 (3×10 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, CH2Cl2 isolated via filtration, concentrated onto silica gel and isolated via flash column chromatography over silica gel with 7:3 hexanes:EtOAc as the eluent to yield 8-(2-ethoxyphenyl)-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]quinolin-6(5H)-one. Residual palladium (Pd) was then scavenged by treating with macroporous polystyrene-bound trimercaptotriazine (MP-TMT) resin (15 mg) in 5 mL tetrahydrofuran (THF) for 24 hours at room temperature. Material was then filtered through a pad of celite, and celite washed with CH2Cl2 (2×10 mL). CH2Cl2 solution was then concentrated onto silica gel and purified via a second silica gel column with eluent 7:3 hexanes:EtOAc to give purified 8-(2-ethoxyphenyl)-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]quinolin-6(5H)-one-FQI-2 (65 mg, 232 μmol).

To a flame dried reaction tube fitted with stir bar and kept under argon atmosphere was added 117.7 mg FQI-2 (0.37 mmol), 3 mL toluene and 84 mg lawesson's reagent. The solution was brought to 110° C. and allowed to stir 30 minutes. The reaction was then cooled to room temperature and quenched by the addition of 25 mL water, extracted with CH2Cl2 (2×20 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered through a cotton plug impregnated on silica gel. The recovered material was then purified by column chromatography with eluant 70:30 hexane:EtOAc to give thiocarbonyl product (Compound III). Example 9 Chiral HPLC Separation of FQI-1 to (R)-FQI-1 and (S)-FQI-1 To a 1.5 mL HPLC vial was added 10 mg of FQI-1 and 1 mL of an 8:1:1 mixture of Hexane:Isopropanol:Chloroform. Solution was sonicated for 30 minutes to ensure complete dissolution. An Agilent 1100 Series HPLC fitted with analytical ChiralCel OD column (10μ particle size, 4.6 mm ID, 250 mm length) was primed for 30 minutes with a 20% isopropanol in Hexane mixture at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. After priming, 100 μL of the FQI-1 solution was injected onto the column and allowed to separate. Starting from the 9 minute mark, a number of collections were made from the end of the column into a series of 1.5 mL HPLC vials every 15 seconds (24 vials in all with ˜250 μL collected in each vial). After the 15 minute mark, the vials were diluted to 750 μL with a 20% isopropanol in hexane mixture and analyzed for enantiopurity. All vials containing material with an er of >95:5 were collected and combined. This procedure was repeated 20 times and produced 7 mg of (S)-FQI-1 (retention time of 9.6 minutes, [α]D23=−8.5° (c=0.47, CHCl3) er>99:1) and 10 mg of (R)-FQI1 (retention time of 10.6 minutes, [α]D23=+10.5 (c=0.67, CHCl3) er>99:1).

Comments: In this Example 9 the enantiomers of a racemic mixture were separated. In several of the above synthetic procedures, racemic mixtures are produced (e.g. Compounds VII, VIII, IX and X). In each case, the enantiomers of the racemic mixture can be isolated essentially as described above. In particular (but not by way of limitation), the enantiomers of compound VII (i.e. compounds V and VI) can be isolated, the enantiomers of compound X (i.e. compounds I and II) can be isolated. It should also be appreciated by one of skill in the art that structural formulas provided herein are written according to convention but are meant to exclude alternative equivalent structures that one of skill in the art would appreciate. In particular, the thio-containing compounds (e.g. I, II, and III) can be illustrated in tautomeric forms such as is shown in FIG. 1 (bottom) for compound III. Example 10 LSF-dependent Reporter Assays NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the expression construct pEF1α-LSF, an LSF expression vector1,2; the reporter construct pGL3B-WT4E1b, a firefly luciferase reporter vector driven by LSF3; phRL-TK, a control renilla luciferase reporter vector; and pEFGP, essentially as previously described3. Five hours after transfection, either vehicle (DMSO) or compounds (VI, I and II, IV and V) were added (FIG. 7, FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, respectively), keeping DMSO at 0.5%. Cell extracts were harvested 36 hours post-transfection and firefly and renilla luciferase activities measured via a dual luciferase assay (Promega). Five μl of extract was mixed with 30 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and luminescence measured for 10 seconds using a 20/20n luminometer (Turner Biosystems). Subsequently, 30 μl of Stop & Glo reagent (Promega) was added, and luminescence also measured for 10 seconds. LSF transactivation activity is given as relative luciferase activity, the ratio of firefly to renilla activities, and normalized to the relative luciferase activity in the presence of vehicle alone. Data for this assay are shown in graphically in FIGS. 5-7. Example 11 Mouse Xenograft Assays Subcutaneous xenografts were established into the flanks of athymic nude mice using QGY-7703 cells (5×105) as previously described4. When the tumors reached a volume of ˜200 mm3 (requiring about a week) intraperitoneal injection of Compound VI (2 mg(VI)/kg of total mouse weight) or vehicle (DMSO control) in phosphate-buffered saline was given 5 times once every 3 days over a period of 2 weeks. The animals were followed for another 2 weeks. Tumor volumes obtained for this experiment is illustrated graphically in FIG. 8. 7. References 1 Powell, C. M. H., et al.
