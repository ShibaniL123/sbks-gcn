PRIORITY OF INVENTION This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/728,121 that was filed on Nov. 19, 2012. The entire content of this provisional application is hereby incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist that has been used clinically to treat prolactinomas, Parkinson's disease, and Cushing's disease and has been reported to have positive effects in patients suffering from depression (see Verhelst, J., et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 1999, 84, 2518; Odin, P., et al. Acta Neurologica Scandinavica 2006, 113, 18; Petrossians, P., et al. Neuroendocrinology 2010, 92, 116; Vilar, L., et al. Pituitary 2010, 13, 123; Castillo, V. A., et al. Research in Veterinary Science 2008, 85, 26; Takahashi, H., et al. Clin. Neuropharmacol. 2003, 26, 230; and Chiba, S., et al. Psychopharmacology 2010, 211, 291. Cabergoline is also used clinically to treat patients suffering from male sexual dysfunction, especially those with elevated prolactin levels (see Nickel, M., et al. Int J Impot Res 2006, 19, 104; De Rosa, M., et al. Eur J Endocrinol 1998, 138, 286; and Safarinejad, M. R. Int J Impot Res 2006, 18, 550). An elevated level of prolactin is a known risk factor for sexual dysfunction and cabergoline lowers the level of this hormone by binding to D2 receptors in the pituitary and inhibiting prolactin synthesis (see Zhang, W., et al. Horm Metab Res 2010, 42, 557). Cabergoline is also an agonist at the D4 and 5-HT1A receptors, both of which are believed to play important roles in regulating sexual function both in males and females (see Millan, M. J., et al. Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2002, 303, 791; Kvernmo, T., et al., Clinical Therapeutics 2006, 28, 1065; Newman-Tancredi, A., et al. Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2002, 303, 815; Brioni, J. D., et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 2004, 101, 6758; Guptarak, J., et al. Hormones and Behavior 2010, 58, 290; Ben Zion, I. Z, et al. Mol Psychiatry 2006, 11, 782; and Sukoff Rizzo, S. J., et al. The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology 2009, 12, 1045). Unfortunately, cabergoline is also a potent agonist of the 5-HT2B receptor (with a reported Ki of 1.2 nM) and, like other 5-HT2B agonists such as nor-dexfenfluramine, is known to cause cardiac-valve regurgitation (CVR) in patients. This potentially fatal complication has greatly limited the clinical use of cabergoline, especially in indications requiring high doses of the drug (see Newman-Tancredi, A., et al. Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2002, 303, 815; Rothman, R. B., et al. Circulation 2000, 102, 2836; Roth, B. L. N Engl J Med 2007, 356, 6; and Schade, R, et al. New England Journal of Medicine 2007, 356, 29. In spite of the above reports, there is currently a need for therapeutic agents that have the useful therapeutic properties of cabergoline, but that lack the unwanted effects associated with agonism of the 5-HT2B receptor. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Applicant has identified a series of compounds that have reduced agonist activity at the 5-HT2B receptor. Representative compounds were found to modulate the D2 receptor and/or the D4 receptor. Accordingly, the compounds are useful for treating diseases and conditions wherein the activity of dopamine receptors is implicated (e.g. sexual dysfunction, prolactinomas, Parkinson's disease, and Cushings disease). Accordingly the invention provides a compound of formula I: wherein: R1 is —C(═O)NRaRb, —C(═O)ORc, (C1-C6)alkyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, (C1-C6)alkoxycarbonyl, or (C1-C6)alkanoyloxy, wherein any (C1-C6)alkyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, (C1-C6)alkoxycarbonyl, or (C1-C6)alkanoyloxy can optionally be substituted with one or more halo, hydroxy, (C1-C6)alkoxy, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, (C1-C6)alkoxycarbonyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyloxy, or NRdRe; R2 is H or (C1-C6)alkyl; R3 is methyl; R4 is H, halo, —C(═O)NRhRk, —C(═O)ORc, (C1-C6)alkyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, (C1-C6)alkoxycarbonyl, or (C1-C6)alkanoyloxy, wherein any (C1-C6)alkyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, (C1-C6)alkoxycarbonyl, or (C1-C6)alkanoyloxy can optionally be substituted with one or more halo, hydroxy, (C1-C6)alkoxy, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, (C1-C6)alkoxycarbonyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyloxy, or NRmRn; Ra and Rb are each independently H, (C1-C6)alkyl, —C(═O)NRfRg, or (C1-C6)alkanoyl, wherein any (C1-C6)alkyl or (C1-C6)alkanoyl can optionally be substituted with one or more NRfRg; or Ra and Rb together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring; Rc is H, (C1-C6)alkyl, or aryl; Rd and Re are each independently H or (C1-C6)alkyl; or Rd and Re together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring; and Rf and Rg are each independently H or (C1-C6)alkyl; or Rf and Rg together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring; Rh and Rk are each independently H, (C1-C6)alkyl or (C1-C6)alkanoyl, wherein any (C1-C6)alkyl or (C1-C6)alkanoyl can optionally be substituted with one or more NRfRg; or Rh and Rk together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring; Rm and Rn are each independently H or (C1-C6)alkyl; or Rm and Rn together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring; or a salt thereof.

In one embodiment of the invention the compound is a partial agonist of 5-HT2B. In one embodiment of the invention the compound is not an agonist or a partial agonist of 5-HT2B. In one embodiment of the invention the compound is an antagonist of 5-HT2B. In one embodiment the invention provides compounds that demonstrate less than 10% agonism of 5-HT2B in the functional assay reported by Porter, R. H. P., et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999, 128, 13-20. In one embodiment the invention provides compounds that demonstrate less than 5% agonism of 5-HT2B in the functional assay reported by Porter, R. H. P., et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999, 128, 13-20. Processes for preparing compounds of formula I are provided as further embodiments of the invention and are illustrated by the following procedures in which the meanings of the generic radicals are as given above unless otherwise qualified. Compounds of the invention can be prepared as illustrated in Schemes 1 and 2. In cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic, a salt of a compound of formula I can be useful as an intermediate for isolating or purifying a compound of formula I. Additionally, administration of a compound of formula I as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base salt may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, α-ketoglutarate, and α-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made. The compounds of formula I can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes. Thus, the present compounds may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices. The active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions. For topical administration, the present compounds may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid. Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers. Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user. Examples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the compounds of formula I to the skin are known to the art; for example, see Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508). Useful dosages of the compounds of formula I can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949. The amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye. Compounds of the invention can also be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents, for example, other agents that are useful for the treatment of depression. Examples of such agents include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as for example, citalopram, dapoxetine, escitalopran, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, indalpine, paroxetine, sertraline, vilazodone, and zimelidine. The biological activity of representative compounds of the invention can be determined using a number of assays that are known. For example, 5-HT2B functional assays were performed following the procedure reported by Porter, R. H. P., et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999, 128, 13-20. 5-HT2B binding assays were performed following the procedure reported by Choi, D.-S., et al., FEBS Lett. 1994, 352, 393-399, using an agonist radioligand. D2 and D4 functional assays were performed following the method reported by Jensen, N. H., et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 2007, 33, 2303-2312. Results from these assays are shown below. Compound 1 and cabergoline were evaluated in a competitive binding assay at the 5-HT2B receptor against 125I-radiolabeled 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, as well as in a 5-HT2B functional assay using HTRF quantitation of IP 1 accumulation. Compound 1 was not significantly less active at the 5-HT2B receptor than cabergoline. Both compounds were full agonists at the 5-HT2B receptor. Compound 8 demonstrated similar potency as cabergoline and compound 1 in a 5-HT2B radioactive binding assay. A 5-HT2B functional assay showed that the change from a 6-allyl group to a 6-methyl group was not enough to completely eliminate 5-HT2B agonism, as compound 8 is a partial agonist, with an EC50 of 16 nM and a Emax of 38%. Compounds 9 and 15 showed no agonism in 5-HT2B functional assays (n=6), while compound 14 showed minimal to no agonism in these assays (Emax<12% in all cases). All three compounds were potent antagonists against serotonin at the 5-HT2B receptor. These results demonstrated that it is indeed possible to synthesize compounds in which 5-HT2B agonism has been eliminated. Further investigation into 9 revealed that it is a full D4 agonist, a potent but partial D2 agonist (EC50 1.4 nM, Emax50%). The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples. EXAMPLES 1H NMR and 13C NMR Spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 spectrometer. The 1H NMR data are reported as follows: chemical shift in parts per million downfield of tetramethylsilane (TMS), multiplicity (s=singlet, bs=broad singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, quint=quintet and m=multiplet), coupling constant (Hz), and integrated value. The 13C NMR spectra were measured with complete proton decoupling. LC/MS analysis was carried out using a BEH C18 column (2.1 mm×50 mm, 5 urn) on a Waters Acquity UPLC system with a Waters ZQ mass detector. Example 1 Preparation of (5R,8R,10R)-6-Allyl-N-[3-(morpholino)propyl]-N-[(ethylamino)-carbonyl]ergoline-8-carboxamide (1) a. N-(3-morpholinopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide (6) To a stirred solution of ethyl isocyanate (1.035 g, 14.56 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (7.5 mL) at 0° C. was added a solution of 3-morpholinopropylamine (2.017 g, 13.99 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (2.5 mL) dropwise over 15 min. After stirring an additional 15 min., triethylamine (5.0 mL, 35.87 mmol) was added followed by p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (3.06 g, 16.05 mmol) in 3 mL of CH2Cl2 (added over 5 min.). The mixture was heated to a gentle reflux for three hours. After cooling to rt, Na2CO3 (4.0 g, 37.7 mmol) and ice water (40 mL) were added. After stirring for 20 min., the organic layer was removed and the aqueous layer extracted with CH2Cl2 (30 mL). The combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was used without further purification in the next step. b. (5R,8R,10R)-6-Allyl-N-[3-(morpholino)propyl]-N-[(ethylamino)carbonyl]-ergoline-8-carboxamide (1) Cabergolinic acid (2) was synthesized from cabergoline by the method of Wang and coworkers (Wang, Z.-X.; Li, Y.; Kondamreddy, M. et al. US 2007-797510, 2008). Cabergolinic acid (17.0 mg, 0.057 mmol) and N-(3-morpholinopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide (27.8 mg, 0.14 mmol) were stirred in CH2Cl2 (2 mL) and NEt3 (0.020 mL) overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting residue purified by chromatography (20% acetonitrile/water to 100% acetonitrile, C18 column) to yield 8.6 mg white solid (30% yield). Compound 1 could also be synthesized from amide 4 according to the procedure for the synthesis of cabergoline developed by Ashford and coworkers (Ashford, S. W., et al., J. Org. Chem. 2002, 67, 7147-7150). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): 9.28 (bs, 1H), 7.91 (bs, 1H), 7.23-7.13 (m, 2H), 6.93-6.87 (m, 2H), 6.02-5.88 (m, 1H), 5.26 (d, J=17.0 Hz, 1H), 5.19 (d, J=9.8 Hz, 1H), 4.01-3.80 (m, 2H), 3.77-3.65 (m, 4H), 3.58 (dd, J=14.5, 5.9 Hz, 1H), 3.46 (dd, J=14.3, 3.9 Hz, 1H), 3.39-3.25 (m, 4H), 3.19-3.10 (m, 1H), 3.06-2.95 (m, 1H), 2.84-2.66 (m, 2H), 2.65-2.52 (m, 2H), 2.52-2.37 (m, 6H), 1.96-1.72 (m, 3H), 1.19 (t, J=7.3 Hz, 3H). LC/MS calculated for C28H39N5O3+H+, 494.3; observed, 494.3. Example 2 Preparation of (5R,8R,10R)-6-Allyl-N-[3-(morpholino)propyl]ergoline-8-carboxamide (4) Cabergoline (40.0 mg, 0.089 mmol) and 3-morpholinopropylamine (0.400 mL, 2.74 mmol) were stirred under nitrogen in a sealed tube at 65° C. for 6 d.

Example 9 Effects of Cabergoline on Sexual Function in Rats It was determined that the administration of cabergoline to rats had an acute effect that remained throughout the entire expanse of the test, as described herein. Specifically, male rats that were administered cabergoline ejaculated significantly more times than controls and had more intromissions before ejaculation with shorter ejaculation latencies. These results indicated that they were more vigorous copulators; reduced ejaculation latency with fewer intromissions before ejaculation would have indicated that cabergoline was possibility inducing a premature ejaculation state, whereas significantly more intromissions demonstrated that the rats were copulating at a faster rate. Additionally, rats administered cabergoline pursued the females more (hence had more intromissions) and their anticipatory level changes prior to copulation (a measure of their anticipatory desire) increased as well, suggesting that they were more behaviorally aroused in anticipation of sex. This correlates with the observation that the rats receiving cabergoline did not object to the gavage, in comparison with the controls, which objected to the gavage with typical vehemence (squealing, trying to kick the tube as is was inserted, etc.). The cabergoline rats may have found the sex more pleasurable, and therefore, did not object to the gavage. This can be tested by seeing whether it can potentiate the induction of a conditioned partner preference. For example, a study could be performed where rats take the drug immediately before their first sexual experience with an almond scented female and 4 days later the cabergoline rats are put in an open field with two females, one scented and the other unscented. Males given their first, e.g., 10, copulatory experiences with scented females would show a significant conditioned ejaculatory preference to ejaculate preferentially with the scented female. These results would indicate that cabergoline is embellishing the pleasure or reward induced by intromissions and especially ejaculations and would mean that the drug could be used medically to help men or women with orgasm dysfunction. Cabergoline could also be similarly tested on males that have had their ejaculations reduced to near zero by chronic administration of the SSRI fluoxetine. SSRIs are known to induce anorgasmia, and currently there is no treatment for this side effect. Thus, these studies suggest cabergoline may be used to treat sexual dysfunction (e.g., orgasm dysfunction, including, e.g., anorgasmia induced by SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine)).
