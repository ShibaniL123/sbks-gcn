Step 6. tert-Butyl 5-(4-(2-chloroacetamido)-2-(difluoromethoxy)-6-fluorophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate
To a solution of tert-butyl 5-(4-amino-2-(difluoromethoxy)-6-fluorophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate (188 mg, 0.396 mmol) and 2-chloroacetic acid (37 mg, 0.39 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (3 mL) were added N,N-diisopropylethylamine (138 Î¼L, 0.79 mmol) and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)uronium hexafluorophosphate (226 mg, 0.59 mmol). After stirring at r.t. for 2 h, water was added and the precipitated product was collected by filtration, dried and was used in the next step without further purification (209 mg, 96%).
