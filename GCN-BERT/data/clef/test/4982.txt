Step 13: preparation of intermediate 10-allyloxy-5-(2-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)ethyl)-3-thia-5.8.10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-ene-4,9-dione (3m)
In a sealed flask, to a solution of 10-allyloxy-5-(2-methylsulfonyloxyethyl)-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-ene-4,9-dione (3l) (1.06 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (5.30 mL) was added NaN3 (345 mg, 5.31 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred 18 h at 65°C before concentration in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc and washed with NaCl aqueous solution. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The yellow oil was dissolved in anhydrous THF (3.2 mL) and toluene (3.2 mL) and a solution of PMe3 1 M in THF (1.6 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred 1 h at rt then cooled to 0°C and a solution of Boc-ON (392 mg, 1.6 mmol) in anhydrous THF (2.2 mL) was slowly added. After 1 h at rt, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc 100/0 to 0/100) to afford 10-allyloxy-5-(2-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)ethyl)-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-ene-4,9-dione (3m) (190 mg, 0.50 mmol, 45% over 2 steps) as a off white oil.
