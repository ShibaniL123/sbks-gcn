4-{[(6-Bromo-3,8-dimethyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid
At RT, 1.37 ml (1.37 mmol) of 1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution were added to a solution of 212 mg (0.33 mmol, purity 80%) of the compound from Example 62A in a mixture of 4 ml of THF and 0.8 ml of methanol, and the mixture was stirred under reflux for 1.5 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was adjusted to pH 3 by addition of 0.15 ml (1.95 mmol) TFA and concentrated. The residue was taken up in a mixture of 10 ml of acetonitrile and 2 ml of DMSO and purified by preparative HPLC (column: Kinetix C18, 5 μm, 200 mm×21.5 mm; flow rate: 75 ml/min; detection: 210 nm; injection volume 1.0 ml; temperature: 40° C.; gradient water/acetonitrile/(acetonitrile/water+0.2% formic acid) 45:50:5-5:90:5; run time 11.5 min). This gave 85 mg (51% of theory, purity 100%) of the title compound
