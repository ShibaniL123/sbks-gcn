Step 4: N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-N-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-7-methoxy-6-nitroquinazoline -4-amine
Metallic sodium (113 mg, 5.0 mmol) was added to anhydrous methanol (20 mL), and stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes. N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-N-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-7-fluoro-6-nitroquinazoline-4-amine (2.4 g, 5.0 mmol) was then added, and the resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 40 Â°C for 6 hours. After cooling, the mixture was poured into 100 mL of water, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo to afford the title compound (2.35 g, 94%).
