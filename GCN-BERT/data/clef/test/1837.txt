TWO-PHASE DENTIFRICES BACKGROUND [0001] Soluble zinc salts, such as zinc citrate, have been used in dentifrice compositions, see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,121,315, but may react with common excipients in dentifrice to form insoluble salts and so reduce delivery of the zinc to the tooth surface. For example, many people prefer dentifrice comprising calcium carbonate (chalk) abrasive, but zinc ions will react with calcium carbonate to form insoluble zinc carbonate, thereby reducing the delivery of the zinc to the tooth surface. [0002] Thus, there is a need for compositions which are able to overcome the problems with formulation zinc salts in a calcium carbonate backbone. [0002a] Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which has been included in the present specification is not to be taken as an admission that any or all of these matters form part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present disclosure as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application. [0002b] Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps. SUMMARY [0002c] In a first aspect, there is provided, a toothpaste product comprising a first dentifrice comprising a calcium carbonate abrasive, a second dentifrice comprising a zinc ion source in a gel base, and a container which holds the first dentifrice physically separate from the second dentifrice until the dentifrices are dispensed wherein the amount of first dentifrice relative to the second dentifrice is from 3:1 to 5:1. [0002d] In another aspect, there is provided a striped toothpaste comprising a first dentifrice comprising a calcium carbonate abrasive, second dentifrice comprising a zinc ion source and a silica gel portion, wherein the second dentifrice is entrained as a stripe in the first dentifrice, wherein the zinc ion source is concentrated in the silica gel portion, and wherein the amount of first dentifrice relative to the second dentifrice is from 3:1 to 5:1. [0002℮] In another aspect, there is provided a method of treating or preventing a condition of the oral cavity, comprising administering a composition as described above, to the oral cavity of a subject in need thereof. [0002f] In another aspect, there is provided use of a composition as described above, for treating or preventing a condition of the oral cavity. [0003] Some embodiments of the present invention provide enhanced delivery of Zn++ ions from a zinc ion source such as ΖηΟ and/or Ζη citrate to the tooth surface using a calcium carbonate dentifrice, thus providing enhanced antibacterial efficacy and enhanced protection against erosion and hypersensitivity. The zinc ion source is incorporated in silica dentifrice stripes entrained in a calcium carbonate based dentifrice formulation, providing the benefits and consumer acceptability of a calcium carbonate dentifrice. This formulation provides enhanced delivery of zinc to the tooth surface compared to simply incorporating the zinc into the calcium carbonate dentifrice, and thus enhanced the antibacterial, antisensitivity and antierosion benefits of the zinc. Products comprising the toothpaste and methods of making and using the dentifrice are also provided. [0004] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0005] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. (0006J The invention provides, in one embodiment, formulations to enhance the delivery of Zxffi ions from a zinc ion source, e.g., zinc oxide and/or zinc citrate, onto hard tissue surfaces e.g., hydroxyapatite (HAP), from a calcium carbonate dentifrice, to obtain enhanced antibacterial efficacy. Zinc ions have good antibacterial efficacy compared to conventional chalk-based formulations, but when zinc ions are provided in calcium carbonate formulations, we have found that the delivery of zinc to the tooth surface is relatively poor. In this formulation, a zinc ion source is incorporated In silica gel stripes entrained in a.calcium carbonate based dentifrice. This formulation surprisingly enhances the delivery of zinc ion on hard tissues in the oral cavity, thus providing enhanced antibacterial benefits compared to formulations containing zinc ion sources in a calcium carbonate matrix.
