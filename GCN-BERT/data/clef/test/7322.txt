Iodination Process, Monomer and Polymer Background of the Invention Electronic devices containing active organic materials are attracting increasing attention for use in devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photoresponsive devices (in particular organic photovoltaic devices and organic photosensors), organic transistors and memory array devices. Devices containing active organic materials offer benefits such as low weight, low power consumption and flexibility. Moreover, use of soluble organic materials allows use of solution processing in device manufacture, for example inkjet printing or spin-coating. An OLED has a substrate carrying an anode, a cathode and one or more organic light- emitting layers between the anode and cathode. A light emitting layer may comprise a semiconducting host material and a light- emitting dopant wherein energy is transferred from the host material to the light- emitting dopant. For example, J. Appl. Phys. 65, 3610, 1989 discloses a host material doped with a fluorescent light-emitting dopant (that is, a light-emitting material in which light is emitted via decay of a singlet exciton). Phosphorescent dopants are also known (that is, a light-emitting dopant in which light is emitted via decay of a triplet exciton). Sook etal, J. Mater. Chem., 2011, 21, 14604-14609, discloses formation of hosts DBTi, DBT2 and DBT3 from dibromodibenzothiophene: DST* The preparation of 2,8-diiododibenzothiophene has been described in Journal of Organic Chemistry, 2007, 72, PP6672-6679, Lo et al. in which dibenzothiophene was iodinated directly with iodine, acetic acid, sulfuric acid and periodic acid in chloroform to obtain 2,8-diiododibezonthiophene in 22-50% yield: A similar iodination is described in Organic Letters, 2010, vol. 12, PP2194-2197, Feng et al. which describes the direct iodination of dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran with iodine, acetic acid, sulfuric acid and periodic acid. The corresponding di-iodo compounds were obtained in 31-66% yield. A wide variation in yield is reported for the same reaction in both the prior art documents discussed above. In addition there is the potential for unwanted side reactions to occur, for example, by over or under iodination of the aromatic ring or by iodination at different positions on the aromatic ring. In addition the reaction can also produce unwanted oxidation products via oxidation of the sulphur. On repetition of the prior art processes, the inventor has found the direct iodination process gave only a very small amount of the desired product and poor conversion of the starting material. Furthermore the inventor has found that these processes may require purification by column chromatography which can be difficult to scale up.

Generally, when the compound of formula (IV) comprises a bromo substituent this substituent does not react during the reaction of the compound of formula (IV) with the compound of formula (I) because reaction occurs preferentially at the position of the iodo substituents of the compound of formula (I). This preferential reaction enables the preparation of carbazole substituted compounds, such as carbazole substituted dibenzothiophenes and carbazole substituted dibenzofurans, in which the carbazole is substituted with bromo substituents. The compound of formula (V) maybe used as a monomer in a polymerisation in the case where at least two R3 groups of formula (V) are bromine.

Polymer synthesis The compound of formula (V) may be used to form a conjugated or partially conjugated polymer. One method of forming conjugated or partially conjugated polymers is Suzuki polymerisation, for example as described in WO 00/53656 or US 5777070 which allows formation of C-C bonds between two aromatic or heteroaromatic groups, and so enables formation of polymers having conjugation extending across two or more repeat units. Suzuki polymerisation takes place in the presence of a palladium complex catalyst and a base. As illustrated in Scheme 2, in the Suzuki polymerisation process a monomer for forming repeat units RUi having leaving groups LGi such as boronic acid or boronic ester groups undergoes polymerisation with a monomer for forming repeat units RU2 having leaving groups LG2 such as halogen, sulfonic acid or sulfonic ester to form a carbon-carbon bond between Arylene 1 and Arylene 2: n LGi-RUi-LGi + n LG2-RU2-LG2 -(RUl-PvU2)n- Scheme 2 Exemplary boronic esters have formula (VI): * (VI) wherein R6 in each occurrence is independently a Ci-20 alkyl group, * represents the point of attachment of the boronic ester to an aromatic ring of the monomer, and the two groups R6 may be linked to form a ring. In a preferred embodiment, the two groups R6 are linked to form the pinacol ester of boronic acid: It will be understood by the skilled person that a monomer LG1-RU1-LG1 will not polymerise to form a direct carbon-carbon bond with another monomer LG1-RU1-LG1. A monomer LG2-RU2-LG2 will not polymerise to form a direct carbon-carbon bond with another monomer LG2-RU2-LG2. Preferably, one of LGi and LG2 is bromine or iodine and the other is a boronic acid or boronic ester. This selectivity means that the ordering of repeat units in the polymer backbone can be controlled such that all or substantially all RUi repeat units formed by polymerisation of LG1-RU1-LG1 are adjacent, on both sides, to RU2 repeat units. In the example of Scheme 2 above, an AB copolymer is formed by copolymerisation of two monomers in a 1:1 ratio, however it will be appreciated that more than two or more than two monomers may be used in the polymerisation, and any ratio of monomers may be used. The base may be an organic or inorganic base. Exemplary organic bases include tetra- alkylammonium hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates. Exemplary inorganic bases include metal (for example alkali or alkali earth) hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates. The palladium complex catalyst may be a palladium (o) or palladium (II) compound. Particularly preferred catalysts are tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (o) and palladium (II) acetate mixed with a phosphine. A phosphine may be provided, either as a ligand of the palladium compound catalyst or as a separate compound added to the polymerisation mixture. Exemplary phosphines include triarylphosphines, for example triphenylphosphines wherein each phenyl may independently be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, for example one or more Ci-5 alkyl or Ci-5 alkoxy groups. Particularly preferred are triphenylphospine and tris(ortho-methoxytriphenyl) phospine. A further polymerisation method is Yamamoto polymerisation in which monomers carrying halogen (preferably bromine) leaving groups react in the presence of a nickel catalyst. The polymerisation reaction may take place in a single organic liquid phase in which all components of the reaction mixture are soluble. The reaction may take place in a two- phase aqueous-organic system, in which case a phase transfer agent may be used. The reaction may take place in an emulsion formed by mixing a two-phase aqueous-organic system with an emulsifier. The polymer may be end-capped by addition of an endcapping reactant. Suitable end- capping reactants are aromatic or heteroaromatic materials substituted with only one leaving group. The end-capping reactants may include reactants substituted with a halogen for reaction with a boronic acid or boronic ester group at a polymer chain end, and reactants substituted with a boronic acid or boronic ester for reaction with a halogen at a polymer chain end. Exemplary end-capping reactants are halobenzenes, for example bromobenzene, and phenylboronic acid. End-capping reactants maybe added during or at the end of the polymerisation reaction. Co-polymers Polymers formed by reaction of a monomer of formula (V) are preferably copolymers comprising a repeat unit of formula (Vr) and one or more co-repeat units: (Vr) wherein R1, R3, n, m and X are as described above, and ni in each occurrence is o, 1, 2 or 3.

A composition comprising a polymer comprising a repeat unit of formula (Vr) and a phosphorescent dopant may contain the phosphorescent dopant in an amount in the range of 0.1-50 wt %, optionally 0.5-30 wt %. If the polymer is a copolymer comprising repeat units of formula (Vr) and one or more co-repeat units then repeat units of formula (Vr) may make up 1-99 mol % of the repeat units of the copolymer, optionally 1-50 mol % of the repeat units. Preferably, the polymer is a conjugated polymer wherein repeat units in the polymer backbone are conjugated to one another to form a conjugated backbone. The singlet excited state energy level and / or triplet excited state energy level of the polymer may be controlled by controlling the extent of conjugation of the polymer. The copolymer may be a partially conjugated copolymer. Repeat units may be introduced into the polymer backbone to limit the extent of conjugation along the polymer backbone and increase an excited stated energy level of the polymer. A partially conjugated polymer may comprise repeat units that limit the extent of conjugation across the repeat unit or that completely break conjugation across the repeat unit. Repeat units to limit the extent of conjugation along the polymer backbone may be provided in the polymer in an amount in the range of 1-99 mol %, optionally 1-50 mol %. Substituents may be provided adjacent to one or both linking positions of an arylene co- repeat unit to create steric hindrance with adjacent repeat units, resulting in twisting of the arylene co-repeat unit out of the plane of the adjacent repeat unit.

One preferred class of arylene repeat units is phenylene repeat units, such as phenylene repeat units of formula (X): (X) wherein w in each occurrence is independently o, 1, 2, 3 or 4, optionally 1 or 2; n is 1, 2 or 3; and R? independently in each occurrence is a substituent as described above. If n is 1 then exemplary repeat units of formula (X) include the following: A particularly preferred repeat unit of formula (X) has formula (Xa): (Xa) Substituents R7 of formula (Xa) are adjacent to linking positions of the repeat unit, which may cause steric hindrance between the repeat unit of formula (Xa) and adjacent repeat units, resulting in the repeat unit of formula (Xa) twisting out of plane relative to one or both adjacent repeat units. Exemplary repeat units where n is 2 or 3 include the following: A preferred repeat unit has formula (Xb): (Xb) The two R7 groups of formula (Xb) may cause steric hindrance between the phenyl rings they are bound to, resulting in twisting of the two phenyl rings relative to one another.

The extent of conjugation of repeat units of formula (XI) to aryl or heteroaryl groups of adjacent repeat units in the polymer backbone may be controlled by (a) linking the repeat unit through the 3- and / or 6- positions to limit the extent of conjugation across the repeat unit, and / or (b) substituting the repeat unit with one or more substituents R8 in or more positions adjacent to the linking positions in order to create a twist with the adjacent repeat unit or units, for example a 2,7-linked fluorene carrying a Ci-20 alkyl substituent in one or both of the 3- and 6-positions. The repeat unit of formula (XI) may be a 2,7-linked repeat unit of formula (XIa): (XIa) A relatively high degree of conjugation across the repeat unit of formula (XIa) may be provided in the case where each d = o, or where any substituent R7 is not present at a position adjacent to the linking 2- or 7-positions of formula (XIa).

Direct Iodination Comparative Example Dibenzothiophene was iodinated directly with iodine, acetic acid, sulfuric acid and periodic acid in chloroform to obtain 2,8-diiododibezonthiophene. A sample of the organic phase was analysed by HPLC: crude 2,8-diiododibenzothiophene = 39.41% An HPLC chromatogram of a sample of the reaction mixture from direct iodination is shown in Figure 2. The peak at 5.22 min is starting material, the peaks at 0.98 min, 1.49mm and 2.75mm are polar species coming from oxidised by-product. Peak no. 12 at 5.46 min corresponds to 2,8-diiododibenzothiophene and shows this product represents 39.41% of the crude reaction product. Monomer Synthesis Example A mixture of 2,8-diiododibezothiophene (40.0 g, 9i.7mmol) 3-bromocarbazole (67.7 g, 275.2 mmol), potassium ieri-butoxide (35.3 g, 366.9 mmol), copper iodide (34.9 g, 183.5 mmol) and trans-i,2-diaminocyclohexane (4.4 ml, 36.7 mmol) in 830 ml toluene was degassed with nitrogen for 30 minutes. Mixture was heated to 70째C for 1 hour, then to 90째C for 24 hours. Heating was increased to 95째Cand stirred for 24 hours. Mixture was then cooled down to room temperature and filtered through a silica/florisil짰/celite plug, eluted with toluene. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and adsorbed on isolute짰 and dry loaded on a silica/florisil짰 plug. It was eluted with a mixture of toluene:hexane (1:1). Fractions containing product were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure. Resulting solid was recrystallised once from a mixture of toluene and hexane and five times from a mixture of toluene and methanol. Solid was dried in vacuum oven to yield 4.7 g of compound of formula (Va) as a white solid, 95.18% pure by HPLC.
