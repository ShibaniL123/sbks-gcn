Background of the Invention Patent Literature 1 discloses, in an attempt to improve the bioavailability of the active ingredient, a "pharmaceutical composition with a bioavailability of the active substance which is substantially independent of the gastric pH, for oral administration of active substances with pH-dependent solubilities and a dose number of more than 1 at a pH>5, comprising a plurality of pellets synthesized in each case from a) a core material, b) an optional insulating layer, c) an active substance layer and d) an optional coating, wherein the core material consists of one or more pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid(s) with a water solubility of more than 1 g/250 ml at 20°C., optionally with the addition of binders or other technological adjuvants." However, the reference does not describe pioglitazone and a salt thereof. Patent Literature 1: JP 2005-526738 A Disclosure of the Invention Problems to be Solved by the Invention The present inventors have studied pharmacokinetics of commercially available tablets containing pioglitazone hydrochloride (trade name: ACTOS® TABLETS), and found that a blood drug concentration after administration to a living organism shows interindividual variation. Hence, the present invention aims to provide a preparation comprising pioglitazone or a salt thereof as an active ingredient, which shows improved solubility of pioglitazone and less interindividual variation in blood drug concentration. In addition, the present invention also aims to provide a preparation showing suppressed color change during preservation. Means of Solving the Problems Generally, methods for improving the solubility of a drug include formation of a solid dispersion, atomization of drug, addition of a surfactant and the like. However, the solubility and absorption of pioglitazone and a salt thereof cannot be improved sufficiently by the general methods employed widely for improving solubility. The present inventors have further studied formulation of pioglitazone and a salt thereof, and found that superior effects of improving the solubility of pioglitazone, increasing the maximum drug concentration in blood and the area under the curve [AUC] of plasma concentration, and further, suppressing the interindividual variation in the drug concentration in blood can be afforded by producing a preparation containing a core comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid with water solubility at 20°C of not less than 10 mg/mL and pKa1 (a negative common logarithm of the first acid dissociation constant Ka1) at 25°C of not more than 5, and a coating layer comprising pioglitazone or a salt thereof (particularly preferably, a preparation having a construct constituting the coating layer, which comprises a cellulose derivative as a skeleton and is maintained in an aqueous solvent, wherein pioglitazone or a salt thereof is dissolved in organic acid solution in the construct to afford an aqueous solution). Furthermore, the present inventors have found that the color change of the preparation (particularly color change under preservation conditions) can be suppressed by adding mannitol or trehalose to the coating layer of the preparation. The present inventors have further studied based on these findings and completed the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention relates to (1) a preparation comprising a core comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid with water solubility at 20°C of not less than 10 mg/mL and pKa1 (a negative common logarithm of the first acid dissociation constant Ka1) at 25°C of not more than 5 (to be sometimes referred to simply as "organic acid" in the present specification), and a coating layer comprising pioglitazone or a salt thereof (to be sometimes referred to as "the coated preparation of the present invention" in the present specification);(2) the preparation of the above-mentioned (1), wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid is at least one kind selected from citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid and ascorbic acid;(3) the preparation of the above-mentioned (1), wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid is citric acid;(4) the preparation of the above-mentioned (1), wherein the coating layer comprises mannitol or trehalose;(5) the preparation of the above-mentioned (1), wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid is citric acid crystal;(6) the preparation of the above-mentioned (1), wherein the weight ratio of pioglitazone and the pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid is 1:4 to 1:26;(7) the preparation of the above-mentioned (1), wherein the coating layer comprises cellulose or a cellulose derivative;(8) the preparation of the above-mentioned (7), wherein the cellulose derivative is low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose;(9) the preparation of the above-mentioned (1), having a construct constituting the coating layer, which comprises a cellulose derivative as a skeleton and is maintained in an aqueous solvent;(10) the preparation of the above-mentioned (9), wherein the construct is present for at least 10 min in McIlvaine buffer (pH 3.0, 900 mL) under the conditions of the Paddle Method (50 rpm);(11) the preparation of the above-mentioned (1), wherein a construct constituting the coating layer, which comprises a cellulose derivative as a skeleton and is maintained in an aqueous solvent, wherein pioglitazone or a salt thereof is dissolved in an organic acid solution in the construct to afford an aqueous solution;(12) the preparation of the above-mentioned (1), which shows bioavailability exceeding 75% in a dog; and the like. Effect of the Invention The coated preparation of the present invention can, as compared to conventional preparations containing pioglitazone or a salt thereof as an active ingredient, enhance bioavailability and suppress interindividual variation in absorption by promoting absorption of pioglitazone. To be precise, the coated preparation of the present invention can, as compared to conventional preparations, markedly increase the maximum blood concentration and AUC of pioglitazone after administration, and remarkably decrease the interindividual relative standard deviation (RSD) of AUC. As mentioned above, the coated preparation of the present invention is a superior preparation, since it shows high bioavailability of pioglitazone, a sufficient effect with a low dose, and less interindividual variation in blood drug concentration. In addition, the coated preparation of the present invention containing mannitol or trehalose in a coating layer is a superior preparation, since it shows high bioavailability of pioglitazone, less interindividual variation in blood drug concentration, and suppressed color change (particularly color change under preservation conditions).

The thus-obtained powder mixture was tableted using a rotary tableting machine (KIKUSUI SEISAKUSHO LTD., AQUA08242L2J1) at a tableting pressure of about 17 kN/punch (14x9 mm oblong) to give tablets containing pioglitazone hydrochloride (33.1 mg) and metformin hydrochloride (500 mg) per tablet (weight of one tablet 663 mg). The obtained tablets (3978 g) were fed into a coating apparatus (POWREX CORPORATION, DRIACOATER DRC-500), film coated by spraying at an air supply temperature 90°C, 14 - 21 g/min to give film-coated tablets weighing 683 mg per tablet. The coating solution (1568 g) used was obtained by dispersing or dissolving hypromellose (162 g), macrogol 6000 (32.5 g), talc (32.5 g), titanium oxide (32.5 g) and yellow ferric oxide (0.52 g) in purified water (2340 g). Reference Example 3 The milled granule A (118.0 g) obtained in Reference Example 2 was mixed with crystalline cellulose (7.9 g), carmellose calcium (6.3 g) and magnesium stearate (0.4 g) to give a powder mixture. The thus-obtained powder mixture was tableted using an Auto-graph (Shimadzu Corporation, AG-50 kN) at a tableting pressure of about 14.5 kN/punch (14x9 mm oblong) to give tablets containing pioglitazone hydrochloride (33.1 mg) and metformin hydrochloride (500 mg) per tablet (weight of one tablet 663 mg). Experimental Example 1 ACTOS tablet (45 mg) (trade name) and the capsules of Comparative Example 1 and Example 3 were subjected to a dissolution test according to the Paddle Method (50 rpm) and using McIlvaine buffer adjusted to pH 3.0 as a test solution. The eluate was filtered using a 0.45 µm filter, and the eluted compound A was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (Hitachi, Ltd.). As a result, the elution rate of compound A from the ACTOS tablet and the capsules of Comparative Example 1 and Example 3 after 15 minutes was 22.8%, 61.7% and 98.5%, respectively. It was clarified that citric acid improves the elution rate of compound A, and that, of the capsules of Comparative Example 1 and Example 3 containing almost the same amount of citric acid, the capsule of Example 3 shows remarkably high elution rate. Experimental Example 2 The ACTOS tablet (45 mg) (trade name) and the capsules of Comparative Examples 1 - 3 and Examples 2 - 5 were administered at a dose of 45 mg (amount corresponding to pioglitazone) to beagles fasted from the previous day. After the administration, plasma concentration was measured at 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr and 8 hr later, and plasma area under the curve [AUC (µg•h/mL)] was calculated by the trapezoid formula. Moreover, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of AUC was calculated as an index of variation of interindividual absorption, and AUC increase rate (%) relative to the ACTOS tablet was calculated as an index of absorption-promoting effect. In addition, the bioavailability was calculated by the following formula: Bioavailability%=AUC of oral administration/AUC of intravenous administration×100 The results are shown below. In the Table, AUC shows mean ± SD and "solution" means 0.5M solution of pioglitazone hydrochloride in citric acid.

A comparison of the capsules of Comparative Example 1 and Example 3 containing almost the same amount of citric acid revealed a remarkably higher absorption-promoting effect and smaller RSD of the capsule of Example 3. In addition, the capsules of Examples 2, 4 and 5 containing citric acid, tartaric acid and malic acid, respectively, showed about 2-fold absorption-promoting effect and RSD was also improved. In contrast, the capsule of Comparative Example 3 containing fumaric acid did not show an absorption-promoting effect and high RSD. The capsules of Examples 2 - 5 showed higher bioavailability as compared to the capsules of Comparative Examples 1 - 3. Experimental Example 3 The granules (before filling in capsules) obtained in Comparative Examples 2 and 3, and Examples 2 - 6 were subjected to a dissolution test according to the Paddle Method (50 rpm) and using McIlvaine buffer adjusted to pH 3.0 as a test solution. The eluate was filtered using a 0.45 µm filter, and the eluted compound A was measured by HPLC (Hitachi, Ltd.). As a result, the elution rate of compound A from the granules of Comparative Examples 2 and 3, and Examples 2, 4, 5 and 6 after 15 minutes was 34.3%, 32.4%, 105.2%, 95.5%, 96.9% and 57.7%, respectively. It was clarified that citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid and ascorbic acid improve the elution rate of compound A, and that fumaric acid does not improve the elution rate of compound A. Experimental Example 4 The ACTOS tablet (45 mg) (trade name), the capsule obtained in Example 7 and the tablet obtained in Example 8 were administered at a dose of 45 mg (amount corresponding to pioglitazone) to beagles fasted from the previous day and given an intramuscular injection of pentagastrin (40 µg/kg body weight) 15 minutes before administration and 30 minutes after administration. After the administration, plasma concentration was measured at 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr and 8 hr later, and plasma area under the curve [AUC (µg•h/mL)] was calculated by the trapezoid formula. Moreover, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of AUC was calculated as an index of variation of interindividual absorption, and AUC increase rate (%) relative to the ACTOS tablet was calculated as an index of absorption-promoting effect. In addition, the maximum blood concentration [Cmax (µg/mL)] was also measured. The results are shown below. In the Table, AUC shows mean ± SD. [Table 29]preparationAUC (µg h/mL)RSD (%)absorption-promoting effect(%)Cmax (µg/mL)ACTOS tablet10.186±5.29952.003.050±1.708Example 715.791±2.08913.2+555.271±0.728Example 818.627±1.1656.3+836.451±1.269 As is clear from the Table, the capsule of Example 7 and the tablet of Example 8, containing citric acid, showed a remarkable absorption-promoting effect and remarkably improved RSD in beagles having a decreased gastric pH by a pentagastrin treatment, as compared to the ACTOS tablet. In addition, the capsule of Example 7 and the tablet of Example 8 increased the maximum blood concentration as compared to the ACTOS tablet. Experimental Example 5 The granules obtained in Examples 2, 7 and 12 (before filling in capsule) were placed in 3 glass bottles for each Example, a first one was tightly sealed, a second one with an open cap was sealed in a 33%RH atmosphere desiccator, and a third one with an open cap was sealed in a 44%RH atmosphere desiccator. They were preserved for 2 months in a constant-temperature device at 40°C. The whiteness of the granules in the glass bottles was visually confirmed before and after the preservation. As a result, the granule obtained in Example 2 turned yellow-brown under any preservation conditions, whereas the granules obtained in Example 7 and Example 12 remained white with no color change. Thus, a suppressive effect on preparation color change due to mannitol and trehalose could be confirmed. Experimental Example 6 Actos tablet (45 mg) (trade name) and the capsule of Example 22 were subjected to a dissolution test according to the Paddle Method (50 rpm) and using KCl-HCl buffer (pH 2.0), McIlvaine buffer (pH 2.2), McIlvaine buffer (pH 2.5) and McIlvaine buffer (pH 3.0) as test solutions. The eluate was filtered using a 0.45 µm filter at 15 minutes from the start of the test, and the eluted compound A was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu Corporation). As a result, the elution rate of compound A from the ACTOS tablet after 15 minutes was 95% at pH 2.0, 78% at pH2.2, 53% at pH 2.5 and 39% at pH 3.0, and 87% at pH 2.0, 102% at pH 2.2, 97% at pH 2.5 and 104% at pH 3.0 for Example 22. The capsule of Example 22 showed faster elution rates and higher eluted amounts at pH 2.2, 2.5 and 3.0, as compared to ACTOS tablet. The results confirm that the capsule of the present invention is not easily affected by pH change as compared to ACTOS tablet, and shows improved solubility of pioglitazone. Experimental Example 7 The pioglitazone hydrochloride granule obtained in Example 19 was subjected to a dissolution test according to the Paddle Method (50 rpm) and using McIlvaine buffer (900 mL, pH 3.0) as a test solution. The state of the granule before the dissolution test, and 5, 10 and 60 minutes after the start of the dissolution test was observed with a microscope. The photographs showing the state of granule is shown in Fig. 1 (A and B) and Fig. 2 (A-D). As a result, pioglitazone hydrochloride was almost dissolved in 5 minutes after the start of the test, and 100% dissolved in 10 minutes after the start of the test. However, the construct having, as a skeleton, a cellulose derivative constituting a coating layer was maintained even at 60 minutes after the start of the test (Fig. 2D). Water and air were observed in the membrane of the construct after elution (Fig. 1B). Experimental Example 8 The granules obtained in Comparative Example 4, Comparative Example 5 and Example 23 were subjected to a dissolution test according to the Paddle Method (50 rpm) and using McIlvaine buffer (pH 3.0, 900 mL) as a test solution. The eluate was filtered using a 0.45 µm filter at 5 minutes from the start of the test, and the eluted compound A was measured using a UV visible spectrophotometer. As a result, the elution rate in 5 minutes of compound A from the granules of Comparative Example 4, Comparative Example 5 and Example 23 was 63.3%, 90.7% and 98.6%, respectively. The results have clarified that, even though all granules contain equivalent amounts of anhydrous citric acid crystal and compound A, the granule of the present invention containing low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose in a coating layer shows a high elution rate as compared to the granule free of low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose in a coating layer. Industrial Applicability The coated preparation of the present invention is a superior preparation, since it shows high bioavailability of pioglitazone, a sufficient effect with a low dose, and less interindividual variation in blood drug concentration. In addition, the coated preparation of the present invention containing mannitol or trehalose in a coating layer is a superior preparation, since it shows high bioavailability of pioglitazone, less interindividual variation in blood drug concentration, and suppressed color change (particularly color change under preservation conditions).
