Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an asymmetric hydroxymethylation reaction and more particularly to a production method for an optically active hydroxymethylated compound and a catalyst thereof. Prior Art The reaction between a silicon enolate and formaldehyde under the presence of a Lewis acid is a useful method to synthesize α-hydroxymethyl carbonyl compounds. However, a catalytic asymmetric reaction is extremely difficult to achieve, and examples with high selectivity have not been reported (References 1 to 5).

Problems to be solved by the Invention The present invention presents a catalyst that allows an asymmetric hydroxymethylation reaction to proceed with excellent asymmetric selectivity and a production method for optically active hydroxymethylated compounds using the catalyst. Means to solve the Problems The inventors discovered that a catalytic asymmetrical hydroxymethylation reaction proceeded with excellent stereoselectivity when a combination of chiral ligands (see Reference 3) and a scandium triflate was used. The present invention was completed based on the discovery. A commercially available aqueous formaldehyde solution (formalin) can be used directly to the reaction. The catalytic system of the present invention is not only useful in the synthesis of optically active materials but also can provide an important direction for the development of catalytic asymmetric reactions in aqueous media. That is, the present invention is a method for producing an optically active hydroxymethylated compound, comprising reacting a silicon enolate and formaldehyde, in the presence of a catalyst, in an aqueous solution or a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent, wherein the silicon enolate is represented by the following formula (chemical formula 2): wherein R5 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, R6 is an alkyl group, an alkyl aryl group, or an aryl group, in which R5 and R6 may together form a five or six membered ring comprising carbon atoms and optional hetero atoms, R7 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkyl aryl group or an aryl group and the groups R8, which may be identical or different, are each alkyl groups, and the catalyst is obtained by mixing a ligand or its symmetric isomer and a Lewis acid, wherein the ligand is represented by the following formula (chemical formula 1): wherein R1 and R2, may be identical or different, are hydrogen atoms, alkyl groups or aryl groups, at least one of R1 and R2 contains at least three carbon atoms, R3 and R4, may be identical or different, are hydrogen atoms, alkyl groups containing one to four carbon atoms or alkoxy groups, X1 and X2, may be identical or different, are represented by -OH, -SH or -NHR11, wherein R11 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, and the Lewis acid is represented by MYn, wherein M is Cu, Zn, Fe, Sc or a lanthanoid element, Y is a halogen atom, OAc, OCOCF3, ClO4, SbF6, PF6 or OSO2CF3 and n is 2 or 3. Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 shows a synthetic route for Ligand 1. Figure 2 shows a synthetic route for Ligand 2. Detailed Description of the Invention The catalyst used in the present invention is obtained by mixing a ligand having the following structure (chemical formula 1): and a Lewis acid represented by MYn. R1 and R2 represent hydrogen atoms, alkyl groups or aryl groups, preferably alkyl groups or aryl groups. They may be identical or different, preferably identical. At least one of R1 or R2 needs to be bulky and, more specifically, needs to contain at least three carbon atoms. R3 and R4 represent hydrogen atoms or alkyl or alkoxy groups having one to four carbon atoms but are preferably hydrogen atoms. They may be identical or different, preferably identical. X1 and X2 represent -OH, -SH or -NHR11, preferably -OH, where R11 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group with a hydrogen atom preferred, and the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl groups is 1 to 3. M represents Cu (divalent), Fe (divalent or trivalent), Sc (trivalent) or lanthanoid elements (57La to 71Lu) (trivalent) but preferably represents Sc. n represents an integer corresponding to the valence of M and represents 2 or 3. Y represents a halogen atom, OAc, OCOCF3, ClO4, SbF6, PF6 or OSO2CF3(OTf), preferably OTf. When this ligand and a Lewis acid represented by MYn are mixed in a solvent, a catalyst is formed by coordinating M in the ligand. H2O-DME, H2O-CH3CN, H2O-THF, H2O-1, 4-dioxane, H2O-EtOH, H2O-MeOH, H2O-PrOH, water and the like may be cited as the solvent used. Each concentrations in the solvent is preferably from about 0.01 mole/liter to about 0.1 mole/liter. In the present invention, this catalyst is used in asymmetric hydroxymethylation reactions of formaldehyde and a silicon enolate as described below (chemical formula 3): R5 to R7 are as described below: R5 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, and R6 represents an alkyl groups, an alkyl aryl groups, or an aryl group. However, R5 and R6 may together form a five to six membered ring, the ring may optionally contain a hetero atom the R7 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkyl aryl group, or an aryl group. R8 represents an alkyl group. They may each be identical or different, but the preference is for them to be identical. R8 is preferably an alkyl group containing one to three carbon atoms and most preferably a methyl group. This reaction is conducted in an aqueous solution or a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent. At this point, dimethoxy ethane (DME), tetrehydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile, dioxane, alcohols containing no more than four carbon atoms and the like may be cited as the organic solvent that readily blends with water used in the mixed solvent with water. DME, THF, acetonitrile and dioxane are preferred examples. The mix ratio of an organic solvent and water is not particularly restricted, but the mixture generally contains at least 1% by weight of water and the presence of at least 5% by weight is more preferred. The amount of the aqueous solution or mixed solvent used should be appropriately considered. Ordinarily, however, the use of the amount necessary to dissolve the starting material substances and the catalyst, for example, from two times the weight to fifty times the weight is considered. The HCHO/silicon enolate molar ratio in a reaction solution is from 0.1 to 10, more preferably about 0.5 to 2. In addition, the catalyst is used at from 1% by mole to 50% by mole, more preferably from 5% by mole to 20% by mole in the reaction system. The reaction temperature is ordinarily form -40°C to ambient temperature, more preferably from -20°C to 0°C. The reaction time may be selected appropriately and from 0.5 hours to sixty hours, for example, is selected. An optically active hydroxymethylated compound is formed by this reaction in excellent yield and selectivity. The present invention is illustrated below by using examples, but these are not intended to restrict the scope of the present invention.

The compound (8) was converted to a camphor ester using the acid chloride, an optical resolution process was conducted using re-crystallization (75% yield, diastereomer ratio = >99/<1) and saponified again to obtain an almost optically pure alcohol (7, quant.). The compound (7) was subjected to homo coupling using a palladium catalyst [PdCl2(PhCN)2-TDAE] to yield a pyridine isomer (9) (Chemical formula 5) in 36% yield (diastereomer ratio =>99.5/<0.5).
