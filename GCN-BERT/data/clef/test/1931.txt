Example 51: Synthesis of compound 11236, N-(2-fluoro-4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)-1-isobutyryl-N-phenylazetidine-3-carboxamide
N-(2-fluoro-4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)-N-phenylazetidine-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (0.050 g, 0.109 mmol), synthesized in step 5 of Example 47, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.038 mL, 0.219 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and isobutyryl chloride (0.013 mL, 0.120 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 4 g cartridge; methanol/dichloromethane = from 0% to 20%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.036 g, 67.1%) as a white solid.
