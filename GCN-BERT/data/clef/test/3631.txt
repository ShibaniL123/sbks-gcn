Object of the Invention As expressed in the title of the present specification, the invention relates to a machine for recycling sharp, pointed objects which provides innovative features and advantages for its intended function, which features and advantages will be described below and entail a significant novelty in the current state of the art. More particularly, the object of the invention is centered on a machine the purpose of which is to allow separating, in a fast, simple and safe manner, the metal portion of sharp, pointed objects, such as syringes, scalpels or other instruments used in hospitals, clinics, health centers, etc., thereby allowing recycling thereof and preventing accidents. Field of Application of the Invention The field of application of the present invention is encompassed within the sector of the industry dedicated to manufacturing recycling systems, devices and apparatus, focusing particularly on those intended for the health field. Background of the Invention It is known that waste generated in healthcare centers, such as, for example, hospitals, must be recycled. This, however, is not easy in cases such as syringes, scalpels, some tools used in dentistry, and generally any type of sharp, pointed object. The reason is that these elements can have portions made of different materials, or recyclable and non-recyclable portions that are firmly attached to one another. For example, syringes are formed by a plastic reservoir attached to a metal needle; scalpels can have a reusable handle attached to a disposable blade, etc. Today, in these cases the entire part is thrown into yellow containers distributed for such purpose by the hospital so that they can subsequently then be discarded. The economic loss and environmental damage entailed by this treatment is easily understood. Brief Description of the Invention The present invention solves the described problems as a result of a machine particularly designed for separating the hypodermic needle from the plastic reservoir in syringes, and the handle from the blade in scalpels. This allows recycling, on one hand, plastic materials (plastic reservoirs of syringes, the handle of single-use scalpels, etc.) and, on the other hand, metal materials (syringe needles, scalpel blades). A significant advantage of this invention relates to the reduction of occupational accidents with sharp, pointed objects, since the risk is eliminated at the same time in which it is created. Furthermore, there is a need to mention the obvious environmental benefits of recycling materials that were previously discarded, also the amount of recipients for sharp objects the manufacture thereof could be avoided, as well as the improvement in the income obtained as a result of recycling these elements, in addition to the fact that it is no longer necessary to pay a waste management company to dispose of sharp, pointed objects, since with this system the waste can be sterilized in an autoclave separately in the same center for subsequent recycling. The economic benefit is therefore doubled. The machine for recycling sharp, pointed objects of the present invention fundamentally comprises the following elements: A hollow casing having a substantially planar upper metal surface and a lower surface below which there is housed a reservoir for metallic waste. The mentioned upper surface of the casing comprises at least one spout for introducing the needles of the syringes, the diameter of which allows passage of the needle but not passage of the body of a syringe, an extraction system for extracting the needle which allows easily separating same from the plastic body or portion being provided below said spout. It must be pointed out that although the invention can be implemented in the most essential form with a single spout for syringes, in a preferred embodiment, two spouts of different sizes are arranged, one for large syringes and another for small syringes. The existence of a device for disassembling both single-use and multi-use scalpel blades is also contemplated in the upper portion of the machine. Said device preferably consists of an H-shaped opening with a metal tongue adapted underneath same, this tongue being structured for holding the scalpel blade when rotating it, such that when introducing the scalpel through the upper portion of the opening, the blade is moved from its housing, making it rotate slightly, and by pulling the handle of the scalpel upwards, as the scalpel is held in the tongue, it is separated from the handle and falls into the metallic waste reservoir. Optionally, the machine furthermore has an additional freely accessible opening, preferably provided with a closure lid, and the size of which allows introducing other metallic waste generated in hospitals and medical centers that do not require the separation of non-metal portions. Some small metal tools such as drills used in dentistry or suture needles used in other fields can be thrown away through this freely accessible opening, for example. In turn, in a preferred embodiment of the invention the syringe needle extraction system consists of a pair of gear wheels meshing with one another and arranged below each spout for syringes. Each pair of gear wheels which are moved by an electric motor catch and take the needle out of the syringe introduced through the spout while rotating. To that end, the hollow casing has therein a motor and a battery or a connection to the system, furthermore having a start push-button, a connector for charging the battery and a three-position switch, i.e., left, right and stop positions, for rotating the shaft of the motor in one direction or another. Therefore, when the user introduces the hypodermic needle of a syringe through the suitable spout, the hand holding the syringe is supported on the push-button which the machine has in the upper portion and the pair of gear wheels engages the needle and pulls it downwards. Since the spout has a size slightly smaller than the diameter of the body of the syringe, the latter is immobilized therein. As a result, the gear wheels take the needle out of the reservoir, the needle falling through the ramp that allows access to the metallic waste reservoir. The electric motor used for operating the gears can be a DC motor, in which case it would be connected to a 12V DC battery. This configuration would allow implementing the machine of the invention in moving structures, such as for example a trolley for medical or clinical use. However, in another preferred embodiment of the invention, an AC motor is used, in which case it would be connected to the 220V AC power grid. As indicated, the described syringe needle extraction system provided below the spouts is a preferred embodiment option, however, the incorporation in the machine of other alternative extraction systems for extraction using pressure, rotation, absorption etc., and operated by means of an electric motor or by means of a manual mechanism, is not ruled out. In any case, the casing contemplates below the needle extraction system a lower access surface for accessing the metal object reservoir, which is removable so that it can be emptied. This lower surface is configured like a box with an access ramp, and to prevent the metallic waste from being able to come out when extracting the reservoir, the latter is provided with a sliding lid which is coupled to guides provided in the lower portion of said box with a ramp below which it is located. Therefore, the sliding lid is coupled by means of guides to the upper portion of the reservoir and is fixed thereto by a screw that it has in the upper portion, or by any other system. The reservoir is in turn fixed to the box by means of a magnet that the latter has in the inner wall, for example. It is thereby assured that the reservoir is always open so that the waste falls into it, and when it is extracted, the sliding lid thereof closes to prevent waste from coming out from inside the reservoir. The reservoir stores the needles taken out of the syringes, the blades disassembled from the scalpels and other metallic waste that may have optionally been introduced through the additional opening. This reservoir will contain only metal parts, and therefore recycling is possible without needing subsequent complex and costly separations. It must be mentioned that the reservoir does not need any fill detector, since it will be sized to have sufficient capacity for storing needles up to six months, as required by biological waste regulations. However, if this were not the case in some cases, it can further comprise a fill detector located close to the upper edge thereof, for example, an ultrasound detector. This detector will be able to activate a visual alarm, such as a light indicator, for example, a LED, indicating that the reservoir is full, or it can simply be a metal detector which, when it detects the metallic waste, blocks the operation of the machine and makes the replacement thereof necessary. Therefore, the waste generated, for example, after a surgery can be disposed of in a fast, simple and safe manner. Introducing each syringe used in the corresponding spout will be sufficient, the machine of the invention being responsible for taking out the metal needles and storing them together with the metallic waste. The user will then throw the plastic body of the syringe into the plastic container. Similarly, the user introducing the scalpel blade used in said operation through the corresponding H-shaped opening and then slightly rotating the blade inserted therein will be sufficient. By pulling on the handle, the blade is locked in the tongue, being taken out of the handle, and it will be stored in the reservoir of the machine. The described machine for recycling sharp, pointed objects therefore represents an innovative structure having structural and constitutive features that were unknown up until now for this purpose, and these reasons combined with its practical usefulness give the invention sufficient grounds for obtaining the exclusive right that is sought. Description of the Drawings To complement the description that is being made and for the purpose of aiding to better understand the features of the invention, a set of drawings is attached to the present specification as an integral part thereof, in which the following has been depicted with an illustrative and nonlimiting character: Figure 1 shows an exploded perspective view of one embodiment of the machine for recycling sharp, pointed objects, object of the invention, the main portions and elements it comprises being seen therein.Figure 2 shows an enlarged view of the system for separating scalpel blades incorporated in the machine according to the invention.Figure 3 shows a sectioned side elevational view of the example of the machine according to the invention shown in Figure 1, being depicted once assembled. Preferred Embodiment of the Invention In view of the mentioned drawings and according to the numbering used, a preferred embodiment of the invention which comprises the portions and elements indicated and described in detail below can be seen therein. Therefore, in reference to said drawings, in which an example of the machine of the present invention is shown, it can be seen how the machine (1) at hand comprises a casing (2) having an essentially planar upper front metal surface (2a), below which there is coupled a box (2b) with a surface in the form of a ramp that allows access to a reservoir (11) located therebelow. The upper surface (2a) has one or more spouts (3) having suitable diameters for introducing the needles of the syringes to be disposed of, as well as at least one H-shaped opening (4) associated with means for disassembling the scalpel blade and optionally at least one additional freely accessible opening (5) with a lid, for introducing other metallic waste, such as some tools such as drills, suture needles, etc. The machine has associated with each spout (3) an extraction system for extracting the mentioned needles for separating them from their body which, in a preferred embodiment of the invention as shown in the drawings, consists of respective pairs of gear wheels (6) meshing with one another and held by a support (7), although any other extraction system that can remove the needle from the plastic by pulling on it can be incorporated for said needle extraction. In this example, the pairs of gear wheels (6) are located in line immediately below each spout (3) and meshing with one another, such that all of them are moved when the electric motor (8) provided in the casing (1) for such purpose operates the drive gear wheel which is associated with the shaft thereof, by means of screwing or by another fastening system. Therefore, it is not necessary to use any movement transmission mechanism for operating all the gear wheels (6), the electric motor (8) being able to be located in the hollow rear portion of the casing (2) of the machine (1), which can be accessed for quicker repair from a practicable lid (not shown). There has been provided in the upper portion of the casing (2) a push-button (2c) for starting up the motor (8) and operating the gear mechanism. On the other hand, there has been provided a three-position switch (9) allowing passage of the power supply and reversing the direction of rotation of the motor (8) and thereby causing the gears (6) to be released and the support (7) in which they are coupled to be extracted for easy cleaning. The electric motor (8) is powered by means of a 12V DC battery (13) which can be recharged by plugging a battery charger into a plug (10), although it can also be directly connected to the 220V AC grid. In reference to Figure 2, it can be observed how in the H-shaped opening (4) incorporated in the machine for disassembling scalpel blades, there has been provided a metal tongue (4b) adapted therebelow and the configuration of which allows holding the blades such that when introducing the scalpel through the upper portion of the H-shaped opening (4), the blade is moved from its housing, and by pulling the handle of the scalpel upwards, it is immobilized in the tongue, falling into the metallic objects reservoir (11). The casing (2) is preferably formed by a rear body in which, where appropriate, the motor and the battery are housed, and a front part with an open front the upper portion of which constitutes the planar upper surface in which the spouts for the syringe needles , the H-shaped opening for the scalpel blades and the additional freely accessible opening are located, the lower portion of said front part of the machine (1) being taken up by the reservoir (11) into which all the syringe needles, scalpel blades and other metal tools introduced in the machine (1) fall. This reservoir has the particularity of having a sliding lid (12) which, when inserted in the respective guides (12a) provided in the upper portion of the reservoir (11), also in turn enters other complementary guides (12b) of the box (2b) with a ramp below which there is located the reservoir, such that when the reservoir is introduced below said box (2b), by pushing it inwards the sliding lid opens, leaving the passage open for the waste to fall therein, and when the reservoir is extracted, the sliding lid closes so that the infected waste cannot be accessed until it is sterilized in an autoclave or any sterilization system. To fix said sliding lid (12) in its closed position, a closing system consisting, for example, of a screw (12c) is contemplated. Having sufficiently described the nature of the present invention as well as the manner of putting it into practice, it is not considered necessary to further describe the invention so that a person skilled in the art can comprehend the scope thereof and advantages derived from it, stating that it could be carried out to practice within its essential features in other embodiments differing in detail from that indicated by way of example, and such embodiments would also be covered by the protection that is sought provided that the fundamental principle thereof is neither altered, changed nor modified.
