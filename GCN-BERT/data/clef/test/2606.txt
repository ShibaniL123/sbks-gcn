(3) Preparation of Compound 1C
Compound 1B (84.3 g, 361.38 mmol) was put into an excessive amount of phosphinyl trichloride (POCl3), and the resulting mixture was refluxed at 120Â° C. After the mixture was cooled to normal temperature, an ethanol/water mixed solution was introduced into the mixture, and then the resulting mixture was filtered. The filtered solid was slurry treated with acetonitrile, and then the resulting product was again filtered and dried to obtain Compound 1C (63.3 g, 60%).
