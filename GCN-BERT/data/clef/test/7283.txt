While the illustrated barrel 22 is generally fight circular cylindrical, it is understood that the word "cylindrical," as used in this application, is used in the mathematical sense, that is, to descñbe the body defined by a line moving in a closed plane path always parallel to another line. When the closed plane path is a circle, the cylinder is a circular cylinder; when an ellipse, a elliptical cylinder, and so on. When the ends of the cylinder are perpendicular to its axis, the cylinder is called a right cylinder. The surface 27 of CA 02735835 2011-03-21 .IO esophageal flange 26 facing away from barrel 22 is contoured to reduce the possibility of dislodgement and to facilitate sealing of the transesophageal fistula as described in WO 031057082. The esophageal tim-age 26 is also somewhat "teardrop" shaped in elevation to aid in orienting device 20 properly during insertion and in maintaining its orientation once inserted. The barrel 22 illustratively is molded from 50-60 durometer silicone, such as, for example, NuSil Technology med-4960 silicone. As is customary of such devices 20, the tracheal flange 24 is provided with a strap 28 for fixing, for example, with adhesive tape, to the paratracheal skin 30 of the wearer 32. Additionally, the strap 28 may include attachment means for cooperating with attachment means on an insertion tool (not shown) with the aid of which the device 20 may be inserted into a tracheoesophageal puncture 34 of the wearer 32 to aid in the production of alaryngeal speech, ail in accordance with well-known principles. Barrel 22 includes a passageway 36 which in the illustrated embodiment is also generally right circular cylindrical. The inside diameter of sidewall 38 of the passageway 36 from the tracheal end 24 is slightly smaller. The inside diameter of the sidewall 40 of the passageway 36 from the esophageal end 26 is slightly larger. At a boundary 42 between diameters 38 and 40, the inside diameter tapers to a smaller diameter than the diameter of either sidewall 38 or sidewall 40, providing a radially inwardly extending stop 44. Between stop 44 and the esophageal end 26 of barrel 22, the inside diameter of barrel 22 is constant. A number, illustratively rive, of somewhat right trapezoidal prism-shaped stops 46 project radially inwardly toward the axis 48 of device 20. The word "prism," as used in this application, is used in the mathematical sense, that is, to describe a solid figure whose bases or ends have the same size and shape and are parallel to one another, and each of whose sides is a parallelogram. Illustratively, stops 46 are perimetrally equally spaced at 72° intervals around sidewall Referring now to Figs. 9-19, a cartridge 50 mounting a valve flap 52 and a valve seat 54 is inserted from the tracheal end 24 into barrel 22. Cartridge 50 is pushed into barrel 22 past stops 46 and is captured between stops 46 and stop 44. The sloping sides of stops 46 aid in the insertion of cartñdge 50 into barrel 22. Cartñdge 50 includes a tracheal end 56 and an esophageal end 58. Esophageal end 58 is notched 60 along part of its perimeter to receive an elastomeric tab 62 by which etastomeric valve flap 52 is molded to projected inwardly toward the center of an elastomeric ring 64. Ring 64, tab 62 and valve flap 52 illustratively are molded as a single component from about 5 wt,% to about 11 wt.% silver oxide powder filIed-Nu5il Technology reed-4960 silicone with a very small amount of an inhibitor, for example, .00043 wt.%, of 2-methy-3-butyn-2-ol. CA 02735835 2011-03-21 Ring 64 is received in a radially outwardly opening groove 66 provided on the outer surface of cartridge 50, with tab 62 oriented to extend through notch 60. Tab 62 and valve flap 52 are molded at an angle of, for example, 15° from perpendicular to the axis 48 of device 20 to be biased against seat 54 in the assembled device 20. A band or ring 68 of, for example, titanium, is slipped around cartridge 50 over ring 64 after cartridge is assembled, and before cartridge 50 is inserted into barrel 22. Cartridge 50 further includes two passageways 72 which extend generally across cartridge 50 and are defined between chords of the circular sidewall 74 which defines the outer dimension ofcartñdge 50 when viewed from an end thereof. Once cartridge 50 is assembled into barrel 22, an amount of a material, such as, for example, a room temperature curing silicone adhesive, sufficient to fill each passageway 72 is introduced, for example, by using a fixture 75 of the type illustrated in Figs. 20-21. As best illustrated in Fig. 14, in the illustrated embodiment of the cartñdge 50, the passageways 72 intersect the inside diameter of the cartñdge 50, and thus are accessible through it. Fixture 75 includes a base 77 having adjustable legs 79 and a connector 81 for connecting it to a source 83 of the mateñal which is to be injected into passageways 72. A needle 85 having a central passageway 87 communicating with connector 79 terminates adjacent a tip 89 of needle 85 in two diametrical openings 93 in needle Needle 85 also includes a shoulder 95 against which the tracheal end of cartridge rests, presenting openings 93 at the inner ends of the passageways 72. Passageways 72 are properly aligned in communication with openings 93 by cooperating features 97, 99 on needle 85 and cartridge 50, respectively. An amount of the material is then injected through openings 93 into passageways 72 sufficient to fill them. The material may also be injected using (a) needle(s) through sidewall 40 into passageways 72. However the material is introduced, as the material cures in contact with the inner sidewall 40, it works to secure the cartridge 50, and the valve 52, 54 contained within it, in place in the barrel 22. Cartridge 50 illustratively is constructed from Kynal 720 brand polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or Estane® 58091 brand thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). An illustrative room temperature cuñng silicone adhesive is NuSil Technology med-1511 room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone adhesive. Referring now to Figs. 7-8, in another embodiment, a barrel 122 includes a passageway 136 which in the illustrated embodiment is also generally fight circular cylindrical. The inside diameter of sidewall 140 of the passageway 136 from the esophageal end 126 has as first dimension. From the tracheal end 124, the inside CA 02735835 2011-03-21 diameter tapers to a smaller diameter than the diameter of sidewall 140, providing a radially inwardly extending stop 144. Between stop 144 and the esophageal end 126 of barrel 122 the inside diameter of barrel 122 is constant. A number, again, illustratively rive, of somewhat trapezoidal prism-shaped stops 146 project radially inwardly toward the axis 148 of device 120. Illustratively, stops 146 are perimetrally equally spaced at 72° intervals around sidewall 140. The region of barrel 122 between stop 144 and stops 14ú is sized to accommodate the same cartridge 50 as the embodiment of Figs. 1-6. CA 02735835 2011-03-21 1.
