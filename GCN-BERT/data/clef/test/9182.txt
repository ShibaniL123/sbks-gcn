To a solution of the whole amount of the obtained compound 53i in dichloromethane (26 mL), EDC hydrochloride (933 mg, 4.87 mmol) was added under ice cooling. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by water and brine in this order and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to afford the compound 53j (1.94 g, yield 96%) as a white foam.
