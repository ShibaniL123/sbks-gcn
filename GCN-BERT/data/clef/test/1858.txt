JAK1 INHIBITORS FOR THE TREATMENT OF MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Prov. Appl. No. 61/946,124, filed February 28, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to JAK1 selective inhibitors and their use in treating myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). BACKGROUND Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), known previously as dysmyelopoietic syndromes or preleukemia, are heterogeneous and clonal hematopoietic disorders that are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis on one or more of the major myeloid cell lineages. Myelodysplastic syndromes are associated with bone marrow failure, peripheral blood cytopenias, and a propensity to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Moreover, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities can be detected in about 50% of cases with MDS. In the general population, MDS occurs in 5 per 100,000 and the incidence increases with age, reaching to about 22 to 45 per 100,000 in individuals older than 70 years (Greenberg, "The myelodysplastic syndromes" in Hoffman, et al, eds. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice (3rd ed.), Churchill Livingston; 2000: 1106-1129; Liesveld and Lichtman, Chapter 88. "Myelodysplastic Syndromes (Clonal Cytopenias and Oligoblastic Myelogenous Leukemia)", in Prchal et al, eds. Williams Hematology. 8th ed., New York: McGraw-Hill; 2010). Despite scientific advances in our knowledge of the pathophysiology of MDS, there are few therapeutic options available and are mostly palliative, especially when affected patients are not candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The standard of care for MDS includes supportive care that involves observation and clinical monitoring, psychosocial support, and efforts to improve QOL (Cheson, et al, Blood 2000;96:3671-3674; Venugopal et al. Cancer Treat Res 2001; 108:257-265; Greenberg, Int JPed Hem-One 1997;4:231-238). In addition, RBC transfusions for symptomatic anemia and platelet transfusions for bleeding episodes from thrombocytopenia are needed. Myelodysplasia syndrome patients requiring RBC transfusions may develop complications including development of alloantibodies requiring increasing transfusion frequency, and iron overload with end- organ damage to the liver, heart, and endocrine organs requiring iron-chelation to maintain serum ferritin at < 1000 Î¼g/L (Venugopal et al 2001 (supra), Greenberg 1997 (supra)). In cases with refractory symptomatic cytopenia, hematopoietic cytokine support is needed, such as the use of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G CSF) or granulocyte-monocyte CSF (GM-CSF) for neutropenic MDS with infectious complications, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) for symptomatic anemia (Cheson et al 2000 (supra), Jadersten et al, Blood 2005; 106:803-811 ; Schiffer, Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program 2006:205- 210). In early stage MDS, ie, IPSS low and IPSS Intermediate- 1, symptomatic anemia is the most common reason requiring therapeutic intervention. The ESA benefits only a fraction of these patients with the highest response seen in patients who are not RBC transfusion dependent or those with a low endogenous EPO level (< 500 IU) (Cheson et al 2000 (supra), Jadersten et al 2005 (supra), Schiffer 2006 (supra), Fenaux, et al, Lancet Oncol 2009; 10:223-232). Eventually, patients stop responding to ESA therapy and require RBC transfusion support, although ESA is typically continued even when RBC transfusions are needed and reticulocyte counts are low. Transfusion requirement may vary and may be influenced by concomitant medical issues requiring a higher Hgb level such as angina, development of alloantibodies to RBC, splenomegaly, and occult gastrointestinal hemorrhage from thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction (Venugopal et al 2001 (supra), Greenberg 1997 (supra), Fenaux et al 2009 (supra)). Low-intensity therapy includes the use of low-intensity chemotherapy or biological response modifiers (BRM). Hypomethylating agents such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors 5 azacytidine and decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) have been shown to reduce the risk of leukemic transformation in randomized Phase 3 studies and improve overall survival in a proportion of patients (Fenaux et al 2009 (supra), Silverman, J Clin Oncol 2002;20:2429-2440; Silverman, J Clin Oncol 2006;24:3895-3903). Similarly, decitabine has demonstrated a higher disease response rate, duration of remission, time to AML progression, and survival benefit in MDS patients with intermediate-risk and high risk disease. In addition, decitabine demonstrated significant improvement in patient-reported QOL (based on The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC QLQ C30]) for the dimensions of fatigue and physical functioning (Kantarjian, et al, Cancer 2006; 106: 1794-1803; Lubbert, et al., Br J Haematol 2001 ; 114:349-357; Lubbert, et al, J Clin Oncol 201 1;29: 1987-1996). Both 5-azacytidine and decitabine are approved for MDS treatment and specifically provides clinical benefit and recommended by the NCCN MDS panel for patients with IPSS intermediate 2 and high-risk MDS (National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). Myelodysplastic Syndromes Guidelines Version 1. 2012. www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp). Inflammatory molecules have been implicated as regulatory cues driving the proliferation and apoptotic death of hematopoietic progenitors in MDS. Chronic immune stimulation, coupled with senescence dependent changes in both hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) and the BM microenvironment, are believed to be critical to the pathogenesis of the disease. Increasing evidence implicates the activation of innate immune signaling in both hematopoietic senescence and the pathobiology of MDS (Chen et al, 2014). As such, immune modifiers that include T cell inhibitors such as antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine, and thalidomide and its analog lenalidomide (Molldrem, et al, Br J Haematol 1997;99:699-705; Sloand, et al, J Clin Oncol 2008;26:2505-2511 ; Raza, et al, Blood 2008; 11 1 :86-93; Fenaux, et al, Blood 201 1; 1 18:3765-3776; List, et al., N Engl J Med 2005;352:549-557) are used as low intensity agents MDS. High-intensity therapy for MDS include intensive induction chemotherapy, as is used for treating AML and HSCT. Different intensive chemotherapeutic regimens have been tested as they have the potential for altering the natural history of the disease and comparative studies have failed to show benefit; this approach remains investigational and a possible option for MDS patients with high-risk disease. Allogeneic HSCT, the only curative treatment modality for MDS and preferably from a matched sibling donor, is a preferred option for high-risk MDS patients, but the lack of a suitable donor and comorbidities related to advancing age often preclude these patients from undergoing this procedure ( CCN 2012 (supra); Larson, Best Pract Res Clin Hematol 2006; 19:293-300; Schiffer, Best Pract Res Clin Hematol 2007;20:49-55). Accordingly, there is a need to develop new therapies for the treatment of myelodysplasia syndromes. This application addresses this need and others. SUMMARY The present application provides methods of treating a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a JAKl selective inhibitor, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The present application further provides a JAKl selective inhibitor for the treatment of a myelodysplastic syndrome in a patient in need thereof. The present application also provides use of a JAKl selective inhibitor for manufacture of a medicament for use in treatment of a myelodysplastic syndrome in a patient in need thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The methods described herein utilize JAKl selective inhibitors. A JAKl selective inhibitor is a compound that inhibits JAKl activity preferentially over other Janus kinases. JAKl plays a central role in a number of cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways that, when dysregulated, can result in or contribute to disease states. For example, IL-6 levels are elevated in rheumatoid arthritis, a disease in which it has been suggested to have detrimental effects (Fonesca, et al, Autoimmunity Reviews, 8:538-42, 2009). Because IL-6 signals, at least in part, through JAKl, antagonizing IL-6 directly or indirectly through JAKl inhibition is expected to provide clinical benefit (Guschin, et al Embo J 14: 1421, 1995; Smolen, et al. Lancet 371 :987, 2008). Moreover, in some cancers JAKl is mutated resulting in constitutive undesirable tumor cell growth and survival (Mullighan, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 106:9414-8, 2009; Flex, J Exp Med. 205:751-8, 2008). In other autoimmune diseases and cancers elevated systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines that activate JAKl may also contribute to the disease and/or associated symptoms. Therefore, patients with such diseases may benefit from JAKl inhibition. Selective inhibitors of JAKl may be efficacious while avoiding unnecessary and potentially undesirable effects of inhibiting other JAK kinases. Selective inhibitors of JAKl, relative to other JAK kinases, may have multiple therapeutic advantages over less selective inhibitors. With respect to selectivity against JAK2, a number of important cytokines and growth factors signal through JAK2 including, for example, erythropoietin (Epo) and thrombopoietin (Tpo) (Parganas, et al. Cell. 93 :385-95, 1998). Epo is a key growth factor for red blood cells production; hence a paucity of Epo-dependent signaling can result in reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia (Kaushansky, NEJM 354:2034-45, 2006). Tpo, another example of a JAK2-dependent growth factor, plays a central role in controlling the proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes - the cells from which platelets are produced (Kaushansky, NEJM 354:2034-45, 2006). As such, reduced Tpo signaling would decrease megakaryocyte numbers (megakaryocytopenia) and lower circulating platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). This can result in undesirable and/or uncontrollable bleeding. Reduced inhibition of other JAKs, such as JAK3 and Tyk2, may also be desirable as humans lacking functional version of these kinases have been shown to suffer from numerous maladies such as severe-combined immunodeficiency or hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Minegishi, et al. Immunity 25:745-55, 2006; Macchi, et al. Nature, 377:65-8, 1995). Therefore a JAKl inhibitor with reduced affinity for other JAKs would have significant advantages over a less- selective inhibitor with respect to reduced side effects involving immune suppression, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Inflammatory cytokines play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MDS, which results in cytopenias and dysplastic hematopoiesis. It is hypothesized that curbing the activity of these inflammatory cytokines will promote normal hematopoiesis and relieve the marrow precursors from premature apoptosis. The inflammatory cytokines mediate downstream effects by JAK activation which involves juxtapositioning of JAKs from ligand-mediated receptor dimerization and trans/autophosphorylation. The resultant JAK heterodimers, comprised of JAKl and JAK2 or JAKl and JAK3, transduce signals and mediate cellular responses of these cytokines. Moreover, JAK homodimers, comprised of only JAK2, transduce signals from bone marrow growth factors such as EPO, which is responsible for stimulating erythropoiesis, and TPO, which is responsible for stimulating thrombopoiesis. Therefore, a selective JAK1 inhibitor would result in abrogation of the inflammatory cytokine signaling without inhibiting JAK2-mediated erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis, resulting in the reestablishment of normal hematopoiesis and alleviation of myeloid cytopenias. Despite scientific advances in our knowledge of the pathophysiology of MDS, there are few therapeutic options available and are mostly palliative, especially when affected patients are not candidates for HSCT. A number of studies have indicated that MDS is a clonal disease and demonstrated that the expanded clone was a result of excessive proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. The paradox of a hyperproliferative state in the marrow leading to peripheral cytopenias was investigated and revealed that there was an excessive amount of intramedullary programmed cell death or apoptosis of the hematopoietic cells. This apoptosis was seen in patients with all the FAB categories but decreased in patients with increasing blast counts. It appeared that a clonal population progressively became resistant to apoptosis and gained a proliferative advantage over the normal hematopoietic precursors that led to the increase in blast counts and evolution to AML. It also became evident that the excessive apoptosis was largely mediated by a number of proinflammatory cytokines that are overexpressed in the marrows of patients with MDS. The cytokines that have been implicated in the pathobiology of MDS include tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), interferon-gamma (IFN Î³) and IL 1Î². High plasma concentration of TNF-a, a classic proapoptotic cytokine, has been observed in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of patients with MDS and a higher expression of TNF receptors and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) has been observed in bone marrow mononuclear cells derived from MDS patients. Similarly, an increased amount of IFN Î³ and IL 1Î² has been found in MDS bone marrow mononuclear cells and IL- 1 Î² has been implicated in the evolution of AML from MDS. The IL-Î Î² has variable regulatory effects on the hematopoietic cells as it stimulates GM-CSF and IL-3, whereas in higher concentrations as seen in inflammatory states, it leads to suppression of hematopoiesis by induction of TNF a and prostaglandin E2, the latter being a potent suppressor of myeloid stem cell proliferation. In addition, high levels of IL-6, fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and transforming growth factor Î² has been seen in myeloid cells from MDS patients. Moreover, the very cytokines that suppress the normal hematopoietic proliferation and maturation fail to exert this proapoptotic effect on the evolving abnormal clone that results in selective proliferation of these abnormal cells. There is evidence that the source of these proinflammatory cytokines is the altered bone marrow microenvironment that normally nurtures the normal hematopoietic cells to proliferate and differentiate, and may also be the reason for the infiltration of immune regulatory cells and angiogenesis that contributes to the pathobiology of MDS (Raza, et al, Blood 1995;86:268-276; Raza, et al, Int JHematol 1996a;63 :265-278; Raza, et al, Leuk Res 1996b;20:881-890; Mundle, et al. Am J Hematol 1999;60:36-47; Claessens, et al. , Blood 2002 ;99 : 1594- 1601 ). The concept that the cytokine-mediated proinflammatory state is responsible for the etiology of MDS has led to the novel approach of anticytokine therapy to improve the cytopenias in MDS by protecting the differentiating hematopoietic cells from premature apoptosis. There has been demonstration that anti-TNF-a agents like thalidomide and its analog lenalidomide, infliximab, and etanercept have been effective in improving cytopenias in MDS patients (NCCN 2012 (supra), Larson 2006 (supra), Schiffer 200 '(supra)). In a study of 14 MDS patients, etanercept showed erythroid hematologic improvement in 25% of patients along with improvement in platelet counts and ANC in 12.5% of evaluable patients. Additionally combining intermittent etanercept with ATG resulted in a higher erythroid hematologic improvement and 5 of the 14 MDS patients requiring transfusion became RBC and platelet transfusion independent that lasted beyond 2 years. In a study investigating thalidomide in MDS, of the 83 patients enrolled, 51 completed 12 weeks of therapy and 16 patients showed hematologic improvement with 10 previously transfusion- dependent patients becoming transfusion independent and most of the responders were in either the IPSS low-risk or intermediate 1 risk category (NCCN 2012 (supra)). Moreover, higher risk category patients, especially with a high blast percentage, tended to discontinue treatment early. Another approach to curb the effects of the proinflammatory cytokines is to inhibit their cellular responses. A considerable number of cytokine and growth factor receptors utilize the JAK family of nonreceptor TYKs to transmit extracellular ligand binding into a cellular response via the transcription factor STAT signaling. There are 4 members of JAKs: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. The JAKs are constitutively associated with cytokine and growth factor receptors and have become activated as an immediate consequence of ligand-induced receptor dimerization, JAK activation occurs upon the subsequent juxtapositioning of the JAKs and the trans/autophosphorylation of conserved tyrosines found in the activation loop of the JAK catalytic domain. Upon phosphorylation of these tyrosines, the JAKs enter a high-activity state and are then able to phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues on the cytokine receptors, which serve as docking sites for multiple proteins, including the STAT proteins. The JAKs are the principal family of kinases associated with STAT activation. Activated STATs translocate to the nucleus where they function as transcription factors and drive the expression of multiple genes important for cell activation, localization, survival, and proliferation. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor has demonstrated marked reduction in spleen size in patients with myelofibrosis and improvement of symptoms. These improvements were apparent in subjects with and without the presence of the V617F mutation in JAK2 and are likely related to inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines. The primary adverse events (AEs) observed with ruxolitinib are thrombocytopenia and anemia; both were infrequently the cause of study discontinuation in a double- blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, and both are due at least in part to JAK2- mediated myelosuppression. It is therefore hypothesized that selective inhibition of JAK1 would exert a salutary effect of inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines in patients with MDS and result in the amelioration of the cytopenias resulting from premature apoptosis of the hematopoietic precursors. Moreover, sparing of JAK2 activity would allow the physiological activity of hematopoietic cytokines namely EPO and TPO to allow physiological proliferation and differentiation of the normal hematopoietic cells. Further, iron overload frequently occurs in MDS patients, with recent data suggesting an impact on both overall and leukemia- free survival. It has been postulated that an altered production of hepcidin, the recently discovered key hormone regulating iron homeostasis, may play a role in this regard and be regulated by inflammatory cytokines like IL-6. It has recently been shown in MDS that both hepcidin and CRP, as a marker of general inflammation, are elevated. Santini, et al, PLoS One, 6(8), e23109, pages 1-8 (201 1). These data suggest that JAK inhibition, which can reduce CRP and hepcidin levels, may reverse the inflammation and iron overload that occurs in MDS. Accordingly, the present application provides, inter alia, a method of treating a myelodysplasia syndrome in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a JAK 1 selective inhibitor, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. As used herein, a myelodysplastic syndrome refers to the classification of MDS proposed by the World Health Organization in 2008 (see e.g., Table 1). In particular, in 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) in conjunction with the Society for Hematopathology (SH) and the European Association of Hematopathology (EAHP) proposed new classifications for hematopoietic neoplasms (Harris, et al, J Clin Oncol 1999; 17:3835-3849; Vardiman, et al, Blood 2002; 100:2292-2302). For MDS, the WHO utilized not only the morphologic criteria from the French-American-British (FAB) classification but also incorporated available genetic, biologic, and clinical characteristics to define subsets of MDS (Bennett, et al, Br J Haematol 1982;51 : 189-199). In 2008, the WHO classification of MDS (Table 1) was further refined to allow precise and prognostically relevant subclassification of unilineage dysplasia by incorporating new clinical and scientific information (Vardiman, et al, Blood 2009; 114:937-951; Swerdlow, et al, WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. 4th Edition. Lyon France: IARC Press; 2008:88-103; Bunning and Germing, "Myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms" in Chapter 5, Swerdlow, et al, eds. WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues, (ed. 4th edition): Lyon, France: IARC Press;2008:88-103).

For example, the compounds described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, preferentially inhibit JAKl over one or more of JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. In some embodiments, the compounds inhibit JAKl preferentially over JAK2 (e.g., have a JAK1/JAK2 ICso ratio >1). In some embodiments, the compounds or salts are about 10-fold more selective for JAKl over JAK2. In some embodiments, the compounds or salts are about 3 -fold, about 5 -fold, about 10-fold, about 15-fold, or about 20-fold more selective for JAKl over JAK2 as calculated by measuring ICso at 1 mM ATP (e.g., see Example A).

Suitable resolving agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids such as Î²-camphorsulfonic acid. Other resolving agents suitable for fractional crystallization methods include stereoisomerically pure forms of a-methylbenzylamine (e.g., S and R forms, or diastereomerically pure forms), 2-phenylglycinol, norephedrine, ephedrine, N- methylephedrine, cyclohexylethylamine, 1 ,2-diaminocyclohexane, and the like. Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution solvent composition can be determined by one skilled in the art. Compounds described herein also include tautomeric forms. Tautomeric forms result from the swapping of a single bond with an adjacent double bond together with the concomitant migration of a proton. Tautomeric forms include prototropic tautomers which are isomeric protonation states having the same empirical formula and total charge. Example prototropic tautomers include ketone - enol pairs, amide - imidic acid pairs, lactam - lactim pairs, enamine - imine pairs, and annular forms where a proton can occupy two or more positions of a heterocyclic system, for example, 1H- and 3H-imidazole, 1H-, 2H- and 4H- 1,2,4-triazole, 1H- and 2H- isoindole, and 1H- and 2H-pyrazole. Tautomeric forms can be in equilibrium or sterically locked into one form by appropriate substitution. Compounds of the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium. The term, "compound," as used herein is meant to include all stereoisomers, geometric iosomers, tautomers, and isotopes of the structures depicted. Further, compounds herein identified by name or structure as one particular tautomeric form are intended to include other tautomeric forms unless otherwise specified. All compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be found together with other substances such as water and solvents (e.g., hydrates and solvates) or can be isolated. In some embodiments, the compounds described herein, or salts thereof, are substantially isolated. By "substantially isolated" is meant that the compound is at least partially or substantially separated from the environment in which it was formed or detected.

Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms When employed as pharmaceuticals, the JAK1 selective inhibitors can be administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including transdermal, epidermal, ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal or intranasal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal intramuscular or injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, the JAK1 selective inhibitor described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (excipients). In some embodiments, the composition is suitable for topical administration. In making the compositions, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders. In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh. The JAK1 selective inhibitors may be milled using known milling procedures such as wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the JAK1 selective inhibitors can be prepared by processes known in the art, e.g., see International App. No. WO 2002/000196. Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose.

In some embodiments, the polyethylene oxide is polyethylene oxide WSR 1105 (e.g., Polyox WSR 1105â¢). In some embodiments, a wet granulation process is used to produce the composition. In some embodiments, a dry granulation process is used to produce the composition. The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 1,000 mg (1 g), more usually about 100 mg to about 500 mg, of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 10 mg of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 50 mg of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 25 mg of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. In some embodiments, the compositions contain from about 2 mg to about 10 mg, or about 5 mg to about 50 mg of the active ingredient.

The active compound may be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate. The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner. Topical formulations can contain one or more conventional carriers. In some embodiments, ointments can contain water and one or more hydrophobic carriers selected from, for example, liquid paraffin, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, propylene glycol, white Vaseline, and the like. Carrier compositions of creams can be based on water in combination with glycerol and one or more other components, e.g. glycerinemonostearate, PEG-glycerinemonostearate and cetylstearyl alcohol. Gels can be formulated using isopropyl alcohol and water, suitably in combination with other components such as, for example, glycerol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like. In some embodiments, topical formulations contain at least about 0.1, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.5, at least about 1, at least about 2, or at least about 5 wt % of the compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The topical formulations can be suitably packaged in tubes of, for example, 100 g which are optionally associated with instructions for the treatment of the select indication, e.g., psoriasis or other skin condition. The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like. The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 1 1, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts. The therapeutic dosage of a JAK1 selective inhibitor described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the JAK1 selective inhibitor can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 Î¼g/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. The compositions of the invention can further include one or more additional pharmaceutical agents such as a chemotherapeutic, steroid, anti-inflammatory compound, or immunosuppressant, examples of which are listed hereinabove. Kits The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the treatment or prevention of a myelodysplasia syndrome, which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Such kits can further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit.

The catalytic domains of human JAKl (a.a. 837-1142), JAK2 (a.a. 828- 1 132) and JAK3 (a.a. 781-1124) with an N-terminal His tag were expressed using baculovirus in insect cells and purified. The catalytic activity of JAKl, JAK2 or JAK3 was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a biotinylated peptide. The phosphorylated peptide was detected by homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF). IC50S of compounds were measured for each kinase in the 40 microL reactions that contain the enzyme, ATP and 500 nM peptide in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.8) buffer with 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mg/mL (0.01%) BSA. For the 1 mM IC50 measurements, ATP concentration in the reactions was 1 mM. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 1 hour and then stopped with 20 Î¼Ï^ 45 mM EDTA, 300 nM SA-APC, 6 nM Eu-Py20 in assay buffer (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). Binding to the Europium labeled antibody took place for 40 minutes and HTRF signal was measured on a Fusion plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). See Table 2 for data for compounds of the examples as tested by the assay of Example A at 1 mM ATP. Example B: Cellular Assays Cancer cell lines dependent on cytokines and hence JAK/STAT signal transduction, for growth, can be plated at 6000 cells per well (96 well plate format) in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, and 1 nG/niL of appropriate cytokine. Compounds can be added to the cells in DMSO/media (final concentration 0.2% DMSO) and incubated for 72 hours at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2. The effect of compound on cell viability is assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) followed by TopCount (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) quantitation. Potential off-target effects of compounds are measured in parallel using a non-JAK driven cell line with the same assay readout. All experiments are typically performed in duplicate. The above cell lines can also be used to examine the effects of compounds on phosphorylation of JAK kinases or potential downstream substrates such as STAT proteins, Akt, Shp2, or Erk. These experiments can be performed following an overnight cytokine starvation, followed by a brief preincubation with compound (2 hours or less) and cytokine stimulation of approximately 1 hour or less. Proteins are then extracted from cells and analyzed by techniques familiar to those schooled in the art including Western blotting or ELISAs using antibodies that can differentiate between phosphorylated and total protein. These experiments can utilize normal or cancer cells to investigate the activity of compounds on tumor cell survival biology or on mediators of inflammatory disease. For example, with regards to the latter, cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, or IFN can be used to stimulate JAK activation resulting in phosphorylation of STAT protein(s) and potentially in transcriptional profiles (assessed by array or qPCR technology) or production and/or secretion of proteins, such as IL-17. The ability of compounds to inhibit these cytokine mediated effects can be measured using techniques common to those schooled in the art. Compounds herein can also be tested in cellular models designed to evaluate their potency and activity against mutant JAKs, for example, the JAK2V617F mutation found in myeloid proliferative disorders. These experiments often utilize cytokine dependent cells of hematological lineage (e.g. BaF/3) into which the wild- type or mutant JAK kinases are ectopically expressed (James, C, et al. Nature 434: 1144-1148; Staerk, J., et al. JBC 280:41893-41899). Endpoints include the effects of compounds on cell survival, proliferation, and phosphorylated JAK, STAT, Akt, or Erk proteins. Certain compounds herein can be evaluated for their activity inhibiting T-cell proliferation. Such as assay can be considered a second cytokine (i.e. JAK) driven proliferation assay and also a simplistic assay of immune suppression or inhibition of immune activation. The following is a brief outline of how such experiments can be performed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared from human whole blood samples using Ficoll Hypaque separation method and T-cells (fraction 2000) can be obtained from PBMCs by elutriation. Freshly isolated human T-cells can be maintained in culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin) at a density of 2 x 106 cells/ml at 37 Â°C for up to 2 days. For IL-2 stimulated cell proliferation analysis, T-cells are first treated with Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at a final concentration of 10 Î¼g/mL for 72 hours. After washing once with PBS, 6000 cells/well are plated in 96-well plates and treated with compounds at different concentrations in the culture medium in the presence of 100 U/mL human IL-2 (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene; Rehovot, Israel). The plates are incubated at 37 Â°C for 72h and the proliferation index is assessed using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent reagents following the manufactory suggested protocol (Promega; Madison, WI). Assay C. S100A9 Transgenic Mouse Model It was previously shown that S100A9 transgenic mice display bone marrow accumulation of MDSC accompanied by development of progressive multilineage cytopenias and cytological dysplasia similar to MDS. Further, early forced maturation of MDSC by either a//-trans-retinoic acid treatment or active immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-bearing (ITAM-bearing) adapter protein (DAP12) interruption of CD33 signaling rescued the hematologic phenotype and mitigated the disease. This system can be useful to test the effects on JAK1 inhibition on MDS-like disease in a preclinical model. J. Clin. Invest., 123(11):4595- 461 1 (2013), Accordingly, a JAK1 selective inhibitor is dosed by oral gavage. The compound's ability to reduce the cytopenias and cytological dysplasia observed in the S100A9 transgenic mice is monitored.
