Manganese dioxide (43.3 g, 860 mmol) was added to a solution of [4-(cycloheptylamino)-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidin-5-yl]methanol (5b, 13.6 g, 50 mmol) in chloroform (200 mL), and the resulting suspension stirred at room temperature for 15 h. The solids were removed by filtration. The flask and filter cake were rinsed with DCM (150 mLÃ—4). The combined filtrates were filtered again to remove trace solids, and concentrated to give 4-(cycloheptylamino)-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (Intermediate 5, 12.9 g, 98%) as a yellow oil.
