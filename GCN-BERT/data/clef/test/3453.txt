Example 21: Synthesis of 4-isopropoxy-N-(1-(quinolin-5-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzenesulfonamide
To a mixture of 4-isopropoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride (0.080 g, 0.35 mmol) and 1-(quinolin-5-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-amine (prepared from Example 21 step a, 0.032 g, 0.11 mmol) in pyridine (0.5 mL) was heated at 80Â° C. for 4 h with stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and the crude residue was purified by reverse phase HPLC (C18 column, acetonitrile-H2O with 0.1% TFA as eluent) to give the title compound as a white solid (0.025 g, 0.052 mmol, 47%).
