CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of International Patent Application No. PCT/JP2013/078152, filed on Oct. 17, 2013, and claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-229590, filed on Oct. 17, 2012, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field Of The Invention The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition containing a protein-glutaminase. The present invention also relates to a protein hydrophilicity-increasing agent and a protein permeation enhancer, which contain a protein-glutaminase. 2. Discussion Of The Background When a hair treatment such as perm, coloring and the like is applied, it is important to increase hydrophilicity of protein constituting the hair, namely, to swell the hair, so as to enhance permeation of a drug solution to the hair. In this way, permeation of chemicals such as a perming agent, a hair color and the like is facilitated. A hair swelling treatment is mostly performed using an alkaline substance such as ammonia, monoethanolamine and the like (e.g., patent document 1). By doing so, the alkaline substance acts on the hair to ionize polar groups in protein in the hair, and induces structural changes. However, such hair treatment using an alkaline substance simultaneously causes side effects such as hydrolysis of protein, loss of lipid and the like in the hair, and consequently damages hair and induces skin irritation. On the other hand, it is important to permeate an active ingredient contained in a cosmetic or a skin external preparation to hair or skin and enhance the permeation, thereby to increase the effect of the active ingredient. For this end, various permeation enhancers have conventionally been used. As such permeation enhancer, dimethyl sulfoxide, oleic acid, benzyl alcohol and the like are known (e.g., patent document 2). However, such permeation enhancers simultaneously have problems of skin irritation and the like, and are insufficient in terms of safety. Also, the sensory feel thereof is not good. Therefore, conventional permeation enhancers are not sufficiently satisfactory for users.

The method utilizing the gene can be performed according to the method described in, for example, Y. Kikuchi et al., Applied microbiology and biotechnology 78, 67-74(2008), or S. Yamaguchi et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 268, 1410-1421 (2001). As protein-glutaminase, a commercially available product can also be used.

CBZ-Gln-Gly to be used as a substrate may be produced by a method known per se, or may be a commercially available product, or its production may be committed to an outside manufacture and the like. In the present invention, the above-mentioned protein-glutaminase is contained in a cosmetic composition.

In hair, for example, transglutaminase itself catalyzes a reaction between a free glutamine residue and a lysine residue mainly present in the hair outermost layer and forms a crosslink comprising a ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine bond as mentioned above, thus densifying the surface structure of the hair, improving damage hair, promoting water retaining function, is improving hair moisture retaining property and further exhibiting a damage hair improving effect to impart glossiness, flexibility and elasticity to the hair. In the present invention, by further combining the above-mentioned protein-glutaminase for, for example, hair, the hair is essentially improved and the strength (particularly, tensile strength) of the hair can be effectively increased. While transglutaminase in the present invention is not particularly limited, for example, one having an EC number (Enzyme Commission No.) of EC2.3.2.13 can be used. Transglutaminase is mainly present in various tissues and blood cells of animals. Therefore, transglutaminase used in the present invention can be isolated and purified from the liver, serum, platelet, epidermis and the like of mammals such as human, mouse, rat, guinea pig, swine, bovine, sheep and the like by a method known per se. In the present invention, moreover, not only transglutaminase derived from an animal but also, for example, transglutaminase derived from a microorganism such as Streptomyces mobaraensis and the like and plant-derived transglutaminase can be used irrespective of the origin thereof. As transglutaminase, a commercially available product can be preferably used, which can be obtained with ease, since it is commercially available widely in the field of, for example, food and the like. Transglutaminase to be used in the present invention may be produced by a genetic recombination method. While transglutaminase generally requires calcium ion for its reaction, calcium ion-independent transglutaminase is also present depending on the kind (e.g., JP-A-1-27471 etc.). Therefore, calcium ion may be added to the composition of the present invention where necessary, though not essentially. Examples of the compound capable of supplying calcium ion in the present invention include calcium chloride, calcium sulfate, is and calcium bromide and the like. Of these, calcium chloride is preferable. The amount thereof to be added is generally 1-20 mM, preferably 3-10 mM, in calcium concentration.

The content is preferably not more than 2 mass %, more preferably not more than 1 mass %, further preferably not more than 0.5 mass %. When transglutaminase is contained in the above-mentioned ranges, it can effectively improve the strength of the hair in combination with a protein-glutaminase. In the cosmetic composition of the present invention, the mixing ratio of the protein-glutaminase and transglutaminase (protein-glutaminase:transglutaminase (mass:mass)) is not necessarily limited by the titer and the like of the both enzymes; however, it is preferably 1:1-1:10000, more preferably 1:2-1:1000, further preferably 1:10-1:100.

The appearance of the protein hydrophilicity-increasing agent of the present invention is not particularly limited, and can be any appropriate appearance, for example, transparent, white turbid, pearl-like and the like. The cosmetic composition of the present invention is not particularly limited, and specific examples thereof include hair cosmetics, such as perming agent, hair color, hair-growth medicine, hair-growth drug, hair cream, hair lotion, hair serum, hair milk, hair ointment, hair treatment, hair conditioner, shampoo, rinse and the like, skin cosmetics such as facial wash, skin lotion, skin milk, cream, gel, serum, facial mask, mask, soap, body shampoo, face powder, foundation, lip color, blush, eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, eyebrow pencil and the like, and the like. The effects of the cosmetic composition of the present invention explained above are attributable to the action specific to protein-glutaminase that the hydrophilicity of protein in a tissue (e.g., hair, skin etc.) can be improved without damaging the tissue. This is assumed to be because protein-glutaminase probably has an action to convert a glutamine residue in a protein or peptide to a glutamic acid residue, and the conversion of amino acid is performed without cleaving the peptide bond in the protein or peptide. Thus, protein-glutaminase is useful since it increases hydrophilicity of protein in a tissue. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a protein hydrophilicity-increasing agent containing a protein-glutaminase. The protein of the “protein hydrophilicity-increasing agent” of the present invention means a protein constituting hair, skin, nail and the like of human. With the protein hydrophilicity-increasing effect, permeation of an active ingredient contained in the composition to a tissue (e.g., hair, skin etc.) can be enhanced. Therefore, the present invention further provides an (active ingredient) permeation enhancer containing a protein-glutaminase. The above-mentioned protein hydrophilicity-increasing agent and the permeation enhancer are collectively referred hereafter to as “the agent of the present invention”. The agent of the present invention is useful not only as a cosmetic but also as a medicament, where the application target is mammal (e.g., human, mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, cat, dog, bovine, sheep, monkey etc.). The application target of the agent of the present invention is preferably human. For application to a mammal other than human, the dose of the agent of the present invention can be appropriately reduced according to the body weight or size of the animal. When the agent of the present invention is used as a medicament, the administration method thereof is not particularly limited; however, parenteral administration is preferable and transdermal administration is particularly preferable from the aspects of the effect thereof. While the dosage form of the agent of the present invention is not particularly limited, it is preferably external preparation (e.g., external solid agent (external powder etc.), external liquid (liniment, lotion etc.), spray (external aerosol, pump spray etc.), ointment, cream, gel, adhesive preparation (tape, cataplasm etc.) and the like). The agent of the present invention can be produced by a method conventionally used in the technical field of preparation formulation, for example, the method described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia and the like. The agent of the present invention may be the above-mentioned protein-glutaminase itself, or formulated by blending with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, when necessary for formulation. While the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is not particularly limited, for example, aqueous carrier, milky carrier, gel-like carrier, cream base, ointment base and the like can be mentioned. Specific examples thereof include oily ingredients such as animal and vegetable fats and oils, waxes, fatty acid, aliphatic alcohol, ester oils, hydrocarbon oils, silicone oils and the like; surfactants such as nonionic surfactant, anionic surfactant, amphoteric surfactant, cationic surfactant and the like; lower alcohols such as ethanol and the like; polyvalent alcohols such as glycerin, 1,3-butanediol and the like; thickeners such as carboxyvinyl polymer, hydroxycellulose and the like; pH adjusters such as lactic acid and a salt thereof, citric acid and a salt thereof and the like; bases such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, L-arginine and the like; antioxidants such as tocopherol and a derivative thereof and the like; UV inhibitor, antimicrobial/antifungal agent, flavor, dye, pigment and the like, ingredients generally used in the medicament field and the like. The content of protein-glutaminase in the agent of the present invention when formulated using a carrier is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately adjusted to contain protein-glutaminase in an amount necessary for affording the effect of the present invention. While the content of protein-glutaminase varies depending on the kind of the dosage form and the kind of the carrier to be used, it is, for example, 0.1-30 mass %, preferably 0.5-20 mass %, more preferably 1-20 mass %, further preferably 1-10 mass %. While the dose of the agent of the present invention varies depending on the subject of administration, target organ, symptom, administration method and the like, when it is parenterally administered to human, for example, the mass of protein-glutaminase for an adult (body weight 60 kg) is about 0.01-10 mg, preferably about 0.1-5 mg, more preferably 1-4 mg, per day. When the subject of administration is other than human, an amount based on that for body weight 60 kg can be administered. Alternatively, an appropriate dose may be set for the subject of administration. In the present invention, the above-mentioned daily dose can be administered once or in 2-4, preferably 2-3, portions as necessary at appropriate intervals. The agent of the present invention can be used in combination with, for example, the aforementioned transglutaminase, amino acid or a salt thereof, acylamino acid, an ester or amide thereof, or a salt thereof, peptide or a salt thereof, acylpeptide or a salt thereof, alcohol, and efficacy ingredients conventionally used for cosmetics and the like. Also, the agent of the present invention can be used in combination with the active ingredients generally used for external preparations, from the aspects of the effect thereof. In the present specification, the “combined use” means use of the agent of the present invention before or simultaneously with or after the administration of the above-mentioned various ingredients, and also includes use of a mixture of the both as an additive. The administration form thereof is not limited as long as both the agent of the present invention and the above-mentioned various ingredients are used, and the effect of the above-mentioned various ingredients is enhanced. EXAMPLES The present invention is explained in more detail in the following by referring to Examples; however, the present invention is not limited by the following Examples. 1. Preparation of Protein-Glutaminase Solution and Transglutaminase Solution A protein-glutaminase solution was prepared according to the method described in Y. Kikuchi et al., Applied microbiology and biotechnology 78, 67-74 (2008). That is, an expression plasmid was prepared by using a gene encoding a protein-glutaminase of Chryseobacterium proteolyticum (polynucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 3), and introduced into. Corynebacterium glutamicum to allow for secretory-expression of the protein-glutaminase, which was activated by protease, purified and dissolved in phosphate buffer. A transglutaminase solution was prepared by purifying transglutaminase, obtained from a culture supernatant of Streptomyces mobaraense, according to the method described in K. Yokoyama et al., Protein Expression and Purification 26 329-335 (2002), and dissolving same in phosphate buffer. 2. Measurement of Swelling Degree Hair was immobilized in a concave part of a glass slide for biochemical count having a depth of the concave part of 200 μm (manufactured by NIPPON Genetics Co, Ltd.), a cover glass was placed on the glass slide to cover the concave part, the diameter of the hair was measured 10-14 times, and the mean thereof was calculated (D0). Thereafter, a sample was injected from the clearance between the cover glass and the glass slide, and left standing for 3 min or 5 min. The diameter of the hair was measured 10-14 times, and the mean was calculated (D1). As the sample, ion exchange water, phosphate buffer (pH 6.2), protein-glutaminase solution (6.2 mg/mL, pH 6.2) and 1% aqueous ammonia (pH 11.8) were used. The swelling degree was calculated from the measured diameters of the hair (D0 and D1) according to the following formula. [in-line-formulae]swelling degree (%)=(D1−D0)/D0×100[/in-line-formulae] The results are shown in Table 1 and FIG. 1. TABLE 1 Comparative Comparative Comparative Example 1 Example 1 Example 2 Example 3 test protein- ion phosphate 1% aqueous solution glutaminase exchange buffer ammonia solution water (pH 6.2) (pH 11.8) (6.2 mg/mL, pH 6.2) swelling 10.4 9.4 6.3 11.1 degree (%) after 3 min swelling 11.1 8.9 6.2 11.3 degree (%) after 5 min From the results of Table 1 and FIG. 1, the swelling degree of the hair of Example 1 (protein-glutaminase solution) was higher than that of Comparative Example 1 (ion exchange water) and Comparative Example 2 (phosphate buffer) in both 3 min later and 5 min later, and of the same level as that of aqueous ammonia conventionally used as a hair swelling agent. 3. Observation of Hair Damage In the test of the above-mentioned 1, the condition of the hair 3 min after injection of ion exchange water, protein-glutaminase solution, or 1% aqueous ammonia was observed. Microscopic images of the hair subjected to various samples (magnification: ×400) are shown in FIG. 2. As a result, cuticles on the hair surface were lifted when aqueous ammonia was used (Comparative Example 3). When protein-glutaminase was used (Example 1), the hair surface was not damaged at all, like the use of ion exchange water (Comparative Example 1). From the results of the above-mentioned 1 and 2, it has been clarified that the protein-glutaminase effectively swells hair without damaging the hair. 4. Evaluation of Response of Protein-Glutaminase to Perm-Treated Hair <1> Preparation of Perm-Treated Hair Hair of Japanese women in their 20's was perm-treated and used as an experiment sample. The perm treatment included 1) immersing the hair in first perm liquid at 33° C. for 15 min and rinsing the first liquid with tap water at 35-40° C., and 2) immersing the hair in second perm liquid at 33° C. for 15 min and sufficiently rinsing same with tap water at 35-40° C. The continuous operation of 1) and 2) was repeated 4 times, and the hair was washed with 15% sodium laureth sulfate (EMAL E27C; Kao Corporation) and sufficiently rinsed with tap water at 35 -40° C. The hair was immersed in a buffer, and treated with occasional stirring at room temperature for 10 min. The hair was combed out, hung while avoiding overlapped hair, and dried in a thereto-hygrostat room (23° C., 40% R.H.). The first perm liquid, second perm liquid, and buffer used are as described below. TABLE 2 first perm liquid: ingredient name amount (mass %) ammonium thioglycolate (50%) 14 aqueous ammonia (28%) 2 monoethanolamine 2 purified water balance total 100 TABLE 3 second perm liquid: ingredient name amount (mass %) sodium bromate 6 purified water 94 total 100 buffer: 40 mM phosphoric acid, 40 mM acetic acid, 40 mM boric acid, sodium hydroxide, pH 4.5 <2> Quantification of Amount of Free Ammonia Produced Using an Ammonia test kit (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), the amount of free ammonia produced by reaction of protein-glutaminase with the above-mentioned perm-treated hair was quantified. The protein-glutaminase solution (2 ml) at a concentration shown in Table 4 was added to a bundle of the above-mentioned perm-treated hair (0.25 g), and the amount of ammonia in a sample after reaction at 37° C. for 1 hr was measured. The results are shown in Table 4 and FIG. 3. The amount of ammonia produced was shown as a value after subtraction of the amount of ammonia produced without addition of protein-glutaminase (Comparative Example 4). TABLE 4 Com- parative Example 4 Example 2 Example 3 Example 4 Example 5 protein- 0.00 0.01 0.05 0.10 1.00 glutaminase solution (mg/ml) amount of 0.00 0.12 0.40 0.40 1.28 ammonia produced (ug/ml) From Table 4, protein-glutaminase reacted with perm-treated hair when the protein-glutaminase solution had a concentration of not less than 0.01 mg/ml. 5. Evaluation of Improved Permeability of Active Ingredient (Transglutaminase) to Hair by Protein-Glutaminase SOLUTION A (2 ml) shown in Table 5 was added to a bundle of the above-mentioned perm-treated hair (5 g), and the hair was wrapped with Saran Wrap (registered trade mark) (manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation) to allow for reaction at 37° C. for 30 min. After the reaction, the hair was washed twice by shaking in ultrapure water (30 sec each). Thereafter, SOLUTION B (2 ml) shown in Table 5 was added, and the hair was wrapped with Saran Wrap to allow for reaction at 37° C. for 30 min. After the reaction, the hair was washed twice by shaking in ultrapure water (30 sec each), and air-dried. The protein-glutaminase solution and transglutaminase solution used as SOLUTION A and SOLUTION B were adjusted to pH 6.0 with phosphate buffer. Ten hairs were collected from each hair bundle after the reaction, and the long diameter and short diameter of each hair were measured by a laser micrometer (LS-7010MR: manufactured by Keyence Corporation). Thereafter, using a tensile tester (KES-G1: manufactured by Kato Tech Co., ltd.), the tensile strength of the hair was measured in pure water (measured length 40 mm). From the measurement values of the short diameter, long diameter and tensile strength, the strength of one hair with a long diameter of 80 pm and a short diameter of 80 μm was calculated, and the mean of the measurement results of 10 hairs was compared. The results are shown in Table 5. TABLE 5 Comparative Comparative Example 6 Example 7 Example 5 Example 6 SOLUTION A protein- protein- phosphate phosphate glutaminase glutaminase buffer buffer solution solution (0.02 mg/ml) (0.01 mg/ml) SOLUTION B transglutaminase transglutaminase phosphate transglutaminase solution solution buffer solution (1 mg/ml) (1 mg/ml) (1 mg/ml) pH 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 tensile 18.2 18.4 13.2 15.8 strength (gf/p) As shown in Comparative Example 5 and Comparative Example 6, the tensile strength of the perm-treated hair increased from 13.2 (gf/p) to 15.8 (gf/p) by the application of transglutaminase. The results show that transglutaminase permeated to and reacted with the hair, and increased the strength. By comparison of Examples 6 and 7 with a treatment with protein-glutaminase in advance, and Comparative Example 6, the tensile strength increased from 15.8 (gf/p) to 18.2, 18.4 (gf/p). The results show that protein-glutaminase improves permeation level of transglutaminase, and the improved reactiveness of transglutaminase increases the strength. From these results, it could be confirmed that protein-glutaminase improved permeability of transglutaminase, which is the active ingredient for hair strength, to the hair. 6. Evaluation of Improved Permeability of Active Ingredient (Hair Conditioner) to Hair by Protein-Glutaminase 1 g of hair (hair (normal hair) of Japanese women in their 20′s and the above-mentioned perm-treated hair) was washed 3 times with 50 ml of phosphate buffer for 5 min. Then, each hair was immersed in 4 ml of protein-glutaminase solution (2 mg/ml) in Example 8 and Example 9, each hair was immersed in 4 ml of phosphate buffer in Comparative Example 7 and Comparative Example 8, and both were reacted at 37° C. for 30 min. Each hair after the reaction was washed 3 times with 50 ml of phosphate buffer for 5 min, washed with water and air dried. 0.5 g of hair conditioner (“Propoline” hair conditioner camomile & honey, manufactured by APIVITA) was applied to 1 g of hair for 30 sec, rinsed with tap water (running water) at 40° C. for 30 sec, and air dried in a thermo-hygrostat room (25° C., 40% R.H.). The hair after drying was subjected to sensory evaluation of moist feeling, smoothness, absence of dry feeling of hair tip ends, and manageability of hair tip ends by five men and women by rating as follows. <Moist Feeling> 2 points: strong moist feeling 1 point: moist feeling 0 point: no moist feeling −1 point: feel dry <Smoothness> 2 point: very smooth 1 point: smooth 0 point: no smoothness −1 point: feel roughness <Absence of Dry Feeling of Hair Tip Ends> 2 point: completely no dry feeling of hair tip ends 1 point: no dry feeling of hair tip ends 0 point: somewhat dry hair tip ends −1 point: very dry feeling of hair tip ends <Manageability of Hair Tip Ends> 2 point: Very manageable hair tip ends 1 point: manageable hair tip ends 0 point: somewhat less manageability of hair tip ends −1 point: completely no manageability of hair tip ends For evaluation, the grades of 5 panelists were totaled, 10-8 total points were marked with ⊙, 7-5 points were marked with ◯, 4-0 points were marked with Δ, and −1-−5 points were marked with x. The results are shown in Table 6. TABLE 6 Compar. Compar.

These are the results of the treatment with a protein-glutaminase solution, which increased hydrophilicity of hair surface, increased adsorption of conditioning ingredients (stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, behentrimonium chloride, quaternium-80) and caused permeation of the active ingredient (panthenol) of the hair conditioner to the hair. The components of the hair conditioner (“Propoline” hair conditioner camomile & honey, manufactured by APIVITA) used are as described below. water, cetanol, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, behentrimonium chloride, cetyl esters, quaternium-80, fragrance, citric acid, BG, ceteareth-12, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, panthenol, glycerin, potassium sorbate, hydrolyzed oats, tocopherol acetate, tocopherol, honey extract, camomilla recutita flower extract, gossypium herbaceum extract, rosmarumus officinalis leaf extract, butylphenyl methylpropanal, salvia officinalis leaf extract, hypericum perforatum flower/leaf/stem extract, coumarin, α-glucan oligosaccharide, Salvia sclarea oil, citrus aurantium dulcis peel oil 7. Evaluation of Improved Permeability of Active Ingredient (Peptide) to Skin by Protein-Glutaminase Using glycylglycylglycine (hereinafter indicated as “Gly-Gly-Gly”) (manufactured by PEPTIDE INSTITUTE, INC.) as a peptide to be evaluated for skin permeability, the permeability of Gly-Gly-Gly to commercially available artificial cultured skin (3D cultured human skin model: TESTSKIN LSE-high, manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.) was evaluated. Gly-Gly-Gly was labeled with fluorescein by using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-I, manufactured by Chemical-Dojin Co., Ltd.) to enable highly sensitive detection. The cultured skin is cultured on a polycarbonate membrane on the bottom of a transwell, and set on a 6-well assay plate. Phosphate buffer (−) (1.2 ml) was added to the assay plate to soak the bottom part (corium side) of the cultured skin. An assay ring was mounted on the top (corneum side) of the cultured skin, FITC-labeled Gly-Gly-Gly sample was added and incubated for a given time period. The permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount of FITC-labeled Gly-Gly-Gly that permeated the cultured skin to move into phosphate buffer (-). First, a protein-glutaminase solution (4 mg/ml, 100 μl) was added to the top of the cultured skin and incubated at 37° C. for 30 min, after which a FITC-labeled Gly-Gly-Gly sample (100 μl) was added to the top of the cultured skin. After 2, 5, and 20 hr, the amount of FITC-labeled Gly-Gly-Gly that permeated the cultured skin and moved into phosphate buffer (−) was measured. As a comparison target, phosphate buffer (−) was added to the top of the cultured skin instead of a protein-glutaminase solution. The fluorescence intensity was measured under the conditions of exciting wavelength 492 nm and fluorescence wavelength 520 nm. The fluorescence intensity was measured using platereader SpectraMaxM2 (manufactured by Molecular Devices, LLC.). The results thereof are shown in FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 4, it was clarified that a treatment of cultured skin with protein-glutaminase improved permeability of peptide more than when untreated cultured skin was used. The results suggest that human skin reacted with protein-glutaminase shows enhanced hydrophilicity of corneum, and improved permeability of hydrophilic substances such as amino acid, peptide and the like to the skin. Since amino acid, peptide and the like (including the aforementioned acylamino acid, acylpeptide and derivatives thereof) can be an active ingredient for the skin and hair depending on the kind, use thereof in combination with protein-glutaminase is considered to be extremely useful for the skin and hair. 8.
