FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to marinades and, more particularly, to marinades that contain natural metabolite salts and, optionally, peptides, polypeptides, and phospholipids, all derived through fermentation of cultured sugars to improve cook yield, juiciness, flavor, and color in meat and seafood. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Animal protein-containing food products, primarily meat and seafood, are commonly treated with marinades. Conventional marinades include, inter alia, salt, spices, acids, starches and gums which help extend the shelf life of marinated meat and seafood. In addition to extending shelf life, marinating meats and seafood may improve their flavor and tenderness after the marinated meat and seafood is cooked, producing an enhanced eating experience. Additives such as phosphates have been used in the past in marinades to increase the moisture retention of marinated meats and seafood to further enhance the tenderness, juiciness and yield of the products. Unfortunately, however, the use of phosphates is unpopular because their use increases the phosphorus content of food processing plant effluents and, most importantly, because they are chemically synthesized rather than formed in nature and therefore are not "natural". Since consumers widely believe that natural food ingredients are healthier than chemically synthesized ingredients, the use of phosphates in foods is avoided where possible. Therefore, there is a substantial need for marinades that improve cook yield, juiciness, flavor and color in meat and seafood using only natural ingredients. The present invention makes such a marinade possible by providing the functionality of phosphates in the form of a yield additive that contains natural metabolite salts and, optionally, peptides, polypeptides, and phospholipids, all derived through fermentation of sugars. "Butter milk herb marinade" prior art document published 23rd October 2006 (referenced XP002632966) discloses a marinade comprising butter milk and various seasoning and flavourings. Other prior art marinades are disclosed in JP 9000209, WPI World Patent Information Derwent - XP002145439 and WO 02/24003. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a marinade for meat and seafood as defined in claim 1. The present invention further provides a method as defined in claim 4. In order to aid in understanding the invention, it will now be described in connection with exemplary embodiments thereof and with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Figures 1 and 2 are graphs of cook yield referenced in Example 1. The key active ingredients of the present invention are a combination of natural metabolites (organic acids) produced by fermenting milk sugars, whey sugars, dextrose or other suitable sugars with one or more food grade bacterial cultures. For example proprionicbacterium species can be applied to mil, whey, dextrose or other suitable sugars to produce as metabolites primarily acetic acid, succinic acid, and propionic acid. The fermentation culture may also include yeast extracts, protein hydrolytes or other protein-containing stimulants. Also, buffers, acids, salts, and other processing aids may be included to facilitate metabolite production. After the proprionicbacterium is developed up to an appropriate level of cells per ml, the growth culture can be heated to kill the inoculated bacteria prior to use of the metabolites (or their derivatives) and other components in marinades. The fermentation process will be tailored so that most of the naturally occurring metabolites produced are organic acids. These organic acids preferably are subsequently converted to organic salts. The resulting composition (including optionally peptides, polypeptides and phospholipids present in the growth culture) is a natural marinade additive that improves cook yield and juiciness, as well as flavor, and colour in meat and seafood. Therefore it is generally referred to below as a "yield additive. In addition, one or more phospholipids that are a natural component of the bacterial cell membranes also may be present in the yield additive. These phospholipids are believed to have a positive effect on yield due to the hydrophilic polar portion of the phospholipid structure, and possibly also due to the emulsifying or fat binding properties of the lipophilic section of the phospholipid structure. We do not, however, intend to be bound by this theory of operation. Lactic acid bacteria may be used to also generate and thereby contribute polysaccharides (xanthan gum or similar polysaccharides) to the yield additive through fermentation of the starting sugars. When present, these polysaccharides are believed to also contribute to the functionality of the yield additive. In summary, the use of the fermentation-derived yield additives in marinades unexpectedly produces outstanding cook yield, juiciness, flavor, and color in marinated meat and seafood. Table I below lists the compositions of four yield additive samples YA-1 to YA-4, that may be used in the practice of this invention as demonstrated in the Examples. These yield additive samples are produced by fermenting dextrose by applying proprionicbacterium species and one or more other bacterial species and converting the organic acids produced to their salt form.

They have not previously been used in connection with meat or seafood for the purpose of improving cook yield, juiciness, flavor or color. Indeed, the low pH characteristics of the material (particularly the pH 7.84 of YA-1 of Table 1) would suggest to one of ordinary skill in the art that these materials are not viable candidates for marinades to improve cook yield since such materials typically have a pH of at least about pH 9-10. Yet, as shown in the Examples, the YA-1 composition, which has the lowest pH of the four yield additives examined, produces the best improvement in cook yield. (See Table III.) Currently preferred yield additives include primarily combinations of the following organic salts: acetate, propionate, lactate, and succinate. The actual levels of the acetate, propionate and succinate may be tailored by adjusting the parameters of the fermentation process including, culture(s), food source (type and quantity of sugar available to metabolize), temperature and oxygen content during generally anaerobic stages of the fermentation process to produce the corresponding organic acids which are then converted to the salt form. Low levels (about 1-2 percent by weight) of citrate and tartrate salts (derived from citric acid and tartaric acid) may also be present as a fixed byproduct of the fermentation process. Also, in some applications the fermentation parameters may be adjusted to provide and produce fumaric and/or other organic acids in the yield additives. Conversion of the organic acids to the salt form is accomplished by reacting the fermentation-produced acids with appropriate bases (e.g., NaOH, CaOH, KOH, or Mg(OH)2,). The currently preferred salts are sodium and potassium salts produced by reaction with NaOH or KOH although salts produced by reaction with Mg(OH)2 and CaOH may be used. When present, fumaric or other organic acids may similarly be converted to their salt forms. Examples of useful organic salt combinations include: 1234567Lactate✔✔✔✔Succinate✔✔✔✔✔Acetate✔✔✔✔✔✔Propionate✔✔✔✔✔✔Citrate✔✔Tartrate✔✔ Also, concentrations of these salts will produce synergistic results in terms of cook yield, juiciness, flavor and color. Among preferred ratios are examples 9, 10 and 12 of the following: The marinades of the invention may contain, in addition to the yield additive, functional ingredients as follows on an as delivered basis: Other Functional IngredientsBroad Percentages by Weight*Preferred Percentages by Weight*NaCl0.1 - 3.00.5 - 1.5Spices0.01 - 3.00.1 - 1.0Starches0.0 - 2.00.5 - 1.0Gums0.0 - 1.00.001 - 0.4* Balance typically will be water. Marinades containing the yield additives of this invention (as well as other functional ingredients commonly found in marinades as noted above) will be applied by tumbling (preferably in a vacuum), by injection, by massage, by soaking, or by combinations of these application techniques. The marinades will be applied at levels sufficient to achieve pick-up in the marinated meat or seafood of 0.01 to 2.0 percent by weight yield additive based on the weight of the meat or seafood substrate and preferably will be delivered to achieve pick-up at a level sufficient to achieve pick-up in the marinated meat or seafood of 0.10 to 0.50% by weight yield additive. The balance will be the other functional additives and water. EXAMPLES Example 1 An aqueous marinade stock solution was formulated to deliver on a weight basis 0.5% salt and .013% of gums. A series of marinades were made using the stock solution by adding sufficient levels of YA-1, YA-2, YA-3, and YA-4 to deliver these yield additives at levels of 1.0% (high), 0.5% (medium), and 0.25% (low), respectively. In all cases, the yield additives included fermentation-derived peptides and polypeptides as well as phospholipids present in the spent bacterial cell membranes. These marinade compositions are listed in Table II below.

Next, three sets of test samples comprising four ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts were prepared by injecting with each of the marinades at a level of 20% weight based on the weight of the chicken breasts. The breasts were then individually vacuum-sealed and refrigerated. After two days, one set of test samples was removed from the vacuum pouches and baked in an oven at 204°C (400°F) to an internal temperature of 77°C (170°F) and screened by a sensory panel. The sensory panel was a group of four individuals trained to evaluate, compare, and quantify organoleptic characteristics of food. Each member of the panel previously completed a minimum of 120 hours of descriptive analysis training. The panelists met prior to the initial evaluations of the test products to develop the terminology and ballot used in the study. Sensory data was continuously monitored and collected. The next day, the remaining two sets of samples were steamed in the vacuum pouches at 100°C (212°F) to an internal temperature of 77°C (170°F) and again screened by the same sensory panel. Cook Yield Cook yield data for the baked samples is attached and plotted in Graph I of Figure 1 and listed in Table III below. Table IIIBAKEDgreen wt.

The remaining marinades containing the yield additives improved "baked" cook yield at a level comparable to that obtained using 0.5% phosphates at 0.25% or 1.0%. The dip in cook yield of the 0.5% "medium" marinades is unexpected and believed to be an error. If disregarded, the cook yield was independent of the yield additive concentration between 0.25 and 1.0% when the chicken breast was baked.

However, the data for the remaining samples showed that cook yield increased with increasing yield additive concentration in a linear fashion. The YA increased steamed sample cook yield to a degree comparable to that obtained using the inorganic phosphates. (STPP and TPPP) Sensory Results The sensory panelists indicated that the high levels of YA-1, YA-2, YA-3 and YA-4 produced off-flavors. This can and will be remedied in commercial practice by adjusting the levels of the organic salts to produce the optimal balance between functionality and flavor profile. For example, the level of acetate, which produces acceptable flavor notes and improves yield, may be increased and the level of proprionate, which produces less desirable flavor notes, may be decreased. It should also be noted that comments on the medium and low levels of YA-1, YA-2, YA-3 and YA-4 varied as to the off flavors. Most importantly, all medium and low levels of yield additives were found to be acceptable by some panelists. Conclusions Cook yield and sensory panel data support the use of the yield additives of the invention as a phosphate replacer to improve cook yield. The data also shows that the cooking process (i.e., baking vs. steaming in bag) can play a significant part in the effectiveness of marinades containing the yield additives tested and other yield additives in accordance with the invention. Example 2 This example examined the contribution of marinades containing organic acid salts similar to those present in the yield additives of Example 1, but in the absence of the fermentation-derived peptides and polypeptides as well as phospholipids present in the spent bacterial cell membranes. The cook yield results are reported in the following Tables VI-VIII.

As a result, it is believed that the yield additives of the invention can be used at levels of 0.25% or less which will reduce costs and minimize any flavor off-notes. Additionally, an analogue to YA-1 containing no peptides, polypeptides or phospholipids was made up from sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium succinate, sodium citrate and tartrate as set forth in Table IX below.

The respective cook yields were 86.81% for YA-1 and 83.77% for the YA-1 analogue. This highlights the finding that marinades containing the organic acid salts alone (i.e., in the absence of the peptides/polypeptides or phospholipids), at the same level as found in the marinades containing the yield additive compositions, are not as effective as the yield additive compositions, thereby establishing the contribution of the polypeptides, peptides and phospholipids. Example 3 The objective of this example was to determine if the yield additives of the invention can replace sodium tripolyphosphate as a natural yield enhancer on a taste basis. In order to do this a sensory panel of six was convened to determine if the panelists could detect a difference in juiciness compared to a control sodium tripolyphosphate sample and if any off flavor characteristics are perceived. Samples A - N were prepared as set forth in Table X.
