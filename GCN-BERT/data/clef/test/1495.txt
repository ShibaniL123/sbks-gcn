Step 2: 5-cyclopropylsulfonylisoindoline hydrochloride
5-cyclopropylsulfonyl-2-tert-butoxycarbonylisoindoline (2.30 g, 7.1 mmol) was dissolved in methanol/dichloromethane (1:1, 40 mL), purged with hydrogen chloride gas until saturation, and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. After the resuting mixture was poured into 250 mL ethyl ether, the precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with ethyl ether and dried to give the product 5-cyclopropylsulfonylisoindoline hydrochloride (1.85 g). Yield: 100%.
