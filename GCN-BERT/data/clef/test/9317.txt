All-Shape building blocks may be modified to include a flange on each tetrahedron edge, where each flange and each tetrahedron vertex may include magnetic materials (e.g., magnets, ferromagnetic metals). All-Shape building blocks may be combined to form or give the appearance of various geometric structures, and the included magnetic materials may be used to retain the formed geometric structure shape. In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments which may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following description of example embodiments is, therefore, not to be taken in a limited sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims. FIG. 1 is a perspective view 100 of an All-Shape building block. An example tetrahedron is formed of four triangular faces, and may be thought of as a triangular pyramid. Each tetrahedron includes four vertices, and includes six edges. Each of the triangular faces may be formed using an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle, provided that the triangular faces meet to form the four vertices and six edges. FIG. 2 is a front view 200 of a circular face of an All-Shape building block. The face in FIG. 2 is shown as a circle 210, though ellipsoid or other shapes may be used. The circular face 210 may be made of a transparent material, and may be of a uniform or nonuniform thickness. For example, the cross-section of the circular face 210 may be convex or concave, and may be used as a lens in various optical applications. The circular face 210 may include various color patterns. The circular face 210 may circumscribe a triangle 220, such as a triangular face of a tetrahedron. The triangle may be comprised of three one hundred and twenty degree angles, such as in an equilateral triangle. Various additional ornamental designs may be used on each side of the circular face 210, and may include a straight line on each side of the circumscribed triangle 220. The straight line may be a projection of the triangle edge, where two such lines at a triangle vertex form a one hundred and twenty degree angle. Various designs may include lines comprised of magnetic tape, where information may be encoded or transferred using the magnetic tape. For example, standard magnetic tape encoders and readers may be used to record or read information encoded on a magnetic tape stripe on an exterior surface. Various designs may include lines comprised of electrically conductive materials, such as copper. The circular face 210 may be constructed using a flexible material to allow the three portions of the circular face extending beyond the inscribed triangle to be folded toward the viewer to form flanges 232, 234, and 236. In another embodiment, the circular face 210 and flanges 232, 234, and 236 are constructed using a semi-flexible or inflexible material and connected at each triangle edge using a hinge, where the hinge may be constructed using a flexible material or a mechanical hinge. The flanges of four such circular faces may be connected to form an All-Shape building block, such as is shown in FIG. 3. FIG. 3 is a perspective view 300 of an All-Shape building block. The All-Shape building block includes four connected circular faces. The flanges of four such circular faces are connected to form All-Shape flanges 310, 312, 316, 318, and 320. The triangles inscribed in each of the four connected circular faces form a tetrahedral inner space 330. The All-Shape flanges 310, 312, 316, 318, and 320 define a spherical volume that corresponds with the circumscribed sphere (e.g., circumsphere) surrounding the tetrahedral inner space 330. The All-Shape building block may be transparent, may be translucent, may include a semi-transparent material comprised of a color, or may include a solid (e.g., opaque) material. The tetrahedral inner space 330 may include one or more gasses, such as noble gasses or gasses that are translucent or colored. The tetrahedral inner space 330 may include one or more fluids, such as a suspended particle fluid that transitions from a clouded appearance to a translucent appearance in the presence of an electrical voltage. Various levels of transparency or various shades of color may be used for the each side of the tetrahedral inner space 330 or for each of the All-Shape flanges 310, 312, 316, 318. The use of semi-transparent materials of various colors may allow the colors to be combined depending on orientation. For example, if the device is held so a blue face is superimposed on a yellow face, the object may appear green. Similarly, multiple All-Shape building blocks may be combined to yield various colors. Multiple All-Shape building blocks may be combined to form the appearance of various platonic solids, where the platonic solid appearance may depend on each All-Shape building block's specific periodicities of motion and wave positions in time as indicated by the direction of particular intersecting linear projections. For example, the vertices of four All-Shape building blocks using tetrahedral configurations may be combined to form a larger tetrahedron, where the larger tetrahedron maintains the one hundred and twenty degree angle at each of its vertices. The All-Shape building block may alter its appearance based on the presence of electrical current. For example, using electrochemical materials, application of an electrical current may transition one or more surfaces of the All-Shape building block to translucent, clouded, or colored. A solid All-Shape building block may be used to conduct vibration, such as in acoustic or other applications. For example, induced mechanical vibration may be used in vibration therapy. The All-Shape building block may be constructed using a conductive material for various electrical applications. For example, one or more of the faces of the All-Shape building block may be comprised of silicon, where the silicon is arranged to function as a resistor, inductor, capacitor, microchip (e.g., integrated circuit), or other electrical component. FIG. 4 is a front view 400 of magnetic material placement within the circular face of the All-Shape building block. Each face may include magnetic material within each of six locations 410, 412, 416, 418, and 420. In some embodiments, each of six locations 410, 412, 416, 418, and 420 may form vacant spaces when four circular faces are connected to form an All-Shape building block. For example, flange locations 412, 414, and 420 may form disc-shaped vacant spaces, and vertex locations 410, 416, and 418 may form smaller tetrahedron-shaped vacant spaces, such as is shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 5 is a perspective view 500 of an All-Shape building block with magnetic materials. The vertices of the tetrahedron may include four tetrahedron-shaped vacant spaces 512, 514, 516, 518 for retaining magnetic material. The tetrahedron-shaped vacant spaces 512, 514, 516, 518 may retain magnetic material in a fixed position, or may allow magnetic material to shift in response to attraction or repulsion from other magnetic materials. For example, a vertex from one All-Shape building block is brought in close proximity to a vertex from another All-Shape building block, the magnets within each vertex may reorient themselves such that the vertices attract and secure the vertices to each other. Similarly, the flanges of the circular faces may include six disc-shaped vacant spaces 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 for retaining magnetic material, which may retain magnetic material in a fixed position or allow magnetic material to shift in response to attraction or repulsion from other magnetic materials. The magnetic material may be used to arrange multiple All-Shape building blocks, or multiple non-magnetic blocks may be stacked, grouped in a pile, arranged on a flat surface, glued, or held together by any other means. The combination of the four tetrahedron-shaped vacant spaces 512, 514, 516, 518 and six disc-shaped vacant spaces 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 may be arranged to focus energy on a point within or external to the All-Shape building block. For example, the magnetic material may be arranged to create a positive magnetic polarity on two of the four faces of the All-Shape building block and a negative polarity on the other two faces. Similarly, when conductive material is used on or within the All-Shape building block, the magnetic material may be used to create a positive or negative polarity on a region of the All-Shape building block.
