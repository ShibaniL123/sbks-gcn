TECHNICAL FIELD This invention is in the field of protein expression. In particular, it relates to the expression of proteins from Neisseria (e.g. N.gonorrhoeae or, preferably, N.meningitidis). BACKGROUND ART References 1 and 2 disclose alternative and improved approaches for the expression of the Neisserial proteins disclosed in references 3 to 6. One such method is to produce 'hybrid' proteins in which two or more Neisserial proteins are expressed as a single polypeptide chain. This approach offers two advantages. First, a protein that may be unstable or poorly expressed on its own can be assisted by adding a suitable hybrid partner that overcomes the problem. Second, commercial manufacture is simplified as only one expression and purification need be employed in order to produce two separately-useful proteins. It is an object of the present invention to provide further alternative and improved approaches for the expression of Neisserial proteins. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Mixtures The invention provides a composition comprising the following proteins: (1) 961(2) NH2-A-[-X-L-]n-B-COOH, wherein n=2, X1=287,X2-953(3)NH2-A-[X-L-]n-B-COOH, wherein n=2, X1=936,X2=741 Proteins 287 and 741 are included in the mixture and they may be in the 'ΔG' form. Protein 961 is included and it is preferably in the form of '961c' in which the N-terminus leader and C-terminus membrane anchor are absent [e.g. see refs. 1, 2 & 10]. A preferred mixture comprises the following three proteins: (1) 961c, preferably 961c2996 (e.g. S EQ ID 31 herein);(2) NH2-A-[-X-L-]n-B-COOH, wherein n is 2, -X1- is ΔG287 (preferably ΔG287NZ), -X2- is 953 (preferably 9532996) lacking its leader peptide, -L1- is GSGGGG, and -A- comprises a N-terminus methionine (e.g. -A- is M or MA) (e.g. SEQ IDs 28 & 29 herein); and(3) NH2-A-[-X-L-]n-B-COOH, wherein n=2, X1=936 (preferably 9362996), X2=ΔG741 (preferably ΔG741MC58), L1=GSGGGG (e.g. SEQ ID 30 herein). The mixtures may also comprise N.meningitidis outer membrane vesicles. Hybrid proteins The hybrid proteins are joined such that they are translated as a single polypeptide chain and can be represented by the formula: NH2-A-[-X-L-]n-B-COOH wherein X is an amino acid sequence, L is an optional linker amino acid sequence, A is an optional N-terminal amino acid sequence, B is an optional C-terminal amino acid sequence, and n is an integer greater than 1. The value of n is 2. The -X- moieties The hybrid protein comprises a first -X- moiety (-Xa-) and a second -X- moiety (-Xb-). The -Xb-moiety is related to -Xn- such that: (i) -Xb- has sequence identity to -Xa, and/or (j) -Xb- comprises a fragment of -Xa-. The -Xa- and -Xb- moieties may be in either order from N-terminus to C-terminus. The degree of 'sequence identity' referred to above is greater than, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more, up to 100%. This includes mutants, homologs, orthologs, allelic variants etc. [e.g. see ref. 7]. Identity is preferably determined by the Smith-Waterman homology search algorithm as implemented in the MPSRCH program (Oxford Molecular), using an affine gap search with parameters gap open penalty=12 and gap extension penalty=1. Typically, 50% identity or more between two proteins is considered as an indication of functional equivalence. The 'fragment' referred to above should consist of least m consecutive amino acids from an amino acid sequence and, depending on the particular sequence, m is 7 or more (eg. 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200 or more). Preferably the fragment comprises an epitope from an amino acid sequence. Preferred fragments are those disclosed in references 8 and 9. Preferred fragments are C- and/or N-terminal truncations (e.g. Δ1-287, Δ2-287 etc.). Preferred sequences omit poly-glycine sequences. This has been found to aid expression [ref. 2]. Poly-glycine sequences can be represented as (Gly)g, where g≥3 (e.g. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more). If a - X- moiety includes a poly-glycine sequence in its wild-type form, it is preferred to omit this sequence in the hybrid proteins of the invention. This may be by disrupting or removing the (Gly)g - by deletion (e.g. CGGGGS→ CGGGS, CGGS, CGS or CS), by substitution (e.g. CGGGGS→ CGXGGS, CGXXGS, CGXGXS etc.), and/or by insertion (e.g. CGGGGS→ CGGXGGS, CGXGGGS, etc.). Deletion of (Gly)g is preferred, and deletion of the N-terminus portion of a protein up to and including the poly-glycine sequence (e.g. deletion of residues 1-32 in SEQ ID 1) is referred to herein as 'ΔG'. Poly-glycine omission is particularly useful for proteins 287 and 741 (ΔG287 and ΔG741 - references 1 & 2). Preferred fragments omit complete protein domains. This is particularly useful for protein 961 and 287. Once a protein has been notional divided into domains, fragments can omit one or more of these domains (e.g. 287B, 287C, 287BC, 961 c - reference 2; Figures 1 and 2 herein). 287 protein has been notionally split into three domains, referred to as A, B & C (see Figure 5 of reference 2). Domain B aligns with IgA proteases, domain C aligns with transferrin-binding proteins, and domain A shows no strong alignment with database sequences. An alignment of polymorphic forms of 287 is disclosed in reference 7. 961 protein has been notionally split into several domains (Figure 1). If a -X- moiety has a leader peptide sequence in its wild-type form, this may be included or omitted in the hybrid proteins of the invention. Where the leader peptide is omitted, this is a preferred example of an amino acid fragment sequence. In one embodiment, the leader peptides will be deleted except for that of the -X- moiety located at the N-terminus of the hybrid protein i.e. the leader peptide of X1 will be retained, but the leader peptides of X2 ... Xn will be omitted. This is equivalent to deleting all leader peptides and using the leader peptide of X1 as moiety -A-. Where 287 is used in full-length form, it is preferably at the C-terminal end of a hybrid protein; if it is to be used at the N-terminus, if is preferred to use a ΔG form of 287. Similarly, Where 741 is used in full-length form, it is preferably at the C-terminal end of a hybrid protein; if it is to be used at the N-terminus, if is preferred to use a ΔG form of 741. The -L- moieties For each n instances of [-X-L-], linker amino acid sequence -L- may be present or absent. When n=2 the hybrid may be NH2-X1-L1-X2-L2-COOH, NH2-X1-X2-COOH, NH2-X1-L1-X2-COOH, NH2-X1-X2-L2-COOH, etc. Linker amino acid sequence(s) -L- will typically be short (e.g. 20 or fewer amino acids i.e. 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). Examples include short peptide sequences which facilitate cloning, poly-glycine linkers (i.e. Glyn where n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more), and histidine tags (i.e. Hisn where n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more). Other suitable linker amino acid sequences will be apparent to those skilled in the art. A useful linker is GSGGGG (SEQ ID 27), with the Gly-Ser dipeptide being formed from a BamHI restriction site, thus aiding cloning and manipulation, and the Gly4 tetrapeptide being a typical poly-glycine linker. If Xn+1 is a ΔG protein and Ln is a glycine linker, this may be equivalent to Xn-1 not being a ΔG protein and Ln being absent. The A- moiety -A- is an optional N-terminal amino acid sequence. This will typically be short (e.g. 40 or fewer amino acids i.e. 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). Examples include leader sequences to direct protein trafficking, or short peptide sequences which facilitate cloning or purification (e.g. histidine tags i.e. Hisn where n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more). Other suitable N-terminal amino acid sequences will be apparent to those skilled in the art. If X1 lacks its own N-terminus methionine, -A-may be a methionine residue. The -B- moiety -B- is an optional C-terminal amino acid sequence. This will typically be short (e.g. 40 or fewer amino acids i.e. 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). Examples include sequences to direct protein trafficking, short peptide sequences which facilitate cloning or purification (e.g. comprising histidine tags i.e. Hisn where n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more), or sequences which enhance protein stability. Other suitable C-terminal amino acid sequences will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Polymorphic forms of proteins The invention can use amino acid sequences from any strains of N.meningitidis. References to a particular protein (e.g. '287', or 'ORF46.1') therefore include that protein from any strain. Reference sequences from N.meningitidis serogroup B include: ProteinReferenceProteinReferenceorf46Ref. 6, SEQ ID 1049961Ref. 5, SEQ ID 940953Ref. 5, SEQ ID 2918287Ref. 5, SEQ ID 3104741Ref. 5, SEQ ID 2536936Ref. 5, SEQ ID 2884919Ref. 5, SEQ ID 3070 Reference 7 discloses polymorphic forms of proteins ORF46, 287, 919 and 953. Polymorphic forms of 961 are disclosed in references 10 & 11. Any of these polymorphic forms of 287, 953 or 961 may be used in accordance with the present invention. Serogroups and strains Preferred proteins of the invention comprise -X- moieties having an amino acid sequence found in N.meningitidis serogroup B. Within a single protein of the invention, individual -X- moieties may be from one or more strains. For instance, X2 may be from the same strain as X1 or from a different strain. Within serogroup B, preferred -X- moieties are from strains 2996, MC58, 95N477, or 394/98. Strain 95N477 is sometimes referred to herein as 'ET37', this being its electrophoretic type. Strain 394/98 is sometimes referred to herein as `nz', as it is a New Zealand strain. Where a form of 287 is used, this is preferably from strain 2996 or from strain 394/98. Where a form of 741 is used, this is preferably from serogroup B strains MC58, 2996, 394/98, or 95N477, or from serogroup C strain 90/18311. Where a form of 961 is used, this is preferably from strain 2996. Strains are indicated as a subscript e.g. 741MC58 is protein 741 from strain MC58. Unless otherwise stated, proteins mentioned herein (e.g. with no subscript) are from N.meningitidis strain 2996, which can be taken as a 'reference' strain. It will be appreciated, however, that the invention is not in general limited by strain. As mentioned above, general references to a protein (e.g. '287', `919' etc.) may be taken to include that protein from any strain. This will typically have sequence identity to 2996 of 90% or more (eg. 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more). Heterologous host Whilst expression of the proteins of the invention may take place in Neisseria, the present invention preferably utilises a heterologous host. The heterologous host may be prokaryotic (e.g. a bacterium) or eukaryotic. It is preferably E.coli, but other suitable hosts include Bacillus subtilis, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonenna typhimurium, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria cinerea, Mycobacteria (e.g. M.tuberculosis), yeast etc. Vectors etc. Also disclosed herein are (a) nucleic acid encoding the proteins described above (b) vectors comprising these nucleic acid sequences (c) host cells containing said vectors. These compositions may be for use as medicaments (e.g. as vaccines) The invention includes the use of the compositions defined in the claims in the manufacture of a diagnostic reagent for detecting the presence of Neisserial bacteria or of antibodies raised against Neisseria bacteria, and/or a reagent which can raise antibodies against Neisseria bacteria. Implementing the invention will typically involve the basic steps of: obtaining a first nucleic acid encoding a first protein; obtaining a second nucleic acid encoding a second protein; and ligating the first and second nucleic acids. The resulting nucleic acid may be inserted into an expression vector, or may already be part of an expression vector. To improve solubility, purification of hybrid proteins may involve the refolding techniques disclosed herein. Immunogenic compositions and medicaments The compositions of the invention are preferably immunogenic composition, and are more preferably vaccine compositions. The pH of the composition is preferably between 6 and 7. The pH may be maintained by the use of a buffer. The composition may be sterile. Vaccines according to the invention may either be prophylactic (i.e. to prevent infection) or therapeutic (i.e. to treat infection), but will typically be prophylactic. The invention also provides a composition of the invention for use as a medicament or a diagnostic reagent. The medicament is preferably able to raise an immune response in a mammal (i.e. it is an immunogenic composition) and is more preferably a vaccine. The invention also provides the use of a composition of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for raising an immune response in a mammal. The medicament is preferably a vaccine. Also disclosed herein is a method for raising an immune response in a mammal comprising the step of administering an effective amount of the composition of the invention. The immune response is preferably protective. The method may raise a booster response. The mammal is preferably a human. Where the vaccine is for prophylactic use, the human is preferably a child (e.g. a toddler or infant); where the vaccine is for prophylactic use, the human is preferably an adult. A vaccine intended for children may also be administered to adults e.g. to assess safety, dosage, immunogenicity, etc. These uses and methods are preferably for the prevention and/or treatment of a disease caused by a Neisseria (e.g. meningitis, septicaemia, gonorrhoea etc.). The prevention and/or treatment of bacterial meningitis is preferred. Further components of the composition The composition of the invention will typically, in addition to the components mentioned above, comprise one or more 'pharmaceutically acceptable carriers', which include any carrier that does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition. Suitable carriers are typically large, slowly metabolised macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, trehalose (WO00/56365) and lipid aggregates (such as oil droplets or liposomes). Such carriers are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The vaccines may also contain diluents, such as water, saline, glycerol, etc. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, and the like, may be present. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients is available in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Immunogenic compositions used as vaccines comprise an immunologically effective amount of antigen, as well as any other of the above-mentioned components, as needed. By 'immunologically effective amount', it is meant that the administration of that amount to an individual, either in a single dose or as part of a series, is effective for treatment or prevention. This amount varies depending upon the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, age, the taxonomic group of individual to be treated (e.g. non-human primate, primate, etc.), the capacity of the individual's immune system to synthesise antibodies, the degree of protection desired, the formulation of the vaccine, the treating doctor's assessment of the medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the amount will fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials. Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule (e.g. including booster doses). The vaccine may be administered in conjunction with other immunoregulatory agents. The vaccine may be administered in conjunction with other immunoregulatory agents. The composition may include other adjuvants in addition to (or in place of) the aluminium salt. Preferred adjuvants to enhance effectiveness of the composition include, but are not limited to: (1) oil-in-water emulsion formulations (with or without other specific immunostimulating agents such as muramyl peptides (see below) or bacterial cell wall components), such as for example (a) MF59™ (WO90/14837; Chapter 10 in ref. 12), containing 5% Squalene, 0.5% Tween 80, and 0.5% Span 85 (optionally containing MTP-PE) formulated into submicron particles using a microfluidizer, (b) SAF, containing 10% Squalane, 0.4% Tween 80, 5% pluronic-blocked polymer L121, and thr-MDP either microfluidized into a submicron emulsion or vortexed to generate a larger particle size emulsion, and (c) Ribi™ adjuvant system (RAS), (Ribi Immunochem, Hamilton, MT) containing 2% Squalene, 0.2% Tween 80, and one or more bacterial cell wall components from the group consisting of monophosphorylipid A (MPL), trehalose dimycolate (TDM), and cell wall skeleton (CWS), preferably MPL + CWS (Detox™); (2) saponin adjuvants, such as QS21 or Stimulon™ (Cambridge Bioscience, Worcester, MA) may be used or particles generated therefrom such as ISCOMs (immunostimulating complexes), which ISCOMS may be devoid of additional detergent e.g.WO00/07621; (3) Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) and Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA); (4) cytokines, such as interleukins (e.g. IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12 (WO99/44636), etc.), interferons (e.g. gamma interferon), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), etc.; (5) monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) or 3-O-deacylated MPL (3dMPL) e.g.GB-2220221, EP-A-0689454; (6) combinations of 3dMPL with, for example, QS21 and/or oil-in-water emulsions e.g.EP-A-0835318, EP-A-0735898, EP-A-0761231; (7) oligonucleotides comprising CpG motifs [Krieg Vaccine 2000, 19, 618-622; Krieg Curr opin Mol Ther 2001 3:15-24; Roman et al., Nat.

The composition may comprise one or more of these further antigens. Where a saccharide or carbohydrate antigen is used, it is preferably conjugated to a carrier protein in order to enhance immunogenicity [e.g. refs. 53 to 62]. Preferred carrier proteins are bacterial toxins or toxoids, such as diphtheria or tetanus toxoids. The CRM197 diphtheria toxoid is particularly preferred. Other suitable carrier proteins include the N.meningitidis outer membrane protein [e.g. ref. 63], synthetic peptides [e.g. 64, 65], heat shock proteins [e.g. 66], pertussis proteins [e.g. 67, 68], protein D from H.influenzae [e.g. 69], toxin A or B from C.difficile [e.g. 70], etc. Where a mixture comprises capsular saccharides from both serogroups A and C, it is preferred that the ratio (w/w) of MenA saccharide:MenC saccharide is greater than 1 (e.g. 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 10:1 or higher). Saccharides from different serogroups of N.meningitidis may be conjugated to the same or different carrier proteins. Any suitable conjugation reaction can be used, with any suitable linker where necessary. Toxic protein antigens may be detoxified where necessary (e.g. detoxification of pertussis toxin by chemical and/or genetic means [31]). Where a diphtheria antigen is included in the composition it is preferred also to include tetanus antigen and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a tetanus antigen is included it is preferred also to include diphtheria and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a pertussis antigen is included it is preferred also to include diphtheria and tetanus antigens. Antigens are preferably mixed with (and more preferably adsorbed to) an aluminium salt (e.g. phosphate, hydroxide, hydroxyphosphate, oxyhydroxide, orthophosphate, sulphate). The salt may take any suitable form (e.g. gel, crystalline, amorphous etc.). Antigens in the composition will typically be present at a concentration of at least 1µg/ml each. In general, the concentration of any given antigen will be sufficient to elicit an immune response against that antigen. As an alternative to using proteins antigens in the composition of the invention, nucleic acid encoding the antigen may be used [e.g. refs. 71 to 79]. Protein components of the compositions of the invention may thus be replaced by nucleic acid (preferably DNA e.g. in the form of a plasmid) that encodes the protein. Definitions The term "comprising" means "including" as well as "consisting" e.g. a composition "comprising" X may consist exclusively of X or may include something additional e.g. X + Y. The term "about" in relation to a numerical value x means, for example, x±1 10%. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS Figure 1 shows 9 domains within 9612996, and Figure 1 shows how these have been manipulated. MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Hybrid pruteins - X1 = ΔG287 In addition to those disclosed in references 1 & 2, seven hybrid proteins with ΔG287 from strain 2996 at the N-terminus were constructed.

References 10 and 11 I disclose polymorphic forms of 961. The gene was found to be present in 91 % of serogroup B strains belonging to hypervirulent lineages ET-5, ET-37 and cluster A4, but was absent in all strains of lineage 3 tested. Most of the serogroup C strains tested were positive even if not belonging to hypervirulent lineages. The same was true for the serogroup B strains with serotype 2a and 2b. For serogroup A, one strain belonging to subgroup III was positive whereas the other two strains belonging to subgroup IV-1 were negative. 961 was absent in N.gonorrhoeae and in commensal species N.lactamica and N.cinerea. Figures 1 and 2 show domains in protein 961. When the anchor region (domain 9) of protein 961 is deleted (`961cL') and expressed in E.coli, the protein is exported in the periplasm and secreted in the supernatant of the culture. To investigate this further, deletion mutants in the C-terminal region of 961 were constructed (961cL-Δaro, 961cLΔcc, 961aL, 961aL-Δ1, 961aL-Δ2, 961aL-Δ3) on the basis of structural features (deletions of aromatic residues in the cases of 961cΔaro mutant, and of coiled-coil regions for the others). These were analysed for expression and secretion into the periplasm and the supernatant of the culture. In all of these deletion mutants, the protein is produced in large amount, is present in periplasmic fraction, and is released in the supernatant of the culture.
