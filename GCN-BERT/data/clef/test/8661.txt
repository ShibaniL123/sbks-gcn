CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a 371 of PCT/JP2011/080486, filed on Dec. 28, 2011, and claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-000547, filed on Jan. 5, 2011. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a cosmetic. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A horny layer, which is present in the outermost layer of the skin, has a function of suppressing entering of substances from the outside and water evaporation from the inside of the skin, and, at the same time, holding moisture in the horny layer itself so as to keep softness or smooth appearance of the skin. Lipid called a horny intercellular lipid (hereinafter, referred to as a horny ICL) is present in spaces in the horny cells constituting the horny layer such that the lipid is filled in the spaces between the horny cells. About 50% of lipid composition of the horny ICL is ceramides, and the remainder includes cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and fatty acid. In general, it is known that the reduction of the horny ICL, in particular, a ceramide causes not-preferable skin states such as rough skin, dry skin, and aged skin, and the horny layer reduced in a performance can be improved by externally supplementing the ceramide as a component for improving the function of the horny layer (Non-patent Literatures 1 and 2). However, since the ceramide has a strong crystalline property, and a high melting point, it is difficult to stabilize the ceramide during formulation. Therefore, in order to blend stably the ceramide into skin external composition, a surfactant and a large amount of various oil agents, or the like, need to be used together, and as a result, it has not been possible to avoid deterioration of a feeling upon use and limitation of the nature of formulation. Patent Literature 1 describes stabilization of the horny ICL containing a ceramide by using, for example, phospholipid and synthesized surfactants, but use of synthesized surfactants poses problems in terms of safety or a feeling upon use. Furthermore, there has been a problem that phospholipid itself is easily oxidized or degraded. Furthermore, Patent Literature 2 describes that when a ceramide is emulsified with a sphingosine which is a lipid present in a horny ICL and an acid, the ceramide is not crystallized and can be retained stably. However, combination of the sphingosine and the acid shows cationic property, so that anionic substances cannot be coexistent. On the other hand, an organic acid containing a sterol group is not the lipid which is present in the horny ICL, but has a similar structure to that of cholesterol sulfate or cholesteryl ester, and therefore has good affinity with the horny layer and high permeability.

EXAMPLES Examples 1 to 13 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4 Cosmetics having compositions shown in Tables 1 and 2 were produced and evaluated for the storage stability. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 together. (Producing Method) Components (A) and (C) were heated and stirred at 80 to 90° C. to be homogenized, and to the homogenized product, a component (B) which had been homogenized at 80° C. and 15% by weight of a component (D) were gradually added while stirring with a propeller at 450 rpm. Then, similarly, other oil ingredients were added thereto while stirring. The resultant product was cooled to 30° C. while further stirring to obtain a solution I. Next, methyl parahydroxybenzoate and glycerine were dissolved in 10% by weight of the component (D), and the resultant solution was added to the solution I to obtain a solution II. The pH of this condition was defined as pH at the time when the components (A) to (D) was dissolved and homogenized before the component (E) was added. Next, the component (E) and carboxyvinyl polymer were dissolved or dispersed in the rest of the component (D), and the resultant solution was added to the solution II to be homogenized. After that, the solution was cooled to 25° C. to obtain a cosmetic. (Evaluation Method) Each cosmetic was stored for one week at 50° C., 25° C. and −5° C., respectively, and then the appearance of the cosmetic was observed macroscopically.

Furthermore, when the cosmetics of these Examples were applied to the skin, they exhibited excellent permeability to the skin and excellent effect of improving roughness of the skin. Test Example Among the cosmetics of the Examples and Comparative Examples, cosmetic shown in Table 3 were evaluated for the water retaining amount. Results thereof are also shown in Table 3. (Evaluation Method) The measurement of the moisture amount of the skin was conducted at four portions in the vicinity each of three regions in the antebrachium, 12 portions in total, by using Corneometer (CORNEOMETER CM825, manufactured by Integral Corporation), and numeric values displayed on the Corneometer were used as the moisture amounts. Firstly, the moisture amount of the skin measured 10 minutes after the antebrachium had been washed with facial cleanser (Biore Cleansing Foam manufactured by KAO CORPORATION) and the water content had been removed was defied as an initial value. Next, each cosmetic was applied, the moisture amount of the skin was measured 6.5 hours after the application without washing, and the numeric value obtained by subtracting the initial value from the measured value was defined as the water retaining amount. Furthermore, after washing in the morning and after taking a bath, each cosmetic was applied, and then the moisture amount was measured 24 hours after the application without washing, and the numeric value obtained by subtracting the initial value from the measured value was defined as a water retaining amount of “24 hours after the application without washing.” Similarly, the moisture amount was measured after washing before measurement 24 hours after the application, and the numeric value obtained by subtracting the initial value from the measured value was defined as a water retaining amount of “24 hours after the application after washing.” TABLE 3 Comparative Examples Examples component (% by weight) 5 7 12 3 A n-octadecenyl succinic acid cholesteryl monoester 1 1 1 n-hexadecenyl succinic acid cholesteryl monoester 1 B L-arginine 0.2 0.2 potassium hydroxide 0.2 0.054 E phosphoric acid 0.01 0.02 succinic acid 0.03 C N-(hexadecyloxy hydroxypropyl)-N-hydroxyethyl 1 1 1 1 hexadecanamide squalane 1 1 1 cholesterol 0.5 1 1 1 glycerine 10 10 10 10 carboxyvinyl polymer 0.1 0.08 methyl parahydroxybenzoate 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 D ion exchanged water balance balance balance balance Total 100 100 100 100 pH: when dissolved and homogenized (when 12.2 9.2 8.4 8.4 components (A), (B), (C) and (D) are mixed) immediately after manufactured (pH as cosmetic) 9.4 6.4 6.6 4 E/A 0.03 0 0.01 0.02 A/C 1 1 1 1 water retaining amount (6.5 hours after the application 14.0 19.7 21.8 10.0 without washing) water retaining amount (24 hours after the application 25.4 34.5 16.5 7.6 without washing) water retaining amount (24 hours after the application 16.4 12.5 10.5 −0.3 after washing) As shown in Table 3, in both cases 6.5 hours and 24 hours after the application, higher resultant values of the water retaining amount were obtained in Examples as compared with Comparative Example.
