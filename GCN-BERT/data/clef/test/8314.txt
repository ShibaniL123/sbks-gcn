3,4-difluoro-5'-hexyl-[2,2'-bithiophene]-5-carbaldehyde (OHC-2)
In a flame dried flask equipped with an addition funnel, 3,4-difluoro-5'-hexyl-2,2'-bithiophene [2] (8.5 g, 29.7 mmol) was dissolved in dry 1,2-dichloroethane (150 mL) and cooled to 0° C. The Vilsmeier reagent was prepared by adding POCl3 (5.46 g, 35.6 mmol, 3.32 mL) to DMF (3.3 g, 45 mmol, 3.43 mL) and the orange solution was added dropwise via addition funnel. The reaction was then heated at 80° C. for 20 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was neutralized with saturated NaHCO3. The aqueous portion was extracted with DCM (3×100 mL) and the combined organics were washed with water and brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo to give the crude product, which was further purified by chromatography on silica gel (2% EtOAc/hexanes) to furnish a yellow solid (6.53 g, 20.8 mmol, 70% yield).
