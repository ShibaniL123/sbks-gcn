Device for monitoring the observance of a home oxygen therapy treatment The invention relates to a device and an installation for monitoring a home oxygen therapy treatment. Oxygen therapy is a treatment consisting in administering, to a patient having need thereof, an oxygen-rich gas, for example pure oxygen or an 02/air mixture, so as to maintain or restore his or her blood oxygen level. This treatment makes it possible to support patients suffering certain respiratory pathologies, such as chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathies (COBP), and thus improve their quality of life and the life expectation. Oxygen therapy treatment is generally implemented in the home, that is to say in the home of the patient. Consequently, it is necessary, even crucial, to provide monitoring for in-home patients so as to be able to assess the effectiveness of the treatment which is closely linked to the amount of time the patients spend each day consuming oxygen. In other words, an effective monitoring of the patient is essential to ensure compliance with the treatment by the patient, that is to say to determine the period of time during the day for which he or she actually undertakes his or her oxygen therapy treatment, and then to be able to assess the true effectiveness of the treatment on the patient concerned. To do this, monitoring and remote surveillance devices have been developed and some are already available on the marinet. These devices all operate according to more or less the same principle, namely measuring pressure inside either the duct linking the oxygen source to the airways of the patient, or directly at the cannula distributing the oxygen to the airways of the patient, and/or by measuring the flow rate in the duct or in cannula. The pressure and/or flow rate measurements make it possible to detect the presence of an oxygen flow rate and the breathing of the patient. However, the existing monitoring devices present a certain number of problems and drawbacks. Some of these devices have a mode of operation relying on the measurement at a single point, that is to say close to the gas source or in the middle of the duct from the cannula, of various physical quantities, primarily pressure. For these devices, the signal coining from the oxygen-rich gas source (i.e. the gas flow rate) and the signal coming from the patient (i.e. the breathing) are often difficult to separate. This then makes it necessary to use reduced operating ranges and leads to strong measurement inaccuracies or uncertainties (see figure 3) . For example, in some cases, the patient may be considered by the monitoring apparatus to be "present"' â€™whereas, in reality, there is only the connected gas source and the patient is absent or not linked to the breathing gas delivery system. The other devices use double lumen cannulas. In this case, one of the two ducts from the cannula is used to pass the oxygen to the cannula outlet. This duct is connected at the monitoring apparatus to a connector linked to a pipe passing through the apparatus. The pipe coming from the oxygen source is connected at the input of this pipe. The pipe is equipped with a pressure and/or flow rate sensor. The other duct is connected at the monitoring apparatus to a connector linked to a pressure sensor embedded in the monitoring apparatus. The analysis of the signal measured by this sensor makes it possible to detect the breathing of a patient without being affected by the disturbances of the oxygen source. However, because they are more expensive, there are fewer double lumen cannulas and they are less diversified than the single cannulas, In certain cases, it is not therefore possible to match the cannulas to the need of the patient: the treatment thereof will be less effective or the patient will not adhere to his or her treatment, Moreover, some demand valve oxygen sources need to be linked to the second duct of a double lumen cannula. In this case, the monitoring apparatus will not operate: the second duct will not be connected to the embedded pressure sensor and the apparatus will no longer' detect the breathing of the patient. Furthermore, the current systems often detect only the compliance, whereas it is necessary to know not only the compliance of the patient in order, if necessary, to be more attentive to him or her in his or her treatment, but also the effectiveness of the treatment undertaken by the patient. The problem which is posed is then how to propose an improved device for monitoring an in-home oxygen therapy treatment, The solution is a device for monitoring compliance with an oxygen therapy treatment comprising: i) a nasal cannula for supplying the nostrils of a patient with an oxygen-rich gas, ii) a data measurement and transmission unit arranged on or at the nasal cannula comprising: a pressure sensor and a temperature sensor suitable for and designed for obtaining raw pressure and temperature measurement data measured by said comprising: measurement data measured by said sensors, and a first data transmission system suitable for and designed for transmitting the raw measurement data measured by said sensors to a data acquisition and process ing unit, and data acquisition and processing unit an analysis algorithm making it possible to collect che raw measurement data emitted by the data transmission system and to process said raw data to obtain processed measurement data, and a second data transmission system suitable for and designed for transmitting all or part of the raw measurement data and of the measurement data processed by the analysis algorithm to at least one remote data reception device. Depending on the case, the device of the invention may comprise one or more of the following technical features: The pressure and temperature sensors are suitable for and designed for obtaining raw pressure and temperature measurement data, and for converting them into pressure and temperature electrical signals. The nasal cannula is fluidically connected to at least one flexible gas intake duct. The first data transmission system and/or the second data transmission system comprise an emitting antenna, preferably an emitting antenna having a range of several meters, The data acquisition and processing unit comprises at least one microprocessor. The data acquisition and processing unit comprises at least one data storage memory. The data acquisition and processing unit comprises a module containing the analysis algorithm and the second data transmission system. The pressure and temperature sensors are suitable for and designed for obtaining raw pressure and temperature measurement data, and for converting them into pressure and temperature electrical signals, respectively. The data measurement and transmission unit further comprises a C02 or 02 concentration sensor or an acceleration sensor, and the first data transmission system is suitable for and designed for transmitting the raw measurement data measured by said C02 or 02 concentration sensors or acceleration sensor to the data acquisition and processing unit. The pressure, temperature and C02 or 02 concentration or acceleration sensors are suitable for and designed for obtaining raw pressure, temperature and C02 or 02 concentration or acceleration measurement data, and for converting them into pressure, temperature and C02 or 02 concentration or acceleration electrical signals, respectively. It comprises an electrical energy source supplying the data measurement and transmission unit with electrical current. The first data transmission system comprises a microprocessor suitable for applying a filtering or an averaging of the raw data. Moreover, the invention relates also to an oxygen therapy installation comprising a device for monitoring compliance with an oxygen therapy treatment according to the invention; and a remote data reception device co-operating with the data acquisition and processing unit of the compliance monitoring device. Preferably, the remote data reception device comprises a server. The data can there be notably stored, transformed, analyzed, converted, displayed, edited, consulted, used to establish reports, a diagnosis, curves, graphs, tables, etc. The present invention will now be better understood from the following explanations given with reference to the attached figures in which: figure 1 represents a schematic view of an embodiment of a device for monitoring compliance with an oxygen therapy treatment according to the present invention; figure 2 represents a schematic view of the device of figure 1 worn by a patient and the way it cooperates with the other components of an installation according to the invention; and figure 3 shows the pressure signal differences that exist at various points of the oxygen intake cannu1a. Figure 1 schematically represents an embodiment of a device for monitoring compliance with an oxygen therapy treatment according to the present invention, The latter comprises a nasal cannula 1 for supplying the nostrils of a patient with an oxygen-rich gas, via two expansions or end fittings 14, 15 that are positioned inside the nostrils of the patient. The nasal cannula 1 is hollow and is supplied with an oxygen-rich gas via a flexible gas supply duct 10 fluidically linking an oxygen-rich gas source, such as an oxygen cylinder (not schematically represented), to the nasal cannula 1. The flexible duct 10 is connected to the gas source via a connector 16' situated at its upstream end. In the embodiment presented in figure 1, the flexible duct 10 splits (at 11) into two subducts 12, 13 that via each connect, via their downstream end, cannula 1 to bring oxygen to the therefore to each of the end fittings 14, , to the nasal cannula 1 and 15 . However, according to another embodiment (not represented} , it is also possible to use a cannula 1 whose supply duct 10 does not split and connects only to one side of the cannula 1. According to the invention, a data measurement and transmission unit 2 is arranged on or at, that is to say in immediate proximity to or in the region of, the nasal cannula 1. Preferably, the data measurement and transmission unit 2 and the cannula 1 are secured to one another. This data measurement and transmission unit 2 comprises a combination of several sensors, namely a pressure sensor and a temperature sensor, and, optionally, a C02 and/or 02 concentration sensor and/or an acceleration sensor, The measurements taken by this unit 2, that is to say obtained by the abovementioned sensors, can make it possible to detect the breathing of the patient and/or his or her activity. The sensors of the unit 2 that make it possible to produce pressure and temperature measurements, and, optionally, C02 or 02 concentration and/or acceleration measurements, and/or capacity measurements at the nasal cannula 1, therefore as close as possible to the patient. Once measured, these raw pressure and temperature, and optionally C02 or 02 concentration, and/or acceleration, and/or capacity measurement information or data, are converted into electrical signals which are then transmitted by a first data transmission system, preferably incorporated in the unit 2. This first data transmission system comprises, for example, a microprocessor which can manage a first processing of raw data such as a filtering or averaging, and a short-range antenna, for example with a range of a few meters, The transmission is, for example, done in the radio frequency or acoustic (SAW or ultrasound) mode. The energy necessary for the measurements and for the transmission of the data can be provided by wires incorporated directly in the cannula 1 and linked at the other end to an energy source, but preferably via an energy harvesting unit which can be a unit for harvesting mechanical energy, for example via a transducer which transforms the vibratory energy of a micro beam into electrical current, or a unit for harvesting radiation energy, for example via a transducer which transforms the energy of RF or acoustic or ultrasound waves into electrical current. The raw data are collected and processed in a data acqiiis.it ion and processing unit 3 situated at a distance from the nasal cannula 1. Within the data acquisition and processing unit 3, also called acquisition module, an analysis algorithm 3 makes it possible to collect the raw measurement data emitted by the data transmission system and process them to obtain processed measurement data, which are then transmitted by a second data transmission system 5. In fact, the second data transmission system 5 is suitable for and designed for transmitting the raw measurement data and/or measurement data processed by the analysis algorithm, to at least one remote data reception device 6, such as a remote server where they can be processed, stored, etc. In this second data transmission system 5, the. transmission is done for example in the GPRS mode, or else by writing the data onto an SD card which can then be read on a computer or PC, portable or not, or by a system capable of automatically transmitting the data to a remote data reception device, such as a remote server. The idea is therefore to use a number of sensors that are as unobtrusive as possible, arranged directly on the cannula 1 and communicating with a suitable acquisition module, that is to say the unit 3. This module 3 can be completely detached far from the patient, for example on or at the gas source, or worn by the patient. It can contain one or more pressure and optionally flow rate and/or acceleration sensors. In the case of pressure and/or flow rate sensors, the device of the invention is equipped with a duct passing through it, and pneumatic connectors compatible with the oxygen pipes and cannulas at each end. The flow of oxygen originating from the source passes through the module via this duct. The sensors are either disposable, like the cannula 1, or disinfectable, that is to say sterilizable, and therefore reus3.ble. In both cases, they can be mounted on any cannula 1. If they are disinfectable and/or sterilizable, they must be able to be dismantled and they must be protected by a gel or a membrane, of Gore-Texâ„¢ type for example, supporting the disinfection without affecting the measurement. The measurement unit 2 is, for example, equipped with a needle enabling it to pierce the cannula 1 in order for the sensor or sensors to be able to produce measurements of the characteristics of the gas inside the cannula. The two measurement units are equipped with rings enabling them to be attached to and possibly detached from the cannula 1. The rings and the sensors must be covered with a material that is comfortable for the patient. As schematically represented in figure 1, a module 3 can be used which makes it possible to record data and transmit them, comprising a microprocessor with algorithm 4, a memory chip making it possible to store all or part of the raw and/or processed data, a radio frequency antenna 7 making it possible to ensure the wireless transmission of the raw or processed data and the power supply for the measurement unit if the latter is powered by an energy harvesting unit of RF type, and a battery 8 enabling the system to operate in total autonomy. The battery 8 can be recharged either simply via a power supply plug which can be connected directly to the mains, when this module 3 is completely detached from the patient, or by induction or via a power supply plug associated with the pneumatic connector when this module 3 is worn by the patient and it is equipped with a duct passing through it. In this latter case, the pipe 10 linking the oxygen source to the patient will incorporate an electrical power supply wire which is linked, on the source side, to the mains. Figure 2 schematically represents the operation of a device according to the invention, in particular the transmission of the data between the different elements or units, when a patient 2 0 is equipped with said device according to the invention. As can be seen, the information or data of pressure and temperature type, and possibly of C02 or 02 content, capacity and/or acceleration type, are measured by sensors situated on the cannula 1 supplying the patient 20 with oxygen originating from an oxygen source that is either fixed 18, or mobile 17, such as a small ambulatory oxygen cylinder. The duly collected data are then transmitted to the module 3 serving as data acquisition and processing unit. This module 3 is arranged at a distance from the cannula 1. For example, it can be arranged on the flexible duct 10 supplying the oxygen-rich gas, such as pure oxygen, from the oxygen source 17, 18 to the nasal cannula 1 supplying the nasal airways of the patient 20, or, as appropriate, on one or other of the oxygen sources 17, 18, The module 3 can itself also measure other pressure data and/or flow rate and/or acceleration data. It can, after acquisition and/or reception of the raw data, store them in raw form and moreover process them bymeans of an appropriate analysis algorithm to obtain processed measurement data which can in turn be stored and/or emitted by a second data transmission system 5 internal to the module 3. The pressure and temperature, and/or C02 and/or 02 content or other data, measured on the measurement unit 2, can be stored over a buffer period of at least 30 sec. , for example 1 minute or more. The stored data, will be able to be filtered to eliminate any disturbance due to the environment. The detection of the breathing of a patient is deduced from the variation of at least one of these data during the buffer period. Then, an algorithm, for example comprising components of FFT type, is applied to the stored datum or data to deduce therefrom the average and maximum respiratory rate . The acceleration data measured on the measurement unit 2 or in the module 3 are stored over a buffer period, for example 1 minute. Indicators of the level of activity are calculated from these data, for example the "magnitude vector" signal and/or the "magnitude area" signal, and/or the average and/or the standard deviation, and/or the variance. These activity indicators are then compared to thresholds set by trial and error as a function of the levels of activity that have to be detected: at rest, active, seated, lying down, etc. The pressure and/or flow rate data measured in the module 3 are stored over a buffer period, for example 6 seconds. The average of these values is computed and the presence or not of an oxygen flow rate, and possibly the value of this oxygen flow rate, is/are deduced therefrom. All or part of the raw measurement data and/or processed measurement data are then sent to at least one remote data reception device, in particular to a server or similar where they are kept and used subsequently to determine 'whether the patient 2 0 is indeed complying with his or her treatment and if this treatment is effective, In other words, one or two data measurement and transmission units 2 are arranged on the nasal cannula 1 and comprise pressure and temperature sensors, and, optionally, one or more additional C02 or 02 concentration, capacity or acceleration sensors, or a combination thereof. These sensors have no battery and draw their energy from an external source, that is to say from wires incorporated in the cannula 1 or from an energy harvesting unit. Moreover, the acquisition unit 3 situated on the patient or away/remote from the patient has the capacity to process the collected data with an appropriate analysis algorithm 4, that is to say software for downloading processed and raw data, and also has a communication means 5 capable of transmitting the information to a remote server 6, The acquisition unit 3 can also be equipped with sensors to add to the data collected by the nasal cannula unit, for example flow rate, gas concentration and/or acceleration. Moreover, figure 3 represents the pressure signal differences that exist at various locations on the oxygen intake cannula. As can be seen, the pressure signal is all the more accurate and useable when it is measured in proximity to the patient 20. The same applies to the temperature signal. The fact that the signal is measured at the nose makes it possible to obtain a patient pressure signal and a temperature signal that are stronger than each of these signals when measured at the gas source 17, 18 or between the gas source and the cannula. This therefore makes it possible to clearly understand the benefit of the device according to present invention in which the pressure and temperature sensors 2 are situated at the nose, that is to say on the cannula 1, and which communicates with an acquisition module 3 placed further away, for example either on the duct 10 supplying the gas to the cannula 1, or external to the medical equipment. Indeed, the fact that the pressure and temperature sensors 2, even other sensors, are situated close to the patient makes it possible to amplify the "patient" signal relative to the signal at the gas source 17, 18, and therefore facilitates their separation and the resulting analysis. In effect, if is the variations of the patient signal which are of interest and have to he exploited to deduce therefrom the breathing of the patient, the periods of respiration through the mouth and the respiratory rate of the patient. Being situated right at the point where this signal is created therefore makes it possible to overcome the problem caused by the gas source 17, 18 that is generally observed when the sensors are placed on the duct 10, arriving at the cannula 1 at mid-path between the patient 20 and the gas source 17, 18. The device and the installation according to the invention make it possible to considerably improve the monitoring of compliance of a patient with an in-home oxygen therapy treatment, that is to say a treatment implemented outside of the hospital, notably in the home of the patient. 1.
