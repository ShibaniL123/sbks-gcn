Reference to a Sequence Listing This application incorporates by reference a Sequence Listing submitted with this application as text file PURIF300WO1_SL created on May 13, 2014 and having a size of 8,521 bytes. 1.2. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to the purification of recombinantly produced polypeptides. In a more particular embodiment, the invention relates to methods of separating recombinantly produced polypeptides from host cell proteins (HCPs). 1.3. Background of the Invention Recombinantly produced polypeptides, such as antibodies and other proteins, are used in a wide array of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The process of manufacturing recombinant polypeptides generally involves expression of the polypeptide in a host cell, and purification of the polypeptide. Expression generally involves culturing a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell under appropriate conditions for the host cells to produce the recombinant polypeptide. The recombinant polypeptide can be expressed in different locations within the host cell, which can impact the methods used for isolation and purification of the product. Once a recombinant polypeptide is expressed, intact host cells and cell debris are separated from the cell culture media in a process referred to as “cell harvesting.” For example, host cells can be separated from the cell culture media by centrifugation or filtration to provide a clarified fluid (which can be referred to as the “cell culture supernatant”) that includes the recombinant polypeptide and other impurities. Examples of impurities that may be found in the clarified cell culture supernatant include, but are not limited to, host cell proteins (HOP), nucleic acids, endotoxins, viruses, protein variants and protein aggregates. Purification refers to the removal of impurities from the clarified cell culture supernatant and typically involves one or more chromatography steps. Typical processes include capture, intermediate purification or polishing, and final polishing steps. Affinity chromatography, for example, Protein A chromatography or ion exchange chromatography, is often used as a capture step. Often, capture is followed by at least two intermediate purification or polishing steps to increase purity and remove of viral contaminants. Intermediate purification or polishing steps are often accomplished by affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). In many processes, the final polishing step is accomplished using ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, or gel filtration. Preferably, biopharmaceutical products have a very high purity, with the concentration of impurities, such as host cell proteins, reduced to the range of parts per million relative to the desired product, or lower. Consequently, there remains a need for purification processes that optimize removal of impurities, in particular, host cell proteins. 2.

In one embodiment, the antibody includes a heavy chain amino acid sequence having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antibody 1 or antibody 2. The terms CDR region or CDR, refer to the hypervariable regions of the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin as defined by Kabat et al. (Kabat, Ε. A. et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Edition. US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Service, NIH, Washington or later editions) or Chothia and Lesk (J. Mol. Biol., 196:901 -917 (1987)). An antibody typically contains 3 heavy chain CDRs and 3 light chain CDRs. The term CDR or CDRs is used here in order to indicate, according to the case, one of these regions or several, or even the whole, of these regions which contain the majority of the amino acid residues responsible for the binding by affinity of the antibody for the antigen or the epitope which it recognizes. Among the six short CDR sequences, the third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) has a greater size variability (greater diversity essentially due to the mechanisms of arrangement of the genes which give rise to it). It may be as short as 2 amino acids although the longest size known is 26. CDR length may also vary according to the length that can be accommodated by the particular underlying framework. Functionally, HCDR3 plays a role in part in the determination of the specificity of the antibody. One of skill in the art is able to determine CDR regions of an antibody. In general, HCDR1 is about 5 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 31-35; HCDR2 is about 17 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 50-65; HCDR3 is about 11 or 12 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 95-102, optionally including Kabat residue 100D; LCDR1 is about 11 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 24-34; LCDR2 is about 7 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 50-56; and LCDR3 is about 8 or 9 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 89-97, optionally including Kabat residue 95.

Introduction A common problem encountered during Protein A purification is non-specific binding of impurities such as host cell protein (HOP), DNA and other cell culture-derived impurities to the column resin and to the protein of interest. For example, eluate from a Protein A column having large amounts of host cell proteins, for example, up to about 500 ng/mg, 600 ng/mg, 700 ng/mg, 800 ng/mg, 900 ng/mg, 1000 ng/mg, 1500 ng/mg, 2000 ng/mg or more HOP has been observed. The presence of HOP can be problematic, not only because of health regulations relating to acceptable levels of contaminants in recombinant antibody products, but also because the presence of HOP can adversely impact product stability and/or efficacy, including, for example, protease activity and formation of visible particulates, fragments or aggregates over time. Applicants have found that including a fatty acid in at least one Protein A wash buffer can substantially decrease the level of host cell proteins in the Protein A eluate. In one example, inclusion of a fatty acid in at least one Protein A wash buffer can substantially decrease protease activity in the eluate. Examples of proteases include serine proteases, aspartyl proteases, such as cathepsin-D, cysteine proteases, metalloproteases, aminopeptidases, and combinations thereof. Additionally, including a fatty acid in a Protein A wash buffer can reduce protease activity in a formulation containing a recombinantly produced polypeptide. Furthermore, including a fatty acid in a Protein A wash buffer can increase stability of a recombinantly produced polypeptide, for example, by reducing particle formulation and/or fragmentation. Described herein is a purification process for recombinantly produced polypeptides. In a more particular embodiment, a purification process for recombinantly produced antibodies is described. 4.2. Terminology Unless otherwise defined, scientific and technical terms used herein shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Generally, nomenclatures used in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, and protein and oligo- or polynucleotide chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well-known and commonly used in the art. Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes. As used in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings: As used herein, the term “about” is used to modify, for example, the quantity of an ingredient in a composition, concentration, volume, process temperature, process time, yield, flow rate, pressure, and ranges thereof, employed in describing the invention. The term “about” refers to variation in the numerical quantity that can occur, for example, through typical measuring and handling procedures used for making compounds, compositions, concentrates or formulations; through inadvertent error in these procedures; through differences in the manufacture, source, or purity of starting materials or ingredients used to carry out the methods, and other similar considerations. The term "about" also encompasses amounts that differ due to aging of a formulation with a particular initial concentration or mixture, and amounts that differ due to mixing or processing a formulation with a particular initial concentration or mixture. Where modified by the term "about" the claims appended hereto include such equivalents. As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to a polypeptide or group of polypeptides that include at least one binding domain that is formed from the folding of polypeptide chains having three-dimensional binding spaces with internal surface shapes and charge distributions complementary to the features of an antigenic determinant of an antigen. An antibody typically has a tetrameric form, with two pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light" and one "heavy" chain. The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form an antibody binding site. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains (CH). Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain (CL) at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Light chains are classified as either lambda chains or kappa chains based on the amino acid sequence of the light chain constant region. The variable domain of a kappa light chain may also be denoted herein as VK. The terms “antibody,” “antibodies” and “immunoglobulins” as used herein encompass monoclonal antibodies (including full-length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies formed from at least two different epitope binding fragments (e.g., bispecific antibodies), CDR-grafted, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, camelised antibodies, chimeric antibodies, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, single domain antibodies, Fab fragments, Fab’ fragments, F(ab')2 fragments, antibody fragments that exhibit a desired biological activity (e.g. the antigen binding portion), disulfide-linked Fvs (dsFv), and anti-idiotypic (anti-ld) antibodies, intrabodies, and epitope-binding fragments or derivatives of any of the above. In particular, antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain at least one antigenbinding site. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any isotype (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), subisotype (e.g., lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, lgA1 and lgA2) or allotype (e.g., Gm, e.g., G1 m(f, ζ, a or χ), G2m(n), G3m(g, b, or c), Am, Em, and Km(1,2 or 3)). Antibodies may be derived from any mammalian species, including, but not limited to, humans, monkeys, pigs, horses, rabbits, dogs, cats, mice, etc., or other animals such as birds (e.g. chickens). Antibodies may be fused to a heterologous polypeptide sequence, for example, a tag to facilitate purification. The term "bind" or "binding" when discussing the interaction between a molecule and a column material means exposing the molecule to the column material under conditions such that the molecule is reversibly immobilized in or on the column material. The term "cell culture supernatant" refers to a solution that is obtained by culturing host cells that produce a recombinant polypeptide of interest. In addition to the recombinant polypeptide, the cell culture supernatant may also include components of cell culture medium, metabolic byproducts secreted by the host cells as well as other components of the cultured cells. As used herein, the term “clarified cell culture supernatant” refers to a composition from which the host cells have been removed or harvested, such that the cell culture supernatant is generally free of cellular debris and/or intact cells. The term "excipient" as used herein refers to an inert substance which is commonly used as a diluent, vehicle, preservative, binder or stabilizing agent for drugs which imparts a beneficial physical property to a formulation, such as increased protein stability, increased protein solubility, and/or decreased viscosity. Examples of excipients include, but are not limited to, proteins (for example, but not limited to, serum albumin), amino acids (for example, but not limited to, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, arginine, glycine), surfactants (for example, but not limited to, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, polysorbate and nonionic surfactants), saccharides (for example, but not limited to, glucose, sucrose, maltose and trehalose), polyols (for example, but not limited to, mannitol and sorbitol), fatty acids and phospholipids (for example, but not limited to, alkyl sulfonates and caprylate). The phrase "host cell" or “host cells” refers to cells which express a recombinant polypeptide. In particular, the term "host cell" refers to a cell that can or has taken up a nucleic acid, such as a vector, and supports replication of the nucleic acid and production of one or more encoded products. The term "host cell" can refer to a variety of cell types including prokaryotic cells, such as Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Bacillus species; yeast cells, such as Pichia pastoris, Pichia methanolica, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae; insect cell, such as bacculovirus and eukaryotic cells. Examples of eukaryotic host cells include mammalian cells, for example, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ 293) cells, Vero cells, baby hamster kidney (ΒΗΚ) cells, HeLa cells, CV1 monkey kidney cells, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, 3Τ3 cells, myeloma cell lines, COS cells (e.g., COS1 and COS7) PC12, WI38 cells. The term host cell also encompasses combinations or mixtures of cells including, e.g., mixed cultures of different cell types or cell lines. The term "impurity" refers to any foreign material, particularly a biological macromolecule such as DNA, RNA, or a protein, other than the recombinantly produced polypeptide that is present in a sample. Contaminants can include host cell proteins other than the recombinant polypeptide of interest. The term "purify" or "purifying" a recombinant polypeptide from a composition or solution that includes the recombinant polypeptide and one or more contaminants means increasing the degree of purity of the desired protein in the composition or solution by removing (completely or partially) at least one contaminant from the composition or solution. The term "mAb" refers to a monoclonal antibody. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein means approved by a regulatory agency of a Federal or state government, or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia, European Pharmacopia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The terms "polypeptide" or “protein” can be used interchangeably to refer to a molecule having two or more amino acid residues joined to each other by peptide bonds. The term "polypeptide" can refer to antibodies and other non-antibody proteins. Non-antibody proteins include, but are not limited to, proteins such as enzymes, receptors, ligands of a cell surface protein, secreted proteins and fusion proteins or fragments thereof. The polypeptide may or may not be fused to another polypeptide. Polypeptides can also include modifications such as, but not limited to, glycosylation, lipid attachment, sulfation, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, hydroxylation and ADP-ribosylation. Polypeptides can be of scientific or commercial interest, including protein-based therapeutics. The term "recombinant" refers to a biological material, for example, a nucleic acid or protein, that has been artificially or synthetically (i.e., non-naturally) altered by human intervention. The term "remove," when used in context of removal of host cell proteins, refers to reduction in the amount of host cell protein in the purified product. Removal may or may not result in the absence of host cell protein from the purified product. In general, removal refers to at least a 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 5 fold, 10 fold, 15 fold, 20 fold, 25 fold and up to 30 fold, 35 fold, 40 fold, 45 fold or 50 fold reduction in host cell protein in the purified product when compared to the level of host cell proteins in the original composition. The terms "stability" and "stable" as used herein in the context of a formulation of a recombinantly produced polypeptide, for example, a pharmaceutical formulation that includes a recombinantly produced antibody or antibody fragment, refer to the resistance of the polypeptide in the formulation to particle formation, aggregation, degradation or fragmentation under manufacture, preparation, transportation and storage conditions. A "stable" formulation retains biological activity under manufacture, preparation, transportation and storage conditions. Stability can be assessed by degrees of particle formation, aggregation, degradation or fragmentation, as measured by HPSEC, static light scattering (SLS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), circular dichroism (CD), urea unfolding techniques, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, differential scanning calorimetry, and/or ANS binding techniques, as compared to a reference formulation. As used herein, "substantially pure" refers to a biological material that is the predominant species present (e.g., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the composition). In one embodiment, a substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the biological material includes at least about 50% (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. Generally, a substantially pure composition will include more than about 80% of all macromolecular species present in the composition, or more than about 85%, more than about 90%, more than about 95%, or more than about 99%. In one embodiment, the biological material is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) and the composition includes essentially a single macromolecular species. 4.3. Recombinant Polypeptide Production In one embodiment, a recombinant polypeptide is produced using host cells that have been transfected, either stably or transiently, with a vector capable of expressing one or more polypeptides of interest. As used herein, the term "vector" refers to composition of matter which can be used to deliver a nucleic acid of interest to the interior of a cell. Numerous vectors are known including, but not limited to, linear polynucleotides, polynucleotides associated with ionic or amphiphilic compounds, plasmids, and viruses. The term "vector" can include an autonomously replicating plasmid or a virus or a vector or plasmid that is not autonomously replicating. The term “transfection” refers to the introduction of exogenous genetic material into cells to produce genetically modified cells. Vectors can be introduced into a host cell using methods known in the art. For example, a vector can be transferred into a host cell by physical, chemical or biological means. Physical methods for introducing a polynucleotide into a host cell include, but are not limited to, calcium phosphate precipitation, lipofection (including positively charged liposome mediated transfection), particle bombardment, microinjection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection and electroporation. Biological methods for introducing a vector into a host cell include the use of DNA and RNA vectors, including, for example, viral vectors, Chemical means for introducing a polynucleotide into a host cell include colloidal dispersion systems, such as macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipidbased systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. The host cells can be genetically engineered to express a recombinant polypeptide, for example, a polypeptide of commercial or scientific interest. The term “cell culture” refers to the growth and propagation of cells outside of a multicellular organism or tissue. Cell culture conditions such as pH, temperature, humidity, atmosphere and agitation can be varied to improve growth and/or productivity characteristics of the cell culture. Host cells may be cultured in suspension or while attached to a solid substrate. Host cells can be cultured in small scale cultures, for example, in a laboratory setting at volumes as low as 25 ml and up to about 50 ml, up to about 100 ml, up to about 150 ml or up to about 200 ml. Alternatively, the cultures can be large scale, for example, at volumes from about 300 ml, 500 ml or 1000 ml and up to about 5000 ml, up to about 10,000 ml and up to about 15,000 ml. Commercial scale bioreactors can also be used, for example, at volumes of up to about 1,000L, up to about 5,000L or up to about 10,000L of media. Large scale production of recombinant polypeptides by mammalian cells can include continuous, batch and fed-batch culture systems. Host cells may be cultured, for example, in fluidized bed bioreactors, hollow fiber bioreactors, roller bottles, shake flasks, or stirred tank bioreactors, with or without microcarriers, and operated in a batch, fed batch, continuous, semi-continuous, or perfusion mode. Large scale cell cultures are typically maintained for days, or even weeks, while the cells produce the desired protein product(s). Suitable host cells for production of recombinant polypeptides include both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Examples of eukaryotic cells include mammalian cells. Examples of mammalian cells suitable for production of recombinant polypeptides include, but are not limited to, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mouse myeloma (NS0), human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ 293), baby hamster kidney (ΒΗΚ) cells, Vero cells, HeLa cells, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, CV1 monkey kidney cells, 3Τ3 cells, myeloma cell lines such as NS0 and NS1, PC12, WI38 cells, COS cells (including COS-1 and COS-7), and C127. In general, mammalian cell cultures are maintained at a pH between about 6.5 and about 7.5 and at a temperature between about 36°C and about 38°C, typically at about 37°C and a relative humidity between about 80% and about 95%. Mammalian cell culture media typically contain buffering systems that require a carbon dioxide (C02) atmosphere between about 1% and about 10%, or between about 5% and about 6%. The host cells can be maintained in a variety of cell culture media. The term "cell culture medium" refers to a nutrient solution in which the host cells are grown. Cell culture media formulations are well known in the art. Typically, cell culture media include buffers, salts, carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins and trace essential elements. The cell culture medium may or may not contain serum, peptone, and/or proteins. Cell culture media may be supplemented with additional or increased concentrations of components such as amino acids, salts, sugars, vitamins, hormones, growth factors, buffers, antibiotics, lipids, trace elements and the like, depending on the requirements of the cells to be cultured and/or the desired cell culture parameters. Various culture media, including serum-free and defined culture media, are commercially available, and include, but are not limited to, Minimal Essential Medium (MEM, Sigma, St. Louis, Μο.); Ham's F10 Medium (Sigma); Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM, Sigma); Minimal Essential Medium (MEM); Basal Medium Eagle (ΒΜΕ); RPMI-1640 Medium (Sigma); HyClone cell culture medium (HyClone, Logan, Utah); and chemically-defined (CD) media, which are formulated for particular cell types, e.g., CD-CHO Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Supplementary components or ingredients can be added to commercially available media, if desired. The term "recombinant polypeptide" as used herein refers to a genetically engineered polypeptide or protein produced by a cultured host cell. As used herein, the term “heterologous” refers to a recombinant polypeptide that is produced by a host cell that does not normally express that polypeptide. However, a heterologous polypeptide can include polypeptides that are native to an organism, but that have been intentionally altered in some manner. For example, a heterologous polypeptide can include a polypeptide that is expressed by a host cell that has been transfected with a vector that expresses the polypeptide. The recombinant polypeptides expressed by the cell culture may be produced intracellularly or be secreted into the culture medium from which they can be recovered and/or collected. In one embodiment, the recombinant polypeptide is an antibody or binding fragment thereof. An antibody may be oligoclonal, polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, camelised, CDR-grafted, multi-specific, bi-specific, catalytic, humanized, fully human, anti-idiotypic and antibodies that can be labeled in soluble or bound form as well as fragments, including epitope-binding fragments, variants or derivatives thereof, either alone or in combination with other amino acid sequences. An antibody may be from any species. The term antibody also includes binding fragments, including, but not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2 single stranded antibody (svFC), dimeric variable region (Diabody) and disulphide-linked variable region (dsFv). Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, lgA1 and lgA2) or subclass. In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof may be fused to a heterologous polypeptide sequence, such as an affinity tag, to facilitate purification. Examples of affinity tags include, but are not limited to, polyhistidine tags, GFP tags, FLAG tags, GST tags, V5 tags and Myc tags. In one embodiment, the antibody is an anti-IL-18 antibody or an anti-IL6 antibody, or a fragment thereof. In other embodiments, the antibody can be any antibody that co-purifies with a host cell protein. In another embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide includes an antibody having a light chain acid variable sequence of antibody 1 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:8). In another embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide includes an antibody having a heavy chain variable sequence of antibody 1 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:7). In another embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide includes an antibody having a light chain variable sequence of antibody 1 (SEQ ID NO: 8) and a heavy chain variable sequence of antibody 1 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:7). In another embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide includes an antibody having a light chain acid variable sequence of antibody 2 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:18). In another embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide includes an antibody having a heavy chain variable sequence of antibody 2 (SEQ ID NO.16). In another embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide includes an antibody having a light chain variable sequence of antibody 2 (SEQ ID NO: 18) and a heavy chain variable sequence of antibody 2 (SEQ ID Νο.:16). In one embodiment, the antibody includes a heavy chain amino acid sequence having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antibody 1 or antibody 2. The terms CDR region or CDR, refer to the hypervariable regions of the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin as defined by Kabat et al. (Kabat, Ε. A. et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Edition. US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Service, NIH, Washington or later editions) or Chothia and Lesk (J. Mol. Biol., 196:901 -917 (1987)). An antibody typically contains 3 heavy chain CDRs and 3 light chain CDRs. The term CDR or CDRs is used here in order to indicate, according to the case, one of these regions or several, or even the whole, of these regions which contain the majority of the amino acid residues responsible for the binding by affinity of the antibody for the antigen or the epitope which it recognizes. Among the six short CDR sequences, the third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) has a greater size variability (greater diversity essentially due to the mechanisms of arrangement of the genes which give rise to it). It may be as short as 2 amino acids although the longest size known is 26. CDR length may also vary according to the length that can be accommodated by the particular underlying framework. Functionally, HCDR3 plays a role in part in the determination of the specificity of the antibody. One of skill in the art is able to determine CDR regions of an antibody. In general, HCDR1 is about 5 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 31-35; HCDR2 is about 17 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 50-65; HCDR3 is about 11 or 12 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 95-102, optionally including Kabat residue 100D; LCDR1 is about 11 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 24-34; LCDR2 is about 7 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 50-56; and LCDR3 is about 8 or 9 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 89-97, optionally including Kabat residue 95. In one embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide is an antibody or binding fragment thereof that includes a light chain amino acid sequence that includes one or more light chain CDR sequences for antibody 1 selected from LCDR1 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:4); LCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 5), LCDR3 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:6), and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide is an antibody that includes a heavy chain amino acid sequence that includes one or more of the heavy chain CDR sequences for antibody 1 selected from HCDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 1); HCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 2), HCDR3 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:3), and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide is an antibody or binding fragment thereof that includes a light chain amino acid sequence that includes LCDR1 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:4); LCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 5), and LCDR3 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:6) from antibody 1 and a heavy chain amino acid sequence that includes HCDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 1); HCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 2) and HCDR3 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:3) of antibody 1. In one embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide is an antibody or binding fragment thereof that includes a light chain amino acid sequence that includes one or more light chain CDR sequences for antibody 2 selected from LCDR1 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:12); LCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 13), LCDR3 (SEQ ID ΝΟ:14), and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide is an antibody that includes a heavy chain amino acid sequence having one or more of the heavy chain CDR sequences for antibody 2 selected from HCDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 9); HCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 10), HCDR3 (SEQ ID NO: 11), and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide is an antibody or binding fragment thereof that includes a light chain amino acid sequence that includes LCDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 12); LCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 13), and LCDR3 (SEQ ID NO: 14) from antibody 2 and a heavy chain amino acid sequence that includes HCDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 9); HCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 10) and HCDR3 (SEQ ID NO: 11) of antibody 2. 4.4 Purification The first step in the recovery of a recombinantly produced polypeptide (also referred to herein as a “target polypeptide” or “target”) from a cell culture is the removal of intact host cells and host cell debris from the culture media, referred to as “harvesting,” to yield a clarified cell culture supernatant that contains the recombinantly produced polypeptide along with other remaining impurities. Harvesting is generally accomplished by centrifugation, flocculation/precipitation, depth filtration and sterile filtration, although other approaches can be used. Recombinantly produced antibodies can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. When the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from the expression system can be concentrated, for example, using a commercially available protein concentration filter, such as an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor or protease inhibitor cocktail that includes one or more protease inhibitor such as bestatin, aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, 4-(2-Aminoethyi) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), pr phenylmethanesulfonylfiuoride (PMSF) may be included to inhibit proteolysis. In other embodiments, one or more antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants. Examples of suitable antibiotics include, but are not limited to, actinomycin D, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefotaxime, fosmidomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, penicillin, polymyxin Β, and streptomycin. After the clarified cell culture supernatant has been obtained, the target polypeptide can be further purified by removal of other impurities in the cell culture supernatant that may include, but are not limited to, host cell proteins (HOP), DNA, adventitious and endogenous viruses, endotoxin, aggregates and other species. Most purification methods involve some form of chromatography in which target molecules in solution (mobile phase) are separated based on a difference in chemical or physical interaction with a stationary material (solid phase). General chromatographic methods and their use are known to persons skilled in the art. See for example, Sambrook, J., et al. (eds.), Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, Ν.Υ., 1989. Many different methods for recombinant polypeptide purification are known, and include, but are not limited to affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis and combinations thereof. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, isoeletric focusing, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin, SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation can also be included in the purification process. Often, a combination of different purification processes are used, such that the different processes separate the polypeptide based on different principles, such as affinity, charge, degree of hydrophobicity, and/or size. Many different chromatography resins are available for each technique, such that a purification scheme can be tailored to the particular recombinant polypeptide. Column chromatography can be performed with automated systems, such as the GE Healthcare ΑΚΤΑ AVANT system, which use a pump to force solvent over a packed column at a set flow rate, or can be run by gravity flow. Both automated and gravity flow systems can be coupled to automatic fraction collecting systems. In one embodiment, a combination of purification processes is employed as a purification scheme. One example of purification scheme 100 is shown as a flow chart in Figure 1. The sample purification scheme 100 includes a first step in which the recombinant polypeptide is produced, for example, by expression in a host cell and harvested 101. Methods for recombinant polypeptide production and harvesting are discussed above. The recombinant polypeptide is then captured 102, for example, using affinity chromatography. In one embodiment, the recombinant polypeptide is an antibody and Protein A affinity chromatography is used for capture 102. The purification process can also include one or more polishing chromatography steps 104, 105. To improve viral clearance, a viral inactivation step 103 and/or a viral filtration step 106 may also be included in the purification scheme 100. Lastly, the purified product can be concentrated and diafiltered into a final formulation buffer 107. It is noted that the scheme provided in Figure 1 is merely an example, and variations, for example, in the order of steps, number of steps, and purification methods used for each step, are well within the abilities of one of skill in the art. In one embodiment, capture 102 is accomplished by affinity chromatography. Affinity chromatography refers to a chromatographic method in which a biomolecule such as a recombinantly produced polypeptide is separated based on a specific reversible interaction between the polypeptide and a binding partner covalently coupled to the solid phase. Examples of affinity interactions include, but are not limited to the reversible interaction between an antigen and antibody, enzyme and substrate, or receptor and ligand. In one embodiment, affinity chromatography involves the use of microbial proteins, such as Protein A or Protein G. Protein A is a bacterial cell wall protein that binds to mammalian IgGs primarily through their Fc regions. Protein A resin is useful for affinity purification and isolation of a variety antibody isotypes, particularly IgGi, lgG2, and lgG4. There are many Protein A resins available that are suitable for use in the purification process described herein. The resins are generally classified based on their backbone composition and include, for example, glass or silica-based resins; agarose-based resins; and organic polymer based resins. In one embodiment, Protein A affinity chromatography is used to capture a recombinantly produced antibody. The flow rate through an affinity chromatography support is an important parameter for optimizing separation. Although a reduced separation time may be desirable, a flow rate that is too fast a flow may cause the mobile phase to move past the solid phase faster than the diffusion time necessary to reach the internal bead volume. Generally, a flow rate of at least about 50 cm/h, 100 cm/h, 150 cm/h, 200 cm/hour or 250 cm/hour and up to about 300 cm/hour, 350 cm/hour, 400 cm/hour, 450 cm/hour or 500 cm/hr is used. The column dimensions can also be varied. While laboratory bench scale columns generally have a column diameter of less than 1 cm, or less than 5 cm, large scale or commercial production scales can use columns having diameters of up to 1 meter or even up to 2 meters. For large scale or commercial production, the column bed height is generally at least about 10 cm, 15 cm or 20 cm, and up to about 25 cm or 30 cm. The composition of the buffer solutions and the volume of buffer solutions used in connection with Protein A purification can be varied. The term "buffer" or "buffered solution" refers to a solution that is able to resist changes in pH. Often a buffer is made of a weak conjugate acid-base pair, for example, a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. In some buffers, the buffering agent is supplied as a crystalline acid or base, for example, Tris is supplied as a crystalline base, which is dissolved in water to form a buffering solution. The pH of the buffering solution can be adjusted using an appropriate acid or base. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCI) can be used to adjust the pH of a Tris buffering solution. Other buffers are prepared by mixing two components, such as a free acid or base and a corresponding salt, in ratios that achieve the desired pH. For example, a sodium citrate buffer solution can be made and adjusted to the desired pH by combining citric acid and trisodium citrate to form a solution with the desired pH. Other buffers are made by mixing a buffer component and its conjugate acid or base. For example, a phosphate buffer can be made by mixing monobasic and dibasic sodium phosphate solutions in a ratio to achieve a desired pH. In another embodiment, a sodium bicarbonate buffer system can be prepared by combining solutions of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate to form a buffer solution having a desired pH. In one embodiment, the column is equilibrated with an “equilibration buffer” prior to loading. The term “equilibration buffer” refers to a buffer that can be used to remove undesired residual from the column matrix and to prepare the solid phase of the column matrix for loading the target protein, for example, by adjusting the pH of the column. When used for antibody purification, the pH of the equilibration buffer is at least about 6.0, 6.1,6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1,7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9, and up to about 8.0, 8.1,8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, or 9.0. In one embodiment, the equilibration buffer includes a buffering agent such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (often referred to as “Tris”) (pH range 5.8-8.0), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH range 6.8-8.2), 3-(Νmorpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) (pH range 6.5-7.9) or other phosphate buffering agents (pH 5.8-8.0) at a concentration of at least about 10 mM, 25 mM, 50 mM or 75 mM and up to about 100 mM, 125 mM or 150 mM. In one embodiment, the pH of the buffering solution can be adjusted using an appropriate acid or base, such as hydrochloric acid (HCI) or sodium hydroxide/potassium hydroxide (NaOH/KOH). In one embodiment, the equilibration buffer includes at least about 10 mM, 15 mM, or 20 mM and up to about 25 mM, 30 mM, 50 mM or 100 mM sodium phosphate at a pH of at least about 6.0, 6.1,6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1,7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9, and up to about 8.0, 8.1,8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, or 9.0. Additionally, the buffer may include one or more additives to increase protein purity, stability, and function, including, but not limited to reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol (ΒΜΕ), dithiothreiotol (DDT) or Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to protect against oxidative damage, protease inhibitors, including but not limited to leupeptin, pepstatin A and phenylmethanesuifonyifiuoride (PMSF) to inhibit endogenous proteases from degrading the target polypeptide, metal chelators, including but not limited to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), to inactivate metalloproteases, osmolytes, including but not limited to glycerol, detergents and sugars to stabilize protein structure or ionic stabilizers, including but not limited to salts such as NaCI, KOI and (NH4)2S04 to enhance solubility. In one embodiment, the column is equilibrated using at least about 5, and up to about 10 or 20 column volumes of the equilibration buffer prior to loading the recombinantly produced polypeptide onto the column. In one embodiment, a clarified cell culture supernatant is loaded onto the column. In one embodiment, the clarified cell culture supernatant is loaded onto the column after the column has been equilibrated with an equilibration buffer. In a further embodiment, the clarified cell culture supernatant is loaded onto the column in combination with a loading buffer. The term "loading buffer" refers to a buffer that is combined with a composition that includes the target polypeptide prior to loading the target onto a column. In general, the target polypeptide is loaded at a concentration of at least about 1 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 15 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml or 25 mg/ml and up to about 30 mg/ml, 35 mg/ml, 40 mg/ml, 45 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 75 mg/ml or 100 mg/ml. In one embodiment, clarified cell culture supernatant is diluted with a loading buffer at a ratio of about 1:1, 1:2 or 1:3, for example, to achieve a desired concentration for the target polypeptide and/or to adjust the pH of the solution. In other embodiments, the clarified cell culture supernatant is loaded directly onto the column (i.e., the supernatant is not diluted with a loading buffer). In one embodiment, the column is re-equilibrated with an equilibration buffer after the clarified cell culture supernatant has been loaded. In a more particular embodiment, the column is re-equilibrated with at least about 5 and up to about 10 or 20 column volumes of the equilibration buffer or loading buffer after the target polypeptide is loaded onto the column. In general, the target polypeptide is loaded onto the Protein A column at a pH of at least about 6.0, 6.1,6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1,7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9, and up to about 8.0, 8.1,8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, or 9.0. In some embodiments, the loading buffer is the same as the equilibration buffer. In other embodiments, the loading buffer and the equilibration buffer are not the same. In other embodiments, the loading buffer is also used as a wash buffer to wash the column after loading. In one embodiment, the loading buffer includes a buffering agent such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (often referred to as “Tris”) (pH range 5.8-8.0), 4-(2-hydroxyethyi)-1-piperazineethanesuifonic add (HEPES) (pH range 6.8-8.2), 3-(Νmorpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) (pH range 6.5-7.9) or other phosphate buffering agents, such as sodium phosphate or phosphate-citrate buffers (pH 5.8-8.0) at a concentration of at least about 10 mM, 20 mM, 30 mM, 40 mM or 50 mM and up to about 60 mM, 70 mM, 80 mM, 90 mM, or 100 mM. In one embodiment, the pH of the buffering solution can be adjusted using an appropriate acid or base, such as hydrochloric acid (HCI) or sodium hydroxide/potassium hydroxide (NaOH/KOH). When used for antibody purification, the pH of the loading buffer is generally adjusted to at least about 6.0, 6.1,6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1,7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9, and up to about 8.0, 8.1,8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, or 9.0. In a more particular embodiment, the loading buffer includes at least about 10 mM, 15 mM or 20 mM and up to about 25 mM, 30 mM, 50 mM or 100 mM sodium phosphate at has a pH of at least about 6.0, 6.1,6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9, and up to about 8.0, 8.1,8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, or 9.0. In one embodiment, the column is re-equilibrated after loading using at least about 5, and up to about 10 or 20 column volumes of the equilibration or loading buffer. Additionally, the equilibration buffer may include one or more additives to increase protein purity, stability, and function, including, but not limited to reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol (ΒΜΕ), dithiothreiotol (DDT) or Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to protect against oxidative damage, protease inhibitors, including but not limited to leupeptin, pepstatin A and phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF) to inhibit endogenous proteases from degrading the target polypeptide, metal chelators, including but not limited to Ethyienediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), to inactivate metalloproteases, osmolytes, including but not limited to glycerol, detergents and sugars to stabilize protein structure or ionic stabilizers, including but not limited to salts such as NaCI, KOI and (NH4)2S04 to enhance solubility. The term "wash buffer" refers to a buffer that is passed over the column material after the target composition has been loaded onto the column and prior to elution of the recombinantly produced target polypeptide. The wash buffer may serve to remove one or more contaminants, for example, host cell protein, from the column material, without substantial elution of the target. In general, the wash buffer has a pH of at least about 6.0, 6.1,6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1,7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9, and up to about 8.0, 8.1.8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, or 9.0. In one embodiment, the process includes one wash buffer, wherein the column is washed using at least about 5, or up to about 10 or 20 column volumes of a single wash buffer. In other embodiments, the process may include more than one wash buffer, for example, the process may include two different wash buffers. For example, the process may include a first wash step in which the column is washed using at least about 5, or up to about 10 or 20 column volumes of a first wash buffer and a second wash step in which the column is washed using at least about 5, or up to about 10 or 20 column volumes of a second wash buffer. In one embodiment, at least one wash buffer is the same as the equilibrating buffer. In another embodiment, at least one wash buffer is different from the equilibration buffer. In a further embodiment a purification process is described in which residual levels of host cell protein (HOP) in eluate from a Protein A purification are reduced. In a more particular embodiment, residual HOP levels are reduced by including a fatty acid in a wash buffer used with the Protein A column. In one embodiment, a method of separating a recombinantly produced polypeptide from host cell protein is described. In another embodiment, a method for enhancing stability of a recombinantly produced polypeptide is described. In another embodiment, a method for reducing protease contamination in a formulation containing a recombinantly produced polypeptide is provided. In general, short chain fatty acids, for example, fatty acids having a chain length of less than about 6 carbon atoms, do not significantly alter the level of HOP in the eluate. However, as fatty acid chain length is increased, a reduction in HOP is observed. In particular, inclusion of fatty acids with a medium chain length (i.e., between about 6 carbon atoms and about 12 carbon atoms) in the wash buffer significantly reduces the amount of HOP observed in the eluate. Examples of suitable fatty acids or fatty acid salts for inclusion in a Protein A wash buffer include, but are not limited to, fatty acids having a chain length of at least about 6, 7, 8 or 9 carbon atoms and up to about 10, 11 or 12 carbon atoms, or fatty acid salts thereof including, but not limited to, enanthic acid, caprylic acid, pelargonic acid, capric acid, undecyclic acid, lauric acid or combinations and salts thereof. In one embodiment, the fatty acid is included in a wash buffer at a concentration of at least about 25 mM or 50 mM, and up to about 75 mM, 100 mM, 125 mM, 150 mM or 200 mM. In one embodiment, the wash buffer includes a fatty acid solution prepared using a buffering agent such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (often referred to as “Tris”) (pH range 5.8-8.0), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH range 6.8-8.2), 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) (pH range 6.5-7.9), wherein the fatty acid has a concentration of at least about 25 mM or 50 mM, and up to about 75 mM, 100 mM, 125 mM, 150 mM or 200 mM and the buffering agent has a concentration of at least about 10 mM, 25 mM, 50 mM or 75 mM and up to about 100 mM, 125 mM or 150 mM and the solution has a pH of at least about 6.0, 6.1,6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1,7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9, and up to about 8.0, 8.1,8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, or 9.0. In one embodiment, the pH of the buffering solution can be adjusted using an appropriate acid or base, such as hydrochloric acid (HCI) or sodium hydroxide/potassium hydroxide (NaOH/KOH). While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the fatty acid removes HCPs by out-competing with the HCPs for binding sites on the antibody. For example, the level of host cell proteins can be reduced to 75%, 50%, 25%, 10% or even as low as 5% of the level of host cell proteins in eluate obtained from a column that was washed with a control buffer that does not include a fatty acid. In another embodiment, the level of host cell proteins can be reduced at least 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 5 fold, 10 fold, 15 fold, 20 fold, 25 fold and up to 30 fold, 35 fold, 40 fold, 45 fold or 50 fold when compared to the level of host cell proteins obtained using a wash that does not include a fatty acid. In another embodiment, inclusion of a fatty acid in a Protein A wash can increase stability of a recombinantly produced polypeptide, such as an antibody, obtained from the Protein A purification. In one embodiment, inclusion of a fatty acid in a Protein A wash reduces protease activity, which can improve stability of the recombinantly produced polypeptide, for example, recombinantly produced antibody. In one embodiment, inclusion of a fatty acid in a Protein A wash reduces activity of proteases such as serine proteases, aspartyl proteases such as cathepsin-D, cysteine proteases, metalloproteases and aminopeptidases in the eluate or in a downstream formulation containing the recombinantly produced polypeptide obtained from the Protein A purification step. The reduction of protease activity can be measured using any suitably sensitive assay, including, but not limited to EnzChek® Protease Assay Kit Ε6638 from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Any assay that can reliably detect or quantify levels >10 ng/mL for control preparations of proteases such as the aspartyl protease, Cathepsin-D, or the serine protease, Trypsin may also be used. In another embodiment, inclusion of a fatty acid in a Protein A wash results in a reduction in particle formation, which is related to product stability, in the eluate or in a downstream formulation containing the recombinantly produced polypeptide obtained from the Protein A purification step. In another embodiment inclusion of a fatty acid in a Protein A wash results in a reduction in delayed-onset particle formation, which is related to product stability, in the eluate or in a downstream formulation containing the recombinantly produced polypeptide obtained from the Protein A purification step. Particle formation can be determined by visual inspection. For example, visual inspection for particles, clarity/opalescence, and color can be performed based on procedures adapted from the European Pharmacopeia (PhEur) sections 2.9.20, 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, respectively. Particles levels in samples can be compared against a series of barium sulfate visible particle standards. As an example, the standards that can be used include: ‘free from visible particles’ (0); four gradations of ‘practically free from visible particles’ (1 through 4); and three gradations of ‘contains visible particles’ (5, 6, and 7). In one embodiment, any sample designated as ‘contains visible particles’ is dispositioned as a ‘fail.’ In one embodiment, opalescence can be assessed by comparison with dilutions of a stabilized formazin standard (2660642) obtained from Hache-Lange (Loveland, CO). Color can be assessed by comparison with standards (83952) from Sigma-Fluke (St. Louis, MO). As used herein, the term “delayed-onset” refers to particle formation that, while not observed in the formulation initially, form after a period of time, for example, after 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months or up to 12 months, 18 months or 24 months. In one embodiment, particle formation is reduced when a formulation containing the recombinantly produced polypeptide is stored at a temperature at or at least about 0°C, 5°C or 10 °Cknd at or up to about 25°C or 40°C. In another embodiment, inclusion of a fatty acid in a Protein A wash results in reduction of polypeptide fragmentation, which is also related to product stability, in the eluate or in a downstream formulation. In one embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide in a formulation downstream of a purification process in which a fatty acid was included in at least one Protein A wash has a fragmentation rate of less than 5%, 4.5%, 4%, 3.5%, 3%, 2.5%, 2%, 1.5%, 1%, 0.95%, 0.90%, 0.80% or 0.75% per month when stored at 40 °C. Methods for detecting polypeptide fragmentation are known and include, for example, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). In addition to the fatty acid, other elements of the wash buffer can impact the level of HOP detected in the eluate. In particular, as the pH of the wash buffer is increased, the HOP level may decrease. Additionally, the concentration of salt, such as sodium chloride, in the wash buffer can also impact the level of HOP detected in the eluate. In general, as the concentration of salt or sodium chloride increases, the HOP level in the eluate decreases. In one embodiment, the wash buffer has a pH of at least about 6.0, 6.1,6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1,7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9, and up to about 8.0, 8.1,8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, or 9.0 and includes at least about 0.25 Μ, 0.5 Μ, 1 Μ, 1.25 Μ, 1.5Μ, 1.75 Μ or 2Μ salt, such as sodium chloride and up to about 2.0 Μ, 2.25 Μ, 2.5 Μ, 2.75 Μ or 3.0 Μ salt, such as sodium chloride and a fatty acid at a concentration of at least about 25 mM or 50 mM, and up to about 75 mM, 100 mM, 125 mM, 150 mM or 200 mM. In one embodiment, the wash buffer includes between about 50 mM and about 100 mM sodium caprylate at a pH between about 8 to about 9. In another embodiment, the wash buffer includes between about 50 mM and about 100 mM sodium caprylate at a pH between about 8 to about 9 and between about 2.0 Μ to about 2.5 Μ sodium chloride. In a more particular embodiment, the wash buffer includes between about 50 mM to about 100mM sodium caprylate in 100mM Tris at a pH between about 8.0 and about 9.0. In a more particular embodiment, the wash buffer includes about 50 mM to about 100mM sodium caprylate in 100mM Tris at a pH between about 8.0 and about 9.0 and between about 2.0 Μ and about 2.5 Μ sodium chloride. Additionally, the wash buffer may include one or more additives to increase protein purity, stability, and function, including, but not limited to reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol (ΒΜΕ), dithiothreiotol (DDT) or Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to protect against oxidative damage, protease inhibitors, including but not limited to leupeptin, pepstatin A and phenylmethanesuifonylfluoride (PMSF) to inhibit endogenous proteases from degrading the target polypeptide, metal chelators, including but not limited to Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), to inactivate metalloproteases, osmolytes, including but not limited to glycerol, detergents and sugars to stabilize protein structure or ionic stabilizers, including but not limited to salts such as NaCI, KOI and (NH4)2S04 to enhance solubility. The term "elution buffer" refers to a buffer used to elute (i.e., remove) the target polypeptide from the column. The elution pH can vary depending upon the binding affinity of the polypeptide to the column. Some antibodies demonstrate a higher binding affinity and may require a lower elution pH. In general, the pH of the elution buffer is lower than the pH of the loading buffer. Typically, the elution buffer has a pH of at least about 2.0, 2.1,2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1,3.2, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5 and up to about 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1,4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 or 5.0. Examples of elution buffers include buffers including sodium citrate, citric acid or acetic acid at a concentration of at least about 25 mM, 50 mM and up to about 100 mM, 150 mM or 200 mM. In one embodiment, the elution buffer includes at least about 25 mM, 50 mM and up to about 100 mM, 150 mM or 200 mM sodium citrate at has a pH of at least about 2.0, 2.1,2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1,3.2, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5 and up to about 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1,4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 or 5.0. Additionally, the elution buffer may include one or more additives to increase protein purity, stability, and function, including, but not limited to reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol (ΒΜΕ), dithiothreiotol (DDT) or Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to protect against oxidative damage, protease inhibitors, including but not limited to leupeptin, pepstatin A and phenylmetbanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF) to inhibit endogenous proteases from degrading the target polypeptide, metal chelators, including but not limited to Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), to inactivate metalloproteases, osmolytes, including but not limited to glycerol, detergents and sugars to stabilize protein structure or ionic stabilizers, including but not limited to salts such as NaCI, KOI and (NH4)2S04 to enhance solubility. In one embodiment, the target molecule is eluted using at least 5 and up to 10 or up to 20 column volumes of elution buffer. The eluate can be monitored using techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example by monitoring the absorbance using a spectrophotometer set at OD280 nm. In one embodiment, the Protein A purification step has a recovery rate of at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84% or 85% and up to about 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90% or 95%. Recovery can be determined, for example, by calculating the percentage of protein in the Eluate relative to the amount that was loaded onto the column. Polishing chromatography steps 104, 105 provide additional viral, host cell protein (HOP), endotoxin and DNA clearance, as well as assist in the removal of aggregates, unwanted product variants and other minor contaminants. Polishing steps 104, 105 generally include one or more chromatographic steps such as ion exchange chromatography, mixed mode chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the purification process includes at least one ion exchange chromatography step. The term "ion exchange chromatography" refers to a chromatographic process using an immobile matrix that carries covalently bound charged substituents. The "ion exchange material" has the ability to exchange its counter ions, which are not covalently bound, for similarly charged binding partners or ions in the surrounding solution. Polypeptides have numerous functional groups that can have either positive or negative charges. Ion exchange chromatography separates polypeptides based on net charge, which is dependent on the pH and/or ionic concentration of the mobile phase. Polypeptides can thus be separated by adjusting the pH and/or ionic concentration of the mobile phase. In some embodiments, the target polypeptide is captured by the column and then eluted (also referred to as “bind and elute” mode). In other embodiments, the target polypeptide flows through the column and contaminants are bound (also referred to as a “flow through mode”). Elution from an ion exchange material is generally achieved by increasing the ionic strength of the buffer to compete with the recombinant polypeptide for charged sites of the ion exchange matrix. The elution process be gradual (gradient elution) or stepwise (step elution) and the eluate can be monitored using a UV spectrophotometer set at OD280 nm. Depending on the charge of the counter ions, "ion exchange chromatography" can be referred to as "cation exchange," "anion exchange," or “mixed-mode ion exchange.” The term "cation exchange" refers to a chromatographic method having a solid phase that is negatively charged with free cations available for exchange with cations in an aqueous solution passed over or through the column. Cation exchange chromatography can be used to purify a recombinant polypeptide if the target is maintained under conditions in which the target polypeptide is positively charged. For example, the solution can be titrated so that the solution pH is lower than the isoelectric point of the polypeptide. Other positively charged impurities may also be bound to the cationic column resin in addition to the target polypeptide. As such, the target polypeptide can be recovered by elution from the column under conditions (e.g., pH and salt concentration) in which the target polypeptide elutes while impurities remain bound to the resin. Cation exchange resins can include strong acidic ligands such as sulphopropyl, sulfoethyl and sulfoisobutyl groups or weak acidic ligand such as carboxyl groups. Examples of commonly used cation exchange resins include carboxymethyl (CM), sulfoethyl(SE), sulfopropyl(SP), phosphate(P) and sulfonate(S) resins. The term "anion exchange" refers to a chromatographic method having a solid phase that is positively charged with free anions available for exchange with anions in an aqueous solution passed over or through the solid phase. The anion exchange columns are typically operated in a flow through mode, such that negatively charged impurities are bound to the resin while the positively charged target polypeptide is recovered in the flow through stream. However, anion exchange columns may also be used in a bind and elute mode, depending upon the pi of the target polypeptide and the impurities to be removed. Examples of positively charged groups that are used in anion exchange include weakly basic groups such as diethylamino ethyl (DEAE) or dimethylamino ethyl (DMAE) and strongly basic groups such as quaternary amine(Q) groups, trimethylammonium ethyl (ΤΜΑΕ) or quaternary aminoethyl (QAE). In one embodiment, the eluate obtained from the Protein A capture step 102 is subjected to one, more than one, or two ion exchange separation steps in which the second ion exchange separation involves a separation based on the opposite charge than the first ion exchange separation. For example, if an anion exchange step 104 is employed after capture 102, the second ion exchange chromatographic step 105 may be a cation exchange step. Conversely, if capture 102 was followed by a cation exchange step 104, that step would be followed by an anion exchange step 105. Alternately, in other embodiments the purification scheme 100 may include only a cationic exchange step or only an anionic exchange step. In one embodiment, the purification scheme 100 includes at least one a hydrophobic interaction separation as a polishing step 104 or 105. “Hydrophobic interaction chromatography” (HIC) refers to chromatographic separation based on the reversible interaction between a polypeptide and a hydrophobic ligand bound to the solid phase of the chromatography resin. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography is often used to remove protein aggregates, such as antibody aggregates, and process-related impurities. During HIC, the target polypeptide binds to the column at a high salt concentration and is eluted by decreasing the salt concentration. Since the interaction between the target polypeptide and the hydrophobic ligand are enhanced by the use of buffers with high ionic strength, HIC can be a suitable purification step for use after ion exchange chromatography. Various ions can be arranged in a so-called soluphobic series depending on whether they promote hydrophobic interactions (salting-out effects) or disrupt the structure of water (chaotropic effect) and lead to the weakening of the hydrophobic interaction. In other embodiments, the purification scheme can include “hydrophobic charge induction chromatography” (HCIC) as a polishing step 104 or 105. HCIC is based on the ρΗdependent behavior of ligands that ionize at low pH. HCIC employs heterocyclic ligands at high densities such that hydrophobic interaction between the target polypeptide and the column material are possible without the need for a high salt concentration. Elution in HCIC can be accomplished by lowering the pH to produce charge repulsion between the ionizable ligand and the bound protein. In one embodiment, the purification scheme 100 includes one or more viral inactivation 103 and/or viral clearance 106 steps, for example, to remove endogenous retroviruses and adventitious viruses. In one embodiment, a viral inactivation step 103 can be included after the target molecule is captured 102. Viral inactivation techniques are known and include, for example, heat inactivation (pasteurization), pH inactivation, disruption of the lipid envelope using solvent/detergent, UV and y-ray irradiation and the use of chemical inactivating agents. In one embodiment, viral inactivation includes a step of low pH viral inactivation, which includes incubating the mixture for a period of time at low pH, neutralizing the pH and removing particulates by filtration. In one embodiment, the low pH viral inactivation includes titrating the recombinant polypeptide to a pH between about 2 and about 5, or between about 3 and about 4, or between about 3.3 and about 3.8. The pH of the sample mixture may be lowered by any suitable acid including, but not limited to, citric acid, acetic acid, caprylic acid, or other suitable acids. The choice of pH level depends on the stability profile of the recombinantly produced polypeptide and other buffer components. Typically, the titrated solution is incubated for at least about 30 or 45 minutes and up to about 1, 1.5 hours, or 2 hours, typically at room temperature. After viral inactivation, the pH of the recombinant polypeptide solution can be adjusted to a more neutral pH, for example, between about 4.5 to about 8.5, or between about 4.5 and about 5.5 prior to continuing the purification process. In another embodiment, a viral clearance step 105, such as a viral filtration, can be included in the purification scheme. Virus-retentive filters are commercially available and include ultrafilters or microfilters such as hydrophilic polyethersulfone (PES), hydrophilic polyvinylidene (PVDF) and regenerated cellulose filters. Based on the size of viruses that are removed, virus filters can be categorized into retrovirus filters and parvovirus filters. In one embodiment, the purification scheme includes an ultrafiltration (UF) and/or diafiltration (DF) step 107 to further purify and concentrate the antibody sample. UF/DFcan increase the concentration of the target polypeptide as well as replace buffering salts with a particular formulation buffer. Ultrafiltration (UF) refers to a type of membrane filtration in which hydrostatic pressure forces a liquid against a semipermeable membrane. Suspended solids and solutes of high molecular weight, such as the target polypeptide, are retained in the retentate, while water and low molecular weight solutes pass through the membrane in the filtrate. In this manner, the target antibodies are concentrated as liquid and salt are removed. Generally, the low molecular weight composition in the concentrate remains constant so the ionic strength of the concentrated solution remains relatively constant. “Diafiltration” refers to a method that uses ultrafiltration membranes to remove, replace, or lower the concentrations of salts or buffering components from solutions containing proteins, such as antibodies, peptides, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules. Continuous diafiltration (also referred to as constant volume diafiltration) involves washing out the original buffer salts (or other low molecular weight species) in the retentate by adding water or a new buffer, such as a formulation buffer, to the retentate to form a formulation containing the recombinantly produced polypeptide. Typically, the new buffer is added at the same rate as filtrate is being generated such that the retentate volume and product concentration does not change appreciably during diafiltration. 4.5. Formulations In one embodiment, the purified recombinantly produced polypeptide is prepared in a liquid formulation. In a more particular embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide in the liquid formulation is an antibody or antibody fragment. In one embodiment, the liquid formulation includes an aqueous carrier, such as water. In one embodiment, the liquid formulation is sterile. In another embodiment, the liquid formulation is homogeneous. In another embodiment, the formulation is isotonic.

The formulation may also include common excipients and/or additives, including, but not limited to buffering agents, sugars, saccharides, salts, surfactants, solubilizers, diluents, binders, stabilizers, lipophilic solvents, amino acids, chelators, preservatives or combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the purified recombinantly produced polypeptide is prepared as a lyophilized formulation. In a more particular embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide in the lyophilized formulation is an antibody or antibody fragment. As used herein, the term “lyophilized” refers to a formulation that has been subjected to a drying procedure, such as lyophilization, where at least 50% of moisture has been removed. In one embodiment, the lyophilized formulation includes a lyoprotectant. The term “lyoprotectant” refers to a molecule which, when combined with a recombinantly produced polypeptide of interest, significantly prevents or reduced chemical and/or physical instability of the polypeptide upon lyophilization and subsequent storage. Lyoprotectants include, but are not limited to, sugars and their corresponding sugar alcohols; an amino acid such as monosodium glutamate, arginine or histidine; a methylamine such as betaine; a lyotropic salt such as magnesium sulfate; a polyol such as trihydric or higher molecular weight sugar alcohols, e.g. glycerin, dextran, erythritol, glycerol, arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol, and mannitol; propylene glycol; polyethylene glycol; Pluronics®; and combinations thereof. Additional examples of lyoprotectants include, but are not limited to, glycerin and gelatin, and the sugars mellibiose, melezitose, raffinose, mannotriose and stachyose. Examples of reducing sugars include, but are not limited to, glucose, maltose, lactose, maltulose, iso-maltulose and lactulose. Examples of non-reducing sugars include, but are not limited to, non-reducing glycosides of polyhydroxy compounds selected from sugar alcohols and other straight chain polyalcohols. Examples of sugar alcohols include, but are not limited to, monoglycosides, compounds obtained by reduction of disaccharides such as lactose, maltose, lactulose and maltulose. The glycosidic side group can be either glucosidic or galactosidic. Additional examples of sugar alcohols include, but are not limited to, glucitol, maltitol, lactitol and iso-maltulose. In specific embodiments, trehalose or sucrose is used as a lyoprotectant. In one embodiment, the lyoprotectant is added to the formulation in a "lyoprotecting amount" which means that, following lyophilization of the protein in the presence of the lyoprotecting amount of the lyoprotectant, the protein essentially retains its physical and chemical stability and integrity upon lyophilization and storage. A "reconstituted" formulation is one which has been prepared by dissolving a lyophilized formulation in a diluent such that the recombinantly produced polypeptide is dispersed in the reconstituted formulation. The reconstituted formulation is suitable for administration to a patient. The “diluents” includes pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, including, but not limited to, sterile water, bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), a pH buffered solution (e.g. phosphate-buffered saline), sterile saline solution, Ringer's solution or dextrose solution. In an alternative embodiment, diluents can include aqueous solutions of salts and/or buffers. In one embodiment, the recombinant polypeptide is included in a lyophilized formulation at a concentration of at least about 10 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml, 40 mg/ml or 50 mg/ml and up to about 60 mg/ml, 70 mg/ml, 80 mg/ml, 90 mg/ml or 100 mg/ml. In a more particular embodiment, the lyophilized formulation includes an amino acid, such as histdine, arginine or glutamic acid as a buffer at concentration of at least about 10 mM, 15 mM, 20 mM or 25 mM and up to about 30 mM, 40 mM or 50 mM. In one embodiment, the lyophilized formulation includes a sugar such as trehalose or sucrose at a concentration of at least about 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 175 mM, 200 mM or 225 mM and up to about 250 mM or 300 mM.

In one embodiment, the lyophilized formulation has a pH of at least about 6.0, 6.1,6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1,7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9, and up to about 8.0, 8.1,8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, or 9.0. In one embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide is formulated for parenteral administration. In one embodiment, the formulation is injectable. In one embodiment, the recombinantly produced polypeptide is formulated for intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular administration. The formulations prepared with a recombinantly produced polypeptide purified as described herein exhibit stability, low to undetectable levels of antibody fragmentation, low to undetectable levels of particle formation (i.e. remain free or practically free from visible particles and clear to slightly opalescent), low to undetectable levels of protease activity and very little to no loss of the biological activities of the recombinantly produced polypeptide during manufacture, preparation, transportation, and storage. The term "low to undetectable levels of fragmentation" as used herein refers to samples containing less than about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% of the full length polypeptide, for example, in a single peak as determined by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), representing the non-degraded polypeptide, and containing no other single peaks having more than about 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or 0.5% of the polypeptide in each. In another embodiment, the formulation exhibits reduced fragmentation of the recombinantly produced polypeptide. In one embodiment, a formulation that includes recombinantly produced polypeptide in which a fatty acid has been included in a Protein A wash buffer includes less than 5% fragmented polypeptides as determined by RP-HPLC upon storage at about 40°C for at least about 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days or 7 days; or at least about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks or 6 weeks. In another embodiment, a formulation that includes recombinantly produced polypeptide in which a fatty acid has been included in a Protein A wash buffer includes less than 5% fragmented polypeptides as determined by RP-HPLA upon storage at about 4°C or about 5°C for atieast about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks, 10 weeks, 11 weeks or 12 weeks; or at least about 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months or 12 months. The phrase "low to undetectable levels of particle formation" as used herein refers to samples which “remain free or practically free from visible particles and clear to slightly opalescent” upon visual inspection for particles and clarity/opalescence following procedures adapted from a suitable compendial method such as the European Pharmacopeia (PhEur) sections 2.9.20, 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 or samples in which no particles are detected (i.e., the formulation remains clear and colorless) upon visual inspection. In one embodiment, a formulation prepared with a recombinantly produced polypeptide purified as described herein is clear and colorless, as determined by visual inspection, upon storage at about 40 °C for at least about 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, or 7 days; or at least about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, or 6 weeks. In another embodiment, the formulation is clear and colorless, as determined by visual inspection, upon storage at about 4°C or about 5°C for at least about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks, 10 weeks, 11 weeks, or 12 weeks; or at least about 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, or 12 months. The term “low to undetectable protease activity” as used herein refers to samples in which protease activity is below the detection limit (for example, less than about 10 ng/mL), for example, using a fluorescent protease assay such as EnzChek® Protease Assay Kit (Ε6638, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). In one embodiment, a formulation prepared with a recombinantly produced polypeptide purified as described herein shows low to undetectable protease activity upon storage at about 40 °C for atleast about 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, or 7 days; or at least about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, or 6 weeks. In another embodiment, the formulation shows low to undetectable protease activity upon storage at about 4°C or about 5°C for at leaslabout 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks, 10 weeks, 11 weeks, or 12 weeks; or at least about 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, or 12 months. In one embodiment, the formulation exhibits improved stability of the recombinantly produced polypeptide. In particular, inclusion of a fatty acid in the Protein A wash buffer results in an antibody formulation having improved stability when compared to a formulation prepared using a Protein A wash buffer that does not include a fatty acid. In one embodiment, a formulation prepared with a recombinantly produced polypeptide purified as described herein is stable upon storage at about 40 °C for at least about 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, or 7 days; or at least about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, or 6 weeks; or at least about 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, or 6 months. In another embodiment, a formulation prepared with a recombinantly produced polypeptide purified as described herein is stable upon storage at about 4^ or about 5°C for at least about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks, 10 weeks, 11 weeks, or 12 weeks; or at least about 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, or 12 months; or at least about 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, 10 years, 11 years, or 12 years. 4.6. Host Cell Protein detection Methods for determining the residual levels of host cell protein (HOP) concentration are known and include, for example detecting residual HOP levels using an immunoassay, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for example, in which the primary antibody is specific to the HCPs produced from a particular host cell, e.g., CHO cells or Ε. coli cells, used to generate the recombinant polypeptide. The primary antibody may be produced according to conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. For example, the primary antibody may be generated against a cell lysate of the host cells used for antibody production. One HOP immunoassay platform is commercially available from Gyros (Warren, NJ). 4.5. Protease detection The EnzChek® Protease Assay Kit (Ε6638, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) can be used to assess protease activity in samples. Samples can be read at a single pH or at multiple pHs to generate a profile of protease activity vs pH. Different proteases have different activity vs. pH profiles and measurements at different pH levels therefore increases the ability to detect proteases of many different types in a sample. In another embodiment, the BODIPY fluorescence assay can be used over a pH range 4-9 with less than a ca. 10% error. The detection substrate in the kit is BODIPY®-casein conjugate. When dye-labeled fragments of digested casein substrate are released by active proteases in the samples there can be a fluorescence intensity increase due to decreased selfquenching of the dye. Protein samples can be diluted 10-fold into 20 mM citrate-phosphate buffer at pHs typically ranging from 4 to 8. Matching placebos can be prepared. The citrate-phosphate buffer can be prepared by mixing 20 mM citric acid and 20 mM dibasic sodium phosphate to achieve the desired pHs. The BODIPY®-casein conjugate detection substrate can be diluted in the appropriate buffer to generate a working reagent at each pH from 4 to 8 at about 10 pg/mL. An equal (typically 100 pL) volume of sample and working reagent can be added to wells in a white microplate to generate triplicate assay samples and matching placebos over the pH range 4 to 8. The samples can be sealed and incubated at 40 °C for a typical duration of 3 to 5 hours. The dye fluorescence can be excited at 485 nm and the emission intensity at 530 nm can be recorded using a 495 nm cutoff filter on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax® fluorescent plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA). The intensity vs. pH for the samples can then be recorded. Intensity increases of the sample compared to the blank of less than about 20% can be dispositioned as negative for protease activity per the manufacturer guidelines based on variability in the method. Results for samples can be buffer-subtracted and plotted vs. pH and can be used to determine the presence of protease activity in samples. Multiple replicates can be run to assess the variability for low readings. For relative quantification control preparations of known proteases such as Cathepsin-D or Trypsin as comparators can be used. To confirm the presence of proteases, protease inhibitors can be added to samples resulting in a relative decrease, or elimination of the detected protease activity as a confirmation of the results. Examples of protease inhibitors used to diagnose the presence of proteases in samples can include the broad protease inhibitor cocktail (Catalog No. Ρ2714, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Loius, MO) containing AEBSF, Aprotinin, Bestatin-HCI, Ε-64, EDTA, Leupeptin used at 1 χ suggested concentration. Each individual inhibitor can also be used for further confirmation of protease activity. Protease inhibitors are commercially available and can be sourced from a suitable supplier such as ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL: AEBSF-HCI (inhibits serine proteases), Catalog No. 78431 ; Aprotinin (inhibits serine proteases), Catalog No. 78432; Bestatin (inhibits Amino-peptidases), Catalog No. 78433; E-64 (inhibits cysteine proteases), Catalog No. 78434; Leupeptin (inhibits serine and cysteine proteases), Catalog No. 78435; Pepstatin-A (inhibits aspartyl proteases), Catalog No. 78436; EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, inhibits metalloproteases). 5.

Example 1: The effect of pH, sodium chloride and sodium caprylate on HOP levels Large amounts of HOP (i.e., 630 ng/mg) were observed in a standard purification process for a human lgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds human IL-18 (NCIMB Accession Number 41786), which was not cleared by Protein A purification or other process steps. Additional wash steps were evaluated for their ability to reduce HOP levels. In particular, the effects of wash pH, wash sodium chloride, sodium caprylate and combinations thereof on HOP clearance, recovery and product were examined. The experiment included 16 experimental runs plus an additional run using a standard wash buffer (run 17). The compositions of the experimental washes are shown in Table 1. All experimental wash buffers in Table 1 were made in 100mM Tris and pH adjusted using concentrated HCI. Protein A chromatography buffers were prepared as shown in Table 2. All runs were performed using a MabSelect SuRe column (C11 -032 TRICORN, GE Healthcare) having a bed height of 20 cm and a column volume of 3.93 mL and were performed overnight at 350 cm/hr (1.17 mL/min) using the ΑΚΤΑ AVANT system (GE Healthcare) according to the process outlined in Table 3.

The eluate was filtered using a Millipore Steriflip (Prod No. SCGP00525) to remove a precipitate associated with high HOP levels. Removal of this precipitate by filtration can help reduce HOP levels. Following filtration the neutralised eluate was further sampled for concentration determination, HOP assay (post filtration) and HPSEC. The concentration of each sample was determined by the adsorption at 280nm. Since all samples were diluted 1:20, the value was multiplied by 20 (to account for dilution) and divided by the extinction coefficient of 1.55 (experimentally determined). Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) analysis was performed on an Agilent HPLC system with a TSK-Gel G3000. 250 pg was injected by diluting the formulation to about 10 mg/mL in PBS and injecting 25 pL. Samples were analyzed for Host Cell Protein using an open immunoassay (Gyros) with affinity purified sheep antisera to detect HOP from CHO cells. A protease detection kit (23266 from Pierce Biotechnology) was used to measure activity of samples using FTC-Casein as the substrate. The procedures included in theinstructions were followed and the results were reported as units calculated as the ng/mL value for a Trypsin standard curve. The results are shown in Table 4. 4: Recovery, purity and HOP Purity (%) Pre Filtration Post Filtration Run Recovery (%) Agg Monomer Frag HCP (mg/mL) HCP (ng/mg) HCP (mg/mL) HCP (ng/mg) 1 84.80 1.85 98.15 0 6022.62 772.39 2757.66 382.32 2 83.19 2.4 97.6 0 3557.52 420.41 1785.85 226.15 3 83.64 2.8 97.2 0 4020.47 428.71 2615.26 306.17 4 87.58 2.6 97.4 0 5703.68 606.86 2418.31 279.31 5 82.44 2.2 97.8 0 2117.23 221.83 924.47 105.83 6 88.18 2.6 97.4 0 5926.16 577.56 2799.62 296.41 7 80.85 2.1 97.93 0 1020.41 105.70 743.01 83.45 8 88.89 2.7 97.3 0 17568.70 1618.22 3617.73 372.84 9 87.72 2.1 97.9 0 4854.61 556.89 3049.51 374.54 10 89.94 3.7 96.1 0.14 5288.24 599.00 3080.29 365.58 11 90.28 3.3 96.7 0 2784.78 327.75 2219.73 278.36 12 89.07 2.1 97.9 0 7030.49 769.58 2450.02 286.39 13 87.86 2.7 97.3 0 3465.77 359.95 2408.91 268.23 14 92.22 2.7 97.3 0 6080.68 601.70 3228.27 345.09 15 92.18 3.7 96.3 0 2490.16 241.45 1971.22 206.45 16 90.55 3 96.9 0.1 8430.85 838.00 4666.13 492.01 17 85.65 2.9 97.1 0 2677.29 293.06 2031.21 238.88 As can be seen in Table 4, the purity was significantly affected by each factor (pH, chloride and sodium caprylate) individually. Additionally, the results indicate an between sodium caprylate and sodium chloride. Table 5 shows the significance of the effect (Prob>F values greater than 0.05 would be to be not significant).

Increasing the pH had the biggest effect on eluate purity, resulting in a drop of 0.6% as the pH was increased from 7.0 to 9.0 when both wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate were at midpoint values (displayed in the top left corner). Figure 3 shows a reduction in the eluate purity as wash sodium chloride was increased in the absence of sodium caprylate (grey line). However, in the presence of sodium caprylate, this effect was reversed and the purity increased as the wash sodium chloride was increased (black line). Additionally, the results indicate that the individual factors (wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate) had a significant effect on recovery, again showing as an interaction between sodium caprylate and wash sodium chloride as can be seen by the quadratic interaction between wash sodium chloride and wash sodium chloride. The last column in Table 6 shows the significance of the effect. Table 6: Recovery Parameter "Prob>F Intercept 1 Wash ρΗ(7,9) 0.68717 Wash Sodium chloride (Μ)(0,2.5) 0.0003 Sodium caprylate (mM)(0,100) 0.00043 Wash pH*Wash Sodium chloride (Μ) 0.88387 Wash pH*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.92432 Wash Sodium chloride (M)*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.00032 Wash pH*Wash pH 0.85434 Wash Sodium chloride (M)*Wash Sodium chloride (Μ) 0.04666 Sodium caprylate (mM)*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.65567 The effects of wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate on recovery are shown in Figure 4. Wash sodium chloride is represented by a curved line - a representation of the quadratic interaction of wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate. The results in Figure 4 show that increasing wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate reduced the overall recovery by 2-4% each. Figure 5 shows that, as wash sodium chloride was increased in the absence of sodium caprylate (bottom left), there was a slight increase in recovery (grey line). However, in the presence of sodium caprylate, there was a reduction in recovery (black line). The effect of sodium caprylate and wash sodium chloride is demonstrated in the top right corner - with no wash sodium chloride present there was an increase in recovery as the sodium caprylate was increased (grey line). However there was a decrease in recovery in the presence of high wash sodium chloride (black line). The analysis for HOP pre-filtration identified a significant effect for all the individual factors (wash pH, wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate) as well as an interaction between sodium caprylate and wash pH and a wash pH with wash sodium chloride. The last column in Table 7 shows the significance of the effect. Table 7: HOP Pre-Filtration Parameter ,,Prob>Fu Intercept 1 Wash ρΗ(7,9) 0.0004 Wash Sodium chloride (Μ)(0,2.5) 0.00172 Sodium caprylate (mM)(0,100) 0.00014 Wash pH*Wash Sodium chloride (Μ) 0.01272 Wash pH*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.04634 Wash Sodium chloride (M)*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.55415 Wash pH*Wash pH 0.54008 Wash Sodium chloride (M)*Wash Sodium chloride (Μ) 0.31138 Sodium caprylate (mM)*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.62944 Increasing all three factors from low to high values resulted in a decrease in HOP levels in the eluate, suggesting that awash buffer at pH 9.0, with 2.5Μ Sodium chloride and 100mM sodium caprylate improved HOP clearance. This was confirmed experimentally. The lowest HOP levels achieved during the experiment was for run 7 (105.7mg/mg). In contrast, the highest HOP level was observed with low values for the three factors in run 8 (1618ng/mg). Additionally, two interactions were identified, which can be seen in Figure 6. The interaction between wash pH and wash sodium chloride can be seen in the left box, which shows that there was only a little effect on HOP levels pre-filtration when wash sodium chloride was increased at pH 9 (black line) but shows a larger effect when the pH was reduced to 7 (grey line). The effect was the same for sodium caprylate - while HOP levels pre-filtration were lower at pH 9 with and without sodium caprylate (black line), the level of reduction was greater as sodium caprylate levels were increased at pH 7 (grey line). The analysis identified a significant effect for all the individual factors (wash pH, wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate) for HOP levels post-filtration, as well as interactions between sodium caprylate and wash pH, sodium caprylate and wash sodium chloride and two quadratic interactions, one with wash pH the other with wash sodium chloride. The last column in Table 8 shows the significance of the effects. Table 8: HOP Post Filtration Parameter ”Prob>F” Intercept 1 Wash ρΗ(7,9) 0.00002 Wash Sodium chloride (Μ)(0,2.5) 0.00001 Sodium caprylate (mM)(0,100) 3.20Ε-08 Wash pH*Wash Sodium chloride (Μ) 0.78926 Wash pH*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.70475 Wash Sodium chloride (M)*Sodium caprylate (mM) 2.68Ε-06 Wash pH*Wash pH 0.02018 Wash Sodium chloride (M)*Wash Sodium chloride (Μ) 0.00916 Sodium caprylate (mM)*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.38244 Figure 7 shows HOP levels post-filtration with the two quadratic interactions represented by curved lines for wash pH and wash sodium chloride. The result for wash sodium chloride is interesting because the lowest HOP levels were achieved at high and low wash sodium chloride levels. This could be due to the samples with low wash sodium chloride having high HOP levels, which may have resulted in more turbidity and precipitation which was then removed by 0.2μηΐ filtration, thereby reducing the HOP level post-filtration. Figure 8 shows the interaction between wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate. In the absence of wash sodium chloride (grey line), less reduction in HOP post-filtration was observed than in the presence of 2.5Μ sodium chloride (black line). The combined effect of each factor (wash pH, wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate) on each response (purity, recovery, HOP pre-filtration and HOP post filtration) is shown in Figure 9. The columns on the right hand side show that, as the wash pH was increased the HOP levels decreased indicating that a higher pH is better for HOP clearance. However, purity decreased as pH increased - a trait that is generally not desirable. Figure 9 shows pH having no effect on recovery, because pH was not included in the model for recovery. The left hand column shows that increased wash sodium chloride reduced HOP. However, it also shows that increasing wash sodium chloride reduced recovery slightly and did not affect purity. The middle column shows that increasing sodium caprylate reduced HOP and increased purity. However, increasing sodium caprylate also reduced recovery. The predicted values using these conditions can be seen on the left hand axis. Figures 10A-C show the combined effects of the three factors on HOP levels pre-filtration. All three graphs show that the lowest HOP levels were achieved when the factors were at their highest as indicated by the contour grid. This indicates that, for HOP removal, increasing the levels further may result in additional clearance of HOP. However, it may not be desirable to remove all HCPs at the expense of 50% product recovery. To optimise the conditions for all responses, a desirability function was added to the model and ranges were set for each response and an importance assigned. The importance for HOP removal was given the highest importance, since this was the purpose of the wash step. Recovery was assigned a higher importance than purity, because this is a capture step and aggregates could be removed by the additional steps in the process. In Figure 11, the optimal condition is displayed on the X axis in which both wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate are still at the maximum values (i.e., 2.5 Μ and 100 mM, respectively), with a wash pH set at pH 8.45. Increasing the pH any further did not increase recovery or HOP clearance but did have a negative impact on purity. It is also important to note that a reasonably low recovery (81%) was observed under these conditions. For Protein A, a recovery of >90% would be expected. However, the wash sodium chloride was decreased to increase recovery, which in turn increased HOP levels. This suggests that the high levels of sodium chloride in the wash may have washed away product. The experiment demonstrated that sodium caprylate and pH can affect eluate purity. Although increasing pH resulted in lower purities (which is undesirable), this is the wash step on a capture column and there are additional chromatography steps in the process for the removal of aggregates. Additionally, the results indicate that addition of sodium caprylate to the wash buffer increased purity. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that sodium caprylate removed HCPs by out-competing for binding sites on the antibody. If this is the case, then it would also explain why purity increased. Although the effects of sodium caprylate and wash sodium chloride on recovery were not entirely desirable, this may be outweighed by the reduction in HOP levels. The results for HOP pre-filtration show that all three factors had the ability to reduce HOP levels when used in a Protein A wash buffer. Additionally, the results showed a synergistic interaction between wash pH and sodium caprylate that increased HOP clearance. Although the HOP levels post-filtration somewhat contradicted the HOP pre-filtration conclusions, the result for HOP pre-filtration were given more weight that the post-filtration levels because, even though the HCPs can be removed by filtration, the precipitate could block the filter making this less desirable in manufacturing. Example 2: Effect of pH, sodium chloride and sodium caprylate on HOP removal The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the effectiveness of three factors (pH, sodium chloride and sodium caprylate) and combinations thereof on HOP removal when included in a Protein A wash buffer for a second monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human interleukin-6 (IL-6). The procedure was the same as described for Example 1, above. The results are shown in Table 9. 9: Recovery, purity and HOP Run Recovery (%) Agg Monomer HCP (mg/mL) HCP (ng/mg) Relative protease activity (Intensity) at pH 7 after 5 hrs at 40C (ave of 3)* 1 89.6 1 99 5291.06 453.7 25 2 88.4 1 99 3487.82 270.4 28 3 91.1 0.9 99.1 18116.3 1306.0 23 4 92.8 0.8 99.2 13144.2 921.9 25 5 81.1 1.4 98.6 1879.88 142.6 0 6 97.2 0.9 99.1 26385.3 1773.5 44 7 96.4 2.2 97.8 1319.62 91.5 0 8 80.6 0.9 99.1 12386.9 969.9 61 9 93.4 1 99 35504.4 2637.4 51 10 91.2 1 99 8742.6 635.1 11 90.8 0.9 99.1 11230.2 803.5 29 12 94.3 1 99 13366.9 930.7 50 13 92.2 1 99 13428.6 938.0 33 14 83.0 0.9 99.1 16169.1 1274.2 15 85.0 0.8 99.2 10385.1 821.4 46 16 88.9 0.9 99.1 29621.7 2241.3 57 17 86.5 1.9 98.1 5972.23 474.6 0 The results in Table 10 show that purity was significantly affected by each factor (pH, chloride and sodium caprylate) individually. Additionally, the results indicate an between sodium caprylate and wash sodium chloride, and wash sodium chloride with pH. The effects of wash pH, sodium chloride and sodium caprylate on eluate purity are also shown in Figure 12. From this is can be seen that increasing the levels of all three resulted in a reduction in eluate purity. Figure 13 shows that, in the absence of sodium chloride, changing the levels of either theor sodium caprylate levels (black lines on left and right) had little effect on purity. in the presence of sodium chloride, there was a negative effect on the eluate purity either sodium caprylate or pH increased (grey line on left and right). The recovery only identified wash pH and its quadratic interaction as significant for recovery (Table 11). The results shown in Figure 14 indicate that increasing the pH resulted in higher recovery Interestingly, the analysis for HOP in eluate only identified sodium caprylate as a factor (Table 12). The impact of sodium caprylate on HOP levels in eluate is shown in15. Due to the large levels of noise in the model, an alternate analysis was performed. The alternate analysis was a standard least squares analysis of the log HOP in eluate HOP values. The results from the alternate analysis show that wash sodium chloride had a significant effect and that there was an interaction between sodium caprylate and wash sodium chloride, as well as the effect of sodium caprylate individually (Table 13).

Increasing sodium caprylate levels showed the greatest effect on HOP levels. The interaction between wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate can be seen in Figure 17. In the absence of sodium chloride, there was a small decrease in the levels of HOP as sodium caprylate was increased (grey line). However, in the presence of sodium chloride, there was a further reduction in clearance as sodium caprylate was increased (black line). The backward analysis for protease activity identified a significant effect for all the individual factors (wash pH, Wash Sodium chloride and sodium caprylate) as well as an interaction between sodium caprylate and wash pH, sodium caprylate and wash sodium chloride and wash pH and wash sodium chloride. The last column in Table 14 shows the significance of the effects. Table 14: Protease Activity Parameter "Prob>F" Intercept 1 Wash ρΗ(7,9) 0.01128 Wash NaCI (Μ)(0,2.5) 0.00097 Sodium caprylate (mM)(0,100) 0.00125 Wash pH*Wash NaCI (Μ) 0.05577 Wash pH*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.00985 Wash NaCI (M)*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.09843 Wash pH*Wash pH 0.26659 Wash NaCI (M)*Wash NaCI (Μ) 0.5699 Sodium caprylate (mM)*Sodium caprylate (mM) 0.44294 Figure 18 shows a clear decrease in protease activity for HOP levels post-filtration as each factor (wash pH, sodium chloride and sodium caprylate) was increased. Figure 19 shows the interaction of wash pH and sodium caprylate. In particular, in the presence of sodium caprylate, there was little difference in the activity. However, in the absence of sodium caprylate increasing the wash pH reduced protease activity. Figures 20Α and Β show the benefits of including sodium caprylate in the wash. Figure 20 A shows protease activity in the absence of sodium caprylate. Figure 20Β shows protease activity in the presence of sodium caprylate. The lowest activity was observed in the absence of sodium caprylate (A), with a high pH and sodium chloride concentration. In contrast, the highest activity was observed with low pH and sodium chloride levels. However, in the presence of sodium caprylate the contours changed (Β). The highest value was observed with high pH and no sodium chloride. As wash sodium chloride was increased, the contours flattened and the effect of pH was removed, since both pH 7 and 9 showed no activity. Figure 21 displays all the effects in a single graph. To improve HOP removal, wash sodium caprylate was set at the maximum value (i.e., 100 mM). (Figure 22) Wash pH was set at pH 8.1, since increasing the pH any further resulted in a decrease in recovery and wash sodium chloride was set at 1.9 Μ, since increasing sodium chloride levels any further reduced purity. The results confirm that sodium caprylate and pH impact eluate purity. However, in this example, increasing all three factors resulted in a decrease in purity whereas for the IL-18 antibody in Example 1, there was an increase in purity in the presence of sodium caprylate. The three factors had little impact on recovery, except that a reduction in recovery was observed when wash pH was decreased. However, this could be attributed to noise from the other factors. Only sodium caprylate significantly affected HOP in the eluate. When a log transformation was performed to transform the data into a linear model, the results indicated that increasing wash sodium chloride and sodium caprylate reduced HPC values. The same was true for pH, although the effect was not as significant. As seen in the IL-18 antibody in Example 1, the optimum conditions include all three factors at their high value. The effect on protease activity mirrored the overall effect on HOP, which was expected. The combination of the results indicates that combining all three factors provides an improved wash for HOP removal. Example 3: Evaluation of other fatty acids for HOP reduction The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the effectiveness of fatty acids other than sodium caprylate as constituents of a Protein A wash buffer on HOP removal for the monoclonal antibody used in Example 1 [an anti-IL-18 antibody]. The experiments were performed using the wash pH of 9.0 and 2.5Μ sodium chloride, the optimal conditions determined for the anti-IL-18 antibody in Example 1. All experimental wash buffers were made in 100mM Tris and pH adjusted using HCI orTris to achieve a final pH of 9.0. Based on solubility, some of the buffers included 2.5 Μ sodium chloride, while others were made without the 2.5 Μ sodium chloride, see Table 16. The Protein A chromatography buffers were prepared as described in Example 1 and the procedure was the same as described in Example 1. Table 15 provides a list of the unsaturated fatty acids and Table 16 provides the details for the experimental wash buffers.

The purity for all runs was lower than expected. However, the reduction in purity could be due to the age of the anti-IL-18 antibody clarified harvest. Consequently, only HOP clearance and recovery were evaluated and compared to the control runs from the previous Examples. Table 17: Results from fatty acid runs Run Fatty acid (100mM) Recovery (%) HCP Pre Filtration (ng mg) HCP Post Filtration (ng.mg) 1 Sodium Butyrate 82.7621 844.0165 458.1015 2 Butyric acid 84.77823 599.8767 418.207 3 Sodium Hexanoate 89.86984 502.5348 418.1989 4 Hexanoic acid 85.96452 408.2152 5 Sodium decanoate 79.20161 85.71799 140.7224 6 Denoic acid 75.82016 88.02499 138.5411 7 Sodium dodecanoate 41.01694 106.9883 8 Lauric acid 46.96774 99.34895 118.2844 Table 18: control wash buffers with no fatty acids Run Wash pH Recovery (°°) HCP Pre-Filtration (ng mg) HCP Post-Filtration (ng mg) 6 9 88.18 577.56 296.41 10 9 89.94 599.00 365.58 (from example 1) The recoveries from runs 1 -6 were comparable to those from the two control wash buffers. In runs 7 and 8, a significant reduction in recovery was observed (almost half that of the other runs). For these runs, a large peak was observed during the chromatography runs in the wash. Therefore, it appears that sodium dodecanoate and lauric acid result in a loss of recovery when added to a Protein A wash buffer. Figure 23 shows a large range in the levels of HOP levels pre-filtration: as high as 850ng/mg for run 1 (using the short chain fatty acid sodium butyrate) and down to 85ng/mg (using sodium dodecanoate). To determine whether these values demonstrate a decrease in eluate HOP, they were compared to the control buffer. Runs 1 -4 were run in 10OmM tris, 2.5Μ sodium chloride, pH 9.0 (plus the fatty acid at 100mM) and were compared to the second control run that also contained 2.5Μ sodium chloride (Table 18), which achieved a pre-filtration Protein A eluate HOP concentration of 599ng/mg. Therefore, it can be seen that both sodium butyrate and butric acid (runs 1 and 2) did not demonstrate increased clearance of HCPs at the level tested. The values for sodium hexanoate (run 3) are slightly lower than the control (500mg/mg compared with 599ng/mg) demonstrating a small reduction over the control. Sodium decanoate and denoic acid did not dissolve in the buffer containing 2.5Μ sodium chloride. Therefore, they should be compared to the buffer with no sodium chloride in (i.e., 100mM tris, pH 9.0). The reduction from 600ng/mg to 85 ng/ml and 97ng/mg for sodium decanoate and denoic acid, respectively, represent a significant reduction in HOP levels. This was lower than the result obtained for sodium caprylate (206ng/mg) obtained under the same conditions. For sodium dodecanoate and lauric acid, the results were 88 and 99ng/mg, respectively. However, the recovery was low (-45%). It is possible that the low recovery resulted in the low HOP levels, since it is possible that both product and HOP were washed from the column. However, further optimization could provide acceptable conditions for both HOP removal and recovery. The post-filtration results for runs 1 to 4 are comparable to those for pre-filtration. HOP levels were reduced post filtration, likely due to precipitate removal during filtration. The sodium decanoate and denoic acid runs (runs 5 and 6) demonstrated improved HOP removal as compared to the control wash conditions. Interestingly, the HOP levels were140 ng/mg and 139ng/mg, respectively, which were higher than the values pre-filtration. This could be due to an error in the HOP assay. Regardless of this variation, both the average and highest result represent a significant reduction in HOP levels compared to both the control buffer and the buffer containing sodium caprylate (Table 19). A summary of HOP levels in the eluate for the different fatty acid wash buffers is provided in Figure 23. control buffers Table19: Resu ts for sodium decanoate and denoic acid compared to Fatty Acid (100mM) HCP Pre Filtration (ng'mg) Pre Filtration Reduction over sodium caprylate Reduction over containing buffers buffers (mg.-mg) (ng'mg) sodium decanoate 85.72 120.72 491.84 decanoic acid 88.02 118.42 489.54 sodium caprylate 206.44 None 577.56 It is clear that there was a wide variation in the removal of HOP for the fatty acids assessed. The short chain fatty acids and their sodium salts; including sodium butyrate, butric acid, did not result in lower HOP levels than the buffer controls. However, as the fatty acid chain length increased, from 4 to 6 for sodium hexanoate and hexanoic acid a reduction in HOP was observed, from 844 ng/mg to 502ng/mg for the sodium salts and 844 ng/mg to 599ng/mg for the fatty acid. Sodium caprylate contains 8 carbon atoms and is classified as a medium chain fatty acid (7-12 carbon atoms). The results from the previous Examples demonstrated that sodium caprylate was able to reduce HOP levels to 206 mg/mg in a buffer containing 100mM sodium caprylate in 100mM Tris, pH 9. Similarly, the results for sodium decanoate, decanoic acid, sodium dodecanoate and lauric acid demonstrate that these fatty acids were also able to reduced HOP levels (to 150ng/mg), indicating that medium chain fatty acids have the ability to reduce HOP when included in a Protein A wash buffer. Because it is important to maintain a high recovery during antibody purification, for example, to reduce the cost of goods, the reduced recovery observed with sodium dodecanoate and lauric acid was not entirely desirable. However, when balanced against the reduction in HOP levels, the reduction in recovery may be acceptable. The results demonstrate that many fatty acids can be included in a Protein A wash buffer to reduce HOP levels. In general, the HOP levels were decreased as the chain length increased. In particular, the results suggest that medium chain length fatty acids may be the most desirable candidates due to the potentially undesirable effect on recovery observed with fatty acids having a chain length of 12 and the reduction of HOP removal observed with fatty acids having a chain length of 6. However, it may be possible to optimize the conditions to make these additional fatty acids viable components in Protein A wash buffers. Example 4: The effect of caprylate wash buffers on HOP removal during Protein A chromatography The purpose of this experiment was to test the effectiveness of caprylate wash buffers for the removal of host cell protein (HCPs) for anti-IL-18 antibody (NCIMB Accession No. 41786) during Protein A chromatography. Two forms of caprylate; sodium caprylate and caprylic acid were tested at a concentration of 50mM in a 100mM Tris buffer containing 2.5Μ sodium chloride, pH 9.0. Four chromatography runs were performed using a MabSelect SurRe matrix (GE Healthcare) in a Tricorn 0.5 mm column with a bed height of 20 cm and a column volume of 3.98 ml. at a linear flow rate of 350cm/hr. Prior to use, the column was sanitized with 2 column volumes of 0.5Μ sodium hydroxide followed by a 15 minute hold with. The process buffers and column volumes are shown in Table 20. After use, the column was sanitized with 2 column volumes of 0.5Μ sodium hydroxide followed by a 15 minute hold. For eluate peak collection, OD was started at 100mAU and ended at lOOmAU (0.5OD). All fractions were assayed at A28o for protein concentration and HOP was quantified using the Gyros HOP assay described in Example 1. Table 20: Process buffers and column volumes Column volumes Step Buffer Run 1 Run 2 Run 3 Run 4 Equilibration 20mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 5 5 5 5 Load Anti-IL-18 antibody Clarified Harvest To 30mg antibody /mL Matrix To 30mg antibody /mL Matrix To 30mg antibody /mL Matrix To 30mg antibody /mL Matrix Re equilibration 20mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 10 5 5 5 Run 2 was a control run with one sodium caprylate wash and no second wash. However, the absence of a second wash resulted in a high sodium chloride concentration in the leading edge of the elution peak. The anti-IL-18 antibody used in this experiment (NCIMB Accession No. 41786) is known to phase separate at high salt concentrations and did so in this eluate. Run 2 was therefore discarded and not analysed. The results from the runs 1,3 and 4 are also shown in Table 21. Table 21: Results Run # Recovery (%) HCP (ng/mg) 1 97.25 680.2 3 89.79 18.5 4 100 152.6 The results indicate that caprylic acid was capable of clearing HOP, but not to the same extent as sodium caprylate at the levels tested. In both cases, HOP levels were significantly reduced when compared to the control. In the control eluate, the level of HOP was 680ng/mL, which was reduced 4 fold to 152ng/mg in the caprylic acid experiment, and 35 fold in the sodium caprylate experiment. It is possible that increasing the concentration of the caprylic acid wash may further reduce the HOP in the eluate. The results demonstrate that both caprylic acid and sodium caprylate are capable of reducing HOP levels in Protein A eluates. Example 5: Reduction of Host Cell Protease Induced Particle Formation The purpose of this experiment was to investigate delayed-onset particle formation for an anti-IL6 antibody. Delayed onset particle formation was observed for in a formulation containing 50 mg/mL anti-IL6 antibody after 6 months at 5°C. The bioburden was 0 cfu/mL, indicating no bacterial contamination. A Mass Spec analysis of the particles revealed that the particles contained anti-IL6 antibody and elevated levels of fragments. No heavy elements were detected by SEM. No HOP was detected by 2D SDS PAGE (Figure 24). HOP levels in the eluate from Protein A purification was greater than 100 ng/mg when using a wash buffer that included 20 mM Tris, 1 Μ NaCI at pH 7.5 (“standard wash buffer”). Inclusion of a caprylate wash containing 100 mM Tris; 50 mM sodium caprylate, 2.5 Μ NaCI, pH 9.0 during Protein A purification reduced HOP levels from more than 100 ng/ml to less than 10 ng/ml. The purity of anti-IL6 antibody was measured by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) using aTSK-GEL G3000SWXL column (Tosoh Bioscience LLC, Mongomeryville, PA, USA) with UV detection at 280 nm. About 250 pg of protein was injected onto the assay column. Elution of soluble aggregates, monomer, and fragments occurred at approximately 6 to 8 min, 8.5 min, and 9 to11.5 min respectively. A flow rate of 1.0 mL/min for 20 minutes using a pH 6.8 mobile phase containing 0.1 Μ sodium phosphate, 0.1 Μ sodium sulfate, and 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide was used to assay the samples. SEC detected a higher fragmentation rate at 40°C fa anti-IL6 antibody lots with highest HCP levels (i.e., greater than about 100 ng/mg) (Figures 25 and 26). Anti-IL6 antibody samples were diluted to about 1 mg/mL in 1 mM pH 7.0 phosphate buffer and a 10 pL injection volumes were analyzed via reversed phase chromatography (RP-HPLC) for fragmentation. To perform the analyses a Michrom Bioresources (Auburn, CA, USA) PLRP-S CM810092/00 column with a gradient elution at 75°C using 0.1% TFA in water (mobile phase A, mp A) and 0.1% TFA (mp Β) in acetonitrile was used. Species were eluted using a gradient of mp Β (3 min hold at 5%, 5-34% over 3 min, 34-44% over 16 min, 44-75% over 2.5 min, followed by column conditioning at 95% for 8 min). When analyzed using RP-HPLC at 40°C the fragmentatbn rates were above about 3% per month for lots with highest HCP levels (i.e., greater than about 100 ng/mg) whereas lots that were purified with the caprylate wash step, with much lower HCP levels and without detectable protease activity, had fragmentation rates that were much lower at about 2 to 2.5% per month. All lots with HOP levels greater than 100 ng/mg formed delayed-onset visible particles based on visual inspection (Table 24).

All the lots with protease activity formed delayed onset particles. In contrast, the lots purified with caprylate wash (open symbols) did not demonstrate protease activity (See Figure 27) and did not form delayed onset particles (Table 25).

As shown in Table 26, lot D, which underwent a standard wash during Protein A purification and showed high HOP levels and detectable protease activity demonstrated significant particle formation at 3-12 months. In contrast, lot Ε, which was purified from the same cell culture media as lot D and had a significantly lower HOP level and no protease activity, showed very little particle formation over time. Thus, it appears that reducing HCP/protease levels with a caprylate wash during Protein A purification mitigates HOP protease-induced delayed-onset particle formation. It is believed that the best predictor of delayed onset particle formation is elevated HOP levels and protease activity. Apartyl and serine protease activity were examined in particle forming Lot Β using Invitrogen EnzChek® Protease Assay Kit for microplate HTS format. The results are shown in Figure 28. Pepstatin (inhibitor of aspartyl proteases) dramatically reduced protease activity. AEBSF (serine protease inhibitor) had a smaller impact at higher pH (other serine inhibitors also had an impact). Other classes of inhibitors did not reduce protease activity (not shown) Table 26: Stability Lot Purification Process HCP level (ngmg) Protease activity SEC purity loss rate at 40°C (°o. mol) RP Frag.

Samples were analyzed from the cell culture media and then in the Protein A in-process product for both the standard and caprylate wash and in the wash fractions from the protein A step for both the standard and caprylate process. A fluorescent protease assay (Invitrogen EnzChek® Protease Assay Kit) was used along with various commercially available protease inhibitors to detect and diagnose the presence and class/types of proteases present in the final drug substance and any intermediate purification samples. The EnzChek® Protease Assay Kit (Ε6638, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to assess protease activity in samples. The detection substrate in the kit is BODIPY®-casein conjugate. Samples were diluted 10-fold into 20 mM citrate-phosphate buffer at pHs typically ranging from 4 to 8. Matching placebos were prepared. The citrate-phosphate buffer was prepared by mixing 20 mM citric acid and 20 mM dibasic sodium phosphate to achieve the desired pHs. The preparation of reagents was adapted from the supplied procedure. The BODIPY®-casein conjugate detection substrate was diluted in the appropriate buffer to generate a working reagent at each pH from 4 to 8 at about 10 pg/mL. An equal (typically 100 pL) volume of sample and working reagent were added to wells in a white microplate to generate triplicate assay samples and matching placebos over the pH range 4 to 8. The samples were sealed and incubated at 40 °C for a typical duration of 3 to 5 hours. The dye fluorescence was excited at 485 nm and the emission intensity at 530 nm recorded using a 495 nm cutoff filter on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax® fluorescent plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA). The intensity vs. pH for the samples was recorded. Intensity increases of the sample compared to the blank of less than about 20% were dispositioned as negative for protease activity per the manufacturer guidelines based on variability in the method. Results for samples were buffer-subtracted and plotted vs. pH and used to determine the presence of protease activity in samples. Multiple replicates were run to assess the variability for low readings. For relative quantification, control preparations of known proteases such as Cathepsin-D or Trypsin as comparators were used. To confirm the presence of proteases, protease inhibitors were added to samples resulting in a relative decrease, or elimination, of the detected protease activity as a confirmation of the results. Two dimensional mass spectrometry (2D-MS) was used to identify serine protease and aspartyl protease (cathepsin-D) in the cell culture media and in the various protein A product and wash steps. Two hundred and sixty-four HCPs were identified in the cell culture media, including proteases. Using a standard wash, 24 HCPs were observed in the protein A product In contrast, using a caprylate wash, only 8 HCPs were noted in the protein A product. The results clearly demonstrate that HCP reduction was achieved by caprylate treatment. Because of the very low levels of proteases in the final drug substance, affinity purification and enrichment and concentration of the aspartyl protease (using Immobilized pepstatin, 786-789, G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) was needed to generate a sample with high enough protease levels to enable positive identification of the presence of cathepsin-D using mass spectrometry. Affinity purification was used to identify the proteases in the final drug substance. Immobilized pepstatin (786-789, G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) was used to capture, enrich and elute aspartyl proteases from the drug substance.
