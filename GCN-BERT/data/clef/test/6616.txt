A REFERENCING APPARATUS AND ASSOCIATED METHODS Field of Die Invention The present invention relates to surgical implements and surgical methods and in particular to a referencing apparatus' that may be applied to a patient prior to, or during, surgical procedures, for example surgery involving prosthetic components. Background The discussion of the prior art within this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an admission of the extent of common general knowledge in the field of the invention. Rather, the discussion of the prior art is provided merely to assist the addressee to understand the invention and is included without prejudice. Whilst tlie following discussion is with respect to hip replacement surgery, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention is not limited to this particular field of use and may be adapted to use with any bone structure or various types of surgery. Ηΐρ replacement surgery involves the use of a prosthetic cup (acetabular cup) or a prosthetic ball (femoral stems) or both to restore the ball and cup joint functionality of the hip. The hall and cup joint enables the hip to rotate in different directions to various degrees (in contrast to the relatively limited rotation of a knee joint). Historically, hip replacement (arthroplasty) surgery required up to a 40cm (7 to 12 inches) curved incision to provide sufficient access for the surgeon to manually access and manipulate the hip and femur. A prosthetic cup was attached to the hip socket or the head of the femur remo v ed and replaced with a prosthetic hall , or both. After the incision is made, the ligaments and muscles are separated to allow the surgeon access to the bones of the hip joint, ft is typically this part of fire surgery that makes the ligaments and muscles somewhat weak after surgery. Until they heal, which often takes about a month to six weeks, the patient must follow special hip precautions to prevent dislocation of the new hip joint, Typical steps in. hip replacement surgery include the following; - Removing the Femoral Head: Once the hip joint is entered, the femoral head is dislocated from the acetabulum. Then the femoral head is removed by cutting through the femoral neck with a power saw. - Reaming the Acetabulum: After the femoral head is removed, the cartilage is removed from the acetabulum using a power drill and a special reamer. The reamer forms the bone in a hemispherical shape to exactly fit the metal shell of the acetabular component. - Inserting the Acetabular Component: A trial component, which is an exact duplicate of the patient's hip prosthesis, is used to ensure that the joint received will be the right size and fi t. Once the right size and shape is determined for the acetabulum, the acetabular component is inserted, into place, hi the uncemented variety of artificial hip replacement, the metal shell is simply held in place by the tightness of the fit or with screws to hold the metal shell in place. In the cemented variety, a special epoxy type cement is used to “glue” the acetabular component to the bone. - Preparing the Femoral Canal: To begin replacing the femoral head, special rasps are used to shape and hollow out the femur to the exact shape of the metal stein of the femoral compon ent . Once again, a tri al component is used to ensure the correct size and shape. The surgeon will also test the movement of the hip jo int. - Inserting (he Femoral Stem: Once the size and shape of the canal exactly fit the femoral component, the stem is inserted into the femora! canal. Again, in the uncemented variety of femoral component the stem is held in place by the tightness of the fit into the bone (similar to tire friction that holds a nail driven into a hole drilled into wooden board - with a slightly smaller diameter than the nail). In the cemented variety, the femoral canal is rasped to a size slightly larger than the femoral stem. Then the epoxy type cement is used to bond the metal stem to the bone. - Attaching, (he Femoral Head: The metal ball that replaces the femoral head is attached to the femoral stem. - The Completed Hip Replacement; Before the incision is closed, an x-ray is taken to make sure the new prosthesis is in the correct position. S uch surgery had a number of problems including: * a hospital stay of three days or more, post-operative pain and weeks of rehabilitation; * each cm of incision has a tenfold increase in the risks of blood clotting and infection post surgery; * the surgeon was reliant on his experience and eye to ensure accurate placement of the cup into the three dimensional hip socket and alignment of the cup with the bail/femur to enable proper function of the joint. Misalignment may lead to post operative complication such as misalignment of the leg, incorrect leg length and/or incorrect soft tissue tension. The long term effects of misaligned prosthetic components can also include accelerated wear of the components,, aseptic loosening of the components and potentially early repetition of the surgery. Attempts to overcome these problems include: ■ WO 2003/037192 which discloses a jib (impaction tool) for use in bone surgery and thus enables the use of a smaller incision. For hip replacement surgery, the jig enables the use of a 4 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inch) incision, i.e. keyhole surgery. Other benefits include a shorter stay in hospital, less blood loss, less pain, fewer postoperative dislocations and faster recovery; and ■ WO 2005/046475 which discloses a gauge to assist the surgeon with accurate placement of a prosthetic when using a jig in keyhole surgery as the surgeon is no longer able to see the fit of the cup into the hip socket or the fit between the ball and cup. The gauge provided in WO 2005/046475 has enabled efficient use of the impaction tool of WO 2003/037192. Commercial examples include the NilNav Hip System available from .MAC Surgical. However, the gauge only works in two dimensions and there is still a heavy reliance on the surgeon’s eye and experience for optimal placement of the cup into the hip, A further attempt to overcome these problems was provided by WO 2010/031111, the contents of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety into this specification by way of cross reference. This prior art document discloses a brace (3) in the form of a clamp that is attachable to a patient to define a reference point relative to the patient’s anatomy. This prior art clamp has a number of pads (14, 16. 1? and 18) that are positioned against various points of the patent’s anatomy. However, it has been appreciated by the present inventor that this clamp is likely to be obstructive to at least some surgical procedures and does not readily accommodate the surgical drapes that are typically used in many surgical settings.

Brief Description of the Drawings Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a top side perspective view of an embodiment of the referencing apparatus according to the invention; Figure 2 is a left hand side perspective view of the embodiment of Figure 1 ; Figure 3 is a underside perspective view of an embodiment of an electronic orientation monitor for use with the brace of Figure 1 ; Figure 4 is another underside perspective view of the embodiment of Figure 3: Figure 5 is a detail partial perspective view of the docking station of the embodiment of Figure 1; Figure 6 is a detail partial perspective view of the electronic orientation monitor of Figure 3 as attached to the docking station of the brace of Figure 1; Figure 7 is a top side perspective view of the electronic orientation monitor of Figure 3 as attached to the docking station of the brace of Figure 1; and Figure 8 is a side perspective view of the electronic orientation monitor of Figure 3 as attached to the docking station of the brace of Figure Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments Referring to the drawings, foe referencing apparatus 1 is for application onto a patient at least partially covered by surgical drapes. Typically the patient lies on the surgical table in a face up position (le. the patient lies on his or her back). The surgical drapes are positioned on foe patient prior to the surgery so as to cover the general region of the patient that is proposed to be operated upon, with an aperture in the drapes being positioned over foe proposed site of the surgical incision. In some instances a surgeon may decide against the use of surgical drapes, in which case alternatives, such as cling film for example, may be used instead. The scope of the term “drapes” as used in this patent specification, including in the claims, is to be construed sufficiently broadly so as to include such alternatives This detailed description shall describe the use of the referencing apparatus 1 as an aid in foe insertion of a prosthetic component in the form of an acetabular cup, into a reamed acetabulum of a patient’s pelvis wherein an anterior approach is used for surgical access to the patent’s acetabulum. An important part of this process is the use of the referencing apparatus 1 to calibrate an electronic orientation monitor, which may be as per that disclosed in WO2010/031 111, foe contents of which have been incorporated in their entirety into, this specification by way of cross reference. However Η will he appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be used in other surgical contexts. The referencing apparatus 1 has a ‘T*-shaped frame 8 with a docking station 9 disposed at the intersection of the ‘T’ shape. The frame 8 defines two slots 10 and 1 i disposed adjacent two of the extremities of the ‘T’ shape. Each of the slots 10 and 11 has a length of between 60 mm and .120 mm and in one embodiment each of their length s is 70mm and in another embodiment each of their lengths is 100mm, The referencing apparatus I has three locating elements, which are each in tile shape of circular loops 2, 3 and 4, Each of the loops 2, 3 and 4 has a diameter of between 30 ram and 70 mm and in the illustrated embodiment this diameter is 50 nun. As will be described in more detail below, each of these loops 2, 3 and 4 is sized to receive a projection of the surgical drapes caused by engagement with an anatomical site. The first and third loops 2 and 4 are each attached to respective distal ends of arcuate members 5 and 6. The radius of curvature of each of the arcuate members 5 and 6 is between 40 mm and 80 mm and is 60mm in the illustrated embodiment. The curvature of members 5 and 6 provides clearan ce for situations in which fee referencing apparatus I. is to be used on an overweight or obese patient having Stomach fat deposits that would foul against the members 5 and 6 if they were straight. The proximal end of arcuate member 5 is attachable to the frame 8 at slot 10. The proximal end of arcuate member 6 is attachable to the frame 8 at fee extremity of the £T? shaped frame 8 that does not have a slot 10 or Tl . Rather, an aperture is disposed adjacent this extremity, through which fee proximal end of arcuate member 6 extends. Screw threads extending to flanges 14 and 15 are respectively provided on the proximal ends of the arcuate members 5 and 6. Screwing threaded fasteners 12 and 13 respectively onto the proximal ends of arcuate members 5 and 6 causes flanges 14 and 15 to engage against fee lower side of the frame 8 so as to provide a clamping action that attaches the arcuate members 5 and 6 onto the frame 8. If the user wishes to adjust the position of fee first loop 2 relative to the frame Β, it is merely necessary to loosen the threaded fastener 12, then slide the proximal end of arcuate member 5 along slot 10 until fee loop 2 is in the desired position, ami then retighten the threaded fastener 12. This adjustability of the attachment position of fee arcuate member 5 on the frame 8 allows the separation distance between loops 2 and 4 to be adjusted to match the separation distance between the patient’s, left anterior superior iliac spine and the patient’s right anterior superior iliac spine. It will be appreciated that loosening of threaded fastener 1:2 also allows for rotation of arcuate member 5 about an axis of rotation that is orthogonal to the upper surface of the frame 8. Hence, if the user wishes to adjust the position of the clearance provided by the curvature of arcuate member 5, then the user merely loosens threaded fastener 12, rotates arcuate member 5 until the curvature is in the desired position and then retightens threaded fastener 12, Doing so does not re-position the loop 2 relative to the frame 8 because the centre of loop 2 is in axial alignment with the axi s of rotation of the arcuate member 5. Similarly, it is possible to adjust the position of the clearance provided by the curvature of arcuate member 6 by loosening threaded member 13, rotating arcuate member 6, then re-tightening threaded member 13, This does not reposition loop 4 because its centre is in axial alignment with the axis of rotation of the arcuate member 6, The second loop 3 is attached to the distal end of a linear elongate member 7. The proximal end of member 7 is attachable to the frame 8 at slot 11. A screw thread extending to a flange 16 is provided on the proximal end of member 7. This allows a threaded fastener 17 to be screwed onto the proximal end of member? to thereby cause flange 36 to engage against the lower side of the frame 8 so as to damp the member 7 onto the frame 8. The position of the second loop 3 can be adjusted by loosening threaded fastener 17, then sliding the proximal end of member 7 along slot 11 unti l loop 3 is in the desired position and then re-tightening threaded fastener 17. In other words, die adjustability given by slots 10 and 11 allows the referencing apparatus 1 to be used on patient’s having variously sized pel.vises. The shape of each of the loops 2, 3 and 4 allows for engagement with the surgical drapes such that the surgical drapes are disposed intermediate the three loops and three respective predefined anatomical sites on the patient. In use, the surgeon and/or an assistant uses their fingers to apply pressure to the surgical drapes to feel for the approximate positions of the predefined anatomical sites, which are the patient ’s left and right anterior superior iliac spine and the patient’s pubic crest. It has been appreciated by the inventor that these anatomical sites may be readily discerned through the surgical drapes in this manner. Once these approximate positions are known the first loop 2 is positioned on the surgical drapes centred above the patient’s right hand anterior superior iliac Spine. The second loop 3 is positioned on the surgical drapes centred above the patient’s pubic crest and the third loop 4 is positioned on the surgical drapes centred above the patient’s left hand anterior superior iliac spine. Once the referencing apparatus 1 is positioned as described in the preceding paragraph, the surgeon and/or an assistant presses the referencing apparatus f into engagement with the surgical drapes. The anatomical sites have bony projections that become more prominent when the loops 2, and 3 and 4 are pressed against them, This causes the surgical drapes at those sites to project into the cavities defined by the interior of each of the loops 2, 3 and 4. This engagement causes the docking station 9 to assume a reference orientation relative to the three predefined anatomical sites. As best shown in Figure 3, the electronic orientation monitor 18 has a shaft 19 disposed on its underside 20 such that the shaft 19 extends from the underside 20 at an angle that is matched to a desired anteversion of the acetabular cup. In the illustrated embodiment this angle is 15°, although this may vary depending upon die patient’s anatomy, the surgeon’s preferences and/or upon the type of prosthetic acetabular cup that is to be used. If another anteversion angle is desired, then a different shaft having the desired angle may be affixed to the electronic orientation monitor 18. The shaft 19 is sized so as to mate with one of two possible holes 21 or 22 provided within the docking station 9. The shape and geometry of each hole 21 and 22 is such that each of them presents only one option for entry of the shaft 19. The orientations of the holes 21 and 22 are selected such that the holes correspond to the orientation of the shaft of a prosthetic insertion implement that is to be used during the subsequent insertion steps that are described in more detail below. The angles at which the first and second holes 21 and 22 are drilled into the docking station 9 are selected as to match a desired inclination of tire acetabular cup.. In the illustrated embodiment this angle is 40°, although this may vary depending upon the patient’s anatomy, the surgeon’s preferences and/or upon the type of prosthetic acetabular cup that is to be used. Mating tire shaft with the first hole 21 provides a first docking configuration, as shown for example in Figure 7. in tire first docking configuration the orientation of the electronic orientation monitor 18 relative to the frame 8 is such dial when the docking station 9 is in the reference orientation, the electronic orientation monitor 18 may be calibrated to a reference orientation that is suitable for insertion of an. acetabular cup into the patient’s left hand, side acetabulum. Mating the shaft with the second hole 22 provides a second docking configuration, as shown for example in Figure 6. In the second docking configuration the orientation of the electronic orientation monitor 18 relative to the frame 8 is such that when the docking station 9 is in the reference orientation, the electronic orientation monitor 18 may be calibrated to a reference orientation that is suitable for insertion of an acetabular cup into the patient’s right hand side acetabulum. The shaft 19 includes a pin 23, which functions as a stop when the shaft 19 is folly inserted into either the first hole 21 or the second hole 22. Additionally, the shaft 19 includes two ball bearing detents 24 and 25, which releasabty retain the shaft 19 within the selected first or second hole 21 or 22 once it has been fully inserted. As mentioned above, pushing the referencing apparatus 1 into engagement with the drapes on the patient causes the docking station 9 to assume the reference orientation relative to the patient's pelvis and hence the docked electronic orientation monitor 18 is in a reference orientation. Whilst in this state the user presses the calibration button 26, which prompts the electronic orientation monitor 18 to sense its current orientation. Data indicative of this reference orientation is stored within the memory of the electronic orientation monitor 18, which has now been calibrated and may be detached from the referencing apparatus 1. Additionally, the referencing apparatus 1 is now removed from the patient, The electronic orientation monitor 18 Is now attached to an insertion implement having either a trial acetabular cup, or the definitive acetabular cup. One such implement is disclosed in WO 2010/031 1 1 1, however it will be appreciated that any suitable implement may be used. The surgeon manipulates the insertion implement into a position whereby the cup is adjacent the acetabulum and a display 27 on the electronic orientation monitor 18 guides the surgeon to orient the insertion implement such that the current orientation of the electronic orientation monitor 18 is equal to the reference orientation (or such that the current orientation has some other desired relationship to the reference orientation). Once the desired orientation has been achieved, the electronic orientation monitor 18 provides an indication to the surgeon, such as a visual indication on the display and/or an audible indication, and this prompts the surgeon to either assess the trial cup, or to impact the definitive cup into the patient's teamed acetabulum. From the foregoing description it will he appreciated that the referencing apparatus 1 is configured for solely anterior engagement with the drapes that are on the patient during the steps of pressing the referencing apparatus into engagement with the surgical drapes and during calibration of the electronic orientation monitor. This compares favourably with the clamp disclosed in WO 2010/031111, which requires both anterior and posterior engagement with the patient. This is because it has been appreciated by the present inventor that in practice the clamp of WO 2010/03 Ml i may cause an undesirable obstruction to the surgeon. Whilst die invention has been described with reference to specific examples, those skilled in the art will appreciate that it may be embodied in many other forms. 1.
