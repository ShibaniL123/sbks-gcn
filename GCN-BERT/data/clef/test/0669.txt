TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to improvements in the field of processes for treating industrial waste materials. For example, it relates to processes for treating red mud. For example, these processes can be effective for extracting various materials from red mud such as alumina and various metals and oxides thereof, silica, rare earth elements, rare metals etc. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE Red mud is a solid waste product generated during a process for the production of alumina. For example, red mud is produced during the Bayer process for alumina production, the principal industrial means of refining bauxite in order to provide alumina as raw material for the electrolysis of aluminum by the Hall-HÃ©roult process. A typical plant produces one to two times as much red mud as alumina. This ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite or ore used in the refining process. Generally, red mud comprises mixture of solid and metallic oxide-bearing impurities, and presents one of the aluminum industry's most important disposal problems. The red colour can be caused, for example, by the oxidised iron present therein. Red mud cannot be disposed of easily. In most countries where red mud is produced, it is pumped into holding ponds. Red mud is thus a problem since it takes up land area and can neither be built on nor farmed, even when dry. Red mud is, for example, highly basic. For example, the pH can be ranging from 10 to 13. Several methods have been developed to lower the alkaline pH to an acceptable level to decrease the impact on the environment. Several researches have been done to find a suitable way to utilize the mud for other applications, but drying the mud requires much energy (latent heat for water evaporation) and can represent high costs if fossil fuels have to be used in the drying process. The quantities of red mud worldwide continue to grow. In 2010 alone, 80 million tonnes of alumina were produced throughout the world, creating over 120 million tonnes of red mud. It is estimated that red mud inventory in the world has actually reached well over 2.5 billion tonnes. This figure will only continue to grow as increasing demand for aluminium drives the demand of alumina, and in turn for bauxite, which means increased production of toxic red mud residues. There is thus a need for an alternative process for treating red mud.

Leaching can also be carried out by adding dry highly concentrated acid (for example, 85%, 90% or 95%) in gas phase into the aqueous solution. Alternatively, leaching can also be carried out by using a weak acid solution (for example <3 wt %). For example, leaching can be carried out by using HCl having a concentration of about 18 to about 32 wt % in a first reactor and then, by using HCl having concentration of about 90 to about 95% (gaseous) in a second reactor. For example, leaching can be carried out by using HCl having a concentration of about 18 to about 32 wt % in a first reactor then, by using HCl having concentration of about 90 to about 95% (gaseous) in a second reactor; and by using HCl having concentration of about 90 to about 95% (gaseous) in a third reactor. For example, leaching can be carried out under an inert gas atmosphere (for example argon or nitrogen). For example, leaching can be carried out under an atmosphere of NH3. For example, the material can be leached at a temperature of about 125 to about 225Â° C., about 140 to about 165Â° C., about 145 to about 160Â° C., about 150 to about 200Â° C., about 150 to about 190Â° C., about 160 to about 190Â° C., about 185 to about 190Â° C., about 160 to about 180Â° C., about 160 to about 175Â° C., or about 165 to about 170Â° C. For example, the material can be leached at a pressure of about 4 to about 10 barg, about 4 to about 8 barg, or about 5 to about 6 barg. For example, the material can be leached at a pressure of about 50 to about 150 psig, about 60 to about 100 psig, or about 70 to about 80 psig. For example, the material can be leached with HCl having a concentration of about 10 to about 50 weight %, about 15 to about 45 weight %, of about 18 to about 45 weight % of about 18 to about 32 weight %, of about 20 to about 45 weight %, of about 25 to about 45 weight %, of about 26 to about 42 weight %, of about 28 to about 40 weight %, of about 30 to about 38 weight %, or between 25 and 36 weight %. For example, HCl at about 18 wt % or about 32 wt % can be used. Leaching can also be carried out by adding dry highly concentrated acid (for example, 85%, 90% or 95%) in gas phase into the aqueous solution. Alternatively, leaching can also be carried out by using a weak acid solution (for example <3 wt %). For example, leaching can be carried out by using HCl having a concentration of about 18 to about 32 wt % in a first reactor and then, by using HCl having concentration of about 90 to about 95%, or about 95 to about 100% (gaseous) in a second reactor. For example, leaching can be carried out by using HCl having a concentration of about 18 to about 32 wt % in a first reactor then, by using HCl having concentration of about 90 to about 95% (gaseous) in a second reactor; and by using HCl having concentration of about 90 to about 95% (gaseous) in a third reactor. For example, leaching can be carried out under an inert gas atmosphere (for example argon or nitrogen). For example, leaching can be carried out under an atmosphere of NH3. For example a first leaching can be carried out at atmospheric pressure and then, at least one further leaching (for example 1, 2 or 3 subsequent leaching steps) can be carried out under pressure. For example, the processes can further comprise, before leaching the red mud, a pre-leaching removal of fluorine optionally contained in the red mud. Before leaching, the material can be, for example, treated through a ball mill. For example, ted mud can be to be reduced to 80, 85 or 90% passing a 63 micron sieve. For example, leaching can be a continuous leaching or semi-continuous. For example, the processes of the present disclosure can be continuous or semi-continuous. For example, the processes can further comprise recycling the gaseous HCl so-produced by contacting it with water so as to obtain a composition having a concentration of about 18 to about 45 weight %, about 26 to about 42 weight %, about 25 to about 45 weight %, about 28 to about 40 weight %, about 30 to about 38 weight %, about 18 to about 36%, or %. For example, the processes can further comprise recycling the gaseous HCl so-produced by contacting it with water so as to obtain a composition having a concentration of about 18 to about 45 weight % or about 25 to about 45 weight % and using the composition for leaching the material. For example, the liquid can comprise iron chloride. Iron chloride can comprise at least one of FeCl2, FeCl3, and a mixture thereof. For example, the liquid can have an iron chloride concentration of at least 30% by weight; and can then be hydrolyzed at a temperature of about 155 to about 350Â° C. For example, the liquid can be concentrated to a concentrated liquid having an iron chloride concentration of at least 30% by weight; and then the iron chloride can be hydrolyzed at a temperature of about 155 to about 350Â° C. while maintaining a ferric chloride concentration at a level of at least 65% by weight, to generate a composition comprising a liquid and precipitated hematite, and recovering the hematite. For example, non-hydrolysable elements with hematite can be concentrated back to a concentration of about 0.125 to about 52% wt. in circulation loop in view of selective extraction. For example, the liquid can be concentrated to a concentrated liquid having a concentration of the at least one iron chloride of at least 30% by weight; and then hydrolyzed at a temperature of about 155 to about 350Â° C. For example, the liquid can be concentrated to a concentrated liquid having a concentration of the at least one iron chloride of at least 30% by weight; and then the at least one iron chloride is hydrolyzed at a temperature of about 155 to about 350Â° C. while maintaining a ferric chloride concentration at a level of at least 65% by weight, to generate a composition comprising a liquid and precipitated hematite, and recovering the hematite. For example, the liquid can be concentrated to a concentrated liquid having a concentration of the at least one iron chloride of at least 30% by weight; and then the at least one iron chloride is hydrolyzed at a temperature of about 155 to about 350Â° C. while maintaining a ferric chloride concentration at a level of at least 65% by weight, to generate a composition comprising a liquid and precipitated hematite; recovering the hematite; and recovering rare earth elements and/or rare metals from the liquid. For example, the at least one iron chloride can be hydrolyzed at a temperature of about, 150 to about 175, 155 to about 170 or 165 to about 170Â° C. For example, the liquid can be concentrated to a concentrated liquid having an iron chloride concentration of at least 30% by weight; and then the iron chloride can be hydrolyzed at a temperature of about 155 to about 350Â° C. while maintaining a ferric chloride concentration at a level of at least 65% by weight, to generate a composition comprising a liquid and precipitated hematite; recovering the hematite; and recovering rare earth elements and/or rare metals from the liquid. For example, the processes can further comprise, after recovery of the rare earth elements and/or rare metals, reacting the liquid with HCl so as to cause precipitation of MgCl2, and recovering same. For example, the processes can further comprise calcining MgCl2 into MgO. For example, the processes can further comprise calcining MgCl2 into MgO and recycling the gaseous HCl so-produced by contacting it with water so as to obtain a composition having a concentration of about 25 to about 45 weight % or about 18 to about 45 weight % and using the composition for leaching the red mud. For example, the processes can further comprises, after recovery of the rare earth elements and/or rare metals, reacting the liquid with HCl, and substantially selectively precipitating Na2SO4. For example, Na2SO4 can be precipitated by reacting the liquid with H2SO4. For example, the processes can further comprises, after recovery of the rare earth elements and/or rare metals, reacting the liquid with HCl, and substantially selectively precipitating K2SO4. For example, K2SO4 can be precipitated by adding H2SO4. For example, the liquid can be concentrated to a concentrated liquid having an iron chloride concentration of at least 30% by weight; and then the iron chloride can be hydrolyzed at a temperature of about 155 to about 350Â° C. while maintaining a ferric chloride concentration at a level of at least 65% by weight, to generate a composition comprising a liquid and precipitated hematite; recovering the hematite; and reacting the liquid with HCl. For example, such processes can further comprises reacting the liquid with H2SO4 so as to substantially selectively precipitate Na2SO4. The processes can also comprise further reacting the liquid with H2SO4 so as to substantially selectively precipitating K2SO4. For example, the processes can comprise reacting dry individual salts (for example Na or K salts) obtained during the processes with H2SO4 and recovering HCl while producing marketable K2SO4 and Na2SO4 and recovering hydrochloric acid of about 15 to about 90% wt. For example, sodium chloride produced in the processes can undergo a chemical reaction with sulfuric acid so as to obtain sodium sulfate and regenerate hydrochloric acid. Potassium chloride can undergo a chemical reaction with sulfuric acid so as to obtain potassium sulfate and regenerate hydrochloric acid. Sodium and potassium chloride brine solution can alternatively be the feed material to adapted small chlor-alkali electrolysis cells. In this latter case, common bases (NaOH and KOH) and bleach (NaOCl and KOCl) are produced. For example, the processes can further comprise, after recovery of the rare earth elements and/or rare metals, recovering NaCl from the liquid, reacting the NaCl with H2SO4, and substantially selectively precipitating Na2SO4. For example, the processes can further comprise, downstream of recovery of the rare earth elements and/or rare metals, recovering KCl from the liquid, reacting the KCl with H2SO4, and substantially selectively precipitating K2SO4.

For example, the crystallization can be carried out at a temperature of about 45 to about 65Â° C. or about 50 to about 60Â° C. For example, crystallization of AlCl3.6H2O can be carried out by adding concentrated gaseous HCl to reach a proprietary concentration established of free HCl in the crystalliser. The average results obtained from the crystals For example, the hexahydrate crystals can be fed to the calcination unit. AlCl3 hydrolysis and conversion can occur at very low temperature (<200Â° C.). The crystals can pass through a first step where decomposition occurs followed by the calcination itself. The circulating fluid bed can be operated such that energy consumption is less than 30% of the energy normally required for hexahydrate crystal calcination. The alumina produced can be washed to remove unconverted salt if required. For example, the HCl can be obtained from the gaseous HCl so-produced. For example, in the processes of the present disclosure, a given batch or quantity of the aluminum-containing material will be leached, will then be converted into AlCl3 and when the HCl generated during calcination of AlCl3 into Al2O3 will be used for example to leach another given batch or quantity of the aluminum-containing material. For example, the processes can comprise heating the precipitate at a temperature of at least 180, 230, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 925, 930, 1000, 1100, 1200 or 1250Â° C. for converting AlCl3 into Al2O3. For example, converting AlCl3 into Al2O3 can comprise calcination of AlCl3. For example, calcination is effective for converting AlCl3 into beta-Al2O3. For example, calcination is effective for converting AlCl3 into alpha-Al2O3.

For example, the process can comprise converting AlCl3.6H2O into Al2O3 by carrying out a calcination of AlCl3.6H2O, the calcination comprising steam injection. For example, steam (or water vapor) can be injected at a pressure of about 200 to about 700 psig, about 300 to about 700 psig, about 400 to about 700 psig, about 550 to about 650 psig, about 575 to about 625 psig, or about 590 to about 610 psig. For example, steam (or water vapor) can be injected and a plasma torch can be used for carrying fluidization. For example, the steam (or water vapor) can be overheated. For example, the steam (or water vapor) can be at a temperature of about 300 to about 400Â° C. For example, acid from the offgases generated during calcination can be then treated via a gas phase purification process. For example, converting AlCl3 into Al2O3 can comprise carrying out a calcination by means of carbon monoxide (CO). For example, converting AlCl3 into Al2O3 can comprise carrying out a calcination by means of a Refinery Fuel Gas (RFG). For example, calcination can be carried out by injecting water vapor or steam and/or by using a combustion source chosen from fossil fuels, carbon monoxide, a Refinery Fuel Gas, coal, or chlorinated gases and/or solvants. For example, calcination can be carried out by injecting water vapor or steam and/or by using a combustion source chosen from natural gas or propane. For example, calcination can be carried out by providing heat by means of electric heating, gas heating, microwave heating. For example, the processes can comprise precipitating the Al3â² ions under the form of Al(OH)3. For example, precipitating the Al3â² under the form of Al(OH)3 is carried out at a pH of about 7 to about 10; about 9 to about 10; about 9.2 to about 9.8; about 9.3 to about 9.7; about 9.5; 7.5 to about 8.5; about 7.8 to about 8.2; or about 8.

The obtained alumina can be washed by demineralized water so as to at least partially remove NaCl and/or KCl. For example, the fluid bed reactor can comprise a metal catalyst chosen from metal chlorides. For example, the fluid bed reactor can comprise a metal catalyst that is FeCl3, FeCl2 or a mixture thereof. For example, the fluid bed reactor can comprise a metal catalyst that is FeCl3. For example, the preheating system can comprise a plasma torch. For example, steam can be used as the fluidization medium heating. Heating can also be electrical. For example, a plasma torch can be used for preheating the calcination reactor. For example, a plasma torch can be used for preheating air entering in the calcination reactor. For example, the plasma torch can be used for generating steam that is injected into a calcination reactor. For example, the plasma torch can be effective for generating steam that is as fluidization medium in a fluid bed reactor. For example, a plasma torch can be used for preheating a fluid bed. For example, the calcination medium can be substantially neutral in terms of O2 (or oxidation). For example, the calcination medium can favorize reduction (for example a concentration of CO of about 100 ppm). For example, the calcination medium is effective for preventing formation of Cl2. For example, the processes can comprise converting AlCl3.6H2O into Al2O3 by carrying out a calcination of AlCl3.6H2O, for example, that is provided by the combustion of gas mixture that comprises: CH4: 0 to about 1% vol; C2H6: 0 to about 2% vol; C3H8: 0 to about 2% vol; C4H10: 0 to about 1% vol; N2: 0 to about 0.5% vol; H2: about 0.25 to about 15.1% vol; CO: about 70 to about 82.5% vol; and CO2: about 1.0 to about 3.5% vol. Such a mixture can be efficient for reduction in off gas volume of 15.3 to 16.3%; therefore the capacity increases of 15.3 to 16.3% proven on practical operation of the circulating fluid bed. Thus for a same flow it represents an Opex of 0.65*16.3%=10.6%. For example, the air to natural gas ratio of (Nm3/h over Nm3/h) in the fluid bed can be about 9.5 to about 10 For example, the air to CO gas ratio of (Nm3/h over Nm3/h) in the fluid bed can be about 2 to about 3. For example, O2 can be substantially absent from the gas mixture. For example, the processes can comprise, before leaching the aluminum-containing material, a pre-leaching removal of optionally contained in the aluminum-containing material. For example, the processes can comprise leaching of the aluminum-containing material with HCl so as to obtain the leachate comprising aluminum ions and the solid, separating the solid from the leachate; and further treating the solid so as to separate SiO2 from TiO2 that are contained therein. For example, the processes can comprise leaching the aluminum-containing material with HCl so as to obtain the leachate comprising aluminum ions and the solid, separating the solid from the leachate; and further treating the solid so as to separate Si from Ti that are contained therein. For example, the processes can comprise leaching the aluminum-containing material with HCl so as to obtain the leachate comprising aluminum ions and the solid, separating the solid from the leachate; and further treating the solid with HCl so as to separate Si from Ti that are contained therein. For example, the process can comprise leaching the red mud with HCl so as to obtain the leachate comprising aluminum ions and the solid, separating the solid from the leachate; and further treating the solid with HCl, in the presence of a chloride (for example chosen from akali chlorides and alkaline earth chlorides), so as to separate Si from Ti that are contained therein. For example, the solid can be treated with HCl and the chloride so as to obtain a liquid portion comprising Ti and a solid portion containing Si and wherein the liquid portion is separated from the solid portion. For example, the solid can be treated with HCl and the chloride so as to obtain a liquid portion comprising TiCl4. For example, the process can further comprise converting TiCl4 into TiO2. For example, TiCl4 can be converted into TiO2 by solvent extraction of the third liquid fraction and subsequent formation of titanium dioxide from the solvent extraction. For example, TiCl4 can be reacted with water and/or a base to cause precipitation of TiO2. For example, TiCl4 can be converted into TiO2 by means of a pyrohydrolysis, thereby generating HCl. For example, TiCl4 can be converted into TiO2 by means of a pyrohydrolysis, thereby generating HCl that is recycled. For example, the solid can comprise TiO2 and SiO2 and the solid can be treated with Cl2 and carbon in order to obtain a liquid portion and a solid portion, and wherein the solid portion and the liquid portion are separated from one another. For example, the liquid portion can comprise TiCl2 and/or TiCl4. For example, the liquid portion can comprise TiCl4. For example, the process can further comprise heating TiCl4 so as to convert it into TiO2. For example, obtained TiO2 can be purified by means of a plasma torch. For example, the processes can comprise leaching the aluminum-containing material with HCl so as to obtain the leachate comprising aluminum ions and the solid, separating the solid from the leachate; and further treating the solid with HCl at a concentration of less than 20% wt., at a temperature of less than 85Â° C., in the presence of a chloride, so as to separate Si from Ti that are contained therein For example, the chloride can be chosen from akali chlorides and alkaline earth chlorides. For example, the chloride can be MgCl2 or CaCl2. After the leaching, the titanium ions under the form of titanium chloride are in a liquid phase and the Si remains solid. Therefore, SI can thus be simply separated from Ti by a solid/liquid separation. Then, titanium chloride can be converted into TiO2. It has to be noted that titanium oxychloride can also be present in the leachate. Various methods of recovering titanium from a leachate are discussed in CA 2,513,309, which is hereby integrated by reference in its entirety. For example, separation methods such as solvent extraction, precipitation or ion exchange can be used to remove impurities various impurities e. g. iron, chromium and vanadium, followed by recovery of titanium. Some of these techniques are discussed in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,396 (also integrated by reference in its entirety. For example, in order to purify titanium ions, the leachate can be treated with an organic phase. The organic phase can be selected so that ions of a given can be selectively extracted into the organic phase, with titanium ions remaining in the aqueous solution. Thus, oxides of this given metal can also be obtained in high purity. Examples of the organic phase are quaternary ammonium chlorides, amines (primary, secondary or tertiary), phosphoric and phosphinic acids, and esters and oxides thereof, e. g. tri-n-butyl phosphate, di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid and phosphine oxide. The organic phase may be stripped from the iron values and recycled. Such an organic phase can be selected so that the titanium chloride can be soluble in the organic phase. For example, the organic phase can be selected such that the organic phase and titanium chloride may be separated by fractional distillation (for example with a separation in boiling points between the organic phase and titanium chloride.) For example, the titanium chloride can be treated with water or a base, (for example magnesium oxide), or by raising the temperature of the solution to 85-110 C, to effect precipitation of titanium dioxide. The titanium chloride product obtained can also be subjected to calcination in a pyrohydrolysis reactor or be treated in a plasma torch so as to convert it into TiO2. For example, converting AlCl3 into Al2O3 can comprise carrying out a one-step calcination. For example, calcination can be carried out at different temperatures with steam. Temperature applied of superheated steam can be of about 350Â° C. to about 550Â° C. or about 350Â° C. to about 940Â° C. or about 350Â° C. to about 1200Â° C. For example, multi stage evaporation step of the hydrolyser can be carried out to reduce drastically energy consumption. For example, the processes can be effective for providing an Al2O3 recovery yield of at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, about 90 to about 95%, about 92 to about 95%, or about 93 to about 95%. For example, the processes can be effective for providing a Fe2O3 recovery yield of at least 98%, at least 99%, about 98 to about 99.5%, or about 98.5 to about 99.5%. For example, the processes can be effective for providing a MgO recovery yield of at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or about 96 to about 98%. For example, the processes can be effective for providing a HCl recovery yield of at least 98%, at least 99%, or about 98 to about 99.9%. For example, the processes can be effective for providing chlorides of rare earth elements (REE-Cl) and chlorides of rare metals (RM-Cl) in recovery yields of about 75% to about 96.5% by using internal processes via an internal concentration loop. For example, the processes can be effective for providing hydrochloric acid recovery yield of about 99.75% with non-hydrolysable elements. For example, the aluminum-containing material can be red mud. For example, the aluminum-containing material can be chosen from industrial refractory materials. For example, the aluminum-containing material chosen from aluminosilicate minerals. For example, the processes can be effective for avoiding producing red mud. For example, the obtained alumina and the other products are substantially free of red mud. For example, HCl can be recycled. For example, such a recycled HCl can be concentrated and/or purified. For example, the recovered HCl can gaseous HCl and can be treated with H2SO4 so as to reduce the amount of water present in the gaseous HCl. For example, the recovered HCl can be gaseous HCl and can be passed through a packed column so as to be in contact with a H2SO4 countercurrent flow so as to reduce the amount of water present in the gaseous HCl. For example, gaseous HCl can be concentrated and/or purified by means of H2SO4. For example, gaseous HCl can be passed through a packed column where it is contacted with a H2SO4 countercurrent flow. For example, by doing so, concentration of HCl can be increased by at least 50% wt., at least 60% wt., at least 70% wt., at least 75% wt., at least 80% wt., about 50% wt. to about 80% wt., about 55% wt. to about 75% wt., or about 60% wt. For example, the column can be packed with a polymer such as polypropylene (PP) or polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT). For example, gaseous HCl can be concentrated and/or purified by means of CaCl2 or LiCl. For example, gaseous HCl can be passed through a column packed with CaCl2 or LiCl. By doing, the amount of water can be reduced from HCl. For example, the concentration of gaseous HCl is increased from a value below the azeotropic point before treatment to a value above the azeotropic point after treatment. For example, once crystallized, the alkalis (mostly Na) can be processed so as to recovering highly concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). The process chosen for the conversion can generate value-added products commonly used in the chemical industry. For example, to produce bleaching agent from alkali, a sodium chloride brine solution can be fed to adapted small chlor-alkali electrolysis cells. It can be, for example, a two-step process in which the brine is submitted to high current and base (NaOH) is produced with chlorine (Cl2) and hydrogen (H2). H2 and Cl2 can then be submitted to a common flame where highly concentrated acid in gas phase is produced and can be used directly in the crystallization stages. For example, the various products obtained by the processes of the present disclosure such as alumina, hematite, titanium oxides, magnesium oxides, rare earth elements and rare metals, etc can be further purified by means of a plasma torch. For example, they can be individually injected into a plasma torch so as to further purify them. For example, the processes can further comprise converting alumina (Al2O3) into aluminum. Conversion of alumina into aluminum can be carried out, for example, by using the Hall-Heroult process. References is made to such a well known process in various patents and patent applications such as US 20100065435; US 20020056650; U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,584; U.S. Pat. No. 6,565,733. Conversion can also be carried out by means of other methods such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,867,373; U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,716; U.S. Pat. No. 6,565,733 (converting alumina into aluminum sulfide followed by the conversion of aluminum sulfide into aluminum). For example, aluminium can be produced by using a reduction environment and carbon at temperature below 200Â° C. Aluminum can also be produced by reduction using potassium and anhydrous aluminum chloride (Wohler Process). For example, wherein the conversion of Al2O3 into aluminum can be carried out by converting Al2O3 into Al2S3 and then converting Al2S3 into aluminum. For example, the process can comprise reacting the leachate with gaseous HCl so as to obtain a liquid and a precipitate comprising MgCl2. For example, the process comprises reacting the leachate with gaseous HCl so as to obtain a liquid and a precipitate comprising MgCl2. For example, NaCl recovered from the processes of the present disclosure can be reacted with SO2, so as to produce HCl and Na2SO4. Such a reaction that is an exothermic reaction can generate steam that can be used to activate a turbine and eventually produce electricity. For example, the solid can comprise TiO2 and SiO2 and the solid can be treated with Cl2 and carbon in order to obtain a liquid portion and a solid portion, and wherein the solid portion and the liquid portion are separated from one another. For example, the at least one metal can comprise a first metal that is chosen from aluminum, iron, zinc, copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, cobalt, magnesium, lithium, manganese, nickel, palladium, platinum, thorium, phosphorus, uranium and titanium, and/or at least one rare earth element and/or at least one rare metal. For example, the first metal can be aluminum. For example, the process can comprise reacting the first leachate with gaseous HCl so as to obtain the liquid and the precipitate comprising aluminum ions, the precipitate being formed by crystallization of AlCl3.6H2O. For example, the process can comprise reacting the first leachate with dry gaseous HCl so as to obtain the liquid and the precipitate comprising aluminum ions, the precipitate being formed by crystallization of AlCl3.6H2O. For example, the first leachate can comprise Al ions and/or Fe ions. For example, the Al ions can be substantially selectively precipitated from the first leachate under the form of AlCl3.6H2O. For example, the Al ions can be substantially selectively precipitated from the first leachate under the form of AlCl3.6H2O. For example, the Fe ions can be substantially selectively extracted by converting them into Fe2O3 via an hydrolysis. For example, the solid can comprise TiO2 and SiO2 and the solid is treated with Cl2 and carbon in order to obtain a liquid portion comprising titanium chloride and a solid portion, and wherein the solid portion and the liquid portion are separated from one another. For example, comprising heating titanium chloride so as to convert it into TiO2. According to one example as shown in FIG. 1, the processes can involve the following steps (the reference numbers in FIG. 1 correspond to the following steps): 1âThe aluminum-containing material is reduced to an average particle size of about 50 to about 80 Î¼m. 2âThe reduced and classified material is treated with hydrochloric acid which allows for dissolving, under a predetermined temperature and pressure, the aluminum with other elements like iron, magnesium and other metals including rare earth elements and/or rare metals. The silica and titanium (if present in raw material) remain totally undissolved. 3âThe mother liquor from the leaching step then undergoes a separation, a cleaning stage in order to separate the purified silica from the metal chloride in solution. The purified silica can then optionally undergo one or two additional leaching stages (for example at a temperature of about 150 to about 160Â° C.) so as to increase the purity of silica above 99.9%. TiO2 contained in silica can be separated from silica through a leach made by using HCl and MgCl2 as a lixiviant composition. 4âThe spent acid (leachate) obtained from step 1 is then brought up in concentration with dry and highly concentrated gaseous hydrogen chloride by sparging this one into a crystallizer. This results into the crystallization of aluminum chloride hexahydrate (precipitate) with a minimum of other impurities. Depending on the concentration of iron chloride at this stage, further crystallization step(s) can be required. The precipitate is then separated from the liquid. For example, particle size of crystals can be about 100 to about 500 microns, about 200 to about 400 microns, or about 200 to about 300 microns. Alternatively, particle size of crystals can be about 100 to about 200 microns, about 300 to about 400 microns or about 400 to 500 microns. 5âThe aluminum chloride hexahydrate is then calcined (for example by means of a rotary kiln, fluid bed, etc) at high temperature in order to obtain the alumina form. Highly concentrated gaseous hydrogen chloride is then recovered and excess is brought in aqueous form to the highest concentration possible so as to be used (recycled) in the acid leaching step. Acid can also be directly sent in gas phase to the acid purification stage to increase HCl concentration from about 30 wt % to about 95 wt %. This can be done, for example, during drying stage. 6âIron chloride (the liquid obtained from step 4) is then pre-concentrated and hydrolyzed at low temperature in view of the Fe2O3 (hematite form) extraction and acid recovery from its hydrolysis. All heat recovery from the calcination step (step 5), the leaching part exothermic reaction (step 1) and other section of the processes is being recovered into the pre-concentrator. 10âAfter the removal of hematite, a solution rich in rare earth elements and/or rare metals can be processed. As it can be seen in FIG. 3, an internal recirculation can be done (after the removal of hematite) and the solution rich in rare earth elements and/or rare metals can be used for crystallization stage 4. Extraction of the rare earth elements and/or rare metals can be done as described in PCT/CA2012/000253 and/or PCT/CA2012000419. These two documents are hereby integrated by reference in their entirety. Other non-hydrolysable metal chlorides (Me-Cl) such as MgCl2 and others then undergo the following steps: 7âThe solution rich in magnesium chloride and other non-hydrolysable products at low temperature is then brought up in concentration with dry and highly concentrated gaseous hydrogen chloride by sparging it into a crystallizer. This results into the precipitation of magnesium chloride as an hexahydrate, for example after sodium and potassium chloride removal. 8âMagnesium chloride hexahydrate is then calcined (either through a rotary kiln, fluid bed, etc.) and hydrochloric acid at very high concentration is thus regenerated and brought back to the leaching step. 9âOther Me-Cl undergo a standard pyrohydrolysis step where mixed oxides (Me-O) can be produced and hydrochloric acid at the azeotropic point (20.2% wt.) is regenerated. NaCl can undergo chemical reaction with H2SO4 to produce Na2SO4 and HCl at a concentration at or above azeotropic concentration. Moreover, KCl can undergo chemical reaction with H2SO4 to produce K2SO4 and HCl having a concentration that is above the azeotropic concentration. Sodium and potassium chloride brine solution can be the feed material to adapted small chlor-alkali electrolysis cells. In this latter case, common bases (NaOH and KOH) and bleach (NaOCl and KOCl) are produced as well as HCl. For example, the liquid can be concentrated to a concentrated liquid having an iron chloride concentration of at least 30% by weight; and then the iron chloride can be hydrolyzed at a temperature of about 155 to about 350Â° C. while maintaining a ferric chloride concentration at a level of at least 65% by weight, to generate a composition comprising a liquid and precipitated hematite, and recovering the hematite. For example, the liquid can be concentrated to a concentrated liquid having an iron chloride concentration of at least 30% by weight; and then the iron chloride can be hydrolyzed at a temperature of about 155 to about 350Â° C. while maintaining a ferric chloride concentration at a level of at least 65% by weight, to generate a composition comprising a liquid and precipitated hematite; recovering the hematite; and recovering rare earth elements and/or rare metals from the liquid. For example, the process can further comprise, after recovery of the rare earth elements and/or rare metals, reacting the liquid with HCl so as to cause precipitation of MgCl2, and recovering same. However, the person skilled in the art will understand that the continuous processes can handle high percentages of silica (>55%) and impurities as well as relatively low percentages of aluminum (for example as low as about 15%) and still being economically and technically viable. Satisfactory yields can be obtained (>93-95%) on Al2O3 and greater than 75%, 85 or 90% on rare earth elements and/or rare metals. No pre-thermal treatment in most cases are required. The processes disclosed in the present disclosure can involve special techniques on leaching and acid recovery at very high strength, thereby offering several advantages over alkaline processes. In step 1 the material to be treated, whether or not thermally treated is crushed, milled, dried and classified to have an average particle size of about 50 to about 80 Î¼m. In step 2. the milled material is introduced into the reactor and will undergo the leaching phase. The leaching hydrochloric acid used in step 2 can be a recycled or regenerated acid from steps 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 (see FIG. 3) its concentration can vary from 15% to 45% weight. percent. Higher concentration can be obtained using membrane separation, cryogenic and/or high pressure approach. The acid leaching can be carried out under pressure and at temperature close to its boiling point thus, allowing a minimal digestion time and extended reaction extent (90%-100%), Leaching (step 2) can be accomplished in a semi-continuous mode where spent acid with residual free hydrochloric acid is replaced by highly concentrated acid at a certain stage of the reaction or allowing a reduced acid/mineral ratio, thereby reducing reaction time and improving reaction kinetics. For example, kinetic constant k can be: 0.5-0.75 g/moleÂ·L. For example, leaching can be continuous leaching. As previously indicated, alkali metals, iron, magnesium, sodium, calcium, potassium, rare earth elements and other elements will also be in a chloride form at different stages. Silica and optionally titanium can remain undissolved and will undergo (step 3) a liquid/solid separation and cleaning stage. The processes of the present disclosure tend to recover maximum amount of free hydrochloric acid left and chlorides in solution in order to maximize hydrochloric acid recovery yield, using techniques such as rake classifying, filtration with band filters, high pressure, rotofilters centrifugation, and others. Pure SiO2 (one additional leaching stage) cleaning with nano water purity 99% min. Mother liquor free of silica is then named as spent acid (various metal chlorides and water) and goes to the crystallization step (step 4). Free HCl and chlorides recovery can be at least 99, 99.5, 99.9 or 99.99%. In step 4, the spent acid (or leachate) with a substantial amount of aluminum chloride is then saturated with dry and highly concentrated gaseous hydrogen chloride obtained or recycled from step 5 or with aqueous HCl >30% wt., which results in the precipitate of aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl3.6H2O). The precipitate retained is then washed and filtered or centrifuged before being fed to the calcination stage (step 5). The remaining of the spent acid from step 4 is then processed to acid recovery system (steps 6 to 8) where pure secondary products will be obtained. In step 5, aluminum oxide (alumina) is directly obtained from high temperature conditions. The highly concentrated hydrogen chloride in gaseous form obtained can be fed to steps 4 and 7 for crystallization where it can be treated through hydrophobic membranes. The excess hydrogen chloride is absorbed and used as regenerated acid to the leaching step 2 as highly concentrated acid, higher than the concentration at the azeotropic point (>20.2%). For example, such a concentration can be about 18 to about 45 weight %, about 25 to about 45 weight % or between 25 and 36 weight %. Acid can also be redirected in gas phase directly (>30 wt %) to acid purification. After step 4, various chlorides derivatives (mainly iron with magnesium and rare earth elements and rare metals) are next subjected to an iron extraction step. Such a step can be carried out for example by using the technology disclosed in WO 2009/153321, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Moreover, hematite can be seeded for crystal growth. For example, hematite seeding can comprise recirculating the seeding. In step 6, a hydrolysis at low temperature (155-350Â° C.) is carried out and pure Fe2O3 (hematite) is being produced and hydrochloric acid of at least 15% concentration is being regenerated. The method as described in WO 2009/153321 is processing the solution of ferrous chloride and ferric chloride, possible mixtures thereof, and free hydrochloric acid through a series of steps pre-concentration step, oxidation step where ferrous chloride is oxidized into ferric form, and finally through an hydrolysis step into an operational unit called hydrolyser where the ferric chloride concentration is maintained at 65 weight % to generate a rich gas stream where concentration ensures a hydrogen chloride concentration of 15-20.2% and a pure hematite that will undergo a physical separation step. Latent heat of condensation is recovered to the pre-concentration and used as the heating input with excess heat from the calcination stage (step 5). The mother liquor from the hydrolyser (step 6) can be recirculated partially to first step crystallization process where an increase in concentration of non-hydrolysable elements is observed. After iron removal, the liquor is rich in other non-hydrolysable elements and mainly comprises magnesium chloride or possible mixture of other elements (various chlorides) and rare earth elements and rare metals that are, for example, still in the form of chlorides. Rare earth elements and rare metals in form of chlorides are highly concentrated in percentage into the hydrolyser operational unit (step 6) and are extracted from the mother liquor (step 10) where various known techniques can be employed to extract a series of individual RE-O (rare earth oxides). Among others, the processes of the present disclosure allows to concentrate to high concentration the following elements, within the hydrolyser: scandium (Sc), galium (Ga), yttrium (Y), dysperosium (Dy), cerium (Ce), praseodynium (Pr), neodynium (Nd), europium (Eu), lanthanum (La), samarium (Sm), gadolinium, (Gd), erbium (Er), zirconium (Zr) and mixtures of thereof. Technologies that can be used for extracting rare earth elements and/or rare metals can be found, for example, in Zhou et al. in RARE METALS, Vol. 27, No. 3, 2008, p 223-227, and in US 2004/0042945, hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. The person skilled in the art will also understand that various other processes normally used for extracting rare earth elements and/or rare metals from the Bayer process can also be used. For example, various solvent extraction techniques can be used. For certain elements, a technique involving octylphenyl acid phosphate (OPAP) and toluene can be used. HCl can be used as a stripping agent. This can be effective for recovering Ce2O3, Sc2O3, Er2O3 etc. For example, different sequence using oxalic acid and metallic iron for ferric chloride separation can be used. The spent acid liquor from steps 6 and 10 rich in value added metals, mainly magnesium, is processed to step 7. The solution is saturated with dry and highly concentrated gaseous hydrogen chloride from step 5, which results in the precipitation of magnesium chloride hexahydrate. For example, same can be accomplished with HCl in aqueous form over 30% wt. The precipitate retained, is fed to a calcination stage step 8 where pure MgO (>98% wt.) is obtained and highly concentrated hydrochloric acid (for example of at least 38%) is regenerated and diverted to the leaching step (step 2). An alternative route for step 7 is using dry gaseous hydrochloric acid from step 8. In step 9, metal chlorides unconverted are processed to a pyrohydrolysis step (700-900Â° C.) to generate mixed oxides and where hydrochloric acid from 15-20.2% wt. concentration can be recovered. According to another example as shown in FIG. 3, the processes can be similar to the example shown in FIG. 1 but can comprise some variants as below discussed. In fact, as shown in FIG. 3, the processes can comprise (after step 6 or just before step 10) an internal recirculation back to the crystallization step 4. In such a case, The mother liquor from the hydrolyser (step 6) can be recirculated fully or partially to the crystallization of step 4 where a concentration increase will occur with respect to the non-hydrolysable elements including rare earth elements and/or rare metals. Such a step can be useful for significantly increasing the concentration of rare earth elements and/or rare metals, thereby facilitating their extraction in step 10. With respect to step 7, the solution rich in magnesium chloride and other non-hydrolysable products at low temperature is, as previously discussed, then brought up in concentration with dry and highly concentrated gaseous hydrogen chloride by sparging it into a crystallizer. This can result into the precipitation of magnesium chloride as an hexahydrate (for example after sodium and potassium chloride removal). This can also be accomplished with HCl in aqueous form. As shown in FIG. 3, an extra step 11 can be added. Sodium chloride can undergo a chemical reaction with sulfuric acid so as to obtain sodium sulfate and regenerate hydrochloric acid at a concentration at or above the azeotropic point. Potassium chloride can undergo a chemical reaction with sulfuric acid so as to obtain potassium sulfate and regenerate hydrochloric acid at a concentration above the azeotropic concentration. Sodium and potassium chloride brine solution can be the feed material to adapted small chlor-alkali electrolysis cells In this latter case, common bases (NaOH and KOH) and bleach (NaOCl and KOCl) are produced and can be reused to some extent in other areas of the processes of the present disclosure (scrubber, etc.). The process of FIG. 8 is also similar to the process of FIG. 1. The differences between the two processes reside steps 4 and 5. In fact, in steps 4 and 5 of the process of FIG. 8, different metals can be converted into a chloride and crystallized (step 4 of FIG. 8) and converted into an oxide by means of a calcination (step 5 of FIG. 8). The person skilled in the art will thus understand that depending on the composition of the material to be treated and the conditions of the leaching stage, different metals can thus be crystallized (step 4 of FIG. 6) and go through a calcination stage (step 5 of FIG. 8). The following are non-limitative examples. Example 1 Preparation of Alumina and Various Other Products As a starting material a sample of clay was obtained from the Grande VallÃ©e area in Quebec, Canada. These results represent an average of 80 tests carried out from samples of about 900 kg each. Crude clay in the freshly mined state after grinding and classification had the following composition: Al2O3: 15%-26%; SiO2: 45%-50%; Fe2O3: 8%-9%; MgO: 1%-2%; Rare earth elements and/or rare metals: 0.04%-0.07%; LOI: 5%-10%. This material is thereafter leached in a two-stage procedure at 140-170Â° C. with 18-32 weight % HCl. The HCl solution was used in a stoichiometric excess of 10-20% based on the stoichiometric quantity required for the removal of the acid leachable constituents of the clay. In the first leaching stage of the semi-continuous operation (step 2), the clay was contacted for 2.5 hours with required amount or certain proportion of the total amount of hydrochloric acid. After removal of the spent acid, the clay was contacted again with a minimum 18 weight % hydrochloric acid solution for about 1.5 hour at same temperature and pressure. A typical extraction curve obtained for both iron and aluminum for a single stage leaching is shown in FIG. 2. The leachate was filtered and the solid was washed with water and analyzed using conventional analysis techniques (see step 3 of FIG. 1). Purity of obtained silica was of 95.4% and it was free of any chlorides and of HCl. In another example, the purity of the silica was 99.67% through an extra leaching step. After the leaching and silica removal, the concentration of the various metal chlorides was: AlCl3: 15-20%; FeCl2: 4-6%; FeCl3: 0.5-2.0%; MgCl2: 0.5-2.0%; REE-Cl: 0.1-2% Free HCl: 5-50 g/l Spent acid was then crystallized using about 90 to about 98% pure dry hydrochloric acid in gas phase in two stages with less than 25 ppm iron in the aluminum chloride hexahydrate formed. The concentration of HCl in solution (aqueous phase) was about 22 to about 32% or 25 to about 32%, allowing 95.3% of Al2O3 recovery. The recovered crystallized material (hydrate form of AlCl3 having a minimum purity of 99.8%) was then calcined at 930Â° C. or 1250Â° C., thus obtaining the a form of the alumina. Heating at 930Â° C. allows for obtaining the beta-form of alumina while heating at 1250Â° C. allows for obtaining the alpha-form. Another example was carried out at low temperature (decomposition and calcination at about 350Â° C.) and the a form of the alumina was less than 2%. HCl concentration in gas phase exiting the calcination stage was having a concentration greater than 30% and was used (recycled) for crystallization of the AlCl3 and MgCl2. Excess of hydrochloric acid is absorbed at the required and targeted concentration for the leaching steps. Iron chloride (about 90-95% in ferric form) is then sent to a hydrothermal process in view of its extraction as pure hematite (Fe2O3). This can be done by using the technology described in WO 2009/153321 of low temperature hydrolysis with full heat recovery from calcining, pyrohydrolysis and leaching stage. Rare earth elements and rare metals are extracted from the mother liquor of the hydrolyzer where silica, aluminum, iron and a great portion of water have been removed and following preconcentration from hydrolyser to crystallization. It was observed that rare earth elements can be concentrated by a factor of about 4.0 to 10.0 on average within the hydrolyzer itself on a single pass through it i.e. without concentration loop. The following concentration factors have been noted within the hydrolyzer (single pass): Ce>6La>9Nd>7Y>9 Remaining magnesium chloride is sparged with dry and highly concentrated hydrochloric acid and then calcinated to MgO while recovering high concentration acid (for example up to 38.4%). Mixed oxides (Me-O) containing other non-hydrolysable components were then undergoing a pyrohydrolysis reaction at 700-800Â° C. and recovered acid (15-20.2% wt.) was rerouted for example to the leaching system. Overall Yields Obtained: Al2O3: 93.0-95.03% recovery; Fe2O3: 92.65-99.5% recovery; Rare earth elements: 95% minimum recovery (mixture); MgO: 92.64-98.00% recovery; Material discarded: 0-5% maximum; HCl global recovery: 99.75% minimum; HCl strength as feed to leaching 15-32% (aqueous); 95% (gas) Red mud production: none. Example 2 Preparation of Alumina and Various Other Products A similar feed material (bauxite instead of clay) was processed as per in example 1 up to the leaching stage and revealed to be easily leachable under the conditions established in example 1. It provided an extraction percentage of 100% for the iron and over 90-95% for aluminum. The technology was found to be economically viable and no harmful by-products (red mud) were generated. Samples tested had various concentrations of Al2O3 (up to 51%), Fe2O3 (up to 27%) and MgO (up to 1.5%). Gallium extraction of 97.0% was observed. Scandium extraction was 95%. Example 3 HCl Gas Enrichment and Purification: H2SO4 Route H2SO4 can be used for carrying out purification of HCl. It can be carried out by using a packing column with H2SO4 flowing counter currently (see FIG. 4). This allows for converting the recovered HCl into HCl having a concentration above the azeotropic point (20.1% wt) and increase its concentration by about 60 to about 70% at minimum. Water is absorbed by H2SO4 and then H2SO4 regeneration is applied where H2SO4 is brought back to a concentration of about 95 to about 98% wt. Water release at this stage free of sulphur is recycled back and used for crystallization dissolution, etc. Packing of the column can comprise polypropylene or polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT). Combustion energy can be performed with off gas preheating air and oxygen enrichment. Oxygen enrichment: +2% represents flame temperature increase by: 400Â° C. maximum. Example 4 HCl Gas Enrichment and Purification: Calcium Chloride to Calcium Chloride Hexahydrate (Absorption/Desorption Process) As shown in FIG. 5, CaCl2 can be used for drying HCl. In fact, CaCl2 can be used for absorbing water contained into HCl. In such a case, CaCl2 is converted into its hexachloride form (CaCl2.H2O) and one saturated system is eventually switched into regeneration mode where hot air recovered from calcination off gas of alumina and magnesium oxide spray roasting is introduced to regenerate the fixed bed. Alternatively, other absorbing agent such as LiCl can be used instead of CaCl2. Such an ion/exchange type process can be seen in FIG. 4 and the cycle can be inversed to switch from one column to another one. The person skilled in the art would understand that the processes described in examples 3 and 4 can be used in various different manners. For example, these processes can be combined with the various processes presented in the present disclosure. For example, such purifications techniques can be integrated to the processes shown in FIGS. 1, 3, 6 to 8, 10A, 10B, 11A and 11B. For example, these techniques can be used downstream of at least one of step chosen from steps 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 (see FIGS. 1 and 3). They can also be used downstream of step 4 and/or step 7. They can also be used downstream of at least one of step chosen from steps 104 to 111 (see FIG. 6) Example 5 Preparation of Alumina and Various Other Products This example was carried out by using a process as represented in FIGS. 6 and 7. It should be noted that the processes represented in FIGS. 6 and 7 differ only by the fact that FIG. 7 show to additional stages i.e. stages 112 and 113. Raw Material Preparation Raw material, clay for example, was processed in a secondary crusher in the clay preparation plant 101. Dry milling and classifying occurs on a dry basis in vertical roller mills (for example Fuller-Loesche LM 30.41). The clay preparation 101 included three roller mills; two running at a capacity of approximately 160-180 tph and one on standby. Raw material, if required, can be reduced to 85% less than 63 microns. Processed material was then stored in homogenization silos before being fed to the acid leaching plant 102. Below in Table 1 are shown results obtained during stage 101. If the ore contains the fluorine element, a special treatment can be applied before carrying out the 102 stage. In presence of hydrochloric acid, fluorine can produce hydrofluoric acid. This acid is extremely corrosive and damaging for human health. Thus, before leaching 102, an optional treatment fluorine separation 112 can be done. Stage 112 can comprise treating the processed material coming from stage 101 with an acid in a pre-leaching treatment so as to remove hydrofluoric acid. Therefore, depending on the composition of the raw material, a fluorine separation stage 112 (or pre-leaching stage 112) can be carried out. TABLE 1 Clay preparation Rate 290 tph Composition feed SiO2: 50.9% (main constituents) Al2O3: 24.0% Fe2O3: 8.51% CaO: 0.48% MgO: 1.33% Na2O: 1.06% K2O: 2.86% MnO: 0.16% Cr2O3: 0.01% TiO2: 0.85% P2O5: 0.145% SrO: 0.015% BaO: 0.05% V2O5 0.0321% Other (including 9.63% H2O and REE): Obtained particle size 85% < 63 Î¼m Residual moisture 0.5-0.7% Yield 99.5% min Acid Leaching Next, acid leaching 102 was performed semi-continuously in an 80 m3 glass-lined reactor. Semi-continuous mode comprises replacing reacted acid 1/3 in the reaction period with higher concentration regenerated acid, which greatly improves reaction kinetics. The reactor arrangement comprises for example, a series of three reactors. Other examples have been carried out with a first leaching at 1 atm was carried out and then, a second and third semi-continuous or continuous leaching was carried out with aqueous or gaseous HCl. Leaching was performed at high temperature and pressure (about 160 to about 195Â° C. and pressures of about 5 to about 8 barg) for a fixed period of time. Reaction time was a function of the reaction extent targeted (98% for Al2O3), leaching mode, acid strength, and temperature/pressure applied. Spent acid recovered out of the acid leaching 102 was then filtered 103 from unreacted silica and titanium dioxide and washed through an automated filter press where all free HCl and chloride are recovered. This allows, for example, a maximum quantity of about 30 ppm SiO2 going into spent liquor. Cleaned silica at a concentration of =96%+SiO2 is then produced. Various options are possible at that point. For example, the 96% silica can undergo final neutralization through caustic bath, cleaning, and then bricketing before storage. According to another example, the silica purified by adding another leaching step followed by a solid separation step that ensures TiO2 removal (see stage 113 in FIG. 7). In that specific case, high purity silica 99.5%+ is produced. In stage 113, titanium and silicium can be separated from one another in various manners. For example, the solid obtained from stage 103 can be leached in the presence of MgCl2 at a temperature below 90 or 80Â° C. and at low acid concentration. For example, acid concentration can be below 25 or 20%. The acid can be HCl or H2SO4. In such a case, titanium remains soluble after such a leaching while titanium is still in a solid form. These solid and liquid obtained after stage 113 are thus separated to provide eventually TiO2 and SiO2. Water input and flow for silica cleaning is in a ratio of 1:1 (silica/water) (150 t/h SiO2/150 t/h H2O), but comprises of wash water circulation in closed loop in the process and limited amount of process water for final cleaning of the silica and recovery of all chlorides and free HCl generated at the leaching stage. Below in Table 2 are shown results obtained during stage 102.

AlCl3.6H2O Crystallization Spent acid, with an aluminum chloride content of about 20 to about 30%, was then processed in the crystallization stage 104. Dry and highly concentrated HCl (>90% wt.) in gas phase was sparged in a two-stage crystallization reactor, which allows the crystallization of aluminum chloride hexahydrate. The flow rate of acid through these reactors is about 600 to about 675 m3/h and the reactor was maintained at about 50 to about 60Â° C. during this highly exothermic reaction. Heat was recovered and exchanged to the acid purification 107 part of the plant thus ensuring proper heat transfer and minimizing heat consumption of the plant. Aluminum chloride solubility decreases rapidly, compared to other elements, with the increase in concentration of free HCl in the crystallization reactor. The concentration of AlCl3 for precipitation/crystallization was about 30% The HCl concentration during crystallization was thus about 30 to about 32% wt. The aqueous solution from the crystallization stage 104 was then submitted to the hydrothermal acid recovery plant 105, while the crystals are processed through the decomposition/calcination stage in the calcination plant 106. A one-step crystallization stage or a multi-step crystallization stage can be done. For example, a two-steps crystallization stage can be carried out. Below in Tables 3A and 3B are shown results obtained during stage 104. TABLE 3A Aluminum chloride crystallization Number of crystallization steps 2 Operating temperature 50-60Â° C.

The preheating system can comprise a plasma torch to heat up steam to process. It processes crystals in the decomposition/calcination stage. The majority of the hydrochloric acid was released in the first stage which was operated at a temperature of about 350Â° C., while the second stage performs the calcination itself. Acid from both stages (about 66 to about 68% of the recovered acid from the processes) was then recovered and sent to either to the acid leaching 102 or to the acid purification 107. In the second reactor, which was operated at a temperature of about 930Â° C., acid was recovered through the condensation and absorption into two columns using mainly wash water from the acid leaching sector 102. Latent heat from this sector was recovered at the same time as large amounts of water, which limits net water input. In the iron oxides productions and acid recovery 105 system, which comprises, aqueous solution from the crystallization 104 first undergoes a pre-concentration stage followed by processing in the hydrolyzer reactor. Here, hematite was produced during low temperature processing (about 165Â° C.). A recirculation loop was then taken from the hydrolyzer and is recirculated to the pre-concentrator, allowing the concentration of REE, Mg, K, and other elements. This recirculation loop, allows rare earth element chlorides and/or rare metal chlorides and various metal chlorides concentration to increase without having these products precipitating with hematite up to a certain extent. Depending on acid balance in the plant, recovered acid is sent either directly to the 102 or 107 stage. Table 4 shows results obtained in stage 105.

The reactants were oxalic acid, NaOH, DEHPA (Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid) and TBP (tri-n-butyl phosphate) organic solution, kerosene, and HCl were used to convert rare earth element chlorides and rare metals chlorides to hydroxides. Countercurrent organic solvent with stripping of solution using HCl before proceeding to specific calcination from the rare earth elements and rare metals in form of hydroxide and conversion to high purity individual oxides. A ion exchange technique is also capable of achieving same results as polytrimethylen terephtalate (PET) membrane. Iron powder from 105, or scrap metal as FeO, can be used at a rate dependent on Fe3+ concentration in the mother liquor. HCl (100% wt) at the rate of 1 tph can be required as the stripped solution in REE Solvent Extraction (SX) separation and re-leaching of rare earth elements and/or rare metals oxalates. Water of very high quality, demineralized or nano, at the rate of 100 tph was added to the strip solution and washing of precipitates. Oxalic acid as di-hydrate at a rate of 0.2 tph was added and contributes to the rare earth elements and rare metals oxalates precipitation. NaOH or MgOH at a rate of 0.5 tph can be used as a neutralization agent. DEHPA SX organic solution at the rate of 500 g/h was used as active reagent in rare earth elements separation while TBP SX organic solution at the rate of 5 kg/h is used as the active reagent for gallium recovery and yttrium separation. Finally, a kerosene diluent was used at the rate of approximately 2 kg/h in all SX section. Calcination occurs in an electric rotary furnace via indirect heating to convert contents to REE2O3 (oxides form) and maintain product purity. Results of various tests made regarding stage 108 are shown in Table 6.

The solution after stages 108 and 109 contained mainly MgCl2, NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, FeCl2/FeCl3, and AlCl3 (traces), and then undergoes the 111 stage. Na, K, Ca that follows the MgO can be extracted in stage 110 by crystallization in a specific order; Na first, followed by K, and then Ca. This technique can be employed for example in the Israeli Dead Sea salt processing plant to produce MgO and remove alkali from the raw material. It was observed that the recirculation loop of FIG. 7 allows GaCl2 and ScCl2 to concentrate without precipitating with hematite. This stream then undergoes REE/RM extraction, followed by a series of solvent extraction stages and conversion to high purity individual oxides. Overall recovery yields of the REE elements reached 84% for Ga, 95% for Sc and 68% for the remaining REE present in low quantities. HCl Regeneration Alkali (Na, K), once crystallized, was sent and processed in the alkali hydrochloric acid regeneration plant 110 for recovering highly concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). The process chosen for the conversion can generate value-added products Various options are available to convert NaCl and KCl with intent of recovering HCl. One example can be to contact them with highly concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which generates sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) and potassium sulfate (K2SO4), respectively, and regenerates HCl at a concentration above 90% wt. Another example, is the use of a sodium and potassium chloride brine solution as the feed material to adapted small chlor-alkali electrolysis cells. In this latter case, common bases (NaOH and KOH) and bleach (NaOCl and KOCl) are produced. The electrolysis of both NaCl and KCl brine is done in different cells where the current is adjusted to meet the required chemical reaction. In both cases, it is a two-step process in which the brine is submitted to high current and base (NaOH or KOH) is produced with chlorine (Cl2) and hydrogen (H2). H2 and Cl2 are then submitted to a common flame where highly concentrated acid in gas (100% wt.) phase is produced and can be used directly in the crystallization stage 104, or to crystallization stages requiring dry highly concentrated acid. Magnesium Oxide The reduced flow, which was substantially free of most elements (for example AlCl3, FeCl3, REE-Cl, NaCl, KCl) and rich in MgCl2, was then submitted to the magnesium oxides plant 111. In the MgO, pyrohydrolysis of MgCl2 and any other leftover impurities were converted into oxide while regenerating acid. The first step was a pre-evaporator/crystallizer stage in which calcium is removed and converted into gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) by a simple chemical reaction with sulfuric acid, for which separation of MgO is required. This increases the capacity of MgO roasting and also energy consumption slightly, while substantially recovering HCl. The next step was the specific pyrohydrolysis of MgO concentrated solution by spray roasting. Two (2) main products were generated; MgO that was further treated and HCl (about 18% wt.), which was either recycled back to the upstream leaching stage 102 or to the hydrochloric acid purification plant (107 The MgO-product derived from the spray roaster can require further washing, purification, and finally calcining depending on the quality targeted. The purification and calcining can comprise a washing-hydration step and standard calcining step. The MgO from the spray roaster is highly chemically active and was directly charged into a water tank where it reacts with water to form magnesium hydroxide, which has poor solubility in water. The remaining traces of chlorides, like MgCl2, NaCl, dissolved in water. The Mg(OH)2 suspension, after settling in a thickener, was forwarded to vacuum drum filters, which remove the remaining water. The cleaned Mg(OH)2 is then forwarded into a calcination reactor where it is exposed to high temperatures in a vertical multi-stage furnace. Water from hydration is released and allows the transformation of the Mg(OH)2 to MgO and water. At this point, the magnesium oxide was of high purity (>99%). HCl Purification The hydrochloric acid purification stage 107 is effective for purifying HCl regenerated from different sectors (for example 105, 106, 111) and to increase its purity for crystallization, whereas dry highly concentrated acid (>90% wt.) can be used as the sparging agent. Stage 107 also allowed for controlling the concentration of the acid going back to stage 102 (about 22 to about 32% wt.) and allows total acid and water balance. Total plant water balance is performed mainly by reusing wash water as absorption medium, as quench agent or as dissolution medium at the crystallization stages. For example, stage 107 can be carried out by using the processes shown in FIG. 4 or in FIG. 5. For example, purification can be carried out by means of a membrane distillation process. The membrane distillation process applied here occurs when two aqueous liquids with different temperatures are separated through a hydrophobic membrane. The driving force of the process was supplied by the partial pressure vapour difference caused by the temperature gradient between these solutions. Vapour travels from the warm to the cold side. Without wishing to be bound to such a theory, the separation mechanism was based on the vapour/liquid equilibrium of the HCl/water liquid mixture. Practical application of such a technology has been applied to HCl/water, H2SO4/water systems and also on large commercial scales on aqueous solution of sodium chloride with the purpose of obtaining potable water from seawater and nano water production. Therefore membrane distillation was a separation process based on evaporation through a porous hydrophobic membrane. The process was performed at about 60Â° C. and was effective to recover heat from the 104 and 102 stage with an internal water circulation loop, in order to maintain a constant incoming temperature to the membranes. For example, eight membranes of 300,000 m2 equivalent surface area can be used per membrane to obtain a concentration of HCl well above the azeotropic point (i.e. >36%) of the =750 m3/h and final 90% concentration is then obtained through pressure distillation (rectification column). Purification of HCl by processing thus regenerated acid through hydrophobic membrane and separating water from HCl; therefore increasing HCl concentration up to about 36% (above azeotropic point) and therefore allowing with a single stage of rectification through a pressure stripping column to obtain >90% in gaseous phase, for crystallization stage (sparging); and therefore controlling acid concentration into crystallization stages up to 30-35%(aq). As indicated stage 107 was operated at about 60Â° C. and heat input provided by heat recovery from stages 102 to 110. Rectification column was operated at about 140Â° C. in the reboiler part. Net energy requirement was neutral (negative in fact at â3.5 Gj/t Al2O3) since both systems were in equilibrium and in balance. For example, the acid purification can be carried out by using adsorption technology over an activated alumina bed. In continuous mode, at least two adsorption columns are required to achieve either adsorption in one of them and regeneration in the other one. Regeneration can be performed by feeding in counter-current a hot or depressurized gas. This technology will result in a purified gas at 100% wt. For example, the acid purification can be made by using calcium chloride as entrainer of water. A lean hydrochloric acid solution is contacted with a strong calcium chloride solution through a column. The water is then removed from the hydrochloric acid solution and 99.9% gaseous HCl comes out of the process. Cooling water and cryogenic coolant is used to condense water traces in the HCl. The weak CaCl2 solution is concentrated by an evaporator that ensures the recuperation of calcium chloride. Depending on the impurities in the incoming HCl solution feed to the column, some metals can contaminate the calcium chloride concentrated solution. A precipitation with Ca(OH)2 and a filtration allows the removal of those impurities. The column can operate for example at 0.5 barg. This technology can allow for the recuperation of 98% of the HCl.

Example 6 Another starting material has been used for preparing acidic compositions comprising various components. In fact, a material that is a concentrate of rare earth elements and rare metals (particularly rich in zirconium) has been tested. Table 27 shows the results of the leaching carried out on such a starting material using a similar process as shown in FIGS. 1, 3, 6 and 7 and as detailed in Examples 1, 2 and 5. It can thus be inferred from the results shown in Table 27 that the various components present in the leaching (various metals such as aluminum, iron, magnesium as well as rare earth elements and rare metals) can be extracted from the obtained leaching composition and that they can eventually be isolated by the processes of the present disclosure such as, for example, those presented in Examples 1, 2 and 5. Example 7 Other tests have been made in a similar manner as described in Example 6. In the present example, carbonatite has been used as a starting material. (see Table 28 below).

These various products or components present in the obtained leachate can thus be all isolated and eventually transformed as previously indicated in the processes of the present disclosure. The obtained leachate can then be treated as described in the processes of the present disclosure. The leaching stage of example 8 can be considered, for example, as the leaching stage 2 of FIG. 1 or FIG. 3; the leaching stage 102 of FIG. 6 or FIG. 7; the leaching stage 2 of FIG. 8, the leaching 202 of FIG. 10A, the leaching 302 of FIG. 11A etc. For example, the leachate obtained in Example 8 can then be treated as shown in FIGS. 1, 3, 6 to 8, 10A, 10B, 11A and 11B. For example, the leachate can be treated as described in Examples 1, 2 and 5. FIG. 9 shows a method for separating Si from Ti. For example, when using an ore as starting material, leaching can be carried out in the presence of Cl2 so as to maintain Ti under the form of TiCl4 since in remains in solution while Si remains solid (SiO2). Then, Ti can be injected into a plasma torch for being purified. Such a method for purifying Si and Ti can be used in all the processes of the present disclosure when there is a need for separating these two entities. For example, see stage 113 in FIG. 7 The processes shown in FIGS. 10A/10B and 11A/11B are processes that can be useful for treating various materials that comprise, for example, Mg and other metals such as Ni and/or Co. These materials can also comprise other metals such as aluminum, iron etc. These processes can thus be effective for treating red mud. The processes of FIGS. 10A/10B and FIGS. 11A/11B are similar, with the exception that magnesium remains in solution after step 204 in FIGS. 10A/10B (see step 211) while magnesium is precipitated after step 304 in FIGS. 11A/11B (see step 311). Certain steps carried out in the processes of FIGS. 10A/10B and 11A/11B are similar to the steps of other processes described in the present disclosure. For example, steps 201 and 301 are similar to step 101 of FIGS. 6 and 7. Moreover, steps 202 and 302 of FIGS. 10A/10B and 11A/10B are similar to step 102 of FIGS. 6 and 7. Steps 203 and 303 of FIGS. 10A/B and 11A/B are similar to step 103 of FIGS. 6 and 7. Steps 213 and 313 of FIGS. 11 and 12 are similar to step 113 of FIG. 7. With respect to steps 214 and 314, TiO2 can eventually be purified by means of a plasma torch. Eventually, CaSO4.2H2O (gypsum) can be produced as detailed in steps 223 and 323. Finally, pursuant to steps 224, 324, 225 and 325 Na2SO4 and K2SO4 can be produced. With respects to steps 213 and 313, TiO2 can be converted into titanium chloride so as to solubilize the titanium in a liquid phase. For example, this can be done by reacting TiO2 with Cl2 and carbon (C). Therefore, SiO2 and titanium can be separated from one another since SiO2 remains solid while titanium chloride will be solubilized. For example, steps 213, 313, 214 and 314 can be carried out as detailed in FIG. 9. Such processes are also efficient for achieving whole recovery of HCl. Pursuant to Ni and/or Co precipitation (step 212) LiOH can be precipitated and eventually washed in steps 208. Ni and Co are then purified by means of solvent extraction 207. The person skilled in the art would thus be able to select appropriate conditions for separating these two metals. Examples of such different manners of separating Ni from Co are disclosed in US 2011/0283838, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Then, a further leaching can be carried out in step 209 so as to extract further metals. After step 304 related to the MgO separation, LiCl can be crystallized an washed (stage 308). After step 305, Hematite is obtained and Ni and Co are precipitated (stage 312). Ni and Co can then be separated from one another by using the above-mentioned techniques (solvent extraction) referred to when describing stage 207. For example, if the starting material to be used in the processes of FIGS. 10A, 10B, 11A and 11B contains aluminum, steps 210 and 310 can be carried out so as to precipitate AlCl3. Such a step (210 or 310) is similar to step 104 carried out in FIGS. 6 and 7. In an analogous manner, steps 205 and 305 of FIGS. 10A, 10B, 11A and 11B are similar to step 105 of FIGS. 6 and 7. Steps 206 and 306 of FIGS. 10A, 10B, 11A and 11B are similar to step 106 of FIGS. 6 and 7. HCl purification carried out in steps 215 and 315 is similar to step 107 carried out in FIGS. 6 and 7. As it can be seen in FIGS. 10A, 10B, 11A and 11B 216 and 316, HCl is thus regenerated. Alternatively, pursuant to step 209, and depending on the composition of the starting material used for the processes of FIGS. 10A, 10B, 11A and 11B, steps 210 and 310 can be omitted or bypassed. Therefore, if substantially no aluminum is comprised within the starting material, or if the content in aluminum is considerably low after step 209, step 249 can be carried out. Then, pursuant to steps 249 and 349 of FIGS. 10A, 10B, 11A and 11B, in which a mixture of various metal chlorides are obtained, calcination can be carried out in steps 217 and 317 so as to eventually obtain a mixture of various metal oxides. Impurities obtained in steps 210 and 310 can be crystallized in steps 218 and 318. By doing so, NaCl (steps 219 and 319) and KCl (steps 221 and 321) can be crystallized. An electrolysis of NaCl (steps 220 and 320) and KCl (steps 222 and 322) can be carried out as previously indicated in the present disclosure. The processes of the present disclosure provide a plurality of advantages and distinction over the known processes The processes of the present disclosure provide fully continuous and economical solutions that can successfully extract alumina from various type of materials while providing ultra pure secondary products of high added value including highly concentrated rare earth elements and rare metals. The technology described in the present disclosure allows for an innovative amount of total acid recovery and also for a ultra high concentration of recovered acid. When combing it to the fact that combined with a semi-continuous leaching approach that favors very high extraction yields and allows a specific method of crystallization of the aluminum chloride and concentration of other value added elements. These processes also allow for preparing aluminum with such a produced alumina. A further advantage of the processes of the present disclosure is the combined high temperature and high incoming hydrochloric acid concentration. Combined with a semi continuous operation where the free HCl driving force is used systematically, iron and aluminum extraction yields do respectively reach 100% and 98% in less than about 40% of the reference time of a basic batch process. Another advantage of higher HCl concentration than the concentration at azeotropic point is the potential of capacity increase. Again a higher HCl concentration than the concentration of HCl at the azeotropic point and the semi-continuous approach represent a substantial advance in the art. Another advantage in that technique used for the mother liquor separation from the silica after the leaching stage countercurrent wash, is that band filters provide ultra pure silica with expected purity exceeding 96%. The crystallization of AlCl3 into AlCl3.6H2O using dried, cleaned and highly concentrated gaseous HCl as the sparging agent allows for a pure aluminum chloride hexahydrate with only few parts per million of iron and other impurities. A minimal number of stages can be required to allow proper crystal growth. The direct interconnection with the calcination of AlCl3.6H2O into Al2O3 which does produce very high concentration of gas allows the exact adjustment in continuous of the HCl concentration within the crystallizer and thus proper control of the crystal growth and crystallization process. The applicant has thus demonstrated that their processes are effective to separates the individual valuable and marketable components of the red mud (or the selected material to be treated) sequentially and recycles the acid used. These processes therefore allow the recovery of a large part of the alumina normally wasted in the Bayer process. The processes of the present disclosure thus offer a unique solution to these large red mud ponds, remediation, while allowing a quick return on investment due to the recovery of alumina and other value added products separated and purified through the acid regeneration stage. These results demonstrate that the processes of the present disclosure represent an innovative and economical technology is not only a viable alternative for alumina production from a variety of aluminous ores without generating red mud but also a means to remediate the existing red mud toxic residues that represent an environmental liability for the alumina and aluminium industries. Although the initial composition of red mud can vary depending on the bauxite origin, the operating conditions, etc.; the processes of the present disclosure have the flexibility to process raw material feed of various compositions. This enables the treatment of red mud coming out of any alumina plant. Different sources of red mud from different areas in the world were successfully tested. The applicant has now discovered fully integrated and continuous processes with substantially total hydrochloric acid recovery for the extraction of alumina and other value added products from various materials that contain aluminum (clay, bauxite, aluminosilicate materials, slag, red mud, fly ashes etc.) containing aluminum. In fact, the processes allows for the production of substantially pure alumina and other value added products purified such as purified silica, pure hematite, titanium oxide, pure other minerals (ex: magnesium oxide) rare earth elements, and rare metals products. In addition, the processes do not require thermal pre-treatment before the acid leach operation. Acid leach is carried out using semi-continuous techniques with high pressure and temperature conditions and very high regenerated hydrochloric acid concentration. In addition, the processes do not generate any residues not sellable, thus eliminating harmful residues to environment like in the case of alkaline processes. The advantage of the high temperature calcination stage, in addition for allowing to control the Î±-form of alumina required, is effective for providing a concentration of hydrochloric acid in the aqueous form (>38%) that is higher than the concentration of HCl at the azeotropic point and thus providing a higher incoming HCl concentration to the leaching stage. The calcination stage hydrochloric acid network can be interconnected to two (2) crystallization systems and by pressure regulation excess HCl can be being absorbed at the highest possible aqueous concentration. The advantage of having a hexahydrate chloride with low moisture content (<2%) incoming feed allows for a continuous basis to recover acid at a concentration that is higher than the azeotropic concentration. This HCl balance and double usage into three (3) common parts of the processes and above azeotropic point is a substantial advance in the art. Another advantage is the use of the incoming chemistry (ferric chloride) to the iron oxide and hydrochloric acid recovery unit where all excess heat load from any calcination part, pyrohydrolysis and leaching part is being recovered to preconcentrate the mother liquor in metal chloride, thus allowing, at very low temperature, the hydrolysis of the ferric chloride in the form of very pure hematite and the acid regeneration at the same concentration than at its azeotropic point. A further major advantage of the instant process at the ferric chloride hydrolysis step is the possibility to concentrate rare earth elements in form of chlorides at very high concentration within the hydrolyser reactor through an internal loop between hydrolyzer and crystallization. The advantage in that the processes of the present disclosure benefit from the various steps where gradual concentration ratios are applied. Thus, at this stage, in addition to an internal concentration loop, having the silica, the aluminum, the iron and having in equilibrium a solution close to saturation (large amount of water evaporated, no presence of free hydrochloric acid) allows for taking rare earth elements and non-hydrolysable elements in parts per million into the incoming feed and to concentrate them in high percentage directly at the hydrolyser after ferric chloride removal Purification of the specific oxides (RE-O) can then be performed using various techniques when in percentage levels. The advantage is doubled here: concentration at very high level of rare earth elements using integrated process stages and most importantly the approach prevents from having the main stream (very diluted) of spent acid after the leaching step with the risk of contaminating the main aluminum chloride stream and thus affecting yields in Al2O3. Another improvement of the art is that on top of being fully integrated, selective removal of components allows for the concentration of rare earth elements to relatively high concentration (percentages). Another advantage of the process is again a selective crystallization of MgCl2 through the sparging of HCl from either the alumina calcination step or the magnesium oxide direct calcination where in both cases highly concentrated acid both in gaseous phase or in aqueous form are being generated. As per aluminum chloride specific crystallization, the direct interconnection with the calcination reactor, the HCl gas very high concentration (about 85 to about 95%, about 90 to 95% or about 90% by weight) allows for exact adjustment in continuous of the crystallizer based on quality of magnesium oxide targeted. Should this process step (MgO production or other value added metal oxide) be required based on incoming process feed chemistry, the rare earth elements and rare metals extraction point then be done after this additional step; the advantage being the extra concentration effect applied. The pyrohydrolysis allows for the final conversion of any remaining chloride and the production of refined oxides that can be used (in case of clay as starting material) as a fertilizer and allowing the processing of large amount of wash water from the processes with the recovery hydrochloric acid in close loop at the azeotropic point for the leaching step. The advantage of this last step is related to the fact that it does totally close the process loop in terms of acid recovery and the insurance that no residues harmful to the environment are being generated while processing any type of raw material, as previously described. A major contribution to the art is that the proposed fully integrated processes of the present disclosure is really allowing, among others, the processing of bauxite in an economic way while generating no red mud or harmful residues. In addition to the fact of being applicable to other natural of raw materials (any suitable aluminum-containing material or aluminous ores), the fact of using hydrochloric acid total recovery and a global concentration that is higher than the concentration at the azeotropic point (for example about 21% to about 38%), the selective extraction of value added secondary products and compliance (while remaining highly competitive on transformation cost) with environmental requirements, represent major advantages in the art. It was thus demonstrated that the present disclosure provides fully integrated processes for the preparation of pure aluminum oxide using a hydrochloric acid treatment while producing high purity and high quality products (minerals) and extracting rare earth elements and rare metals. While a description was made with particular reference to the specific embodiments, it will be understood that numerous modifications thereto will appear to those skilled in the art.
