A removable band which is attached across the upper rim of the visor of the helmet with a wiper that moves horizontally across the visor to remove rain water with a control switch placed on the side of the helmet. This can be stored in the motorbike and then placed on the visor when it is raining. In addition it could fit many models of helmet and would not need to be fitted to different models at the factory. Alternatively it can be left permanently attached. As far as I know this is a unique design of helmet wiper which is more convenient and cosmetically pleasing than a larger unit that is attached to the top shell of the helmet.
