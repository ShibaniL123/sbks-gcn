[Example 2] Synthesis of 5-methylmenthyl carboxylic acid methyl ester (methyl 2-isopropyl-5,5-dimethylcyclohexane carboxylate) (Exemplary Compound 15a-6)
Under a nitrogen atmosphere, magnesium (1.51 g, 1.30 eq.) was added to a 200-mL four-necked flask equipped with a condenser and a dropping funnel, and 5-methylmenthyl chloride (9.00 g, 47.7 mmol) obtained in Synthesis Example 6 and THF (40 mL) were added to the dropping funnel. The flask internal temperature was heated to 45° C., and the solution in the funnel was dropped over 1 hour while stirring. Dimethyl carbonate (8.03 mL, 2.00 eq.) and THF (5 mL) were added to the funnel, and then dropped over about 40 minutes. After completion, the temperature in the system was increased to 55° C., and followed by heating and stirring for 8 hours in total. As a post-treatment, the inside of the system was cooled, and the reaction was completed with an aqueous ammonium chloride solution, and a crude product obtained by a conventional method was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (heptane/ethyl acetate=6/1), whereby an objective substance was obtained as a colorless oil (9.13 g, 43.0 mmol, yield: 90%).
