BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The invention is directed to compositions and methods for treating hair, and in particular to methods and compositions for imparting thickness, volume, texture and definition, which permit improved styling. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART Hair treatment products on the market typically use commercial polymers to impart volume, texture, definition and thickness. People with fine or thin hair regularly use "volumizing" products in the form of shampoos, conditioners, styling sprays, creams, gels, or mousses in an effort to increase the volume and body of their hair. Many of these materials are polyvinylpyrrolidone/ polyvinyl acetate (PVP/VA) combinations. These materials create volume in hair by binding multiple hair fibers together in spot-welds, such that a droplet of the product lands on a section of the hair thereby linking a hair fiber back on itself and/or linking two or more fibers, creating stiffer hair, more resistant to, for example, falling flat on the head. This technology suffers from several drawbacks, as the visual benefits obtained do not last and the hair is left feeling stiff or crunchy. Thus, it is desired to identify and develop compositions that achieve these results with greater ease of use, less heaviness and less feeling of sticky residue, that do not impart a crunchy or stiff feeling to the hair, and which impart shine and softness to the hair as well as volume and thickness. Preparation of poly(β-amino esters) from conjugate addition of bis(secondary amines) or primary amines to a bis(acrylate ester) is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,998,115 and 7,427,394, and related applications, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Many of the compounds within the scope of the disclosure are said to be biodegradable and biocompatible and said to be useful in a variety of drug delivery systems. However, use in cosmetics is not contemplated in these patents. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Whereas advances in the art typically involve new formulations of known compounds, the inventors herein have brought real innovation to the field of hair treatment at the compound level, developing new molecular entities for use in styling hair. Of particular interest are hair styling compositions that avoid reliance on conventional high-molecular weight PVP/VA compounds, that provide a lighter, more natural feel, while still providing thickness, texture, volume and definition. In one aspect, the invention involves the use of the compounds such as are disclosed in US Patent Nos. 7,427,394 and 6,998,115; US Patent Application Publication Nos. US 2004/0071654 and US 2005/0265961; and International Application Nos. WO 02/31025; WO 04/106411 and WO 07/143659 with a cosmetically acceptable carrier in a composition for treatment of hair. The disclosure of each of the aforesaid patents and published applications is incorporated by reference herein. Thus, in one aspect, the invention is a hair treatment composition comprising a compound according to formula (I) or (I')in a cosmetically acceptable carrier: In formula (I) and (I'), n is an integer between 1 and 10,000; and Z and Z', together with the atoms to which they are attached, represent acrylate, methacrylate or amino end groups. The substituent R2 is the residue of a primary amine starting material, which may be reacted with a diacrylate or dimethacrylate starting material, to form the compound according to formula (I) or (I'), as described in greater detail below. For example, R2 may be selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, amino, aminoalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, amido, alkylthioether, carbamoyl, carbonyldioxyl, carboxyl ester, cyclic aliphatic, cyclic heteroaliphatic, aromatic, heteroaromatic and ureido groups, each of which groups may be substituted with at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, alkoxy, alkoxylalkyl, amino, aminoalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, amido, cyclic aliphatic, heterocyclic aliphatic, halogen, hydroxyl, cyano, carbamoyl, carboxylic acid, carbonyldioxyl, alkylthioether, siloxyl, and thiohydroxyl groups. A is a carbon chain or a heteroatom-containing carbon chain, optionally substituted with at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, trialkylamino, aminoalkyl aryl, ureido, heterocyclic, aromatic heterocyclic, cyclic, aromatic cyclic, halogen, hydroxyl, alkoxy, cyano, amido, carbamoyl, carboxylic acid, ester, carbonyl, carbonyldioxyl, alkylthioether, and thiol groups; wherein said substituents may join to form one or more rings. Alternatively, a bis(amine) is used as a starting material and is reacted with the diacrylate or dimethacrylate starting material so that the hair treatment composition comprises a compound according to formula (II) or (II'). In formula (II) and (II'), A, n, Z and Z' are as defined for formula (I); R3 and R4 are defined as for R2 in Formula (I); and B and A arc, independently, a carbon chain or a heteroatom-containing carbon chain, optionally substituted with at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, trialkylamino, aminoalkyl, aryl, ureido, heterocyclic, aromatic heterocyclic, cyclic, aromatic cyclic, halogen, hydroxyl, alkoxy, cyano, amido, carbamoyl, carboxylic acid, ester, carbonyl, carbonyldioxyl, alkylthioether, and thiol groups. In another aspect of the invention, oligomers are provided which have β-amino ester monomer units bonded to blocks of repeating monomer units (such as polybutadiene blocks). In particular, it has now been found that compounds having a β-amino ester moiety and a rubber moiety in novel and useful hair treatment compositions avoid the drawbacks of the volumizing products known in the prior art. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the β-amino, ester compounds disclosed herein bind to the hair fibers to increase inter-fiber friction and produce benefits not delivered through conventional technology. The inventive composition increase friction in hair while allowing hair fibers to remain free to move, allowing for a more natural feel. In addition, the inventive compositions afford longer lasting and re-shapeable hair styles. Fibers are free to separate and re-attach at different points, allowing for a more natural feel and movement. These effects are achieved according to the invention using the compositions and methods described herein. As a result, the present inventive compositions and methods are believed to avoid making the hair feel stiff or crunchy. Thus, in this further aspect, the invention is a hair treatment composition comprising a compound according to formula (I) or formula (II) wherein A is a rubber moiety, such as, without limitation, a moiety made up of one or more units of butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene, styrene-butadiene, mixtures thereof, or variations thereof. In preferred embodiments, a hair treatment composition according to the invention comprises a compound of formula (III) in a cosmetically acceptable carrier: In the above formula (III), n is an integer between 1 and 10,000; y is an integer between 1 and 10,000; and R2 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, amino, aminoalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, amido, alkylthioether, carbamoyl, carbonyldioxyl, carboxyl ester, cyclic aliphatic, cyclic heteroaliphatic, aromatic, heteroaromatic and ureido groups, each of which groups may be substituted with at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, alkoxy, alkoxylalkyl, amino, aminoalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, amido, cyclic aliphatic, heterocyclic aliphatic, halogen, hydroxyl, cyano, carbamoyl, carboxylic acid, carbonyldioxyl, alkylthioether, siloxyl, and thiohydroxyl groups. Alternatively, a hair treatment composition according to the invention may comprise a compound according to formula (IV) in a cosmetically suitable carrier, wherein y, n, Z, Z', B, R3 and R4 are all defined as set forth above with respect to formulas (I), (II) and (III): Methods according to the invention comprise the step of contacting scalp hair with the composition containing a compound according to any of formulas (I) through (IV) in a cosmetically acceptable carrier, as described in greater detail in the detailed description that follows.

Thus, for example, a reference to "a monomer" includes a plurality of such monomers. The term "keratin" as used herein refers any one of a class of fibrous structural proteins found in hair, wool, and nails. Keratin proteins contains a large quantity of cysteine residues. Human hair is a keratin that has approximately 15% cysteine residues cross-linked by disulfide bridges.

In particular, a compound according to the invention containing less than 10 β-amino ester groups is considered an oligomer, notwithstanding the size of the block connecting the amino ester groups. The term "polymer," as used herein, refers to a chemical compound of repeating structural units (monomers) connected by covalent bonds. A polymer is typically of high molecular weight comprising 10s to 100s to 1000s or even more monomers. However, as used herein, the term "polymer" also includes "oligomers."

These units incorporated in a molecule constitute the "rubber moiety" of the molecule, as that term is used herein. The symbol in a chemical structure means that different atoms and/or bonds may be found at that position. Thus, in formula (I), A is designated with symbol because a number of options exist for the configuration of A. In connection with the end groups, to form an acrylate or methacrylate end group, for example, Z means that Z and the carbon to which it is attached form a CH2= terminus of the acrylate or methacrylate end group. Alternatively, in the same formula, the symbol may represent a bond with the next monomer repeat group.

If the starting material is a dimethacrylate, the above reactions form compounds represented by the corresponding formulas (I') and (II'), wherein A, B, Z, Z' and n are as defined above for formulas (I) and (II): Where the starting material is a diacrylate, the above reactions form compounds represented by the corresponding formulas (I) and (II): Such compounds include, without limitation, the compounds disclosed in the aforementioned patents and published applications incorporated by reference. In an embodiment of the present invention, n is in the range of 1 to 10,000. In certain other embodiments of the present invention, n is in the range of 1 to 1,000, 1 to 100 or 3 to 10. In preferred embodiments, the acrylate or methacrylate moieties in the compounds are linked by a relatively high molecular weight moiety A. In the presently preferred embodiments, A is a rubber moiety, including without limitation, a material comprising monomers selected from butadiene, styrene-butadiene, chloroprene, and isoprene monomers. Rubber-containing materials that may be reacted to form a polymer according to the invention include, without limitation, polybutadiene diacrylate, which is represented by the formula or its corresponding dimethacrylate. Polyisoprene diacrylate may also be used, represented by the following formula, The corresponding dimethacrylate may also be used. In these starting materials m may be 1 to 60, and in certain embodiments 1 to 40, 1 to 30 or 20 to 30. Alternatively, polychloroprene or styrene-butadiene rubbers may be modified into diacrylates or dimethacrylates, which can then be reacted according to the general reaction schemes I and II above. Styrene/butadiene rubbers have the following general structure: Poly-chloroprene has the general structure In presently preferred embodiments polybutadiene diacrylates (PBDs) are employed as a starting material. Although not limiting the invention, diacrylates and dimethacrylates having a number average molecular weight in the range of 1000 g/mol to 5,000 g/mol may be used. In the examples elaborated below, two different starting material were used, having a number average molecular weight of 1400 g/mol and 3000 g/mol, respectively. In other embodiments, A is an optionally substituted carbon chain or heteroatom containing carbon chain containing 1 to 30 atoms in the chain. Thus, in some instances, 1,4-butanediol diacrylate, 1,4-butanediol dimethacrylate, 1,2-ethanediol diacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, 2,5-hexanediol diacrylate, and 1,3-propanediol diacrylate may be used as a diacrylate starting material, such that A comprises a carbon chain having less than 30 atoms. The linker A between the acrylate or methacrylate moieties of the compound may comprise a substituted carbon chain wherein the substituents join to form one or more rings. For example, such multicyclic moiety A may be represented by the formula The corresponding compound useful in a hair treatment composition according to the invention has the following formula, wherein Z, Z' and R2 are as described above.: Alternatively, linker A may comprise a carbon chain or heteroatom-containing carbon chain having one or more aromatic substituents on the chain, resulting in compounds according to the following formula, The diacrylate or dimethacrylate starting material may be reacted with amines having varying functional groups at varying ratios. For example, acceptable PBD:amine ratios may range from about 1: 2 to about 2: 1. In the examples elaborated below, PBD:amine ratios were varied between 1:1.8 and 1:1.2. The compounds according to the invention, resulting from the above-described reaction, sometimes have small amounts of unreacted amine. In preferred embodiments, the compound used in the composition according to the invention contains less than 1 wt%, preferably less than 0.1 wt% percent, and more preferably less than 0.01 wt% unreacted amine. A suitable diacrylate or dimethacrylate may be reacted with a primary amine having a formula NH2R (where R2 is as defined above) by Michael Addition. The R2 group on the primary amine may be selected to impart desired properties to the composition. Thus, the amine may be selected to modify the properties imparted to the composition by the rubber moiety, to reduce a greasy, heavy feel while maintaining the frictional attributes obtained with the rubber, for example. Alternatively, hydrophilic groups may be incorporated into the compound via the amine to improve water solubility.

General Synthetic Procedure The synthesis of the compounds described below was performed in 30ml clear glass jars with phenolic caps lined with polyethylene core liners, and stirred with 15.9x9.5mm Teflon® coated spin bar. For each reaction, 5g of PBD was added to each vial. Amine was added by pipette for liquids or by mass for solids at desired ratios. Vials were stirred at 90°C for 48 hours. The spin bar was removed while the reaction material was still hot. Polymers were allowed to cool to room temperature before observing for color and viscosity as a rough monitor of reaction completeness. As the reactions went to completion, the viscosity dramatically increased and the mixtures turned more yellow/amber in color. Products were stored at 4°C. Primary amines were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, Mo.) and VWR International, LCC (West Chester, Pa.). PBDs were obtained from Sartomer Company, Inc. (Exton, Pa.) (Sartomer product #CN307) and San Esters (New York, NY) (product # BAC-15 and BAC-45). Example 1-1 The above polymer was synthesized following the procedure outlined above using 5.0 grams of polybutadiene diacrylate (99%) having a molecular weight of 3000Da (1 equivalent) and 325.11mg of N-(3-aminopropyl) diethanolamine (1.2 equivalents). The resulting material was characterized via 1H NMR. HNMR (CDCl3): δ (ppm) 1.0-1.3 (m), 1.3-1.5 (m), 1.6-1.7 (m), 1.8-2.2 (m), 2.4-2.5 (m), 2.5-2.7 (m), 2.7-2.8 (m), 3.6-3.7 (m), 4.8-5.1 (m), 5.2-5.4 (m), 5.4-5.7 (m). All NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300MHz spectrometer and taken in CDCl3. In like manner, Examples 1-2 through 1-11 below were formed from polybutadiene diacrylate polymer (molecular weight 1400Da or 3000Da) and suitable amines to form the β-amino ester compounds listed below.
