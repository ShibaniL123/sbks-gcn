The present application is a divisional application of co-pending application U.S. Ser. No. 13/995,368, having a 35 U.S.C. 371 (c) date of Nov. 27, 2013, which is a national stage application of International Application No. PCT/EP2011/073550, filed 21 Dec. 2011, which claims the benefit of Great Britain Application No. 1021584.6, filed 21 Dec. 2010, from which applications priority is claimed. The invention is concerned with organic compounds their preparation and use as intermediates in the synthesis of fragrance ingredients. Many fragrance ingredients that are used by perfumers in the creation of new and exciting fragrance accords are commodity ingredients, that is, they are non-proprietary and versions of the ingredients, which may differ in price and quality, and are available from many different suppliers. The uptake of a particular version of such ingredients by perfumers may be based on considerations of costs as well as on performance. 3a,6,6,9a-tetramethyldodecahydronaphtho[2,1-b]furan 2, from which certain isomers or isomer mixtures are on the market, for example Ambrofix® (Givaudan), Ambroxan® (Kao), Cetalox® and Fixambrene® (both Firmenich) is an example of such a commodity fragrance ingredient. There remains a need to provide novel key intermediates and novel syntheses that enable key fragrance ingredients to be produced in high purity, good yield and in a cost-effective manner. The invention provides in a first aspect a compound of formula 1 wherein, R is hydrogen, alkyl or substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl, more particularly R is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl. The double bond in the side chain of compound 1 may be in the α,β-position (conjugated), or in the β,γ-position (unconjugated). The applicant has found that compounds 1 are useful synthetic intermediates of fragrance ingredients such as 3a,6,6,9a-tetramethyldodecahydro-naphtho[2,1-b]furan 2, from which certain isomers or isomer mixtures are on the market, for example Ambrofix® (Givaudan), Ambroxan® (Kao), Cetalox® and Fixambrene® (both Firmenich). Syntheses of compound 2 are well known in the art. The transformation of conjugated malonates 3 (R=alkyl) to E configurated β,γ-unsaturated esters 4 is described in WO 2007096791 (Firmenich). Therein, said transformation is claimed to be catalyzed by salts of the formula MXn (with M being a metal of groups I, II and III, and X an anion of an acid HX) in stoichiometric amounts of an organic acid, as shown in the scheme below. The esters 4 are key intermediates in the synthesis of the important fragrance compound 2. However, α,β-unsaturated malonic acids, of which the compounds of formula 1 are examples, are generally considered as being less stable and more difficult to handle than the corresponding α,β-unsaturated malonates 3, e.g. during preparation, distillation, and/or under aqueous work-up conditions, which can make their preparation as well as further transformation to useful compounds troublesome. This might explain why the condensation of aldehyde 5 (see below for structure) with malonic acid has only produced acid 6 (for structure, see below) with poor E/Z (1:1) and α,β/β,γ ratios, (G. Lucius, Angew. Chem. 68, 247, 1956 or R. L. Snowdon, Siegfried Symposium, Universität Zürich, 2006). Progress in this field has been recently reported by Breit et al. (Chem. Eur. J. 16, 3423, 2010). However, the unsaturated malonic acids produced by his method lack the γ-substituent, which would give, after decarboxylation, E/Z isomers in case of β,γ-unsaturation (apart from a much different α,β/β,γ-selectivity). Furthermore, this so-called “decarboxylative Knoevenagel reaction” needs stoichiometric amounts of nitrogen-containing bases (especially when unsaturated acids are addressed). This makes the process uneconomic on a larger scale, as large quantities of the (often expensive) N-containing bases (such as pyridine, DMAP, Lutidine or DBU) have to be recovered from the waste-waters. Therefore, the findings that compound 1 is a useful intermediate for the preparation of valuable fragrance ingredients, and that it can be prepared economically is surprising. Accordingly, the invention provides in another of its aspects the use of a compound of the formula 1 in the preparation of an ester 4 or the acid 6, by the decarboxylation of the compound of formula 1. Starting from the compounds 1, the esters 4 can be prepared, which exhibit good β,γ/α,β and E/Z ratios, for example around 80:20 or higher, employing reagent systems used for the E-selective transformation of malonates 3 to esters 4 as described above. The good β,γ/α,β and E/Z ratios may be attributable to the free carboxylic acid group in compounds 1, which makes the overall reaction easier to achieve, because a transesterification step, required in WO 2007096791, is not necessary. In a particular embodiment of the invention, decarboxylation of compound 1, is carried out at ambient temperature, which may be about 0 to 130 degrees, e.g. at 25° C. for the purpose of this invention. The reaction may be carried out in a solvent, or in a solvent-free system. If solvents are to be employed, it is preferred that they are polar aprotic solvents, for example DMF, N-alkyl-pyrrolidinones or dialkylsulfoxides more particularly DMSO. The reaction may proceed stereospecifically and without erosion of the E/Z ratio. An example of this decarboxylation reaction is shown in the reaction scheme below wherein the compound 1a is decarboxylated in DMSO at ambient temperature, giving the corresponding methyl ester 4a. The ester 4a can be produced in this way stereospecifically and without erosion of the E/Z 72:28 ratio. In another particular embodiment of the decarboxylation of compounds of the formula 1, the reaction proceeds thermally, e.g. between 50 and 350° C. under flow conditions, e.g. on a Gas Chromatography (GC) column. GC uses a gaseous flow but other flow conditions are contemplated, e.g. the continuous decarboxylation of a compound of the formula 1 dissolved in a solvent or solvent-free in a coil reactor. Appropriate flow reactors are known to the chemist experienced in flow and analytical techniques (see for example Ley, S. V.; Baxendale, I. R. “New Tools for Molecule Makers: Emerging Technologies”, Proceedings of the Symposium “System Chemistry”, Bozen, Italy, Mai 26-30, 2008, Beilstein Institute), which is hereby incorporated by reference. A particular example of this reaction under flow conditions is shown in the reaction scheme below wherein the compound 1b (Z or E/Z 1:1) is converted to the ester of the formula 4a. The ester 4a can be produced in this manner with good E/Z ratios, for example around 80:20. In yet another particular embodiment of the decarboxylation of compounds of the formula 1, decarboxylation is carried out in the presence of a metal halide salt MXn (e.g. LiCl) in a polar aprotic solvent, e.g. N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP), to yield the corresponding deconjugated acid with high E/Z ratios. A particular example of this decarboxylation reaction is shown in the reaction scheme below, in which compound 1c is decarboxylated in the presence of a salt MXn (e.g. LiCl) in a polar aprotic solvent (e.g. NMP), giving deconjugated acid 6 with high E/Z ratios (e.g. 86:14). Therefore, the invention provides in another of its aspects, a process for the preparation of β,γ-unsaturated-γ,γ-disubstituted acids, e.g. the acid 6, said process comprising the step of reacting at a temperature of between about 50 to about 200, more particularly about 75 to about 125 degrees centigrade a conjugated malonic acid of the formula 1, e.g. the compound 1c with a salt MXc, optionally in the presence of a polar solvent, wherein MXn is an inorganic salt or an organic cation/halide anion pair, X is a halide and n is an integer of 1 to 3, and M is a group I, II or III metal when MXn is an inorganic salt, or M is selected from the group consisting of pyridinium, piperidinium, pyrrolidinium, imidazolium, ammonium, phophonium and sulphonium, when MXn is an organic cation/halide anion pair. MXn can be an ionic liquid, and in such cases it can act as both salt and a solvent. The reaction proceeds with good yield and with good E/Z selectivities up to 90:10 or even up to 95:5. The esters of formula 4, and the acid 6 are both important intermediates into the compound 2 and its isomers. Particularly interesting isomers of compound 2 can be achieved when the side chain double bonds of ester 4 or acid 6 are in the β,γ-position with E configuration. Methods for a 3-step transformation from an ester of formula 4 to Ambrox via bicyclic ester 7 are known in the art of fragrance chemistry, e.g. from WO 2006010287, which is hereby incorporated by reference. An example of this synthetic route is shown in the scheme below, wherein R is as hereinabove defined. The transformation consists of a series of cyclisation and reduction steps, proceeding with a first cyclisation step, a reduction step, and finally a second cyclisation step. The first and second cyclization steps proceed in the presence of an acid, as described more fully in WO2006010287, which is herein incorporated by reference. Examples of suitable cyclisation agents include mineral acids, organic acids and Lewis acids. Examples of suitable mineral acids include phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid and perchloric acids, heteropolyacids such as H3[P(W3O1O)4], acid resins such as Dowex™ 50 or Amberlyst™. Examples of suitable protonic acids include hydrohalide acids such as hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide. Examples of organic acids include acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulphonic acid and chlorosulphonic acid. These named acids are purely exemplary. It is also possible to use mixtures of the abovementioned acids. Non-restrictive examples of suitable Lewis acids include products such as AlCl3, TiCl4, SnCl4 and MeAlCl2. The cyclisation steps may be carried out in an inert organic solvent. The selection of a suitable solvent is well known within the skill of the art, but suitable examples include petroleum ether, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, dichloromethane and trichloroethane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and nitrobenzene, ethers such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, esters, nitrogen containing hydrocarbons such as nitromethane, nitropropane and acetonitrile. The reduction step b) may be carried out with a reducing agent. Any reducing agent that is capable performing the desired transformation may be used, and the skilled person will readily be able to identify a suitable reducing agent. Non-limiting examples of suitable reducing agents are hydride sources such as lithium aluminium hydride, sodium borohydride, Red-Al and silanes. The reduction is carried out in an inert solvent, the selection of which will be evident for a skilled person in the art. E-Cyclohomofarnesic acid 6 is (as is the case with esters 4) another valuable precursor of Ambrox 2. The cyclization of 6 to Sclareolide 8 and further processing of this key intermediate (8) to Ambrox 2 has been described in numerous articles and patents known to the person skilled in the art, and (as in the case of compounds 4) the double bond of 6 should be preferably in the β,γ-position with E-configuration to access Sclareolide 8 and the olfactorily interesting isomers of Ambrox 2 with good selectivity, for example about 90% or greater. These transformations can be performed substantially as described above in relation to esters 4, or according to methods described in EP 525579, EP 5500889, EP 165458 and DE 3240054, all of which citations are incorporated herein by reference. The compounds 1 can be formed in a quite straightforward fashion by the hydrolysis of the corresponding conjugated malonate 3. In an example of the synthesis of compounds of the formula 1, compound 1a (double bond in the β,γ-position and R=Me) is obtained from compound 3a, which is hydrolysed enzymatically using Pig Liver Esterase (PLE) as is shown in the reaction scheme below. In another example of the synthesis of compounds of the formula 1, compound 1b may be prepared by mono-hydrolysis of conjugated methyl malonate 3a in protic solvents, for example water and alcohols ROH or mixtures of both, with ROH including monoalcohols, diols and triols and R being any organic residue, which may be branched or unbranched, e.g. methyl or ethyl, and in the presence of a base, such as hydroxides of alkali and/or earth alkali or group III metals. For example conjugated Meldrum's acid 3b is treated with KOH in methanol (see the reaction scheme below) to give half-malonate 1b: In yet another example of the synthesis of a compound of the formula 1, compound 1c can be prepared by condensation of aldehyde 5 with malonic acid. This transformation can be carried out with organocatalysts or ionic liquids or mixtures of both, used in catalytic or stoichiometric amounts, but catalytic amounts are preferred. The term organocatalyst is well known in the art. Preferred organocatalysts according to the invention comprise an amino and an acid function. These functions can be linked covalently in the same molecule, such as in proline and other amino acids, or such as in glycylglycine (H-Gly-Gly-OH, 2-(2-aminoacetamido)acetic acid) and other peptides. The amine component and the acid component can be mixed before or during the condensation reaction to form an ammonium carboxylate salt. In these salts the carboxylate is derived from carboxylic or polycarboxylic acids such as acetic acid, malonic acid or citric acid. The amine component is derived from ammonia, a primary, a secondary amine or a polyamine. Secondary amines are preferred, e.g. piperidine, piperazine, pyrrolidine and morpholine. The organocatalysts are used in a solvent or solvent systems which form azeotropes with water such as cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, iso-propanol or tent-butanol. Azeotropes with boiling points of around 70-90° C. are preferred as condensation reactions using such azeotropes proceed and water is removed without uncontrolled decarboxylation of malonic acid or condensation product 1c. Under these conditions relatively low amounts of 1-1.2 equiv of malonic acid are sufficient for complete conversion of aldehyde 5 to acid 1c. In yet another example of the synthesis of a compound 1, compound 1c can be prepared by hydrolysis of conjugated malonate 3 with inorganic base in water and in the presence of phase transfer catalysts (PTC) such as 18-crown-6 or tetraethylammonium chloride (TEBAC) under reflux. The starting materials 3a, 3b and 5 are all commonly available reagents or can be derived from commonly available starting materials according to methods well known in the art. A more detailed discussion of the starting materials and syntheses is set out in the Examples, below. It has also been found, that it is not necessary to work-up and isolate compound 1c after condensation of malonic acid with aldehyde 5, because the compound 1c can be decarboxylated in-situ to cyclohomofarnesic acid 6 giving the same good yield and E/Z ratio as from isolated 1c. An example of this in-situ reaction is shown in the reaction scheme below: Said process represents a significant advantage over previous syntheses of E-Cyclohomofarnesic acid 6, as it allows its efficient one-pot preparation from aldehyde 5 with good yield and purity, using relatively low amounts of inexpensive catalysts, reagents and solvents, which can be recycled. The invention is further described with reference to the following examples.
