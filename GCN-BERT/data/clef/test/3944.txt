The third step
To a solution of Compound 37 (30.0mg, 0.050mmol) in acetonitrile (1 mL) was added 1-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-1,4-diazoniabicyclo [2,2,2] octane bis (tetrafluoroborate) (selectfluor (R), 26.3mg, 0.074mmol) under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes under ice-cooling. The reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform after addition of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield compound 38 (11.6 mg, yield 38%).
