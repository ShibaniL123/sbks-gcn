More specifically, the present invention relates to a heat dissipation paint composition capable of forming a heat dissipation layer having excellent salt water resistance, coating film strength, adherence property, scratch resistance, or the like, together with excellent heat dissipation property, in various products, and a heat dissipation structure. BACKGROUND ART Recently, as a light emitting diode (LED) head lamp is increasingly applied to an automobile, or the like, a technical effort to decrease a temperature of the lamp has been conducted. In particular, an LED device is a semiconductor device which is significantly sensitive to a temperature, and problems such as decrease in lifespan and malfunction by an increase in a temperature during operation may occur seriously. Therefore, it is significantly required to suppress the increase in a temperature of the LED head lamp, and the like, to extend the lifespan, and to suppress malfunction. Up to now, in order to suppress the increase in the temperature of the LED head lamp, and the like, heat dissipation property is realized through a fan between the lamp and a bracket in most cases. However, in the heat dissipation structure, the fan has a shorter lifespan than that of the lamp, and noise, dust, and frequent failure occur, such that the high-priced LED head lamp needs to be frequently replaced. Accordingly, development in technology of extending the lifespan of the lamp by appropriately radiating heat generated around the LED head lamp, and the like, to suppress the increase in the temperature without using a mechanical structure such as a fan, or the like, has been continuously demanded. Recently, in order to obtain the above-described effect, an effort of forming a heat dissipation structure such as a heat dissipation layer, or the like, by using a heat dissipation paint composition around the LED head lamp, and the like, has been attempted. However, the heat dissipation paint composition capable of forming the heat dissipation layer having excellent salt water resistance, coating film strength, adherence property, scratch resistance, or the like, together with excellent heat dissipation property so as to preferably realize the effect, has not been achieved properly yet. SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problem The present invention has been made in an effort to provide a heat dissipation paint composition capable of forming a heat dissipation layer having excellent salt water resistance, coating film strength, adherence property, scratch resistance, or the like, together with excellent heat dissipation property, in various products such as a light emitting diode (LED) head lamp, and the like. The present invention has also been made in an effort to provide a heat dissipation structure such as a heat dissipation layer, or the like, having excellent salt water resistance, coating film strength, adherence property, scratch resistance, or the like, together with excellent heat dissipation property, obtained from the heat dissipation paint composition. Solution to Problem An exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a heat dissipation paint composition including: an epoxy resin; a curing agent; a carbon-based filler having a functional group including at least one selected from the group consisting of an amine group, an amide group, a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group bound thereto; and a solvent. Another embodiment of the present invention provides a heat dissipation structure including: an epoxy resin cured material having a cross-linked structure by a ring-opened epoxy group; and a carbon-based filler having a functional group including at least one selected from the group consisting of an amine group, an amide group, a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group bound thereto. Hereinafter, the heat dissipation paint composition and the heat dissipation structure according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the heat dissipation paint composition including: an epoxy resin; a curing agent; a carbon-based filler having a functional group including at least one selected from the group consisting of an amine group, an amide group, a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group bound thereto; and a solvent is provided. The heat dissipation paint composition may include the epoxy resin having at least one epoxy group at an end thereof, or the like; the curing agent; and the carbon-based filler having a specific functional group bound onto a surface, the specific functional group being capable of forming a hydrogen bond. If the heat dissipation paint composition is applied around products requiring heat radiation, such as an LED head lamp, and the like, and then is cured, the epoxy group in the epoxy resin may be ring-opened and interact with the curing agent to thereby form a cross-linked structure of the epoxy groups as shown in Reaction Formula 1 below. Therefore, the epoxy resin cured material and the heat dissipation structure such as the heat dissipation layer including the same, may be provided. In particular, in the epoxy resin cured material having the heat dissipation structure, the carbon-based filler having the specific functional group bound onto the surface may be uniformly dispersed, and it may be considered that a hydrogen bond may be formed between the specific functional group of the carbon-based filler and oxygen derived from the epoxy group and included in a cross-linked structure. A chemical bonding structure in which the hydrogen bonds are formed is schematically represented by Reaction Formula 2 below: Due to the interaction between the carbon-based filler and the epoxy resin such as the formation of hydrogen bonds, in the heat dissipation structure such as the heat dissipation layer, or the like, the carbon-based filler may show more excellent compatibility with the epoxy resin and cured materials thereof, and may be more uniformly dispersed in the heat dissipation structure to provide excellent and uniform effects. As a result, the heat dissipation structure obtained from the heat dissipation paint composition according to an exemplary embodiment may exhibit more excellent effects due to the carbon-based filler which is material having thermal conductivity and heat dissipation property to provide excellent heat dissipation property, and the heat dissipation structure such as the heat dissipation layer, or the like, may show improved general physical properties such as excellent salt water resistance, coating film strength, adherence property on a substrate, scratch resistance, hardness, and the like, due to excellent compatibility, and the like, between the epoxy resin and the carbon-based filler. Therefore, by using the heat dissipation paint composition according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, heat generated from the light emitting diode (LED) head lamp effectively radiates without disposing mechanical heat dissipation structures such as a fan, and the like, around the LED head lamp, such that an increase in temperature may be suppressed, and as a result, the LED head lamp may have an improved lifespan.
