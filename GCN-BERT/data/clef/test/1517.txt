Field of the invention The present invention relates to polypropylene compositions, which are characterized by improved additive retention, as well as to articles comprising such polypropylene compositions. The present invention is particularly useful for articles requiring specific surface properties over an extended period of time. The technical problem and the prior art The vast majority of commercial polypropylene is either homopolymer of propylene or copolymer of propylene with other olefins, generally with other alpha-olefins. The nature of the monomers leads to polymers essentially consisting of carbon and hydrogen only, thus also resulting in specific properties of the polymers, such as for example a hydrophobic surface or chemical inertness to a wide range of chemicals. Depending upon the final use of the polypropylene, its inherent properties may be more or less desired. In consequence, polymer producers and converters try to change the properties by the addition of additives into the polypropylene. Some of these additives, particularly the ones which are intended to modify the surface properties, are migrating additives, which after having been added into the polypropylene over time migrate to the surface. A particular example of such additives are antistatic agents. Antistatic agents generally comprise a hydrophobic (non-polar) part and a hydrophilic (polar) part. After their incorporation into the polypropylene, antistatic agents need to migrate to the surface of the polypropylene in order to become effective, i.e. to render the hydrophobic surface of the polypropylene more hydrophilic and in consequence for example less susceptible to dust accumulation on the surface. This is of particular interest for durable goods, such as transport boxes and crates or garden furniture or toys to name only a few. For durable goods to keep their appearance over an extended period of time it is normally necessary to incorporate high levels of antistatic agents. By doing so the time before the "reservoir" of antistatic agent in the polypropylene is depleted is increased. However, high levels of antistatic agent in the polypropylene frequently lead to blooming, i.e. too much antistatic agent gathers on the polypropylene's surface and results in a matte ("non-glossy") appearance. The present invention is therefore concerned with providing a polypropylene composition that does not have these disadvantages. Hence, it is an object of the present invention to provide a polypropylene composition having good gloss despite the presence of migrating additives in said polypropylene composition. Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a polypropylene composition wherein the level of additive can be reduced while still giving the same effect or wherein the same level leads to an increased life time of the article comprising said polypropylene composition. Additionally, it is an object of the present invention to provide an article having these characteristics. Brief description of the invention Any of these objectives can be attained either individually or in any combination by the following polypropylene composition wherein the polypropylene has been produced with a metallocene-based polymerization catalyst. In consequence, the present application discloses a polypropylene composition comprising (i) x wt% of component (A), said component (A) being a polypropylene produced with a metallocene-based polymerization catalyst, wherein x is at least 50;(ii) y wt% of component (B), said component (B) being an additive that migrates to the surface of said polypropylene composition, wherein y is at least 0.001 and at most 2.0; and(iii) (100 - x - y) wt% of component (C), said component (C) being one or more thermoplastic polymers different from component (A), with the provision that x + y ≤ 100, and with wt% relative to the total weight of said polypropylene composition, wherein said polypropylene composition has a gloss at 20° of at least 75, determined on 1 mm thick plaques having been produced by injection molding and stored at 40°C ± 1°C for three days before measuring gloss at 20° in accordance with ASTM D 2457.. The present application also discloses articles consisting of said polypropylene composition and a process for the production of an article having improved additive retention, said process comprising the steps of (a) providing a polypropylene composition as defined above; and(b) transforming said polypropylene composition into an article by a process selected from the group consisting of injection molding, extrusion blow molding, extrusion-thermoforming, sheet extrusion, film extrusion, pipe extrusion, and injection stretch-blow molding. Additionally, the present application discloses the use of a polypropylene composition according to claim 1 to reduce the migration rate of said component (B), characterized in that the difference in gloss of the 1 mm thick injection molded plaques measured three days following injection molding and 25 days following injection is at most 70 % of the difference in gloss of the 1 mm thick injection molded plaques stored at 40°C ± 1°C measured three days following injection molding and 25 days following injection molding for the same polypropylene composition wherein for component (A) the polypropylene produced with a polymerization catalyst comprising a metallocene was substituted with a polypropylene produced with a Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalyst. Brief description of the drawing Figure 1 shows the evolution of gloss at 20° with time obtained for compositions comprising a metallocene polypropylene as well as for comparative compositions comprising a Ziegler-Natta polypropylene. Figure 2 shows the migration, in the mold, of the additive in a metallocene polypropylene as well as for comparative composition comprising a Ziegler-Natta polypropylene.

More preferably, Rb and Rc may both be the same and may be selected from the group consisting of substituted cyclopentadienyl, unsubstituted indenyl, substituted indenyl, unsubstituted tetrahydroindenyl and substituted tetrahydroindenyl. By "unsubstituted" is meant that all positions on Rb resp. Rc, except for the one to which the bridge is attached, are occupied by hydrogen. By "substituted" is meant that, in addition to the position at which the bridge is attached, at least one other position on Rb resp.

Said bulky substituent may for example be -CR27R28R29 or -SiR27R28R29 with R27, R28 and R29 independently selected from group consisting of C1-C10 alkyl, C5-C7 cycloalkyl, C6-C15 aryl, and alkylaryl with C1-C10 alkyl and C6-C15 aryl, or any two neighboring R may form a cyclic saturated or non-saturated C4-C10 ring. it is preferred that R27, R28 and R29 are methyl. Examples of particularly suitable metallocenes are: dimethylsilanediyl-bis(2-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(3-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(3-tert-butyl-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(3-tert-butyl-5-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(2,4-dimethyl-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(2-methyl-indenyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(3-methyl-indenyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(3-tert-butyl-indenyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(4,7-dimethyl-indenyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(benzindenyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(3,3'-2-methyl-benzindenyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(4-phenyl-indenyl)zirconium dichloride,dimethylsilanediyl-bis(2-methyl-4-phenyl-indenyl)zirconium dichloride,ethanediyl-bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride,ethanediyl -bis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride,isopropylidene-(3-tert-butyl-cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl) zirconium dichlorideisopropylidene-(3-tert-butyl-5-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl) zirconium dichloride. The metallocene may be supported according to any method known in the art. In the event it is supported, the support used in the present invention can be any organic or inorganic solid, particularly porous supports such as talc, inorganic oxides, and resinous support material such as polyolefin. Preferably, the support material is an inorganic oxide in its finely divided form. The metallocene polypropylene used herein is produced by polymerizing propylene and at least one comonomer in presence of a metallocene-based polymerization catalyst to obtain the metallocene polypropylene. Preferably, the metallocene polypropylene used herein is a metallocene polypropylene homopolymer produced by polymerizing propylene in presence of a metallocene-based polymerization catalyst. The polymerization in presence of a metallocene-based polymerization catalyst can be carried out according to known techniques in one or more polymerization reactors at temperatures in the range from 20°C to 150°C. The metallocene polypropylene used herein is preferably produced by polymerization in liquid propylene at temperatures in the range from 20°C to 120°C. More preferred temperatures are in the range from 60°C to 100°C. The pressure can be atmospheric or higher. It is preferably between 25 and 50 bar. The molecular weight of the polymer chains, and in consequence the melt flow of the resulting metallocene polypropylene, may be controlled by the addition of hydrogen to the polymerization medium. Preferably, the metallocene polypropylene is recovered from the one or more polymerization reactors without post-reactor treatment, such as thermal or chemical degradation (e.g. by using peroxides), to reduce its molecular weight and/or narrow the molecular weight distribution, as is often done for polypropylene produced with a Ziegler-Natta catalyst. An example for chemical degradation is visbreaking, wherein the polypropylene is reacted for example with an organic peroxide at elevated temperatures, for example in an extruder or pelletizing equipment. The metallocene polypropylene may also comprise one or more antioxidants, one or more acid scavengers, one or more light stabilizers, one or more nucleating agents and any blend of these. The additives comprised in said metallocene polypropylene are non-migrating additives. A general overview of such additives is given in Plastics Additives Handbook, ed. H. Zweifel, 5th edition, 2001, Hanser Publishers. - COMPONENT (B) Component (B) is an additive that migrates, or in other words, has the tendency to migrate, to the surface of the present polypropylene composition, or rather to the surface of an article consisting of said polypropylene composition. For a general overview of additives it is referred to the already mentioned Plastics Additives Handbook, ed. H. Zweifel, 5th edition, 2001, Hanser Publishers. Preferably, component (B) is selected from the group consisting of antioxidants, acid scavengers, light stabilizers, lubricants, nucleating agents, antistatic agents and any blend of these. Most preferably, component (B) is an antistatic agent of a blend of more than one antistatic agents. Suitable antistatic agents for use in the present polypropylene composition can be selected from any of the antistatic agents known to the skilled person. It is, however, preferred that the antistatic agent be selected from the group consisting of fatty acid esters, ethoxylated alkylamines, diethanolamides, ethoxylated alcohols, and blends thereof. Examples of fatty acid esters are esters of fatty acids with general formula CmH2m+1COOH, wherein CmH2m+1 is a, preferably linear, hydrocarbyl group (alkyl group) with m ranging from 1 to 35, preferably from 5 to 30, even more preferably from 10 to 25, and most preferably from 15 to 20. The most preferred fatty acid esters are glycerol monostearate, glycerol distearate and glycerol tristearate. Examples of ethoxylated amines are those of general formula CmH2m+1N(CH2-CH2-OH)2, wherein CmH2m+1 is an alkyl group with m ranging from 1 to 30. Examples of diethanolamides are those of general formula CmH2m+1-C(O)-N(CH2-CH2-OH)2, wherein CmH2m+1 is an alkyl group with m ranging from 1 to 30, preferably from 5 to 25 and most preferably from 10 to 20. Examples of ethoxylated alcohols are those of general formula H-(O-CH2-CH2)n-CmH2m+1, wherein CmH2m+1 is an alkyl group with m ranging from 1 to 30, preferably from 5 to 25 and most preferably from 10 to 20, and n is preferably from 1 to 15. The antistatic agent or the blend of more that one antistatic agents are preferably comprised in the metallocene polypropylene in an amount of at least 100 ppm, more preferably of at least 250 ppm, even more preferably of at least 500 ppm, even more preferably of at least 750 ppm, still even more preferably of at least 1000 ppm, and most preferably of at least 1250 ppm. The one or more antistatic agents are preferably comprised in the metallocene polypropylene in an amount of at most 20,000 ppm or 15,000 ppm or 10,000 ppm, more preferably of at most 9,000 ppm or 8,000 ppm, even more preferably of at most 7,000 ppm or 6,000 ppm and most preferably of at most 5,000 ppm. The content of antistatic agent is given in weight relative to the total weight of the metallocene polypropylene. - COMPONENT (C) Component (C) is a thermoplastic polymer or a blend of at least two thermoplastic polymers, with the provision that such thermoplastic polymer is different from component (A). The one or more thermoplastic polymer can be selected from the group consisting of propylene homopolymers, random copolymers of propylene and at least one comonomer with the comonomer as defined above, heterophasic copolymers of propylene and at least one comonomer, ethylene homopolymers, copolymers of ethylene and at least one comonomer with the comonomer as defined above, under the provision that the one or more thermoplastic polymers is different from component (A). By "different from component (A)" is meant that the thermoplastic polymer differs in at least one property from the metallocene polypropylene as defined above. Said property may for example be the respective composition, such as that the thermoplastic polymer has different comonomer(s), or the comonomer content; be produced with a different polymerization catalyst, such as for example a Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalyst; or a different melt flow index; or have a different tacticity, i.e. a different content of mmmm pentads and be for example a syndiotactic polypropylene. The thermoplastic polymer is preferably not a metallocene polypropylene homopolymer. The thermoplastic polymer is preferred to have a melt flow index as defined above for the metallocene polypropylene. The present polypropylene composition are used to produce articles by a transformation process selected from the group consisting of injection molding, extrusion blow molding, extrusion-thermoforming, sheet extrusion, film extrusion, pipe extrusion, and injection stretch-blow molding. Injection molding is, however, preferred. Hence, the present application also discloses a process, wherein a polypropylene composition as defined above is provided and transformed into an articles by a process selected from one of said transformation processes. The present polypropylene composition may be used for household articles, storage boxes, crates, toys, caps and closures, packaging articles, cups, garden furniture, pipe, films, sheet, corrugated sheet, panels etc. It has now very surprisingly been found that articles produced with the present polypropylene composition are characterized by improved additive retention, particularly as such effect is not observed with polypropylene compositions wherein the metallocene polypropylene is replaced by a polypropylene produced with a Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalyst. The finding is even more surprising as, in the mold, no relevant difference was observed between the migrations of the additive in the present polypropylene composition and in a polypropylene produced with a Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalyst (Fig. 2). "Improved additive retention" can imply that additives, the migration of which to the surface of the article is not desired, are better retained within the polypropylene, and in consequence do not - or in reduced extent - lead to undesired effects. Alternatively, "improved additive retention" can also imply that additives, the migration of which to the surface of the article is desired, are released over an extended period of time. Such an effect is particularly desirable for example with antistatic agents. On the one hand it is desired that they accumulate on the surface in a concentration such that the desired effect, for example avoidance of dust build-up, is attained. On the other hand, the concentration should not be so high that blooming occurs. "Blooming" denotes the effect that too much antistatic agent arrives at the surface and gives the surface a matte and splotchy ("non-glossy") look. Hence, the present application also relates to the use of a polypropylene composition as defined above to reduce the migration rate of component (B) as defined above, characterized in that the difference in gloss of the 1 mm thick injection molded plaques measured three days following injection molding and 25 days following injection is at most 70 % of the difference in gloss of the 1 mm thick injection molded plaques stored at 401°C ± 1°C measured three days following injection molding and 25 days following injection molding for the same polypropylene composition wherein for component (A) the polypropylene produced with a polymerization catalyst comprising a metallocene was substituted with a polypropylene produced with a Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalyst. Test methods Melt flow index (MFI) is determined according to ISO 1133, condition L, at 230°C and 2.16 kg. Gloss is measured in accordance with ASTM D 2457 at an angle of 20°. Molecular weights are determined by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) at high temperature (145°C). A 10 mg polypropylene sample is dissolved at 160°C in 10 ml of trichlorobenzene (technical grade) for 1 hour. Analytical conditions for the GPCV 2000 from WATERS are : Injection volume: +/- 400 µlAutomatic sample preparation and injector temperature: 160°CColumn temperature: 145°CDetector temperature: 160°CColumn set : 2 Shodex AT-806MS and 1 Styragel HT6EFlow rate: 1 ml/minDetector: Infrared detector (2800-3000 cm-1)Calibration: Narrow standards of polystyrene (commercially available)Calculation for polypropylene: Based on Mark-Houwink relation (log10(MPP) = log10(MPS) - 0.25323); cut-off on the low molecular weight end at MPP = 1000. The molecular weight distribution (MWD) is then calculated as Mw/Mn. Xylene solubles (XS), i.e. the xylene soluble fraction, are determined as follows: Between 4.5 and 5.5 g of propylene polymer are weighed into a flask and 300 ml xylene are added. The xylene is heated under stirring to reflux for 45 minutes. Stirring is continued for 15 minutes without heating. The flask is then placed in a thermostat bath set to 25°C +/- 1°C for 1 hour. The solution is filtered through Whatman n° 4 filter paper and 100 ml of solvent are collected. The solvent is then evaporated and the residue dried and weighed. The percentage of xylene solubles ("XS"), i.e. the amount of the xylene soluble fraction, is then calculated according to XSin wt%=Weight of the residue/Initial total weight of PP*300 with all weights being in the same unit, such as for example in grams. The 13C-NMR analysis is performed using a 400 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer under conditions such that the signal intensity in the spectrum is directly proportional to the total number of contributing carbon atoms in the sample. Such conditions are well known to the skilled person and include for example sufficient relaxation time etc. In practice the intensity of a signal is obtained from its integral, i.e. the corresponding area. The data is acquired using proton decoupling, 4000 scans per spectrum, a pulse repetition delay of 20 seconds and a spectral width of 26000 Hz. The sample is prepared by dissolving a sufficient amount of polymer in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB, 99%, spectroscopic grade) at 130°C and occasional agitation to homogenize the sample, followed by the addition of hexadeuterobenzene (C6D6, spectroscopic grade) and a minor amount of hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS, 99.5+ %), with HMDS serving as internal standard. To give an example, about 200 mg of polymer are dissolved in 2.0 ml of TCB, followed by addition of 0.5 ml of C6D6 and 2 to 3 drops of HMDS. Following data acquisition the chemical shifts are referenced to the signal of the internal standard HMDS, which is assigned a value of 2.03 ppm. The isotacticity is determined by 13C-NMR analysis on the total polymer. In the spectral region of the methyl groups the signals corresponding to the pentads mmmm, mmmr, mmrr and mrrm are assigned using published data, for example A. Razavi, Macromol. Symp., vol. 89, pages 345-367. Only the pentads mmmm, mmmr, mmrr and mrrm are taken into consideration due to the weak intensity of the signals corresponding to the remaining pentads. For the signal relating to the mmrr pentad a correction is performed for its overlap with a methyl signal related to 2,1-insertions. The percentage of mmmm pentads is then calculated according to %mmmm=AREAmmmm/AREAmmmm+AREAmmmr+AERAmmrr+AREAmrrm•100 Determination of the percentage of 2,1-insertions for a metallocene propylene homopolymer: The signals corresponding to the 2,1-insertions are identified with the aid of published data, for example H.N. Cheng, J. Ewen, Makromol. Chem., vol. 190 (1989), pages 1931-1940. A first area, AREA1, is defined as the average area of the signals corresponding to 2,1-insertions. A second area, AREA2, is defined as the average area of the signals corresponding to 1,2-insertions. The assignment of the signals relating to the 1,2-insertions is well known to the skilled person and need not be explained further. The percentage of 2,1-insertions is calculated according to 2,1-insertionsin%=AREA⁢1/AREA⁢1+AREA⁢2•100 with the percentage in 2,1-insertions being given as the molar percentage of 2,1-inserted propylene with respect to total propylene. The determination of the percentage of 2,1-insertions for a metallocene random copolymer of propylene and ethylene is determined by two contributions: (i) the percentage of 2,1-insertions as defined above for the propylene homopolymer, and(ii) the percentage of 2,1-insertions, wherein the 2,1-inserted propylene neighbors an ethylene, thus the total percentage of 2,1-insertions corresponds to the sum of these two contributions. The assignments of the signal for case (ii) can be done either by using reference spectra or by referring to the published literature. Examples The advantages of the present invention are illustrated using the polypropylene compositions as indicated in Table 1. Table 1Component (A) [wt%]Component (A) [wt%]Component (B) [wt%]TypePP1PP2GMS90Example 199.9000.100Example 299.8250.175Comparative example 199.9000.100Comparative example 22 99.82599.8250.175 PP1 is a polypropylene produced with a metallocene-based polymerization catalysts, wherein the metallocene is a supported bridged (bis-disubstituted-indenyl) zirconocene. PP1 is a C3-C2 copolymer having a melt flow index of 110 dg/min and an ethylene content of 2 wt%. PP2 is a polypropylene produced with a Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalyst. PP2 is a C3-C2 copolymer having a melt flow index of 80 dg/min, and an ethylene content of 3.5 wt%. GMS90 is a commercially available antistatic agent with a content of glycol monostearate of 90 wt%. Blooming, or migration of the antistatic agent to the surface of an article consisting of the polypropylene compositions of Examples 1 and 2 as well as Comparative Examples 1 and 2 was checked using gloss at 20° as an indicator. Gloss was determined on 1 mm thick plaques, which were injection molded on a 60 ton Netstal injection molding machine with a barrel temperature of 230°C. The results of the gloss measurements are shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the migration, in the mold of the antistatic agent GMS90 in a Ziegler Natta polypropylene and in a metallocene polypropylene. In the mold, no relevant difference was observed between the migration of the GMS90. However, in the longer term, significant differences were observed as GMS 90 is migrating much faster in the Ziegler Natta polypropylene than in the metallocene polypropylene (Figure 1).
