Step 5: 2-(((tert-Butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-5,8-dichloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
To a stirred solution of (E)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-((2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino)-1-(2,4,5-trichloropyridin-3-yl)but-2-en-1-one (6.37 g, 11.78 mmol) in DMF (47 ml) was added potassium carbonate (8.14 g, 58.9 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 80Â° C. for 3 hrs. The reaction mixture was poured in ice cold water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layers were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude compound was purified by silica gel column chromatography (10-100% EtOAc in heptane) to afford the desired compound (4.6 g, 77% yield).
