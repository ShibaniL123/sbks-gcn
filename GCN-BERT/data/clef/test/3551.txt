CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This non-provisional application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/949,095, entitled “DEVICE FOR DISPENSING DEODORANT AND LIQUID SCENTS,” filed Mar. 6, 2014. The identified provisional application is incorporated herein by specific reference. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISC Not Applicable. TECHNICAL FIELD The disclosed embodiments relate to the field of packaging, and more specifically to the field of packaging cosmetic products. BACKGROUND The present invention relates to cosmetic products and more specifically to the packaging of cosmetic products. Substances such as deodorants and antiperspirants can be applied to the body to reduce body odor caused by perspiration. There are many well known forms of deodorant including a deodorant stick, roll-on, gel, foam and aerosol spray which may be secured in a container. These types of deodorants may be applied to the body such as to the underarm or armpit. However, the deodorant stick may be applied to other parts of the body as well to reduce body odor and possibly to reduce perspiration in the case of an antiperspirant. Additionally, colloids, such as creams, lotions, balms, sun blocks, etc. are well known and can be applied to different parts of the body for cosmetic and health purposes. Manual liquid, sanitizer, perfume and cologne dispensers of various sorts have been widely implemented in a variety of applications. One type of liquid dispenser is a manually operated pump that is arranged to dispense a liquid, cologne, sanitizer or perfume in a fine mist. A common application for such liquid spray dispensers is well known and used in the dispensing of fragrance. The current commercial practice is to manufacturer cosmetics, such as deodorants, perfumes, colognes, lotions, suntan lotion, creams etc., and then to package such items in individual packaging. When a person or individual desires to purchase both deodorant and perfume or cologne, then that person will typically purchase two separate items. The first packaging would contain a perfume or cologne and the second packaging would contain the deodorant. This requires a person to make two purchases. Because of the necessity of making two separate purchases, there is a risk that the retailer will run out of stock of one of the products. Additionally, when making two purchases, a consumer or buyer may have difficulty in finding the two separate packages. Furthermore, when traveling, a person is required to store two separate bottles. One for housing perfume or cologne and the other for housing deodorant. Because of the increased amount of space, a consumer or buyer has a reduced amount of space to store other items. Furthermore, because of the increased amount of space utilized for storing two separate packages or containers, a consumer or buyer is not able to easily carry both perfume or colognes and deodorants on their person, such as inside a coat pocket, pants pocket or backpack. Therefore there exists a need for improvements over the prior art. SUMMARY In one embodiment, a device for dispensing a substance and a liquid is disclosed.

FIGS. 3A and 3B provide a more detailed view of the container 110, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3A is a top view of the container, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3B is a cross-sectional side view taken along line C illustrated in FIG. 3A. Referring to FIGS. 3A and 3B, the container has a top end 205 opposing a bottom end 206 and a side wall 301 spanning from the top end to the bottom end and a bottom wall 305 at the bottom end. The shape of the container defines a compartment 215 adapted to receive a substance. The substance can be a solid, such as a deodorant, or it may also be a colloid, such as a cream, lotion, suntan lotion etc. The side wall of the container may include an upper portion 140 having an outside cross-sectional diameter slightly less than an outside cross-sectional diameter of a lower portion 147 defining a shoulder 145. The shoulder is adapted to form a stop or ledge upon which the bottom end of the cap 120 may sit when the cap is received by the container. The bottom end 206 of the container defines a recess 330. The bottom end of the container is adapted to house the lead-screw 225 and knob 240. The recess 330 is adapted such that its cross-sectional diameter is slightly larger than the cross-sectional outside diameter of the knob so that the recess may receive the knob. Within the recess of the bottom wall is an array of cantilevers 335 defining a ring feature 340 surrounding an opening 345. The ring feature defined by the array of cantilevers is adapted to secure the lead-screw and to allow the lead-screw to rotate within the compartment without translating (more fully explained below). FIG. 4A is a top view of the container having a deodorant therein, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 4B is a cross-sectional side view taken along line C illustrated in FIG. 4A, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate the stick of deodorant held within the compartment 215 and resting on top of the lift body 220. The first end of the lead-screw is attached to the knob 270. The lead screw and knob are positioned in the recess 330 of the bottom end of the container 110 such that the lead-screw is centrally positioned in the compartment 215. The lead-screw is sized such that it can fit within a channel 405 having a tubular shape within the stick of deodorant. The un-threaded portion 271 of the lead-screw is held into place by the ring feature 340 defined by the plurality of cantilevers 235 and is prevented from being removed from the compartment within the container by the ridge 275 that separates the threaded portion of the lead-screw from the un-threaded threaded portion of the lead-screw.

The mouth has an inner section 930 that is proximate to the rear of the mouth and an outer section 935 that is proximate to the opening of the mouth 940. In the present embodiment, the inner section of the mouth has a cross-sectional diameter slightly smaller than the cross-sectional diameter of the outer section such that a shoulder 945 is defined. The cross-sectional diameter of the outer section is sized so that when the upper portion of the container is inserted into the mouth, the shoulder of the cap may stop the sidewall 301 of the container. The inner section of the mouth is sized to allow a portion of a deodorant or other solid to be received by the inner section of the mouth when such deodorant extends beyond the sidewall of the container. As shown in FIG. 9, in the present embodiment the body of the cap further includes a cavity perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the mouth. In the present embodiment, the shape of the cavity is adapted to receive and hold the fully assembled spray bottle assembly 605. In the present embodiment, the fully assembled spray bottle assembly is inserted into the cavity such that the longitudinal axis of the spray bottle is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the cap. In other embodiments (not shown), the fully assembled spray bottle assembly may be designed such that when inserted into the cavity the longitudinal axis of the spray bottle is coaxial with the longitudinal axis of the cap. The cavity is defined by an opening 950 along a portion of the side 955 of the cap, cavity side walls 956, back wall 957 and bottom wall 958. Proximate to the opening of the cavity of the cap along the cavity wall is an orifice 960. In the present embodiment, the orifice is a rectangular shape. However, other shapes may be used. The orifice has as a rear wall 965 proximate to the opening of the cavity. The cap also includes a spray opening 255 that provides access between the outside and inside of the cavity of the cap and sized to allow fluid to exit the cap. In the present embodiment, the spray opening is circular in shape, however other shapes may also be used. FIG. 10A is a bottom view of the cap having the fully assembled spray bottle assembly inserted therein, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 10B is a cross-sectional side view along line 10B of FIG. 10A, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 10A, illustrates the outside of the bottom wall 958 of the cavity. Also illustrated is the orifice 960 having a rear wall 965. As shown in FIG. 10A, when the fully assembled spray bottle assembly has been inserted into the cavity, the rear end of the wedge 850 of the tongue abuts the rear wall of the orifice preventing the fully assembled bottle assembly from being removed. To remove the spray bottle, forces acting toward the inside of the box shaped member along the wedge 850 of the tongue must move the tongue inward such that the wedge clears the rear wall 965 of the orifice 960. When the wedge clears the rear wall, the box-shaped member can be removed as well as the other components of the spray bottle assembly. After the spray bottle assembly is removed, the spray bottle can be replaced or refilled depending of the type of bottle used. FIG. 10A also illustrates the fully assembled spray bottle assembly inserted into the cavity of the cap in an un-pressed position. In this position, the bottom end 815 of the box shaped member is substantially flush with the opening 950 of the cavity of the cap. As mentioned above, the spray bottle used can be one well known to those skilled in the art. The spray bottle includes a vaporizing mechanism, sprayer, or atomizer that is adapted to face the spray opening 255 of the spray bottle. However, other means by which the liquid inside of the bottle can be moved to outside of the bottle may be used. In one embodiment, the mechanism for dispensing liquid can be a pump that is adapted to take a liquid from inside the bottle to outside of the bottle. The vaporizing mechanism comprises an elongated tube 1025 that is placed inside the spray bottle so that an opening 1030 through which liquid is drawn is proximate to the bottom or lower end of inside the spray bottle. The vaporizing mechanism further includes a check valve (not shown) that is a one-way valve having a hollow stem 1020, wherein the check valve is adapted to allow fluid to pass through the stem when the stem is forced inward or towards the bottom end of the spray bottle. The stem can be forced downward when forces acting along the longitudinal axis of the bottle towards the bottom or lower end of the bottle are applied thereto. Without such forces acting along the longitudinal axis of the bottle, the stem remains in a fully extended position (as shown in FIG. 10B) due to a small compression spring (not shown) that it is placed within the check valve and co-axially aligned with the longitudinal axis of the bottle. FIG. 11A is a top view of the fully assembled device having a spray bottle therein, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 11B is a cross-sectional side view of the fully assembled device having a spray bottle therein. FIG. 11B is a cross-sectional view taken along line 11B of FIG. 11A. FIG. 11B illustrates the cap 120 being received by the container 110 such that the bottom end 920 of the cap sits on the shoulder 145 of the container. In FIG. 11B, inward forces along the spray bottle's longitudinal axis (in the direction of line F) have been applied on the bottom end 815 of the box shaped member. Such force compressed the spring (not shown) within the spray bottle and moved the stem 1020 inward causing the fluid 1105 to exit the spray hole 613 of the spray bottle and held through the spray opening of the cap. After such forces acting on the bottom end of the box shaped member have been removed, then the spring (not shown) decompresses, causing the stem 1020 to extend and moving the spray bottle back to the fully extended or un-pressed position (as shown in FIG. 10B). FIG. 11B does not show deodorant within the compartment of the container. However, it should be understood that, as explained above, a deodorant, cream, solid, colloid, etc. can be inserted into and held by the compartment.
