Synthesis Example 6
Synthesis of Compound 142
2.11 g (1.84 mmol, yield=52%) of Compound 142 was synthesized in the same manner as in Synthesis Example 1, except that 3.34 g (7.08 mmol) of 6-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)pyrene-1-carbaldehyde was used instead of 1.64 g (7.08 mmol) of 4-phenyl-1-naphthaldehyde, and Intermediate 4-hydroxy-3-(6-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)pyren-1-yl)pent-3-en-2-one was used instead of Intermediate 4-hydroxy-3-(4-phenylnaphthalen-1-yl)pent-3-en-2-one.
