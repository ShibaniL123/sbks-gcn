Example 42
Triethylammonium (N-(8-((3,4,6-O-triacetyl-2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-β-D-galactopyranosyl)oxy)-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl)-4-(((4,4',4″-trimethoxytrityl)oxy)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)methoxy)-4-oxobutanoate 16k
Compound 8k (2.954 g, 3.1 mmol), succinic anhydride (0.931 g, 9.3 mmol) and pyridine (2.0 mL) were stirred at room temperature for 5 days. The reaction mixture was quenched with water and triethylamine (0.4 mL) for 4 h, evaporated to oil, diluted with DCM (100 mL), and washed with 10% aqueous citric acid. Organic phase was basified with triethylamine (0.2 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated. The residue was separated on a silica gel column (1% Et3N, 0-5% MeOH, DCM) to yield 16k (3.02 g, 84.4%).
