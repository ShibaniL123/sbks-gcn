Certain cellular materials made to this point are bounded by those that are 1 ) strong but not fracture resistant, or 2) not strong (i.e., weaker), yet more fracture resistant (i.e., tougher). One aspect identifies a new state of matter that results in a material that is very strong, has high toughness with a density less than that of water. A further aspect is based upon the fabrication of lattice cellular structures with strut diameters in the millimeter range made from nanofoams whose ligaments widths are in the 10 nm to 10 micrometer range. A further aspect is directed to materials, and methods of making and using the same, based on nanoscale structures that are arranged in a hierarchical levels of structural elements from nano to large scale. These materials provide for desirable properties such as an unusual combination of strength and toughness. Properties of interest that these materials can provide include, but are not limited to, high fracture toughness (e.g., 1 -100s MPa.m1/2), strength, low density (e.g., 1 -100s kg/m3), high compressive strength (e.g., 1 -1000 MPa), high Young's Modulus (GPa). Materials of interest for use in preparation of the subject materials include, but are not limited to, styrene template materials, e.g., polystyrene-b- polyisoprene (PS-b-PI), poly(4-fluorostyrene-r-styrene)-b-poly(d,l-lactide) (PFS-b- PLA). Materials which the structural elements of the subject materials may be composed include, but are not limited to, metals, metal containing substances, Ni, ΝΪΑΙ3, NiAL-1 .OTa, NiAI-0.2Hf, SiC, carbon, etc. Structures of interest for use in constructing the subject materials include, but are not limited to, gyroid nanolattices, octet nanolattices, cellular structures, nanofoams, nanoscale ligaments, double gyroid structures, lamellae, cylinder, sphere, octet truss, honeycomb, or any structures. In some cases, the nanostructures have features on a low nm scale, e.g., 10nm diameter scale. Methods of preparation of gyroid materials (for example, see figure directed toward double-gyroid) include use of polystytrene templates where polystyrene polymers may be selectively removed (e.g., by phase separation of block copolymers, dissolution, laser cutting) to create a template to which the material of interest may be added.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION A Hybrid Cellular Materials is shown in FIG. 1 . An "Ashby" map showing the fracture toughness and strengths of engineering materials is shown in FIG. 2. A map of compressive strength and density for engineering materials is shown in FIG. 3. Note that there are no materials that are light and strong. A substantial gap in capability exists before one reaches the theoretical strength verses density line defined b the Hashin-Strickman (H-S) bound for a cellular material made from high quality diamond. A map of the fracture toughness and density of engineering materials in shown in FIG. 4. Again note the gap in materials capabilities at low density. Note also that low density cellular materials usually have very low fracture toughness values which limits their applications. A map of fracture toughness and strength of engineering materials is shown in FIG. 5. Those with a density of 300 kgm3 or less are shown dark shaded. Only very weak polymer foams and cork are available. The invention disclosed here designs a state of matter, and proposes methods for making it that, resulting in cellular materials whose strengths and toughness's will be comparable to carbon steels but whose density could be as low as 700 kgm3. Examples of various types of cellular structures is shown in FIG. 6. An elastic modulus-density map is shown in FIG. 7. The elastic modulus- density map also has gaps at low density and high modulus. An average engineering stress at 1 % strain verses specimen diameter is shown in FIG. 8. Materials get stronger as they are made smaller. Defect sources become harder to operate at lower dimensions. Nano foams with small diameter ligaments enable one to make a large scale material with nanoscale ligaments. The modulus is not effected by making the ligaments small. A diagram of increasing molecular weight verses increasing volume fraction of red component is shown in FIG. 9. For example, polystyrene-b- polyisoprene (PS-b-PI) and poly(4-fluorostyrene-r-styrene)-b-poly(d,l-lactide) (PFS-b-PLA). Phase separation of block copolymers results in a "double-gyroid" morphology as shown. The manufacture of a metal gyroid is illustrated in FIG. 10. A block copolymer poly(4-fluorostyrene-r-styrene)-b-poly(d,l-lactide) (PFS-b-PLA) is used. A phase separation of lactide and styrene occurs to form a "double gyroid" of lactide in a styrene matrix. The selective removal of lactide results in a template of styrene. A desired metal is deposited by electrodeposition. The styrene is dissolved to obtain the "double gyroid." For example, this results in a material with a strut diameter of approx. 13 nm; a unit-cell size of approx. 45 nm; a grain size of approx. 500 nm - 1 micron; and a volume fraction of approx. 40%. The parent material properties can be inferred from various measurements illustrated in FIG. 1 1 . For example, comparing a stress verses strain curve for a solid material and a stress verses strain for a gyroid. Further, a hardness verses 0.2a/R is simulated and measured and compared. Other options for nano-scale lattice manufacture is shown in FIG. 12. For example, a CAD design is developed; two-photon lithography is used to generate a polymer skeleton; sputter/ALD deposition is used to generate an expose internal polymer; and O2 plasma etch is used to generate a hollow nanolattice. A whole range of topologies can be manufactured by this process, as shown in FIG. 13. A graph of compressive strength verses density for lattices achieved to date is shown in FIG. 14. The gyroid though not an optimal topology is "easier" to manufacture and can be produced with a truly nano topology and hence better properties. A graph of compressive strength verses density for carbon based systems is shown in FIG. 15. There seems to be a factor of 4 gain in strength in going from a "macro" to a "nano" C foam. Millimeter scale lattices tend to be intrinsically tough, as shown in FIG. 16. Holes act as crack arrestors. A measurement of fracture toughness of a 25% lattice is shown in FIG. 17. A graph of force verses crack-mouth opening displacement and test sample is shown. Each load-drop corresponds to a cell wall breaking by ductile necking. Predictions of the fracture toughness of elastic/brittle lattices is shown in FIG. 18. A graph of dimensionless toughness verses relative density is shown. The structure of micro-architectured materials such as gyroid and octet truss are shown in FIG. 19. A graph of the fracture toughness verses strength of gyroid and octet truss is shown in FIG. 20. Large cell lattices have exceptional toughness, but unremarkable strength. Nano-scale lattices have exceptional strength, but very poor toughness. The structure of hierarchical materials, including octet lattice from gyroid nanolattice and octet lattice from octet nanolattice are shown in FIG. 21 . The detailed structure of octet lattice from octet nanolattice is shown in FIG. 22. The manufacture of hierarchical materials with this large length-scale separation is a challenge. These material are shown in the graph of fracture toughness verses strength as shown in FIG. 23. The making of hybrid gyroid lattice begins at FIGS. 24 and 25. A PS-b-PI is mixed with PS homopolymer (FIG. 25); phase separated; porous PS after selective PI removal; and finished gyroid material. The making of hierarchical octet lattice assembly is shown in FIG. 26. The making includes (a) gyroid materials preparation, including CVD (ALD) conversion to Ni or SiC gyroid lattice; (b) laser cutting octet lattice patterns, including trusses and octet lattice; and (c) hierarchical octet lattice assembly. The making of gyroid material is shown in FIG. 27. The making includes mixing together PS-b-PI and PS homopolymer; phase separated; porous PS after selective PI removal; and finished gyroid material. The making of a hierarchical octet lattice assembly is shown in FIG. 28. The making includes (a) gyroid materials preparation (i.e. mixing together PS-b- PI and PS homopolymer); (b) laser cutting octet lattice patterns; and (c) hierarchical octet lattice assembly. The making of finished gyroid material octet lattice via ALD is shown in FIG. 29. The making includes (a) phase separated octet lattice; (b) selective PI removal; and (c) finish gyroid material octet lattice via ALD.
