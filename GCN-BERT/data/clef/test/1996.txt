LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES OF THE PLANT CLAIMED Malus domestica Borkh VARIETY DENOMINATION MILLY PRIORITY CLAIM This application claims priority to European Community Plant Variety Office Application No. 2014/0964 filed Apr. 8, 2014, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a new and distinct variety of apple tree, botanically known as Malus domestica Borkh of the Rosaceae family, and hereinafter referred to by the variety denomination ‘MILLY’. The new Malus variety was discovered and selected by the inventor, Luigi Salvi, as a mutation of ‘CRIPPS PINK’, growing in a cultivated area in Ferrara, Italy. The new Malus variety was selected by the inventor based on constant and early production, 3 to 4 weeks before ‘CRIPPS PINK’. Asexual reproduction of the new Malus variety by budding and grafting was first performed in August 2012 in Consandolo, Ferrara, Italy, and has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new variety are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The new variety reproduces true to type. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of ‘MILLY’ which in combination distinguish this Apple tree as a new and distinct variety: 1. Red-purple color;2. Big size, solid flush with weakly defined stripes;3. Weak vigor, open habit with short branches, easy to manage;4. High sugar content; and5. Long storage ability. In comparison to the parental and commercial varieties known to the present inventor, the most similar is the parent variety ‘CRIPPS PINK’. When the claimed variety ‘MILLY’ and the parent variety are compared, they differ primarily in the traits listed in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison with parent and similar variety New Variety Parent Variety Trait ‘MILLY’ ‘CRIPPS PINK’ Time of eating Late Very late—3-4weeks maturity after Milly flowering Very high flowering Good flowering Fruit Constant production Some biennial Production bearing Fruits size Medium-big size Medium size BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new Malus variety MILLY showing the colors as true as is reasonably possible with colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description, which accurately describe the color of MILLY FIG. 1—Shows a mutated branch, right, and the original tree, left. FIG. 2—Shows typical fruit of ‘MILLY’. FIG. 3—Shows the fruit of ‘MILLY’ at different stages of maturity. FIG. 4—Shows the fruit colors of ‘MILLY’. FIG. 5—Shows the fruit of ‘MILLY’ on the plant. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The new Malus variety ‘MILLY’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype of the new variety may vary with variations in environment such as temperature, light intensity, and day length without any change in the genotype of the Apple tree. The aforementioned photographs, together with the following observations, measurements and values describe trees of ‘MILLY’ as grown in the apple farm in Consandolo, Ferrara, Italy, under conditions which closely approximate those generally used in commercial practice. The Apple farm where ‘MILLY’ is grown is situated 30 km from the Adriatic sea (44° 65′ North, 11° 76′ East) and is 4 meters above sea level. The soil of apple farm where ‘MILLY’ is grown is middle clay, the soil is treated with manure and irrigated with drip irrigation systems. The climate is temperate continental with high summer temperatures and low winter temperatures. Unless otherwise stated, the detailed botanical description includes observations, measurements and values based on 3 year old ‘MILLY’ trees that were grown in the Apple farm from Consandolo, Ferrara, Italy from 2012 to 2014. Quantified measurements are expressed as an average of measurements taken from a number of trees of ‘MILLY’. The measurements of any individual tree, or any group of trees, of the new variety may vary from the stated average. Color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart (R.H.S.) 2001 edition, except where general colors of ordinary significance are used. Color values were taken under daylight conditions at approximately at 10:00 a.m. in Consandolo—Ferrara —Italy. All of the trees of ‘MILLY’, insofar as they have been observed, have been identical in all the characteristics described below.
