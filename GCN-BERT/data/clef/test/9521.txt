HOE 72/F 385 The present invention relates to the preparation of cyclohexanediones-(1,3). It is known to prepare cyclohexanediones-(1,3) by iso- merization and <£-enol-lactones having a double bond in the ring or in a semi-cyclic position with sodium alcoholates in benzene. An essential disadvantage of these methods are their poor selectivity, low space-time yields and difficult isolation of the cyclic diketones from the reaction products obtained in an oily form which contain also by-products preventing crystal¬ lization. These drawbacks therefore prevent an economic manufacture of the cyclohexanediones-(1,3). The cyclohexanediones-(1,3) can be converted to indus¬ trially important resorcinols by dehydrogenation. The present invention now provides a process for the pre¬ paration of cyclohexandiones-(1,3) of the formula where the single radicals R are the same or different and represent each a hydrogen atom, an alkyl or aryl group, by isomerization of a enol-lactone having a cylic or semi- cyclic double bond and corresponding to the formulae R R R R R \ /R __R or where R is as defined above, in the presence of a solvent, with HOE 72/F 385 a strong base, wherein the solvent contains at least 50% of a compound belonging to one of the following classes of substances: 1) carboxylic acid amides of the formula R - C - NC where the single radicals R are the same or different and represent each a hydrogen atom, an alkyl or aryl group; 2) phosphoric acid amides of the formula <R R 0 = P. R R where R is as defined above; 3) sulfoxides or sulfones of the formula R - | - R or R"f o R - S - R where R is as defined above. As the strong base acting as isomer!zation agent, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal alcoholates, amides or hydrides may be used. Also alkali or alkaline earth metals per se or their amalgams are suitable, as well as alcoholic solutions of the alcoholates. Especially suitable carboxylic acid amide solvents, which also have an accelerating effect on the isomerization reaction, are dimethyl formamide (DMR), dimethyl acetamide (DMAC) or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). Among the phosphoric acid amides, an especiallly appropriate HOE 72/F 385 105Z823 solvent is hexamethyl-phosphoric acid triamide. From the class of sulfoxides and sulfones, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and sulfolane are preferably used as solvents. The carboxylic acid amides, phosphoric acid amides, sul¬ foxides, sulfones may be used in admixture with other solvents. The amount of the latter is generally up to 30%, but it may be increased up to 50%. Suitable mixture components are for example methanol, diethyl ether, acetonitrile, benzene. The isomerization reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of from 0° to 150«C, preferably from 15° to 70°C, without pressure and continuously or discontinuously. The solvent is generally used in a 10 to 10,000 fold excess, relative to the starting lactone. After recycling, the solvents may be used again. The reaction proceeds with high selectivity (more than 95%) and high space-time yield (more than 300 g/1. hr). Crystallized products having ah high purity degree are obtained, The reaction can be described by the following scheme, when for example 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2-pyranone is used: + NaOCH3 _ + NaCl [I ] (D",)» f i U H3C/ "0V H0CH3 (T ONa 0 O The following-enol-lactones are expecially suitable as starting compounds: S-methyl-S-dihydro-Z-pyranone; 5,6-di- inethyl-3,4-dihydro-2-pyranone; 6-methyl-5-phenyl-3,4-dihydro- 2-pyranone; 5,5-dimethyl-6-methylene-tetrahydro-2-pyranone. The reaction may for example be carried out as follows: the lactone to be isomerized is added to the mixture of the - 4 HOE 72/F 385 isomerization agent and the solvent already present in the recipient continuously, with intense agitation and with such a speed that the concentration of free lactone remains at a low level. Since the solvents in accordance with the present invention accelerate considerably the reaction speed, feeding-in can be carried out very rapidly and thus space-time yields of from 300 to 6 00 g/1. hr may be attained without difficulty. As soon as an amount of lactone equimolar to the condensation agent is added, the solvent is eliminated in vacuo. The salt obtained as residue is dissolved in a certain amount of water, and the solution is acidified with concentrated acid. On cooling, the cyclic diketones precipitate in a pure crystallized form. A small precentage may be obtained in addition by extraction from the aqueous mother liquor. The net yields after recrystallization are superior to 95%. The following Examples illustrate the invention: EXAMPLES 1 TO 10: A mixture of isomerization agent and solvent is intro¬ duced into a 1 liter four-necked flask provided with mechanical agitator, dropping funnel, thermometer and reflux condenser. An amount of the unsaturated lactone equimolar to the iso¬ merization agent, dissolved in a certain amount of solvent is added dropwise and homogeneously. The temperature is controlled by cooling, if necessary. The conversion is observed by means of gas chromatograpy. As long as free isomerization agent is present, the conversion is practically momentary. After complete reaction, the solvent is eliminated in vacuo, the residue is digested with ether, dissolved in a small amount of water, and the solution is acidified with concentrated HOE 72/F 385 hydrochloric acid. When benzene is used as solvent (Example 1), a yellow- brown oil is separated by acidification of the aqueous alkali metal salt solution, from which oil a small amount of dihydro- resorcinol is obtained by complicated crystallization. The yield is 37%. However, when the reaction is carried out in DMF, DMSO or DMAC, a practically pure, crystallized dihydro- resorcinol is obtained with high yields on acidification with cooling by ice. The same goes for the use of DMF/methanol and DMF/diethyl ether mixtures. A small amount may be additionally obtained from the aqueous phase by extraction with methylene chloride. After recrystallization from benzene or ethyl acetate, the yield is superior to 95%.
