DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the above object, the present invention discloses highly enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of functionalized pyrazolidines of formula I via tandem α-amination-Corey Chaykovsky reaction of aldehydes. The reaction allows the creation of three covalent bonds and two contiguous chiral centers in excellent enantio and diastereoselectivity in single step. wherein R is selected from the group consisting of H, halogen, C1 to C10 branched or unbranched alkyl, C1 to C10 cycloalkyl which may optionally be substituted with halo, —OH; aryl which may optionally be as mono or di or tri substituted by halo, hydroxy, nitro, amino, CN, COOH, CONH2, etc., hetero aryl with N, O and/or S atoms as hetero atoms, naphthyl, which may optionally be substituted with halo, hydroxy, nitro, amino, CN, COOH, CONH2, etc; and R′ is selected from ter-butyl, iso-propyl or benzyl groups. The instant invention utilizes commercially available L-Proline as an inexpensive catalyst, simple and easily available starting materials to obtain the functionalized pyrazolidines of formula I in high yield with excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivity. The invention provides a process for synthesis of functionalized pyrazolidines of formula I via tandem α-amination-Corey Chaykovsky reaction of alpha unsubstituted aldehydes, which comprises L-proline catalyzed α-Amination of aldehyde to obtain α-hydrazino aldehydes, which on Corey Chaykovsky reaction in presence of sulfurylide to yield pyrazolidines by ring cyclization. The reaction proceeds with various azodicarboxylates as the nitrogen source, to yield functionalized pyrazolidines of formula I in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities as shown in scheme 1. Accordingly, the synthesis of functionalized pyrazolidines of formula I of the present invention comprises alpha-amination of aldehyde in presence of L-proline to obtain corresponding R-amino aldehyde insitu. As this amino-aldehyde is prone to racemization under basic conditions, an effective reaction conditions were developed to carry out the Corey Chaykovsky reaction by conducting the reaction under various temperature conditions. The addition of the sulfurylide to R-amino aldehyde at 25° C. gave the corresponding pyrazolidine as a single diastereomer in 80% yield with 5% ee (low % ee is probably due to racemization). However, a remarkable improvement in enantioselectivity (75% ee) was realized when the reaction is performed at 10° C. for 2 h. The best results are achieved when the addition of ylide is conducted at (−)5° C. (91% ee with 73% yield). However, further lowering of the temperature to either (−)20° C. or (−)40° C., a deleterious effect on both the yield and enantioselectivity was observed. The optimization of the reaction conditions as discussed above are depicted in table 1. The invention discloses a synthesis for functionalised pyrazolidines of formula I via tandem α-amination-Corey Chaykovsky reaction of aldehydes comprising: a) Reacting an alpha-unsubstituted aldehyde with azodicarboxylates in presence of L-proline to obtain α-hydrazino aldehydes; andb) Subjecting the α-hydrazino aldehydes to Corey Chaykovsky reaction to obtain functionalised pyrazolidines of formula I. The reaction of step a) proceeds at a temperature of 0° C. to (−)5° C. with azodicarboxylates as the nitrogen source in a solvent medium selected from cyclic carbonates, chlorinated solvents, nitriles etc. one preferred solvent for the purpose of proline catalyzed amination is acetonitrile. The Corey Chaykovsky reaction according to the invention is conducted at a temperature of (−) 5° C. in presence of dimethyloxosulfonium methylide in DMSO. The in situ trapping of alpha amino aldehydes according to the invention with dimethyloxosulfonium methylide is shown as scheme 2. The preparation of sulfurylide solution comprises addition of NaH (previously washed with petroleum ether to remove oil) to dry DMSO (10 mL) under stirring at 25° C. in N2 atmosphere followed by addition of trimethyloxosulfonium iodide over a period of 5 min via a solid addition funnel until it became a homogenous solution. The sequential procedure for alpha-Amination/Corey Chaykovsky Reaction of Aldehydes involves reaction of alpha-unsubstituted aldehyde (4a-k) with azadicarboxylate and L-proline in dry CH3CN at 0° C. under stirring for 3 h followed by addition of a solution of dimethyloxosulfonium methylide in DMSO at (−)5° C. and further stirred for 2 h at the same temperature. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC followed by quenched the reaction mass by the addition of an aq. NH4Cl solution. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuum to remove acetonitrile and the concentrate was extracted with diethyl ether. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over anhyd. Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude products, which were then purified by flash column chromatography (100-200 mesh) using petroleum ether and ethyl acetate as eluents to afford the pure Chiral Pyrazolidines (6a-k). Thus the instant invention provides excellent synthetic route for the preparation of functionalized pyrazolidines via tandem α-amination-Corey Chaykovsky reaction of aldehydes in high yields with excellent diastereo and enantioselectivities. The synthesis according to the invention is devoid of metal catalyst and involves organocatalysis. Also, the instant reaction is advantageous being one pot with the creation of two chiral centers in single step. The yields of the functionalized pyrazolidines are in the range of 75-85%, with high diastereo (de>99%) and enantioselectivities (ee>90%). Further, the instant invention encompasses the preparation of pharmaceutically usable derivatives such as salts, solvates and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios. Also, the instant method of synthesis has excellent Functional group tolerance and hence easier to adopt for the synthesis of variousbiologically active compounds such as anti-thrombotic, anti-bacterial, anti-pyretic, anti-depressant molecules, etc. Also, the instant invention is cost-effective as it involves simple and cheaper starting materials. The invention provides optimization of the temperature of the instant reaction by conducting the reaction at various temperature conditions and the results of which are depicted in table 1. According to the results presented in table 1, the temperature of the instant invention is optimized at −5° C. to achieve functionalized pyrazolidines with excellent diastereo and enantioselectivities. In another aspect, the invention provides the optimization of the reaction with Azodicarboxylates at different temperatures and found that the temperature of the instant invention can be optimized at (−)5° C. to achieve functionalized pyrazolidines with excellent diastereo and enantioselectivities as shown in table 1.
