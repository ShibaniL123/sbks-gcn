Plant sRNA extract or plant niiRNA for use as an immunosuppressive agent The present invention relates to a plant sRNA extract for use as an immunosuppressive agent. The present invention further relates to plant miRNA for use as an immunosuppressive agent. In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to plant miRNA for use as an antiinflammatory agent, A wide variety of eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, and fungi, have evolved several RNA-silencing pathways to protect their cells and genomes against invading nucleic acids, such as viruses or transposons, and to regulate gene expression during development or in response to external stimuli (for review, see Baulcombe (2005) Trends Biochem. Sci. 30: 290-293; Meins et al. (2005) Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 21 :297-318). The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) is one of the major scientific breakthroughs in recent years. These small non-coding RNA are changing the way of thinking about the development of the immune system and regulation of immune functions (for a review see Bi Y. et al; MicroRNAs: novel regulators during the immune response. J Cell Physiol. 2009 ar;218(3):467-72; O'Connell R.M. et al.; Physiological and pathological roles for microRNAs in the immune system. Nat Rev Immunol. 2010 Feb; 10(2): 1 11-22). Endogenous miRNAs have been proposed as therapeutics or targets in the cure of cancer and other disorders (Calin G.A and Croce CM; MicroRNA signatures in human cancers. Nat Rev Cancer. 2006 Nov;6(l l):857-66). Recently in addition to the known effects of intracellular or intraspecific miRNAs a more profound change of paradigm has been proposed by the appearance of evidences that indicate the potential of plant miRNAs to modulate human cells (Zhang L et al, Exogenous plant MIR168a specifically targets mammalian LDLRAP1 : evidence of cross- kingdom regulation by microRNA. Cell Research, 2012 22: 107-126). In a recent highly debated report, Zhang et al (supra) discovered that the specific rice MIR168a could specifically target the mammalian low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein, decreasing its expression in liver with consequence on LDL levels. If validated, diet- derived foreign microRNA absorption and function in consuming vertebrates would drastically alter our understanding of nutrition and ecology. Therapeutic exploitation of RNAi in treating human disease is difficult because these accessory processes are absent or diminished in most animals. A recent report challenged multiple paradigms, suggesting that ingested microRNAs (miRNAs) are transferred to blood, accumulate in tissues, and exert canonical regulation of endogenous transcripts (see review by Witwer and Hirsch (2014), Transfer and functional consequences of dietary microRNAs in vertebrates: Concepts in search of corroboration, BioAssays). In plants, RNA-silencing pathways have been shown to control a variety of developmental processes including flowering time, leaf morphology, organ polarity, floral morphology, and root development (reviewed by Mallory and Vaucheret (2006), Nat, Genet, 38:S31- 36). All RNA-silencing systems involve the processing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small RNAs of 21 to 25 nucleotides (nt) by an RNaselll-like enzyme, known as Dicer or Dicer-like in plants (Bernstein et al. (2001) Nature 409: 363-366; Xie et al. (2004) PLoS Biol 2, E104:0642-0652; Xie et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102: 12984-12989; Dunoyer et al, (2005) Nat Genet 37: 1356-1360). These small RNAs are incorporated into silencing effector complexes containing an Argonaute protein (for review, see Meister and Tuschl (2004) Nature 431 : 343-349). There are a number of major differences between plant and animal miRNA: Plant microRNA precursors are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as in animals. However, in contrast to animals the entire process of plant microRNA biogenesis is undertaken within the plant nucleus. The mature microRNAs are exported out of the nucleus by Hasty, an exportin 5-like protein found in plants. There are fundamental differences between plant and animal microRNAs (Axtell, MJ., et al. Vive la difference: biogenesis and evolution of microRNAs in plants and animals. Genome Biology. 12(2011): p. 221-234.): a) In animals miRNA precursors are sequentially processed by Drosha followed by Dicer to produce miRNA duplexes whereas only one Dicer-like enzyme (DCL1) is required in plants. b) In plants miRNA duplexes are methylated at the 2ΌΗ group at the 3' termini. c) The target recognition process between plants and animals is different. In plants miR As direct mRNA cleavage of a microRNA target whereas in animals miRNAs usually inhibit translation of their targets. d) In contrast to the nearly perfect match of plant miRNAs to the exons of their target, hybridization of microRNA to targets in animals is less stringent and only a canonical 7-8 nucleotide "seed sequence" is known to be specific for microRNA target recognition. Studies focus on the role of plant miRNAs in plant; e.g. by the development of artificial miRNAs. Artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) have been described in Arabidopsis targeting viral mRNA sequences (Niu et al. (2006) Nature Biotechnology 24: 1420-1428) or endogenous genes (Schwab et al. (2006) Plant Cell 18: 1121-1133). The amiRNA construct can be expressed under different promoters in order to change the spatial pattern of silencing (Schwab et al. (2006) Plant Cell 18: 1121-1133). Artificial miRNAs replace the microRNA and its complementary star sequence in a miRNA precursor backbone and substitute sequences that target an mRNA to be silenced. Silencing by endogenous miRNAs can be found in a variety of spatial, temporal, and developmental expression patterns (Parizotto et al. (2007) Genes Dev 18:2237-2242; Alvarez et al. (2006) Plant Cell 18: 1134-51). As plant miRNAs are known to target plant target sequences, the effect of plant miRNAs in animals is unknown. Immune-related and inflammatory diseases are the manifestation or consequence of fairly complex, often multiple interconnected biological pathways which in normal physiology are critical to respond to insult or injury, initiate repair from insult or injury, and mount innate and acquired defense against foreign organisms. Disease or pathology occurs when these normal physiological pathways cause additional insult or injury either as directly related to the intensity of the response, as a consequence of abnormal regulation or excessive stimulation, as a reaction to self, or as a combination of these. Though the genesis of these diseases often involves multi-step pathways and often multiple different biological systems/pathways, intervention at critical points in one or more of these pathways can have an ameliorative or therapeutic effect. Therapeutic intervention can occur by either antagonism of a detrimental process/pathway or stimulation of a beneficial process/pathway. Many immune related diseases are known and have been extensively studied. Such diseases include immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, immune mediated renal disease, hepatobiliary diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, and asthma, and non-immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, immunodeficiency diseases, neoplasia, etc. However, there is still a need for treatments of inflammatory diseases, which are more efficient and/or exhibit fewer side effects than known treatments. The same applies for methods of preventing such diseases. siR As have been proposed as a potential break-through in therapy of cancer and other human diseases (Schiffelers RM 2004 NAR). The main limiting step to this therapeutic application is that canonical siRNA duplexes are potent activators of the mammalian innate immune system (Robbins et al, Oligonucleotides 2009) and therefore show undesired off- effects such as their induction of pro -inflammatory processes (Homung V et al, Nat Med 2005; Judge AD et al Nat Biotechnol 2005; Sloud M, J Mol Biol, 2005). Other recent discoveries have shown that both high molecular weight dsRNA and siRNA induce inflammation triggering Toll-like receptor signalling (Tatematsu M, Seya T, Matsumoto M. (2014). Beyond dsRNA: Toll-like receptor 3 signalling in RNA-induced immune responses. Biochem J.,l;458(2): 195-201; Homung V et al, Nat Med 2005; Judge AD et al Nat Biotechnol 2005; Sloud M, J Mol Biol, 2005). Dendritic cells are the best known integrators of external signals, they insert their dendrites within epithelial cells in Peyer's patches, just before the ileo-caecal valve, to sense microorganisms (Swiatczak B, Rescigno M. How the interplay between antigen presenting cells and microbiota tunes host immune responses in the gut. Semin Immunol. 2012 Feb;24(l):43-9). dsRNAs and potentially miRNA are likely recognized as a viral threat and therefore would be expected to elicit a pro-inflammatory response rather than the surprising anti- inflammatory response that we report. Therefore, plant miRNAs targeting beneficial gene regulatory process through specified food intake (i.e probiotics, specific diet regime) will likely be sensed by DCs trough specific mechanisms from the same receptors but in a different manner than viral and human miRNAs (Croce et al., 2012 PNAS) Also, DC master regulators of immune response modulated inflammation and tolerance by interacting with T cells directly or through cytokine production. Human internally produced miRNAs are normally implicated in establishing and maintaining the cell fate of immune cells (e.g. miR-155 (O'Connell R.M. et al; MicroRNA- 155 promotes autoimmune inflammation by enhancing inflammatory T cell development. Immunity. 2010), miR-181a (Li QJ et al, 2007. miR-181a is an intrinsic modulator of T cell sensitivity and selection. Cell 129: 147-161), miR-150 (Xiao C et al. 2007. MiR-150 controls B cell differentiation by targeting the transcription factor c-Myb. Cell 131 : 146- 159), miR-223 (Johnnidis JB et al., 2008. Regulation of progenitor cell proliferation and granulocyte function by microRNA-223. Nature 451 : 1125-1129) and miR146 (Taganov KD et al, NF-kappaB-dependent induction of microRNA miR-146, an inhibitor targeted to signaling proteins of innate immune responses. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2006; 103: 12481- 6.). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention relates a plant sRNA extract for use as an immunosuppressive agent. Surprisingly, it was found that plant sRNA extract and plant miRNAs exhibit an antiinflammatory effect, as opposed to what was observed for canonical siRNAs and exogenously supplied mammalian miRNAs (Croce et al. 2012 PNAS). Surprisingly, it could be shown that administering plant sRNA extract and/or plant miRNA in conjunction with different inflammatory agents, dampens inflammation per se and also prevents inflammation. Therefore, the experiments surprisingly show that plant sRNA extracts and plant miRNA are effective as anti-inflammatory agents, which can attenuate T cell proliferation and production both of inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules in stimulated human dendritic cells, as described in the Examples. This result shows a profound functional difference of plant miRNA as compared to human miRNA, i.e an opposite role in immuno -modulatory properties. Therefore, plant sRNA extracts and plant miRNA exhibit unique, unexpected properties. According to the present invention, a "plant sRNA extract" is understood as a composition comprising plant material of a given plant variety wherein the amount of sRNA of said plant variety in comparison to other RNA of the same plant variety in said composition is higher than in naturally occurring plant material of said plant variety. In a preferred embodiment, the "plant sRNA extract" is understood as a composition comprising plant material of a given plant variety wherein the amount of sRNA of said plant variety in comparison to other RNA of the same plant variety in said composition is at least 10% higher than in naturally occurring plant material of said plant variety, more preferably at least 20%, 50%, 100% or 200% higher than in naturally occurring plant material of said plant variety. Typically, the amount is determined as (w/v) or (w/w). In more preferred embodiment, the "plant sRNA extract" according to the present application refers to the purified small RNA fraction of a plant optionally dissolved in a suitable solvent. The plant miRNA extract when dissolved in a suitable solvent comprises less than 20%> (w/v), preferably less than 10%> (w/v), more preferably less than 5% (w/v), even more preferably less than less than 1% (w/v) of other plant components, in particular other RNA. A suitable solvent is preferably an aqueous solution, which is more preferably a buffered aqueous solution, which may comprise further substance like RNAse inhibitors. In case the extract is not dissolved, the extract may be solid, for example it may be a dry, dried, or freeze-dried extract. Also, the extract may be in the form of a liquid or frozen fluid, such as a solution, suspension, dispersion, or the extract may be in the form of a gel. For extraction from plant, a complete plant or parts thereof of may be used. Preferably, plant sRNA may be extracted from leaves, flowers, roots, fruits, seeds or parts thereof. In particular strawberry fruits may be used. The plant or parts thereof are preferably ground or shredded prior to extraction. For example, the plant or parts thereof may be pulverized, in particular in liquid nitrogen as described in Example 1. In another preferred embodiment, the "plant sR A extract" according to the present application refers to the purified small R A fraction of a plant optionally dissolved in a suitable solvent. The plant miR A extract when dissolved in a suitable solvent comprises less than 20% (w/v), preferably less than 10% (w/v), more preferably less than 5% (w/v), even more preferably less than less than 1% (w/v) of other plant components. According to the present invention, the term "plant" encompasses any member of the plant-kingdom according to the Linnaeus definition, encompassing both vascular and nonvascular plants. In a preferred embodiment of the extract for use of the present invention, the sRNA has a length of 200 nucleotides or less, preferably a length of 120 nucleotides or less, preferably a length between 10 and 120 nucleotides. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the "sRNA plant extract" comprises the sRNA of a plant which has a length of 200 nucleotides or less, preferably a length of 120 nucleotides or less, preferably a length between 10 and 120 nucleotides. In an even more preferred embodiment, the sRNA has a length of 10 nucleotides or more. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the "sRNA plant extract" comprises the sRNA of a plant which has a length of 10 nucleotides or more. Thus, in an even more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the sRNA has a length of between 10 and 200 nucleotides, preferably a length of between 10 and 160 nucleotides, more preferably a length of between 10 and 120 nucleotides, even more preferably a length of between 10 and 100 nucleotides, even more preferably a length of between 10 and 50 nucleotides, most preferably a length of between 10 and 25 nucleotides. Therefore, in yet a further preferred embodiment, the "sRNA plant extract" comprises the sRNA of a plant which has a length of between 10 and 200 nucleotides, preferably a length of between 10 and 160 nucleotides, more preferably a length of between 10 and 120 nucleotides, even more preferably a length of between 10 and 100 nucleotides, even more preferably a length of between 10 and 50 nucleotides, most preferably a length of between 10 and 25 nucleotides. The sRNA fraction extracted from plants containing the sRNA of a plant which has a length of between 10 and 25 nucleotides corresponds to the miRNA fraction. Therefore, this sRNA plant extract is particularly preferred. "sRNA" according to the present invention is small RNA, in particular RNA of a length of 200 nucleotides or less. In a further preferred embodiment, the sRNA does not contain ribosomal RNA, or contains less than 70%, 50%, 10%, 10% or 1% ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the same plant variety. For example, the ribosomal RNA is 5S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, 18S rRNA, or 28S rRNA. Therefore, in a yet further preferred embodiment, the sRNA has a length of length of 120 nucleotides or less, preferably a length between 10 and 120 nucleotides. In a preferred embodiment of the extract for use of the invention, the sRNA is miRNA. In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to miRNA for use as an immunosuppressive agent. In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to a plant sRNA extract as defined above or plant miRNA for use in a method for treating and/or preventing an inflammatory disease. As used herein the term "inflammatory disease" and/or "inflammation", used interchangeably, includes inflammatory abnormalities characterized by enhanced immune response to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants.

In a particularly preferred embodiment, said allergic disease is selected from the group consisting of a) allergic respiratory disease, such as bronchial asthma, pediatric asthma, allergic asthma, atopic asthma, aspirin asthma, or allergic bronchitis, b) allergic nasal disease, such as allergic rhinitis, vernal catarrh, hay fever, or chronic allergic rhinitis, c) an allergic skin disease, such as atopic dermatitis, d) an allergic ocular disease, such as hay fever, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, or chronic allergic conjunctivitis, e) hypersensitivity pneumonitis, f) contact dermatitis, and g) food allergy. In a further preferred embodiment, said inflammatory disease is psoriasis. In a further preferred embodiment, said inflammatory disease is inflammatory bowel disease, more preferably Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. In a further preferred embodiment, said inflammatory disease is ulcerative colitis. As used herein, "inflammatory bowel disease" also refers to a related disease and refers to all types and stages of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including, but not limited to: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Optionally, conditions relating to IBD include, e.g., Collagenous colitis, Lymphocytic colitis, Ischaemic colitis, Diversion colitis, Behcet's disease, Indeterminate colitis. As used herein, "psoriasis" also refers to a related disease and refers to all types and stages of psoriasis, including, but not limited to: Nonpustular Psoriasis including Psoriasis vulgaris and Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis), Pustular psoriasis including Generalized pustular psoriasis (pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch), Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (persistent palmoplantar pustulosis, pustular psoriasis of the Barber type, pustular psoriasis of the extremities), Annular pustular psoriasis, Acrodermatitis continua, Impetigo herpetiformis. Optionally, conditions relating to psoriasis include, e.g., drug-induced psoriasis, Inverse psoriasis, Napkin psoriasis, Seborrheic- like psoriasis, Guttate psoriasis, Nail psoriasis, Psoriatic arthritis. In the Examples, it is shown that plant sRNA extracts and plant miR As attenuate T cell proliferation and the expression and/or production of IL-Ιβ, TNFa, CD80, CD86 and CD83 of stimulated dendritic cells. Therefore, plant sRNA extracts and plant miRNAs are in particular useful in the treatment and/or prevention of autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases, in which IL-Ιβ, TNFa, CD80, CD86 and/or CD83 play a role, and/or wherein dendritic cells are dysregulated. For example in patients with Crohn's disease, pro -inflammatory Thl7 and Thl cytokines outweigh the effect of antiinflammatory cytokines secreted by regulatory T cells (Treg). This results in an imbalance of pro -inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, Crohn's disease may be treated and/or prevented with plant miRNA according to the present invention. Thus, in a further preferred embodiment, the inflammatory disease is characterized by an increase in CD4+ T cell proliferation. Thus, in a further preferred embodiment, the inflammatory disease is characterized by an increase in expression or production of at least one of inflammatory biomarker, in particular selected from IL-Ιβ and TNFa and/or wherein the inflammatory disease is characterized by a dysregulation of the cytokines or co-receptors in at least, and/or by a dysregulation of immune function as detectable in changing of DC activity (i.e. costimulatory molecules expression). Thus, in a further preferred embodiment, the inflammatory disease is characterized by an increase in expression or production of IL-10, such as lymphoma, in particular non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma, melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. A "patient" is understood as animal, in particular a human in need of treatment and/or prevention. Accordingly, the plant sRNA extract or plant miRNA for use in prevention and/or treatment is suitable for the prevention and/or treatment of animals, in particular humans in need of treatment and/or prevention. As shown in the Examples, plant sRNA extracts from monocot and dicot plants are effective in attenuating the T cell proliferation. Surprisingly, the total sRNA extract from strawberry, namely Fragaria vesca, is even more effective. Thus, the sRNA extract for use may be from any plant, in particular from a monocot or dicot. For example, plant sRNA extracted from soybean, maize, or strawberry may be used. In a preferred embodiment of the plant sRNA extract or plant miRNA for use of the invention, the plant is a flowering plant. In a more preferred embodiment of the plant sRNA extract or plant miRNA for use of the invention, the plant is a Rosacea spp. Rosaceae plants are known to a skilled person in include the subfamily Rosoideae, in particular rose, blackberry, raspberry, strawberry, Potentilla and Geum; the subfamily Amygdaloideae, in particular pome fruits, traditionally known as subfamily Maloideae or Pyroideae, like apple, cotoneaster, and hawthorn; the Spiraeoideae; and the subfamily Dryadoideae, in particular the genera Dryas, Cercocarpus, Chamaebatia, Cowania, and Purshia. In an even more preferred embodiment of the plant sRNA extract or plant miRNA for use of the invention, the plant is a strawberry, most preferred Fragaria vesca. In a yet further preferred embodiment, one or more different plant sRNA extracts and/or plant miRNAs are administered. For example 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 different plant sRNA extracts may be administered. For example, sRNA extracts from strawberry and soybean may be administered. The one or more different plant sRNA extracts may be administered together or separately, or they may be administered simultaneously, or at different time points. Moreover, some synthetic specific plant miRNAs are effective in attenuating T cell proliferation and the expression and/or production of inflammatory cytokines IL-Ιβ, TNFa, and immune reactivity of stimulated dendritic cells by means of CD80, CD86 and CD83 proper expression. A synthetic miRNA is understood as a miRNA which exists naturally in a plant, which is obtained by chemical synthesis. Alternatively, the specific plant miRNAs may be purified from plants. The synthesis of miRNA is known in the art and is for example described in Example 1. The plant miRNA for use of the invention is preferably a purified miRNA. A purified plant miRNA typically contains less than 10%, 1%, 0,01% or 0,001% of other components, in particular plant components. The one or more different plant miRNAs may be administered together or separately, or they may be administered simultaneously, or at different time points. Preferably, at least one plant sRNA extract and/or two or more purified miRNAs are administered. Surprisingly, miR168 from Fragaria vesca is highly effective regarding its immunesuppressive effect, as shown in the examples. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the plant miRNA for use according to the invention is F. vesca miR168. In particular, plant sRNA extracts from one plant or more than one plant may be administered. For example plant sRNA extracts from two different plant varieties or different plant families may be administered. "More than one" is understood to encompass for example 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14, 20, 40 or more. Plant sRNA extracts can be obtained as described in the Examples. In a further preferred embodiment, the two or more plant sRNA extracts may be administered as a mixture of plant sRNA extracts. In particular, plant sRNA extracts from two different plant varieties or different plant families may be mixed and may be administered thereafter. The plant sR A extracts preferably contain methylated miRNAs or the miRNAs of the extract are methylated. In a further preferred embodiment, a plant miRNA for use is a methylated miRNA. A methylated miRNA for use according to the invention is preferably methylated at the 2ΌΗ group of the 3' terminus. The miRNAs for use according to the invention may be produced recombinantly using miRNA expression constructs, using methods known in the art (Schwab, R., Ossowski, S., Riester, M., Warthmann, N., and Weigel, D. (2006). Highly specific gene silencing by artificial microRNAs in Arabidopsis. The Plant Cell 18, 1121-1133), or may be isolated from plants. Preferably, mature miRNA molecules are administered. A number of miRNAs are described in the prior art and may be used according to the invention. These miRNAs are described in a large number of plant species as shown in Table 1 below (Kozomara, A., and Griffiths- Jones, S. (2011). miRBase: integrating microRNA annotation and deep-sequencing data. Nucleic Acids Research 39, D152- D157). These miRNAs were also described in Fragaria ananassa (Ge, A., Shangguan, L., Zhang, X., Dong, Q., Han, J., Liu, H., Wang, X., and Fang, J. (2012).

A particularly preferred miRNA is miR168, in particular Fragaria vesca miR168. A "miRNA" or "microRNA" for use according to the present invention is understood as oligoribonucleic acid, of about 19 to 24 nucleotides (nt) in length, which regulates expression of a polynucleotide comprising a target sequence. miRNAs are non-protein- coding RNAs and have been identified in both animals and plants. miRNAs are derived in plants via Dicer-like 1 processing of larger precursor polynucleotides. The term "miRNA" also encompasses "artificial miRNA", which comprise a miRNA sequence that is synthetically designed to silence a target sequence. In particular, such artificial miRNA exhibits 80% or more, preferably 90%> or more, even more preferably 91%>, 92%>, 93%>, 94%), 95%o, 96%o, 97%o, 98%>, 99%> or more sequence identity with the nucleotide sequence of the unmodified miRNA or miRNA precursor backbone. In a preferred embodiment, the plant miRNA is methylated at the 2ΌΗ group at the 3' terminus. In a preferred embodiment, endogenous miRNAs are used, as the mechanism appears to be target-independent. "miRNA precursor backbone" is a polynucleotide that provides the backbone structure necessary to form a hairpin RNA structure which allows for the processing and ultimate formation of the miRNA. Preferably, the backbone is from strawberry, rice, maize or soybean. microRNA precursor backbones have been described previously. For example, US20090155910A1 (WO 2009/079532) discloses the following soybean miRNA precursor backbones: 156c, 159, 166b, 168c, 396b and 398b, and US 20090155909A1 (WO 2009/ 079548) discloses the following maize miRNA precursor backbones: 159c, 164h, 168a, 169r, and 396h. Examples of miRNA precursor backbones include the miRNA GM-396b precursor backbone or active variants thereof and the miRNA GM-159 precursor backbone or active variants thereof, as described in WO 2012/154824. A "miRNA expression construct" is understood as DNA construct which comprises a miRNA precursor backbone having a polynucleotide sequence encoding a miRNA and a star sequence. Such miRNA expression construct may be in a suitable vector, to allow expression in a suitable host, followed by isolation of the miRNA. Such expression systems are known to a skilled person and are for example described in (Schwab, R., Ossowski, S., Riester, M., Warthmann, N., and Weigel, D. (2006). Highly specific gene silencing by artificial microRNAs in Arabidopsis. The Plant Cell 18, 1 121-1133) The plant miRNAs and plant sRNA extracts for use surprisingly exhibit anti-inflammatory activity.

Thus, in a further preferred embodiment, the plant sRNA extract or the plant miRNA for use of the invention is administered in combination with at least one other antiinflammatory agent. In a more preferred embodiment, said other anti-inflammatory agent is selected from the group consisting of a corticosteroid, a statin, interferon beta, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), methotrexate, Cyclosporin A and a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).

Examples Example 1 : Preparation of a plant sRNA extracts and synthesis of miRNAs miR156, miR168, osamiR168 and small duplex sGFP (Figures 1 and 2) Plant sRNAs were extracted using the mirPremier microRNA Isolation Kit (Sigma- Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol. We collected several plant materials, encompassing the plant kingdom: strawberry fruits from Fragaria vesca (cv. Hawaii 4), blueberry, raspberry fruits, apple skin, cabbage leaves and flowers; Traminer grape; fern leaves; Arabidopsis thaliana leaves; wild rice and corn. All of them were pulverized in liquid nitrogen. One hundred milligrams were mixed with the buffer provided in the kit. The small RNA fraction was separated from the high molecular weight RNA by the use of columns included in the kit. Small RNA was finally eluted using RNAse-free water. After each extraction, samples will be analyzed using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit through the BioAnalyzer instrument. Examples of the sRNA profiles used in the patent are showed in Figure 1. Figure 1A shows the six RNA markers in nucleotides (nt); Figure IB shows the profile obtained by running a total RNA samples encompassing the high molecular weight fraction, identifiable by the 28S and 18S peaks, and the sRNA fraction of low molecular weight, on the left of the electropherogram. Figure 1C-1G panels show examples of the sRNA fractions used in the experiments here presented. Figure 1H shows a sample that has been excluded after the analysis since high molecular weight RNA contamination (18S and 28S) is present. Furthermore we analyzed each sRNA preparation using the Agilent Small RNA kit. Through BioAnalyzer analysis we characterized the size of the sRNA present in each fraction we use in the next experiments. Size determination has been assessed on the basis of the retention time with respect to the known sizes and timing of the ladder peaks. The fraction of interest is between 10 and 120 nucleot ides (nt) for all the plant sRNA extracts. Synthetic plant small RNA duplexes (Figure 2) were synthesized by Sigma Genosys and purified by HPLC. The annealing of small RNA strands and the methylation at 3' was performed as described by Sigma oligo synthesis service (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/custom-oligos/sima-oligos.html). Upon arrival the small RNA duplexes were resuspended in RNAse-free water to the appropriate concentration. Example 2: Evaluation of sRNAs effects on the T cell proliferation (Figure 3). In a Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR) assay, human CD4+ T cells were co-cultured with allogenic human monocyte-derived DCs in presence or not (positive control) of the different plant sRNA extracts. The MLR is a functional assay which measures the proliferative response of lymphocytes from one individual (the responder) to lymphocytes from another individual (the stimulator). In detail, peripheral blood mononucleated cells were collected by Ficoll gradient centrifugation from healthy donor buffy coat. CD14+ monocytes were then isolated by a positive magnetic selection and differentiate in immature DCs in medium containing IL-4 and GM-CSF. After 5 days, such monocyte- derived DCs were collected and used for the following challenges experiments. For MLR, DCs were co-cultured in the presence of CD4+ T cells with or without the presence of sRNA extracts. In each experiment (this or the following) sRNAs or miRNAs are complexed with DOTAP, a liposomal transfection agent, which facilitates nucleic acid entry into the cells (Carvalho et al. TLR3 essentially promotes protective class I-restricted memory CD8+ T-cell responses to Aspergillus fumigatus in hematopoietic transplanted patients. Blood. 2012 Jan 26; 119(4):967-77; Bourquin C et al. Immunostimulatory RNA oligonucleotides induce an effective antitumoral NK cell response through the TLR7. J Immunol. 2009 Nov 15;183(10):6078-86). DOTAP is also added to the control cells to exclude cross reactivity). Any sRNA extracts tested, used at the more physiological concentration retrieved in host biofluids (10 ng/ml,) were able to attenuate the T cell proliferation (Figure 3). Example 3 : Evaluation of miRNAs effects on the immune cells properties and their ability to respond to an inflammatory stimulus In in vitro experiments, human monocyte-derived DCs were exposed to the purified miRNAs (or Fragaria vesca pure sRNA extracts) and then pre-treated DCs were challenged with purified LPS, the lipopolysaccharide layer of bacterial wall. This experiment allowed determining the sRNA effect on the activation process and maturation of the DC through co-stimulatory molecules analysis by flow cytometry and detection of soluble factors such as cytokines by DC on culture medium. Co-stimulatory molecules expressions on DC cell surface are markers of proper activation and maturation of the immune cell. Increasing levels of these molecules promote DC-T cells contact and antigen presentation thus activating T cells and their survival, priming the proper adaptive immune response. Cytokines could enhance the cellular response (i.e pro-inflammatory cytokines as IL-6, TNFa, IL-Ιβ, IL-12p70, IL-23, INFy, IL-17), promote type-2 response and thus favoring antibody production (IL-4, IL-13, IL-5) or down-regulate inflammatory process (IL-10, TGF ). In particular, comparing the levels of CD80, CD86, CD83 and the class II immuno- histocompatibility complex (MHCII o HLA-DR) of DC pre-exposed to miRNAs or treated with LPS alone evidence a possible attenuation effects of the specific miRNAs. In parallel by evaluating the released cytokine profiles the ability of DCs to properly respond to the stimuli was assessed. Measuring the level of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNFa, IL-Ιβ, IL- 12p70) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines, allowed appreciation of the immunomodulatory ability of the specific miRNAs. For all treated DC, 24h- IL-Ιβ, TNFa, IL-10 production and 48h- CD80, CD86, CD83 and MHCII expression were analyzed. The cells were then used in mixed lymphocyte reaction, where treated DCs were co-cultured in the presence of CD4+ T cells. INFy production was evaluated on culture supernatants after 5 days. The general experimental design is shown in Figure 4. In a first set of experiments dendritic cells (DC) were treated with the following agents, respectively: Fragaria vesca specific small duplex miR156 (FvmiR156) (SEQ ID Nos. 1 and 2; Figure 2A) Fragaria vesca small duplex miR168 (FvmiR168) (SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4; Figure 2B) rice small duplex osamiR168 (SEQ ID Nos. 5 and 6; Figure 2C) • Fragaria vesca total sRNAs fraction (FvsRNA) · small duplex chemically modified green fluorescent protein sequence (sGFP; SEQ ID Nos. 7 and 8; Figure 2D) (these already served as negative control for many groups (see Robbins M, 2008, Hum Gen Ther)); • F. vesca total high molecular weight RNA fraction (FvRNA) E. coli LPS (positive control) • E. coli LPS after 2 h pre-exposure to the all nucleic acids above Several miR As concentrations were tested, ranging from the physiological (lOng/ml) to the common experimental concentrations for nucleic acids (l(^g/ml, Liu XI et al. (2010)). MicroPvNA-148/152 impair innate response and antigen presentation of TLR-triggered dendritic cells by targeting CaMKIIa. J Immunol. 15;185(12):7244-51; Carvalho et al. TLR3 essentially promotes protective class I-restricted memory CD8+ T-cell responses to Aspergillus fumigatus in hematopoietic transplanted patients. Blood. 2012 Jan 26;119(4):967-77; Bourquin C et al. Immunostimulatory RNA oligonucleotides induce an effective antitumoral NK cell response through the TLR7. J Immunol. 2009 Nov 15;183(10):6078-86). Even if the strongest inhibitory effects were seen at the highest concentrations, in order to avoid possible saturation effects of the system the Example showed results using the more physiological concentration of miRNAs retrieved in host bio fluids (Figure 5 and 6). While the high molecular weight RNA fraction does not affect DCs activation by LPS, plant miRNAs and plant sRNA fraction modulate both cytokine and co-stimulatory expression. In particular, plant sRNAs significantly attenuate IL-Ιβ, TNFa and IL-10 production by LPS, as shown in Figure 5. Moreover, FvmiR68 showed the strongest effects. In addition, it could be shown that plant sRNAs limit the increase of CD80, CD86 and CD83 expression (Figure 6). In a further set of experiments (Figure 7 and 8), in order to investigate the possible effect of the presence of the methyl group in the plant miRNA sequence, which is not present in endogenous DC human miRNAs, two human miRNAs (miR148, miR155 and its star form miRl 55*), known to affect DC response to LPS (for a review, Zhan and Wu, Functional regulation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells by microRNAs. Protein Cell. 2012 Jul;3(7):497-507) were used. DCs were treated with the following agents, respectively: • human miR155 · human miRl 55 methylated • human miRl 48 • human miRl 48 methylated The methylated miRNAs were synthetized by adding a methyl group at the 2ΌΗ group of the 3' terminus. The methyl group did not change the ability of human miRNAs to modulate the DC response to LPS. In further experiments to evaluate if not only sRNA fractions but also synthetic plant miRNA could modulate T cell proliferation, prior LPS treatment DCs were exposed for 2 h to: • Fragaria vesca small duplex miR168 (FvmiR168) (SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4; Figure 2B) · rice small duplex osamiR168 (SEQ ID Nos. 5 and 6; Figure 2C) • Fragaria vesca total sRNAs fraction (FvsRNA) • hsamiR155 • hsamiR148 and then co-cultured with CD4+ T cells. sRNA- and miRNA-treated-DCs seem to have a lower immunostimulatory ability since LPS-induced IFN-γ is less produced by T cells (Figure 9). MLR assay showed that FvmiR168 and FvsRNA modulate T cell proliferation (Figure 10). 1. A plant sRNA extract for use as an immunosuppressive agent. 2.
