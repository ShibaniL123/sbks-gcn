LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES OF THE PLANT CLAIMED Phalaenopsis hybrida VARIETY DENOMINATION ‘Charming’ BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Phalaenopsis plant, botanically known as Phalaenopsis of the Orchidaceae family, and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name ‘Charming’. Phalaenopsis comprises a genus of about 55 species of herbaceous perennials many of which, or the hybrids thereof, are suitable for cultivation in the home or greenhouse. Phalaenopsis is predominantly epiphytic or rock-dwelling, and is native to tropical Asia, the Malay Archipelago, and Oceania. The species typically has 2-ranked, fleshy, oblong or elliptic leaves affixed to a short central stem (monopodial growth), which vary in size from 5 to 8 inches to over 2 feet. The leaves may be entirely green or mottled with silver grey. Phalaenopsis orchids, often referred to as ‘Moth Orchids’ in the horticultural trade, are frequently used to furnish cut flowers for the florist trade or sold as flowering potted-plants for home or interiorscape. Phalaenopsis produces upright or pendent lateral racemes, often with many showy flowers which open in succession beginning with the lowermost. The flowers possess three sepals and three petals; the lateral ones being alike. The lowermost petal, called the labellum, is three-lobed and is often more brightly-colored than the other flower segments. Flower colors include various shades of pink, white, yellow and red-brown. Phalaenopsis orchids are typically propagated from seeds. Asexual propagation of Phalaenopsis is often done from off-shoots which frequently arise from the lower bracts of the inflorescence. The resulting plants are detached from the mother plant and may be planted in a suitable substrate. The new Phalaenopsis ‘Charming’ is a product of a controlled breeding program conducted by the inventor, René Schoone, in Strengweg, Heemskerk, The Netherlands. The objective of the breeding program was to develop a new Phalaenopsis cultivar particularly characterized by its attractive and unique colored flowers, economical propagation via tissue culture, rapid growth, and a plant dimension suitable for packaging and shipping to the market. The new Phalaenopsis ‘Charming’ originated from a cross made by the inventor in 2001 in Strengweg, Heemskerk, The Netherlands. The female or seed parent is the Phalaenopsis cultivar designated ‘Yu Pin Natsume’, unpatented. The male or pollen parent is the Phalaenopsis cultivar designated ‘I-Hsin Sunflower’, unpatented. The new Phalaenopsis ‘Charming’ was discovered and selected by the inventor as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross in a controlled environment in 2009 in Strengweg, Heemskerk, The Netherlands. Asexual reproduction of the new Phalaenopsis cultivar by tissue culture (mericloning) was first performed in November, 2009 in Cieweg 13, Heemskerk, The Netherlands, and has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new cultivar are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The new cultivar asexually reproduces true-to-type. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of ‘Charming’, which in combination distinguish this Phalaenopsis as a new and distinct cultivar: 1. flowers which are yellow with red/purple spots and stripes; 2. plant produces more than one inflorescence; 3. plants may be propagated economically and uniformly using tissue culture; 4. inflorescences are long and sturdy; and 5. relatively short, dark-green foliage. In comparison with the parental cultivars of ‘Charming’, the female parent ‘Yu Pin Natsume’ has yellow flowers with a purple mark (mostly in the center) whereas the flowers of ‘Charming’ are yellow with red/purple spots and stripes. The flowers of the male parent ‘I-Hsin Sunflower’ are also yellow with red/purple spots, only less and smaller spots and less red/purple in the labellum. Presently, the commercial cultivar to which ‘Charming’ can be meaningfully compared is ‘Grazia’ (U.S. Plant patent application Ser. No. 13/986,294). The flowers of ‘Charming’ are yellow with red/purple stripes whereas the flowers of ‘Grazia’ have more red/purple on the sepals and petals and yellow on the edges. Also differs the shape of the petals/sepals and the shape of the labellum. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new Phalaenopsis ‘Charming’ showing the colors as true as is reasonably possible with colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description, which accurately describe the color of ‘Charming’. FIG. 1 shows a side view perspective of a typical flowering plant of ‘Charming’ in a 12 cm pot, at 16 months of age. FIG. 2 shows a close-up view of the typical flower of ‘Charming’. FIG. 3 shows a close-up view of the typical leaves of ‘Charming’. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The new Phalaenopsis cultivar ‘Charming’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype of the new cultivar may vary with variations in environment such as temperature, light intensity, and day length without any change in the genotype of the plant. The aforementioned photographs, together with the following observations, measurements and values describe plants of ‘Charming’ as grown in a greenhouse in Strengweg, Heemskerk, The Netherlands, under conditions which closely approximate those generally used in commercial practice. Initially, the ideal temperature to grow plants of ‘Charming’ is 27° C. during the day and at night. Then, during the flowering phase of ‘Charming’, the ideal growing temperature is 20-22° C. during the day and 18° C. at night. Light levels for growing ‘Charming’ are a minimum of 5,000 lux and a maximum of 10,000 lux. A balanced fertilizer with level of 200 ppm N, 87 ppm P, 168 ppm K is applied. Duration of growth of ‘Charming’ from potting size is between 10 and 14 months. Color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart (R.H.S.), 2007 edition, except where general colors of ordinary significance are used. Color values were taken under daylight conditions at approximately noon in Zaandammerweg, Assendelft, The Netherlands. The age of the ‘Charming’ plants described is 12 months after potting.
