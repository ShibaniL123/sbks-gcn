[0164] . The form of administration of compound (I) with a concomitant drug is not particularly limited and is acceptable as long as compound (I) is combined with a concomitant drug at the time of administration. Examples of such forms of administration are as follows: (1) Administration of a single formula obtained simultaneous formulation of compound (I) with a concomitant drug, (2) Simultaneous administration via the same administration route for two kinds of formulas obtained by independent formulations of compound (I) and a concomitant drug, (3) Administrations at different times via the same administration route for two kinds of formulas obtained by independent formulations of compound (I) and a concomitant drug, (4) Simultaneous administration via different administration routes for two kinds of formulas obtained by independent formulations of compound (I) and a concomitant drug, (5) Administrations at different times via different administration routes for two kinds of formulas obtained by independent formulations of compound (I) and a concomitant drug (for example, administration in the order of compound (I) to a concomitant drug, or administration in the reversed order). Hereinafter, these forms of administration are collectively abbreviated as the combination agent of the present invention. . [0165] . When administering the combination' agent of the present invention, a concomitant drug and compound (I) can.be administered simultaneously. Alternatively, compound (I) can be administered after a concomitant drug is administered, or a concomitant drug can be administered after compound (I) is administered. When administering at different times, the time difference depends upon the active ingredients to be administered, drug forms and methods of administration. For example, when a concomitant drug is administered first, compound (I) can be administered within 1 min to 3 days, preferably within 10 min to 1 day,, more preferably within 15 min to 1 hour after the concomitant drug is administered. When compound (I) is administered first, a concomitant drug can be administered within 1 min to 1 day, preferably within 10 min to 6 hours, more preferably within 15 min to 1 hour after compound (I) is administered. [0166] , If there are no problems with side effects of concomitant drugs, any dosages can be set. A daily dosage as a concomitant drug depends upon dosages, administration subjects, administration routes, target diseases, symptoms and.the like. For example, for oral administration to a schizophrenia patient (adult, about 60 kg weight), it is generally about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.2 to 10 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.5 to 10 mg/kg body weight as a single dose, which is desirably administered once to several times (e.g., 3 times) a day. If compound (I) is used in combination with a concomitant drug, the respective dosages can be reduced within a safe range with consideration of the opposite effects of the respective drugs. [0167] The combination agent of the present invention shows low toxicity. For example, the compound of (I) or(and) the above-mentioned concomitant drug can be combined with a pharmacologically acceptable carrier according to the known method to prepare a pharmaceutical composition such as tablet (including sugar-coated tablet and film-coated tablet), powder, granule, capsule (including soft capsule), liquid, injection, suppository, sustained-release agent and the like. These compositions can be administered safely orally or parenterally (e.g., including locally, rectally, intravenously etc.). [0168] The pharmacologically acceptable carriers that can be used for manufacturing, the combination agent of the present , invention can be the same as those used in the pharmaceutical composition comprising compound (I) as mentioned above. [0169] A mixing ratio between compound. (I) and a concomitant drug in the combination agent of the present invention can be selected appropriately based on the administration subjects, administration routes and diseases. The above-mentioned concomitant drugs can be used in a combination of two or more kinds thereof in an appropriate ratio. A dosage of the concomitant drug can be selected appropriately based on the dosages used clinically. In addition, a mixing ratio between compound (I) and a concomitant drug can be selected appropriately based on the administration subjects, administration routes, target diseases, symptoms, combinations and the like. For example, if the administration subject is human, a concomitant drug can be used in an amount ranging from 0.01 to 100 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of compound (I). [0170] For example, the content of compound (I) in the combination agent of the present invention varies with the drug form of formulation. Generally, it is within the range from about 0.01 to 99.9 wt%, preferably from about 0.1 to 50 wt%, more preferably from about 0.5 to 20 wt%, relative to the entire amount of the formulation. [0171] The content of a concomitant drug in the combination agent of the present invention varies with the drug form of formulation. Generally it is within the range from about 0.01 to 99.9 wt%, preferably from about 0.1 to 50 wt%, more preferably from about 0.5 to 20 wt%, .relative to the entire amount of the formulation. [0172] The content of an additive such as carriers in the combination agent of the present invention varies with the drug form of formulation. Generally it is within the range from about 1 to 99.99 wt%, preferably from about 10 to 90 wt%, relative to the entire amount of the formulation. . [0173] When compound (I) and a concomitant drug are formulated independently, the same contents can be applied. [0174] Since the dosages may fluctuate under various conditions as mentioned above, a dosage less than the above-mentioned dosages may be sufficient or it may be necessary to administer at a dosage exceeding the range.
