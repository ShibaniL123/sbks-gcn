Portable Charging Case for a Vapour Dispenser Field of the Invention The present invention relates to the field of vapour dispensers, and more particularly to portable charging cases for vapour dispensers Background to the Invention Vapour dispensers are widely known and typically used to vaporise a liquid and deliver the vapour to a user. A vapour dispenser may also be known as an electronic smoking device, electronic vaping device, personal vaporiser, personal inhalation device, digital vapour device or electronic vapour system. Generally, vapour dispensers have a vaporisation chamber, which is typically a hollow tube containing electronics and a heating element known as an atomizer. A cartridge of liquid solution, known as vapour liquid or e-liquid, is attached to the vaporisation chamber. When the user activates the device, vapour liquid from the cartridge enters the vaporisation chamber where it is turned to vapour (e.g. “vaporised”) by the atomiser. The liquid solution may contain vegetable glycerine and/or polyethylene glycol, flavourings and nicotine, or may be a flavoured vapour which is nicotine free. It is widely known to use a vapour dispenser to simulate tobacco smoking by using the vapour dispenser to dispense vapour containing nicotine for example. A vapour dispenser used in this way may be referred to as an electronic cigarette, e-cig, e-cigarette or electronic nicotine delivery system. Typically, an electronic cigarette is a battery or rechargeable powered device which simulates tobacco smoking. Unlike alternative nicotine delivery devices, electronic cigarettes are often designed to simulate cigarettes, cigars or pipes in their use and/or appearance. For example, an electronic cigarette may be designed to be held in the same way as a cigarette, to activate when the user draws on the mouthpiece, or to simulate a flame with an LED which lights up when the user inhales. Alternatively, they may be designed to disguise their function as a cigarette. Electronic cigarettes are thought to have fewer toxic effects than traditional cigarettes as they do not rely on combustion to deliver nicotine to the lungs. In contrast, an electronic cigarette delivers nicotine to the lungs by heating the e-liquid to a vapour, which the user inhales. Vapour dispensers such as electronic cigarettes are typically portable and often have a rechargeable battery, which may be the largest component of an electronic cigarette. The battery may have an electronic airflow sensor whereby activation is triggered simply by drawing breath through the device. Other models include a power button which is switched on for operation of the electronic cigarette. An LED to indicate activation is sometimes provided. A portable charging case (PCC), also known as a recharge case, provides a means for recharging the battery of a vapour dispenser. The PCC contains a battery which stores a relatively large amount of energy to the battery of the vapour dispenser, and from which the vapour dispenser recharges. PCC may also store extra cartridges of vapour fluid which are inserted by the user into the electronic cigarette, to replace an empty cartridge. Summary of the Invention According to the invention, there is provided a device as claimed in the independent claim. In one aspect, there is thus provided a portable charging device for replenishing the vapour fluid of a vapour dispenser comprising: a fluid reservoir for storing multiple dosages of vapour liquid; and a refill mechanism, wherein the refill mechanism is configured to engage with the vapour dispenser to deliver a dose of fluid from the fluid reservoir to the vapour dispenser. Embodiments may therefore provide a recharge case for refuelling the vapour dispenser with single doses of vapour liquid. The vapour liquid may be supplied to the vapour dispenser from a tank [in the charging case] holding reserve of vapour liquid. A single dose of vapour liquid delivered to the vapour dispenser (and subsequently held in the liquid chamber within the vapour dispenser) may be equivalent to a single measure of substance (such as the quantum of nicotine inhaled in one ordinary cigarette, or the amount of caffeine in a single espresso, for example). The fluid reservoir in the charging case may store multiple dosages of vapour fluid, wherein the amount of fluid stored in a full fluid reservoir can be significantly greater than the fluid in a conventional cartridge or vial inserted into a conventional electronic cigarette. The invention may provide an advantage in that that a user is able to monitor use of the vapour dispenser in a similar way to if they were to consume a substance in a conventional manner. A single dose may therefore be equivalent to the amount of liquid required to simulate nicotine consumption equivalent to a tobacco cigarette. In an embodiment, the volume of vapour fluid stored in the fluid reservoir may be equivalent to the volume of vapour fluid required for an electronic cigarette to simulate a pack of tobacco cigarettes. Therefore, the user may be able to conveniently regulate their consumption of nicotine via the vapour dispenser. An additional advantage that may be provided by the invention is that the fluid reservoir may require less frequent replacement, and may therefore be less wasteful in comparison to the use of cartridges for conventional electronic cigarettes. The invention may provide a further advantage in that a user may find it difficult to refill the vapour dispenser using a cartridge for a conventional electronic cigarette, as such cartridges are typically relatively small compared to the size of the electronic cigarette. Further developments of the invention are the subject-matter of the dependent claims. Embodiments may therefore provide a rechargeable case battery wherein the portable charging case is adapted to allow the vapour dispenser to recharge its battery from the rechargeable case battery. Therefore, the portable charging case may offer the advantage that a user is able to simultaneously refill the vapour dispenser with vapour fluid and recharge the battery of the vapour dispenser. The portable charging case may comprise a vapour dispenser holder for housing the vapour dispenser. The holder may support the vapour dispenser in a specific position, provide storage, and enable refilling and charging of the vapour dispenser. The vapour dispenser holder may comprise a biasing means for receiving a vapour dispenser in a support position. The biasing means may be arranged such that depressing the vapour dispenser causes the biasing means to allow the vapour dispenser to engage with the refill mechanism, in a refill position. To refill the vapour dispenser with a dose of vapour liquid the vapour dispenser may be inserted into the holder. The holder may be a draw such that when the vapour dispenser is placed in the draw, pushing the vapour dispenser down allows the vapour dispenser to engage with the refill mechanism so that vapour liquid is pumped into the vapour dispenser, filling the liquid chamber of the vapour dispenser with one dose of vapour liquid. Alternatively, the vapour dispenser holder may be rotably connected to the portable charging case such that the vapour dispenser holder can move between an open and closed configuration, the open and closed positions having corresponding vapour dispenser positions, wherein in the closed configuration the vapour dispenser engages with the refill mechanism to receive a dose of fluid and in the open configuration the vapour dispenser is disengaged from the refill mechanism. The refill mechanism may comprise a pump. In such an example, interaction between the vapour dispenser and the refill mechanism may cause the pump to deliver a measured dose of vapour liquid to the vapour dispenser. The refill mechanism may comprise a refill valve. The refill mechanism may be electronically controlled. The portable charging device may comprise a counter for counting the number of times the vapour dispenser has been refilled from the fluid reservoir. The counter may be resettable and the portable charging case may display a value provided by the counter corresponding to the number of times the vapour dispenser has been refilled from the fluid reservoir. The value may be the number of times the vapour dispenser has been refilled from the fluid reservoir since the last time it was reset, or it may be the total number of times a dose of vapour liquid has been supplied by the fluid reservoir by the refill mechanism. Further, monitoring of usage may be used to determine when the vapour fluid in the fluid reservoir is nearly depleted and thus prompt the replacement of the fluid reservoir (by automatically ordering a replacement, or advising the user that a replacement will be needed, for example). Embodiments may be further adapted to vary the amount of vapour fluid in a single dose, and such variation may be based on prior usage of the vapour dispenser (as monitored by a counter for example). In this way, the amount of vapour fluid in a delivered dose may be gradually reduced over time, helping a user to reduce consumption of a substance in the vapour fluid (such as nicotine or caffeine, for example). Such a concept may be extended to enabling a user to indicate a time period over which they wish to reduce consumption and by how much. Based on such an indication, an embodiment may moderate the amount of vapour fluid in a single dose such that the desired reduction in consumption is achieved automatically. The fluid reservoir may be a liquid cartridge which is removable from the portable charging case such that it can be replaced. Therefore, when the fluid reservoir is depleted a user may insert a new liquid cartridge so that the fluid reservoir is replete. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a vapour dispenser. The vapour dispenser may comprise a liquid chamber for holding a dose of fluid, wherein the vapour dispenser is adapted to engage with the portable charging case in order to receive a dose of fluid from the fluid reservoir. The vapour dispenser may comprise a vapour dispenser valve. The vapour dispenser may be an electronic cigarette. Engagement of the vapour dispenser valve and refill valve may allow a dose of fluid to be pumped from the fluid reservoir of the portable charging case to the fluid chamber of the vapour dispenser. Therefore, when the vapour dispenser is in a refill position a dose of vapour liquid may be delivered to the vapour dispenser. When the vapour dispenser is not engaged with the refill mechanism, the vapour dispenser valve may be closed so that the vapour liquid is stored in the vapour dispenser. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a portable charging case substantially as described herein with reference to the accompanying figures. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a vapour dispenser substantially as described herein with reference to the accompanying figures. Brief Description of the Drawings Examples of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying diagrams, in which: FIG 1 is an exploded view of a portable charging case according to the invention; FIG 2 is a cross sectional view of the portable charging case of Figure 1, and an electronic cigarette for use with the portable charging case; FIG 3 shows the portable charging case of Figure 1, in use; FIG 4 is a detailed view of the interaction between the portable charging case of Figure 1 and an electronic cigarette; FIG 5 is a cross sectional view of the portable charging case of Figure 1, in use; FIG 6 is an electronic cigarette for use with the portable charging case of Figure 1 ; FIG 7 is an example of a portable charging case with side pairing to vapour dispenser; and FIG 8 is an example of a portable charging case with a top loading of vapour dispenser. Detailed Description of the Drawings Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a portable charging case 1 according to the invention. The portable charging case 1 houses a fluid reservoir 3 and a rechargeable case battery 5 both of which are removable and replaceable. The vapour dispenser holder 7 is shown in an open configuration and is adapted to store an electronic cigarette 9 or any other vapour dispenser. The vapour dispenser holder 7 in this embodiment is pivotally attached to the main body of the portable charging case 1 such that in a closed configuration the electronic cigarette 9 is stored within the casing of the portable charging case 1. In use, the electronic cigarette is placed in the electronic vapour dispenser holder 7 and the vapour dispenser holder 7 is moved to the closed configuration in order to store and/or refill the electronic cigarette 9. In the closed configuration, the electronic cigarette 9 is in a refill position and engages with the refill mechanism 15 to receive a dose of vapour fluid from the fluid reservoir 3. Alternatively, the electronic cigarette 9 may be refuelled upon insertion into the vapour dispenser holder 7. The electronic cigarette 9 may also recharge its internal battery from the recharge case 1. This offers a user an advantage, in that it is no longer necessary to carry multiple cartridges of vapour fluid in order to refill the electronic cigarette 9 with vapour fluid as this can be achieved directly from the portable charging case 1. Figure 2 shows an example of the portable charging case 1 in cross section, and an electronic cigarette 9 for use with the portable charging case 1. The liquid chamber of the electronic cigarette 9 is adapted to receive and store a single dose of cigarette fluid. The fluid reservoir 3 of the portable charging case 1 stores multiple doses of vapour fluid and is connected to a dosed pump 11. The pump seal 13 between the vapour dispenser holder 7 and the dosed pump 11 seals the refill mechanism 15 from the vapour dispenser holder 7. When the pump 11 is actuated, a dose of vapour fluid is delivered from the portable charging case 1 to the liquid chamber of the electronic cigarette 9. The electronic cigarette 9 is placed into the vapour dispenser holder 7 in a support position. In the support position, the electronic cigarette is disengaged from the refill mechanism. In an embodiment, a biasing member not shown prevents the electronic cigarette 9 from engaging with the refill mechanism 15 such that the electronic cigarette is in the support position. To actuate the pump 11, the electronic cigarette 9 is depressed. Depression of the electronic cigarette 9 overcomes the biasing force provided by the biasing member and enables the electronic cigarette 9 to move to a refill position. In the refill position, the electronic cigarette engages with the refill mechanism 15 to receive a dose of vapour liquid. A counter (not shown) monitors the number of doses dispensed by the refill mechanism 15 and displays the value to the user. The counter may display the number of doses dispensed by the refill mechanism 15 since the counter was last reset and/or may display the total number of doses the refill mechanism 15 has dispensed. This offers the user the advantage of having the opportunity to monitor their consumption. The counter may indicate to a user when the fluid reservoir 3 holds a lower volume than a threshold value (e.g. when the vapour fluid in the reservoir is nearly depleted). Detection that the amount of vapour fluid in the reservoir is below the threshold value may be used to prompt the replacement of the fluid reservoir, by automatically ordering the delivery of a replacement fluid reservoir for example. When the electronic cigarette 9 is in the vapour dispenser holder 7, cigarette charging contacts electrically connect the electronic cigarette 9 to the rechargeable case battery 5 so that the electronic cigarette 9 recharges its internal battery from the rechargeable case battery 5 of the portable recharge case 1. Figure 3 illustrates a further example of the portable charging case 1, in use. Here, the vapour dispenser holder 7 is rotably connected to the portable charging case 1, and swivels to an open configuration to accept the electronic cigarette 9. In order to refill the electronic cigarette 9 with cigarette fluid, the electronic cigarette 9 is placed into the vapour dispenser holder 7 when the vapour dispenser holder 7 is in the open configuration. The vapour dispenser holder 7 is then moved to a closed configuration. The position of the electronic cigarette 9 in the closed configuration is such that the electronic cigarette 9 engages with the refill mechanism 15 to receive a dose of vapour fluid. Figure 4 shows the interaction between the electronic cigarette 9 and the refill mechanism 15 in more detail. The refill mechanism 15 includes a refill valve 17 which engages with the electronic cigarette 9 when the electronic cigarette 9 is in the refill position. Pushing the cigarette down, into the refill position causes vapour fluid to be pumped from the fluid reservoir 3 to the electronic cigarette 9. In an example, the refill mechanism 15 is electronically controlled. For example, the pump 11 may be actuated or the refill valve 17 may open in response to a received signal. Figure 5 shows the electronic cigarette 9 stored in the portable charging case 1, in the refill position. When the vapour dispenser holder 7 is in the closed configuration, vapour fluid is pumped from the fluid reservoir 3 to the liquid chamber of the electronic cigarette 9 to refuel the electronic cigarette 9. Also, the electronic cigarette 9 may recharge its battery from the rechargeable case battery 5 of the portable charging case 1. Referring to Figure 6, there is shown an electronic cigarette 9 for use with the portable charging case 1. The electronic cigarette 9 has a liquid chamber for storing a dose of vapour liquid. The liquid chamber is connected to a vapour dispenser valve 19. When the electronic cigarette 9 engages with the refill mechanism 15 of the portable charging case 1, the vapour dispenser valve 19 opens to allow a dose of vapour fluid to enter the liquid chamber. When the electronic cigarette 9 is not engaged with the refill mechanism 15 the vapour dispenser valve 19 is closed so that the vapour liquid is stored in the liquid chamber. It will be appreciated that the portable charging case 1 is not limited in shape, and may not be rectangular. The refill mechanism 15 may not comprise a pump 11, and refilling of the electronic cigarette 9 with electronic cigarette fluid may be achieved by an alternative means. For example, referring now to Figures 7 and 8, there is shown modified embodiments wherein the vapour dispenser holder 7 is not rotatably connected to the portable charging case 1. More specifically, Figure 7 shows an embodiment wherein the vapour dispenser holder 70 is formed as a recess in the side the portable charging case 100. The recess is adapted to receive a vapour dispenser, such as an electronic cigarette 9 for example. Figure 8 shows an alternative embodiment wherein the vapour dispenser holder 170 is formed as a cylindrical barrel along the central longitudinal axis of the portable charging case 200. A vapour dispenser, such as an electronic cigarette 9 for example, may be placed into the vapour dispenser holder 170 in a support position (as depicted in Figure 8Α). In the support position, the vapour dispenser is disengaged from the refill mechanism. In an embodiment, a biasing member not shown prevents the vapour dispenser from engaging with the refill mechanism such that the vapour dispenser is in a support position. To actuate the refill mechanism of the portable charging case 200, the vapour dispenser is pushed further in to the vapour dispenser holder 170. Such further depression of the vapour dispenser overcomes a biasing force provided by a biasing member and enables the vapour dispenser to move to a refill position as depicted in Figure 8Β. In the refill position, the vapour dispenser engages with the refill mechanism to receive a dose of vapour liquid from the vapour fluid reservoir of the portable charging case 200. 1.
