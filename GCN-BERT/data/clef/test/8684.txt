A mixture of PETS (10.3 g, 13.6 mmol), 2,4-difluorophenol (6.2 g, 48 mmol), K2CO3 (9.4 g, 68 mmol), and dry DMF (25 mL) was heated at 110Â° C. for 22 h under nitrogen. Work-up similar to that of Compound F2, Purification by column chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate (5:1) as a mobile phase afforded Compound F3, 3-(2,4-difluorophenoxy)-2,2-bis((2,4-difluorophenoxy)methyl)propyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate, (3.2 g, 35% yield) as white solid.
