Title of Invention SOLUBLE COMPOSITION FOR TREATMENT OF HAIR AND SKIN CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to Swedish Patent Application Serial No. 1430042-0, the contents of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety. Technical Field This invention relates to a liquid-miscible composition for treatment of hair and scalp comprising a cleaning component. Background Art Hair is an important part of your beauty as it enhances the physical appearance of a person. However, most of us do not take hair care very seriously and as a result hair continues to get damaged and results in further problems such as hair loss, dandruff, brittle hair and other problems. We expose our hair to excessive chemicals from shampoos and other hair products. Blow dryers, irons, heaters and the like damage our hair's texture. Therefore, it is important to treat hair to repair the damage caused by these and other factors. There is a trend in the market to provide all natural products that are environmentally friendly and hypoallergenic. However, most shampoo, conditioner and other hair products on the market are not delivering truly chemical free products that are 100% friendly to environment and humans. Contrary to advertising today, shampoos do not feed, resuscitate, enliven or revive hair. They can't, simply because hair is not alive. It is a shaft of dead proteins such as keratin which also makes up our fingernails. Shampoos clean hair by removing of the thin layer of oily material known as sebum. Sebum is produced by sebaceous glands in the skin. It coats and protects the hair. Unfortunately, sebum also acts as a virtual magnet for dirt and residue from hair treatment products. Surfactants are found in almost all shampoos, are largely responsible for a product's cleaning and lathering properties. They also influence the hair's condition after shampooing. There are many kinds. Surfactants are molecules that have two sides with different properties. That is, their molecules are composed of a hydrophobic region, usually long chain hydrocarbons, and a hydrophilic region comprised of polar moieties. The hydrophobic region secures itself to oils such as sebum, while the hydrophilic region interacts with water. This acts much as an emulsifier. The surfactants tend to form micelles of oil covered in the surfactant with the polar region facing outward. These micelles are washed away with the water during rinsing. Lathering of a shampoo also is the result of the activity of surfactants. Foam is a gas dispersion in a liquid. To achieve this effect, the liquid's surface tension must be reduced so it no longer needs to minimize the surface area exposed to air. The water can stretch around the air bubble. There is no clear link between a surfactant's ability to clean and to produce foam. Indeed, very effective shampoos that do not lather well can be formulated. However, they do not sell well because consumers associate sudsing with cleaning The first commonly used surfactant was soap. Indeed, the first shampoos were just solutions of soap prepared from water, soap and soda (sodium carbonate) by British hairdressers during the heyday of the Empire on which the sun never set. They coined the word shampoo from "champo," a Hindi word meaning to massage or knead. These products cleaned as long as water had low mineral content. But when the water contained an appreciable amount of magnesium and calcium, the soap formed an insoluble precipitate deposited on the hair, resulting in a dull appearance. The advent of synthetic detergents, or "syndets," in the early part of this century solved this problem. Lauryl alcohol isolated from coconut fat or palm kernel oil was used to make sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which was a very effective cleaner, foamed well and did not form insoluble compounds with calcium or magnesium. It remains a mainstay of the industry but requires support from other surfactants. Sodium lauryl sulfate is an anionic surfactant, with its hydrophilic end negatively charged. It is a rather harsh detergent and removes sebum very effectively. Because sebum protects the hair from drying out and conditions its surface, using SLS alone as a surfactant would lead to dry, fly-away hair. SLS also can irritate eyes and skin. In addition, SLS is not very soluble in cold water and is not suitable making transparent shampoos. It dissolves readily at water temperatures normally used for shampooing so the problem of insolubility is more a cosmetic than a practical problem. Related compounds such as ammonium lauryl sulfate or triethanolamine lauryl sulfate are much more soluble and clean more gently. These are often are used in shampoos for dry or damaged hair. Sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) is highly soluble in water and it can be used to make clear shampoos. It has good cleaning and foaming properties but is more expensive to produce than SLS. Numerous other surfactants are available for use in shampoos. Cationic surfactants foam and clean very well but can hurt the eyes. They can, however, be used at low concentrations as conditioners. Their positive end is attracted to damaged parts of the hair, which tend to accumulate negative charges. Neutralization of the charges reduces static buildup. Another class of surfactants, known as non-ionics because they don't carry full-fledged electrical charges, are good cleaners but do not foam well. Amphoterics, which can behave as cationics or anionics depending on the pH of the solution, do not foam well either but are very gentle to eyes and skin. The classic shampoo ingredients have been subjected to various eye irritation tests over the years, and manufacturers have learned which detergents are least likely to cause trouble. Amphoterics are in this category and often are employed in "no tears" baby shampoos. Shampoos many other components. There are thickeners (xanthan gum), preservatives (parabens), emulsifiers (glycol distearate), color additives and foam boosters (cocamide monoethanolamine). Quaternary ammonium compounds, known as "quats," are added to shampoos to allow easy detangling when combing. These are the same compounds found in fabric softeners, and they cling to the hair's surface to produce a smooth finish. Panthenol can diffuse into the hair shaft and bind to proteins, strengthening their structure. Various proteins such as elastin and collagen or synthetic polymers often are added in the hope that they will bind to the hair's surface to enhance thickness. Most of these substances are rinsed away with the detergent. However, a residue, or buildup" may accumulate. This has resulted in introduction of specialty shampoos claiming to eliminate the social horror of limp, sticky and dull hair. All shampoos, no matter how gentle, face a common problem. As the protective sebum is stripped away, the outside layer of hair, the cuticle, is exposed. In healthy hair, the cuticle consists of translucent cells overlapping like shingles on a roof. In damaged hair, these shingles are more open and ragged. As the rough adjacent hairs rub against each other, transfer of electrons can produce a static electrical charge, causing fly-away hair. Shampoos can alleviate this by maintaining a pH between 5 and 8. It is therefore common for shampoos to include buffering agents such as citric acid. Humectants, which help to retain moisture, also are added. Examples are glycerol or propylene glycol, which is related to active ingredients in antifreeze. These form strong bonds to water and prevent it from evaporating. Silicones such as dimethicone are relatively non-greasy materials resembling sebum. They can coat the hair, add gloss and provide a smooth surface to ease combing. They also repair damaged areas and change hair's reflective properties, producing more shine. Balsam oil, from the tree of the same name, is chemically similar to sebum, and has been used in conditioners. Hyaluronic acid is also commonly used as a moisturizer. Alpha hydroxy acids are used to loosen adhesion between skin cells on the scalp and are helpful for people suffering from flaky, dry scalp associated with dandruff, psoriasis or eczema. They also happen to be good humectants and prevent hair from drying out. More unique or unusual ingredients may be added more for marketing than affect. These include thyme, jojoba oil, vitamin E or placenta extract is far more effective for marketing than for the hair.

Organic raw Camu camu powder: Carefully hand-picked and dried from the South American rainforest with no additives or fillers. Camu Camu berries are amazing superfruits that are said to contain more vitamin C than any other known botanical source. It is estimated to have 30 times more vitamin C than oranges along with calcium, amino acids & antioxidants . The Indigenous Amazonian people pick the Camu Camu berry (Myciaria dubia) in season, then dry and powder them, turning this purplish-red, cherry-like fruit to a light beige color. Camu camu fruits contain more vitamin C than any other plant in the world from 30 to 60 times more than an orange. They also contain amino acids including serine, valine, and leucine; and significant levels of beta carotene, calcium, iron, niacin, phosphorus, riboflavin, and thiamin. Camu camu also Reduces inflammation. Camu camu (Mycaria dubia) is a bush that grows in black water rivers, especially in those abandoned courses called "cochas", ecosystems of great social and economic importance for the Amazonian jungle of Peru. The fruit contains powerful phytochemicals with health benefits, including the amino acids serine, valine, and leucine, and more Vitamin C than any other known plant in the world. The camu-camu fruit is approximately 2 centimeters in diameter and has a purplish red skin with a yellow pulp. It has astringent, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, emollient and nutritional properties. Camu camu is being promoted as a product that untangles and strengthens hair, and protects it from external damage, adding to its shine and vitality. Camu camu is chock full of vitamin C: 60 times more per serving than an orange. Valine is an amino acid found in camu camu. It's an essential amino acid, meaning that we must get it in food because our bodies can't produce it. Valine is used by the body to prevent muscle breakdown and is important for nervous system and cognitive function. Our bodies need potassium for the proper functioning of the heart and kidneys. Camu camu is one way to get it: 71.1 milligrams are found in every 100 grams. Leucine is another essential amino acid found in camu camu, one that our bodies need for muscle and bone tissue growth and recovery and the production of growth hormones. Serine another amino acid! This one is key for digestion: serine helps to break down the bonds in proteins and polypeptides so they can be used by our bodies. Camu camu has several different flavonoids, which are compounds that are found in plants and are part of what gives fruits and vegetables their awesome colours. They mostly function in the body as antioxidants, neutralizing harmful free radicals. Gallic acid is found in camu camu, which is good news because it appears to have anti-fungal and anti- viral properties. It also acts as an antioxidant. Ellagic Acid is another acid with antioxidant properties, found in camu camu. It's been studied for anti-cancer effects, though research is still very early. Some research also indicates that ellagic acid has anti-diabetes effects.

Here are the intervals: Water Ratio may be preferably 100 ml of water for every 7.3011 grams of ingredient. Manufacturing A process in accordance with the principles of the invention provides sachets filled with the composition. The composition in the individually packaged sachets can, by mixing it with water, be used as a shampoo and condition 2 in 1 composition. A major advantage is that water does not need to be distilled and no preservatives need to be added to maintain freshness. The entire manufacturing process meets all required standards of quality and the main goal is not to contaminate the ingredients and maintain the microorganism count to a minimum. Since no water is added during the process the bacterial influence is minimal. The steps of the process include: 1 - Ingredients are found on the earth and are powdered and delivered to the production site in packages or bags ranging from 20 to 100 kilos. 2 - Upon arrival the ingredients are checked for their classifications such as organic and stored in a dry place. 3 - The first step of the process is to mix some of the powder ingredients together with the liquids and oils. Because different ingredients respond differently to water the following information is confidential and sensitive. We consider it part of our trade secret. The ingredients are Citric acid, slippery elm, vegemoist and rhassoul clay. Once these are mixed, the next step is to add all the oils and liquids to this mix. After blending is complete, we are left with a well-mixed composition still considered a powder. 4 - in a different containers you add and blend the other powder ingredients until the mix is well blended. 5 - In a larger container you add moth mixtures from step 3 and 4 and blend them together thoroughly. 3 - A special machine will fill each sachet. To further maintain high standards of quality the sachet will be filled one ingredient at a time. By doing this there is no need for any changes to each ingredients size. 4 - Each ingredient will be dropped into an individual funnel. 5 - Each funnel will have a measuring tip that will be set to the correct amount to dispense. 6 - As the cup or sachets travels down the moving belt each funnel will dispense the correct amount into it. 7 - There is a specific order to dispense based on what type of ingredient it is. Oil will be dispensed immediately after the clay. Lower density powders will be dispensed before the higher density powders. 8 - After the last funnel has dispensed, if the ingredients are all in the cup it will be dispensed into the sachet and the sachet will travel to the sealing mechanism. 9 - Sealing of the sachet is done without putting preservatives in a package, which is moisture, light and air tight. Each individualized sachet remains fresh and free from bacteria resulting in longer shelf life. Vibration of the machine and transportation provides sufficient mixing of the ingredients. Each sachet may be filled with 7-8 g of the ingredients, which is sufficient for one hair/scalp treatment. 1.
