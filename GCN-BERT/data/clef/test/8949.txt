FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new, distinct and stable hybrid of Guzmania hybrid, hereinafter referred to as ‘SKY’, as well as, plants and plant parts produced by these seeds which have all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of the Guzmania hybrid ‘SKY’. The present invention also relates to methods for producing these seeds and plants of the Guzmania hybrid ‘SKY’. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method of producing progeny Guzmania plants by crossing Guzmania ‘SKY’, as either the female or seed or male or pollen parent, with another Guzmania plant and selecting progeny. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new, distinct and stable hybrid of Guzmania hybrid, and hereinafter referred to by the variety denomination ‘SKY’. The new Guzmania ‘SKY’ originated from a cross made in a controlled breeding program by the inventors in 2010, and then first flowered in 2012, in Assendelft, The Netherlands. The female of seed parent is the Guzmania lingulata inbred line identified by code 88399 (unpatented). The male or pollen parent is the Guzmania lingulata inbred line identified by code 11056884 (unpatented). Guzmania is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. Guzmania is predominantly epiphytic with a few terrestrial species and is native to the tropics. For the most part, species vary in diameter from 7 or 8 inches to 3 or 4 feet and have rosettes of glossy, smooth-edged leaves. Floral bracts of Guzmania frequently have brilliant colors and may last for many months. The range of colors for Guzmania is generally from yellow through orange but may also include flame red and red-purple. White or yellow, tubular, three petaled flowers may also appear on a stem or within the leaf rosette but are usually short-lived. Guzmania may be advantageously grown as pot plants for greenhouse of home use. Typically, the plants are shaded from direct sunlight. During the spring to autumn period, the central vase-like part of the leaf rosette is normally filled with water. Guzmania is native to tropical America. Leaves of Guzmania are usually formed as basal rosettes which are stiff and entire and in several vertical ranks. Guzmania plants have terminal spikes or panicles which are often bracted with petals united in a tube about as long as the calyx. The ovary is superior and the seeds plumose. Asexual propagation of Guzmania is frequently performed by vegetative means through the use of tissue culture practices. Propagation of Guzmania can also be from offshoots which can be detached from the mother plant and grown in appropriate soil or bark mixture. Methods for cultivation and crossing of Guzmania are well known. For detailed discussion, reference is made to the following publications, which are incorporated herein by reference: Benzing, David H., THE BIOLOGY OF THE BROMELIADS, Mad River Press, Inc., Eureka (1980); Zimmer, Karl, BROMELIEN, Verlag, Paul Parey, Berlin (1986); and Rauh, Werner, BROMELIEN, Verlag Eugen Ulmer, Stuttgart (1981). A Guzmania inbred is produced by brother/sister crossing over several generations to produce a genetically homozygous plant selection. A hybrid cultivar is produced by crossing two genetically distinct inbred lines, collecting seeds produced by the cross, and germinating seeds so-produced to make hybrid plants. The hybrid seeds and plants produced by this method are uniform with respect their morphological and physiological characteristics. A need exists for a greater variety of Guzmania cultivars with attractive ornamental features. Additionally, a need exists for additional Guzmania hybrid cultivars that can be easily propagated be seed. The new Guzmania ‘SKY’ was developed through a controlled breeding program and exhibits unique, desirable and stable characteristics. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides Guzmania plant selections that are solid, small-sized, long-lasting hybrids with superior bract production and red inflorescence that exhibits good keeping quality. The present invention also provides Guzmania plant selections with a singular head inflorescence with a unique red color which distinguishes the new cultivar from typical Guzmania. These and other objectives have been achieved in accordance with the present invention which provides ‘SKY’ as a new Guzmania cultivar that is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventors, Elly Bak and Nico D. DM. Steur, in Assendelft, The Netherlands, in 2012. The female or seed parent is the Guzmania lingulata inbred line identified by code 88399 (unpatented). The male or pollen parent is the Guzmania lingulata inbred line identified by code 11056884 (unpatented). Both parental cultivars have a sufficient degree of homozygosity such that the progeny of the cross are genetypically and phenotypically uniform. The new hybrid ‘SKY’ therefore can be produced by sexual reproduction by crossing the parental inbred lines identified by codes 88399 and 11056884 to produce a population of progeny plants, each of which has the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new hybrid ‘SKY’. Seeds which are the hybrid ‘SKY’ are produced by crossing the parental inbred lines identified by the codes 88399 and 11056884, and are to be deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA 20110-2209.

DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The present invention was created by the inventors, Elly Bak and Nicolaas D. M. Steur in 2010, and flowered for the first time in 2012 in Assendelft, The Netherlands. This invention is directed to Guzmania plant having all the morphological and physiological characteristics of the hybrid ‘SKY’ produced from seeds which are the product of the cross of the Guzmania lingulata inbred line identified by code 88399 (unpatented as female of seed parent with the Guzmania lingulata inbred line identified by code 11056884 (unpatented) as the male or pollen parent. Both parents have a sufficient degree of homozygosity such that the progeny of the cross were, and continue to be, phenotypically uniform. The new hybrid ‘SKY’ can therefore be produced by sexual reproduction by crossing of the inbred selections identified by the codes 88399 and 11056884 to produce a population of progeny plants, each of which has the combination of characteristics herein disclosed for the new hybrid ‘SKY’. The new hybrid ‘SKY’ can also be produced by asexually reproducing progeny from the cross of the parental inbred lines identified by the codes 88399 and 11056884. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar by vegetative means by cuttings was first performed in 2012, in Assendelft, The Netherlands. The first ‘SKY’ plants propagated through the use of such cuttings flowered in 2013, in Assendelft, The Netherlands, and have demonstrated that the cultivar reproduces true-to-type and that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new cultivar are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of ‘SKY’ which in combination distinguish this Guzmania as a new and distinct cultivar: 1. Stemless growth habit;2. Funnel-form rosette plant, measuring about 20 to 25 cm in height (above the pot when flowering);3. Numerous, green color foliage (measuring about 25 to 30 cm in length and about 3 to3.5 cm in width.4. Superior floral bract production;5. Bracts are red in color (closest to RHS 46A),6. Singular head inflorescence, measuring about 8 cm in height, when flowering and about 18 cm in diameter7. Long-lasting habit. Of the many commercial cultivars known to the present inventors, the most similar in comparison to the new Guzmania hybrid ‘SKY’ is the Guzmania cultivar ‘TEMPO’. Plants of the new hybrid ‘SKY’ differ from plants of ‘TEMPO’ primarily in color of the inflorescence. Primary bracts of ‘SKY’ are red colored, closest to RHS 46A. Primary bracts of ‘TEMPO’ are red, closest to RHS 44A. ‘SKY’ has not been tested and observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype of the new cultivar may vary with variations in environment such as temperature, light intensity, frequency of fertilization, and composition of fertilizer, acetylene treatment, day length and humidity, without any change in the genotype of the plant. For example, substantial differences in plant height and diameter, number of leaves, can result depending on the size of he plant at the time that flowering is induced by flowering treatment. Since treatment to induce flowering disrupts normal watering and fertilization regimens. Flowering treatment of relatively smaller plants adversely affects the growth of the plant. The aforementioned photographs, together with the following observations, measurements and values describe the new Guzmania ‘SKY’ as grown in a greenhouse in Assendelft, The Netherlands, under conditions which closely approximate those generally used in commercial practice. Plants of ‘SKY’ were grown in a greenhouse with day temperatures ranging from 20° C. to 28° C. and night temperatures ranging from 18° C. to 23° C. No artificial lighting or photoperiodic treatments were conducted, but plants of ‘SKY’ are forced into flowering. The following fertilizer is added when growing plants of ‘SKY’: 1 part nitrogen, 0.6 parts phosphor, 2 parts Kalium and 0,1 parts magnesium. Color references are made to the Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart (RHS), 2001 edition, except where general colors of ordinary significance are used. Color values were taken under daylight conditions in a greenhouse I Assendelft, The Netherlands. The age of the plants of ‘SKY’ described is about 9 weeks after flowering treatment.
