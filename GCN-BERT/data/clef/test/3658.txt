The present invention provides template-fixed β-hairpin peptidomimetics incorporating template-fixed chains of 18 α-amino acid residues which, depending on their positions in the chains, are Gly, NMeGly, Pro or Pip, or of certain types, as defined hereinbelow. These template-fixed β-hairpin mimetics have CXCR4 antagonizing activity. In addition, the present invention provides an efficient synthetic process by which these compounds can, if desired, be made in parallel library-format. These β-hairpin peptidomimetics show improved efficacy, bioavailability, half-life and most importantly a significantly enhanced ratio between CXCR4 antagonizing activity on the one hand, and hemolysis on red blood cells and cytotoxicity on the other. To date the available therapies for the treatment of HIV infections have been leading to a remarkable improvement in symptoms and recovery from disease in infected people. Although the highly active anti retroviral therapy (HAART-therapy) which involves a combination of reverse transcriptase/proteaseinhibitor has dramatically improved the clinical treatment of individuals with AIDS or HIV infection there have still remained several serious problems including multi drug resistance, significant adverse effects and high costs. Particularly desired are anti HIV agents that block the HIV infection at an early stage of the infection, such as the viral entry. It has recently been recognized that for efficient entry into target cells, human immunodeficiency viruses require the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 as well as the primary receptor CD4 (N. Levy, Engl. J. Med., 335, 29, 1528-1530). Accordingly, an agent which could block the CXCR4 chemokine receptors should prevent infections in healthy individuals and slow or halt viral progression in infected patients (Science, 1997, 275, 1261-1264). Among the different types of CXCR4 inhibitors (M. Schwarz, T. N. C. Wells, A.E.I. Proudfoot, Receptors and Channels, 2001, 7, 417-428), one emerging class is based on naturally occurring cationic peptide analogues derived from Polyphemusin II which have an antiparallel β-sheet structure, and a β-hairpin that is maintained by two disulfide bridges (H. Nakashima, M. Masuda, T. Murakami, Y. Koyanagi, A. Matsumoto, N. Fujii, N. Yamamoto, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemoth. 1992, 36, 1249-1255; H. Tamamura, M. Kuroda, M. Masuda, A. Otaka, S. Funakoshi, H. Nakashima, N. Yamamoto, M. Waki, A. Matsumotu, J.M. Lancelin, D. Kohda, S. Tate, F. Inagaki, N. Fujii, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1993, 209, 1163; WO 95/10534 A1). Synthesis of structural analogs and structural studies by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have shown that the cationic peptides adopt well defined β-hairpins conformations, due to the constraining effect of the one ore two disulfide bridges (H. Tamamura, M. Sugioka, Y. Odagaki, A. Omagari, Y. Kahn, S. Oishi, H. Nakashima, N. Yamamoto, S.C. Peiper, N. Hamanaka, A. Otaka, N. Fujii, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001, 359-362). These results show that the β-hairpin structure plays an important role in CXCR4 antagonizing activity. Additional structural studies have also indicated that the antagonizing activity can also be influenced by modulating amphiphilic structure and the pharmacophore (H. Tamamura, A. Omagari, K. Hiramatsu,. K. Gotoh, T. Kanamoto, Y. Xu, E. Kodama, M. Matsuoka, T. Hattori, N. Yamamoto, H. Nakashima, A. Otaka, N. Fujii, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001, 11, 1897-1902; H. Tamamura, A. Omagari, K. Hiramatsu, S. Oishi, H. Habashita, T. Kanamoto, K. Gotoh, N. Yamamoto, H. Nakashima, A. Otaka N. Fujii, Bioorg. Med.Chem. 2002, 10, 1417-1426; H. Tamamura, K. Hiramatsu, K. Miyamoto, A. Omagari, S. Oishi, H. Nakashima, N. Yamamoto, Y. Kuroda, T. Nakagawa, A. Otaki, N. Fujii, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Letters 2002,12, 923-928). A key issue in the design of CXCR4 antagonizing peptides is selectivity. The polyphemusin II derived analogs exert still a cyto toxicity despite improvements (K. Matsuzaki, M. Fukui, N. Fujii, K. Miyajima, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1991, 259, 1070; A. Otaka, H. Tamamura, Y. Terakawa, M. Masuda, T. Koide, T. Murakami, H. Nakashima, K. Matsuzaki, K. Miyajima, T. Ibuka, M. Waki, A. Matsumoto, N. Yamamoto, N. Fujii Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1994, 17, 1669 and cited references above). This cytotoxic activity essentially obviates its use in vivo, and represents a serious disadvantage in clinical applications. Before intravenous use can be considered, the general toxicity, protein-binding activity in blood serum, as well as protease stability become serious issues which must be adequately addressed. Recently, it has been shown that the CXCR4-receptor is not only involved in the entry of HIV but also in the chemotactic activity of cancer cells, such as breast cancer metastasis or in metastasis of ovarian cancer (A. Muller, B. Homey, H. Soto, N. Ge, D. Catron, M.E. Buchanan, T. Mc Clanahan, E. Murphey, W. Yuan, S.N. Wagner, J. Luis Barrera, A. Mohar, E. Verastegui, A. Zlotnik, Nature 2001, 50, 410, J. M. Hall, K. S. Korach, Molecular Endocrinology, 2003, 1-47), Non-Hodgin's Lymphoma (F. Bertolini, C. DellAgnola, P. Manusco, C. Rabascio, A. Burlini, S. Monestiroli, A. Gobbi, G. Pruneri, G. Martinelli, Cancer Research 2002, 62, 3106-3112), or lung cancer (T. Kijima, G. Maulik, P. C. Ma, E. V. Tibaldi, R:E. Turner, B. Rollins, M. Sattler, B.E. Johnson, R. Salgia, Cancer Research 2002, 62, 6304-6311), melanoma, prostate cancer, kidney cancer, neuroblastomia, pancreatic cancer, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (H. Tamamura et al. Febs Letters 2003, 550 79-83, cited ref.) Blocking the chemotactic activity with a CXCR4 inhibitor should stop the migration of cancer cells. The CXCR4 receptor has also been implicated in the growth and proliferation of tumors. It was shown that activation of the CXCR4 receptor was critical for the growth of both malignant neuronal and glial tumors, and small cell lung tumors. Moreover, systemic administration of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 inhibits growth of intracranial glioblastoma and medulloblastoma xenografts by increasing apoptosis and decreasing the proliferation of tumor cells (Rubin JB, Kung AL, Klein RS, Chan JA, Sun Y, Schmidt K, Kieran MW, Luster AD, Segal RA. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003 100(23):13513-13518, Barbero S, Bonavia R, Bajetto A, Porcile C, Pirani P, Ravetti JL, Zona GL, Spaziante R, Florio T, Schettini G. Stromal Cancer Res. 2003,63(8):1969-1974, Kijima T, Maulik G, Ma PC, Tibaldi EV, Turner RE, Rollins B, Sattler M, Johnson BE, Salgia R. Cancer Res. 2002;62(21):6304-6311, Cancer Res. 2002;62(11):3106-3112. The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12/SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 are involved in trafficking of B cells and hematopoietic progenitors. It has been shown that the CXCR4 receptor plays an important role in the release of stem cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood. The receptor is for instance expressed on CD34+ cells, and has been implicated in the process of CD34+ cell migration and homing. This activity of the CXCR4 receptor could be very important for efficient apheresis collections of peripheral blood stem cell. Autologous peripheral blood cells provide a rapid and sustained hematopoietic recovery following autotransplantation after the administration of high-dose chemotherapy or radiotherapy in patients with haematological malignancies and solid tumors. (WC. Liles et al, Blood 2003, 102, 2728-2730). There is increasing evidence that suggests that chemokines in general and the interaction between the chemoattractant CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha and its receptor CXCR4 in particular play a pivotal role in angiogenesis. Chemokines induce angiogenesis directly by binding their cognate receptors on endothelial cells or indirectly by promoting inflammatory cell infiltrates, which deliver other angiogenic stimuli. A number of proinflammatory chemokines including interleukin 8 (IL-8), growth-regulated oncogene, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), eotaxin 1, and I-309 have been shown to act as direct inducers of angiogenesis. (Chen X, Beutler JA, McCloud TG, Loehfelm A, Yang L, Dong HF, Chertov OY, Salcedo R, Oppenheim JJ, Howard OM. Clin Cancer Res. 2003 9(8):3115-3123, Salcedo R, Oppenheim JJ. Microcirculation 2003 (3-4):359-370) It is well established that chemokines are involved in a number of inflammatory pathologies and some of them show a pivotal role in the modulation of osteoclast development. Immunostaining for SDF-1 (CXCL12) on synovial and bone tissue biopsies from both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) samples have revealed strong increases in the expression levels under inflammatory conditions. (Grassi F, Cristino S, Toneguzzi S, Piacentini A, Facchini A, Lisignoli G. J Cell Physiol. 2004;199(2):244-251. It seems likely that the CXCR4 receptor plays an important role in inflammatory diseases e.g. such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, or multiple sclerose (K.R. Shadidi et al, Scandinavian Journal of Immunolgy, 2003, 57, 192-198, J. A. Gonzalo J. Immunol. 2000, 165, 499-508, S. Hatse et al, FEBS Letters 2002 527, 255-262 and cited references). The mediation of recruitment of immune cells to sites of inflammation should be stopped by a CXCR4 inhibitor. In the compounds described below, a new strategy is introduced to stabilize beta-hairpin conformations in cyclic backbone-turn peptidomimetics exhibiting high CXCR4 antagonizing activity, being useful for efficient apheresis collections of peripheral blood stem cells, and having anticancer activity and anti inflammatory activity. This involves transplanting the cationic and hydrophobic hairpin sequence onto a template, whose function is to restrain the peptide loop backbone into a hairpin geometry. The rigidity of the hairpin may be further influenced by introducing a disulfide bridge. Template-bound hairpin mimetic peptides have been described in the literature (D, Obrecht, M. Altorfer, J. A. Robinson, Adv. Med. Chem. 1999, 4, 1-68; J. A. Robinson, Syn. Lett. 2000,4,429-441), but such molecules have not previously been evaluated for development of CXCR4 antagonizing peptides. However, the ability to generate β-hairpin peptidomimetics using combinatorial and parallel synthesis methods has now been established (L. Jiang, K. Moehle, B. Dhanapal, D. Obrecht, J. A. Robinson, Helv. Chim. Acta. 2000, 83, 3097-3112). These methods allow the synthesis and screening of large hairpin mimetic libraries, which in turn considerably facilitates structure-activity studies, and hence the discovery of new molecules with highly potent CXCR4 antagonizing activity or anti cancer activity or anti inflammatory activity and low hemolytic activity to human red blood cells. β-hairpin peptidomimetics obtained by the approach described here are useful as Anti-HIV agents, anticancer agents, as inhibitors of tumor growth or as apoptosis inducing agents, anti-metastasis agents, and anti inflammatory agents or as agents that can be used in apheresis collections of peripheral blood stem cells. The β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the present invention are compounds of the general formula wherein is Gly-DPro or Gly-LPro; and Z is a chain of 18 alpha-amino acid residues and the positions of said amino acid residues in said chain being counted starting from the N-terminal amino acid, whereby these amino acid residues are: P1: Arg;P2: Arg;P3: Trp;P4: Cys;P5: Tyr;P6: Arg;P7: Lys;P8: Cys;P9: Tyr;P10: Lys;P11: Gly;P12: Tyr;P13: Cys;P 14 residue is the residue of Tyr;P 15 residue is the residue of Arg;P16: Lys;P17: Cys;andP18: Arg; two Cys in P4 and P17 and/or as the P8 and P13 form a disulfide bridge; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In accordance with the present invention these β-hairpin peptidomimetics can be prepared by a process which comprises (a) coupling an appropriately functionalized solid support with an appropriately N-protected derivative of that amino acid which in the desired end-product is in position 8, 9 or 10, any functional group which may be present in said N-protected amino acid derivative being likewise appropriately protected;(b) removing the N-protecting group from the product thus obtained;(c) coupling the product thus obtained with an appropriately N-protected derivative of that amino acid which in the desired end-product is one position nearer the N-terminal amino acid residue, any functional group which may be present in said N-protected amino acid derivative being likewise appropriately protected;(d) removing the N-protecting group from the product thus obtained;(e) repeating steps (c) and (d) until the N-terminal amino acid residue has been introduced;(f) coupling the product thus obtained with a compound of the general formula wherein is as defined above and X is an N-protecting group(g) removing the N-protecting group from the product obtained in step (f);(h) coupling the product thus obtained with an appropriately N-protected derivative of that amino acid which in the desired end-product is in position 18, any functional group which may be present in said N-protected amino acid derivative being likewise appropriately protected;(i) removing the N-protecting group from the product thus obtained;(j) coupling the product thus obtained with an appropriately N-protected derivative of that amino acid which in the desired end-product is one position farther away from position 18, any functional group which may be present in said N-protected amino acid derivative being likewise appropriately protected;(k) removing the N-protecting group from the product thus obtained;(l) repeating steps (j) and (k) until all amino acid residues have been introduced;(m) if desired, selectively deprotecting one or several protected functional group(s) present in the molecule and appropriately substituting the reactive group(s) thus liberated;(n) if desired, forming one, two or three interstrand linkage(s) between side-chains of appropriate amino acid residues at opposite positions of the β-strand region;(o) detaching the product thus obtained from the solid support;(p) cyclizing the product cleaved from the solid support;(q) removing any protecting groups present on functional groups of any members of the chain of amino acid residues and, if desired, any protecting group(s) which may in addition be present in the molecule; and(r) if desired, converting the product thus obtained into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or converting a pharmaceutically acceptable, or unacceptable, salt thus obtained into the corresponding free compound of formula I or into a different, pharmaceutically acceptable, salt. Alternatively, the peptidomimetics of the present invention can be prepared by (a') coupling an appropriately functionalized solid support with a compound of the general formula wherein is as defined above and X is an N-protecting group(b') removing the N-protecting group from the product obtained in step (a');(c') coupling the product thus obtained with an appropriately N-protected derivative of that amino acid which in the desired end-product is in position 18, any functional group which may be present in said N-protected amino acid derivative being likewise appropriately protected;(d') removing the N-protecting group from the product thus obtained;(e') coupling the product thus obtained with an appropriately N-protected derivative of that amino acid which in the desired end-product is one position farther away from position 18, any functional group which may be present in said N-protected amino acid derivative being likewise appropriately protected;(f) removing the N-protecting group from the product thus obtained;(g') repeating steps (e') and (f) until all amino acid residues have been introduced;(h') if desired, selectively deprotecting one or several protected functional group(s) present in the molecule and appropriately substituting the reactive group(s) thus liberated;(i') if desired forming one, two or three interstrand linkage(s) between side-chains of appropriate amino acid residues at opposite positions of the β-strand region;(j') detaching the product thus obtained from the solid support;(k') cyclizing the product cleaved from the solid support;(l') removing any protecting groups present on functional groups of any members of the chain of amino acid residues and, if desired, any protecting group(s) which may in addition be present in the molecule; and(m') if desired, converting the product thus obtained into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or converting a pharmaceutically acceptable, or unacceptable, salt thus obtained into the corresponding free compound of formula I or into a different, pharmaceutically acceptable, salt. Introducing an amino acid residue of type I can, alternatively, be effected by coupling with a leaving group-containing acylating agent, such as bromo, chloro or iodo acetic acid, followed by nucleophilic displacement with an amine of the formula H2N-R86 which, if necessary, is appropriately protected. The peptidomimetics of the present invention can also be enantiomers of the compounds of formula I. These enantiomers can be prepared by a modification of the above processes in which enantiomers of all chiral starting materials are used. As used in this description, the term "alkyl", taken alone or in combinations, designates saturated, straight-chain or branched hydrocarbon radicals having up to 24, preferably up to 12, carbon atoms. Similarly, the term "alkenyl" designates straight chain or branched hydrocarbon radicals having up to 24, preferably up to 12, carbon atoms and containing at least one or, depending on the chain length, up to four olefinic double bonds. The term "lower" designates radicals and compounds having up to 6 carbon atoms. Thus, for example, the term "lower alkyl" designates saturated, straight-chain or branched hydrocarbon radicals having up to 6 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec.-butyl, isobutyl, tert.-butyl and the like. The term "aryl" designates aromatic carbocyclic hydrocarbon radicals containing one or two six-membered rings, such as phenyl or naphthyl, which may be substituted by up to three substituents such as Br, Cl, F, CF3, NO2, lower alkyl or lower alkenyl. The term "heteroaryl" designates aromatic heterocyclic radicals containing one or two five- and/or six-membered rings, at least one of them containing up to three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, S and N and said ring(s) being optionally substituted; representative examples of such optionally substituted heteroaryl radicals are indicated hereinabove in connection with the definition of R77. The template Gly-DPro constitutes a building block which has an N-terminus and a C-terminus oriented in space in such a way that the distance between those two groups may lie between 4.0-5.5A. A peptide chain Z is linked to the C-terminus and the N-terminus of the template Gly-DPro via the corresponding N- and C-termini so that the template and the chain form a cyclic structure such as that depicted in formula I. In a case as here where the distance between the N- and C- termini of the template lies between 4.0-5.5A the template will induce the H-bond network necessary for the formation of a β-hairpin conformation in the peptide chain Z. Thus template and peptide chain form a β-hairpin mimetic. The β-hairpin conformation is highly relevant for the CXCR4 antagonizing activity of the P-hairpin mimetics of the present invention. The β-hairpin stabilizing conformational properties of the template Gly-DPro play a key role not only for the selective CXCR4 antagonizing activity but also for the synthesis process defined hereinabove, as incorporation of the templates at the beginning or near the middle of the linear protected peptide precursors enhances cyclization yields significantly.

Such interstrand linkages are known to stabilize the β-hairpin conformations and thus constitute an important structural element for the design of β-hairpin mimetics. Most preferred amino acid residues in chain Z are those derived from natural α-amino acids.

The positions P1 to P18 of each amino acid residue in the chain Z are unequivocally defined as follows: P1 represents the first amino acid in the chain Z that is coupled with its N-terminus to the C-terminus of the template Gly-DPro ; and P18 represents the last amino acid in the chain Z that is coupled with its C-terminus to the N-terminus of the template Gly-DPro. The α-amino acid residues in posizions 1 to 18 are most preferably: P1: Arg;P2: Arg;P3: 2-Nal, Trp, Tyr;P4: Cys;P5: Tyr;P6: Cit, Gln. Arg;P7: Lys;P8: Cys, Gly;P9: Tyr;P10: Lys, DLys, DPro;P11: Gly, Pro, DPro;P12: Tyr;P13: Cys, Gly;P14: Tyr;P15: Arg;P16: Cit, Thr, Lys; - P17: Cys; andP18: Arg; orCys at P4 and P17 and/or at P8 and P13 form a disulfide bridge. Particularly preferred β-peptidomimetics of the invention include those described in Example 160. The processes of the invention can advantageously be carried out as parallel array syntheses to yield libraries of template-fixed β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the above general formula I. Such parallel syntheses allow one to obtain arrays of numerous (normally 24 to 192, typically 96) compounds of general formula I in high yields and defined purities, minimizing the formation of dimeric and polymeric by-products. The proper choice of the functionalized solid-support (i.e. solid support plus linker molecule), templates and site of cyclization play thereby key roles. The functionalized solid support is conveniently derived from polystyrene crosslinked with, preferably 1-5%, divinylbenzene; polystyrene coated with polyethyleneglycol spacers (TentagelR); and polyacrylamide resins (see also Obrecht, D.; Villalgordo, J.-M, "Solid-Supported Combinatorial and Parallel Synthesis of Small-Molecular-Weight Compound Libraries", Tetrahedron Organic Chemistry Series, Vol. 17, Pergamon, Elsevier Science, 1998). The solid support is functionalized by means of a linker, i.e. a bifunctional spacer molecule which contains on one end an anchoring group for attachment to the solid support and on the other end a selectively cleavable functional group used for the subsequent chemical transformations and cleavage procedures. For the purposes of the present invention two types of linkers are used: Type 1 linkers are designed to release the amide group under acid conditions (Rink H, Tetrahedron Lett. 1987,28, 3783-3790). Linkers of this kind form amides of the carboxyl group of the amino acids; examples of resins functionalized by such linker structures include 4-[(((2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxyacetamido) aminomethyl] PS resin, 4-[(((2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxyacetamido) aminomethyl] -4-methylbenzydrylamine PS resin (Rink amide MBHA PS Resin), and 4-[(((2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxyacetamido) aminomethyl] benzhydrylamine PS-resin (Rink amide BHA PS resin). Preferably, the support is derived from polystyrene crosslinked with, most preferably 1-5%, divinylbenzene and functionalized by means of the 4-(((2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxyacetamido) linker.Type 2 linkers are designed to eventually release the carboxyl group under acidic conditions. Linkers of this kind form acid-labile esters with the carboxyl group of the amino acids, usually acid-labile benzyl, benzhydryl and trityl esters; examples of such linker structures include 2-methoxy-4-hydroxymethylphenoxy (SasrinR linker), 4-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl-hydroxymethyl)-phenoxy (Rink linker), 4-(4-hydroxymethyl-3-methoxyphenoxy)butyric acid (HMPB linker), trityl and 2-chlorotrityl. Preferably, the support is derived from polystyrene crosslinked with, most preferably 1-5%, divinylbenzene and functionalized by means of the 2-chlorotrityl linker. When carried out as a parallel array syntheses the processes of the invention can be advantageously carried out as described herein below but it will be immediately apparent to those skilled in the art how these procedures will have to be modified in case it is desired to synthesize one single compound of the above formula I. A number of reaction vessels (normally 24 to 192, typically 96) equal to the total number of compounds to be synthesized by the parallel method are loaded with 25 to 1000 mg, preferably 100 mg, of the appropriate functionalized solid support, preferably 1 to 3% cross-linked polystyrene or Tentagel resin. The solvent to be used must be capable of swelling the resin and includes, but is not limited to, dichloromethane (DCM), dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dioxane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethanol (EtOH), trifluoroethanol (TFE), isopropylalcohol and the like. Solvent mixtures containing as at least one component a polar solvent (e. g. 20% TFE/DCM, 35% THF/NMP) are beneficial for ensuring high reactivity and solvation of the resin-bound peptide chains (Fields, G. B., Fields, C. G., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 4202-4207). With the development of various linkers that release the C-terminal carboxylic acid group under mild acidic conditions, not affecting acid-labile groups protecting functional groups in the side chain(s), considerable progresses have been made in the synthesis of protected peptide fragments. The 2-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzylalcohol-derived linker (SasrinR linker, Mergler et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1988, 29 4005-4008) is cleavable with diluted trifluoroacetic acid (0.5-1% TFA in DCM) and is stable to Fmoc deprotection conditions during the peptide synthesis, Boc/tBu-based additional protecting groups being compatible with this protection scheme. Other linkers which are suitable for the process of the invention include the super acid labile 4-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl-hydroxymethyl)-phenoxy linker (Rink linker, Rink, H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1987, 28, 3787-3790), where the removal of the peptide requires 10% acetic acid in DCM or 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in DCM; the 4-(4-hydroxymethyl-3-methoxyphenoxy)butyric acid-derived linker (HMPB-linker, Flörsheimer & Riniker, Peptides 1991,1990 131) which is also cleaved with 1%TFA/DCM in order to yield a peptide fragment containing all acid labile side- chain protective groups; and, in addition, the 2-chlorotritylchloride linker (Barlos et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 30, 3943-3946), which allows the peptide detachment using a mixture of glacial acetic acid/trifluoroethanol/DCM (1:2:7) for 30 min. Suitable protecting groups for amino acids and, respectively, for their residues are, for example, for the amino group (as is present e. g. also in the side-chain of lysine) CbzbenzyloxycarbonylBoctert.-butyloxycarbonylFmoc9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonylAllocallyloxycarbonylTeoctrimethylsilylethoxycarbonylTcctrichloroethoxycarbonylNpso-nitrophenylsulfonyl;Trttriphenymethyl or tritylfor the carboxyl group (as is present e. g. also in the side-chain of aspartic and glutamic acid) by conversion into esters with the alcohol components tButert.-butylBnbenzylMemethylPhphenylPacPhenacyl AllylTsetrimethylsilylethylTcetrichloroethyl;for the guanidino group (as is present e. g. in the side-chain of arginine) Pmc2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonylTstosyl (i. e. p-toluenesulfonyl)CbzbenzyloxycarbonylPbfpentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonylfor the hydroxy group (as is present e. g. in the side-chain of threonine and serine) tButert.-butylBnbenzylTrttrityland for the mercapto group (as is present e. g. in the side-chain of cysteine) AcmacetamidomethyltButert.-butylBnbenzylTrttritylMtr4-methoxytrityl. The 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl- (Fmoc)-protected amino acid derivatives are preferably used as the building blocks for the construction of the template-fixed β-hairpin loop mimetics of formula I. For the deprotection, i. e. cleaving off of the Fmoc group, 20% piperidine in DMF or 2% DBU/2% piperidine in DMF can be used. N-substituted glycine derivatives (type I) used as building blocks for the construction of certain compounds of formula I are derived from 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl- (Fmoc)-protected amino acid derivatives or, alternatively, built up in two steps from leaving group-containing glycine precursors, such as bromo, chloro or iodo acetic acid, and suitable primary amine building blocks NH2-R86. The first synthesis step consists of the attachment of the leaving group-containing acetylating agent, such as bromo acetic acid, to the resin bound intermediate through formation of the amide bond. The second reaction step - the nucleophilic displacement - is accomplished using the primary amine building blocks, wherein the residues are, if necessary, suitably protected with groups as described above for side chains of amino acids. For the incorporation of the N-substituted glycine derivatives as building blocks into the template-fixed β-hairpin loop mimetics the general synthesis procedure for assembling the hairpin mimetics is used as described herein. The quantity of the reactant, i. e. of the amino acid derivative, is usually 1 to 20 equivalents based on the milliequivalents per gram (meq/g) loading of the functionalized solid support (typically 0.1 to 2.85 meq/g for polystyrene resins) originally weighed into the reaction tube. Additional equivalents of reactants can be used, if required, to drive the reaction to completion in a reasonable time. The reaction tubes, in combination with the holder block and the manifold, are reinserted into the reservoir block and the apparatus is fastened together. Gas flow through the manifold is initiated to provide a controlled environment, for example, nitrogen, argon, air and the like. The gas flow may also be heated or chilled prior to flow through the manifold. Heating or cooling of the reaction wells is achieved by heating the reaction block or cooling externally with isopropanol/dry ice and the like to bring about the desired synthetic reactions. Agitation is achieved by shaking or magnetic stirring (within the reaction tube). The preferred workstations (without, however, being limited thereto) are Labsource's Combi-chem station and MultiSyn Tech's-Syro synthesizer. Amide bond formation requires the activation of the α-carboxyl group for the acylation step. When this activation is being carried out by means of the commonly used carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, Sheehan & Hess, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955, 77, 1067-1068) or diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC, Sarantakis et al Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.1976, 73, 336-342), the resulting dicyclohexylurea and diisopropylurea is insoluble and, respectively, soluble in the solvents generally used. In a variation of the carbodiimide method 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt, König & Geiger, Chem. Ber 1970, 103, 788-798) is included as an additive to the coupling mixture. HOBt prevents dehydration, suppresses racemization of the activated amino acids and acts as a catalyst to improve the sluggish coupling reactions. Certain phosphonium reagents have been used as direct coupling reagents, such as benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP, Castro et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1975, 14, 1219-1222; Synthesis, 1976, 751-752), or benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexaflurophoshate (Py-BOP, Coste et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1990, 31, 205-208), or 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl-)1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium terafluoroborate (TBTU), or hexafluorophosphate (HBTU, Knorr et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 30, 1927-1930); these phosphonium reagents are also suitable for in situ formation of HOBt esters with the protected amino acid derivatives. More recently diphenoxyphosphoryl azide (DPPA) or O-(7-aza-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU) or O-(7-aza-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU)/7-aza-1-hydroxy benzotriazole (HOAt, Carpino et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1994, 35, 2279-2281) have also been used as coupling reagents. Due to the fact that near-quantitative coupling reactions are essential, it is desirable to have experimental evidence for completion of the reactions. The ninhydrin test (Kaiser et al., Anal. Biochemistry 1970, 34, 595), where a positive colorimetric response to an aliquot of resin-bound peptide indicates qualitatively the presence of the primary amine, can easily and quickly be performed after each coupling step. Fmoc chemistry allows the spectrophotometric detection of the Fmoc chromophore when it is released with the base (Meienhofer et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1979, 13, 35-42). The resin-bound intermediate within each reaction tube is washed free of excess of retained reagents, of solvents, and of by-products by repetitive exposure to pure solvent(s) by one of the two following methods: 1) The reaction wells are filled with solvent (preferably 5 ml), the reaction tubes, in combination with the holder block and manifold, are immersed and agitated for 5 to 300 minutes, preferably 15 minutes, and drained by gravity followed by gas pressure applied through the manifold inlet (while closing the outlet) to expel the solvent;2) The manifold is removed from the holder block, aliquots of solvent (preferably 5 ml) are dispensed through the top of the reaction tubes and drained by gravity through a filter into a receiving vessel such as a test tube or vial. Both of the above washing procedures are repeated up to about 50 times (preferably about 10 times), monitoring the efficiency of reagent, solvent, and by-product removal by methods such as TLC, GC, or inspection of the washings. The above described procedure of reacting the resin-bound compound with reagents within the reaction wells followed by removal of excess reagents, by-products, and solvents is repeated with each successive transformation until the final resin-bound fully protected linear peptide has been obtained. Before this fully protected linear peptide is detached from the solid support, it is possible, if desired, to selectively deprotect one or several protected functional group(s) present in the molecule and to appropriately substitute the reactive group(s) thus liberated. To this effect, the functional group(s) in question must initially be protected by a protecting group which can be selectively removed without affecting the remaining protecting groups present. Alloc (allyloxycarbonyl) is an example for such an amino protecting group for which can be selectively removed, e.g. by means of Pd° and phenylsilane in CH2Cl2, without affecting the remaining protecting groups, such as Fmoc, present in the molecule. The reactive group thus liberated can then be treated with an agent suitable for introducing the desired substituent. Thus, for example, an amino group can be acylated by means of an acylating agent corresponding to the acyl substituent to be introduced. For the formation of the pegylated amino acids such as IPegK, or SPegK, preferably a solution of 5 equivalents of HATU (N-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ylmethylene]-N-methylinethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide) in dry DMF and a solution of 10 equivalents of DIPEA (Diisopropyl ethaylamine) in dry DMF and 5 equivalents of 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy] acetic acid (lPeg) and, respectively, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid (sPeg), is applied to the liberated amino group of the appropiate amino acid side chain for 3 h. The procedure is thereafter repeated for another 3h with a fresh solution of reagents after filtering and washing the resin. Before this fully protected linear peptide is detached from the solid support, it is also possible, if desired, to form (an) interstrand linkage(s) between side-chains of appropriate amino acid residues at opposite positions of the β-strand region. Interstrand linkages and their formation have been discussed above, in connection with the explanations made regarding groups of the type H which can, for example, be disulfide bridges formed by cysteine and homocysteine residues at opposite positions of the β-strand; or lactam bridges formed by glutamic and aspartic acid residues linking ornithine and, respectively, lysine residues, or by glutamic acid residues linking 2,4-diaminobutyric acid residues located at opposite β-strand positions by amide bond formation. The formation of such interstrand linkages can be effected by methods well known in the art. For the formation of disulfide bridges preferably a solution of 10 equivalents of iodine solution is applied in DMF or in a mixture of CH2Cl2 /MeOH for 1.5 h which is repeated is repeated for another 3h with a fresh iodine solution after filtering of the iodine solution, or in a mixture of DMSO and acetic acid solution, buffered with 5% with NaHCO3 to pH 5-6 for 4h, or in water after adjusted to pH 8 with ammonium hydroxide solution by stirring for 24h, or in a solution of NMP and tri-n- butylphosphine (preferably 50 eq.). For the formation of lactam bridges preferably a solution of 2 equivalents of HATU (N-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ylmethylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide) in dry DMF and a solution of 4 equivalents of DIPEA (Diisopropyl ethaylamine) in dry DMF is applied for 16 h. Detachment of the fully protected linear peptide from the solid support is achieved by immersion of the reaction tubes, in combination with the holder block and manifold, in reaction wells containing a solution of the cleavage reagent (preferably 3 to 5 ml). Gas flow, temperature control, agitation, and reaction monitoring are implemented as described above and as desired to effect the detachment reaction. The reaction tubes, in combination with the holder block and manifold, are disassembled from the reservoir block and raised above the solution level but below the upper lip of the reaction wells, and gas pressure is applied through the manifold inlet (while closing the outlet) to efficiently expel the final product solution into the reservoir wells. The resin remaining in the reaction tubes is then washed 2 to 5 times as above with 3 to 5 ml of an appropriate solvent to extract (wash out) as much of the detached product as possible. The product solutions thus obtained are combined, taking care to avoid cross-mixing. The individual solutions/extracts are then manipulated as needed to isolate the final compounds. Typical manipulations include, but are not limited to, evaporation, concentration, liquid/liquid extraction, acidification, basification, neutralization or additional reactions in solution. The solutions containing fully protected linear peptide derivatives which have been cleaved off from the solid support and neutralized with a base, are evaporated. Cyclization is then effected in solution using solvents such as DCM, DMF, dioxane, THF and the like. Various coupling reagents which were mentioned earlier can be used for the cyclization. The duration of the cyclization is about 6-48 hours, preferably about 16 hours. The progress of the reaction is followed, e. g. by RP-HPLC (Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography). Then the solvent is removed by evaporation, the fully protected cyclic peptide derivative is dissolved in a solvent which is not miscible with water, such as DCM, and the solution is extracted with water or a mixture of water-miscible solvents, in order to remove any excess of the coupling reagent. Alternatively the detachment and complete deprotection of the fully protected peptide from the solid support can be achieved manually in glass vessels. Finally, the fully protected peptide derivative is treated with 95% TFA, 2.5% H2O, 2.5% TIS or another combination of scavengers for effecting the cleavage of protecting groups. The cleavage reaction time is commonly 30 minutes to 12 hours, preferably about 2.5 hours. The volatiles are evaporated to dryness and the crude peptide is dissolved in 20% AcOH in water and extracted with isopropyl ether or other solvents which are suitable therefor. The aqueous layer is collected and evaporated to dryness, and the fully deprotected cyclic peptide derivative of formula I is obtained as end-product. Depending on its purity, this peptide derivative can be used directly for biological assays, or it has to be further purified, for example by preparative HPLC. As mentioned earlier, it is thereafter possible, if desired, to convert a fully deprotected product of formula I thus obtained into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or to convert a pharmaceutically acceptable, or unacceptable, salt thus obtained into the corresponding free compound of formula I or into a different, pharmaceutically acceptable, salt. Any of these operations can be carried out by methods well known in the art. The template starting materials of formula II used in the processes of the invention, pre-starting materials therefor, and the preparation of these starting and pre-starting materials are described in International Application PCT/EP02/01711 of the same applicants, published as WO 02/070547 A1. The starting materials of formula H2NR86 are known or can be prepared by methods which are well known in the art. The β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention can be used in a wide range of applications in order to prevent HIV infections in healthy individuals and slow or halt viral progression in infected patients, or where cancer is mediated or resulting from the CXCR4 receptor activity, or where immunological diseases are mediated or resulting from CXCR4 receptor activity, or the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention can be used to treat immuno supressission, or they can be used during apheresis collections of peripheral blood stem cells. The β-hairpin peptidomimetics may be administered per se or may be applied as an appropriate formulation together with carriers, diluents or excipients well known in the art. When used to treat or prevent HIV infections or cancer such as breast cancer, brain cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer, neuroblastoma, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, chronic lyphomphocytic leukemia, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, angiogenesis, and haematopoetic tissues; or inflammatory disorders such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonias, delayed-type hypersensitivity, interstitial lung diseas (ILD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, ILD associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing sponylitis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, juvenile onset diabetes, glomerulonephritis, autoimmune throiditis, graft rejection, including allograft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, inflammatory dermatoses; or to treat immunosuppression, including immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy, radiation therapy or graft/transplantation rejection, the β-hairpin peptidomimetics can be administered singly, as mixtures of several β-hairpin peptidomimetics, in combination with other anti-HIV agents, or antimicrobial agents or anti cancer agents or anti-inflammatory agents, or in combination with other pharmaceutically active agents. The β-hairpin peptidomimetics can be administered per se or as pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention may be manufactured by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, coated tablet-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or auxilliaries which facilitate processing of the active β-hairpin peptidomimetics into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation depends upon the method of administration chosen. For topical administration the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention may be formulated as solutions, gels, ointments, creams, suspensions, etc. as are well-known in the art. Systemic formulations include those designed for administration by injection, e.g. subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal or intraperitoneal injection, as well as those designed for transdermal, transmucosal, oral or pulmonary administration. For injections, the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention may be formulated in adequate solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hink's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. The solutions may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention may be in powder form for combination with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation as known in the art. For oral administration, the compounds can be readily formulated by combining the active β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions etc., for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. For oral formulations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets, suitable excipients include fillers such as sugars, such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol and sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP); granulating agents; and binding agents. If desired, desintegrating agents may be added, such as cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidones, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. If desired, solid dosage forms may be sugar-coated or enteric-coated using standard techniques. For oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers, excipients or diluents include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, etc. In addition, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like may be added. For buccal administration, the composition may take the form of tablets, lozenges, etc. formulated as usual. For administration by inhalation, the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention are conveniently delivered in form of an aeorosol spray from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluromethane, carbon dioxide or another suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dose unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The compounds may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as suppositories together with appropriate suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. In addition to the formulations described previously, the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (e.g. subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. For the manufacture of such depot preparations the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (e.g. as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble salts. In addition, other pharmaceutical delivery systems may be employed such as liposomes and emulsions well known in the art. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide may also be employed. Additionally, the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic agent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed. As the β-hairpin pepdidomimetics of the invention may contain charged residues, they may be included in any of the above-described formulations as such or as pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous and other protic solvents than are the corresponding free forms. The β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention, or compositions thereof, will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose. It is to be understood that the amount used will depend on a particular application. For topical administration to treat or prevent HIV infections a therapeutically effective dose can be determined using, for example, the in vitro assays provided in the examples. The treatment may be applied while the HIV infection is visible, or even when it is not visible. An ordinary skilled expert will be able to determine therapeutically effective amounts to treat topical HIV infections without undue experimentation. For systemic administration, a therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from in vitro assays. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating β-hairpin peptidomimetic concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined in the cell culture (i.e. the concentration of a test compound that is lethal to 50% of a cell culture). Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Initial dosages can also be determined from in vivo data, e.g. animal models, using techniques that are well known in the art. One having ordinary skill in the art could readily optimize administration to humans based on animal data. Dosage amounts for applications as anti-HIV agents may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention which are sufficient to maintain the therapeutic effect. Therapeutically effective serum levels may be achieved by administering multiple doses each day. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention may not be related to plasma concentration. One having the ordinary skill in the art will be able to optimize therapeutically effective local dosages without undue experimentation. The amount of β-hairpin peptidomimetics administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgement of the prescribing physician. The anti-HIV therapy may be repeated intermittently while infections are detectable or even when they are not detectable. The therapy may be provided alone or in combination with other drugs, such as for example other anti-HIV agents or anti cancer agents, or other antimicrobial agents. Normally, a therapeutically effective dose of the β-hairpin peptidomimetics described herein will provide therapeutic benefit without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) or the LD100 (the dose lethal to 100% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is the therapeutic index. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a dosage range that is not toxic for use in humans. The dosage of the β-hairpin peptidomimetics of the invention lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the effective dose with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within the range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dose can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition (see, e.g. Fingl et al. 1975, In : The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Ch.1, p.1). The following Examples illustrate the invention in more detail but are not intended to limit its scope in any way. The following abbreviations are used in these Examples: HBTU:1-benzotriazol-1-yl-tetramethylurounium hexafluorophosphate (Knorr et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 30, 1927-1930);HOBt:1-hydroxybenzotriazole;DIEA:diisopropylethylamine;HOAT:7-aza-1-hydroxybenzotriazole;HATU:O-(7-aza-benzotriazole-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronoium hexafluorophosphate (Carpino et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994, 35, 2279-2281). Examples 1. Peptide synthesis Coupling of the first protected amino acid residue to the resin 0.5 g of 2-chlorotritylchloride resin (Barlos et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 30, 3943-3946) (0.83 mMol/g, 0.415 mmol) was filled into a dried flask. The resin was suspended in CH2Cl2 (2.5 ml) and allowed to swell at room temperature under constant stirring for 30 min. The resin was treated with 0.415 mMol (1eq) of the first suitably protected amino acid residue (see below) and 284 µl (4eq) of diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) in CH2Cl2 (2.5 ml), the mixture was shaken at 25°C for 4 hours. The resin colour changed to purple and the solution remained yellowish. The resin was shaken (CH2Cl2 /MeOH/DIEA : 17/2/1), 30 ml for 30 min; then washed in the following order with CH2Cl2 (1 x), DMF (1x), CH2Cl2 (1 x), MeOH (1x), CH2Cl2(1x),MeOH (1x), CH2Cl2 (2x), Et2O (2x) and dried under vacuum for 6 hours. Loading was typically 0.6-0.7 mMol/g. The following preloaded resins were prepared: Fmoc-ProO-chlorotritylresin, Fmoc-DProO-chlorotritylresin, and Fmoc-S-(4-S-Alloc-amino)-ProO-chlorotritylresin. Synthesis of the fully protected peptide fragment The synthesis was carried out using a Syro-peptide synthesizer (Multisyntech) using 24 to 96 reaction vessels. In each vessel were placed 60 mg (weight of the resin before loading) of the above resin.

Pegylation of side chain amino junctions with 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy] acetic acid and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid The resin (0.040 mmol) containing the peptide was swollen in 5ml of freshly distilled CH2Cl2 for 30 min and then the palladium catalyst Pd(PPh3)4, 14 mg, 0.3 eq, was added followed by PhSiH3, 0.8 mmol, 20 eq. The resin was shaken for 2 h and the reaction solution was filtered off. The reaction was repeated again by employing the same amount of reagents and after 2 h the resin was washed with CH2Cl2 and DMF and finally with Et2O. The resin was swollen again in freshly distilled CH2Cl2 (2ml) for 30 min, the solvent was filtered off and the resin swollen in DMF for 1 h. A solution of DIPEA (10 eq) in 1 ml of DMF was added followed by the addition of 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy] acetic acid or 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid (5 eq) and finally by a solution of HATU (5 eq) in 1ml of DMF. The resin was shaken for 3 h and the reaction solution was filtered off. The reaction was repeated again by employing the same amount of reagents and after 3 h the resin was washed with CH2Cl2 and DMF and finally with Et2O. The pegylation procedure was performed optionally, after the synthesis of the fully protected peptide fragment had been terminated, and then subsequently either Procedure A, Procedure B or Procedure C, as described hereinbelow, was adopted, depending on whether no intertrand linkages or disulfide β-strand linkages or lactam β-strand linkages were to be formed. Procedure A: Cyclization and work up of backbone cyclized peptides Cleavage of the fully protected peptide fragment After completion of the synthesis, the resin was suspended in 1 ml (0.39 mMol) of 1% TFA in CH2Cl2 (v/v) for 3 minutes, filtered and the filtrate was neutralized with ml (1.17 mMol, 3eq.) of 20% DIEA in CH2Cl2 (v/v). This procedure was repeated twice to ensure completion of the cleavage. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness and the product was fully deprotected [cleavage mixture containing 95% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 2.5% water and 2.5% triisopropylsilane (TIS)] to be analyzed by reverse phase-HPLC (column C18) and ESI-MS to monitor the efficiency of the linear peptide synthesis. Cyclization of the linear peptide 100 mg of the fully protected linear peptide were dissolved in DMF (9 ml, conc. 10 mg/ml). Then 41.8 mg (0.110 mMol, 3 eq.) of HATU, 14.9 mg (0.110 mMol, 3 eq) of HOAt and 1 ml (0.584 mMol) of 10% DIEA in DMF (v/v) were added, and the mixture was vortexed at 20°C for 16 hours and subsequently concentrated under high vacuum. The residue was partitioned between CH2Cl2 and H2O/CH3CN (90/10: v/v). The CH2Cl2 phase was evaporated to yield the fully protected cyclic peptide. Deprotection and purification of the cyclic peptide The cyclic peptide obtained was dissolved in 1 ml of the cleavage mixture containing 95% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 2.5% water and 2.5% triisopropylsilane (TIS). The mixture was left to stand at 20°C for 2.5 hours and then concentrated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in a solution of H2O/acetic acid (75/25: v/v) and the mixture was extracted with diisopropylether. The water phase was dried under vacuum and then the product was purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC. After lyophilisation the products were obtained as white powders and analysed by ESI-MS. The analytical data comprising purity after preparative HPLC and ESI-MS are shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3. Analytical method 1: Analytical HPLC retention times (RT, in minutes) were determined using a VYDAC 218MS5215 column with the following solvents A (H2O + 0.02% TFA) and B (CH3CN) and the gradient: 0 min: 92%A, 8%B; 8 min: 62%A 38%B; 9-12 min: 0% A, 100%B. Analytical method 2: Analytical HPLC retention times (RT, in minutes) were determined using an EX (s.n. 217808-2 column with the following solvents A (H2O + 0.02% TFA) and B (CH3CN) and the gradient: 0 min: 95%A, 5%B; 8 min: 30%A 70%B; 9 min: 0%A, 100%B; 9-12 min: 95% A, 5%B. Procedure B: Cyclization and work up of backbone cyclized peptides having disulfide β-strand linkages Formation of disulfide β-strand linkage After completion of the synthesis, the resin was swelled in 3 ml of dry DMF for 1 h. Then 10 eq. of iodine solution in DMF (6 ml) were added to the reactor, followed by stirring for 1.5 h. The resin was filtered and a fresh solution of iodine (10 eq.) in DMF (6 ml) was added, followed by stirring for another 3 h. The resin was filtered and washed with DMF (3x) and CH2Cl2(3x). Backbone cyclization, cleavage and purification of the peptide After formation of the disulfide β-strand linkage, the resin was suspended in 1 ml (0.39 mMol) of 1% TFA in CH2Cl2 (v/v) for 3 minutes and filtered, and the filtrate was neutralized with 1ml (1.17 mMol, 3eq.) of 20% DIEA in CH2Cl2 (v/v). This procedure was repeated twice to ensure completion of the cleavage. The volatiles were removed and 6 ml dry DMF were added to the tube. Then 2 eq. of HATU in dry DMF (1ml) and 4 eq. of DIPEA in dry DMF (1 ml) were added to the peptide, followed by stirring for 16 h. The volatiles were evaporated to dryness. The crude cyclised peptide was dissolved in 7 ml of CH2Cl2 and extracted with 10% acetonitrile in H2O (4.5 ml) three times. The CH2Cl2 layer was evaporated to dryness. To deprotect the peptide fully, 3 ml of cleavage cocktail TFA:TIS:H2O (95:2.5:2.5) were added, and the mixture was kept for 2.5 h. The volatiles were evaporated to dryness and the crude peptide was dissolved in 20% AcOH in water (7 ml) and extracted with isopropyl ether (4 ml) for three times. The aqueous layer was collected and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC. After lyophilisation the products were obtained as white powders and analysed by ESI-MS analytical method 1 or 2. The analytical data comprising purity after preparative HPLC and ESI-MS are shown in Tables and 1, 2 and 3. Procedure C: Cyclization and work up of backbone cyclized peptides having lactam β-strand linkages Formation of lactam β-strand linkage 0.036 mmol of the resin was taken in a reactor and swelled in dry DMF for 1 hr. To this 41.60mg (1 eq.) of Pd(PPh3)4 and 0.133 ml (30 eq.) of PhSiH3 were added and stirred overnight. The resin was filtered and washed thoroughly with DCM and DMF. The resin was swelled again in dry DMF for 1 hr. To this 1ml DIPEA solution in DMF (24.64 µL of DIPEA in 1 ml DMF, 4 eq.) was added followed by 1ml HATU solution in DMF (27.37 mg of HATU, 2 eq.) and the final volume of the reaction mixture was 7 ml and stirred overnight. The resin was washed thoroughly with DMF, CH2Cl2, DMF, CH2Cl2. Backbone cyclization, cleavage and purification of the peptide The peptide was cleaved from the resin by 1% TFA in DCM and evaporated to dryness and 8 ml of dry DMF added to the tube. 2 equivalents of HATU in dry DMF (1ml) and 4 equivalents of DIPEA in dry DMF (1 ml) were added to the peptide and stirred for 16 h. The volatiles were evaporated to dryness. The crude cyclised peptide was dissolved in 7 ml of DCM and extracted with 10% acetonitrile in H2O (4.5 ml) three times. The DCM layer was evaporated to dryness. The crude cyclised peptide was dissolved in 7 ml of CH2Cl2 and extracted with 10% acetonitrile in H2O (4.5 ml) three times. The CH2Cl2 layer was evaporated to dryness. To deprotect the peptide fully, 3 ml of cleavage cocktail TFA:TIS:H2O (95:2.5:2.5) were added, and the mixture was kept for 2.5 h. The volatiles were evaporated to dryness and the crude peptide was dissolved in 20% AcOH in water (7 ml) and extracted with isopropyl ether (4 ml) for three times. The aqueous layer was collected and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC. After lyophilisation the products were obtained as white powders and analysed by ESI-MS analytical method 1 or 2. The analytical data comprising purity after preparative HPLC and ESI-MS are shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3. Examples 154-155 (n=18) are shown in Table 3. The peptides were synthesized starting with the amino acid DPro which was grafted to the resin. Starting resin was Fmoc-DProO-chlorotrityl resin, which was prepared as described above.

Thereafter the disulfide bridges were formed using the following procedure: For the formation of the disulfide bridge at position P4 and P17 the protected cyclic peptide (36µmol) was swelled in dry DMF for 1 h. The DMF was drained off and was replaced by 2ml NMP and 444µl tri-n-butylphosphine (50eq.) under argon. The resin was shaken for 2h. The solvents were removed and the resin was washed once with 5ml NMP. Thereafter the resin was shaken again with 2ml NMP and 444µl tri-n-butylphosphine (50eq.) under argon for 2h. The resin was washed with DMF and transferred with 90ml DMF into a 250ml flask. 1mmol (330mg) [K3Fe(CN)6] in 10ml water was added and the suspension was agitated gently overnight at 25°C in the dark. The resin was transferred into a reactor and was washed with once with 7ml water and twice with 5ml DMF.

Biological methods 2.1. Preparation of the peptides. Lyophilized peptides were weighed on a Microbalance (Mettler MT5) and dissolved in sterile water to a final concentration of 1 mM unless stated otherwise. Stock solutions were kept at +4°C, light protected. 2.2. Ca2+-assay: CXCR4-antagonizing activity of the peptides. Method 1: 3-4 Mio CXCR4 transfected pre-B cells [see references 1, 2 and 3, below] per measurement were resuspended in 200 µl MSB (20 mM 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-piperazin-1-ethansulfonic acid (HEPES), 136 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl and 1 mM CaCl2) containing 5 mM D-Glucose and were loaded with 0.75 µl of 1 mM Fura-2-acetoxymethylester (Fura-2-AM) for 17 minutes at 37°C. The cells were washed free from Fura-2-AM with a platelet centrifuge and resuspended in 800 µl MSB containing 5 mM D-Glucose. The peptides to be administered were diluted to a 100 fold end concentration in MSB/0.2 % PPL, and 8 µl were injected. [Ca2+]i-dependent fluorescence change in response to single or sequential stimulation with the peptide was recorded with a fluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 340 nM and an end emission wavelength of 510 nM [see ref. 4, below]. Measurements were done under continuous stirring at 37°C. The signal intension was calibrated with 3 mM CaCl2/l mM Ionomycin (maximal fura-2-acetoxymethylester saturation) and 10 µM MnCl2 (minimal Fura-2-acetoxymethylester saturation) and [Ca2+]i-changes are presented in % fura-2-acetoxymethylester saturation. The rate of [Ca2+]i-changes was calculated on the basis of the initial [Ca2+]i-changes and plotted in dependence of chemokine concentration to obtain a sigmoidal curve and to determine the IC50 values. MSB: 20 mM HEPES, 136 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2•2H2O, pH 7.4; Osmolarity: 310 mOsm adjusted with NaOH or HCl, adjusted with H2O or PBS. MSB plus: 5 mM D-glucose in MSB (50 mg/50mL). Fura 2-acetoxymethylester: 1 mM stock solution in dimethylsulfoxide. Method 2: Increases in intracellular calcium were monitored using a Flexstation 384 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) to assay the peptides for CXCR4 antagonism in a mouse pre-B cell line 300-19 stably transfected with human CXCR4 [see references 1, 2 and 3, below]. The cells were batch loaded with the Calcium 3 Assay kit (Molecular Devices) in assay buffer (Hanks Balanced salt solution, HBSS, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature and then 200,000 labeled cells were dispensed into black 96 well assays plates (Costar No. 3603). A 20-fold concentrated solution of peptide in assay buffer was added to the cells and the whole plate was centrifuged to settle the cells to the bottom of the wells. Calcium mobilization induced by 10 nM stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) was measured in the Flexstation 384 (excitation, 485 nM; emission, 525 nM) for 90 seconds. A maximal change in fluorescence response above baseline was used to calculate antagonist activity. The data for dose response curves (antagonist concentration versus % maximum response) were fitted to a four parameter logistic equation using SoftmaxPro 4.6 (Molecular Devices), from which IC50% values were calculated. 2.3. FIGS-Assay™ The assay was performed according to ref. 5, below. Stock dilutions of the peptides (10 mM) were prepared by dissolving in 10 mM Tris-HCl at room temperature. Stock solutions were kept at +4°C, light protected. Working dilutions were prepared extemporaneously by serial dilution in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and added in a final volume of 10 µl directly to the cell cultures. After 48 hours of co-cultivation the cultures were rinsed with PBS and then exposed to glutaraldehyde/ formaldehyde (0.2 % / 2 %) in PBS for five minutes. For photometric quantification the fixed cultures were subsequently incubated with ortho-nitro-phenyl-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as a β-galactosidase substrate, which was enzymatically converted into the chromophore ortho-nitrophenol (ONP). The read out is directly obtained by measuring optical density of wells at 405 nm in an iEMS 96well-plate reader. 2.4. Cytotoxicity assay The cytotoxicity of the peptides to HELA cells (Acc57) and COS-7 cells (CRL-1651) was determined using the MTT reduction assay [see ref. 6 and 7, below]. Briefly the method was as follows: HELA cells and COS-7 cells were seeded at 7.0·103 and, respectively, 4.5·103 cells per well and grown in 96-well microtiter plates for 24 hours at 37°C at 5% CO2. At this point, time zero (Tz) was determined by MTT reduction (see below).The supernatant of the remaining wells was discarded, and fresh medium and the peptides in serial dilutions of 12.5, 25 and 50 µM were pipetted into the wells. Each peptide concentration was assayed in triplicate. Incubation of the cells was continued for 48 hours at 37°C at 5% CO2. Wells were then washed once with PBS and subsequently 100 µl MTT reagent (0.5 mg/mL in medium RPMI1640 and, respectively, DMEM) was added to the wells. This was incubated at 37°C for 2 hours and subsequently the medium was aspirated and 100 µl isopropanol was added to each well. The absorbance at 595 nm of the solubilized product was measured (OD595peptide). For each concentration averages were calculated from triplicates. The percentage of growth was calculated as follows: (OD595peptide-OD595Tz-OD595Empty well) / (OD595Tz-OD595Empty well) x 100% and was plotted for each peptide concentration. The LC 50 values (Lethal Concentration, defined as the concentration that kills 50% of the cells) were determined for each peptide by using the trend line function of EXCEL (Microsoft Office 2000) for the concentrations (50, 25, 12.5 and 0 µM), the corresponding growth percentages and the value -50, (=TREND(C50:C0,%50:%0,-50)). The GI 50 (Growth Inhibition) concentrations were calculated for each peptide by using a trend line function for the concentrations (50, 25, 12.5 and 0 µg/ml), the corresponding percentages and the value 50, (=TREND (C50:C0,%50:%0,50). 2.5. Cell culture 'CCR5' cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 4500 mg/ml glucose, 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), supplemented with 50 U/ml Penicillin and 50 µg/ml Streptomycin (Pen/Strept.). Hut/4-3 cells were maintained in RPMI medium, 10% FBS, supplemented with Pen/Strept. and 10 mM HEPES. HELA cells and CCRF-CEM cells were maintained in RPMI1640 plus 5% FBS, Pen/Strept and 2 mM L-Glutamine. Cos-7 cells were grown in DMEM medium with 4500 mg/ml glucose supplemented with 10% FCS, Pen/Strept. and 2 mM L-Glutamine. All cell lines were grown at 37°C at 5% CO2. Cell media, media supplements, PBS-buffer, HEPES, Pen/Strept., L-Glutamine and sera were purchased from Gibco (Pailsey, UK). All fine chemicals came from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). 2.6. Hemolysis The peptides were tested for their hemolytic activity against human red blood cells (hRBC). Fresh hRBC were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 x g. Peptides at a concentration of 100 µM were incubated with 20% v/v hRBC for 1 hour at 37°C. The final erythrocyte concentration was approximately 0.9x109 cells per ml. A value of 0% resp. 100% cell lysis was determined by incubation of the hRBC in the presence of PBS alone and respectively 0.1% Triton X-100 in H2O. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was 20-fold diluted in PBS buffer and the optical density (OD) of the sample at 540 nM was measured. The 100% lyses value (OD540H20) gave an OD540 of approximately 1.3-1.8. Percent hemolysis was calculated as follows: (OD540peptide/OD540H20) x100%. 2.7. Chemotactic Assay (Cell migration assay) The chemotactic response of CCRF-CEM cells to a gradient of stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1) was measured using disposable assay plates from Neuroprobe (5 µ pore size) (Gaithersburg, MD), according to the manufacturer's directions and references therein [especially ref. 8, below]. Briefly, one 175 cm2 flask was washed once with Dubecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), and trypsinized for 10 minutes or until cells had lifted. The trypsin was neutralized by the addition of fresh medium containing serum and the cells were pelleted, washed once in DPBS, and resuspended at 1-0.5 X 107 cells/ml in RPMI + 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). 45µl of cell suspension were mixed with 5 µl of 10-fold concentrated PEM peptide diluted in the same assay medium. 35 µl of this mixture were applied to the top of the assay filter. The cells were allowed to migrate (at 37°) into the bottom chamber of the assay plate containing 1 nM SDF-1. After 4 hours, the filter was removed and MTT was added to the migrated cells to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and incubated for a further 4 hours. After labeling with MTT, all medium was removed and 100 µl of isopropanol + 10 mM HCl were added to the cells. The optical absorbance at 595 nm (ABS595) was read using a Tecan Genios plate reader with Magellan software. The number of cells migrated was determined by comparing ABS595 values against a standard curve generated with a known number of cells in the assay plate and were plotted against SDF-1 concentration to obtain a sigmoidal curve and to determine the IC50 values. The values for IC50 were determined using the Trendline function in Microsoft Excel by fitting a logarithmic curve to the averaged datapoints. 2.8 Plasmastability 405 µl of plasma/albumin solution were placed in a polypropylene (PP) tube and spiked with 45 µl of compound from a 100 µM solution B, derived from 135 µl of PBS and 15 µl of 1 mM peptide in PBS, pH 7.4. 150 µl aliquots were transferred into individual wells of the 10 kDa filter plate (Millipore MAPPB 1010 Biomax membrane). For "0 minutes controls": 270 µl of PBS were placed in a PP tube and 30 µl of stock solution B was added and vortexed. 150 µl of control solution was placed into one well of the filter plate and serves as "filtered control". Further 150 µl of control solution were placed directly into a receiver well (reserved for filtrate) and serve as "not-filtered control". The entire plate including evaporation lid was incubated for 60 min at 37°C. Plasma samples (rat plasma: Harlan Sera lab UK, human plasma: Blutspendezentrum Zürich) were centrifuged at least for 2 h at 4300 rpm (3500 g) and 15°C in order to yield 100 µl filtrate. For "serum albumin"-samples (freshly prepared human albumin: Sigma A-4327, rat albumin: Sigma A-6272, all at 40 mg/ml concentration in PBS) approximately 1 hour of centrifugation is sufficient. The filtrates in the receiver PP plate were analysed by LC/MS as followes: Column: Jupiter C18 (Phenomenex), mobile phases: (A) 0.1% formic acid in water and (B) acetonitrile, gradient: 5%-100% (B) in 2 minutes, electrospray ionization, MRM detection (triple quadrupole). The peak areas were determined and triplicate values are averaged. The binding is expressed in percent of the (filtered and not-filtered time point 0 min) control 1 and 2 by: 100-(100 * T60/T0). The average from these values is then calculated (see ref. 9 below). 3.0. Results The results of the experiments described under 2.2 - 2.7, above, are indicated in Table 4 herein below.
