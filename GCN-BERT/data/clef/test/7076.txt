Step 2:
Compound 9-ii (100 mg, 0.21 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL of dichloromethane, and added with a drop of DMF, then added with oxalyl chloride (18ÂµL, 0.21 mmoL). The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour before TLC (PE: EA = 5: 1) showed completion of the reaction. The solvent was removed by evaporation, then the crude product was dissolved in 2 mL of acetonitrile, and added with compound 9-iii (38 mg, 0.25 mmol) and DMAP (1 mg, 0.05%). The mixture was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere for 2 hours. After TLC (PE: EA= 5: 1) showed completion of the reaction, compound 9-iv (110 mg, 90%) was obtained by column chromatography directly.
