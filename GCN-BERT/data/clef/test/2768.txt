HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USES CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] The benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/785,763, filed March 14, 2014 is claimed, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD [0002] Provided is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising omecamtiv mecarbil, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrate, or a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrate of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, such as omecamtiv mecarbil dihydochloride hydrate. BACKGROUND [0003] The cardiac sarcomere is the basic unit of muscle contraction in the heart. The cardiac sarcomere is a highly ordered cytoskeletal structure composed of cardiac muscle myosin, actin and a set of regulatory proteins. The discovery and development of small molecule cardiac muscle myosin activators would lead to promising treatments for acute and chronic heart failure. Cardiac muscle myosin is the cytoskeletal motor protein in the cardiac muscle cell. It is directly responsible for converting chemical energy into the mechanical force, resulting in cardiac muscle contraction. [0004] Current positive inotropic agents, such as beta-adrenergic receptor agonists or inhibitors of phosphodiesterase activity, increase the concentration of intracellular calcium, thereby increasing cardiac sarcomere contractility. However, the increase in calcium levels increase the velocity of cardiac muscle contraction and shortens systolic ejection time, which has been linked to potentially life-threatening side effects. In contrast, cardiac muscle myosin activators work by a mechanism that directly stimulates the activity of the cardiac muscle myosin motor protein, without increasing the intracellular calcium concentration. They accelerate the rate-limiting step of the myosin enzymatic cycle and shift it in favor of the force-producing state. Rather than increasing the velocity of cardiac contraction, this mechanism instead lengthens the systolic ejection time, which results in increased cardiac muscle contractility and cardiac output in a potentially more oxygen-efficient manner. [0005] U.S. Patent No. 7,507,735, herein incorporated by reference, discloses a genus of compounds, including omecamtiv mecarbil (AMG 423, CK-1827452), having the structure: Me F Η Η [0006] Omecamtiv mecarbil is a first in class direct activator of cardiac myosin, the motor protein that causes cardiac contraction. It is being evaluated as a potential treatment of heart failure in both intravenous and oral formulations with the goal of establishing a new continuum of care for patients in both the in-hospital and outpatient settings. [0007] Clinical trials providing an I.V. delivery of omecamtiv mecarbil have shown that plasma levels of the drug can be delivered safely and effectively. However, standard release formulations and some extended release formulations gave peak to trough ratios that may be too great to provide a safe and effective amount of omecamtiv mecarbil to patients who need the drug in a chronic or preventative setting (See, Figure 4). Accordingly, an effective sustained release formulation would be desirable for increased patient safety and effectiveness. SUMMARY [0008] Provided is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising: omecamtiv mecarbil, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrate, or a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrate of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; a control release agent; a pH modifying agent; a filler; and a lubricant. [0009] Also provided is a process for making a pharmaceutical formulation comprising: blending a mixture comprising omecamtiv mecarbil, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrate, or a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrate of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a control release agent, a pH modifying agent, and a filler; lubricating the blended mixture using a lubricant; granulating the lubricated blend; lubricating the resultant granulation using the lubricant; and compressing the lubricated granulation into desired form. [0010] Also provided is a method of treating a disease selected from acute heart failure and chronic heart failure, comprising administering a pharmaceutical formulation described herein to a patient in need thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0021] Unless otherwise specified, the following definitions apply to terms found in the specification and claims: [0022] “Treatment” or “treating” means any treatment of a disease in a patient, including: a) preventing the disease, that is, causing the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop; b) inhibiting the disease; c) slowing or arresting the development of clinical symptoms; and/or d) relieving the disease, that is, causing the regression of clinical symptoms. Treatment of diseases and disorders herein is intended to also include the prophylactic administration of a pharmaceutical formulation described herein to a subject (i.e., an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human) believed to be in need of preventative treatment, such as, for example, chronic heart failure. [0023] The term “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount effective, when administered to a human or non-human patient, to treat a disease, e.g., a therapeutically effective amount may be an amount sufficient to treat a disease or disorder responsive to myosin activation. The therapeutically effective amount may be ascertained experimentally, for example by assaying blood concentration of the chemical entity, or theoretically, by calculating bioavailability. [0024] “Pharmaceutically acceptable salts” include, but are not limited to salts with inorganic acids, such as hydrochlorate (i.e., hydrochloride), phosphate, diphosphate, hydrobromate, sulfate, sulfinate, nitrate, and like salts; as well as salts with an organic acid, such as malate, maleate, fumarate, tartrate, succinate, citrate, acetate, lactate, methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethylsulfonate, benzoate, salicylate, stearate, and alkanoate such as acetate, HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH where η is 0-4, and like salts. Similarly, pharmaceutically acceptable cations include, but are not limited to sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium, and ammonium. Those skilled in the art will recognize various synthetic methodologies that may be used to prepare non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts. [0025] The term “hydrate” refers to the chemical entity formed by the interaction of water and a compound, including, for example, hemi-hydrates, monohydrates, dihydrates, trihydrates, etc. [0026] “Crystalline form,” “polymorph,” and “novel form” may be used interchangeably herein, and are meant to include all crystalline and amorphous forms of the compound, including, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, solvates, hydrates, unsolvated polymorphs (including anhydrates), conformational polymorphs, and amorphous forms, as well as mixtures thereof, unless a particular crystalline or amorphous form is referred to. [0027] The specification and claims contain listing of species using the language “selected from . . . and . . .” and “is . . . or . . .” (sometimes referred to as Markush groups). When this language is used in this application, unless otherwise stated it is meant to include the group as a whole, or any single members thereof, or any subgroups thereof. The use of this language is merely for shorthand purposes and is not meant in any way to limit the removal of individual elements or subgroups as needed. [0028] Provided is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising omecamtiv mecarbil, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrate, or a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrate of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, such as omecamtiv mecarbil dihydochloride hydrate. [0029] The pharmaceutical formulations described herein are capable of releasing omecamtiv mecarbil evenly at a pace controlled by the diffusion of omecamtiv mecarbil through a gel layer formed by the hydration of the control release agents in the tablets. In some embodiments, in conjunction with other above or below embodiments, the present modified release matrix tablets demonstrate a minimal pH-dependent release in-vitro. In some embodiments, in conjunction with other above or below embodiments, complete release of omecamtiv mecarbil is achieved in both pH 2 and 6.8 dissolution medium within 24 hours, possibly resulting in less inter- and intra-subject variability and food effect.

[0058] In some embodiments, in conjunction with other above or below embodiments, fumaric acid was used as the pH modifying agent as it is less hygroscopic and more compatible with omecamtiv mecarbil dihydrochloride hydrate than citric acid, resulting in less or no active form transformation and no changes in tablet appearance when stored at 40 °C/75%RH for 6 months, leading to improved final product quality. Additionally, fumaric acid is more acidic (2-fold) than citric acid. Therefore, it is more efficient, i.e., 1:1 weight ratio to active instead of 2:1, to use fumaric acid to modulate the microenvironmental pH to enhance omecamtiv mecarbil release at neutral environment. Fumaric acid also has a very slow dissolution rate. As a result, fumaric acid will stay in the tablet longer and maintain the low micro-environmental pH better, resulting in more complete release of omecamtiv mecarbil within 24 hours.

Water (4.0 L, 2.0 volumes) was added at 20 °C over 30 minutes followed by Piperazine Nitro Freebase seed (18 g, 0.06 mol, 0.01 equiv). The mixture was aged for 5 minutes and the remaining water (24.0 F, 12.0 volumes) was added over 90 minutes. After holding overnight at 20 °C, the supernatant concentration of Piperazine Nitro Freebase was measured (< 10 mg/mF). The mixture was filtered through an aurora filter equipped with a 12 pm Teflon® cloth. The filter cake was washed with a mixture of water (3.3 F, 1.65 volumes) and isopropanol (700 mF, 0.35 volumes) and dried to constant weight (defined as < 1.0% weight loss for 2 consecutive TGA measurements over a period of 2 hours) on filter with vacuum and a nitrogen sweep (48 h). The combined losses of Piperazine Nitro Freebase in the mother liquors and the wash were aproximately 7.5 %. Piperazine Nitro Freebase was isolated 1.67 kg in 92.5% corrected yield with 100.0 wt% and 99.4% LCAP purity. Synthesis of the API SM Phenyl Carbamate-HCl CIC02Ph ^ h2n^^n ACN, νμρ Amino Pyridine [0093] A 60 L, glass-lined, jacketed reactor set at 20 °C under nitrogen atmosphere and vented through a scrubber (containing 5Ν NaOH) was charged with 2.5 kg of Amino Pyridine (1.0 equiv, 23.1 moles), followed by 25 L (19.6 kg, 10 vol) acetonitrile. After initiating agitation and (the endothermic) dissolution of the Amino Pyridine, the vessel was charged with 12.5 L of /V-methyl-2-pyrolidinone (12.8 kg, 5 vol). An addition funnel was charged with 1.8 L (0.6 equiv, 13.9 moles) phenyl chloroformate which was then added over 68 minutes to the solution of the Amino Pyridine keeping the internal temperature < 30°C. The reaction was agitated for > 30 minutes at an internal temperature of 20 ± 5 °C. The vessel was then charged with 61 ± 1 g of seed as a slurry in 200 mL acetonitrile and aged for > 30 min. The addition funnel was charged with 1.25 L (0.45 equiv, 9.7 moles) of phenyl chloroformate which was then added over 53 minutes to the reaction suspension while again keeping the temperature < 30°C. The contents of the reactor were aged > 30 hours at 20 ± 5°C. After assaying the supernatant (< 15mg/g for both product and starting material), the solids were filtered using an Aurora filter equipped with a 12μΐη Teflon cloth. The mother liquor was forwarded to a 2nd 60 L, glass-lined, jacketed reactor. The reactor and cake were rinsed with lxl0Lof5:10 NMP/ACN and 1 χ 10 L ACN. The washes were forwarded to the 2nd reactor as well. The cake was dried under vacuum with a nitrogen bleed for > 24 hours to afford 5.65 kg (90.2% yield) of the product, Phenyl Carbamate-HCl as an off-white solid in 98.8 wt% with 99.2% LCAP purity.

The resulting slurry was agitated under a nitrogen sweep. To the mixture was added dropwise over 45 ± 30 min: 7.7 % w/w aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (629 g, 1.25 equiv of sodium bicarbonate dissolved in 7.50 L water), maintaining an internal temperature of 20 ± 5 °C by jacket control (NOTE: addition is endothermic, and may evolve up to 1 equiv of carbon dioxide gas). The mixture was stirred for >15 min, resulting in a clear biphasic mixture. Agitation was stopped and the layers were allowed to settle. [0097] The bottom (aqueous) layer was drained and analyzed by pH paper to ensure that the layer is pH > 6. Quantititative HPLC analysis of the upper (organic) layer revealed 97-100% assay yield of the methyl 4-(2-fluoro-3-nitrobenzyl)piperazine-l-carboxylate freebase (1.73 - 1.78 kg). The upper (organic) layer was transferred through an in-line filter into a 20-L Hastelloy® hydrogenator, and the 100-L reactor and lines were rinsed with an additional aliquot of isopropyl acetate (2.00 L, 1.00 Vol). The hydrogenator was purged with nitrogen and vented to atmospheric pressure. To the reaction mixture was added a slurry of 5.0 wt% palladium on carbon (20.0 g, Strem/BASF Escat™ 1421, approx 50% water) in isopropyl acetate (400 mL), followed by a 400 mL rinse. The resulting reaction mixture was diluted with an additional aliquot of isopropyl acetate (1.2 L; total isopropyl acetate amount is 10.0 L, 5.00 Vol). The hydrogenator was purged three times with nitrogen (pressurized to 60 ± 10 psig, then vented to atmospheric pressure), then pressurized to 60 ± 5 psig with hydrogen. The reaction mixture was stirred at < 100 rpm at 30 ± 5 °C while maintaining 60 ± 5 psig hydrogen, for >2 hours until reaction was deemed complete. This temperature and pressure correspond to a measured kLa value of approx 0.40 in a 20-L Hydrogenator. End of reaction is determined by dramatic decrease in hydrogen consumption accompanied by a relief in the heat evolution of the reaction. To control potential dimeric impurities, the reaction is continued for at least 30 minutes after this change in reaction profile, and HPLC analysis is performed to confirm that >99.5% conversion of the hydroxyl-amine to the aniline is achieved. [0098] At the end of reaction, the hydrogenator was purged with nitrogen twice (pressurized to 60 ± 10 psig, then vented to atmospheric pressure). The crude reaction mixture was filtered through a 5 pm filter followed by a 0.45 pm filter in series, into a 40-L glass-lined reactor. The hydrogenator and lines were washed with an additional aliquot of isopropyl acetate (2.00 L). Quantitative HPLC analysis of the crude reaction mixture revealed 95-100% assay yield (1.52 - 1.60 kg aniline product). The reaction mixture was distilled under reduced pressure (typically 250 - 300 mbar) at a batch temperature of 50 ± 5 °C until the total reaction volume was approximately 8.00 L (4.00 Vol). The batch was subjected to a constant-volume distillation at 50 ± 5 °C, 250 - 300 mbar, by adding heptane to control the total batch volume. After approximately 8.00 L (4.00 Vol) of heptane were added, GC analysis indicated that the solvent composition was approximately 50 % isopropyl acetate, 50% heptane. Vacuum was broken, and the internal batch temperature was maintained at 50 ± 5 °C. To the reaction mixture was added a slurry of seed (20.0 grams of product methyl 4-(3-amino-2-fluorobenzyl)piperazine-l-carboxylate, in a solvent mixture of 80 mL heptane and 20 mL isopropyl acetate). The resulting slurry was allowed to stir at 50 ± 5 °C for 2 ± 1 hours, then cooled to 20 ± 5 °C over 2.5 ± 1.0 h. Additional heptane (24.0 L, 12.0 Vol) was added dropwise over 2 hours, and the batch was allowed to stir at 20 ± 5 °C for > 1 hours (typically overnight). Quantitative HPLC analysis of this filtered supernatant revealed < 5 mg/mL product in solution, and the product crystals were 50 - 400 pm birefringent rods. The reaction slurry was filtered at 20 °C onto a filter cloth, and the cake was displacement-washed with heptane (6.00 L, 2.00 Vol). The cake was dried on the filter under nitrogen sweep at ambient temperature for > 4 hours, until sample dryness was confirmed by LOD analysis (indicated <1.0 wt% loss). The product methyl 4-(3-amino-2-fluorobenzyl)piperazine-l-carboxylate (1.56 kg) was isolated as a pale-yellow powder in 86% yield at 99.8 wt% by HPLC with 100.0 LCAP2io- [Analysis of the combined filtrates and washes revealed 108 grams (7.0%) of product lost to the mother liquors.

Omecamtiv Mecarbil Dihvdrochloride Hydrate procedure [0099] To a 15L glass lined reactor were charged methyl 4-(3-amino-2-fluorobenzyl)piperazine-l-carboxylate (1,202 g, 4.50 mol), phenyl (6-methylpyridin-3-yl)carbamate hydrochloride (1,444 g, 5.40 mol), and tetrahydrofuran (4.81 L). The resulting slurry was agitated under a nitrogen sweep and /V,/V-diisopropylethylamine (1,019 L, 5.85 mol) was then charged to the slurry which resulted in a brown solution. The temperature of the solution was increased to 65 °C and agitated for 22 h, until <1% AUC piperazine aniline remained by HPLC analysis. [0100] The batch was cooled to 50 °C and distilled under reduced pressure while maintaining the internal temperature of the vessel below 50 °C by adjusting vacuum pressure. 2-Propanol was added with residual vacuum at a rate to maintain a constant volume in the 15 L reactor. A total of 10.5 kg of 2-propanol was required to achieve <5% THF by GC. Water (2.77 kg) was then charged to the reactor followed by the addition of 6Ν HC1 (1.98 kg) at a rate to maintain the internal temperature below 60 °C. The reactor was brought to ambient pressure under a nitrogen sweep. The solution was then heated to 60 °C, and transferred to a 60L glass lined reactor through an inline filter. The 15L reactor was then rinsed with 1:1 water/2-propanol (1.2L) which was sent through the inline filter to the 60L reactor. [0101] The 60L reactor was adjusted to 45 °C and a slurry of seed (114 g, 0.23 mol) in 2-propanol (0.35 L) was added to the reactor resulting in a slurry. The batch was aged at 45 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of 2-propanol (3.97 kg) through an inline filter over 2 h. The batch was heated to 55°C over 1 h and held for 0.25 h, then cooled back to 45°C over 1 h and held overnight at 45 °C. 2-propanol (11.71 kg) was then added through an inline filter to the batch over 3 h. The batch was aged for 1 h and then cooled to 20°C over 2 h and held at 20 °C for 0.5 h. The batch was then recirculated though a wet mill affixed with 1-medium and 2-fine rotor-stators operating at 56 Hz for 2.15 h, until no further particle size reduction was observed by microscopy. [0102] The batch was then filtered through a 20” Hastelloy® filter fitted with a 12 um filter cloth under 500 torr vacuum. A wash solution of 95:5 2-propanol:water (1.82 L) was charged through an inline filter to the 60L reactor, then onto the filter. A second wash of 2-propanol (2.85L) was charged through an inline filter to the 60L reactor, then onto the filter. The batch was then dried under 5 psi humidified nitrogen pressure until <5,000 ppm 2-propanol, and 2.5-5% water remained. The final solid was discharged from the filter to afford 2.09 kg of methyl 4-(2-fluoro-3-(3-(6-methylpyridin-3-yl)ureido)benzyl)piperazine-lcarboxylate as an off-white crystalline solid in 89% yield at 99.88 wt% by HPLC, 100.0% AUC.

Table 1 shows the prototype formulation compositions. The prototype MR matrix tablets are manufactured via a conventional high shear wet granulation process. This includes screening omecamtiv mecarbil anhydrate, lactose monohydrate FFL 316, microcrystalline cellulose, Avicel® PH 101, Methocel™ Κ100 Μ CR, and citric acid monohydrate through a #20 mesh US standard screen followed by charging the screened materials into an appropriate size of high shear granulator, where the materials are dry mixed for a specific time at the pre-determined impeller and chopper speeds (granulator size, dry mixing time, impeller and chopper speeds are scale-dependent parameters). The wet granulation process starts with the addition of pre-prepared 3% w/w Methocel™ Ε5 solution using a pre-selected spray nozzle at a pre-determined spray pressure and spray rate. The pre-determined impeller and chopper speeds are used during the wet granulation process (the nozzle size, spray rate, spray pressure, impeller, and chopper speeds are scale-dependent parameters). After wet granulation, the wet mass is dried using a fluid bed drying process with a target of FOD (loss on drying) of <2.4% (fluid bed granulator is scale-dependent The dried granulation is then milled using a Fitzmill® using a pre-determined speed and screen size (Fitzmill® model, speed and screen size are scale-dependent parameters). After milling, the milled dry granulation is lubricated using the pre-screened (#30 mesh) magnesium stearate in a tumble blender at a pre-determined speed, time, and fill-volume (tumble blender model, blending speed, time, and fill-volume are scale-dependent parameters). After the lubrication, the final blend is compressed into MR matrix tablets using a rotary tablet press at a target tablet hardness of 10-14 kp.
