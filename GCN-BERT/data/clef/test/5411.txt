TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), to products produced by the process of the invention as well as to their use. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate using a carbonation process, where the crystal habit of the precipitated calcium carbonate can be controlled and to products produced by the process. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Calcium carbonate is used extensively in the paper industry as a filler component in paper. It is a low cost, high brightness filler used to increase sheet brightness and opacity. Its use has increased dramatically in the last decades due to the conversion from acid to alkaline papermaking at paper mills. Both natural and synthetic calcium carbonates are used in the paper industry. Natural carbonate, or limestone, is ground to a small particle size prior to its use in paper, while synthetic calcium carbonate is manufactured by a precipitation reaction and is therefore called precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). Besides its use in the papermaking industry, precipitated calcium carbonate is also used for various other purposes, e.g. as filler or pigment in the paint industries, and as functional filler for the manufacture of plastic materials, plastisols, sealing compounds, printing inks, rubber, toothpaste, cosmetics, etc. Precipitated calcium carbonate exists in three primary crystalline forms: calcite, aragonite and vaterite, and there are many different polymorphs (crystal habits) for each of these crystalline forms. Calcite has a trigonal structure with typical crystal habits such as scalenohedral (S-PCC), rhombohedral (R-PCC), hexagonal prismatic, pinacoidal, colloidal (C-PCC), cubic, and prismatic (P-PCC). Aragonite is an orthorhombic structure with typical crystal habits of twinned hexagonal prismatic crystals, as well as diverse assortment of thin elongated prismatic, curved bladed, steep pyramidal, chisel shaped crystals, branching tree, and coral or worm-like form. Usually, PCC is prepared by introducing CO2 into an aqueous suspension of calcium hydroxide, the so-called milk of lime [in-line-formulae]Ca(OH)2+CO2→CaCO3+H2O.[/in-line-formulae] This process has demonstrated the capability to produce PCC with superior opacifying characteristics. PCC is typically superior in opacifying and brightening the sheet, and also as filler and/or bulk in the sheet of paper, compared to ground calcium carbonate (so-called GCC). Alternatively, it is also known to prepare precipitated calcium carbonate by introducing an aqueous suspension of calcium hydroxide into carbonated water. Such a process can be named as an “inverse” carbonation process. Kosin et al. describes in U.S. Pat. No. 4,888,160 an “inverse” carbonation process for the production of cuboidal calcium carbonate in a reaction vessel with a recycle piping system. The aqueous suspension of calcium hydroxide is introduced into carbonated water having a pH of 6 at a rate so that the pH of the resultant slurry formed is in a range between 8 and 9. The resultant calcium carbonate has a cuboidal shape and an average particle size of 1 to 3 μm. Another “inverse” carbonation process for the production of cubic calcium carbonate is disclosed by Masaru et al. in JP 4031314. In this process, an aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry at a temperature of 20 to 80° C. is slowly added—at a rate of 0.001 to 0.01 fold/minute per volume of carbonated water—to carbonated water at a temperature of 20 to 60° C. until the reaction reaches a pH of 11 or less. Then the reaction product is filtered and dried. The resultant calcium carbonate has an average particle size of 1 to 10 μm. The disadvantages of the above described “inverse” carbonation processes are the low addition rate needed to obtain the desired product as well as the low solid content of the obtained slurry. Accordingly, there exists a need to develop an “inverse” carbonation process where the crystal habit of the resulting precipitated calcium carbonate can be governed and where a higher solid content of the precipitated calcium carbonate in the resulting slurry can be achieved. In other words, there exists a need to provide a more economical process for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate via an “inverse” carbonation process compared to the processes already known in the art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate which produces a precipitated calcium carbonate that can have other crystal habits than those produced by the known “inverse” carbonation processes. More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an “inverse” carbonation process for the production of prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate (P-PCC). It is an additional object of the present invention to provide an “inverse” carbonation process for the production of scalenohedral precipitated calcium carbonate (S-PCC). It is yet an additional object of the present invention to provide an “inverse” carbonation process for the production of colloidal precipitated calcium carbonate (c-PCC). It is a further object of the present invention to provide the various precipitated calcium carbonate products. These and additional objects are provided by the process according to the present invention for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate by an “inverse” carbonation process. The process according to the present invention requires that the addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry to the reaction vessel is such that an average conductivity of the reaction contents in the reaction vessel during the reaction is in a range of 100 to 6 000 μS/cm. These and additional objects and advantages will be more fully understood in view of the following detailed description. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS In the drawing: FIG. 1 is a SEM photomicrograph of prismatic-shaped PCC that was obtained according to the invention by the carbonation process described in Example 5; and FIG. 2 is a SEM photomicrograph of scalenohedral-shaped PCC having rosette-like aggregate structure that was obtained according to the invention by the carbonation process described in Example 12. FIG. 3 is a SEM photomicrograph of colloidal PCC that was obtained according to the invention by the carbonation process described in Example 15. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION All parts, percentages and ratios used herein are expressed by weight unless otherwise specified. All documents cited herein are incorporated by reference. As employed in the present description and claims, the term “colloidal PCC” (chemical formula: CaCO3) designates a PCC product in the form of aggregates/agglomerates of individual PCC particles in which the aggregates/agglomerates have a surface area of at least 5 m2/g as determined by the BET method (Brunauer, Emmet, Teler, ISO 9277). The aggregates/agglomerates preferably have an equivalent spherical particle size (median particle size, MPS) in the range about 0.1-5.0 μm, e.g. about 0.2-4 μm, typically about 0.5-3.0 μm, as determined e.g. by sedimentation on a Sedigraph 5100 from Micromeritics. The aggregates'/agglomerates' BET surface area will typically be up to about 100 m2/g, more typically up to about 80 m2/g, e.g. up to about 50 m2/g, e.g. up to about 30 m2/g and typically at least about 5 m2/g, e.g. at least about 10 m2/g. The aggregates/agglomerates consist of a greater or smaller number of single crystals having an equivalent spherical particle size of, typically, about 0.01-0.50 μm. A “slurry” in the meaning of the present invention is a suspension (comprising essentially insoluble solids and water and optionally further additives) and usually has a higher density than the liquid without solids from which it is formed. A “specific surface area” (SSA) or “BET specific surface area” in the meaning of the present invention relates to the specific surface area measured via the method provided in the examples section hereafter. The term “brightness” as used in the context of the present invention is a measurement of the percentage of diffuse light reflected from a powder tablet produced from a pigment. A brighter pigment reflects more diffuse light. As used herein, brightness of the pigment may be measured at a wavelength of light of 457 nm (R457) and is specified in percent. Considering the drawbacks of known “inverse” carbonation processes, it is an objective to provide a process for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate which produces a precipitated calcium carbonate that has other crystal habits than those produced by the known “inverse” carbonation processes. The object outlined above has been solved by a process for production of precipitated calcium carbonate, comprising the following steps: a) providing a reaction vessel containing an aqueous phase at an initial temperature; b) injecting a carbon dioxide generating compound into the aqueous phase until the pH of the aqueous phase is in the range of around 5 to around 7; and c) subsequently adding a calcium hydroxide slurry at an initial temperature to the reaction vessel while continuing the injection of the carbon dioxide generating compound, in order to obtain an aqueous slurry of the precipitated calcium carbonate, wherein in step c) the addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry to the reaction vessel is such that an average electrical conductivity of the reaction contents in the reaction vessel during the reaction is in a range of 100 to 6 000 μS/cm. In view of the foregoing, the inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found that the different crystal habits of precipitated calcium carbonate produced by an “inverse” carbonation process can be governed by controlling the addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry. The addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry is linked to the average electrical conductivity of the reaction contents during the reaction, the average conductivity being monitored during the reaction. Without wishing to being bound to this theory, the inventors of the present invention believe that the average electrical conductivity of the reaction contents is mainly governed by the concentration of free Ca2+-ions and (OH)−-ions in the reaction contents, the free Ca2+-ions and (OH)−-ions being derived from the following reaction: [in-line-formulae]Ca(OH)2(s)→Ca2+(aq)+2OH−(aq).[/in-line-formulae] It is pointed out that the person skilled in the art is aware of the fact that the electrical conductivity of the reaction contents is also dependent on the quality of the water, i.e. the hardness of the water which is depending on the concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions dissolved in the water, as well as of other ions originating from the raw material from which the calcium hydroxide slurry is formed. For the purpose of the present invention, the “reaction contents” are defined as the contents included in the reaction vessel during the reaction, including the aqueous phase, the carbon dioxide generating compound, the calcium hydroxide slurry, already formed precipitated calcium carbonate as well as optional additives which can be added during the reaction. Hence, it is clear to the person skilled in the art that the initial electrical conductivity of the aqueous phase will be higher when hard water (high concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) is used, and lower when soft water (low concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) is used. When the addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry to the carbonated water is rather high, i.e. the amount of calcium hydroxide slurry added is higher than the amount of carbon dioxide generating compound, e.g. CO2, added, then free Ca2+-ions remain in excess in solution. In this case the average electrical conductivity increases due to these free ions and is usually found to be in the range of greater than 1 200 to 6 000 μS/cm. When the addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry to the carbonated water is rather low, i.e. a low amount of calcium hydroxide slurry is added, then all or most of the free Ca2+-ions react with the carbon dioxide which leads to a low concentration of free Ca2+-ions in the reaction. In this case the average electrical conductivity of the reaction contents observed is found to be low, in particular below or equal to 1 200 μS/cm. Based on the above, the inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found that by controlling the addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry in a range of 100 to 6 000 μS/cm, one can obtain precipitated calcium carbonate showing other crystal habits than those known from prior art processes which only lead to cubic or cuboidal PCCs. For example, one can obtain prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate and scalenohedral calcium carbonate. Another advantage of the present invention consists in that there is no need for the introduction of seeds to the reaction contents in order to obtain the desired crystal habit of the resulting precipitated calcium carbonate. The pH of the aqueous slurry of the precipitated calcium carbonate is preferably in the range of 7 to 13, and more preferably in the range of 7 to 12. It is noted that the pH value can be used as an indirect indication of the electrical conductivity of the reaction contents, i.e. high pH means a high concentration of free OH−-ions, and can help control the crystal habit of the resulting precipitated calcium carbonate. However, it is stressed that the measurement of the average electrical conductivity has to be regarded as a more precise tool for the control of the crystal habit of the resulting precipitated calcium carbonate. In an embodiment of the inventive process, the addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry in step c) is at least 0.02 fold/minute per volume of carbonated aqueous phase, and preferably in the range of 0.02 to 0.25 fold/minute per volume of carbonated aqueous phase, and more preferably in the range of 0.025 to 0.10 fold/minute per volume of carbonated aqueous phase, for example 0.05 fold/minute per volume of carbonated aqueous phase, or 0.075 fold/minute per volume of carbonated aqueous phase or 0.10 fold/minute per volume of carbonated aqueous phase. These addition rates lead to average conductivities in the range of 100 to 6 000 μS/cm. Moreover, by these addition rates the pH of the precipitated calcium carbonate can be controlled to be in a range of 7 to 13. For the purpose of the present invention the term “fold/minute per volume of carbonated aqueous phase” refers to the addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry and is independent of the size of the reaction vessel. The unit of this addition rate is usually expressed in 1/min. For example, when the volume of carbonated aqueous phase is 2 liters, then an addition rate in the range of 0.02 to 0.25 fold/minute per volume of carbonated aqueous phase corresponds to an addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry of 0.04 to 0.5 l/min. In the case of 8 liters of carbonated aqueous phase, the addition rate in the range of 0.02 to 0.25 fold/minute per volume of carbonated aqueous phase corresponds to an addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry of 0.16 to 2.0 l/min. In a preferred embodiment of the inventive process, the carbon dioxide generating compound in step c) is introduced in the reaction vessel at a rate of 0.05 to 2 kg CO2/h per kg of dry Ca(OH)2, and preferably between 0.2 to 0.8 kg CO2/h per kg of dry Ca(OH)2. Preferably, the reaction vessel used has a defined filling volume, and the total amount or volume of calcium hydroxide slurry added in step c) amounts to at least 10% of the filling volume of the reaction vessel. The advantage of this consists in that the resulting precipitated calcium carbonate slurry has a high solid content. Consequently, there is no need to further concentrate the final product before selling it. However, if required, then the aqueous suspension comprising the precipitated calcium carbonate can be submitted to further post treatments, comprising separating, filtering, and drying, in order to obtain the dried precipitated calcium carbonate, or milling. In another embodiment, the initial temperature of the aqueous phase is in a range of about 0 to about 95° C., and preferably in a range of about 10 to about 70° C., and more preferably in a range of about 30 to about 50° C. By an initial temperature of the aqueous phase of about 0° C. it is meant that the aqueous phase is in its fluid state and not in its solid state. In a further embodiment, the initial temperature of the calcium hydroxide slurry is in the range of about 10 to about 90° C., and preferably in the range of about 30 to about 80° C., and more preferably in the range of about 50 to about 70° C. It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that the initial temperature of the calcium hydroxide slurry and the water used is not necessarily the same one as in the reactor during the reaction due to the mixing temperature when mixing substances of different temperatures. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the carbon dioxide generating compound used is selected from among gaseous carbon dioxide, liquid carbon dioxide, solid carbon dioxide and a gas containing carbon dioxide, and preferably the carbon dioxide generating compound is a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and air, or carbon dioxide and nitrogen. When the gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and air or the gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen is used, then the carbon dioxide is present in the range of 8 to 99% by volume, and preferably in the range of 12 to 25% by volume, for example 20% by volume. The calcium hydroxide slurry is preferably an aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry and has a solid content of between 1 and 30% by weight, preferably between 5 and 25% by weight, and more preferably between 10 and 20% by weight. In yet a preferred embodiment of the invention, the suspension of the aqueous slurry of the precipitated calcium carbonate obtained in step (c) has a solid content between 5 and 30% by weight, preferably between 7 and 25% by weight, and more preferably between 10 and 20% by weight. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the precipitated calcium carbonate has a weight median grain diameter (d50) in a range of about 1.0 to about 9.0 μm, preferably in the range of about 2.5 to 7.5 μm, and most preferably in the range of 3.3 to 6.9 μm. By the present invention it is possible to obtain precipitated calcium carbonate particles having a weight median grain diameter (d50) in the range of 2.5 to 7.5 μm, and more preferable in the range of 3.3 to 6.9 μm. This means that by the present invention it is possible to obtain rather coarse precipitated calcium carbonate particles. The precipitated calcium carbonate particles obtained by the process according to the present invention have a BET specified surface area in a range of about 1.0 to about 25.0 m2/g, preferably in the range of about 1.3 to about 23.5 m2/g, and more preferably in the range of about 1.3 to 5.0 m2/g. In a further embodiment of the present invention, an additive is added to the reaction vessel after step a) or after step b) but prior to step c). The additive is preferably one selected from the group comprising slaking additives, and precipitation additives that are well known to the person skilled in the art. Examples of the additive are sugars, e.g. sucrose, sugar alcohols, e.g. meritol, citric acid or sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium salts of citric acid, and polyacrylic acids in their neutralized or partly neutralized forms. It is also noted that besides the afore-mentioned polyacrylic acids in their neutralized or partly neutralized forms other dispersing agents that are well known to the person skilled in the art can also be used as additives in the process of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the average conductivity is controlled in a range of about 100 to about 1 200 μS/cm, and preferably in a range of about 200 to about 1 010 μS/cm. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the average conductivity is controlled in range of greater than about 1 200 to about 6 000 μS/cm, and preferably in a range of about 1 300 to about 3 000 μS/cm, and more preferably in a range of about 1 300 to 2 500 μS/cm. The inventors have surprisingly found that when the average electrical conductivity of the reaction contents is in a range of about 100 to about 1 200 μS/cm, then the resulting precipitated calcium carbonate is prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate (P-PCC), and that when the average electrical conductivity of reaction contents is in a range of greater than about 1 200 to about 6 000 μS/cm, then the resulting precipitated calcium carbonate is scalenohedral precipitated calcium carbonate (S—PCC) or colloidal precipitate calcium carbonate (c-PCC). It is noted that the colloidal precipitated calcium carbonate is preferably formed during the process of the invention when there is an additive, such as a sugar, e.g. sucrose, present in the tab water prior to the introduction of calcium hydroxide slurry. In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the process is either carried out in a batch mode, a semi-batch mode or a continuous mode. In addition, the inventive process preferably comprises a further step where the precipitated calcium carbonate obtained in step c) is dried to form precipitated calcium carbonate. Another advantage of the present invention is the pH stability of the resulting precipitated calcium carbonate, which is stable in a broad pH range of 7 to 12. The present invention is also directed to the precipitated calcium carbonate obtained by the inventive process as well as directed to an aqueous suspension comprising the precipitated calcium carbonate obtained by the inventive process. Moreover, the present invention is directed to a dried precipitated calcium carbonate obtained by the inventive process. The invention is also directed to the use of the aqueous suspension in coating formulations or as fillers in the papermaking industry and to the use of the dried precipitated calcium carbonate in the field of paints, rubber, plastics, building materials, inks, water treatment, food, feed, and cosmetic. EXAMPLES The following examples are intended to illustrate certain embodiments of the invention and are understood to be non-limiting to the invention in any way. For the purpose of the present invention, the value of the parameter d50(%) is obtained by particle size measurements for which respectively 50% by mass of the particles have a diameter of less than or equal to this value. Measurement Methods: Suspension Conductivity Measurement The conductivity of the suspension was measured directly in the reaction vessel during the reaction using a Mettler Toledo Seven Multi equipped with the corresponding Mettler Toledo conductivity expansion unit and a Mettler Toledo InLab® 730 conductivity probe. The instrument was first calibrated in the relevant conductivity range using commercially available conductivity calibration solutions from Mettler Toledo. The influence of temperature on conductivity is automatically corrected by the linear correction mode. Suspension pH Measurement The pH of the suspension was measured directly in the reaction vessel using a Mettler Toledo Seven Easy pH meter and a Mettler Toledo InLab® Expert Pro pH electrode. BET Specific Surface Area The BET specific surface area (also designated as SSA) was determined according to ISO 9277 using a Tristar II 3020 sold by the company MICROMERITICS™. Particle size distribution (mass % particles with a diameter<X μm) and weight median particle diameter (d50) of particulate material (d50 (μm)) Sedigraph™ 5100. The weight median particle diameter and the particle diameter mass distribution of a particulate material were determined via the sedimentation method, i.e. an analysis of sedimentation behavior in a gravimetric field. The measurement is made with a Sedigraph™ 5100 sold by the company MICROMERITICS™. The method and the instrument are known to the skilled person and are commonly used to determine particle size of fillers and pigments. Samples were prepared by adding an amount of the product corresponding to 4 g dry PCC to 60 ml of an aqueous solution of 0.1% by weight of Na4P2O7. The samples were dispersed for 3 minutes using a high speed stirrer (Polytron PT 3000/3100 at 15 000 rpm). Then it was submitted to ultrasound using an ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes and thereafter added to the mixing chamber of the Sedigraph. Viscosity Measurements A. Brookfield Viscosity The Brookfield viscosity was measured after 1 minute of stirring by the use of a RVT model Brookfield™ viscometer at room temperature and a rotation speed of 100 rpm (revolutions per minute) with the appropriate disc spindle 2, 3 or 4. B. ICI Viscosity According to EN ISO 2884-1 The ICI viscosity was measured according to EN ISO 2884-1 using a cone- and plate viscometer (Epprecht Instruments+Controls, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) at a shear rate of 10 000 l/s at a temperature of (23±0.2)° C. The measured value after 15 s, which should be a constant value, depicts the measured viscosity of the probe. C. Viscosity with a Paar Physica M301 PP25 Rheometer This measurement was conducted with a Paar Physica M301 PP25 rheometer, from the company Anton Paar GmbH, Austria, according to the following regime: Temp.: 23° C. Starting shear rate: 0.1 l/s End shear rate: 100 l/s, with a gradient of 10 measurement points per decade, and each measurement point taken after 5 seconds. The measurement points are displayed in a decadic logarithmic manner, so that a linear curve with a negative slope results from this measurement. The x-axis of the graph represents the shear rate in a decadic logarithmic manner, and the y-axis depicts the measured viscosity in Pa·s. Weight Solids (% by Weight) of a Material in Suspension The weight solids (also called solids content of a material) was determined by dividing the weight of the solid material by the total weight of the aqueous suspension. The weight of the solid material was determined by weighing the solid material obtained by evaporating the aqueous phase of the suspension and drying the obtained material to a constant weight. Gloss of a Coated Surface The Gloss values are measured at the listed angles according to DIN 67 530 on painted surfaces prepared with a coater gap of 150 μm on contrast cards. The contrast cards used are Leneta contrast cards, form 3-B-H, size 7⅝×11⅜ (194×289 mm), sold by the company Leneta, and distributed by Novamart, Stäfa, Switzerland. The gloss is measured with a gloss measurement device from the company Byk Gardner, Geretsried, Germany. The gloss is obtained by measuring 5 different points on the card with the gloss measurement device, and the average value is calculated by the device and can be derived from the display of the device. Determination of Colour Values (Rx, Ry, Rz) The colour values Rx, Ry, Rz are determined over the white and black fields of the Leneta contrast card, and are measured with a spectraflas SF 450× spectrophotomer of the company Datacolor, Montreuil, France. Contrast Ratio (Opacity) of a Coated Surface Contrast ratio values are determined according to ISO 2814 at a spreading rate of 7.5 m2/l. The contrast ratio is calculated as described by the equation below: Contrast ⁢ ⁢ ratio ⁢ [ % ] = Ry black Ry white × 100 ⁢ % with Ryblack and Rywhite being obtained by the measurement of the colour values. Example 1 Comparative Example This example describes a process of the prior art for the production of cuboidal PCC, where the PCC is prepared by the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,888,160. The same recycle piping system as disclosed in FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,888,160 was used. A 8 liter reactor was filled with 2 liters of water having an initial temperature of 30° C. Then, the water was re-circulated through the recycle piping system. Carbon dioxide gas (100 Vol. %) was injected into the recycle stream at a turbulent area in the recycle piping system at a rate of 2.5 l/min. The carbon dioxide injection was continued until the pH of the water was 6.0. While the carbon dioxide injection was continued, 6 l of an aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was pumped into the reactor at a rate so that the pH of the resultant reaction mixture was maintained between 8 and 9. The resultant cuboidal calcium carbonate product has a weight median grain diameter (d50) of 4.2 μm and a BET specific surface area (SSA) of 2.2 m2/g. Example 2 Inventive Example This example demonstrates the production of a prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate (P-PCC) using the process of the present invention. In this example an 8 liter stainless steel reactor was used. The reaction vessel was closed on the top and enables a gas injection from the bottom of the vessel and injection of calcium hydroxide slurry from the top of the vessel. 2 liters of tap water were provided in the reaction vessel. The initial temperature of the water prior to the gas injection was about 30° C. Gas containing carbon dioxide was injected into the tap water contained in the reaction vessel at a rate of 15 l/min until the pH of the water was approximately 6. The contents of the reaction vessel were stirred at a 1 200 rpm. While the injection of the carbon dioxide containing gas was continued, an aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry, the so-called “milk of lime”, was added. The initial temperature of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was about 70° C. The solids content of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was about 14% by weight. The addition rate of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was such that the pH of the slurry in the reaction vessel was about 11. The average conductivity of the reactor contents was about 832 μS/cm. The resultant precipitated calcium carbonate was a coarse prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate (coarse P-PCC) with a weight median grain diameter (d50) of 5.5 μm and a BET specific surface area (SSA) of 1.4 m2/g. Example 3 Inventive Example In this example the same reactor as in Example 2 was used. Moreover, the reaction was carried out in a similar manner as the reaction described in Example 2. The 2 liters of tap water provided in the reaction vessel had an initial temperature prior to the gas injection of about 30° C. The initial temperature of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry in this example was also about 30° C. The addition rate of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was controlled by a flow of 0.07 l/min. The average conductivity of the reactor contents during the reaction was about 200 μS/cm, and the pH of the slurry during and after the reaction was about 7. The resultant precipitated calcium carbonate was a rather coarse prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate with a weight median grain diameter (d50) of 3.0 μm and a BET specific surface area (SSA) of 2.9 m2/g. Example 4 Inventive Example Example 4 was carried out in a similar manner to the reaction described in Example 3, with the exception that the initial temperature of both the tap water and the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was about 50° C. The average conductivity of the reactor contents during the reaction was about 200 μS/cm. The pH of the slurry in the reaction vessel was about 7. The resultant precipitated calcium carbonate was a rather coarse prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate with a weight median grain diameter (d50) of 2.9 μm and a BET specific surface area (SSA) of 2.7 m2/g. Example 5 Inventive Example Example 5 was carried out in a similar manner to the reaction described in Example 3, with the exception that the initial temperature of the tap water was about 10° C. and the initial temperature of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was about 70° C. The average conductivity of the reactor contents during the reaction was about 200 μS/cm. The pH of the slurry in the reaction vessel was about 7. The resultant precipitated calcium carbonate was a rather coarse prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate with a weight median grain diameter (d50) of 3.8 μm and a BET specific surface area (SSA) of 3.8 m2/g. Example 6 Inventive Example Example 6 was carried out in a similar manner to the reaction described in Example 2, with the exception that the addition rate of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was such that the average conductivity of the reactor contents during the reaction was about 245 μS/cm. The pH of the slurry in the reaction vessel was about 7.5. The resultant precipitated calcium carbonate was a rather coarse prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate with a weight median grain diameter (d50) of 3.1 μm and a BET specific surface area (SSA) of 2.7 m2/g. Example 7 Inventive Example Example 7 was carried out in a similar manner to the reaction described in Example 2, with the exception that the solid content of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was about 21% by weight instead of about 14% by weight. The average conductivity of the reactor contents during the reaction was about 835 μS/cm. The resultant precipitated calcium carbonate was a very coarse prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate with a weight median grain diameter (d50) of 6.0 μm and a BET specific surface area (SSA) of 2.0 m2/g. Example 8 Inventive Example—Dispersing Agent Example 8 was carried out in a similar manner to the reaction described in Example 2, with the exception that a dispersing agent was added to the tap water prior to the addition of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry. The dispersing agent used was a polyacrylic acid in its neutralized form (having a Mw=12 000 and a polydispersity of 4), and it was added in an amount of 0.02% by weight, based on the dry amount of calcium hydroxide. The average conductivity of the reactor contents during the reaction was about 881 μS/cm. The resultant precipitated calcium carbonate was a very coarse prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate with a weight median grain diameter (d50) of 6.9 μm and a BET specific surface area (SSA) of 1.5 m2/g.

In this example a 1 800 liter stainless steel pilot plant reactor was used. 600 l of tap water were provided in the reaction vessel. The initial temperature of the water prior to the gas injection was about 30° C.

No. 4,888,160. Inventive Examples 2 to 9, and 17 to 19, 22, 23 and 24 demonstrate the production of prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate (P-PCC). From these results one can clearly derive that when the average conductivity is controlled to be in the range of about 100 to about 1 200 μS/cm, then the resulting PCC has a prismatic crystal habit. Besides, inventive Example 17 demonstrates that the addition rate of the calcium hydroxide slurry can be clearly controlled by the measurement of electrical conductivity of the reaction contents. The set point of the electrical conductivity was 1 000 μS/cm, and the observed electrical conductivity was 1 034 μS/cm. Furthermore, inventive Examples 18 and 19 demonstrate that additives can be used during the preparation of the Ca(OH)2 slurry as well as during the inventive process without changing the crystal structure of the resulting PCC. Inventive Examples 10 to 14 demonstrate the production of scalenohedral precipitated calcium carbonate (S-PCC). Again, one can clearly derive that when the average electrical conductivity is controlled to be in the range of greater than about 1 200 to about 6 000 μS/cm, then the resulting PCC has a scalenohedral crystal habit. Inventive Example 15 demonstrates the production of colloidal precipitated calcium carbonate (C-PCC). One can clearly derive that when the average electrical conductivity is controlled to be in the range of greater than about 1 200 to about 6 000 μS/cm, and an additive such as a sugar, e.g. sucrose, is added to the tap water prior to the addition of the calcium hydroxide slurry, then the resulting PCC is in colloidal form. In addition, inventive Example 16, and Examples 22 and 23 demonstrate the feasibility of the inventive process in pilot scale and industrial scale, respectively. Furthermore, Examples 20 and 21 exemplify the production of scalenohedral precipitated calcium carbonate by the commonly known process where first the calcium hydroxide slurry is introduced into the reaction vessel and then the introduction of carbon dioxide containing gas is started. As one can clearly derive from these trials, the precipitated calcium carbonate shows a smaller average mean particle size than the products obtained by the process according to the present invention. Finally, Example 24 exemplifies the continuous production of scalenohedral precipitated calcium carbonate in pilot scale. Last but not least, the present invention relates to the use of the aqueous suspension or the dried precipitated calcium carbonate obtained by the inventive process in coating formulations or as fillers in the papermaking industry. Use of the Precipitated Calcium Carbonate in Paint Applications Example 25 A. Production of Prismatic Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (P-PCC) The aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry used was obtained by slaking burnt lime (calcium oxide) with 0.1% sodium citrate at a burnt lime/water ratio of 1:6. The solid content of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was adjusted to about 16 wt.-%, based on the dry weight of the calcium oxide, in a manner known by the skilled person. In this example a 2 400 liter stainless steel pilot plant reactor was used. 600 l of tap water were provided in the reaction vessel. The initial temperature of the water prior to the gas injection was about 50° C. Gas containing 20% by volume carbon dioxide was injected at a rate of 200 m3/h into the tap water contained in the reaction vessel over a period of 2 minutes. The reaction vessel contents were agitated at 240 rpm. While the injection of the carbon dioxide containing gas was continued, the above described aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was added to the reaction vessel until 100% of the reactor was filled. The initial temperature of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was about 50° C. The addition rate of the aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry was such that the pH of the slurry in the reaction vessel was maintained between 7 and about 7.5. B. Post-Processing of the Prismatic Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (P-PCC) Obtained Under A The prismatic precipitated calcium carbonate obtained under A. was post-processed by the means of two different methods. 1. Post-Processing on a Pilot Centrifuge The slurry obtained in step A was first screened on a 45 μm screen, and then dewatered with a centrifuge of the SC 01 type of the company KHD Humboldt Wedag A D, Köln, Germany, to a solids content of about 70 wt. %. 2. Post-Processing on a Tube Press The slurry obtained in step A was first screened on a 45 μm screen, then dewatered with a Metso Tube Press 500 SC-100 of the company Metso to a solids content of about 83 wt. %. By the use of an appropriate dispersant, the filter cake was redispersed in a Lab Ultramill to a solids content of about 72-74 wt. %. C.
