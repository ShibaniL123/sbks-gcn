PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS OF DABIGATRAN FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a first component comprising dabigatran or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the form of a tablet and a second component comprising an organic acid. The invention also relates to processes for the preparation of such compositions and using those compositions to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non- valvular atrial fibrillation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dabigatran etexilate is known as (3-[(2-{[4-(hexyloxycarbonylamino-imino-methyl)- phenylaminoj-methyl ' - 1 -methyl- 1 H-benzimidazole-5-carbonyl)-pyridine-2~yl- amino]-propionic acid ethyl ester) and it has the following chemical structural formula: Dabigatran etexilate is already known from PCT Publication No. WO 1998/37075. which discloses compounds with a thrombin-inhibiting effect and the effect of prolonging the thrombin time. The solubility o dabigatran in water is only 1.8 mg/ml. Moreover, dabigatran has a strong pH-dependent solubility thai is greatly increased in the acidic environment. This leads to the problem that conventional oral pharmaceutical compositions have large variations in the bioavailability since the solubility of the active ingredient depends on the pH value in the patient's stomach. This is particularly problematic with patients in whom the stomach pH value is changed by physiological variability. illness, or premedications (for example, proton pump inhibitors). PCT Publication No. WO 2005/018615 discloses a tablet comprising dabigatran etexilate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; one or more pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids with solubility in water of more than I g/250ml at 20°C and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or tiller. However, the presence of an organic acid in close contact with the active in a tablet composition, without any special steps taken to separate the two from each other, can make the active highly susceptible to hydrolysis in the presence of humidity. PCT Publication No. WO 2003/074056 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids having a water solubility of >l g/250 ml at 20°C. wherein the active ingredient layer is applied on an organic acid core while spatially separating the organic acid and active ingredient by an insulating layer.

The composition as described comprises mixing dabigatran with the inorganic acidic excipient and optionally compressing the mixture to tablets or filling the mixture into capsules. PCT Publication No. WO 2013/110567 discloses an oral pharmaceutical composition comprising dabigatran etexilate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one water soluble cyclodextrin agent as an excipient. PCT Publication No. WO 2013/124340 discloses dabigatran etexilate compositions comprising a mixture of at least two types of particles and optionally at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. wherein a) the first type of particles comprise the active agent; b) the second type of particles comprise at least one pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid; and c) optionally at least one type of particles are coated with a protective coating layer.

The current invention encompasses process of preparing compositions of dabigatran, comprising a first component comprising dabigatran and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in the form of a tablet and a second component comprising an organic acid and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprises a first component contained in a tablet characterized by the presence of dabigatran, and a second component characterized by the presence of an organic acid, wherein the composition is prepared by a process comprising: a) determining specific amounts of the first and second components necessary to produce the final composition; and b) incorporating the specified amounts of the components into the composition. Another embodiment describes a pharmaceutical composition wherein the first component comprising dabigatran is in the form of a tablet and the second component comprising an organic acid is in the form of a tablet, granules, beads, pellets, powder, particles, agglomerates, microspheres, minitablets, microcapsules. In another embodiment, there is provided a process lor preparing the first component, wherein the component is in the form of a tablet, wherein the process comprises the steps: a) mixing dabigatran with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, b) granulating the mixture obtained in a granulator or by top spray granulation, c) drying the granules followed by blending, lubrication and compression to obtain the first component; and d) optionally coating the first component. In another embodiment, there is provided a process for preparing the first component, wherein the component is in the form of a tablet, wherein the process comprises the steps: a) mixing dabigatran with a diluent, a binder and a disintegrant and other suitable pharmaceutical excipients followed by compression to form the first component; and b) optionally coating the first component. In another embodiment, there is provided a process for preparing the second component, wherein the process comprises the steps: a) top spraying the organic acid using coating agents and one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients to form a wet mass, b) drying the wet mass to obtain granules; and c) sieving the granules followed by blending and lubrication. In another embodiment, there is provided a process for preparing the second component, wherein the process comprises the steps: a) blending at least one organic acid and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, b) extruding the blend of step 'a' to form extrudates. c) spheronizing the extrudates to form organic acid pellets: and d) coating the organic acid pellets with a coating layer. In another embodiment, there is provided a process for preparing the second component, wherein the process comprises coating the inert organic acid beads with a coating layer. In another embodiment, there is provided a process for preparing the second component, wherein the process comprises the steps: a) blending at least one organic acid and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, b) granulating the blend of step 'a' with a binder solution to form organic acid granules; and c) coating the granules with a coating layer. Without bein bound by any particular theory, the smoothness (or roughness) of the coating layer can enhance solvent evaporation from the surface and decreases the amount of surface residual solvent, in doing so reducing the amount of solvent which may cause organic acid leaching and possible interaction and subsequent degradation ofdabigatran due to hydrolysis or other means. The coating layer may provide a weight gain from about 5% to about 30%, more preferably, from about 10% to about 30% by weight of the organic acid beads. In another embodiment, the required quantities of two components prepared by any of the above mentioned techniques may be compressed into a tablet, filled into pouches, encapsulated into a capsule of any desirable size, for example, a size 000, 00. Oel, 0, 1.2, 3, 4, or 5 to provide a final dosage form. Components of a suitable capsule shell include, but are not limited to, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and gelatin. Preferably, a capsule shell is a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) shell. Typically, commercially available HP C capsules include small amounts of water, colorants (e.g., Ti02 and iron oxides), and optionally gelling agents and gelling promoters. They have relatively low moisture content, making them suitable for moisture-sensitive materials. Such capsules resist breakage even at low moisture levels. However, the capsules of cellulose ether film suffer from the problem that the gelling aid which is blended for assisting in film formation will precipitate out on the film surface during long-term storage. During long-term storage of these cellulose ether film capsules, the water content of the film can be lowered owing to the storage environment or the water absorption of the fill. Then the potassium or calcium ions as the gelling aid re-form potassium chloride or calcium chloride which precipitates out on the film surface. Patent no. US 6.649.180 suggests means to overcome this problem by limiting the total content of alkoxyl and hydroxyalkoxyl groups in the cellulose ether to 37.6% by weight. More particularly, the total content corresponds to the total content of methoxyl groups (abbreviated as "MO groups") and hydroxypropoxyl groups (abbreviated as "HPO groups") in the case of HPMC is considered. However, surprisingly the compositions of the present invention were found to be physically and organoleptically stable during the entire stability conditions i.e., the capsule shells showed no signs of white precipitates. HPMC capsule shells used for the present invention preferably comprise methoxyl groups and hydroxypropoxyl groups combined of 23 to 39% by weight of the hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose; more prelerably 30 to 39%, even more preferably .37 to 39% and still more preferably 37.7 to 39%. In another embodiment, the compositions of the present invention provide a faster dabigatran release than available marketed composition, wherein it releases at least about 50%) dabigatran within 10 minutes, more preferably at least about 60% dabigatran within 10 minutes; releases at least about 90% dabigatran within 30 minutes, more preferably at least about 95% dabigatran within 30 minutes after subjecting said composition to dissolution testing in 0.0 IN HCI (900ml) at pH 2.0 according to the USP basket method at lOOrpm. In further embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are found to be stable and may retain at least 90% of the potency of dabigatran in the composition after storing the composition at 40° C and 75% relative humidity for at least three months. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition provides for a relative AUCn 24h, CIT 1X and Cm,,, in the range of 80% to 125%), as compared to Pradaxa*', the currently marketed composition in the USA..
