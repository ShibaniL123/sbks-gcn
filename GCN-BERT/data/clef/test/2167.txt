(8) Preparation of 5-chloro-N4-(2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N2-(6-methyl-7-(piperidin-4-yl)be nzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-yl)pyrimidine-2,4-diamine
Tert-butyl 4-(7-((5-chloro-4-((2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)amino)pyrimidin-2-yl)amino) -5-methylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-yl)piperidin-1-carboxylate (160 mg, 0.25 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL), and 10 mL trifluoroacetic acid was added. The resultant mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After the reaction, the resultant mixture was washed with sodium bicarbonate, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtrated, and concentrated to obtain the crude product. After silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane: methanol=10:1), the final product was obtained (70 mg, yield: 52%).
