CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application No. PCT/GB2011/000895 filed Jun. 14, 2011, entitled “A Process for the Preparation of Nateglinide,” which claims priority to Indian Patent Application No. 1793/MUM/2010 filed on Jun. 14, 2010, which applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of chirally-pure (−)-N-(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl-1-carbonyl)-D-phenylalanine (nateglinide). BACKGROUND Nateglinide is a new class of antidiabetic drug developed jointly by Ajinomoto Co. Inc. and Hoechest Marion Russel of Japan. Its blood sugar lowering effect is rapid following oral administration, since it is short-acting, it prevents hypoglycemia between meals. Nateglinide is indicated to lower blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes, where hypoglycemia cannot be adequately controlled by diet, physical exercise and α-glucosaccharase inhibitors. Nateglinide is chemically termed as (−)-N-(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl-1-carbonyl)-D-phenylalanine which is represented by the following formula (I). Nateglinide was first disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,486 (RE34878). US20060148902A1 describe hydrolysis of a nateglinide methyl ester in a mixture of water and toluene in the presence of phase transfer catalysts and KOH followed by addition of dilute HCl, filtration, and drying to afford Form B. U.S. Pat. No. 7,208,622 describes a process in which trans-4-isopropylcyclohexane carbonyl chloride (i.e. a derivative of trans-4-isopropylcyclohexane carboxylic acid) is reacted with D-phenylalanine in the presence of a caustic solution followed by acidification in a mixture of water and acetone and crystallization at 58-72° C. which results in Form H of nateglinide. Indian application 177/MAS/2003A discloses a process for preparing nateglinide comprising: condensation of D-phenyl alanine methyl ester with trans-4-isopropyl-cyclohexylcarboxylic acid chloride in the presence of a halo solvent such as chloroform and a base (TEA, triethylamine) followed by alkali metal hydrolysis in an alcoholic solvent such as isopropanol. The resulting nateglinide contains the cis isomer and the L-isomer in an amount <0.05%. However, on following the methodology as disclosed in examples 1 and 2, it was observed that, the L-isomer content does not go below 0.22%. This is due to the use of alkali metal hydroxide in the hydrolysis step at ambient temperature. Further, the use of isopropanol in example 2, yields isopropyl ester of nateglinide on acidification with hydrochloric acid. Further, excess D-phenyl alanine methyl ester may either lead to formation of dimeric impurity of formula (D) during coupling reaction or remains as impurity in the nateglinide ester which needs to be removed by HCl washing prior to hydrolysis. Indian application 2007/MUM/02380 discloses a process which involves treating an alkyl ester of D-phenylalanine or its acid addition salt with trans-4-isopropylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid halide under biphasic conditions in the presence of a base to give nateglinide alkyl ester, which is hydrolyzed to nateglinide having chiral purity 99.9-100.0%. US20070043117A1 discloses a process for the preparation of chirally pure nateglinide G, whereby after alkaline hydrolysis of nateglinide alkyl ester, in the mixture of methanol-water; mineral acid is added in two portions such that, in first place mixture of nateglinide base and its alkali salt is isolated whereas in the next step chirally pure nateglinide base is isolated. Thus the process requires two steps to isolate chirally pure nateglinide. Further, the mixture of nateglinide base and it's alkali salt is sticky in nature and hence filtration takes prolong time. Nateglinide preparation is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,463,116, US2004014815A, US2003229249A and WO2008096373. Most of the prior art methods use a combination of an alkali metal hydroxide and alcoholic solvents during hydrolysis of nateglinide and crystallization of nateglinide. The major drawback of using alcoholic solvents is that some of the nateglinide esterifies back to nateglinide alkyl ester. Further, nateglinide obtained by following the prior art process, is contaminated with cis-isomer, L-isomer, and/or N-(4-isopropyl benzoyl)-D-phenyl alanine (an ethyl analog of nateglinide and dimer impurity), hence repetitive purifications are required to obtain the purified product. This further, thus, reduces yield and purity of the product. Therefore there is a need to develop a process for the synthesis of nateglinide that overcomes the problems of prior art and that which is simple, cost effective, non-hazardous and industrially viable. OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparation of (−)-N-(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl-1-carbonyl)-D-phenylalanine (nateglinide) which is substantially free from related impurities, cis-isomer and L-enantiomer. Another object of the present invention is to provide an industrially-advantageous process for the preparation of pure nateglinide Form B.

FIG. 2 shows a characteristic differential scanning calorimetric thermogram of nateglinide Form B obtained by an embodiment of the process of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The process according to the present invention will now be described in more detail below. In a preferred embodiment, the process for the preparation of nateglinide according to the present invention is depicted in the reaction scheme below. [Bracket indicates intermediate that could be isolated in the integrated process]. Accordingly, in an embodiment, the present invention provides a process for the synthesis of substantially pure nateglinide of formula (I), the process comprising a first step (i) of esterification of D-phenyl alanine of compound of formula (V) with thionyl chloride in methanol to obtain D-phenyl alanine methyl ester compound of formula (IV) in a salt form (typically the hydrochloride) of formula (IVa) or the free base of formula (IVb). The esterification may involve reacting D-phenyl alanine with thionyl chloride in methanol at a temperature of 0-30° C., preferably at 5-10° C. for 12-15 hours. Use of thionyl chloride at a lower temperature of 0-30° C. results in a high yield of the ester of formula (IV), in comparison with other ester-forming methods of amino acids. It further helps in complete conversion of D-phenyl alanine and overall increase in the yield and purity as compared to sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid etc. Further, it reduces the number of reaction hours from 48-50 hours to 12 hours. After completion of the reaction, the compound of formula (IV) may be isolated as a hydrochloride salt (IVa) by evaporation of solvent which can either be used directly in the next condensing step or can be further converted to its free base of formula (IVb) by neutralizing the salt with a suitable reagent, for example aqueous ammonia, prior to the reaction with trans-4-isopropyl-cyclohexylcarboxylic acid. Preferably, in the process of the present invention, the compound of formula (IV) is isolated as free base (IVb) without isolation of salt of formula (IVa) which may be taken up for condensing reaction. In an embodiment, step (ii) comprises condensation of the D-phenyl alanine methyl ester compound of formula (IV) with trans-4-isopropyl-cyclohexylcarboxylic acid of formula (III) using a suitable condensing agent in the presence of a suitable solvent to form an amide (−)-N-(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl-1-carbonyl)-D-phenylalanine methyl ester of formula (II). In the prior art processes, the amine of formula (IV) is coupled with a derivative of trans-4-isopropyl-cyclohexylcarboxylic acid of formula (III) such as trans-4-isopropyl-cyclohexylcarboxylic acid chloride or the N-hydroxysuccinmide ester of trans-4-isopropyl-cyclohexylcarboxylic acid. This involves the use of an expensive reagent such as N-hydroxysuccinimide. In an embodiment, D-phenyl alanine methyl ester compound of formula (IV) is directly coupled with trans-4-isopropyl-cyclohexylcarboxylic acid of formula (III) without intermediate conversion to an acid chloride or an N-hydroxysuccinmide ester, of formula (III). The coupling is suitably carried out in the presence of a condensing reagent and an inert organic solvent, to obtain nateglinide ester of formula (II). Thus the process step avoids the use of an expensive reagent such as N-hydroxysuccinimide. Also, it reduces the number of synthetic steps, which is a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Further, the prior art processes use excess moles of amine which may either lead to formation of dimeric impurity of formula (D), during the coupling reaction or remain as contaminant in nateglinide ester which needs to be removed before the hydrolysis step. However, in a preferred embodiment of the process of present invention, the molar ratio of 4-isopropyl-cyclohexylcarboxylic acid (III) is in excess of that of the amine of formula (IV), which avoids formation of dimer (D). Further, excess acid can be easily removed by alkali wash or by purification in suitable solvent. And this forms another preferred embodiment of the present invention. A suitable condensing reagent in step (ii) according to the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of phenylsilane, 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), benzotriazol-1-yloxytris (dimethylamino) phophonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), 1-hydroxy benzotriazole hydrate (HOBt), PyBOP (Analog of the BOP), 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), 1,4-dithio-L-threitol (DTT), N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodidimide hydrochloride (EDC HCl), 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate (HATU), 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), 2-(6-chloro-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminiumhexafluorophosphate (HCTU), O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetra methyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), tetramethylfluoroformamidiniunhexafluorophosphate (TFFH) and mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, DCC is used in combination with HOBT to increase the overall coupling power. It was observed that use of HOBT in the coupling reaction prevents racemization; whereas in the absence of HOBt, the L-isomer content increases to 1.5%. Preferably, 0.1 to 0.5 molar equivalents and more preferably 0.3 molar equivalents of HOBt per mole of compound of formula (IV), is used in the coupling reaction. A suitable inert organic solvent for step (ii) according to the present invention, is selected from the group consisting of a halogenated (solvent such as chloroform, or dichloromethane (MDC)); a polar solvent (such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl pyrrolidone, sulfolane, diglyme, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, acetone); and mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, a halogenated solvent is used. The process is carried out at a suitable temperature preferably until amine of formula (IV) is undetectable. Preferably, the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of −5 to 30° C., more preferably at a temperature in the range of 10 to 15° C. After completion of the reaction, the excess acid of formula (III) and HOBT are removed by washing with alkali. Suitably, the alkali is an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, barium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide. The alkali may also be an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, potassium carbonate or aqueous ammonia. Preferably, the alkali is an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. Nateglinide methyl ester of formula (II) is easily isolated from the reaction mixture, for example by distilling off excess solvent and isolating in a non-polar solvent. Suitably, the non-polar solvent is selected from toluene, n-hexane, n-heptane, 1,4-dioxane, chloroform or diethyl ether. Preferably, the non-polar solvent is n-hexane. It was observed that when coupling reaction is carried out without isolation of salt of D-phenyl alanine methyl ester compound of formula (IVa), it may retain same amount of L-isomer in the nateglinide methyl ester of formula (II). This L-isomer content is more when compared with coupling reaction carried out by isolation of salt of D-phenyl alanine methyl ester compound of formula (IVa). This indicates that purity of D-phenyl alanine methyl ester compound of formula (IV) has no effect on additional increase in the L-isomer content in the coupling step. In other words coupling step does not induce racemization. Alternatively, in the process of the present invention, the coupling reaction can be carried out without isolating the salt of D-phenyl alanine methyl ester compound of formula (IV). In an embodiment, the process further comprises step (iii): purification of (−)-N-(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl-1-carbonyl)-D-phenylalanine methyl ester of formula (II) in a C1-C4 alcohol, preferably methanol. In step (iii) of the present invention, nateglinide methyl ester of formula (II) so formed is further purified in a suitable solvent so as to reduce the impurities and L-isomer to a desired level before proceeding to the hydrolysis step. Accordingly, nateglinide ester of formula (II) is purified in a C1-C4 alcoholic solvent. Preferably the purification is best conducted in methanol. Advantageously, the use of methanol for purification reduces all related impurities to below 0.1%. In an embodiment, the process further comprises step (iv): hydrolysis of (−)-N-(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl-1-carbonyl)-D-phenyl alanine methyl ester of formula (II) in a suitable polar aprotic solvent or water or mixture thereof, to obtain nateglinide of formula (I) substantially free from related impurities, especially cis and L-enantiomers. It was observed that the formation of L-isomer takes place either at esterification step (i) or at hydrolysis step (iv). The amount of L-isomer could be reduced either by isolation of compound of formula (IV) or by purifying nateglinide ester of formula (II). However, it was surprisingly found that, the formation of L-isomer in step (iv) is solvent and temperature specific and could be reduced to desired level using appropriate solvent mixture. Thus in the step (iv) of the present invention, hydrolysis of (−)-N-(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl-1-carbonyl)-D-phenylalanine methyl ester of formula (II) is carried out using alkali metal hydroxide, in the presence of a polar aprotic solvent or water or mixture thereof. Suitably, the alkali metal hydroxide is selected from sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, caecium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, barium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide, preferably sodium hydroxide. Preferably, the polar aprotic solvent is selected from ketone, THF, DMF, DMSO, acetonitrile or ethyl acetate, most preferably a ketone. It was observed that ketonic solvents, more preferably acetone, either alone or in combination with water, control L-isomer formation. Thus in the preferred embodiment, acetone is used in combination with water to increase overall solvent power. The acetone and water ratio varies from 5:1 to 1:1, but preferably ratio of 1:1 is used. Preferably, the hydrolysis reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of 0-40° C., more preferably at a temperature in the range of 10-15° C. The reaction mass is then acidified to pH 2-3 with HCl at around 10° C. to obtain nateglinide of formula (I). Nateglinide isolated by filtration and subsequent drying at 80° C., is substantially free of cis isomer and L-enantiomer. In an embodiment, the term “substantially free of” in the specification refers to nateglinide having purity (measured by HPLC) above 99.5%, preferably above about 99.7%, and more preferably above about 99.8%. The precipitated solid is further dried at 80° C. under vacuum until the moisture content is below 0.5% to provide nateglinide in high yield and purity. Both the solvent composition and the temperature of reaction mass during hydrolysis plays an important role in obtaining the desired polymorphic form and also useful in non-racemization of the resulting nateglinide. In the preferred embodiment, the nateglinide of formula (I) obtained by the process of the present invention has less than 0.5% of N-(cis-4-isopropylcyclohexyl-1-carbonyl)-D-phenylalanine, preferably less than 0.3% and more preferably less than 0.2%. In yet another preferred embodiment, the nateglinide of formula (I) obtained by the process of the present invention has less than 0.5% of N-(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl-1-carbonyl)-L-phenylalanine, preferably less than 0.3% and more preferably less than 0.2%. Nateglinide of formula (I) obtained by the process of present invention is in the pure form B substantially free from other polymorphs. No further purification or crystallization is required to prepare pure nateglinide polymorphic form B. This forms another embodiment of the present invention. Nateglinide thus isolated is of pharmaceutical grade having L-isomer content below 0.1% and having physiochemical characteristics corresponding to form B of nateglinide. Throughout the specification (including in the examples): Efficiency is equal to practical yield/theoretical yield expressed as a percentageChiral purity is measured by HPLC.The % of L-isomer is measured by HPLC and is expressed as area %.
