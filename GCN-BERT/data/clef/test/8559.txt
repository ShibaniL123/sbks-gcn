The present invention relates to methods to detect an amount of DNA that originates from cells of a given type, where the sample comprising such DNA in admixture with DNA that does not originate from such cells. Such methods are based on differential methylation, at certain regions, of the DNA that originates from the given type of cells compared to the admixed DNA. Such methods have particular application in the detection, from a biological fluid from a pregnant female, of cell free DNA that originates from a foetus or the placenta of a foetus, or the detection, from a biological fluid from an individual, of cell free DNA that originates from cells of a tumour. Accordingly, such methods have diagnostic, prognostic and/or predictive utility for detecting an increased risk of an individual suffering from or developing a medical condition such as preeclampsia or cancer, and/or to aid subsequent diagnostic, prognostic and/or predictive methods such as the detection of chromosomal trisomy in a foetus, including for twin-pregnancies. The present invention also relates to compositions, kits, computer program products and other aspects that are used in, useful for or related to the practice of such methods. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), especially that found in plasma or serum, has been the subject of considerable research over the past decade. Despite the original finding of circulating cell-free nucleic acids in the bloodstream being described by Mandel and Metais as early as 1948 (Mandel and Metais 1948, CR Acad Sci Paris 142:241), it took until the mid 1990s for proof that tumours shed DNA into the circulatory system (Sorenson et al 1994, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 3:67; Vassioukhin et al 1994, Br J Haematol 86:774), and until 1997 for the discovery of cfDNA originating from a foetus in the circulatory system of the mother (Lo et al 1997, Lancet 350:485). Among other forms of characteristics shown by circulating cfDNA, numerous studies have described the presence of methylated circulating cfDNA in the plasma/serum and other body fluids of patients with various types of malignancy and the absence of methylated DNA in normal control patients (for review see Muller and Widschwendter 2003, Expert Rev Mol Diagn 3:443). Although other characteristics of circulating cfDNA exist and are important for diagnostic, prognostic or predictive studies (for example, sequence mutations and micro duplications/deletions), such methylation-based epigenetic characteristics have become an increasingly important source of serologic markers for diagnosis, risk assessment and even for therapy monitoring during follow-up of cancer patients. Likewise, the use of differences in foetal cfDNA present in the maternal circulation has been the main goal for the development of non-invasive prenatal tests (NIPT). Foetal cfDNA is derived from embryonic cell degradation in maternal peripheral blood (Lo et al 2000, Clin Chem 46:1301) or from apoptotic placental cells (Smid et al 2006, Prenat Diagn 26:785). It has been demonstrated that foetal cfDNA from maternal plasma is cleared immediately (within a few hours) after pregnancy (Lo et al 1999, Am J Hum Genet 64:218). This finding is of great importance, since the presence of foetal cfDNA from previous pregnancies would otherwise interfere with the correct interpretation of subsequent pregnancies. It is believed that 60% of tissue-specific differentially methylated regions are methylated in embryonic cells, while during the differentiation of embryonic tissues to adult tissues, they undergo de-methylation (Kawai et al 1993, Nucleic Acids Res 21:5604). Based on the evidence that foetal cfDNA in maternal plasma is of placental origin, epigenetic differences between maternal peripheral (whole) blood and placental DNA have been used to detect a hypomethylated gene sequence (maspin/SERPINB5) in maternal plasma derived from the foetus (Masuzaki et al 2004, J Med Genet 41:289; Fiori et al 2004, Hum Reprod 19:723; Chim et al 2005, Proc NatI Acad Sci USA 102:14753). Subsequently, a number of additional differential foetal methylation-based epigenetic molecular markers have been described, including the RASSF1A gene on chromosome 3, as well as a marker on chromosome 21 (Chiu et al 2007, Am J Pathol 170:941; Old et al 2007, Reprod Biomed Online 15:22; Chim et al 2008, Clin Chem 54:500) and others including T-box 3 (TBX3) (Nygren et al 2010, Clin Chem 65:10; WO 2010/033639; WO 2011/034631). Various methodologies exist for NIPT based on the analysis of foetal cfDNA. For example, foetal sex determination using eg DYS14 (Lo et al 1997; Lancet 350:485), as well as foetal Rhesus D found in maternal circulation in pregnancies in which the mother was Rhesus D negative (Lo 1998, N Eng J Med 339:1734). Also, and of particular relevance, are those using next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies on cfDNA isolated from maternal plasma with the primary aim of detecting the most common chromosomal aneuploidies as commercially available tests (for example, those using random massively parallel sequencing: www.sequenom.com; www.lifecodexx.com; www.verinata.com). Other technologies include targeted approaches, the aim of which is to enrich specific genomic regions of interest before sequencing to reduce the number of sequence tags needed to perform a reliable statistical analysis (eg www.ariosadx.com or www.natera.com), polymorphism analysis or digital PCR (for review, see Go et al 2011, Human Reprod Update 17:372). However, regardless of the specific technology used, current applications of NIPT rely on the qualitative detection of foetal cfDNA to determine the genetic makeup of the foetus. Such an approach leads to an analytic dilemma, because test results from samples that do not contain any or sufficient foetal DNA or are contaminated with maternal cellular DNA can be misleading. The analogous issue arises in diagnostic, prognostic or predicative tests of tumour derived cfDNA from the circulatory system: the quality of the test result often is dependent on the presence of sufficient, or sufficiently pure, tumour-derived cfDNA in the total DNA from the sample. The quantitative determination of an amount of DNA originating from such a cell type may, in itself, form a critical part of a diagnostic, prognostic or predicative test. For example, even though studies have demonstrated that the amount of foetal cfDNA released in maternal circulation increases with pregnancy progression (Lo et al 1998, Am J Hum Genet 62:768), preeclampsia, which results from abnormal trophoblast invasion, is also associated with further elevated foetal cfDNA levels in the maternal circulation. Lo et al (1999, Clin Chem 45:184) demonstrated a fivefold increase in circulating foetal DNA concentrations in the plasma of symptomatic preeclamptic women compared with control pregnant subjects, and further studies have investigated if elevated serum foetal cfDNA developed into early-onset preeclampsia (Yu et al 2013, Int J Mol Sci 14:7571), and the potential of cfDNA as a marker for preeclampsia is being increasingly studied (for review, see Hahn et al 2011, Placenta 32(Supl):S17). An increased level of circulating cfDNA and/or the level of methylation of such DNA at certain regions is also associated with other medical conditions. For example, hypermethylation of serum cfDNA was found to be common in patients suffering from oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and diagnostic accuracy was increased when methylation of multiple genes (RAR-beta, DAPK, CDH1, p16 and RASSF1A) were analysed in combination (Li et al 2011, Epigenetics 6:307). Elevated levels of circulating cfDNA have been reported in patients with acute dengue virus infection (Ha et al 2011, PLoS One 6(10):e25969), in acute Puumala hantavirus infection Outinen et al 2012, PLoS One 7(2):e31455) and high cfDNA has been reported to predict fatal outcome among Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia patients with intensive care unit treatment (Forsblom et al 2014, PLoS One 10;9(2):e87741). It is known that foetal cfDNA present in the maternal circulatory system and tumour derived circulating cfDNA is degraded. For example, studies characterising cfDNA in maternal plasma have found that the size of foetal DNA fragments were estimated to be <0.3kb, whereas that of maternal DNA was >1kb (Chan et al 2004, Clin Chem 50:88). Follow-up studies have demonstrated that the release of foetal DNA is due to the apoptosis of no more than three nucleosomal complexes, it has also been shown that the average foetal fragment size is 286 +/- 28 bp with a maximum foetal cfDNA fragment size ranging from 219 to 313 bp (Kimura et al 2011, Nagoya J Med Sci 73:129), and another study has reported that the most significant difference in the size distribution between foetal and total DNA is that foetal DNA exhibits a reduction in a 166-bp peak size and a relative prominence of the 143-bp peak; the latter likely corresponding to the trimming of a ∼20-bp linker fragment from a nucleosome to its core particle of ∼146 bp (Lo et al 2010, Sci Transl Med 2:61). In cancer patients, circulating cfDNA in plasma is protein-bound (nucleosomal) DNA and has a short half-life (10 to 15 min) which is removed mainly by the liver (Elshimali et al 2013, Int J Mol Sci 14:18925). Accumulation of cfDNA in the circulation of cancer patients can result from an excessive release of DNA caused by massive cell death, inefficient removal of the dead cells, or a combination of both (Zeerleder 2006, Crit Care 10:142). It should be noted that although cancer patients requiring renal support have higher values of circulating cfDNA, the renal elimination is not the main mechanism of its clearance. The plasma levels of circulating cfDNA do not seem to be dramatically altered in chronic kidney disease, peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis (Kirsch et al 2008, Ann NY Acad Sci 1137:135). Although the nucleosome is a very stable protein-DNA complex, it is not static and has been shown to undergo a number of different structural re-arrangements including nucleosome sliding and DNA site exposure. Depending on the context, nucleosomes can inhibit or facilitate transcription factor binding. Also, packaging of DNA into nucleosomes varies depending on the cell cycle stage and by local DNA region (Russell 2010, 'iGenetics". 3rd ed. San Francisco: Pearson Benjamin Cummings, pp 24-27). The degree to which chromatin is condensed is associated with a certain transcriptional state. Unpackaged or loose chromatin is more transcriptionally active than tightly packaged chromatin because it is more accessible to transcriptional machinery. By remodeling chromatin structure and changing the density of DNA packaging, gene expression can thus be modulated. Accordingly, and without being bound by theory, the qualitative and/or quantitative level of chromatin packing of a given region of cfDNA may affect its stability, and hence the amount detected in the circulatory system at any given time, Correspondingly, differences between the level of chromatin packing between different DNA regions (for example, due to differences in each regions state of transcription) may influence the relative quantities of DNA from each of these regions when detected as cfDNA, particularly as two studies have investigated in more detail the kinetics of, and reported the rapid, clearance of cfDNA from the circulatory system (Gauthier et al 1996, J Immunol 156:1151; Lo et al 1999, Am J Hum Genet 64:218). Various prior art methods have been described to detect, and quantify, cfDNA from a specific cell type. Quantitative analysis of aberrant p16 methylation was described using probe-based real-time quantitative PCR (Lo et al 1999, Cancer res 59:3899). Analogously, differences in the methylation of the placental mapsin gene found in material plasma has been described, and the methylation signature further analysed using MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry (Chim et al 2005). Total cfDNA and that from male foetuses (only) were accurately and robustly quantified in materal plasma from 5 to 41 weeks of gestation using a Y-chromosome specific marker (SRY) (Birch et al 2005, Clin Chem 51:2). Hypermethylation of RASSF1A has been proposed as a universal foetal DNA marker to improve the reliability of NIPT, and was studied in a duplex probe-based real-time PCR reaction compared to the non-differentially methylated region on the beta-actin gene (Chan et al 2006, Clin Chem 52:12). A complex method of quantification has been described (Nygren et al 2010; Clin Chem 56:10; WO 2010/033639; WO 2011/034631): starting from a 13-plex competition-PCR reaction (5 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) including TBX3, 3 regions on different genes for total DNA quantification, 3 for quantification of chromosome Y and 2 for restriction enzyme controls), such a complex reaction is subsequently processed for singe-base extension reactions and finally mass-spectrometry is subsequently conducted to both quantify and identify each of the single alleles my mass differences. Also using a complex process starting from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation, and based on SYBR green based quantitative PCR of a plurality of DMRs, has been claimed to be able to accurately quantitate foetal cfDNA and use such quantitation from eg chromosome 21 DMRs, to prenatally diagnose trisomies (Papageorgiou et al 2011, Nat Med 4:510; WO 2012/092592); although technical concerns about such an approach to diagnose trisomies have been raised (Tong et al 2012; Nat Med 18:1327). High-throughout droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has been described for absolute quantification of DNA copy number from normal and tumorous breast tissues, and also total and foetal cfDNA in maternal plasma using duplex probe-based quantitative PCR of RASSF1/RNaseP and RASSF1/beta-actin (Hindson et al 2011, Anal Chem 83:8604). Separate SYBR green quantitative PCR reactions of RASSF1A, SRY and DYS14 have been evaluated as an assay to detect RASSf1A to facilitate improved diagnostic reliability of NIPT (White et al 2012; PLOS ONE 7(9):e45073) . However, generally considered as the "gold standard" for the quantitative measurement of foetal cfDNA against which other assays are often compared, remains the quantification of Y chromosome-specific genes (eg SFY) of male foetuses eg, as used by Yu and co-workers to determine whether the increased foetal cfDNA in maternal serum level of gravitas developed into early-onset preeclampsia (Yu et al 2013, Int J Mol Sci 14:7571). Accordingly there is a need, from one or more of the above or perspectives, for improved methods to detect, preferably quantitatively, an amount of a species of DNA that originates from a particular cell type, such as a tumour-, foetal- or a placental cell, in particular to so detect cfDNA eg from the circulatory system of an individual. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide alternative, improved, simpler, cheaper and/or integrated means or methods that address one or more of these or other problems. Such an object underlying the present invention is solved by the subject matter as disclosed or defined anywhere herein, for example by the subject matter of the attached claims. Generally, and by way of brief description, the main aspects of the present invention can be described as follows: In a first aspect, and as may be further described, defined, claimed or otherwise disclosed herein, the invention relates to a method for detecting in a sample from an individual an amount of a species of DNA originating from cells of a given type, which sample comprises said species of DNA in admixture with differently methylated DNA not originating from cells of said type; said method comprising the steps: (a) treating the DNA present in said sample with a reagent that differentially modifies methylated and non-methylated DNA;(b) detecting in said sample the presence of methylation in said species of DNA at one or more differentially methylated region(s) (DMR(s)) that is(are) differently methylated between said species of DNA and the DNA not originating from cells of said type, the modification of DNA of such DMR by said reagent is sensitive to methylation of DNA, wherein the presence of methylated DNA at said DMR indicates the presence of said amount of species of DNA in said sample and the absence of methylated DNA at said DMR indicates the absence of said species of DNA in said sample; and(c) detecting an amount of total DNA present in said sample using at least one other region that is not differently methylated between said species of DNA and the DNA not originating from cells of said type, the modification of which regions(s) by said reagent is insensitive to methylation of DNA,wherein, said other region is located between about 20bp and about 20kb upstream or downstream of said DMR.

The present invention, and particular non-limiting aspects and/or embodiments thereof, can be described in more detail as follows: In a first aspect, the invention relates to a method for detecting in a sample from an individual an amount of a species of DNA originating from cells of a given type, which sample comprises said species of DNA in admixture with differently methylated DNA not originating from cells of said type; said method comprising the steps: (a) treating the DNA present in said sample with a reagent that differentially modifies methylated and non-methylated DNA;(b) detecting in said sample the presence of methylation in said species of DNA at one or more differentially methylated region(s) (DMR(s)) that is(are) differently methylated between said species of DNA and the DNA not originating from cells of said type, the modification of DNA of such DMR by said reagent is sensitive to methylation of DNA, wherein the presence of methylated DNA at said DMR indicates the presence of said amount of species of DNA in said sample and the absence of methylated DNA at said DMR indicates the absence of said species of DNA in said sample; and(c) detecting an amount of total DNA present in said sample using at least one other region that is not differently methylated between said species of DNA and the DNA not originating from cells of said type, the modification of which regions(s) by said reagent is insensitive to methylation of DNA,wherein, said other region is located between about 20bp and about 20kb upstream or downstream of said DMR. Terms as set forth herein are generally to be understood by their common meaning unless indicated otherwise. Where the term "comprising" or "comprising of" is used herein, it does not exclude other elements. For the purposes of the present invention, the term "consisting of" is considered to be a particular embodiment of the term "comprising of". If hereinafter a group is defined to comprise at least a certain number of embodiments, this is also to be understood to disclose a group that consists of all and/or only of these embodiments. Where used herein, "and/or" is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of the two specified features or components with or without the other. For example "A and/or B" is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of (i) A, (ii) B and (iii) A and B, just as if each is set out individually herein. In the context of the present invention, the terms "about" and "approximately" denote an interval of accuracy that the person skilled in the art will understand to still ensure the technical effect of the feature in question. The term typically indicates deviation from the indicated numerical value by ±20%, ±15%, ±10%, and for example ±5%. As will be appreciated by the person of ordinary skill, the specific such deviation for a numerical value for a given technical effect will depend on the nature of the technical effect. For example, a natural or biological technical effect may generally have a larger such deviation than one for a man-made or engineering technical effect. Where an indefinite or definite article is used when referring to a singular noun, e.g. "a", "an" or "the", this includes a plural of that noun unless something else is specifically stated. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the individual is a human or a non-human animal, where such non-human animal may, in particular embodiments, be selected from the group consisting of: horse, sheep, cow, pig, chicken, mouse and rat. In a more specific embodiment, the individual is a pregnant female human or a human individual suspected of being at increased risk of developing or suffering (or suffering from) a medical condition, such as one or more of the medical conditions disclosed herein. Such a method of the present invention is not intended to be practiced on the human or animal body; for example it is intended to be practiced in an in-vitro manner. In all aspects of the invention, the cell(s) of a given type may be a cell of a particular organ or tissues of the same individual. For example, the cell may be a tumour cell of the individual. Alternatively, such cell(s) may originate from a different individual or organism. For example, in the case of an individual being a pregnant female, the cell of a given type may be a cell of the foetus, including of the placenta of such foetus, and in other embodiments, the cell type may be an infectious agents such as a bacteria or a protozoa. In certain embodiments of the present invention, said species of DNA and/or said differently methylated DNA is cell-free DNA, and in particular of such embodiments is circulating cell-free DNA. In one particular embodiment, said species of DNA and the differently methylated DNA that is admixed therewith are both circulating cell-free DNA. The term "cell-free DNA" (or "cfDNA") is art recognised, and includes the meaning of DNA that is found outside of a cell, such as in a biological fluid (eg blood, or a blood fraction) of an individual. "Circulating" is also an art-recognised term, and includes the meaning that an entity or substance (eg cfDNA) is present in, detected or identified in, or isolated from, a circulatory system of the individual, such as the blood system or the lymphatic system. In particular, when cfDNA is "circulating" it is not located in a cell, and hence may be present in the plasma or serum of blood, or it may be present in the lymph of lymphatic fluid. The term differentially methylated region" or "DMR" will be recognised by the person of ordinary skill in the art, and is also intended to refer to a region in chromosomal DNA that is differentially methylated (eg at a CpG motif) between said species of DNA and the other DNA with which it is admixed in the sample. For example in one embodiment, the DMRs used in the present invention are differentially methylated between foetal and maternal DNA, or are differentially methylated between tumour-derived and non-tumour-derived DNA from the same individual. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the DMRs are hypermethlyated in foetal DNA and hypo methylated in maternal DNA, or are hypermethylated in tumour-derived DNA and hypomethylated in DNA that is derived from non-tumour tissue of the individual. That is, in such regions exhibit a greater degree (ie more) methylation in said species of DNA (eg the foetal or tumour cfDNA) as compared to the other DNA (eg matermal or non-tumour DNA), such as about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100% of, or more of, the sites available for methylation at a given DMR are methylated in said species of DNA as compared to the same sites in the other DNA. A reagent is used in the present invention that differentially (eg selectively) modifies methylated as compared to non-methylated DNA. For example, treatment of DNA with a reagent comprising bisulphite (bisulfite) converts cytosine residues to uracil, but leaves 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected. Thus, bisulphite treatment introduces specific changes in the DNA sequence that depend on the methylation status of individual cytosine residues, yielding single- nucleotide resolution information about the methylation status of a segment of DNA. Various analyses can be performed on the altered sequence to retrieve this information, including the use of PCR primers and/or probes that can distinguish between such singe-nucleotide changes. Such a reagent may alternatively (or in addition) comprise a restriction enzyme that is sensitive to the DNA methylation states. Cleavage of such a restriction enzyme's recognition sequence may be blocked, or impaired, when a particular base in the enzyme's recognition site is modified, eg methylated. In particular embodiments of all aspects of the invention, the reagent comprises a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, such as a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme disclosed herein; including such embodiments that comprise two, three, four, five or more of such methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Prior to step (a), the sample may be processed to isolate, enrich and/or purify, the DNA present therein. For example, a plasma sample may be processed using a cfDNA isolation process or kit to provide a (non-natural) subsequent solution that comprises an admixture of said species of DNA together with the differentially methylated DNA that does not originate from the cell-type. The step of treating in (a) may comprise the step of adding a separate solution that comprises said reagent (eg a methylation sensitive restriction enzyme) to the admixed DNA of the sample (eg, to a non-natural solution comprising such admixed DNA); and/or may comprise maintaining (or changing to) certain conditions. In particular, when said reagent comprises one or more methylation sensitive restriction enzyme, the step of treating in (a) may comprise incubating the DNA and the enzyme(s) together at about 37oC for between about 5min and 300min, such as between about 30min and 90min or about 60min, and optionally may comprise a step of incubating such mixture at a higher temperature (for example, between about 50oC and 90oCm such as about 80oC) so as to deactivate the enzyme(s). In certain embodiments, the composition formed for a treating step of (a) may be non-naturally occurring. For example, particular salts of components of the solution (or buffer); and/or the mixture of (eg human) cfDNA together with one or more bacterial-derived restriction enzymes (or a non-natural mutant thereof) may be a non-natural composition or mixture. In contrast, an "other region" ("OR") used in the present invention is not (significantly) differentially methylated between said species of DNA and other DNA with which it is admixed in the sample. For example, under the conditions and nature of the reagent used, there is no detectable difference between modification by such reagent at the other region of said species of DNA (eg foetal DNA) as compared to the other region of the admixed DNA (eg the maternal DNA). Such a non-difference may be achieved if the other region comprises no sites for methylation, if there is no difference in the degree of methylation if such sites are present, or by the use of a reagent that does not recognise any sites of methylation present in the other region. The other region used in the present invention (that is not so differentially methylated) should be non-overlapping with the DMR used in the present invention. For example, the other region can be located further than about 10bp, 20bp, 50bp, or more than 100bp, 500bp, 1kb or 10kp, away from the DMR, such as is located between about 20bp and about 20kb upstream or downstream of (including embodiments being located within the same gene as) said DMR. In particular, the genomic location of the other region used in the present invention is generally located in the same portion of the genome, such as between about 20bp and about 20kb upstream or downstream of (including embodiments being located within the same gene as) the genomic location of at least one of the DMRs used herein. The inventors find that detection (and particularly quantification) of the species of DNA is enhanced (eg, in terms of sensitivity, accuracy and/or precision) if the other region is so located in the same portion of the genome as one of the DMRs. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that with such similarly-located DMR(s) and other region, the effect of variation in chromatin/nucleosome packing across the genome - and hence stability/degradation of different regions of genomic DNA - is mitigated, such that any difference in stability/degradation of a DMR (ie detecting the species of DNA) as compared to the other region (is detecting total DNA) is less, and hence a relative (and absolute) quantification may be made without it being (significantly) confounded by quantitative differences brought about by (significantly) differential chromatin/nucleosome packing across the genome between a DMR and an other region. In one embodiment of the present invention, the detection of the various DNA regions, ie the DMR(s) and the other region(s), may occur in a simplified process. For example, using a single aliquot of DNA from the sample, such DNA regions may be detected in a single vessel. This feature may simplify the method, and can provide for more efficient and accurate detection (especially in those embodiments when detection is quantitative). The term "vessel" will be art recognised, and includes embodiments of a vessel (such as a tube, well of a microtitre plate, nano-well, capillary reaction vessel etc) in which a process or procedure comprised in the method occurs, such as a reaction and/or detection process or a step of a method of the present invention. Other such vessels may include droplets in oil/water emulsions, nanoparticles or a hybridisation chamber; as appropriate to the detection technology used. The detectable labels used, in certain embodiments may be the same for each DMR and/or may be the same for each other region, provided that, when detected essentially simultaneously, the label(s) used for the other region(s) is different (ie, can be separately detected) to the label(s) used for the DMR(s). Detectable labels that are "the same", can also include labels while structurally different, are functionally (essentially) similar as they cannot be significantly differentiated by the detection technology employed. For example, structurally different fluorescent dyes may be considered "the same" if their excitation and emission spectra are (substantially or essentially) similar, or overlap to such a degree that they are able to be excited and detected simultaneously with the same wavelength(s). Suitable labels (and detection modalities) are further described elsewhere herein. Optionally, the detection of the DMR(s) and other region(s) may be made effectively simultaneously. For example, within the same (reaction/detection) vessel, all such regions (and hence said species of DNA and total DNA) can be detected within less than about 5s, 1s, 0.5s, 100ms, 10ms, 1ms, 100us, 10us or 1us of each other, and for example without transferring the vessel, or the reaction/mixture, to any subsequent vessel, assay or equipment, or for example, without adapting or recalibrating the detection process for the DMR(s) or the other region(s) separately. The use of two different detectable label(s) - one for said DMR(s) and one for the other region(s) - utilises components, process and/or steps that are non-natural. For example, a composition of two specific labels together with the specific DNA regions would (generally) not be found in nature. In particular, short probes used in quantitative probe-based PCR, while may comprise a DNA sequence that is a fragment of that found in a natural genome, when linked to a one or more labels (such as a fluorescent dye) form a specific labelled fragment that is non-natural. Collectively, the features of the present invention provide for certain advantages over prior art methods. These can include sensitive detection of methylation (and hence the species of DNA to be detected) and/or accurate and/or improved precision quantification of the amount of said species of DNA by reference to the amount of total DNA detected using a co-located other region, and optionally within the same assay, from the same aliquot of admixed DNA and effectively simultaneously with the detection of the two or more DMRs. By way of graphical description, a schematic representation of the general arrangement of the DMR(s), the other region(s) and the detectable label(s), as used for the present invention, is presented in FIGURE 1. (1) The presence of methylation in DNA at DMR1 is detected in the context of an other region ("OR1") is located within the same portion of the genome (eg, between about 20bp and about 20kb upstream or downstream of) DMR1. (2) Optionally, additional DMRs and/or ORs (such as DMR2 and/or OR2, and up to DMRn and ORn) may be detected, and pairs of such additional DMRs and ORs may each be co-located in the same portion of the genome (eg, between about 20bp and about 20kb upstream or downstream of) as each other. Optionally, (3) the presence of methylation in DNA is detected at multiple DMRs, using the same detectable lable(s) and/or (4) the amount of total DNA detected using at least one OR (OR1, and optionally, OR2 or up to ORn) is detected using different detectable label(s) to those used to detect methylation at the DMR(s) (optionally, the detectable label(s) used is the same for all the ORs). In particular embodiments, said detection in step (b) comprises the use of two or more of said DMRs, and such two or more DMRs may be detected in such step using the same detectable label(s) for each of said DMRs. The combination of a feature of the present invention (similarly-located DMR(s) and other region(s)) with one of more other feature of the present invention: eg the use of at least two DMRs, and/or the detection in step (b) and the detection in step (c) are made using the same aliquot of DNA of the sample, and in the same reaction/detection vessel, and effectively simultaneously for such DMRs and other region, and/or using: (x) the same detectable labels(s) for each of said DMRs; and/or (y) a different detectable label for said other region(s); is each a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The use of such a combination of features in the present invention provides opportunity for efficiency improvements and/or synergistic enchantment of outcome. For example, an improved sensitivity and/or accuracy and/or precision of detection (eg, detection of a quantitative amount) or said species of DNA can be obtained by the use of such a combination; the degree of improvement of which can be synergistic, as compared to the use of each feature alone; eg the enhancement obtained by use of the combined features being greater than the sum of each enhancement obtained by the use of each feature individually. In certain embodiments, prior to or as part of the detection that occurs as part of a step (b) and/or a step (c) of any method of present invention, each DNA region comprising said DMR(s) and/or said other region(s), respectively, is(are) amplified. Amplification of DNA may be conducted using any suitable replication process, and in particular of such embodiments, each of the DMR(s) and/or other region(s), is amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers suitably designed for each DMR and/or other region. The person of ordinary skill will readily be able to design such PCR primers for use in the method of the invention, for example by use of primer design algorithms and programs such as Clone Manager Professional 9 (Sci-Ed Software), Vector NTI (Life Technologies), or web-based tools such as those found from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/ or molbiol-tools.ca/PCR.htm. Those embodiments of the present invention that comprise PCR amplification can further comprises specific steps that are related to the practice of PCR, such as any of those described herein, or in particular the steps of: (A) providing a reaction mixture comprising a double-stranded target DNA, a pair of primers (for example, a pair of primers disclosed herein) designed to amplify a region of such DNA (such as a DMR or an other region as described herein) wherein the first primer is complementary to a sequence on the first strand of the target DNA and the second primer is complementary to a sequence on the second strand of the target DNA, Taq polymerase, and a plurality of free nucleotides comprising adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine; (B) heating the reaction mixture to a first predetermined temperature for a first predetermined time to separate the strands of the target DNA from each other; (C) cooling the reaction mixture to a second predetermined temperature for a second predetermined time under conditions to allow the first and second primers to hybridise with their complementary sequences on the first and second strands of the target DNA, and to allow the Taq polymerase to extend the primers; and (D) repeating steps (B) and (C) at least 20 times. In other embodiments, a detectable label used in step (b) and/or step (c) of a method of the invention is independently selected from the group consisting of: fluorescent, protein, small molecule or radioactive label. For example, fluorescent labels that are the same (including, by having similar or overlapping excitation and/or emission spectra) may be used for the DMR(s), and a fluorescent label that has an excitation and/or emission spectra (in particular, a different emission spectrum) may be used for detection of the other region(s). The person of ordinary skill will be able to select appropriate such fluorescent label(s) for use in the present invention from, for example, the group consisting of: FAM, TET, JOE, VIC, HEX, NED, PET, ROX, TAMRA, Quasar and Texas Red. In other embodiments, a detectable label may be a protein or small molecule tag that, for example, can be detected using a specific antibody and ELISA-type detection approaches. The use of the same protein or small molecule for each of the DMR(s), and a detectably different protein or small molecule for the other region(s), may also be utilised for the detectable label(s) used in the present invention. Different radioactive labels may be distinguished by their emission energy, penetration/excitation characteristics and particle-type (for example, by distinguishing between alpha and beta particles). Other detectable labels (such as nucleic-acid coded tag) may also be employed in the present invention. In particular embodiments, the detection in step (b) of a method of the example comprises real-time quantitative probe-based PCR, eg by using at least one labelled probe which is specific for one of the DMR(s). In those embodiments where PCR amplification of multiple DMRs is made in the same reaction, such PCR can be considered as "multiplex" (or "duplex" if only two DMRs are so amplified). Likewise, the detection in step (c) in the methods of the invention may, in addition or alternatively, comprise real-time quantitative probe-based PCR, such as by using at least one labelled probe specific for one of said other region(s). The term "probe-based" quantitative PCR is art recognised, and encompasses various embodiments described and marketed under different brand names (such as "TaqMan" PCR of Roche), and uses a (eg fluorescent) reporter probe that is specific for the detection of a given amplicon (eg a DMR or an other region). Probe-based quantitative PCR is distinct from quantitative PCR using double-stranded DNA-binding dyes (eg SYBR Green) as reporters, as such double-stranded DNA-binding dyes bind non-specially to any double-stranded amplicon and eg cannot be used to distinguish between detection of the DMR(s) (ie said species of DNA) from detection of the other region(s) (ie detection of total DNA). As the person of ordinary skill will appreciate, a specific amplicon of PCR may be detected using a single probe or by using multiple probes (such as two or three probes) for an amplicon. Such probe-based quantitative PCR may be conducted in an analogue-approach, using a machine such as a LightCycler in which the intensity of signal (eg over time) is measured and used to quantitatively determine detection. Alternatively, digital PCR (dPCR), ie, PCR conducted in multiple events so as to determine the number of amplification events as method to quantitate an amount of detected DNA. For example, dPCR that is conducted in nano-wells or droplets (ddPCR). The person of ordinary skill will be able to design suitable primers and probes (and with suitable labels, eg dyes) for probe-based quantitative PCR detection of the DMRs and/or other regions(s); for example by using primer/probe design software as described elsewhere herein. As will be known, the PCR primers may overlap methylation site(s) specific for the methylation-specific modifying reagent used in the methods, in particular when the reagent comprises one or more methylation sensitive restriction enzyme, such as one (or a combination thereof) as disclosed herein. In particular such embodiments, one or other (or when considered together, both) of the PCR primers for a given DMR may overlap two or three such methylation sites (such as two or three restriction sites for methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, each of which may comprise, or comprises, a methylation site). Alternatively or in addition, the primers for a DMR may be designed to flank one, two, three or more such methylation sites, such as up to 10, 15, 20, 25 or 50 such methylation sites, in particular flanking restriction sites for one, two, three or more such methylation sites, such as up to 10, 15, 20, 25 or 50 methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, each of which may comprise, or comprises, a methylation site. The present invention includes the use of one other region to provide for the detection of an amount of total DNA in the admixture. However, the present invention also encompasses embodiments that use more than one other region. For example, the invention includes such embodiments wherein said detection in step (c) comprises using at least two of said other regions, such as two, three or four of said other regions. In particular embodiments of all aspects of the present invention, the number of said other regions is the same as the number of DMRs used in step (b). For example, if two DMRs are used then two other regions are used in such an embodiment, and if three DMRs are used then three other regions are used (such as depicted in FIGURE 1). As described elsewhere herein, the present invention includes where the other region is generally located in the same portion of the genome, such as between about 20bp and about 20kb upstream or downstream of (including embodiments within the same gene as) the genomic location of at least one of the DMRs used herein. Accordingly, if multiple other regions are used in the present invention, then embodiments are included where two or more of such other regions are similarly located in the genome to the two or more DMRs. For example, one of said other regions may be located between about 20bp and about 20kb upstream or downstream of (including embodiments within the same gene as) a DMR used in step (b) and each other of the said other regions (eg, a second other region) is located between about 20bp and about 20kb upstream or downstream of (including embodiments within the same gene as) another of said (eg, non-overlapping) DMRs (eg, the second DMR). In certain embodiments an additional other region, may overlap with a DMR. An other region used in the present invention, when generally located in the same portion of the genome as a DMR, may be located upstream or downstream of one of said DMRs within a distance selected from the group consisting of: between about 16kb to 20bp, 14kb to 20bp, 12kb to 20bp, 10kb to 20bp, 8kb to 20bp, 6kb to 20bp, 5kb to 20bp, 4kb to 20bp, 3kb to 2bp, 16kb to 20bp, 1kb to 20bp, 500bp to 20bp, 200bp to 20bp, 20kb to 15kb, 15kb to 10kb, 12kb to 8kb, 10kb to 8kb, 11kb to 7kb, 11kb to 10kb, 9kb to 8kb, 8kb to 6kb, 6kb to 4kb, 4kb to 2kb, 2kb to 500bp, 1kb to 100bp, 500bp to 50bp, 400bp to 200bp and 500bp to 100bp. In particular embodiments, each other region used in the present invention is so generally located to a different of the DMRs used. If multiple other regions are used, then the present invention includes embodiments where the detection in step (c) is made using the same detectable label for each of said other regions and/or comprises multiplex real-time quantitative PCR using at least two labelled probes each of which is specific for one of said other regions. In particular embodiments, all detection steps (ie, those required for all DMR(s) and all other region(s)) are conducted in an efficient and effective manner using multiplex quantitative probe-based (eg TaqMan) PCR, in one process step or reaction. For example, the detection in step (c) and said detection in step (b) are made using the same aliquot of DNA of said sample, and in the same reaction/detection vessel, and effectively simultaneously with each other, and by multiplex real-time quantitative PCR using at least one labeled probe specific for each of the said DMRs and other region(s). In particular of such embodiments, the reagent comprises one or more methylation sensitive restriction enzyme, such as one (or a combination thereof) as disclosed herein. The present invention may also include further procedures, such as one or more control procedures. For example, the present invention can include one or more steps directed to the detection of a third class of DNA region that acts as a control for the modification step (eg, as a control for restriction enzyme digestion). Such embodiments may, for example, also be conducted using multiplex real-time quantitative probe-based PCR wherein such control region is amplified and detected by a third set of primer/probe(s) with a third detectable label used for such class of region. In one embodiment of the present invention of particular relevance, said species of DNA originates from cells of a foetus and/or the placenta of a foetus and said sample is from a pregnant female. In such embodiments, the sample may be obtained in a non-invasive manner. For example, said species of DNA is circulating cell-free DNA that has been detected from the sample being blood or a blood fraction (such as plasma or serum) that has been obtained from the pregnant female by conventional means such as a blood collection tube. The present invention includes embodiments where the DMR(s) is(are) hypermethlyated in foetal DNA and hypo methylated in maternal DNA. In certain embodiments, such a DMR may be located in a promoter, enhancer region or an exon of a gene, such as a gene disclosed herein. Alternatively, a DMR may be located in an intron of such a gene, or in a non-coding region of the genome. In particular embodiments of all aspects of the present invention, such genome and/or gene is a human genome or gene. Specifically included in the present invention are embodiments wherein said DMR(s) comprises at least one, preferably at least two, methylation site(s) specific for said reagent, and at least one of said DMR(s) is located in a portion of the genome and/or gene (eg a human genome or gene) that is RASSF1A and/or TBX3, or selected from the group consisting of: RASSF1A, TBX3, HLCS, ZFY, CDC42EP1, MGC15523, SOX14 and SPN. Also, embodiments are included wherein said DMR(s) comprises at least one, preferably at least two, methylation site(s) specific for said reagent, and at least one of said DMR(s) is located in a region and/or gene selected from the group consisting of: AIRE, SIM2, ERG, VAPA-APCDDI, one disclosed in WO 2011/034631 as being hypermethylated in foetal DNA relative to maternal DNA (eg, SEQ ID NOs: 1-59, 90-163, 176, 179, 180, 184, 188, 189, 190, 191, 193, 195, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 221, 223, 225, 226, 231, 232, 233, 235, 239, 241, 257, 258, 259, and/or 261 of WO 2011/034631) and one disclosed in WO 2011/092592 (eg, EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, EP5, EP6, EP7, EP8, EP9, EP10, EP11 and/or EP12 of WO 2011/092592, as further investigated in Lim et al 2014, BMC Medical Genomics 7:1). If two DMRs are used, then in particular embodiments of all aspects of the present invention, they are not located in the same portion of the genomic and/or gene. For example, such DMRs may be located on separate chromosomes, or separated by more than about 20kb, or more than about 15kb, 10kb, 8kb, 6kb, 4kb, 2kb, 1kb, 500bp or 200bp. Alternatively, it is envisioned, that when two (or more) DMRs are used in the present invention, they may, in certain embodiments, be located in the same region or gene (such as one described herein) and, further, may overlap with each other. In particular embodiments of the present invention, when two of said DMRs are used (or more than two DMRs are being used) each is located in a portion of the genome and/or gene (preferably that is human) that is RASSF1A and/or TBX3, or is selected from the group consisting of: RASSF1A, TBX3, HLCS, ZFY, CDC42EP1, MGC15523, SOX14 and SPN; and/or at least one of said DMRs is located between about positions 4,700bp and 5,600bp of RASSF1A (NCBI Reference Sequence: NG_023270.1: Homo sapiens Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family member 1 (RASSF1), RefSeqGene on chromosome 3; SEQ ID NO.: 13) or about positions 1,660bp and 2,400bp of TBX3 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NG_008315.1: Homo sapiens T-box 3 (TBX3), RefSeqGene on chromosome 12; SEQ ID NO.: 14). In a more particular embodiment, two (or more) DMRs are used, and a first DMR comprises one located between about positions 4,700bp and 5,600bp of RASSF1A and a second DMR comprises one located between about positions 1,660bp and 2,400bp of TBX3. In particular embodiments, a DMR is located in RASSF1A between about positions 4,900bp and 5,500bp, 5,000bp and 5,400bp, or 5,100bp and 5,300bp of RASSF1A; and/or is located in TBX3 between about positions 1,800bp and 2,260bp, 1,920bp and 2,160bp or 1,920bp and 2,080bp of TBX3. The general arrangement of the DMRs and other regions ("OR") used in one embodiment of the present invention, is graphically represented by FIGURE 2: (1a) DMR1 is found in exon 2 of RASSF1A and OR1 is located within exon 4 of RASSF1A, with DMR1 located between positions 50,340,672bp and 50,340,784bp and OR1 located between positions 50,331,604bp and 50,331,702bp of the RASS1A genomic sequence (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_000003.12 Homo sapiens chromosome 3, GRCh38 Primary Assembly), separating DMR1 and OR1 by a distance of 8,969bp. (1b) DMR2 is found in the promoter region of TBX3, with DMR2 located between positions 114,687,095bp and 114,687,189bp and OR2 is located between positions 114,676,384bp and 114,676,454bp of the TBX3 genomic sequence (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_000012.12 Homo sapiens chromosome 12, GRCh38 Primary Assembly), separating DMR2 and OR2 by a distance of 10,640bp. (2) Methylation in DNA at the two DMRs is detected using probe-based quantitative PCR using the respective forward (F) and reverse (R) PCR primers and region-specific probes, each probe labelled with the same labels (P*). (3) Total DNA is detected at two ORs using probe-based quantitative PCR using the respective forward (F) and reverse (R) PCR primers and region-specific probes, each probe labelled with the same labels for the ORs that is different to the labels used for the two DMRs (P**). Details of primer and probe sequences and probe labels are set out in TABLE 1. The term "methylation site(s)" will be art-recognised, and has a meaning that encompasses, for example, a CpG motif within a short nucleotide sequence (eg one that is 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 bp in length) that is, preferably, recognised by a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, such as one disclosed elsewhere herein. Analogously, the other region, when located in particular portions and/or genes of the genome, may be located in a promoter, enhancer region or an exon of a gene, or alternatively, located in an intron of such a gene, or in a non-coding region of the genome. In particular embodiments of all aspects of the present invention, such genome and/or gene is a human genome or gene. In particular embodiments, when an other region used in the present invention is located in the same portion of the genome and/or gene that features one or more DMRs (preferably, non-overlapping with a DMR used in the invention), then it is located in a portion of the genome and/or gene such as a gene (eg human, and/or in particular when said species of DNA is foetal cfDNA) that is RASSF1A and/or TBX3, or is selected from the group consisting of: RASSF1A, TBX3, HLCS, ZFY, CDC42EP1, MGC15523, SOX14 and SPN. When not co-located with a DMR (for example, when a second or multiple other region is used), then such other region may, in certain embodiments, be located in a (eg human) housekeeping gene (such as GAPDH, beta-actin, ALB, APOE or RNASEP). In particular embodiments, said other region comprises a portion of the genome without a methylation site specific for said reagent, and said other region is located in the (eg human) genes RASSF1A or TBX3 (eg SEQ ID NOs,: 13 and 14 respectively), and includes more particular embodiments wherein two or more of said other regions are used in detection step (c) and the first other region is located between about positions 14,220bp and 13,350bp of such RASSF1A and the second other region is located between about positions 12,400bp and 13,000bp of such TBX3. In particular embodiments, an other region is located in RASSF1A between about positions 14,230bp and 14,340bp, 14,230bp and 14,330bp, 14,230bp and 14,320bp, or 14,230bp and 14,310bp of such RASSF1A; and/or is located in TBX3 between about positions 12,400bp and 12,940bp, 12,700bp and 12,850bp or 12,710bp and 12,790bp of such TBX3. Alternatively, an other region may be located in an exon such as between about positions 13,790bp and 13,880bp, or 14,490bp and 14,600bp of such RASSF1A, or between about positions 8,040bp and 8,180bp or 6,230bp and 6,350bpof such TBX3; or an other region may be located in an intron such as between about positions 10,500bp and 11,90bp of such RASSF1A, or between about positions 10,000bp and 11,000bp of such TBX3 There is now strong evidence that the level of foetal cfDNA (and/or total cfDNA) present in the circulatory system (eg in plasma) of a pregnant female is a marker of one or more forms of preeclampsia, such as early-onset preeclampsia, mild and/or severe preeclampsia (see Hahn et al 2011, Placenta 32(Supl):S17). The present invention shows particular utility in the efficient, effective, sensitive and/or low-variability detection/quantification of foetal cfDNA present in plasma of pregnant females, and the present invention has particular utility therein. Accordingly, in particular embodiments of the present invention, the individual is a pregnant female and is susceptible to suffering or developing a pregnancy-associated medical condition; particularly where said pregnancy-associated medical condition is preeclampsia. As used herein, an individual "susceptible to" a medical condition may alternatively be described as "is suspected to" or to "be considered at risk of being susceptible to" suffering or developing a medical condition; and in certain embodiments, the present invention is used to screen and/or diagnose the individual for susceptibility to, risk of suffering or developing, or suffering from or developing, a medical condition. In alternative embodiments, the individual is a pregnant female and is susceptible to (or considered at risk of being susceptible to) suffering or developing a pregnancy-associated medical condition selected from the group consisting of: preterm labour, intrauterine growth retardation and vanishing twin. In particular, the inventors were surprised that the sensitivity of the present invention was such that discrepancies between cfDNA levels determined by the method of the invention and that determined by counts of Y-chromosome sequences as determined by massively parallel sequencing approaches, was useful in identifying one or more cases of a vanishing twin in (mixed-sex) twin pregnancies that previously were believed to be singleton pregnancies, and/or to follow the relative development and health of one or other of such (mixed-sex) twin pregnancies. The present invention may also be utilised in gender determination of twin pregnancies, by consideration of the relative values for foetal cfDNA compared to counts of Y-chromosome sequences determined from cfDNA (eg by using parallel sequencing approaches). In these regards, it should be noted that approaches that use massively-parallel sequencing of random cfDNA in maternal blood typically always count a very low frequency of "Y-chomomosone" sequences (such as between about 0.003% and 0.004% of all sequences, or between about 0.0015% and 0.01% or 0.002% and 0.005% of all sequences) in all female pregnancies due to homology of certain Y-chromosome short sequences to other chromosomes. A cut off of "Y-chromosome" sequence counts of about 0.005%, or between about 0.003%, 0.004%, 0.006% or 0.007%, may therefore be employed for female samples. As described elsewhere herein, there is also increasing evidence that the presence and amount of methylated DNA at certain DMRs is indicative or prognostic of certain medical conditions that are not associated with pregnancy. Accordingly, in another particular embodiment of the present invention, said species of DNA originates from a cell type associated with such a medical condition, particularly in those embodiments where said species of DNA is circulating cell-free DNA and said sample is a blood fraction such as plasma or serum. For example, the medical condition may be a cell proliferative disorder, such as a tumour or cancer. In particular embodiments, the medical condition is a tumour or a cancer of an organ selected from the list consisting of: liver, lung, breast, colon, oesophagus, prostate, ovary, cervix, uterus, testis, brain, bone marrow and blood; and/or said species of DNA may originate from cells of a tumour; particularly where such tumour is a carcinoma or cancer of an organ selected from the group consisting of: liver, lung, breast, colon, oesophagus, prostate, ovary, cervix, uterus, testis, brain, bone marrow and blood. When used in the context of a medical condition being a tumour or cancer, the present invention includes embodiment wherein said DMR(s) comprises at least one, preferably at least two, methylation site(s) specific for said reagent, and at least one of said DMR is located in a portion of the genome and/or a gene (in particular, when such genome and/or gene is a human genome or gene) selected from the group consisting of: a tumour suppressor gene, p16, SEPT9, RASSF1A, GSTP1. DAPK, ESR1, APC, HSD17B4 and H1C1. In particular, one of said DMR(s) may be located in RASSF1A (eg SEQ ID NO. 13) such as located between about positions 4,700bp and 5,600bp of such RASSF1A; and/or said other region is located between about positions 14,220bp and 13,350bp of such RASSF1A. Other particular locations of the DMR(s) and/or other region(s) within RASSF1A for use in this embodiment are disclosed elsewhere herein. Furthermore, the person of ordinary skill will now recognise that other DMRs and/or other regions located in other portions of the genome of in other genes may be identified from the relevant scientific literature (eg, for review, see Elshimali 2013). In particular when used in the context of a medical condition being a tumour or cancer, the present invention includes embodiments where at least one or more additional other region(s) are located in a (eg human) housekeeping gene (such as GAPDH, beta-actin, ALB, APOE or RNASEP). Alternatively for such context, said additional other region(s) may be located in the same portion of the genome and/or gene that feature one or more DMRs (such as those p16, SEPT9, RASSF1A, GSTP1. DAPK, ESR1, APC, HSD17B4 and H1C1). In yet another particular embodiment of the present invention, said species of DNA originates from a cell type associated with a medical condition selected from the group consisting of: an infection/infectious disease, a wasting disorder, a degenerative disorder, an (auto)immune disorder, kidney disease, liver disease, inflammatory disease, acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, myocardial infarction, and a combination of any of the forgoing (such as sepsis) and/or with a cell proliferative disorder, particularly in those embodiments where said species of DNA is circulating cell-free DNA and said sample is a blood fraction such as plasma or serum. For example, the medical condition may be an infection/infectious disease, such as one caused by a bacterial, viral or protozoan pathogen, including a pathogen selected from the group consisting of: a retrovirus (such as HIV), a herpes virus (such as HSV, EBV, CMV, HHV or VSV), dengue virus, mycobacteria (eg Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and hantavirus. In certain embodiments, the medical condition is sepsis and/or excludes kidney disease. In all aspects of the present invention, there exist embodiments wherein the sample is a tissue sample or a sample of biological fluid. In particular, the sample is whole blood or a blood fraction (eg, such as plasma or serum). In alterative embodiments, the sample is biological fluid selected from the group consisting of: urine, saliva, sweat, ejaculate, tears, phlegm, vaginal secretion, vaginal wash and colonic wash. In more particular embodiments, the sample is a plasma or serum sample from the individual, or is urine from the individual. In other embodiments, the sample is largely (or essentially) free from cells, and/or is not a whole blood and/or ejaculate sample. In certain embodiments, the sample is not ejaculate if the individual is female and the sample is not a vaginal wash if the individual is male. In all aspects of the present invention, the reagent that differentially modifies methylated and non-methylated DNA may comprise bisulphite and/or an agent that selectively digests unmethylated over methylated DNA (for example, such agent may digest unmethylated DNA but not methylated DNA). In particular embodiments, the reagent agent comprises: at least one methylation sensitive enzyme; at least one methylation sensitive restriction enzyme; and/or an agent selected from the group consisting of: AatII, AciI, AclI, AfeI, AgeI, AgeI-HF, AscI, AsiSI, AvaI, BceAI, BmgBI, BsaAI, BsaHI, BsiEI. BsiWI, BsmBI, BspDI, BsrFI, BssHII, BstBI, BstUI, ClaI, EagI, FauI, FseI, FspI, HaeII, HgaI, HhaI, HinP1I, HpaII, Hpy99I, HpyCH4IV, KasI, MluI, NaeI, NarI, NgoMIV, NotI, NotI-HF, NruI, Nt.BsmAI, Nt.CviPII, PaeR7I, PluTI, PmlI, PvuI, PvuI-HF, RsrII, SacII, SalI, SalI-HF, SfoI, SgrAI, SmaI, SnaBI, TspMI and ZraI. In particular embodiments, said reagent is one selected from the group consisting of: BstUI, HhaI and HpaII. In related embodiments, the reagent may comprise two or more of any of the reagents disclosed herein. For example, it may comprise two, three, four, five or more (eg up to seven, eight or ten) methylation sensitive restriction enzymes, including a reagent comprising or essentially consisting of two or three of the methylation sensitive restriction enzymes selected from the group consisting of: BstUI, HhaI and HpaII The use of bisulphite or methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to study differential methylation will be well known to the person of ordinary skill, who may apply teachings of standard texts or adaptation of published methods such as Poon et al (2002), Nygren et al (2010) or Yegnasubramanian ; et al (2006, Nuc Acid Res 34:e19). By way of illustration, the inventors provide examples herein that employ the use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes as the reagent that differentially modifies methylated and non-methylated DNA. For further illustration using bisulphite as reagent, it will be apparent to the person of ordinary skill that bisulphite-modified DNA methylation sites may be detected using eg methylation-specific PCR (such as using primers and/or probes that selectively bind to the bisulphite-modified sequences) and/or by the subsequent use of restriction enzymes the recognition site of which is created upon such bisulphite-modification. In particular embodiments of all aspects of the invention, a quantitative amount of said species of DNA (and/or or said total DNA) is to be detected and/or determined. Accordingly in such embodiments, one or more (eg each) of said detection steps comprises quantitative detection and said detected amount of said species of DNA is expressed as a relative concentration of said species of DNA to the total DNA present in said sample. If an absolute amount of total DNA is known, then correspondingly an absolute amount (for example, as represented by a concentration such as ug/mL or genome-equivalents such as Eg/mL) of the species of DNA can be determined from such relative concentration. An absolute amount of total DNA for a sample may be determined, for certain embodiments, by including the further steps of: detecting an amount of total DNA in a standard sample of DNA of known amount using the same other regions(s) as used in step (c); and comparing the signal detected from said standard sample of DNA to the signal detected in step (c). Such a standard sample of DNA (of known amount/concentration) is readily available from commercial sources, and especially if prepared and analysed using a dilution series, can readily and efficiently be used to determine (by interpolation/estimation from the standard curve) an absolute amount of total DNA present in the sample. Practically, such standard curve may be prepared and analysed essentially as described for the other regions (but in a separate set of standard vessels/reactions), preferably in the same run as the detection of the DMRs/other region(s); and may even use the same reaction master-mix. Accordingly, while the "DMR(s)" of the DNA control may be detected for such standard DNA, such a signal is not required to generate a standard curve. Accordingly, if the signal from a such a standard DNA sample is used to compare, the in certain embodiments where each of said detection steps comprises quantitative detection, said detected amount of said species of DNA can be expressed as an absolute amount of said species of DNA in said sample. A determined quantitative amount of said species of DNA has utility in assessing the risk of the individual to certain medial conditions and/or if there is sufficient of such species of DNA in the sample to enable further analysis of such species of DNA to be conducted efficiently, accurately and/or in a cost effective manner. Accordingly, certain embodiments of the present invention further include the step of: comparing the amount of said species of DNA detected with a threshold amount and/or reference distribution of amounts, wherein an increase in the (or outlying) amount of said species of DNA indicates an increased risk of the individual suffering from or developing a medical condition. Threshold amounts and/or a set of amounts to form a reference distribution may be obtained from published literature and or empirical studies. For example, using published threshold values (Papantoniou et al 2013, Prenat Diag 33:682) if the total cfDNA exceeds an amount of about 7,500Eg/mL plasma or if the foetal cfDNA fraction exceeds an amount of about 500Eg/mL plasma, then the woman may be determined to have such an increased risk. Such a risk may instead or additional be assessed by considering: (i) the fold-increase (eg 1.5, 3, 3.5 or 4-fold increase) of foetal cfDNA (determined for such woman compared to a threshold amount), factoring into the determination that for later-term pregnancies a higher fold-increase in foetal cfDNA may be utilised (Zeybek et al 2013, J Obstet Gynaecol Res 39:632); and/or (ii) into which percentile the amount of cfDNA determined from the woman falls, from consideration of a reference distribution of amounts such as those determined from low-risk women or those which did not suffer from or develop preeclampsia, for example if the foetal cfDNA fraction falls within the 90th percentile of such a distribution, then the woman may be considered to have an increased risk of suffering mild or severe preeclampsia (Jakobsen et al 2013, Transfusion 53:1956). Other relevant factors may be considered in determining a suitable threshold amount. For example, a pregnant women who is also suffering from breast cancer, may have a higher bias of methylation at RASSF1A present in her plasma due to both factors. Analogously, certain embodiments of the present invention further include the step of: comparing the amount of said species of DNA detected with a threshold amount and/or reference distribution of amounts, wherein an amount of said species of DNA in excess to said threshold (or is not an outlier compared to said population) indicates that a diagnosis for an abnormality in the said species of DNA present in said sample may be performed on, preferably a separate aliquot of DNA of, said sample. For example, if foetal cfDNA fraction is greater than about 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1% or 0.5% of total cfDNA present in maternal plasma, then there would be sufficient fraction or foetal cfDNA to effectively conduct a subsequent test to investigate one or more characteristics of the foetal cfDNA, for example to investigate the chance or existence of a chromosomal anomaly of mutation comprised within such foetal cfDNA (such as using NIPT based on massively parallel sequencing). In the case of twin pregnancies, the inventors determine that a minimum foetal fraction of cfDNA for NIPT of a twin pregnancy could be considered to be 8%, or about 5%, 6%, 7%, 9% or 10%, and for monochorionic twin pregnancies with concordant genotypes (apart from rare exceptions, Chen et al, 2013, Am J Med Genet A, 161A:1817), a foetal cfDNA fraction of 4%, or about 2%, 3% or 5%, would be sufficient. Therefore, the present invention also includes embodiments where comprising a further step of: performing on, preferably with a separate aliquot of DNA of, said sample an in-vitro diagnosis for an abnormality in said species of DNA present in said sample; preferably wherein, said species of DNA originates from cells of a foetus and/or the placenta of a foetus, said sample is from a pregnant female and said diagnosis is a prenatal diagnosis. Such diagnosis directed at said species of DNA present may comprise a step that uses a detection technology selected from the group consisting of: DNA sequencing, SNP analysis, digital PCR and hybridization, and in particular embodiments said detection technology is massively parallel sequencing of DNA, such as massively parallel sequencing of random and/or (exon) enriched DNA. Such a diagnosis or test may be directed at the foetal DNA to identify a genetic mutation or chromosomal abnormality of the foetal DNA. Accordingly in certain embodiments, said species of DNA originates from cells of a foetus and/or the placenta of a foetus, said sample is from a pregnant female and said abnormality is a genetic mutation or a chromosomal abnormality, such as a chromosomal trisomy, associated with a foetal abnormality and/or a congenital disorder, In particular such embodiments, the genetic mutation is selected from the group consisting of: colour blindness, cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis, haemophilia, phenylketonuria, polycystic kidney disease, sickle-cell and disease, Tay-Sachs disease; and/or the chromosomal abnormality is selected from the group consisting of: a trisomy (such as trisomy 21, trisomy 18, or trisomy 13), a sex-chromosome abnormality (such as Turners syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Triple X syndrome, XXY syndrome, or Fragile X syndrome), a chromosomal deletion (such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cris-du-chat syndrome, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, or 22q11 deletion syndrome, Duchene muscular dystrophy), Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Canvan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis. In other embodiments, the genetic mutation or chromosomal abnormality may be one or more selected from those having a clinical utility gene cards (CUGCs) of the EuroGentest2 initiative (www.eurogentest.org). In particular embodiments, the chromosomal abnormality is a trisomy (such as trisomy 21, trisomy 18, or trisomy 13), a sex-chromosome abnormality or a chromosomal deletion. Such diagnosis or test may be directed at a species DNA to identify a genetic mutation or chromosomal abnormality of such DNA that is derived from a cell or cell-type associated with a medical condition. Accordingly in one of such embodiments, said species of DNA originates from cells of a tumour and said abnormality is a genetic mutation or a chromosomal abnormality associated with the diagnosis, prognosis or predictive treatment of a carcinoma or cancer. In particular such embodiments, the genetic mutation is selected from the group consisting of: a mutation in a tumour suppressor gene (such as TP53 (p53), BRCA1, BRCA2, APC or RB1), a mutation in a proto-oncogene (such as RAS, WNT, MYC, ERK, or TRK) and a DNA repair gene (such as HMGA1, HMGA2, MGMT or PMS2); and/or the chromosomal abnormality is a translocation (such as t(9;22)(q34;q11) [ie, Philadelphia chromosome or BCL-ABL], t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(11;14)(q13;q32), t(14;18)(q32;q21), t(10;(various))(q11;(various)), t(2;3)(q13;p25), t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(15;17)(q22;q21), t(12;15)(p13;q25), t(9;12)(p24;p13), t(12;21)(p12;q22), t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(2;5)(p23;q35), t(11;22)(q24;q11.2-12), t(17;22), t(1;12)(q21;p13), t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), t(1;19)(q10;p10), t(7,16)(q32-34;p11), t(11,16)(p11;p11), t(8,22)(q24;q11) or t(2;8)(p11;q24)).

Unless context dictates otherwise, the descriptions and definitions of the features set out above are not limited to any particular aspect or embodiment of the invention and apply equally to all aspects and embodiments which are described. All references, patents, and publications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Certain aspects and embodiments of the invention will now be illustrated by way of example and with reference to the description, figures and tables set out herein. Such examples of the methods, uses and other aspects of the present invention are representative only, and should not be taken to limit the scope of the present invention to only such representative examples. EXAMPLE 1: Use of the method of the invention in NIPT in multiple pregnancies, including in cases of vanishing twins Sample collection, processing and DNA extraction: 36 blood samples from women pregnant with multiple gestations (mono-, di- and trichorionic twin and triplet pregnancies) were collected between November 6th 2012 and November 16th 2013, for research & development (R&D) purposes and as part of routine non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) laboratory procedure. One blood sample came from a woman pregnant with triplets, the remaining 35 samples came from twin pregnancies. From each pregnant woman carrying a multiple pregnancy two samples each with 7-10ml venous blood were collected using Streck cell-free DNA blood collection tubes (Streck). The blood samples were shipped to the diagnostic laboratory with a maximum delivery time of 4 days. Other blood samples from pregnant females analysed herein were similarly collected. Plasma preparation was performed by centrifugation (1600g for 10min at 4°C) and plasma separation followed by a second centrifugation step (16000g for 10min at 4°C). Extraction of total cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was performed with QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer protocol using 3.0-4.0ml plasma with a final elution volume of 60ul AVE-buffer (Qiagen). DNA quantification: Foetal cell-free DNA (foetal cfDNA) was detected and quantified in relation to total cell-free DNA (total cfDNA) in order to determine the foetal cfDNA fraction as both a relative concentration and absolute amount using a method of the present invention. From the eluted cell-free DNA, 11ul were digested with the CpG-methylation sensitive enzymes HhaI (0.4U/ul), HpaII (0.3U/ul) and BstUI (0.3 U/ul) in a 22ul reaction using CutSmartTM Buffer (New England Biolabs). The reaction was incubated for 60min at 37°C and 60min at 60°C. 10ul from the digestion reaction was used as template DNA for quantitative probe-based PCR (reactions were conducted in duplicate), described briefly as follows. A 25ul PCR reaction using a 2-fold concentrated PCR master mix (QuantiFast Multiplex PCR Kit, Qiagen) was conducted. Primers that span CpG methylation sensitive restriction enzyme sites of the respective region that is differentially methylated between foetal and maternal DNA (as a DMR) were used in combination with FAM-labelled probes for such DMRs, and primers that do not span any restriction enzyme sites, an other region that is not differentially methylated between foetal and maternal DNA (as an OR) are used in combination with VIC-labelled probes for such ORs. The sequences of the primers and labelled probes used in this example are described in TABLE 1, and the thermocycler profiles used for the quantitative probe-based (TaqMan) PCR (LightCycler 480 II Instrument; Roche) are described in TABLE 2. In this example, the probes used to detect the presence of the two DMRs, are each labelled with the same detectable fluorescein amidite (FAM) fluorescent moiety, and each with the same minor binding grove (MGB) non-fluorescent quencher (NFQ) moiety, and the probes used to detect the presence of the two ORs, are each labelled with the same detectable VIC (life Technologies) fluorescent moiety, and each with the same MGBNFQ moiety.

In particular, the methylation insensitive locus located in RASSF1A is located between 8kb and 9kb (8.97kb) downstream of the methylation sensitive locus located in RASSF1A, and the methylation insensitive locus located in TBX3 is located between 10kb and 11kp (10.64kb) downstream of the methylation sensitive locus located in TBX3. FIGURE 2 depicts the respective arrangements and detection modalities of the two DMRs and the two other regions used in this example. Parallel probe-based quantitative PCR reactions were performed (in separate reactions within the same PCR run) using for template a serial dilution of male genomic DNA (Promega) having known concentrations as a standard. The foetal cfDNA fraction was calculated by relative quantification of signals in the FAM channel (DMR; ie detecting foetal cfDNA) versus the VIC channel (ORs; ie detecting total cfDNA), and the absolute total cfDNA amount was calculated by absolute quantification of signals in the VIC channel obtained from the sample compared to the VIC channel obtained from the dilution series of standard DNA of known concentration. Such relative and absolute quantifications were conducted using LightCycler 480 Software release 1.5.0 (Roche). Maternal plasma DNA sequencing and data analysis to identify foetal aneuploidy: DNA sequencing libraries were prepared using NEBNext Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit from Illumina. Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer protocol automated on a Hamilton STARplus robot. Library quality and quantity was measured using a Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent) and a Qbit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). Based on the library quantification dilutions and equimolar pools of 12 samples per pool were prepared. The pooled samples were sequenced on one lane of an Illumina v3 flow cell on an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer. Clonal clusters were generated using TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS on a cBot Cluster generation System according to the manufacturer protocol. Bioinformatic analysis to identify foetal chromosomal aneuploidy was carried out as described previously, with z-scores ≥3 indicating the presence of a foetal trisomy 21 (Stumm et al 2014, Europ Prenat Diag34:185). In cases of a positive test result for foetal aneuploidy from this method, the result was confirmed by invasive diagnostic methods. Results: Characteristics, % foetal fraction of cfDNA and aneuploidy test results for the blood samples are given in TABLE 3. There were two positive test results indicating foetal trisomy 21. Both were confirmed by karyotyping after amniocentesis; thus, the false positive rate in this study was 0%. One blood sample represented monochorionic twins with concordant karyotypes [47,XY,+21] and the other one represented dichorionic twins with discordant karyotypes [47,XY,+21 and 46,XX]. In both samples the foetal fraction was as high as 18.0 and 24.8 %, respectively. All other NIPT results were negative for trisomies 21, 18 and 13. There is no evidence for false-negative NIPT results so far in the pregnancies included in this study. Nevertheless, a number of pregnancies are still on-going (with the last birth of the patients expected in mid May 2014) and therefore, the final detection rate is still uncertain.

Different data and considerations have been published on how the lower limit of foetal cfDNA fraction should be defined to ensure that each twin's contribution is above the detection threshold (Leung et al 2013, Prenat Diag 33:675; Qu et al 2007, Am J Pathol 170:941; Struble et al 2013, Fetal Diagn Ther Dec 7 Epub ahead of print). This is especially important for dichorionic twin pregnancies with discordant karyotypes. In the study described above, supporting information was used for the definition of the minimum foetal cfDNA fraction for twin pregnancies derived from the Y-chromosomal representation, if only one of the two foetuses is male. Using the method of the present invention, the total foetal cfDNA fraction can be determined, which reflects the summary of foetal cfDNA derived from both foetuses. Using the Y-chromosomal representation from the next generation sequencing, the foetal cfDNA amount can be determined for male foetuses (as described in Stumm et al 2014). Thus, in the case of mixed foetal gender the contributing amount of each foetus can be determined by subtraction of the amount of foetal cfDNA determined by the Y-chromosomal representation from the foetal cfDNA fraction measured by method of the present invention. The foetal cfDNA fractions determined by the method of the present invention were compared with the values obtained from Y-chromosomal reads from next generation sequencing for cases with known gender (see FIGURE 3). There is a correlation of the amount of male specific cfDNA (y axis) to the foetal cfDNA fraction measured by method of the present invention (x axis). Thus, for twin pregnancies with male/male gender approximately true is: [y = x], for female/male genders it is: [y = 0.5x] and for female/female: [y = 1]. The genders of cases with similar values are male/male and in case of differing values with low Y-chromosomal representation the genders are female/female. The intermediate cases, which show about half the percentage of foetal fraction as Y-chromosomal representation, are of mixed gender. The data presented in FIGURE 3 show that it is not only possible to determine the foetal genders using NIPT results for twin pregnancies, but also that the measurement of the amount of foetal fraction of cfDNA determined by the method of the present invention is surprisingly accurate as compared to frequency counting of Y chromosome sequences. On the other hand, these data support the hypothesis that each foetus of a twin pregnancy contributes roughly about half of the total foetal cfDNA fraction. This leads to the conclusion that for twin pregnancies, twice the amount of foetal cfDNA would be required, and thus a recommended minimum foetal fraction of cfDNA for NIPT of a twin pregnancy could be considered to be 8%. For monochorionic twin pregnancies with concordant genotypes (apart from rare exceptions, Chen et al 2013, Am J Med Genet A 161A:1817), a foetal cfDNA fraction of 4 % would be enough to detect a foetal aneuploidy, just as for single pregnancies. However, for routine laboratory NIPT service one major issue speaks against the implication of such different quality criteria for mono- and dichorionic pregnancies: the determination of chorionicity is dependent on the gestational age and the practical experience of the physician performing the ultrasound examination. The chorionicity is clearly detectable in the first trimester of a multiple pregnancy, but in later stages detection becomes more difficult (Sperling et al 2001, Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand 80:287). Therefore, it is a safer strategy to generally define a minimum foetal cfDNA fraction for twin pregnancies, which is applicable for monochorionic as well as for dichorionic multiple pregnancies. Identification of vanishing twins: In two cases of NIPT aneuploidy testing in which the foetal cfDNA fraction was measured using the method of the present invention, identified a trisomy 21 (z-scores 13.5 and 3.4 respectively), but also a striking discrepancy between the total foetal cfDNA fraction measured by the method of the invention and the cf-Foetal-DNA amount measured by Y-chromosome representation were observed. For case A, two analyses of blood samples (first and back-up samples) estimated the total foetal cfDNA fraction measured the method of the present invention was 20.7% and 24.8%, respectively, whereas the foetal cfDNA according to the Y-chromosomal representation from next generation sequencing was 9.2 % and 9.3 %, respectively. It was speculated, and reported to the physician, that the pregnancy may be a mixed-sex twin pregnancy, who confirmed that a deceased twin had been observed during ultrasound scan at week 10. A further blood sample taken in the third trimester of the pregnancy (38+2) turned out to be negative for trisomy 21 and the foetal cfDNA amount measured by Y-chromosomal representation correlated with the foetal amount measured by QuantYfeX (21.7 % and 21.4), which matched the male gender determined by karyotyping of the living foetus. At birth a foetus papyraceus was found in the placental tissue from which a sufficient amount of cells could be isolated for cell culture and following GTG banding, a trisomy 21 positive, female karyotype was confirmed (47,XX,+21). For case B, a slightly increased Y-chromosomal representation was monitored indicating male specific cf-Foetal-DNA of 3.0 % and 2.7 % respectively. As the foetal cfDNA fraction estimates measured by the method of the invention were far above that (13.4 % and 10.0 %) we hypothesized from this discrepancy in the foetal fraction measured, that two foetuses with discordant gender contribute to the foetal fraction and the male foetus being the one affected by trisomy 21. This suggestion was derived from the correlation of Y-chromosome specific foetal cfDNA amount of roughly 3 % with the elevated z-score around the cut-off value of 3.0. Since the examination was clearly requested for a singleton pregnancy, the male specific foetal cfDNA was suspected to stem from a vanishing twin-maybe the carrier of a trisomy 21 - that was either not recognized or not indicated on the consent form for NIPT. Thus, the result was reported to be indecisive for chromosome 21 and the conflicting data was reported to the responsible physician, including a notice regarding the potential vanishing twin, for further clarification via ultrasound. The responsible physician subsequently confirmed that the pregnancy had started as twin and later continued as a singleton pregnancy. The gender of the living and apparently healthy foetus was confirmed to be female and thus, the foetal cfDNA that caused the increased z-score for trisomy 21 can clearly be assigned to a deceased male foetus. The pregnancy is still on-going and further analysis of placental tissue and blood of the living foetus is not yet possible. EXAMPLE 2: Improved detection sensitivity using two differentially methylated regions using the same detectable moiety/moieties for each differentially methylated region. The inventors were surprised to observe that a complex and multiplex reaction detecting two DMRs using the same detectable moiety/moieties for each of said DMR (as well as two other regions (OR) not differentially methylated) was more sensitive to detect foetal cfDNA fraction than previous detection reactions that each detected - in separate PCR reactions - a single DMR (as well as a single OR) (FIGURE 4). In a method of the present invention, two DMRs (those found in RASSF1A and TBX3, as described in Example 1) were detected (over 4 dilutions) with the same aliquot of DNA and reaction - effectively simultaneously (using quantitative probe-based (TaqMan) PCR) with two ORs (those found in RASSF1A and TBX3, as described in Example 1), using: (x) the same detectable moiety/moieties for each of said DMR; and (y) a detectable moiety/moieties for said at least one OR that is/are different to the detectable moiety/moieties used for said DMRs. In comparison, detection of foetal cfDNA fraction was less sensitive, as shown by detection at higher cycle numbers (Cp), if each DMR (and corresponding OR) was detected independently in separate reactions. The regions/markers, primers/probes and detection methodology was substantially as described in Example 1, except that for the single locus reactions, only the DMR and OR from a given gene (RASSF1A or TBX3) were detected simultaneously in a single reaction. In contrast, detection of foetal cf DNA fraction using a multiplex reaction of the two DMRs using different detectable moieties (eg FAM for the RASSF1A locus and VIC for the TBX3 locus) is determined to be even less sensitive, and further is difficult to detect simultaneously with any OR; without being bound by theory, believed due to the higher complexity of colour compensation, the limited number of separately detectable fluorescent markers and/or the "bleaching" effects from so many fluorescent markers being present in the same reaction. Given the exponential nature of quantitative PCR detection, a higher sensitivity of detection (ie lower cycle numbers) would also equate to higher accuracy of quantification, as the correction to standard curves, and interpolation between data points, would be subject to less error than that arising with the amounts of DNA correlating to detection at higher cycle numbers. EXAMPLE 3: Detection of an increased risk of a pregnant woman suffering from or developing preeclampsia (prophetic example). Using a method of the present example, pregnant women are assessed for their risk of suffering from or developing preeclampsia as follows. Firstly, a blood sample is collected from the woman for whom such risk to be assessed and total cfDNA extracted from the plasma of such sample substantially in accordance with the procedures described in Example 1. Secondly, using a method substantially as described in Example 1, a relative and/or absolute amount of foetal cfDNA and total cfDNA present in the plasma is determined, where the absolute amount of foetal and/or total cfDNA can be expressed as the amount of genome equivalents ("Eq"). Thirdly, such determined amount of cfDNA and/or total cfDNA is compared to a threshold amount or a reference distribution of amounts, and the women is determined to be at increased risk of suffering from or developing preeclampsia if the amount of foetal cfDNA or total cfDNA exceeds such threshold value and/or is an outlier in such distribution. For example, using published threshold values (Papantoniou et al 2013, Prenat Diag 33:682) if the total cfDNA exceeds an amount of about 7,500Eg/mL plasma or if the foetal cfDNA fraction exceeds an amount of about 500Eg/mL plasma, then the woman is determined to have such an increased risk. Such a risk may instead or additional be assessed by considering: (i) the fold-increase (eg 1.5, 3, 3.5 or 4-fold increase) of foetal cfDNA (determined for such woman compared to a threshold amount), factoring into the determination that for later-term pregnancies a higher fold-increase in foetal cfDNA may be utilised (Zeybek et al 2013, J Obstet Gynaecol Res 39:632); and/or (ii) into which percentile the amount of cfDNA determined from the woman falls, from consideration of a reference distribution of amounts determined from low-risk women or women who did not suffer from or develop preeclampsia, for example if the foetal cfDNA fraction falls within the 90th percentile of such a distribution, then the woman is considered to have an increased risk of suffering mild or severe preeclampsia (Jakobsen et al 2013, Transfusion 53:1956). In this example, t detection of a risk is conducted using a computer program product that performs the operations represented by FIGURE 5. Operation (A) receives signals (1) and (2) representing, respectively, foetal and total cfDNA are used by the computer program product to determine a parameter (4) that represents the relative and/or absolute amount of foetal (or total) cfDNA present in the plasma of the woman. This operation may optional receive a signal (3) representing an absolute amount of standard DNA. A second operation (B) compares such determined parameter (4) against a threshold amount (5) and/or a reference population of amounts (6) so as to determine and report (7) whether or not - and based on such comparison - the woman is determined to be at increase risk of suffering or developing preeclampsia. EXAMPLE 4: Detection of tumour-associated DNA in samples from cancer patients (prophetic example). Methylation of RASSF1A and at least one other DMR such as ER-beta (oestrogen receptor beta), RAR-beta2 (retinoic acid receptor beta 2) and/or Cyclin D2 is used to detect cfDNA derived from a tumour and to assess the risk of women suffering from breast cancer. Specific methylation at such DMRs is a characteristic of tumour-derived cfDNA, and a method of the present invention is used to detect and to quantify the amount tumour derived cfDNA in the plasma of women, and those determined to have elevated (or outlying) amounts of tumour-derived cfDNA are determined to be at increased risk from suffering from or developing breast cancer. Essentially, the process described in Example 3 is followed except that DMR2 and OR2 are located in one of ER-beta, RAR-beta2 or Cyclin D2, rather than TBX3. Primers and probes to detect such DMR2 and OR2 for use in this embodiment of the present invention are designable by the person of ordinary skill. In this example, a similar computer program product as described in Example 3 can be used to asses the risk for a given woman is based on the amount of tumour-derived cfDNA present in her blood, but in this example this parameter is compared against a threshold amount or distribution of amounts that is derived from a study of the amount of tumour-derived cfDNA present in control and breast-cancer patients; and those women having an elevated (or outlying) amount of tumour-derived cfDNA are considered to have an increased risk of suffering from or developing breast cancer.
