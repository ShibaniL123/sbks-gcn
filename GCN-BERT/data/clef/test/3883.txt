Step 4 Synthesis of Compound 36
Compound 35 (12.1 g, <65% purity, 60.3 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (60 mL), and the mixture was cooled in an ice bath. Allylchlorodimethylsilane (8.53 g, 63.3 mmol) and triethylamine (17.6 mL, 127 mmol) were added thereto, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 90 minutes. Then, saturated sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with dichloromethane. The solvent in the organic layer was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the obtained crude product (25.4 g) was purified by silicagel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to give Compound 36 (17.6 g, 42% purity, Yield 54%) as a colorless liquid.
