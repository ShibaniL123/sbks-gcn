Technical Field The present invention relates to catalytic conversion of ketoacids, including methods for increasing the molecular weight of ketoacids, products obtainable by such methods, as well as use of such products for the production of liquid hydrocarbons and/or gasoline or diesel fuel or base oil components. Background Art Production of hydrocarbons used as fuel or base oil components and chemicals from biomass are of increasing interests since they are produced from a sustainable source of organic compounds. The ketoacid Levulinic acid (LA, 4-oxopentanoic acid) is one of many platform molecules that may be derived from biomass. It may be produced from both pentoses and hexoses of lignocellulosic material (see figure 1) at relatively low cost. Some of the advantages and drawbacks of using levulinic acid as a platform molecule relates to the fact that it is considered to be a reactive molecule due to both its keto and acid functionality. Esters of levulinic acid have been suggested as fuel components as well as cold flow additives in diesel fuels, and in particular the methyl and ethyl esters have been used as additives in diesel fuel. Gamma-valerolactone (GVL), which may be obtained by reduction of levulinic acid, has been used as a fuel additive in gasoline. Further reduction of GVL to 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) provides a product that may be blended with gasoline of up to 60%. Alkyl valerates produced from levulinic acid have also been suggested as biofuels. Levulinic acid has also been used for the production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels by a number of catalytic routes, including a method of producing a distribution of alkenes, the distribution centered around C12, involving converting aqueous GVL in a first reactor system to butenes followed by oligomerization in a second reactor over an acidic catalyst (e.g. Amberlyst® 70). Serrano-Ruiz et al. (Appl. Catal., B, 2010, 100, 184) produced a C9-ketone (5-nonanone) by reducing levulinic acid to GVL over a Ru/C catalyst in one reactor followed by reacting 40 wt% GVL in water and 0.02 M H2SO4 in a Pd/Nb2O5 + ceria-zirconia double bed arrangement at 325-425 °C, 14 bar, WHSV = 0.8-0.5 h-1 in another reactor. Using multiple reactors may be advantageous as it can offer more control over the process compared to using a single reactor. However, multiple reactors increase the number of process steps, which increases the capital expenditure of the process. US 2006/0135793 A1 (to Blessing and Petrus) disclose dimerization of levulinic acid to a C10 unit in the presence of hydrogen, with a strong acidic heterogenous catalyst, e.g. ion exchange resin catalyst, comprising a hydrogenating metal, at a temperature in the range from 60 to 170°C and a pressure of 1 to 200 bar (absolute). The example indicates as main products levulinic acid dimers (26 %) and unreacted levulinic acid (70 %). Relatively low reaction temperatures are preferred due to the thermal instability of ion exchange resins at temperatures of above 150 °C. Summary of Invention Using a single reactor compared to multiple reactors may be advantageous in that they reduce the number of process steps and therefore increase the process economy. Some of the drawbacks associated with direct routes of upgrading e.g. by using single reactors are that these reactions generate highly reactive intermediates with more than one functional group, which can further react to other undesired molecules. Reduction of undesired molecules by direct routes of upgrading usually entails a lower yield of the desired product composition. Usually the suppression of side reactions producing undesired molecules is accomplished by using dilute aqueous solutions of levulinic acid as feedstock. Accordingly, an indirect route of upgrading a feedstock using multiple reactors or multiple catalyst beds in a single reactor may in some situations be preferred compared to a direct route of upgrading. Consequently, there is a need for additional processes for upgrading levulinic acid and other ketoacids to higher molecular weight compounds, which are suitable for use as e.g. fuel or base oil components or chemicals or as components in the production of fuel or base oil components or chemicals. In particular, there is a need for such additional processes, which reduce the processing costs by i.a. improving the yield of the desired components or chemicals and/or reduce the overall catalyst consumption by improving the life time of the catalyst. The present invention was made in view of the prior art described above, and one of the objects of the present invention is to provide methods that enable upgrading of ketoacids such as levulinic acid to higher molecular weight compounds. Another object of the present invention is to provide the upgrade of ketoacids to higher molecular weight compounds in good yield and at low processing costs. To solve the problem, the present invention provides a method for increasing the molecular weight of a ketoacid, the method comprising the steps of providing in a reactor a feedstock comprising at least one ketoacid, subjecting the feedstock to one or more C-C-coupling reaction(s), wherein the C-C-coupling reaction(s) are conducted in the presence of a solid acid catalyst system comprising a first metal oxide and a second metal oxide and wherein the content of the at least one ketoacid in the feedstock is at least 30 wt-%. In the step of subjecting the feedstock to one or more C-C-coupling reaction(s), the at least one ketoacid undergoes at least one C-C-coupling reaction with another ketoacid or ketoacid derivative present in the feedstock so as to increase the molecular weight of the ketoacid. The ketoacids participating in the C-C-coupling reaction may be of the same type having the same chemical formula or of a different type. The ketoacid derivate includes all compounds directly obtainable from the ketoacid through C-C-coupling reactions or other reactions. The ketoacid derivatives may be selected from the list consisting of lactones and lactone derivatives of ketoacids, and pentanoic acid. In a C-C-coupling reaction the at least one ketoacid reacts with another reactant with the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond in the product. In other words, the molecular weight of the ketoacid is increased using the ketoacid as a direct precursor (one-step reaction) and within a single reactor or a single catalyst bed. As a matter of course, further C-C-coupling reactions may occur so as to further increase the molecular weight the C-C-coupling reaction product. These further reactions are conducted in the same (single) reactor or catalyst bed. That is, the inventors of the present invention in a first aspect of the invention found that a solid acid catalyst system comprising a first metal oxide and a second metal oxide catalyses multiple types of C-C-coupling reactions of ketoacids in a strong solution (at least 30 wt-%) of ketoacids enabling the production of higher molecular weight compounds of ketoacids at a good yield and in a reactor. Using strong solutions of ketoacids allows for high probability of C-C-coupling reactions between two ketoacids, thus providing a high yield of desired products and low amounts of side-products. The solvent of the (strong) solution may be any ketoacid, preferably the "at least one ketoacid". In addition, water and/or organic solvents may be used. Preferably, the at least one ketoacid acts as a solvent. The catalyst system preferably has a specific surface area of from 10 to 500 m2/g. The specific surface is generally determined by the BET method, which measures the adsorption isotherm of nitrogen (ASTM D-3663). Preferably, the catalyst system has a total amount of acid sites in the range of 30 and 500 µmol/g. The total number of acid sites can be measured with NH3-TPD method, which is a commonly used method for determining the number of acid sites and has been disclosed e.g. in M. Lashdaf et al, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials 75 (2004) 149-158. In the NH3-TPD method, adsorption temperature of NH3 of 200 °C is used. In the present invention, the at least one ketoacid is preferably a γ-ketoacid, most preferably levulinic acid. In addition to the at least one ketoacid, one or more further ketoacids may be employed. The reactor employed in the method of the present invention may be a flow reactor, preferably a continuous flow reactor, or a batch reactor, preferably under stirring. A flow reactor type is preferred from the viewpoint of production efficiency. When using a flow reactor, the catalyst system is preferably immobilized in the reactor. The invention provides a method for industrial scale production of higher molecular weight products of ketoacids and, therefore, the C-C-coupling reactions are conducted using a feedstock having a high concentration of ketoacids. Preferably, the content of the at least one ketoacid in the feedstock is at least 40 wt-%, preferably at least 50 wt-%, more preferably at least 70 wt-%, even more preferably at least 90 wt-%, and even more preferably at least 95 wt-%. If multiple ketoacids are present in the feedstock, the "content of the at least one ketoacid" refers to the total content of all ketoacids. In this respect, it is to be noted that the term "feedstock" in the present invention includes all material fed to the reactor except for the material constituting the catalyst system. Thus, the calculation of the content of the at least one ketoacid in the feedstock does not consider the amount of catalyst. Water has been found to decrease the formation of coke precursors during the C-C-coupling reactions but it has been also found to decrease the activity of catalyst system. The content of water in the feedstock is preferably less than 5.0 wt-%, and more preferably less than 2.0 wt-% and even more preferably less than 1.0 wt-%. The calculation of the content of water in the feedstock does not consider the amount of catalyst. There are several metal oxides, which can be used in the catalyst system to catalyse the C-C-coupling reactions of ketoacids. Preferably the first metal oxide comprises an oxide of one of W, Be, B, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Bi, La, Ce, Th and the second metal oxide comprises an oxide of one of Zr, Ti, Si, Al, V, Cr or a combination of these, the first metal oxide not being same as second metal oxide. Combinations of metal oxides include mixtures of individual metal oxides (solid solutions), mixed metal oxides and supported metal oxides. Preferably, the catalyst system comprises a mixture of the first metal oxide and the second metal oxide, wherein the second metal oxide is at least one selected from zirconia, titania, silica, vanadium oxide, chromium oxide, preferably zirconia or titania. In the present invention, the mixture of metal oxides includes a mixture of individual metal oxide materials, e.g. in a powder form, mixed metal oxides, where the metal oxides form a common matrix, and supported metal oxides, where the more active metal oxide is deposited on the metal oxide acting as a carrier. Various methods can be used for the preparation of mixtures of metal oxides. In preparation of mixed metal oxides, metal oxide precursors are brought together from gas phase or liquid solution before transformation into oxide form. In preparation of supported metal oxides, a metal oxide precursor is brought from gas phase or liquid solution onto a solid support in oxide (or hydroxide) form before the transformation of the metal oxide precursor into oxide form. Preferably, the first metal oxide is supported on a second metal oxide carrier, wherein the second metal oxide is preferably selected from the group consisting of zirconia, titania, silica, vanadium oxide, chromium oxide, preferably zirconia or titania. Preferably the surface density of metal atoms of the first metal oxide supported on the second metal oxide is from 0.5 to 20 metal atoms/nm2. The surface density of metal atoms of the first metal oxide in the catalyst system is calculated based on the content of metal oxide in the catalyst and specific surface area of the catalyst system. Preferably, the catalyst system comprises tungsten oxide, ceria or silica supported on a metal oxide carrier, wherein the carrier is preferably selected from the group consisting of zirconia, titania, silica, vanadium oxide, chromium oxide, preferably zirconia or titania. A carrier constituted of multiple oxides selected from the above second metal oxides may be employed as well. Preferably, the first metal oxide is tungsten oxide, ceria or silica and the content of the first metal oxide in the catalyst system is 1.0 to 40.0 wt-%, preferably 2.0 to 30.0 wt-%, further preferably 13.0 to 30.0 wt-%, calculated by weight of the metal oxide in relation to the total mass of the catalyst. The metal oxide content is determined by measuring the metal content in the catalyst and calculating the content of the metal oxide in which the metal is present in the highest oxidation number, if multiple (stable) oxides of one metal exist. Preferably, the feedstock is introduced into the reactor in liquid phase, as opposed to for example the gaseous phase. One of the advantages of introducing the feedstock into the reactor in the liquid phase is that it is not required to heat the feedstock to prepare a gaseous stream. Further, the presence of solid components in the feedstock may lead to clogging of the catalyst. Therefore, it is preferred that the feedstock is in liquid phase and does not include a considerable amount of solid material, e.g. less than 4.0 wt-%, preferably less than 1.0 wt-%, more preferably less than 0.2 wt-% of solid material. Here, solid material includes solid material suspended or dispersed in a liquid phase. The C-C-coupling reaction(s) can be controlled by adjusting several parameters, including by selection of reaction conditions such as: temperature, pressure, and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) (kg feedstock/kg catalyst per hour). The C-C-coupling reaction(s) are preferably conducted at a temperature of 200-350 °C, preferably 210-300 °C, more preferably 220-280 °C and even more preferably 220- 260 °C. This temperature range was found to be particularly suitable for obtaining a high degree of reaction products of medium molecular weight (C8-C25) while avoiding excessive polymerization and coking of the catalyst. Preferably the C-C-coupling reaction(s) are conducted at a pressure of 0.5-100 bar, preferably 1.0-50 bar, more preferably 1.0-20 bar. The C-C-coupling reactions are preferably conducted at a weight hourly space velocity of 0.05 h-1 to 2.0 h-1, preferably 0.1 h-1 to 1.8 h-1, more preferably 0.2 h-1 to 1.5 h-1, most preferably 0.25 h-1 to 1.25 h-1. The WHSV has an influence on the composition of the resulting material, since it determines the effective contact time of reagent and catalyst. The above-mentioned ranges have shown to provide a high degree of favourable products. The C-C-coupling reaction(s) may be conducted in the presence of hydrogen. In this case, the hydrogen is fed to the reactor as part of the feedstock, either simultaneously with the remainder of the feedstock, or introduced via a separate inlet within the reactor. It is also possible to conduct the C-C-coupling reaction(s) in the absence of hydrogen and to recover the catalyst by adding hydrogen to the reaction or in the course of a wash step mixture from time to time. The C-C-coupling reactions may be conducted at a feed ratio (H2/liquid feedstock) of 100-3000 NI/l, preferably 200-2000 NI/l, more preferably 500-1800 NI/l and most preferably 500-1500 NI/l. Here the liquid feedstock refers to feedstock, which is predominantly in liquid form at the reaction conditions. If the C-C-coupling reaction(s) are conducted in the presence of hydrogen, the catalyst system may also comprise at least one hydrogenation metal selected from Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements, preferably from Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt. In a further aspect of the present invention, a C-C-coupling reaction product obtainable by the method according to the present invention is provided. In another aspect of the present invention, a method for producing hydrocarbons from a feedstock comprising at least one ketoacid is provided. In still another aspect of the present invention, a hydrocarbon composition obtainable by the method according to the present invention is provided. Brief Description of Drawings Figure 1 shows a scheme illustrating conversion of lignocellulosic material to levulinic acid. Figure 2 shows a scheme illustrating some reaction products of levulinic acid, including potential coke precursors and potential C-C-coupling precursors. The figure is not intended to cover all reaction products of levulinic acid, nor is it intended to show all types of coke precursors. Figure 2 illustrates one possible mechanism for reducing the angelica lactone coke precursors by hydrogenation, and also illustrates that the intermolecular ester of 4-hydroxypentanoic acid, GVL, may be in equilibrium with 4-hydroxypentanoic acid itself. Figure 3 shows an overview of a possible process scheme for further upgrading the products from the C-C-coupling reactions. Figure 4 shows an overview of a possible process scheme for preparing and upgrading the products from the C-C-coupling reactions. Detailed description of the invention One of the challenges in increasing the molecular weight of ketoacids by C-C-coupling reactions is the high reactivity of the product intermediates, which results in too high a degree of oligomerisation of the starting components. The inventors have found that the oligomerisation of a ketoacid, specifically of levulinic acid, in the presence of a solid base catalyst such as K2O/TiO2 results in high formation of coke and tar, which poison the catalyst by inhibiting the reactive sites on the surface of the catalyst and eventually result in plugging of the reactor. Without being bound to any theory this is suggested to occur due to reactions of levulinic acid to more reactive precursors such as angelica lactones, which are known to have a high tendency to polymerise at temperatures of over 200 °C. It was attempted to reduce the undesired polymerization reactions and to control the oligomerization reactions and coking by conducting the reactions in dilute aqueous solutions. The addition of water to suppress coking reactions was, however, found also to decrease the performance of the base catalyst resulting in low yields of the desired oligomerization products. The invention is based on a surprising finding that the molecular weight of ketoacids can be selectively increased by subjecting the ketoacids to C-C-coupling reactions in the presence of a solid acid catalyst system comprising a first metal oxide and a second metal oxide. The use of a solid acid catalyst system comprising a first and a second metal oxide has been found to suppress the coking tendency of the reaction intermediates and simultaneously to catalyze multiple types of C-C-coupling reactions resulting in formation of new carbon-carbon bonds between the reactants in solutions. Accordingly, one aspect the present invention is a method for increasing the molecular weight of a ketoacid, the method comprising the steps of providing in a reactor a feedstock comprising at least one ketoacid, subjecting the feedstock to one or more C-C-coupling reaction(s), wherein the C-C-coupling reaction(s) are conducted in the presence of a solid acid catalyst system comprising a first metal oxide and a second metal oxide and wherein the content of the at least one ketoacid in the feedstock is at least 30 wt-% . The present invention also relates to a method for increasing the molecular weight of ketoacids. Ketoacids are organic molecules that have both a keto function (>C=O) as well as a carboxylic acid (COOH) or carboxylate (COO-) function. In the present specification special forms of ketoacids include embodiments where the keto function is an aldehyde (-CH=O). In the present invention, the ketoacid may for example be an alpha-ketoacid (such as pyruvic acid, oxaloacetic acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid), beta-ketoacid (such as acetoacetic acid), gamma-ketoacid (such as levulinic acid), or delta-ketoacid. The ketoacid may have more than one keto functionality, and more than one carboxylic acid function. Preferably, the ketoacid only has one keto functionality and one carboxylic acid functionality. Scheme 1 illustrates exemplary ketoacids according to the present invention, for example where n and m are integers each selected independently of each other from the list consisting of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Preferably, the ketoacid is a gamma ketoacid, preferably levulinic acid (m=2, n=0). Preferably, the molecular weight of the ketoacids in the feedstock is increased by at least 40% or more. Preferably, the molecular weight is increased to be from 150 to 1000 g/mol, such as 160 to 500 g/mol. Where the ketoacid is a C4-C7-ketoacid, the molecular weight may be increased to corresponding molecules having a C7-C35 carbon chain, such as a C8-C30 carbon chain. For example it is preferably that more than 50 wt% of the reaction product belong to the group containing dimerization, trimerisation, tetramerisation, pentamerisation, and hexamerisation products of ketoacid. By dimerization, trimerisation, tetramerisation, pentamerisation and hexamerisation products is meant reaction products relating to two, three, four, five and six molecules of one or more of ketoacids being coupled together. In the case of a feedstock comprising derivatives of ketoacids in addition to ketoacids, the dimerization, trimerisation, tetramerisation, pentamerisation, and hexamerisation products may additionally contain mixed C-C-coupling products comprising one or more ketoacids and/or derivatives thereof. The dimerisation, trimerisation, tetramerisation, pentamerisation, and hexamerisation products are derived from at least one ketoacid, such as at least two ketoacids, at least three ketoacids, at least four ketoacid, at least five ketoacids, at least six ketoacids. In the present invention the molecular weight of the keto acids are increased through one or more C-C-coupling reaction(s). Many C-C-coupling reactions are known in the art, and the skilled person would be able to identify such C-C-coupling reactions based on the reaction conditions provided. In particular the C-C-coupling reactions may be ketonisation reactions or reactions proceeding through an enol or enolate intermediate. In the present invention, the C-C-coupling reactions may be selected from the list comprising: aldol-type reactions and condensations, ketonisations, reactions where the C-C-coupling involves an alkene, as well as other oligomerisation reactions. The C-C-coupling reactions may proceed with two identical types of molecules (i.e. the same compound) or may be a crossed reaction between two different types of molecules (i.e. between different compounds). The reactivity of the catalyst depends on the number of active sites on the surface of the catalyst and on the specific surface of the catalyst. Preferably, the catalyst system has a specific surface area of from 10 to 500 m2/g. The catalyst system having a specific surface area in these ranges have shown to provide enough reactivity to obtain high yield of desired C-C-coupling reaction products such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers and hexamers of a ketoacid but at the same time to minimize the reactions of ketoacids to coke precursors. The reactivity of a solid acid catalyst system depends also on the total amount of acid sites, which is preferably in the range of 30 and 500 µmol/g. Preferably the feedstock comprises as the major component one or more ketoacids. For example, the content of the at least one ketoacid in the feedstock is at least 40 wt-% such as at least 50 wt-%, at least 70 wt-%, at least 90 wt-%, or at least 95 wt-%. Preferably the content of water in the feedstock is less than 5.0 wt-%, preferably less than 2.0 wt-%, more preferably less than 1.0 wt-%. Preferably, no water is present in the feedstock. Nevertheless, internal water may be produced in some condensation reactions. The conversion of ketoacid to desired C-C-coupling reaction products was found to increase as the content of ketoacid in the feedstock increased. Presence of water was found to decrease the reactions of levulinic acid to coke precursors but addition of water also decreased catalyst activity and the yield of desired C-C-coupling reaction products was lowered. The yield of C-C-coupling products has to be high enough to enable an economically feasible process for production of fuel components and chemicals from ketoacids. The feedstock may be obtained from processing of lignocellulosic material, and such processed material may be used directly, or purified to varying degrees before being used as a feedstock in the method of the present invention. The levulinic acid may be produced e.g. with the Biofine method disclosed in US5608105. Preferably, the feedstock comprises levulinic acid and the levulinic acid may be combined with one or more other ketoacids or derivatives of ketoacids. The ketoacid derivatives may be selected from the list consisting of lactones and lactone derivatives of ketoacids, and pentanoic acid. The feedstock may comprise a mixture of levulinic acid in combination with ketoacid derivatives, such as at least 30 wt-% of levulinic acid and at least 10 wt-% of levulinic acid derivative(s) based on the total mass of feedstock. In addition to ketoacids and ketoacid derivatives, the feedstock may also contain aldehydes, such as furfural or hydroxymethylfurfural. Preferably the first metal oxide of the catalyst system used in the invention comprises an oxide of one of W, Be, B, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Bi, La, Ce, Th and the second metal oxide comprises an oxide of one of Zr, Ti, Si, Al, V, Cr or a combination of these, the first metal oxide not being same as second metal oxide. Combinations of metal oxides include solid mixtures of metal oxide materials, mixed metal oxides and supported metal oxides. More preferably the catalyst system comprises a mixture of the first metal oxide and the second metal oxide, wherein the second metal oxide is at least one selected from zirconia, titania, silica, vanadium oxide, chromium oxide, preferably zirconia or titania. The catalyst system may comprise a mixture of tungsten oxide, ceria or silica and at least one oxide selected from zirconia, titania, silica, vanadium oxide, chromium oxide, preferably zirconia or titania. Preferably the catalyst system comprises tungsten oxide, ceria or silica supported on a metal oxide carrier, wherein the carrier is selected from the group consisting of zirconia, titania, silica, vanadium oxide, chromium oxide, preferably zirconia or titania. Here, the tungsten, cerium or silicon oxides represent the metal oxides having higher activity. These oxides have shown to provide good reaction properties. Furthermore, the carriers mentioned above have shown to provide good carrier properties without affecting the function of the more active part, including a synergistic interaction. Moreover, the combinations mentioned above allow using the catalyst for a long period of time without deterioration and/ or dissolution in the acidic reaction medium and thus allow for reduced overall catalyst consumption. Preferably the content of the first metal oxide in the catalyst system is 1.0 to 40.0 wt-%, preferably 2.0 to 30.0 wt-%, further preferably 13.0 to 30.0 wt-%, calculated by weight of the metal oxide relative to the total mass of the catalyst. Preferably, the feedstock is provided in a single reactor, or single reactor bed. The reactor should be able to be pressurised, and to accommodate the feedstock and the catalyst system. The reactor should have means, such as one or more inlets and/or outlets, for supplying gases and adding/withdrawing feedstock. In addition, means for controlling the pressure and temperature are preferably present. The feedstock is preferably introduced into the reactor in liquid phase, as opposed to for example the gaseous phase. One of the advantages of introducing the feedstock into the reactor in the liquid phase is that it is not required to heat the feedstock to prepare a gaseous stream. Further, the presence of solid components in the feedstock may lead to clogging of the catalyst. Therefore, it is preferred that the feedstock is in liquid phase and does not include a considerable amount of solid material, e.g. less than 4.0 wt-%, preferably less than 1.0 wt-%, more preferably less than 0.2 wt-% of solid material. Here, solid material includes solid material dispersed or suspended in a liquid phase. The C-C-coupling reaction(s) are conducted predominantly in the liquid phase, as opposed to the gaseous phase, meaning that the reaction is at least predominantly taking place on the catalyst in the liquid phase. The C-C-coupling reaction(s) may be conducted entirely in the liquid phase. The inventors found that the C-C coupling reaction(s) can be controlled by adjusting several parameters, including appropriate selection of reaction conditions such as: temperature, pressure, and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) and reaction time/residence time. The reaction temperature has been found to have a significant effect on the product distribution. At temperatures below 200 °C the yield of C-C-coupling products may be too low and at temperatures above 400 °C the yield may be decreased due to formation coke and other non-desired polymerization products. The C-C-coupling reaction(s) are preferably conducted at a temperature of 200-400 °C, preferably 210-300 °C, more preferably 220-280 °C and even more preferably 220- 260 °C. The above cited temperature ranges were found to be particularly suitable for obtaining a high degree of reaction products of medium molecular weight (C8-C30) while avoiding excessive polymerization and coking of the catalyst. Since most of the C-C-coupling reactions take place in liquid phase the pressure and temperature are suitably selected to keep the reactants in liquid phase. Advantageously, the C-C-coupling reaction(s) are conducted at a pressure of 0.5-100 bar, preferably 1.0-50 bar, more preferably 1.0-20 bar. The C-C-coupling reactions are preferably conducted at a weight hourly space velocity (kg feedtock/kg catalyst*hour) of 0.05 h-1 to 2.0 h-1, preferably 0.1 h-1 to 1.8 h-1, more preferably 0.2 h-1 to 1.5 h-1, most preferably 0.25 h-1 to 1.25 h-1. The WHSV has an influence on the composition of the resulting material, since it determines the effective contact time of reagent and catalyst. The above-mentioned ranges have shown to provide a high degree of favourable products. The C-C coupling reaction(s) may proceed in the presence of hydrogen which is fed into the reactor as part of the feedstock. The hydrogen may be mixed with one or more other gasses, preferably an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, helium or another of the noble gasses, or gas behaving inertly to the reaction conditions of the present invention. By behaving inertly it is considered that the gas should not to a major extent participate as a reaction member, and preferably the inert gas should participate as little as possible, such as not participate at all. The performance of the catalyst system was found to be further improved by the addition of hydrogen in the feed diminishing the degree of oligomerization and conversion of ketoacid to undesired components. The hydrogen addition will not introduce hydrogenation activity unless the catalyst system comprises a hydrogenation metal but it is proposed to modify the surface properties of the reducible metal oxide which is part of the catalyst system. The C-C-coupling reactions may be conducted at a flow ratio (H2/liquid feedstock) of 100-3000 NI/l, preferably 200-2000 NI/l, more preferably 500-1800 NI/l and most preferably 500-1500 NI/l. When conducting the reaction in the presence of hydrogen, the catalyst system may comprise at least one hydrogenation metal in addition to the first and second metal oxides. The hydrogenation metal is preferably selected from Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements, preferably from Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt. A catalyst system comprising a hydrogenation metal was found to further increase the stability of the catalyst and to suppress the oligomerization reactions to components not suitable for use as fuel components or chemicals. In another aspect of the present invention, a C-C-coupling reaction product obtainable by the method according to the present invention is provided. This product may be directly used as fuel or base oil components or chemicals or as intermediate components in production of fuel or base oil components or chemicals. The C-C-coupling reaction product obtainable by the methods of the present invention may - if desired - be further subjected to a hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) step to remove oxygen, which preferably produces completely deoxygenated material (i.e. hydrocarbon compounds having no oxygen atoms). The produced hydrocarbons may be used as fuel or base oil components or chemicals or as starting components in the production of fuel or base oil components or chemicals. The hydrodeoxygenated products may also be further isomerized to isoparaffins. One of the advantages of the present invention is that ketoacids produced from renewable materials can be upgraded to higher molecular weight hydrocarbons and/or hydrocarbon derivatives, which may be used as fuel or base oil components or chemicals or as starting components in the production of fuel or base oil components or chemicals. The C-C-coupling reaction products may be fractionated to remove potential unreacted ketoacid monomers and other low molecular weight components such as water and CO2 formed in the C-C-coupling reactions from the reaction product as illustrated in Figure 3. The fractionation can be conducted by any conventional means such as distillation. The unreacted ketoacid monomer may optionally be recycled and combined with the feed of the first reactor. Another aspect of the present invention involves a method for production of hydrocarbons, the method comprising steps of increasing the molecular weight of a ketoacid by using the method of the present invention to obtain a C-C-coupling reaction product and subjecting the C-C-coupling reaction product to a hydrodeoxygenation step and optionally to an isomerization step. The HDO catalyst employed in the hydrodeoxygenation step may comprise a hydrogenation metal on a support, such as for example a HDO catalyst selected from a group consisting of Pd, Pt, Ni, Co, Mo, Ru, Rh, W or any combination of these. The hydrodeoxygenation step may for example be conducted at a temperature of 100-500 °C and at a pressure of 10-150 bar. Water and light gases may be separated from the HDO product with any conventional means such as distillation. After the removal of water and light gases the HDO product may be fractionated to one or more fractions suitable for use as gasoline, aviation fuel, diesel or base oil components. The fractionation may be conducted by any conventional means, such as distillation. Optionally part of the product of the HDO step may be recycled and combined to the feed of the HDO reactor. Another aspect of the present invention involves a hydrocarbon composition obtainable by the method according to the present invention. This product may be used as fuel or base oil components or chemicals or as intermediate components in production of fuel or base oil components or chemicals. Another aspect of present invention involves a hydrocarbon composition comprising at least 30 wt-% paraffins, at least 50 wt-% naphthenes, less than 10 wt-% aromatics, and wherein at least 70 wt-% of the hydrocarbons have a carbon number from 8 to 10.

The product of the hydrodeoxygenation step may also be subjected to an isomerization step in the presence of hydrogen and an isomerization catalyst. Both the hydrodeoxygenation step and isomerisation step may be conducted in the same reactor. The isomerisation catalyst may be a noble metal bifunctional catalyst, for example Pt-SAPO or Pt-ZSM-catalyst. The isomerization step may for example be conducted at a temperature of 200-400 °C and at a pressure of 20-150 bar. It is preferred that only a part of the HDO product is subjected to an isomerization step, in particular the part of HDO product which is subjected to isomerization may be the heavy fraction boiling at or above temperature of 300 °C. The hydrocarbon product obtainable from the hydrodeoxygenation and/or the isomerisation step may be used as fuel or base oil components or chemicals or as intermediate components in production of fuel or base oil components or chemicals. Generally the choice of subjecting HDO product to isomeration is highly dependable of the desired properties of the end products. In case the HDO product contains a high amount of n-paraffins, the HDO product may be subjected to isomerization step to convert at least part of the n-paraffins to isoparaffins to improve the cold properties of the end product. Examples Materials As example catalysts, WO3/ZrO2, CeO2/ZrO2 and SiO2/ZrO2 with the compositions presented in Table 1 were used in the C-C-coupling reactions of levulinic acid. The catalysts are available from Saint-Gobain NORPRO. Table 1.

The atom densities of the metal of the first metal oxides have been calculated based on the specific surface areas of the catalysts and content of respective metal oxide in the catalyst. The specific surface areas provided by the catalyst manufacturer have been determined by the BET method, which measures the adsorption isotherm of nitrogen (ASTM D-3663). Example 1 Increasing the molecular weight of levulinic acid by C-C coupling reactions with WO3/ZrO2-catalyst system The performance of WO3/ZrO2-catalyst (sample SZ 6*143) was evaluated in a continuous tubular flow reactor test run with commercial grade levulinic acid (97 %, Sigma-Aldrich) as feedstock. The C-C coupling reactions were conducted at temperatures ranging from about 200 °C to about 240 °C and under a pressure of about 20 bar, using a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 h-1. The reactions were conducted in nitrogen or hydrogen flow (50 ml/min) to study the effect of hydrogen added to the feed. WHSV was calculated from the amount of levulinic acid fed in vessel. For reactions at various conditions the amount of gas formed was determined from the liquid yield (gas = 100 - liquid product). The liquid product consists of the organic phase including water formed in the reaction. A rough estimate of the amount of water in liquid product was obtained by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The quantitative amount of LA (levulinic acid) and GVL (γ-valerolactone) in liquid product was determined by HPLC analysis. The relative amount of dimers and oligomers in the organic phase was obtained from GPC chromatograms. The composition of the organic phase, - including unreacted LA, was calculated relative to the dry liquid product (without the amount of water). The product yields and compositions of the organic phase for conversion of levulinic acid on WO3/TiO2 catalyst system in nitrogen and hydrogen flow are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2.

The product of EX 8 was used as C-C-coupling reaction product feedstock for hydrodeoxygenation experiments in Example 3. Example 2 Increasing the molecular weight of levulinic acid by C-C coupling reactions with WO3/ZrO2-, CeO2/ZrO2- and SiO2/ZrO2-catalyst systems The performance of WO3/ZrO2-, CeO2/ZrO2- and SiO2/ZrO2-catalysts was compared in batch reactor test runs with commercial grade levulinic acid (97 %, Sigma Aldrich) as feed. The catalysts were dried at 120 °C in nitrogen flow overnight before being loaded into the reactor. The reactor was loaded with 5 g catalyst and 50 g levulinic acid. The test runs were carried out at 200 °C and 20 bar under nitrogen. Liquid samples withdrawn after 2 hours at 200 °C were analysed for their composition by the GPC method. Table 4.

Example 3 Hydrodeoxygenation of the C-C coupling reaction product fractions to produce hydrocarbons In this example, the C-C-coupling reaction product of Experiment 8 in Example 1 was subjected to a hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) step to remove heteroatoms (in particular oxygen) and to stabilize the oil product. The C-C-coupling reaction product used as feed to the HDO reactor contained 24 wt-% oligomers, 35 wt-% dimers and 41 wt-% of unreacted levulinic acid, which was not removed before feeding to HDO step. Hydrodeoxygenation was carried out in a tubular flow reactor in presence of sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst at temperature of 310 °C and under a pressure of 80 bar using hydrogen to feed (H2/feed) ratio of 3300 NI/l and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.3 h-1. WHSV and hydrogen to hydrocarbon ratio is calculated from the amount of tested oil fed in vessel. The HDO product distribution presented in Table 5 was determined by simulated GC-distillations and the success of oxygen removal was evaluated from FTIR spectra. The HDO product was distilled into gasoline and diesel fractions. The chemical composition of the gasoline fraction was determined by GC-MS and PIONA analysis. In PIONA analysis compounds present in the sample are quantified and grouped into paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, aromatics and oxygenates. The component analysis is presented as a function of carbon number. For the diesel fraction the amount of aromatics and polar compounds was determined. Table 5. Hydrotreatment product yields.ProductYield, wt-%Water31Gas phase35CO2 (CO)11C1-C47C5-C916Liquid phase35Gasoline7Diesel17Heavier11 Unreacted LA present in the HDO feed was partly converted to pentane and this is seen in the relatively high C5-C9 yield in gas phase. Oxygen can be removed as H2O in dehydration and HDO reactions, and as CO2 in decarboxylation reactions. The amount of oxygen removed (40 wt-%) corresponds well with the oxygen content in LA (41 wt-%). The PIONA analysis of the gasoline fraction showed that it contained 37.4 wt-% paraffins (mainly iso-paraffins), 58.2 wt-% naphthenes (mainly paraffinic naphthenes) and 4.1 wt-% aromatics. A small amount of oxygenates (0.2 wt-%) was also observed. The oxygenates were identified to be pentyl ether (0.1 wt-%) and acetone (0.1 wt-%). The compounds of the gasoline fraction are mainly distributed in the C8-C10 range. The carbon content was 85.3 wt-% and hydrogen content 14.6 wt-% corresponding to a molar H/C-ratio of 2.0. The content of aromatics and polar compounds in the diesel fraction was analysed by HPLC method which showed that the diesel contained 37.6 wt-% aromatics and 0.1 wt-% polar compounds. The remainder (62.3 wt-%) of the diesel fraction was aliphatic hydrocarbons. The examples show that it is possible to increase the molecular weight of levulinic acid by C-C-coupling reactions conducted in the presence of a solid acid catalyst system comprising a first metal oxide and a second metal oxide. The examples also show that the C-C-coupling reaction product of levulinic acid can be further processed to hydrocarbons having a boiling point range of typical fuel components such as gasoline and diesel components by subjecting the C-C-coupling reaction product of levulinic acid to hydrodeoxygenation reactions in the presence of a typical HDO catalyst and hydrogen.
