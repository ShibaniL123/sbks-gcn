Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
A solution of sodium nitrite (35 mg, 0.51 mmol) in water (0.20 mL) was added dropwise over 1 minute to a stirred solution of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-3,5-dimethyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (230 mg, 0.51 mmol) in propionic acid (2 mL) at approximately −20° C. (ice-NaCl bath). After 15 minutes the reaction was diluted with ice-cold EtOAc (15 mL). The biphasic mixture was stirred vigorously under these conditions and neutralized by the slow addition of solid Na2CO3 (until basic as measured using a pH strip). The cooling bath was removed. The phases were separated, and the organic layer washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2×15 mL), saturated aqueous sodium chloride (15 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 5 to 35% EtOAc in hexanes. Product fractions were concentrated to dryness to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (104 mg, 45%) as a pale orange film.
