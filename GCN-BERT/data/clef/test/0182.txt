Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method for treating inflammatory or degenerative diseases by administering to an individual a pharmaceutically effective amount of a mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix. 2. Description of the Related Art Inflammation is a biological defense reaction against infection caused by external sources such as external physical and chemical stimuli, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and all sorts of allergens. The inflammatory response is part of innate immune responses, and as in other animals, the human innate immune responses begin when macrophages recognize patterns which present specifically on the cellular surface of pathogens as non-self and attack the pathogens. During the inflammatory response, blood plasma accumulate around the inflammatory site to dilute toxic products released by bacteria, blood stream increases, and symptoms such as erythema, pain, edema, fever and the like are involved. These inflammatory responses involve various biochemical phenomena, and in particular, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) which is related to prostaglandin biosynthesis are known to be important mediators of inflammatory responses. Among them, COX-1 is involved in the production of prostaglandin products (hereinafter referred to as “PG”) in the inflammatory site as well as in various normal organs and tissues of the human body, i.e. gastrointestinal tract or kidney and the like. In comparison, COX-2 is known to be an enzyme which functions only at sites of inflammation. It has been known that commercially available nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (referred to as “NSAIDs”) such as diclofenac, aspirin and ibuprofen, inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 at the same time or primarily COX-1, and thus, they inhibit PG not only in tissues with inflammation, when administered for long periods, but also inhibit PG that are essential for function maintenance in other tissues such as liver, gastrointestinal tract, or kidney at the same time, causing numerous adverse effects (Isselbcher et al., Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, (13th ed)2, pp1543-1711). According to Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the years 1998 and 2001, arthritis was a chronic disease being common among adults aged 45 years or older, and the prevalence rate of arthritis increased with age, and in 65 years and over population, it accounted for 356.7 persons per one thousand people in 1998 and 364.2 persons per one thousand people in 2001 (Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Seoul, Korea, p 51). According to the recent “Senior Statistical Reports, 2010”, the ratio of Korean 65 years and over population is 11%, and the prevalence rate of chronic degenerative diseases increases along with the ageing of population structure, and the chronic disease of high annual prevalence rate is arthritis which accounts for 43.1% or more (Senior Statistical Reports, 2010, The Statistics Korea, Daejeon, Korea, p 5). Arthritis refers to joint inflammation, often involves pain, stiffness and edema, and its causes are degenerative changes, abnormality of immune system, infection, wound, disturbances of metabolism, etc., and there are more than one hundred kinds (Garner B C et al., 2011, Using animal models in osteoarthritis biomarker research, J Knee Surg 24: 251-264). Among them, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) account for 80% of the entire arthritis, and make up the largest part of burden caused by musculoskeletal diseases. When dividing factors associated with the onset of osteoarthritis into large groups, proteolytic enzymes, cytokines, and nitric oxide (NO) are known to be main factors (Wu W et al., 2010, Therapeutic effect of the saponin fraction from Clematis chinensis Osbeck roots on osteoarthritis induced by monosodium iodoacetate through protecting articular cartilage. Phytother Res 24: 538-546; Wesche-Soldato D E et al., 2007, The apoptotic pathway as a therapeutic target in sepsis, Curr Drug Targets 8: 493-500; Herrington C et al., 2008, Molecular and cellular themes in inflammation and immunology, J Pathol 214: 123-125; Campo G M et al., 2009, Glycosaminoglycans modulate inflammation and apoptosis in LPS-treated chondrocytes, J Cell Biochem 160: 83-92). The process of metabolism in cartilage tissues plays a pivotal role in the degeneration of cartilage tissues (Phitak T et al., 2009, The effects of p-hydroxycinnamaldehyde from Alpinia galanga extracts on human chondrocytes, Phytochemistry 7: 237-243), and representatively, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a proteolytic enzyme that destroys matrix components in bone and cartilage, and are expressed also in a pathological condition such as arthritis, and it has been known that MMPs play a major role in etiology (Janusz M J et al., 2001, Moderation of iodoacetate-induced experimental osteoarthritis in rats by matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, Osteoarthritis Cartilage 9: 751-760; Okada A et al., 2009, Progress of research in osteoarthritis, Metalloproteinases in osteoarthritis, Clin Calcium 19: 1593-1601). Upon the onset of arthritis, MMPs of which expression increases are MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-7, and MMP-13, and in particular, it was reported that in cases of MMP-7 and MMP-13, their expression is increased in osteoarthritis (Yoshihara Y et al., 2000, Matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in synovial fluids from patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, Ann Rheum Dis 59: 455-461). Recently, various drugs and treatment methods have been developed and used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, but, the main purpose of treatment is to relieve pain, maintain joint function, and prevent disability caused by dysfunction of joint. Treatment methods of arthritis are being focused on removal of pain by taking a simple analgesic, and when arthritis proceeds further and pain continues, anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs having strong anti-inflammatory effect are used. So far, many drugs having analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects have been developed, and include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac, aspirin, and ibuprofen. However, NSAIDs which are often used for treatment of arthritis have a problem that causes adverse effects to the digestive system, in particular, to a stomach, and this is because NSAIDs inhibit an stomach inner wall protective enzyme, cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), and a pain- and inflammation-causing enzyme, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), at the same time. In addition, long-term use of NSAID can lead to a heartburn or ulcer which eventually causes perforation. Disc pain diseases are an important disease of modern society, costing many billions of dollars of medical finances, and according to United States' National Health Statistics, it has been reported that more than 2% of the population have disc diseases, and five million people show symptoms of spine sprain (Premer, A., S, et, al., 1999; Andersson, G. B., 1999). Also in the South Korea, spine-related pains cause a huge loss in labor force and excessive health expenditure, leading to economic losses. As biochemical changes, IL-1 of cytokines and proteolytic enzymes such as stromelysin and metalloproteinase (MMP) are found in degenerative disc or extruded disc, and IL-1 was assumed to promote synthesis of metalloproteinase, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, etc. in a normal disc and lead to disc degeneration (Kang, J. D., et, al., 1997). Injured discs or discs having degenerative changes become to lose their dynamic function, cause pains, and unlike skin inflammation, edema occur inside, pressure increases and compresses an inflammatory site and its surroundings. In addition, when inflammation occurs, spinal muscles around the lesion become tensed and compress the inflammatory site and its surroundings. This compression acts as a physical stimulus to the lesion, and causes larger inflammation. Accordingly, there is a need to develop natural products and materials which can have excellent efficacy in inflammation, arthritis and disc diseases in human bodies and of which the safety is guaranteed 100 percent. Thus, the present inventors have made an effort to develop natural products having effective anti-inflammatory activity for arthritis or disc disease, and as a result, have found the fact that: a mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall and Glycyrrhizae Radix increased the survival rate of macrophages in vitro, decreased NO production effectively, exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting COX-2, iNOS and MMP expressions, showed nerve cell regenerative and protective effects, exhibited pain-inhibitory effect in vivo, and inhibited arthritis edema and showed clinical pharmacological effect in patients of disc diseases.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail. The present invention provides a method for treating inflammation, arthritis, or disc diseases, comprising administering to an individual a pharmaceutically effective amount of a mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix. The mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix may be prepared by, but not limited to, a preparation method comprising the following steps of: (1) adding an extraction solvent to Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix and extracting extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix; (2) cooling and filtering the extract in step (1); and (3) concentrating the filtered extract in step (2) under reduced pressure and drying the concentrated extract. In the above method, the extraction solvent in step (1) may be water, a lower alcohol of C1 to C2, or a mixture thereof. The lower alcohol may be, but not limited to, ethanol or methanol. The amount of the extraction solvent may be from about 0.1-fold to about 10-fold, preferably from about 0.3-fold to about 5-fold of the amount of dried Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Extraction temperature may be, but not limited to, from about 20 to about 70° C. Extraction time may be, but not limited to, from about 12 to about 48 hr. In the above method, concentration under reduced pressure in step (3) may use, but not limited to, a vacuum reduced pressure concentrator or vacuum rotary evaporator. Drying may be, but not limited to, reduced pressure drying, vacuum drying, boiling drying, spray drying, or freeze drying. The mixed extract may be obtained by mixing Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix and then extracting them, and the respective extracts of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix may be mixed to use, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix may be mixed at a weight ratio of 1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2, respectively, and preferably, at a weight ratio of 1:1.5:1.5:1.5:1.5. The mixed extract could inhibit NO production and could inhibit expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and MMPs. The mixed extract may also have pain-inhibitory, edema-inhibitory, nerve cell regenerative and nerve cell protective effects. The inflammatory response means the occurrence of a series of complex physiological responses such as enzyme activation by various inflammation mediators and immune cells, release of inflammation mediating substances, body fluid infiltration, cell migration, tissue destruction, etc., stimulated by injuries or external materials such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc., and involves symptoms such as erythema, edema, fever and pains. The inflammatory response functions to remove external sources of infection, regenerate injured tissues, and recover functions of organism. However, excessive or continuous inflammatory responses induced by unremoved antigen or internal cause material leads to destruction of mucosa, tissue destruction, and can cause diseases such as cancer, inflammatory skin diseases, inflammatory enteric diseases, arthritis, etc. Arthritis refers to joint inflammation, often involves pain, stiffness and edema, and its causes are degenerative changes, abnormality of immune system, infection, wound, disturbances of metabolism, etc., and there are more than one hundred kinds. Among them, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) account for 80% of the entire arthritis, and make up the largest part of burden caused by musculoskeletal diseases. When dividing factors associated with the onset of osteoarthritis into large groups, proteolytic enzymes, cytokines, and nitric oxide (NO) are known to be main factors. The process of metabolism in cartilage tissues plays a pivotal role in the degeneration of cartilage tissues, and representatively, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a proteolytic enzyme that destroys matrix components in bone and cartilage, and are expressed also in a pathological condition such as arthritis, and it has been known that MMPs play a major role in etiology. Upon the onset of arthritis, MMPs of which expression increases are MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-7, and MMP-13, and in particular, it was reported that in cases of MMP-7 and MMP-13, their expression is increased in osteoarthritis. The arthritis may be, but not limited to, any one selected from the group consisting of osteoarthritis, Rhematoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, and polymyalgia rhematica. In particular examples of the present invention, in order to examine effects of the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix on inflammation, arthritis, and disc diseases, the present inventors prepared the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix. Also, in order to examine cytotoxicity of the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention, the present inventors measured the cell survival rate, and consequently, and consequently, found that the cell survival rate of the cells to which the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix was treated was higher than that of the cells to which the extract in which one or two or more herbs were mixed was treated (see Table 1 and FIG. 1). The present inventors also measured NO production caused by treatment of the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix, and consequently, found that NO production in cells treated with the mixed extract of the present invention decreased effectively, two or more times as much as NO production in cells treated with the extract of one or two or more mixed herbs (see Table 2 and FIG. 2). Also, the present inventors measured COX-2 expression in order to examine the effect of the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention on the expression of an inflammatory cytokine, COX-2, which is a marker for osteoarthritis, in vitro, and consequently, found that COX-2 expression in cells treated with the extract of the present invention was inhibited 2.5 times more effectively than the COX-2 expressions in cells treated with the extract of one or two or more mixed herbs (see FIG. 3). In addition, the present inventors measured iNOS expression in order to examine the effect of the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention on the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), which is a marker for osteoarthritis, and consequently, found that iNOS expression in cells treated with the extract of the present invention was inhibited more effectively than the iNOS expressions in cells treated with the extract of one or two or more mixed herbs (see FIG. 4). Further, the present inventors measured MMP-13 expression in order to examine the effect of the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention on the expression of MMP-13, which is a marker for osteoarthritis, and consequently, found that MMP-13 expression in cells treated with the mixed extract of the present invention was inhibited more remarkably than the MMP-13 expressions in cells treated with the extract of one or two or more mixed herbs (see FIG. 5). The present inventors also measured the number of pains (writhing) (Koster et al., 1959) in order to examine the pain-inhibitory effect of the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention in vivo, and consequently, the number of pains in the group to which the mixed extract of the present invention was administered was smaller than that of the group to which the extract of one or two or more mixed herbs was administered, and similar to the positive control group to which phenylbutazone was administered (see Table 6). In addition, the present inventors measured foot volume of edema-induced white rats in order to examine the arthritis edema-inhibitory effect of the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention in vivo, and calculated edema inhibition rate in order to measure edema increase rate in white rats to which the mixed extract was administered, and consequently, found that edema was induced since 4th day in arthritis edema-induced rats and Zusanli edema in white rats to which the mixed extract was administered was remarkably reduced compared to edema in white rats to which one or two or more mixed herbs was administered (see Table 7). Further, the present inventors measured the cell survival rate in order to examine the nerve cell regenerative effect of the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention, and consequently, found that the cell survival rate of the cells to which the mixed extract of the present invention was treated was at least two times higher than that of the cells to which the extract in which one or two or more herbs were mixed was treated (see FIG. 6). The present inventors also measured LDH release in order to examine the cell membrane damage protective effect of the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention, and consequently, found that LDH release of the cell membrane of the cells to which the extract of the present invention was reduced 1.5 times more than that of the cells to which the extract in which one or two or more herbs were mixed was treated (see FIG. 7). Thus, it was found that the mixed extract of the present invention had nerve cell protective effect. In addition, the present inventors performed MRI in order to examine clinical pharmacological effects of the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention, and consequently, found that different disc symptoms were found from all five patients (see Table 8). Then, after administering the extract for 6 months, the effect of the mixed extract of the present invention on disc patients was examined using MRI. Decrease in extruded disc volume and improvement in the degree of neuromembrane and nerve-root compression were observed (see FIG. 8), absorption of extruded disc and decrease in extruded disc volume were observed (see FIG. 9, FIG. 10, and FIG. 11), and decrease in sequestered disc volume and absorption of the sequestered disc were observed (see FIG. 12). Accordingly, from the experimental result, it was found that the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall and Glycyrrhizae Radix could reduce and absorb effectively the disc volume in disc patients. Thus, the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention increased the survival rate of macrophages in vitro, inhibited the production of NO, which is involved in anti-inflammation, inhibited COX-2, iNOS and MMP expressions, decreased LDH expression to prove nerve cell regenerative and protective effects, inhibited pain and arthritis edema in vivo, and exhibited the disc volume-reducing and absorbing effects in patients of disc diseases.

Edema refers to the condition in which fluid in capillaries escapes from blood vessels and is trapped in the interstitial tissue, the phenomenon in which tissues are expanded due to increased interstitial fluid, and the result of salts and water retention. Edema is observed when interstitial volume increases by at least 2.5 to 3 L. Edema appears often on the face, chest, abdomen, limbs, or whole body, and can be classified into local edema and systemic edema depending on internal distribution. Its causative diseases are renal diseases, heart diseases, liver diseases, some women's diseases (idiopathic edema, edema involved in pregnancy or menstruation), gastrointestinal diseases, endocrine diseases (thyroid disease, adrenal cortex diseases, and diabetes mellitus), lymphedema, skin diseases, etc. Patients having arthritis often experience synovitis, increase in joint fluid, deformation of bone and joint, pains due to joint wear including swollen joints, and walking difficulty due to the surrounding soft tissue swelling-induced compression. When the patient gains body weight due to other diseases, in particular, edema, the pressure applied to joint increases. The arthritis may be, but not limited to, any one selected from the group consisting of osteoarthritis, Rhematoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, and polymyalgia rhematica. Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix may be mixed at a weight ratio of 1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2, respectively, and preferably, at a weight ratio of 1:1.5:1.5:1.5:1.5. The mixed extract may be obtained by using water, a lower alcohol of C1 to C2, or a mixture thereof as a solvent, and the lower alcohol may be ethanol or methanol. Since when the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix was administered to edema-induced white rats, the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention showed 1.5 times higher edema-inhibitory effect than the edema inhibition rate of white rats administered with the extract of one or two or more mixed herbs, the mixed extract of the present invention can be used effectively for the treatment method of inhibiting arthritis edema comprising administering to an individual the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix. The present invention also provides a method of inhibiting inflammation comprising administering to an individual a pharmaceutically effective amount of a mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix. Furthermore, the present invention provides a treatment method for inhibiting pain comprising administering to an individual a pharmaceutically effective amount of a mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix. The present invention also provides a method of inhibiting inflammatory pain comprising administering to an individual a pharmaceutically effective amount of a mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix. Inflammation is a series of syndromes, involving edema, hot sensation, pains, etc., by blood vessel expansion, blood exudation, inflammatory cell migration, sensitization of algesireceptor, etc. In humans, rheumatoid arthritis, bacterial infection, and other inflammatory diseases are known to be important factors in chronic pain sensory. In the process of inflammation response, inflammation-inducible materials (e.g., interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, lipopolysaccharide etc.) promote the expression of an enzyme which produces NO using L-arginine as a substrate, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) being released, and eventually, increase NO production (Brdt et al., 1992; Lafond-Walker et al., 1997; Lowenstein et al., 1994). This NO has been reported to be involved in induction of pain sensation. That is, it was observed that when NO production was inhibited by administering a NOS antagonist, the degree of inflammation was reduced and the accelerated neural activity caused by inflammation was also reduced (Haley et al., 1992; Roche et al., 1996). The above result suggests that NO is involved in inflammation induction as well as pain induction. Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix may be mixed at a weight ratio of 1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2, respectively, and preferably, at a weight ratio of 1:1.5:1.5:1.5:1.5. The mixed extract may be obtained by using water, a lower alcohol of C1 to C2, or a mixture thereof as a solvent, and the lower alcohol may be ethanol or methanol. The mixed extract could inhibit NO production and could inhibit expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and MMPs. The mixed extract may also have pain-inhibitory, edema-inhibitory, nerve cell regenerative and nerve cell protective effects. Thus, since the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention increased the survival rate of macrophages in vitro, inhibited the production of NO, which is involved in anti-inflammation, inhibited COX-2, iNOS and MMP expressions, and inhibited pain and arthritis edema in vivo, it can be used effectively for the method of inhibiting inflammation, pain or inflammatory pain comprising administering to an individual the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix.

In a human body, when a disc between vertebrae, i.e., an intervertebral disc ages, circumferential fissure and radial tear occur in a fibrous ring which surrounds the border of intervertebral disc. At the time, where compression force and twisting force are applied to the spine in an excessively bent state, nucleus pulposus in the middle of the intervertebral disc cannot be surrounded by the fibrous ring and leaks through radial tears, causing so called lumbar herniated intervertebral disc. This condition is generally referred to as disc or degenerative disc disease, and is classified into lumbar disc and cervical disc depending on the part of occurrence. Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix may be mixed at a weight ratio of 1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2:1 to 2, respectively, and preferably, at a weight ratio of 1:1.5:1.5:1.5:1.5. The mixed extract may be obtained by using water, a lower alcohol of C1 to C2, or a mixture thereof as a solvent, and the lower alcohol may be ethanol or methanol. Since decrease in extruded disc volume, improvement in the degree of neuromembrane and nerve-root compression, absorption of extruded disc, decrease in extruded disc volume, decrease in sequestered disc volume and absorption were observed in disc disease patients who administered the mixed extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix, the mixed extract of the present invention can be used effectively for the method for treating disc comprising administering to an individual the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix.

MMPs are a proteolytic enzyme which destroys matrix components in bone and cartilage, and it has been reported that MMPs play a major role in processes such as differentiation of normal tissues, wound healing, organ formation, reproduction, angiogenesis, tissue absorption and remodeling, etc., and are expressed also in a pathological condition such as arthritis, and play a major role in etiology (Patwari P et al., 2003). Accordingly, the following method was performed to examine the effect of the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix on MMP expression. Specifically, in order to examine the effect of the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix prepared by the same method in <Example 1>, cells cultured by the same method in Experimental Example <2-1> were dispensed at a concentration of 5×106 cells into DMEM medium containing 10% FBS in a 6-well plate, and stabilized for 12 hours. The extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix prepared by the method described in <Example 1>, extracts prepared by the methods described in <Comparative Example 1>, <Comparative Example 2>, <Comparative Example 3>, <Comparative Example 4>, <Comparative Example 5>, <Comparative Example 6>, and <Comparative Example 7> were treated along with H2O2 to articular synovial cells for 2 hours, and cells were collected using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, and total RNA was extracted using RNeasy extraction kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, Calif., USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For cDNA synthesis, each of 4 μL of 5× iScript select reaction mix, 2 μL of oligo(dT) primer set (Table 1), 5 μL of RNA sample, 8 μL of nuclease-free water was added to 5 μg of total RNA, and 1 μL of iScript Reverse Transcriptase was added thereto at the end, followed by mixing up and down evenly with a pippet. After performing the reaction at 42° C. for 60 minutes, and at 82° C. for 5 minutes, synthesized cDNA was used for PCR. The machine used for the real-time PCR experiment was Step One Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA) and PCR was performed according to the protocol of iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BIO-RAD). The final concentration of the mixed solution for PCR was 2 μL of cDNA (10 to 100 ng), 10 μL of 2× iQ SYBR Green Supermix, 1 μL of each forward & reverse primer (250 nM), and 7 μL of H2O. PCR analysis was performed as follows: hot start at 95° C. for 10 minutes; 40 cycles of 95° C. for 15 seconds, 55° C. for 15 seconds, and 75° C. for 30 seconds; and a polishing step at 95° C. for 15 seconds. Primers used for the reaction was as described in the following [Table 5]. Experimental results were expressed as mean±S.D. One-way analysis of variance was carried out using Sigma Stat (Jandel Co.; San Rafael, Calif., USA). Differences at *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 were considered statistically significant. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 5, the present inventors treated the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix prepared by the method described in <Example 1> to articular synovial cells in which inflammation was induced by LPS treatment and examined the expression of MMP-13, and found that the expression of MMP-13 was reduced effectively compared to the cells in which extracts in <Comparative Example 1> to <Comparative Example 7> were treated (FIG. 5).

Rats were fed with normal diet and accommodated for 1 week to perform the experiment. Under a 12 hour light/dark cycle, rats had free access to food and water, and bred and maintained under PF (pathogen free) environment at 23±1° C. with relative humidity of 56%. <3-2> Examination of Pain-Inhibitory Effect of Extract of Cibotii Rhizome, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix To examine the pain-inhibitory effect of the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention, the following method was performed. Specifically, the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix prepared by the same method in <Example 1> and extracts prepared by the methods described in <Comparative Example 1> to <Comparative Example 7> were dissolved in physiological saline (1 ml/100 g b.wt.) at a dose of 100 and 300 mg/kg body weight, and were orally administered using a sonde needle. Administration volume was calculated from the bodyweight measured on the day of administration. Control rats were administered only with physiological saline (1 ml/100 g b.wt.). For a positive control group, phenylbutazone was suspended into 0.5% methylcellulose solution at a dose of 50 mg/kg/5 ml to administer orally. After 30 minutes of administration, 0.7% acetic acid-saline (0.1 mg/10 g b.wt.) was injected intraperitoneally, the number of pains (writhing) was measured between 5 to 10 minutes after the injection (Koster et al., 1959). Statistical significance test for each experimental group was performed as follows. Levene's test was performed to examine variance homogeneity of data obtained from each experimental group. If the data showed variance homogeneity, one-was ANOVA was performed, and if the test result was considered to be significant at a level of p=0.05, difference between experimental groups were compared by Dunnett's test (Process 1). If the data showed variance heterogeneity, data transformation was performed, and Levene's test was performed again on the transformed data. If the data showed variance homogeneity, verification was performed according to Process 1. However, if the data showed variance heterogeneity, non-parametric ANOVA test was performed. If the result was significant, statistical significance was verified by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test (Process 2). Consequently, as shown in Table 6, it was found that the number of pains (writhing) measured in the group in which the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix in <Example 1> was administered was smaller than those in the groups in which extracts of <Comparative Example 1> to <Comparative Example 7> were administered, and that the number of pains (writhing) measured in the group in which the extract of the present invention was administered was similar to the positive control group in which phenylbutazone was administered. Accordingly, from the result of Experimental Example <3-2>, it was proved that the extract of the present invention had similar pain-inhibitory effect to phenylbutazone (Table 6).

Specifically, 6 animals per experimental group of white rat (200 g) reared by the method described in Experimental Example <3-1> were selected, and to induce arthritis edema, 0.5 ml of ZYMOSAN-A (20 mg/ml/KG) and 0.5 ml of Freund's adjuvant were mixed and administered to left Zusanli of white rats. The volume of foot was measured using an edema measuring instrument, plethysmometer (Ugo Basile, Italy) and was compared to the volume of foot before administration of the extract of <Example 1> to calculate the edema increase rate (Mathematical formula 1). To edema-induced white rats, the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix prepared by the same method in <Example 1> and extracts prepared by the same methods in <Comparative Example 1> to <Comparative Example 7> were orally administered at 1 ml/1 kg of body weight once a day, repeatedly for 14 days. To compare the edema increase rate between rats administered with different extracts, the edema increase rate was calculated (Mathematical formula 2). [in-line-formulae]Edema increase rate(%)=(foot edema after administration of inflammation inducer−foot edema before administration of inflammation inducer)/foot edema before administration of inflammation inducer×100 [Mathematical formula 1][/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]Edema inhibition rate(%)=(mean edema rate of the control group−mean edema rate of the drug administration group)/mean edema rate of the control group×100 [Mathematical formula 2][/in-line-formulae] Consequently, as shown in Table 7, it was found that edema was induced since 4th day in arthritis edema-induced rats. When comparing the Zusanli edema between rats administered with the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix and rats administered with extracts of <Comparative Example 1> to <Comparative Example 7>, it was found that the edema in rats administered with the extract of the present invention was remarkably reduced (Table 7).

PC12 cells were inoculated to RPMI 1640 medium including 25 mM HEPES, 25 mM sodium bicarbonate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin to culture in an incubator under a condition of 37° C., 5% CO2. <5-2> Examination of Nerve Cell Protective Effect of Extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix To examine whether the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention has nerve cell protective effect or not, the following method was performed. Specifically, to PC12 cells cultured by the method described in Experimental Example <4-1>, the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix prepared by the same method in <Example 1> and extracts prepared by the same methods in <Comparative Example 1> to <Comparative Example 7> were treated, and the cell survival rate was measured. After pre-incubation of PC12 cells with the above extract for 48 hours, incubation with 200 μM H2O2 for 3 hours and incubation with MTT at 37° C. for 3 hours were performed in order, and 100 μL of DMSO was added to stop the reaction. Absorption was measured at 570 nm (determination) and 690 nm (reference wave) using a microplate reader (680, Bio-rad, Tokyo, Japan). PC12 cells were pre-incubated with different concentrations of extracts for 48 hours, and then treated with 200 μM H2O2, and incubated for 3 hours. Centrifugation at 250×g for 5 minutes was performed to precipitate, and 100 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a new well, and the PC12 cellular membrane damage protective effect was measured by LDH assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.). Consequently, as shown in FIG. 6, it was found that the cell survival rate of the PC12 cells to which the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix prepared by the method described in <Example 1> was treated was higher than that of the PC12 cells to which extracts prepared by the same method in <Comparative Example 1> to <Comparative Example 7> were treated (FIG. 6). Also, as shown in FIG. 7, when PC12 cells were treated with H2O2 only, it was found that cell membrane was considerably damaged as LDH release increased. When comparing LDH release between cell membranes in which the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of <Example 1> was treated and cell membranes in which extracts prepared by the same method in <Comparative Example 1> to <Comparative Example 7> were treated, it was found that LDH release in cell membranes in which the extract of <Example 1> was treated was remarkably reduced (FIG. 7). Accordingly, from the result of Experimental Example <4-2>, it was confirmed that the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix of the present invention had nerve cell protective effect.

Informed consent was obtained from every participant via Jaseng Medical Foundation Spine and Joint Research Institute (JSR), and this research was approved by JSR research ethics committee. <6-2> Examination of Effect of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix on Disc Patients To examine clinical pharmacological effects by administering to disc patients recruited by the method described in Experimental Example <6-1> the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix prepared by the method described in <Example 1>, the following method was performed. Specifically, MRI was performed to classify the detailed etiology of disc patients (5 patients) recruited by the method described in Experimental Example <6-1>. As shown in the following [Table 8], different disc symptoms were found from all five patients (Table 8). Then, the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix prepared by the method described in <Example 1> was administered to disc patients twice, 975.32 mg dose each, for 6 months. MRI was performed to examine the effect of the extract of Cibotii Rhizoma, Ledebouriellae Radix, Achyranthis Radix, Paeonia lactiflora Pall, and Glycyrrhizae Radix on disc patients.
