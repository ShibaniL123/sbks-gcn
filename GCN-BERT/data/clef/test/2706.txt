FUNGICIDAL CARBOXAMIDES FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to certain fungicidal amides, their //-oxides, salts and compositions, and methods of their use as fungicides. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The control of plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency. Plant disease damage to ornamental, vegetable, field, cereal, and fruit crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds which are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different sites of action.

More particularly, this invention pertains to a compound of Formula 1 (including all stereoisomers), an Ν-oxide or a salt thereof. This invention also relates to a fungicidal composition comprising (a) a compound of the invention (i.e. in a fungicidally effective amount); and (b) at least one additional component selected from the group consisting of surfactants, solid diluents and liquid diluents. This invention also relates to a fungicidal composition comprising (a) a compound of the invention; and (b) at least one other fungicide (e.g., at least one other fungicide having a different site of action). This invention further relates to a method for controlling plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens comprising applying to the plant or portion thereof, or to the plant seed, a fungicidally effective amount of a compound of the invention (e.g., as a composition described herein). DETAILS OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes,” “including,” “has,” “having,” “contains”, “containing,” “characterized by” or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion, subject to any limitation explicitly indicated. For example, a composition, mixture, process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such composition, mixture, process, method, article, or apparatus. The transitional phrase “consisting of’ excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified. If in the claim, such would close the claim to the inclusion of materials other than those recited except for impurities ordinarily associated therewith. When the phrase “consisting of’ appears in a clause of the body of a claim, rather than immediately following the preamble, it limits only the element set forth in that clause; other elements are not excluded from the claim as a whole. The transitional phrase “consisting essentially of’ is used to define a composition, method or apparatus that includes materials, steps, features, components, or elements, in addition to those literally disclosed, provided that these additional materials, steps, features, components, or elements do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. The term “consisting essentially of’ occupies a middle ground between “comprising” and “consisting of’. Where applicants have defined an invention or a portion thereof with an open-ended term such as “comprising,” it should be readily understood that (unless otherwise stated) the description should be interpreted to also describe such an invention using the terms “consisting essentially of’ or “consisting of.” Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, “or” refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or Β is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and Β is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and Β is true (or present), and both A and Β are true (or present). Also, the indefinite articles “a” and “an” preceding an element or component of the invention are intended to be nonrestrictive regarding the number of instances (i.e. occurrences) of the element or component. Therefore “a” or “an” should be read to include one or at least one, and the singular word form of the element or component also includes the plural unless the number is obviously meant to be singular. As referred to in the present disclosure and claims, “plant” includes members of Kingdom Plantae, particularly seed plants (Spermatopsida), at all life stages, including young plants (e.g., germinating seeds developing into seedlings) and mature, reproductive stages (e.g., plants producing flowers and seeds). Portions of plants include geotropic members typically growing beneath the surface of the growing medium (e.g., soil), such as roots, tubers, bulbs and corms, and also members growing above the growing medium, such as foliage (including stems and leaves), flowers, fruits and seeds. As referred to herein, the term “seedling”, used either alone or in a combination of words means a young plant developing from the embryo of a seed. In the context of this disclosure, plant disease control refers to protecting plants preventatively and/or curatively from diseases caused by pathogens. As referred to in this disclosure, the terms “fungal pathogen” and “fungal plant pathogen” include pathogens in the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota phyla, and the fungal-like Oomycota class that are the causal agents of a broad spectrum of plant diseases of economic importance, affecting ornamental, turf, vegetable, field, cereal and fruit crops. In the context of this disclosure, “protecting a plant from disease” or “control of a plant disease” includes preventative action (interruption of the fungal cycle of infection, colonization, symptom development and spore production) and/or curative action (inhibition of colonization of plant host tissues). As referred to in this disclosure, the term mode of action (ΜΟΑ) is as defined broadly by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC), and is used to distinguish fungicide groups according to their biochemical mode of action in the biosynthetic pathways of plant pathogens. These FRAC-defined MO As are (A) nucleic acid synthesis, (Β) mitosis and cell division, (C) respiration, (D) amino acid and protein synthesis, (Ε) signal transduction, (F) lipid synthesis and membrane integrity, (G) sterol biosynthesis in membranes, (Η) cell wall biosynthesis in membranes, (I) melanin synthesis in cell wall, (Ρ) host plant defense induction, multi-site contact activity and unknown mode of action. Each ΜΟΑ class consists of one or more groups based either on individual validated target sites of action, or in cases where the precise target site is unknown, based on cross resistance profiles within a group or in relation to other groups. Each of these groupings within a FRAC-defined MO A, whether the target site is known or unknown, is designated by a FRAC code. Additional information on target sites and FRAC codes can be obtained from publicly available databases maintained, for example, by FRAC. As referred to in this disclosure, the term “cross resistance” refers to a phenomenon wherein a pathogen evolves resistance to one fungicide and in addition acquires resistance to others. These additional fungicides are typically, but not always, in the same chemical class or have the same target site of action, or can be detoxified by the same mechanism. In the above recitations, the term “alkyl”, used either alone or in compound words such as “alkylthio” or “haloalkyl” includes straight-chain or branched alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, «-propyl, /-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl or hexyl isomers. “Alkenyl” includes straight-chain or branched alkenes such as ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different butenyl, pentenyl and hexenyl isomers. “Alkenyl” also includes polyenes such as 1,2-propadienyl and 2,4-hexadienyl. “Alkynyl” includes straight-chain or branched alkynes such as ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl and the different butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl isomers. “Alkynyl” also includes moieties comprised of multiple triple bonds such as 2,5-hexadiynyl. “Alkanediyl” denotes a straight-chain or branched alkylene.

Examples of “alkylsulfinyl” include CH3S(0)-, CH3CH2S(0)-, CH3CH2CH2S(0)-, (CH3)2CHS(0)- and the different butylsulfinyl, pentylsulfinyl and hexylsulfinyl isomers. Examples of “alkylsulfonyl” include CH3S(0)2-, CH3CH2S(0)2-, CH3CH2CH2S(0)2-, (CH3)2CHS(0)2-, and the different butylsulfonyl, pentylsulfonyl and hexylsulfonyl isomers. “Alkylthioalkyl” denotes alkylthio substitution on alkyl. Examples of “alkylthioalkyl” include CH3SCH2, CH3SCH2CH2, CH3CH2SCH2, CH3CH2CH2CH2SCH2 and CH3CH2SCH2CH2. “Alkylthioalkoxy” denotes alkylthio substitution on alkoxy. “Alkyldithio” denotes branched or straight-chain alkyldithio moieties. Examples of “alkyldithio” include CH3SS-, CH3CH2SS-, CH3CH2CH2SS-, (CH3)2CHSS- and the different butyldithio and pentyldithio isomers. “Cyanoalkyl” denotes an alkyl group substituted with one cyano group. Examples of “cyanoalkyl” include NCCH2, NCCH2CH2 and Cf^CfhCNlCfb. “Cyanoalkoxy”, “dialkylamino”, “alkenylthio”, “alkenylsulfinyl”, “alkenylsulfonyl”, “alkynylthio”, “alkynylsulfinyl”, “alkynylsulfonyl”, and the like, are defined analogously to the above examples. Examples of “cyanoalkoxy” include CNCfhO and CNCH2CH20. “Cycloalkyl” includes, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. The term “alkylcycloalkyl” denotes alkyl substitution on a cycloalkyl moiety and includes, for example, ethylcyclopropyl, /-propylcyclobutyl, 3-methylcyclopentyl and 4-methylcyclohexyl. The term “cycloalkylalkyl” denotes cycloalkyl substitution on an alkyl moiety. Examples of “cycloalkylalkyl” include cyclopropylmethyl, cyclopentylethyl, and other cycloalkyl moieties bonded to straight-chain or branched alkyl groups. The term “cycloalkoxy” denotes cycloalkyl linked through an oxygen atom such as cyclopentyloxy and cyclohexyloxy. “Cycloalkylalkoxy” denotes cycloalkylalkyl linked through an oxygen atom attached to the alkyl chain. Examples of “cycloalkylalkoxy” include cyclopropylmethoxy, cyclopentylethoxy, and other cycloalkyl moieties bonded to straight-chain or branched alkoxy groups. The term “halogen”, either alone or in compound words such as “haloalkyl”, includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. “Haloalkoxy”, is defined analogously to the term “haloalkyl”. The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the “Cj-Cj” prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 5. For example, C1-C3 alkoxy designates CH3O-, CH3CH2O-, CH3CH2CH20- and (CH3)2CHO-. “Aromatic” indicates that each of the ring atoms is essentially in the same plane and has a /^-orbital perpendicular to the ring plane, and that (4η + 2) π electrons, where η is a positive integer, are associated with the ring to comply with Huckel’s rule. When a fully unsaturated carbocyclic ring satisfies Huckel’s rule, then said ring is also called an “aromatic ring.When a fully unsaturated heterocyclic ring satisfies Huckel’s rule, then said ring is also called a “heteroaromatic ring”The term “nonaromatic heterocyclic ring ” denotes a heterocyclic ring system in which no ring in the ring system is aromatic. The term “optionally substituted” in connection with the heterocyclic rings refers to groups which are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent that does not extinguish the biological activity possessed by the unsubstituted analog. As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated. The term “optionally substituted” is used interchangeably with the phrase “substituted or unsubstituted” or with the term “(un)substituted.” Unless otherwise indicated, an optionally substituted group may have a substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and each substitution is independent of the other. When a compound is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates the number of said substituents can exceed 1, said substituents (when they exceed 1) are independently selected from the group of defined substituents, e.g., (R3)n, η is 0, 1, 2 or 3. When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R2a, then when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted. When a variable group is shown to be optionally attached to a position, for example (R3)n, wherein η may be 0, then hydrogen may be at the position even if not recited in the variable group definition. When one or more positions on a group are said to be “not substituted” or “unsubstituted”, then hydrogen atoms are attached to take up any free valency. As referred to by the present disclosure and claims, an “unsaturated heterocyclic ring” is a heterocyclic ring wherein at least two ring member atoms are linked together by a double bond. Unless otherwise stated, an “unsaturated or partially unsaturated heterocyclic ring” (e.g., substituent Q) may be partially unsaturated or fully unsaturated. The expression “fully unsaturated heterocyclic ring” means a heterocyclic ring of atoms in which the bonds between carbon and/or nitrogen atoms in the ring are single or double bonds according to valence bond theory and furthermore the bonds between carbon and/or nitrogen atoms in the ring include as many double bonds as possible without double bonds being cumulative (i.e. no C=C=C, N=C=C, etc.). The term “partially unsaturated heterocyclic ring” denotes a heterocyclic ring comprising at least one ring member bonded to an adjacent ring member through a double bond and which conceptually potentially accommodates a number of non-cumulated double bonds between adjacent ring members (i.e. in its fully unsaturated counterpart form) greater than the number of double bonds present (i.e. in its partially unsaturated form). In the Summary of the Invention R1 can be inter alia a 4- to 6-membered ring containing ring members selected from carbon atoms, 1 O atom and 1 S atom. This ring is undertood to be a carbocyclic ring and includes a non-carbon ring member selected from 1 O atom or 1 S atom. Examples of a 4-membered ring containing ring members selected from carbon atoms, 1 O atom and 1 S atom include an oxetane ring (i.e. 2-oxetanyl or 3-oxetanyl) or a thietane ring (i.e. 2-thietanyl or 3-thietanyl). Examples of a 5-membered ring containing ring members selected from carbon atoms, 1 O atom and 1 S atom include the various regioisomers or tetrahydrofuran or tetrahydrothiophene. Examples of a 6-membered ring containing ring members selected from carbon atoms, 1 O atom and 1 S atom include the various regioisomers of pyran and thiopyran. Note that the attachment point of these rings to the remainder of a Formula 1 can be through any available carbon atom with free valency. In the Summary of the Invention the unsaturated heterocyclic ring of Q is specified to be 5-membered, with ring members selected from carbon atoms and up to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from up to 1 O, up to 1 S and up to 4 Ν atoms, wherein up to 2 carbon atoms are independently selected from C(=0). The heterocyclic ring is optionally substituted with one substituent on a ring member distal relative to the ring member connecting the heteroaromatic ring to the remainder of Formula 1. As depicted in Exhibit 1, the five-membered heterocyclic ring of Q, a ring member distal relative to the ring member connecting the ring to the remainder of Formula 1 is linked through two ring bonds to connecting ring member. The heterocyclic ring of Q is further optionally substituted with substituents selected from R12c on carbon atom ring members and R12n on nitrogen atom ring members. Exhibit 1 Optional R12c substitution on Q ring of Formula 1 ring member connecting Q ring to meta or para position of ring G of Formula 1 Certain heterocycles forming Q may have two distal ring members available for substitution. In this situation, only one of the distal ring members may be substituted with r12c or R12η· the other distal ring member may be substituted with R13c or R13n. If neither of the distal ring members of a heterocycle forming Q are available for substitution, then any additional substituents on the heterocycle are selected from R13c or R13n. If a distal ring member can have two substituents, one substituent may be selected from R12c or R12n and the other substituent may be selected from R13c or R13n. In other words, the Q ring is limited to one R12c or R12n substituent and this substituent must be bonded to a distal ring member; the Q ring can otherwise be further substituted with R13c or R13n on any available ring member. If an attachment point on a group (e.g., ring) is depicted as floating (e.g., as illustrated by the 5-membered unsaturated or partially saturated heterocyclic rings Q-l through Q-21 in Exhibit 3), the group can be attached to the remainder of Formula 1 through any available carbon or nitrogen of the group by replacement of a hydrogen atom. If the attachment point of a substituent on a group (e.g., ring) is depicted as floating (e.g., as illustrated for R12 and R13 on the 5-membered unsaturated heterocyclic rings Q-l through Q-21 in Exhibit 3 of Embodiment 54), the substituent can be attached to any available carbon or nitrogen atom by replacing a hydrogen atom. In the Summary of the Invention G can be phenyl, pyridinyl, pyridazinyl or pyrazinyl substituted with Q meta or para to the -C(R2a)R2b- radical, and optionally substituted with up to 3 substituents selected from R3. Examples of phenyl, pyridinyl, pyridazinyl or pyrazinyl are shown in Exhibit 2. A wide variety of synthetic methods are known in the art to enable preparation of aromatic and nonaromatic heterocyclic rings and ring systems; for extensive reviews see the eight volume set of Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, A. R. Katritzky and C. W. Rees editors-in-chief, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1984 and the twelve volume set of Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II, A. R. Katritzky, C. W. Rees and Ε. F. V. Scriven editors-in-chief, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1996. Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. Stereoisomers are isomers of identical constitution but differing in the arrangement of their atoms in space and include enantiomers, diastereomers, cis-trans isomers (also known as geometric isomers) and atropisomers. Atropisomers result from restricted rotation about single bonds where the rotational barrier is high enough to permit isolation of the isomeric species. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. For a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of stereoisomerism, see Ernest L. Eliel and Samuel Η. Wilen, Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, John Wiley & Sons, 1994. This invention comprises all stereoisomers, conformational isomers and mixtures thereof in all proportions as well as isotopic forms such as deuterated compounds. The compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, or individual stereoisomers. For example, when R2a and R2^ not the same, then Formula 1 possesses a chiral center at the carbon atom to which R2a and R2^ are bonded. The two enantiomers are depicted as Formula 1' and Formula 1" with the chiral center identified with an asterisk (*). Molecular depictions drawn herein follow standard conventions for depicting stereochemistry. To indicate stereoconfiguration, bonds rising from the plane of the drawing and towards the viewer are denoted by solid wedges wherein the broad end of the wedge is attached to the atom rising from the plane of the drawing towards the viewer. Bonds going below the plane of the drawing and away from the viewer are denoted by dashed wedges wherein the narrow end of the wedge is attached to the atom further away from the viewer. Constant width lines indicate bonds with a direction opposite or neutral relative to bonds shown with solid or dashed wedges; constant width lines also depict bonds in molecules or parts of molecules in which no particular stereoconfiguration is intended to be specified. This invention comprises racemic mixtures, for example, equal amounts of the enantiomers of Formulae 1' and 1". In addition, this invention includes compounds that are enriched compared to the racemic mixture in an enantiomer of Formula 1. Also included are the essentially pure enantiomers of compounds of Formula 1, for example, Formula 1' and Formula 1". When enantiomerically enriched, one enantiomer is present in greater amounts than the other, and the extent of enrichment can be defined by an expression of enantiomeric excess (“ee”), which is defined as (2χ-1)·100 %, where χ is the mole fraction of the dominant enantiomer in the mixture (e.g., an ee of 20 % corresponds to a 60:40 ratio of enantiomers). Preferably the compositions of this invention have at least a 50 % enantiomeric excess; more preferably at least a 75 % enantiomeric excess; still more preferably at least a 90 % enantiomeric excess; and the most preferably at least a 94 % enantiomeric excess of the more active isomer. Of particular note are enantiomerically pure embodiments of the more active isomer. Compounds of Formula 1 can comprise additional chiral centers. For example, substituents and other molecular constituents such as R1 may themselves contain chiral centers. This invention comprises racemic mixtures as well as enriched and essentially pure stereoconfigurations at these additional chiral centers. Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more conformational isomers due to restricted rotation about the amide bond (e.g., AC(=Z)-N) in Formula 1. This invention comprises mixtures of conformational isomers. In addition, this invention includes compounds that are enriched in one conformer relative to others. One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen containing heterocycles can form /V-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen-containing heterocycles which can form /V-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form /V-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of /V-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as /-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethyldioxirane. These methods for the preparation of A-oxidcs have been extensively described and reviewed in the literature, see for example: Τ. L. Gilchrist in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, vol. 7, ρρ 748-750, S. V. Ley, Ed., Pergamon Press; Μ. Tisler and Β. Stanovnik in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 3, ρρ 18-20, A. J. Boulton and A. McKillop, Eds., Pergamon Press; Μ. R. Grimmett and Β. R. Τ. Keene in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 43, ρρ 149-161, A. R. Katritzky, Ed., Academic Press; Μ. Tisler and Β. Stanovnik in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 9, ρρ 285-291, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press; and G. W. Η. Cheeseman and Ε. S. G. Werstiuk in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 22, ρρ 390-392, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press. One skilled in the art recognizes that because in the environment and under physiological conditions salts of chemical compounds are in equilibrium with their corresponding nonsalt forms, salts share the biological utility of the nonsalt forms. Thus a wide variety of salts of the compounds of Formula 1 are useful for control of plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens (i.e. are agriculturally suitable). The salts of the compounds of Formula 1 include acid-addition salts with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or valeric acids. When a compound of Formula 1 contains an acidic moiety such as a carboxylic acid or phenol, salts also include those formed with organic or inorganic bases such as pyridine, triethylamine or ammonia, or amides, hydrides, hydroxides or carbonates of sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium or barium. Accordingly, the present invention comprises compounds selected from Formula 1, A-oxidcs and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. Compounds selected from Formula 1, stereoisomers, tautomers, //-oxides, and salts thereof, typically exist in more than one form, and Formula 1 thus includes all crystalline and non-crystalline forms of the compounds that Formula 1 represents. Non-crystalline forms include embodiments which are solids such as waxes and gums as well as embodiments which are liquids such as solutions and melts. Crystalline forms include embodiments which represent essentially a single crystal type and embodiments which represent a mixture of polymorphs (i.e. different crystalline types). The term “polymorph” refers to a particular crystalline form of a chemical compound that can crystallize in different crystalline forms, these forms having different arrangements and/or conformations of the molecules in the crystal lattice. Although polymorphs can have the same chemical composition, they can also differ in composition due to the presence or absence of cocrystallized water or other molecules, which can be weakly or strongly bound in the lattice. Polymorphs can differ in such chemical, physical and biological properties as crystal shape, density, hardness, color, chemical stability, melting point, hygroscopicity, suspensibility, dissolution rate and biological availability. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a polymorph of a compound represented by Formula 1 can exhibit beneficial effects (e.g., suitability for preparation of useful formulations, improved biological performance) relative to another polymorph or a mixture of polymorphs of the same compound represented by Formula 1. Preparation and isolation of a particular polymorph of a compound represented by Formula 1 can be achieved by methods known to those skilled in the art including, for example, crystallization using selected solvents and temperatures. For a comprehensive discussion of polymorphism see R. Hilfiker, Ed., Polymorphism in the Pharmaceutical Industry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2006.

A compound of Formula 19 may be prepared by treatment of a compound of Formula 18 with a base such as potassium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, sodium hydride or ammonium acetate and an electrophilic fluorinating reagent such as Selectfluor™ (l-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-l,4-diazoniabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane bis(tetrafluoroborate)) in solvents such as Ν,Ν-άΐ methyl formamidc, acetonitrile, dichloromethane or methanol at temperatures around 0 °C to ambient temperature. One skilled in the art will recognize that these conditions may be modulated to obtain the monofluorinated product (i.e. a compound of Formula 19 wherein R53 is Η) or the di-fluorinated product (i.e. a compound of Formula 19 wherein R53 is F). In cases where product mixtures are produced, the desired product may be isolated using separation techniques well known in the art. For representative conditions see Tetrahedron Letters 2005, 46, 4905 and Tetrahedron Letters 2006, 47, 4519. An amino compound of Formula 9b may be prepared via the reduction of a nitro compound of Formula 19 using Fe, Ζη, or tin(II) chloride in aqueous acidic media at temperatures ranging from ambient temperature to reflux. Alcohol co-solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol may also be employed. Acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and acetic, or ammonium chloride, are typically employed. Conditions for such reductions may be found in ./ Med. Chern. 2012, 55(3), 1021. Alternatively, hydrogenation conditions such as the use of Raney nickel under an atmosphere of hydrogen may be utilized to prepare a compound of Formula 9b. This type of hydrogenation is typically conducted in a solvent such as ethanol. For representative conditions, see US2012/259111. A compound of Formula 17 is commercially available or may readily be prepared by methods described in the literature.

In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis (see, for example, Greene, Τ. W.; Wuts, Ρ. G. Μ. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991). One skilled in the art will recognize that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted in any individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described in detail to complete the synthesis of compounds of Formula 1. One skilled in the art will also recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the above schemes in an order other than that implied by the particular sequence presented to prepare the compounds of Formula 1. One skilled in the art will also recognize that compounds of Formula 1 and the intermediates described herein can be subjected to various electrophilic, nucleophilic, radical, organometallic, oxidation, and reduction reactions to add substituents or modify existing substituents.

F ormulation/Utility A compound of Formula 1 of this invention (including A-oxidcs and salts thereof) will generally be used as a fungicidal active ingredient in a composition, i.e. formulation, with at least one additional component selected from the group consisting of surfactants, solid diluents and liquid diluents, which serve as a carrier. The formulation or composition ingredients are selected to be consistent with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental factors such as soil type, moisture and temperature. Useful formulations include both liquid and solid compositions. Liquid compositions include solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions, emulsions (including microemulsions, oil-in-water emulsions, flowable concentrates and/or suspoemulsions) and the like, which optionally can be thickened into gels. The general types of aqueous liquid compositions are soluble concentrate, suspension concentrate, capsule suspension, concentrated emulsion, microemulsion, oil-in-water emulsion, flowable concentrate and suspo-emulsion. The general types of nonaqueous liquid compositions are emulsifiable concentrate, microemulsifiable concentrate, dispersible concentrate and oil dispersion. The general types of solid compositions are dusts, powders, granules, pellets, prills, pastilles, tablets, filled films (including seed coatings) and the like, which can be water-dispersible (“wettable”) or water-soluble. Films and coatings formed from filmforming solutions or flowable suspensions are particularly useful for seed treatment. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active ingredient can be encapsulated (or “overcoated”). Encapsulation can control or delay release of the active ingredient. An emulsifiable granule combines the advantages of both an emulsifiable concentrate formulation and a dry granular formulation. High-strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. Sprayable formulations are typically extended in a suitable medium before spraying. Such liquid and solid formulations are formulated to be readily diluted in the spray medium, usually water, but occasionally another suitable medium like an aromatic or paraffinic hydrocarbon or vegetable oil. Spray volumes can range from about one to several thousand liters per hectare, but more typically are in the range from about ten to several hundred liters per hectare. Sprayable formulations can be tank mixed with water or another suitable medium for foliar treatment by aerial or ground application, or for application to the growing medium of the plant. Liquid and dry formulations can be metered directly into drip irrigation systems or metered into the furrow during planting. Liquid and solid formulations can be applied onto seeds of crops and other desirable vegetation as seed treatments before planting to protect developing roots and other subterranean plant parts and/or foliage through systemic uptake. The formulations will typically contain effective amounts of active ingredient, diluent and surfactant within the following approximate ranges which add up to 100 percent by weight. Active Ingredient Diluent Surfactant Water-Dispersible and Water-soluble Granules, Tablets and Powders 0.001-90 0-99.999 0-15 Oil Dispersions, Suspensions, Emulsions, Solutions (including Emulsifiable Concentrates) 1-50 40-99 0-50 Dusts 1-25 70-99 0-5 Granules and Pellets 0.001-95 5-99.999 0-15 High Strength Compositions 90-99 0-10 0-2 Weight Percent Solid diluents include, for example, clays such as bentonite, montmorillonite, attapulgite and kaolin, gypsum, cellulose, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, starch, dextrin, sugars (e.g., lactose, sucrose), silica, talc, mica, diatomaceous earth, urea, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, and sodium sulfate. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins et ah, Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers, 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey. Liquid diluents include, for example, water, AYY-dimcthylalkanamidcs (e.g., Ν, Wdimcthylformamidc), limonene, dimethyl sulfoxide, A-alkyl pyrrol idoncs (e.g., A-mcthyl pyrrol idi none), alkyl phosphates (e.g., triethyl phosphate), ethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, paraffins (e.g., white mineral oils, normal paraffins, isoparaffins), alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, glycerine, glycerol triacetate, sorbitol, aromatic hydrocarbons, dearomatized aliphatics, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, ketones such as cyclohexanone, 2-heptanone, isophorone and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, acetates such as isoamyl acetate, hexyl acetate, heptyl acetate, octyl acetate, nonyl acetate, tridecyl acetate and isobomyl acetate, other esters such as alkylated lactate esters, dibasic esters, alkyl and aryl benzoates and y-butyrolactone, and alcohols, which can be linear, branched, saturated or unsaturated, such as methanol, ethanol, /7-propanol, isopropyl alcohol, /7-butanol, isobutyl alcohol, /7-hcxanol, 2-ethylhexanol, /7-octanol, decanol, isodecyl alcohol, isooctadecanol, cetyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, tridecyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, diacetone alcohol, cresol and benzyl alcohol. Liquid diluents also include glycerol esters of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (typically C6-C22), such as plant seed and fruit oils (e.g., oils of olive, castor, linseed, sesame, com (maize), peanut, sunflower, grapeseed, safflower, cottonseed, soybean, rapeseed, coconut and palm kernel), animal-sourced fats (e.g., beef tallow, pork tallow, lard, cod liver oil, fish oil), and mixtures thereof. Liquid diluents also include alkylated fatty acids (e.g., methylated, ethylated, butylated) wherein the fatty acids may be obtained by hydrolysis of glycerol esters from plant and animal sources, and can be purified by distillation. Typical liquid diluents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. The solid and liquid compositions of the present invention often include one or more surfactants. When added to a liquid, surfactants (also known as “surface-active agents”) generally modify, most often reduce, the surface tension of the liquid. Depending on the nature of the hydrophilic and lipophilic groups in a surfactant molecule, surfactants can be useful as wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers or defoaming agents. Surfactants can be classified as nonionic, anionic or cationic. Nonionic surfactants useful for the present compositions include, but are not limited to: alcohol alkoxylates such as alcohol alkoxylates based on natural and synthetic alcohols (which may be branched or linear) and prepared from the alcohols and ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof; amine ethoxylates, alkanolamides and ethoxylated alkanolamides; alkoxylated triglycerides such as ethoxylated soybean, castor and rapeseed oils; alkylphenol alkoxylates such as octylphenol ethoxylates, nonylphenol ethoxylates, dinonyl phenol ethoxylates and dodecyl phenol ethoxylates (prepared from the phenols and ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof); block polymers prepared from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide and reverse block polymers where the terminal blocks are prepared from propylene oxide; ethoxylated fatty acids; ethoxylated fatty esters and oils; ethoxylated methyl esters; ethoxylated tristyrylphenol (including those prepared from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof); fatty acid esters, glycerol esters, lanolin-based derivatives, polyethoxylate esters such as polyethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyethoxylated sorbitol fatty acid esters and polyethoxylated glycerol fatty acid esters; other sorbitan derivatives such as sorbitan esters; polymeric surfactants such as random copolymers, block copolymers, alkyd peg (polyethylene glycol) resins, graft or comb polymers and star polymers; polyethylene glycols (pegs); polyethylene glycol fatty acid esters; silicone-based surfactants; and sugar-derivatives such as sucrose esters, alkyl polyglycosides and alkyl polysaccharides. Useful anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to: alkylaryl sulfonic acids and their salts; carboxylated alcohol or alkylphenol ethoxylates; diphenyl sulfonate derivatives; lignin and lignin derivatives such as lignosulfonates; maleic or succinic acids or their anhydrides; olefin sulfonates; phosphate esters such as phosphate esters of alcohol alkoxylates, phosphate esters of alkylphenol alkoxylates and phosphate esters of styryl phenol ethoxylates; protein-based surfactants; sarcosine derivatives; styryl phenol ether sulfate; sulfates and sulfonates of oils and fatty acids; sulfates and sulfonates of ethoxylated alkylphenols; sulfates of alcohols; sulfates of ethoxylated alcohols; sulfonates of amines and amides such as AyY-alkyltauratcs; sulfonates of benzene, cumene, toluene, xylene, and dodecyl and tridecylbenzenes; sulfonates of condensed naphthalenes; sulfonates of naphthalene and alkyl naphthalene; sulfonates of fractionated petroleum; sulfosuccinamates; and sulfosuccinates and their derivatives such as dialkyl sulfosuccinate salts. Useful cationic surfactants include, but are not limited to: amides and ethoxylated amides; amines such as A-alkyl propanediamines, tripropylenetriamines and dipropylenetetramines, and ethoxylated amines, ethoxylated diamines and propoxylated amines (prepared from the amines and ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof); amine salts such as amine acetates and diamine salts; quaternary ammonium salts such as quaternary salts, ethoxylated quaternary salts and diquatemary salts; and amine oxides such as alkyldimethylamine oxides and bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-alkylamine oxides. Also useful for the present compositions are mixtures of nonionic and anionic surfactants or mixtures of nonionic and cationic surfactants. Nonionic, anionic and cationic surfactants and their recommended uses are disclosed in a variety of published references including McCutcheon’s Emulsifiers and Detergents, annual American and International Editions published by McCutcheon’s Division, The Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing Co.; Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chemical Publ. Co., Inc., New York, 1964; and A. S. Davidson and Β. Milwidsky, Synthetic Detergents, Seventh Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1987. Compositions of this invention may also contain formulation auxiliaries and additives, known to those skilled in the art as formulation aids (some of which may be considered to also function as solid diluents, liquid diluents or surfactants). Such formulation auxiliaries and additives may control: pH (buffers), foaming during processing (antifoams such polyorganosiloxanes), sedimentation of active ingredients (suspending agents), viscosity (thixotropic thickeners), in-container microbial growth (antimicrobials), product freezing (antifreezes), color (dyes/pigment dispersions), wash-off (film formers or stickers), evaporation (evaporation retardants), and other formulation attributes. Film formers include, for example, polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl acetate copolymers, polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and waxes. Examples of formulation auxiliaries and additives include those listed in McCutcheon’s Volume 2: Functional Materials, annual International and North American editions published by McCutcheon’s Division, The Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing Co.; and PCT Publication WO 03/024222. The compound of Formula 1 and any other active ingredients are typically incorporated into the present compositions by dissolving the active ingredient in a solvent or by grinding in a liquid or dry diluent. Solutions, including emulsifiable concentrates, can be prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. If the solvent of a liquid composition intended for use as an emulsifiable concentrate is water-immiscible, an emulsifier is typically added to emulsify the active-containing solvent upon dilution with water. Active ingredient slurries, with particle diameters of up to 2,000 pm can be wet milled using media mills to obtain particles with average diameters below 3 pm. Aqueous slurries can be made into finished suspension concentrates (see, for example, U.S. 3,060,084) or further processed by spray drying to form water-dispersible granules. Dry formulations usually require dry milling processes, which produce average particle diameters in the 2 to 10 pm range. Dusts and powders can be prepared by blending and usually grinding (such as with a hammer mill or fluid-energy mill). Granules and pellets can be prepared by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See Browning, “Agglomeration”, Chemical Engineering, December 4, 1967, ρρ 147-48, Perry’s Chemical Engineer’s Handbook, 4th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1963, pages 8-57 and following, and WO 91/13546. Pellets can be prepared as described in U.S. 4,172,714. Water-dispersible and water-soluble granules can be prepared as taught in U.S. 4,144,050, U.S. 3,920,442 and DE 3,246,493. Tablets can be prepared as taught in U.S. 5,180,587, U.S. 5,232,701 and U.S. 5,208,030. Films can be prepared as taught in GB 2,095,558 and U.S. 3,299,566.One embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for controlling fungal pathogens, comprising diluting the fungicidal composition of the present invention (a compound of Formula 1 formulated with surfactants, solid diluents and liquid diluents or a formulated mixture of a compound of Formula 1 and at least one other fungicide) with water, and optionally adding an adjuvant to form a diluted composition, and contacting the fungal pathogen or its environment with an effective amount of said diluted composition. Although a spray composition formed by diluting with water a sufficient concentration of the present fungicidal composition can provide sufficient efficacy for controlling fungal pathogens, separately formulated adjuvant products can also be added to spray tank mixtures. These additional adjuvants are commonly known as “spray adjuvants” or “tankmix adjuvants”, and include any substance mixed in a spray tank to improve the performance of a pesticide or alter the physical properties of the spray mixture. Adjuvants can be anionic or nonionic surfactants, emulsifying agents, petroleum-based crop oils, crop-derived seed oils, acidifiers, buffers, thickeners or defoaming agents. Adjuvants are used to enhancing efficacy (e.g., biological availability, adhesion, penetration, uniformity of coverage and durability of protection), or minimizing or eliminating spray application problems associated with incompatibility, foaming, drift, evaporation, volatilization and degradation. To obtain optimal performance, adjuvants are selected with regard to the properties of the active ingredient, formulation and target (e.g., crops, insect pests). The amount of adjuvants added to spray mixtures is generally in the range of about 2.5% to 0.1 % by volume. The application rates of adjuvants added to spray mixtures are typically between about 1 to 5 L per hectare. Representative examples of spray adjuvants include: Adigor® (Syngenta) 47% methylated rapeseed oil in liquid hydrocarbons, Silwet® (Helena Chemical Company) polyalkyleneoxide modified heptamethyltrisiloxane and Assist® (BASF) 17% surfactant blend in 83% paraffin based mineral oil. One method of seed treatment is by spraying or dusting the seed with a compound of the invention (i.e. as a formulated composition) before sowing the seeds. Compositions formulated for seed treatment generally comprise a film former or adhesive agent. Therefore typically a seed coating composition of the present invention comprises a biologically effective amount of a compound of Formula 1 and a film former or adhesive agent. Seed can be coated by spraying a flowable suspension concentrate directly into a tumbling bed of seeds and then drying the seeds. Alternatively, other formulation types such as wetted powders, solutions, suspoemulsions, emulsifiable concentrates and emulsions in water can be sprayed on the seed. This process is particularly useful for applying film coatings on seeds. Various coating machines and processes are available to one skilled in the art. Suitable processes include those listed in Ρ. Rosters et al., Seed Treatment: Progress and Prospects, 1994 BCPC Mongraph No. 57, and references listed therein. For further information regarding the art of formulation, see Τ. S.

Aqueous compositions for direct applications to the plant or portion thereof (e.g., spray tank compositions) typically contain at least about 1 ppm or more (e.g., from 1 ppm to 100 ppm) of the compound(s) of this invention. Seed is normally treated at a rate of from about 0.001 g (more typically about 0.1 g) to about 10 g per kilogram of seed (i.e. from about 0.0001 to 1% by weight of the seed before treatment). A flowable suspension formulated for seed treatment typically comprises from about 0.5 to about 70% of the active ingredient, from about 0.5 to about 30% of a filmforming adhesive, from about 0.5 to about 20% of a dispersing agent, from 0 to about 5% of a thickener, from 0 to about 5% of a pigment and/or dye, from 0 to about 2% of an antifoaming agent, from 0 to about 1% of a preservative, and from 0 to about 75% of a volatile liquid diluent. The compounds of this invention are useful as plant disease control agents. The present invention therefore further comprises a method for controlling plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens comprising applying to the plant or portion thereof to be protected, or to the plant seed to be protected, an effective amount of a compound of the invention or a fungicidal composition containing said compound. The compounds and/or compositions of this invention provide control of diseases caused by a broad spectrum of fungal plant pathogens in the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota phyla, and the fungal-like Oomycata class. They are effective in controlling a broad spectrum of plant diseases, particularly foliar pathogens of ornamental, turf, vegetable, field, cereal, and fruit crops. These pathogens include but are not limited to those listed in Table 1. For Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes, names for both the sexual/teleomorph/perfect stage as well as names for the asexual/anamorph/imperfect stage (in parentheses) are listed where known. Synonymous names for pathogens are indicated by an equal sign. For example, the sexuaFteleomorph/perfect stage name Phaeosphaeria nodorum is followed by the corresponding asexual/anamorph/imperfect stage name Stagnospora nodorum and the synonymous older name Septoria nodorum.

The compounds of the invention are believed to provide protection from fungal plant pathogens by inhibiting Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) fungal respiration by disrupting a key enzyme in the Krebs Cycle (TCA cycle) named succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). SDH is composed of four nuclear-encoded polypeptides, identified as SDHA, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD. Inhibiting respiration prevents the fungus from making ATP, and thus inhibits growth and reproduction. At the molecular level, carboxamides inhibit ubiquinone reduction by binding to the ubiquinone binding site (Qp site) formed by subunits SDHB, SDHC and SDHD in the SDH enzyme. The Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) has identified chemical compounds having this fungicidal mode of action as “SDHIs” as an abbreviation for succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors and categorized them with FRAC Code 7. A variety of mutations in subunits SDHB, SDHC and SDHD forming the ubiquinone binding site are now known to cause resistance to SDHIs. FRAC has published on their website a “List of fungal species with resistance reports towards SDHI fungicides and mutations in the succinate dehydrogenates gene (updated March 2012)” (http://frac.info/ffac/work/List%20of%20SDHI%20resistant%20species.pdf available as of 28 June 2012), which includes both mutants produced in the laboratory through artificial mutagenesis and naturally occurring mutants found in the field showing resistance to SDHIs. Scalliet et al., “Mutagenesis and Functional Studies with Succinate Dehydrogenase Inhibitors in the Wheat Pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola”, PLoS ONE, 2012, 7 (4), 1-20 (published in Adobe Acrobat file format as joumal.pone.0035429.pdf and available through http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F 10.1371 %2Fjoumal.pone.0035429 on 28 June 2012) describes additional mutants of Mycosphaerella graminicola. These publications disclose fungal pathogens having known resistant mutants include Alternaria alternata (SDHB: Η277Υ, H277R; SDHC: H134R; SDHD: D123E, H133R), Aspergillus oryzae (SDHB: Η249Υ, H249L, Η249Ν; SDHC: T90I; SDHD: D124E), Botrytis cinearea (SDHB: P225L, Ρ225Τ, P225F, Η272Υ, H272R, H272L, N230I; SDHD: H132R), Botrytis elliptica (SDHB: Η272Υ, H272R), Corynespora cassiicola (SDHB: Η287Υ, H287R; SDHC: S73P, SDHD: S89P), Didymella bryoniae (SDHB: H277R, Η277Υ), Mycosphaerella graminicola (SDHB: S218F, Ρ220Τ, P220L, S221P, Ν225Η, N225I, R265P, H267L, Η267Ν, H267R, H267Q, Η267Υ, I269V, Ν271Κ; SDHC: T79I, S83G, A84V, A84I, L85P, Ν86Κ, R87C, V88D, H145R, H152R; SDHD: D129E, D129G, D129S, D129T, Η139Ε), Podosphaera xanthii (SDHB: H[???]Y), Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (SDHD: H132R), Ustilago maydis (SDHB: H257L), Stemphylium botryose (SDHB: P225L, Η272Υ, H272R) and Ustilago maydis (SDHB: H257L), wherein the left letter identifies the amino acid in the prevalent wild-type enzyme subunit, the number specifies the amino acid location in the subunit, and the right letter identifies the amino acid in the mutant subunit (the amino acids are identified by standard single letter codes; see for example http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Biology/aatable.html, accessed 28 June 2012). Because the metabolism of other fungal pathogens, such as Septoria tritici, also involve succinate dehydrogenase, SDHI-resistant mutants are possible for them as well. Remarkably, compounds of the present invention, retain sufficient activity against mutant fungal pathogens highly resistant to other SDHIs, so that the present compounds remain agronomically useful for protecting plants against the mutant as well as wild-type pathogens. The improved efficacy of the present compounds compared to other SDHI fungicides for controlling plant disease caused by the SDHI-resistant fungal pathogens can be determined by simple plant disease control testing, for example tests similar to Tests Α-Ε disclosed herein, but using SDHI-resistant instead of wild-type fungal pathogens. In addition to their fungicidal activity, the compositions or combinations also have activity against bacteria such as Erwinia amylovora, Xanthomonas campestris, Pseudomonas syringae, and other related species. By controlling harmful microorganisms, the compounds of the invention are useful for improving (i.e. increasing) the ratio of beneficial to harmful microorganisms in contact with crop plants or their propagules (e.g., seeds, conns, bulbs, tubers, cuttings) or in the agronomic environment of the crop plants or their propagules. Compounds of the invention are useful in treating all plants, plant parts and seeds. Plant and seed varieties and cultivars can be obtained by conventional propagation and breeding methods or by genetic engineering methods. Genetically modified plants or seeds (transgenic plants or seeds) are those in which a heterologous gene (transgene) has been stably integrated into the plant's or seed’s genome. A transgene that is defined by its particular location in the plant genome is called a transformation or transgenic event. Genetically modified plant cultivars which can be treated according to the invention include those that are resistant against one or more biotic stresses (pests such as nematodes, insects, mites, fungi, etc.) or abiotic stresses (drought, cold temperature, soil salinity, etc.), or that contain other desirable characteristics. Plants can be genetically modified to exhibit traits of, for example, herbicide tolerance, insect-resistance, modified oil profiles or drought tolerance. Useful genetically modified plants containing single gene transformation events or combinations of transformation events are listed in Table 2. Additional information for the genetic modifications listed in Table 2 can be obtained from publicly available databases maintained, for example, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The following abbreviations, Τ1 through Τ37, are used in Table 2 for traits.

For example, reduction in application rates, broadening of the activity spectrum, increased tolerance to biotic/abiotic stresses or enhanced storage stability may be greater than expected from just simple additive effects of the application of compounds of the invention on genetically modified plants and seeds. Compounds of this invention are useful in seed treatments for protecting seeds from plant diseases. In the context of the present disclosure and claims, treating a seed means contacting the seed with a biologically effective amount of a compound of this invention, which is typically formulated as a composition of the invention. This seed treatment protects the seed from soil-borne disease pathogens and generally can also protect roots and other plant parts in contact with the soil of the seedling developing from the germinating seed. The seed treatment may also provide protection of foliage by translocation of the compound of this invention or a second active ingredient within the developing plant. Seed treatments can be applied to all types of seeds, including those from which plants genetically transformed to express specialized traits will germinate. Representative examples include those expressing proteins toxic to invertebrate pests, such as Bacillus thuringiensis toxin or those expressing herbicide resistance such as glyphosate acetyltransferase, which provides resistance to glyphosate. Seed treatments with compounds of this invention can also increase vigor of plants growing from the seed. Compounds of this invention and their compositions, both alone and in combination with other fungicides, nematicides and insecticides, are particularly useful in seed treatment for crops including, but not limited to, maize or com, soybeans, cotton, cereal (e.g., wheat, oats, barley, rye and rice), potatoes, vegetables and oilseed rape. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating postharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables caused by fungi and bacteria. These infections can occur before, during and after harvest. For example, infections can occur before harvest and then remain dormant until some point during ripening (e.g., host begins tissue changes in such a way that infection can progress); also infections can arise from surface wounds created by mechanical or insect injury. In this respect, the compounds of this invention can reduce losses (i.e. losses resulting from quantity and quality) due to postharvest diseases which may occur at any time from harvest to consumption. Treatment of postharvest diseases with compounds of the invention can increase the period of time during which perishable edible plant parts (e.g, fruits, seeds, foliage, stems, bulbs, tubers) can be stored refrigerated or unrefrigerated after harvest, and remain edible and free from noticeable or harmful degradation or contamination by fungi or other microorganisms. Treatment of edible plant parts before or after harvest with compounds of the invention can also decrease the formation of toxic metabolites of fungi or other microorganisms, for example, mycotoxins such as aflatoxins. Plant disease control is ordinarily accomplished by applying an effective amount of a compound of this invention either pre- or post-infection, to the portion of the plant to be protected such as the roots, stems, foliage, fruits, seeds, tubers or bulbs, or to the media (soil or sand) in which the plants to be protected are growing. The compounds can also be applied to seeds to protect the seeds and seedlings developing from the seeds. The compounds can also be applied through irrigation water to treat plants. Control of postharvest pathogens which infect the produce before harvest is typically accomplished by field application of a compound of this invention, and in cases where infection occurs after harvest the compounds can be applied to the harvested crop as dips, sprays, fumigants, treated wraps and box liners. Rates of application for these compounds (i.e. a fungicidally effective amount) can be influenced by factors such as the plant diseases to be controlled, the plant species to be protected, ambient moisture and temperature and should be determined under actual use conditions. One skilled in the art can easily determine through simple experimentation the fungicidally effective amount necessary for the desired level of plant disease control. Foliage can normally be protected when treated at a rate of from less than about 1 g/ha to about 5,000 g/ha of active ingredient. Seed and seedlings can normally be protected when seed is treated at a rate of from about 0.001 g (more typically about 0.1 g) to about 10 g per kilogram of seed. Compounds of this invention can also be mixed with one or more other biologically active compounds or agents including fungicides, insecticides, nematocides, bactericides, acaricides, herbicides, herbicide safeners, growth regulators such as insect molting inhibitors and rooting stimulants, chemosterilants, semiochemicals, repellents, attractants, pheromones, feeding stimulants, plant nutrients, other biologically active compounds or entomopathogenic bacteria, virus or fungi to form a multi-component pesticide giving an even broader spectrum of agricultural protection. Thus the present invention also pertains to a composition comprising a compound of Formula 1 (in a fungicidally effective amount) and at least one additional biologically active compound or agent (in a biologically effective amount) and can further comprise at least one of a surfactant, a solid diluent or a liquid diluent. The other biologically active compounds or agents can be formulated in compositions comprising at least one of a surfactant, solid or liquid diluent. For mixtures of the present invention, one or more other biologically active compounds or agents can be formulated together with a compound of Formula 1, to form a premix, or one or more other biologically active compounds or agents can be formulated separately from the compound of Formula 1, and the formulations combined together before application (e.g., in a spray tank) or, alternatively, applied in succession. As mentioned in the Summary of the Invention, one aspect of the present invention is a fungicidal composition comprising (i.e. a mixture or combination of) a compound of Formula 1, an A-oxide, or a salt thereof (i.e. component a), and at least one other fungicide (i.e. component b). Of note is such a combination where the other fungicidal active ingredient has different site of action from the compound of Formula 1. In certain instances, a combination with at least one other fungicidal active ingredient having a similar spectrum of control but a different site of action will be particularly advantageous for resistance management. Thus, a composition of the present invention can further comprise a fungicidally effective amount of at least one additional fungicidal active ingredient having a similar spectrum of control but a different site of action.

(bl) “Methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC) fungicides” (FRAC code 1) inhibit mitosis by binding to P-tubulin during microtubule assembly. Inhibition of microtubule assembly can disrupt cell division, transport within the cell and cell structure. Methyl benzimidazole carbamate fungicides include benzimidazole and thiophanate fungicides. The benzimidazoles include benomyl, carbendazim, fuberidazole and thiabendazole. The thiophanates include thiophanate and thiophanate-methyl.

(b3) “Demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides” (FRAC code 3) (Sterol Biosynthesis Inhibitors (SBI): Class I) inhibit C14-demethylase, which plays a role in sterol production. Sterols, such as ergosterol, are needed for membrane structure and function, making them essential for the development of functional cell walls. Therefore, exposure to these fungicides results in abnormal growth and eventually death of sensitive fungi. DMI fungicides are divided between several chemical classes: azoles (including triazoles and imidazoles), pyrimidines, piperazines, pyridines and triazolinthiones. The triazoles include azaconazole, bitertanol, bromuconazole, cyproconazole, difenoconazole, diniconazole (including diniconazole-M), epoxiconazole, etaconazole, fenbuconazole, fluquinconazole, flusilazole, flutriafol, hexaconazole, imibenconazole, ipconazole, metconazole, myclobutanil, penconazole, propiconazole, quinconazole, simeconazole, tebuconazole, tetraconazole, triadimefon, triadimenol, triticonazole, uniconazole, uniconazole-P, α-(1-chlorocyclopropyl)-a-[2-(2,2-dichlorocyclopropyl)ethyl]- 1Η-1,2,4-triazole-1 -ethanol, rel-1 [[(2i?,3S)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-oxiranyl]methyl]-l//-l,2,4-triazole, re/-2-[[(2i?,3S)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-oxiranyl]methyl]-l,2-dihydro-3Η-1,2,4-triazolc-3-thionc, and re/-l-[[(2i?,3S)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-oxiranyl]methyl]-5-(2-propen-l-ylthio)-l//-l,2,4-triazole.

Kuck et al. in Modern Selective Fungicides - Properties, Applications and Mechanisms of Action, Η. Lyr (Ed.), Gustav Fischer Verlag: New York, 1995, 205-258. (b4) “Phenylamide fungicides” (FRAC code 4) are specific inhibitors of RNA polymerase in Oomycete fungi. Sensitive fungi exposed to these fungicides show a reduced capacity to incorporate uridine into rRNA. Growth and development in sensitive fungi is prevented by exposure to this class of fungicide.

The acylalanines include benalaxyl, benalaxyl-M (also known as kiralaxyl), furalaxyl, metalaxyl and metalaxyl-M (also known as mefenoxam). The oxazolidinones include oxadixyl. The butyrolactones include ofurace. (b5) “Amine/morpholine fungicides” (FRAC code 5) (SBI: Class II) inhibit two target sites within the sterol biosynthetic pathway, A8-> A7 isomerase and A14 reductase. Sterols, such as ergosterol, are needed for membrane structure and function, making them essential for the development of functional cell walls. Therefore, exposure to these fungicides results in abnormal growth and eventually death of sensitive fungi. Amine/morpholine fungicides (also known as non-DMI sterol biosynthesis inhibitors) include morpholine, piperidine and spiroketal-amine fungicides.

(bll) “Quinone outside inhibitor (Qol) fungicides” (FRAC code 11) inhibit Complex III mitochondrial respiration in fungi by affecting ubiquinol oxidase. Oxidation of ubiquinol is blocked at the “quinone outside” (Q0) site of the cytochrome be \ complex, which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of fungi. Inhibiting mitochondrial respiration prevents normal fungal growth and development. Quinone outside inhibitor fungicides include methoxyacrylate, methoxycarbamate, oximinoacetate, oximinoacetamide and dihydrodioxazine fungicides (collectively also known as strobilurin fungicides), and oxazolidinedione, imidazolinone and benzylcarbamate fungicides.

General references for agricultural protectants (i.e. insecticides, fungicides, nematocides, acaricides, herbicides and biological agents) include The Pesticide Manual, 13th Edition, C. D. S. Tomlin, Ed., British Crop Protection Council, Famham, Surrey, U.K., 2003 and The BioPesticide Manual, 2nd Edition, L. G. Copping, Ed., British Crop Protection Council, Famham, Surrey, U.K., 2001. For embodiments where one or more of these various mixing partners are used, the weight ratio of these various mixing partners (in total) to the compound of Formula 1 is typically between about 1:3000 and about 3000:1. Of note are weight ratios between about 1:300 and about 300:1 (for example ratios between about 1:30 and about 30:1). One skilled in the art can easily determine through simple experimentation the biologically effective amounts of active ingredients necessary for the desired spectrum of biological activity. It will be evident that including these additional components may expand the spectrum of diseases controlled beyond the spectrum controlled by the compound of Formula 1 alone. In certain instances, combinations of a compound of this invention with other biologically active (particularly fungicidal) compounds or agents (i.e. active ingredients) can result in a greater-than-additive (i.e. synergistic) effect. Reducing the quantity of active ingredients released in the environment while ensuring effective pest control is always desirable. When synergism of fungicidal active ingredients occurs at application rates giving agronomically satisfactory levels of fungal control, such combinations can be advantageous for reducing crop production cost and decreasing environmental load. Also in certain instances, combinations of a compound of the invention with other biologically active compounds or agents can result in a less-than-additive (i.e. safening) effect on organisms beneficial to the agronomic environment. For example, a compound of the invention may safen a herbicide on crop plants or protect a beneficial insect species (e.g., insect predators, pollinators such as bees) from an insecticide. Fungicides of note for formulation with compounds of Formula 1 to provide mixtures useful in seed treatment include but are not limited to amisulbrom, azoxystrobin, boscalid, carbendazim, carboxin, cymoxanil, cyproconazole, difenoconazole, dimethomorph, fluazinam, fludioxonil, flufenoxystrobin, fluquinconazole, fluopicolide, fluoxastrobin, flutriafol, fluxapyroxad, ipconazole, iprodione, metalaxyl, mefenoxam, metconazole, myclobutanil, paclobutrazole, penflufen, picoxystrobin, prothioconazole, pyraclostrobin, sedaxane, silthiofam, tebuconazole, thiabendazole, thiophanate-methyl, thiram, trifloxystrobin and triticonazole.

Compositions comprising compounds of Formula 1 useful for seed treatment can further comprise bacteria and fungi that have the ability to provide protection from the harmful effects of plant pathogenic fungi or bacteria and/or soil bom animals such as nematodes. Bacteria exhibiting nematicidal properties may include but are not limited to Bacillus firmus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillius subtiliis and Pasteuria penetrans. A suitable Bacillus firmus strain is strain CNCM 1-1582 (GB-126) which is commercially available as BioNem™. A suitable Bacillus cereus strain is strain NCMM 1-1592. Both Bacillus strains are disclosed in US 6,406,690. Other suitable bacteria exhibiting nematicidal activity are Β. amyloliquefaciens IN937a and Β. subtilis strain GB03. Bacteria exhibiting fungicidal properties may include but are not limited to Β. pumilus strain GB34. Fungal species exhibiting nematicidal properties may include but are not limited to Myrothecium verrucaria, Paecilomyces lilacinus and Purpureocillium lilacinum. Seed treatments can also include one or more nematicidal agents of natural origin such as the elicitor protein called harpin which is isolated from certain bacterial plant pathogens such as Erwinia amylovora. An example is the Harpin-N-Tek seed treatment technology available as N-Hibit™ Gold CST. Seed treatments can also include one or more species of legume-root nodulating bacteria such as the microsymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria Bradyrhizobium japonicum. These inocculants can optionally include one or more lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), which are nodulation (Nod) factors produced by rhizobia bacteria during the initiation of nodule formation on the roots of legumes. For example, the Optimize® brand seed treatment technology incorporates LCO Promoter Technology™ in combination with an inocculant. Seed treatments can also include one or more isoflavones which can increase the level of root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhizal fungi improve plant growth by enhancing the root uptake of nutrients such as water, sulfates, nitrates, phosphates and metals. Examples of isoflavones include, but are not limited to, genistein, biochanin A, formononetin, daidzein, glycitein, hesperetin, naringenin and pratensein. Formononetin is available as an active ingredient in mycorrhizal inocculant products such as PHC Colonize® AG. Seed treatments can also include one or more plant activators that induce systemic acquired resistance in plants following contact by a pathogen. An example of a plant activator which induces such protective mechanisms is acibcnzolar-S-mcthyl. The following Tests demonstrate the control efficacy of compounds of this invention on specific pathogens. The pathogen control protection afforded by the compounds is not limited, however, to these species. See Index Tables Α-Η for compound descriptions. The following abbreviations are used in the Tables which follow: Me means methyl, Et means ethyl, Pr means propyl, z-Pr means isopropyl, z-Pre means isopropenyl, c-Pr means cyclopropyl, ΟΜ℮ means methoxy, TMS means trimethylsilyl, Ph means phenyl, MeOC(=0) means methoxycarbonyl and CN means cyano. Where (R3)n is listed as “H”, this means that η is 0 and the ring comprising G is not substituted with R3. The abbreviation “Ex.” stands for “Example” and is followed by a number indicating in which example the compound is prepared.

Couplings are designated by (s)-singlet, (d)-doublet, (t)-triplet, (m)-multiplet, (dd)-doublet of doublets. BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION General protocol for preparing test suspensions for Tests Α-Ε: the test compounds were first dissolved in acetone in an amount equal to 3 % of the final volume and then suspended at the desired concentration (in ppm) in acetone and purified water (50/50 mix by volume) containing 250 ppm of the surfactant Trem® 014 (polyhydric alcohol esters). The resulting test suspensions were then used in Tests Α-Ε. Samples were applied to plants at either a 10 ppm (**), 40 ppm, 50 ppm (*) or 200 ppm (#) test solution to the point of run-off on the test plants with the equivalent of a rate of 40 g ai/ha, 160 g ai/ha, 200 g ai/ha, or 800 g ai/ha, respectively. TESTA The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on tomato seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Botrytis cinerea (the causal agent of gray mold on many crops) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 °C for 48 h, and moved to a growth chamber at 27 °C for 2 days, after which time visual disease ratings were made. TEST Β The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on wheat seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Stagonospora nodorum (also known as Septoria nodorum; the causal agent of wheat glume blotch) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 °C for 48 h, and then moved to a growth chamber at 20 °C for 6 days, after which time visual disease ratings were made. TEST C The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on wheat seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Septoria tritici (the causal agent of wheat leaf blotch) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 24 °C for 48 h, and then moved to a growth chamber at 20 °C for 21 days, after which time visual disease ratings were made. TEST D The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on wheat seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici; (the causal agent of wheat leaf rust) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 °C for 24 h, and then moved to a growth chamber at 20 °C for 6 days, after which time visual disease ratings were made. TESTE The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on wheat seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore dust of Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici, (the causal agent of wheat powdery mildew) and incubated in a growth chamber at 20 °C for 7 or 8 days, after which time visual disease ratings were made. Results for Tests Α-Ε are given in Table A. In the Table, a rating of 100 indicates 100% disease control and a rating of 0 indicates no disease control (relative to the controls). A dash (-) indicates no test results.
