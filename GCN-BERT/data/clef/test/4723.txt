Process for the manufacture of terphenyl compounds Cross-reference to related applications This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application No. 61/979824 filed on 15 April, 2014 and to European application No. 14167125.5 filed on 06 May, 2014, the whole content of each of these applications being incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Field of invention The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of terphenyl compounds, in particular 4,4"-dihydroxy-p-terphenyls. Background of the invention Dihydroxyterphenyls, in particular 4,4"-dihydroxy-p-terphenyls are very useful starting materials in the manufacturing of polymeric materials, in particular polyarylene ether sulfone (PAES) polymers, which are particularly suitable in more demanding, corrosive, harsh chemical, high-pressure and high- temperature (HP/HT) environments, such as notably in oil and gas downhole applications. Specifically, 4,4"-dihydroxy-p-terphenyls can be prepared by various ways. 4,4"-dihydroxy-p-terphenyl can notably be synthesized by a Kumada coupling of anisole magnesiumbromide and 1 ,4-dibromobenzene in the presence of a Pd catalyst such as notably described in Y.K. Han, A. Reiser, Macromolecules, 1998, V 31, P 8789-8793 and A.K. Salunke et al, J. Polym. Sci., Part A : Polymer Chemistry, 2002, Vol. 40, 55 - 69. However, the use of a homogeneous palladium catalyst and of brominated raw materials presents a high cost. Alternatively, 4,4"-dihydroxy-p-terphenyl can be obtained by tetrazotization of 4,4"-diaminoterphenyl, thereby forming a tetrazotized product. Replacement of the the diazonium groups by hydroxyl groups in an acid environment results in the forming of 4,4"-dihydroxy-p-terphenyl, as notably described by Charles C. Price and George P. Mueller in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1944, 66 (4), pp 632-634. Further, U.S. Patent No. 5,008,472 discloses a process for preparing 4,4"-dihydroxyterphenyl by sulfonation of the terphenyl moiety thereby resulting in the formation of terphenyl-4,4"-disulfonic acid. Caustic hydrolysis of said terphenyl-4,4"-disulfonic acid, which may be in the form of a dialkali metal salt, provides 4,4"-dihydroxyterphenyl. The disadvantage of these two routes, as described above, is the extremely high cost of the starting raw material p-terphenyl. EP 0 343 798 Al describes the preparation of 4,4" dihydroxy-p-terphenyl, 4-hydroxybiphenyl and related compounds by condensation of cyclic diones or ketones with phenols and dehydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst, in particular Pd/C catalyst and base. In view of all the above, there is still a current shortfall in the art for an improved process for the manufacture of dihydroxy terphenyl compounds, in particular 4,4" dihydroxy-p-terphenyl, which can provide dihydroxy terphenyl compounds in high yield, in an efficient manner and by using widely available raw and cheap starting materials and catalysts, and thus suitable to be used as a low cost commercial industrial process. Detailed description of the present invention The Applicant has now found that it is possible to advantageously manufacture dihydroxy terphenyl compound, and derivatives thereof, in a very high yield by an easily accessible industrial process, which is advantageously overcoming all the drawbacks of prior art process, as mentioned above.
