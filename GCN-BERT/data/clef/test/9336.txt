Step 2: 1-(2,5-dichloropyrimidin-4-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-one
N1-(2,5-dichloropyrimidin-4-yl)benzene-1,2-diamine (100 mg, 0.39 mmol) was dissolved in ethyl acetate (5 mL), and diisopropylethylamine (151 mg, 1.17 mmol) was added thereto and cooled in an ice-water bath. Then triphosgene (71 mg, 0.24 mmol) was added in batches. The resulting mixture was allowed to naturally warm to room temperature, and stirring was continued for 1 hour. Saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (10 mL) was added, and stirring was continued for 10 minutes. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL*2), and the organic phases were combined, washed with saturated brine and concentrated under vacuum to remove the solvent to give the title compound (105 mg, 95%).
