I have only shown the inslators 45 and 46 "carried by the cross arm 5, but it will of course be understood , that these insulators "depaïidrfrom each cross arm. For the sake of illustration however, it is only necessary to show those carried by the cross arm 5» ITormally the wires 38 and 35 are «V j il oeirriiu: 'b;;- Vio inisvlztovu 7 and 9, 16 and 1' anddPft., When they ar, transposed as illustrated however, the wires and 39 are carried fro;.' the Jni rtor» 7 -ri c) -n i-,« c-, -, + -j-.i.-Hi..... luj: ( a...a j uo ojie insulator and from thence again forward to the insulators 28 and 2.5. Tae wires 36 and 3? carried hy the insulators 8 and 7X, 17 and 18 and 26 and 27 are transposed so that on the cross arm both wires are carried hy the insulator 17, the .Innermost wires or pole wires 39 and 40 are shown extending in a parallel direction, Tnit these also may be transposed in any way desired, following the common practice. My invention is for the purpose of supporting the wires when in a transposed position. I have only described the transposing of the .wires on the near side of each pole 1. 2 and 3. In Figure 4. the wires on the opposite sides of the poles are similarly transposed. When it is desired to renew a cress arm I employ the following device which I will now describe:. 49 is a supplemental cross arm which is detachably secured to the pole above the ordinary cross arm which is to be removed for renewal. The supplemental cross arm 49 is divided into two portions hingedly connected together as indicated at 50, 51 are a series of hooks depending from the cross arm 49.and corresponding in number to the number of wires carried by the ordinary cross arm. In order to oonneot my supplemental cross arm to the pole I provide a shoe member 52 carried oentrally upon the cross arm 4.9 and fitting against the face of the pole as clearly indicated in Figure 3, The central portion of the cross arm 4.9 is provided with a metal strip 53 through which and the cross arm extend eye bolts 54 adjustably secured by nuts 55. The'eye bolts 54 are located in the supplemental cross arm 49 so as to extend at each side of the pole to which the cross arm is to bè secured. 56 is a chain connected at its free ends to the eye bolts 52 and 53. When the cross arm is to"-be placed in position. il' • ; : on the pole one of the eye l>olts 54 is unscrewed iSSBQQO oross arm and the chain 56 passed arcmnd the pole, the shoo 52 fitting against the pole as illustrated. The removed eye holt is then rescrewed into the supplemental cross arm and drawn sufficiently tight to provide a clamping action around the pole, securing the supplemental cross arm definitely in position. 57 and 58 are pivoted merabers carried in proximity to each end of the supplemental oross arm 49, each member 57 being provided with a series of notches 58, 59, 60 and 61. The members. 57 serve to support the wires 35, 36, 37 and 38 on one side of the pole and the wires 41,42,43,44, and 45 on the opposite side of the pole. In order to support the pole wires when transposed I provide supplemental members 62 and 63 also mounted upon the supplemental cross arm 49 in proximity to the pole. Each of the members 62 and 63 are provided with notches 64 and 65. When it is desired to renew a cross arm carrying wires, which are untransposed, all that is necessary to do is to £y fix my supplemental oross arm to the pole above the ordinary &,,'. oross arm, detaoh the wires from the insulators and v lift them into engagement with the hooks 51• When howôTer, ' , : i the wires carried by the cross arm are transposed I utilize r- i*6 members 57,58,62 and 63 to support the transposed wires ft*/ jA. which may extend at various angles to the ordinary direction f >-- ' $?v " which the wires normally take. As indicated in Figure 2 the '$-. ' members 57 and 58 are swung to a position at right angles " i to the supplemental cross arm and the transposed wiares 35» v'.-. 36»37 and 38 on one side of the pole and the wires 41i42»43 I,/ fe and 44 on "tbe opposite side of the pole lifted into engagement with, the notches 58159»60 and 61, Similarly when the pole wires are transposed, these wires are detached from the porcelain insulators and lifted into engagement with the "i » fi I I rff O r- < 3 ("«/t. 'j, *.-•"*»/ notohos 64 and 65. It has 1)6811 found in practioe that hy the einpluyrnent of my device, v.'ires v.-hiah are transposed in any direction may "be carried by my supplemental support so that the ordinary crose arru rusy bo removed and renewed. V/hen it is desired only to remove an insulator Irora a cross arm I employ a notched member such as illustrated at 6E in Figure 2 which is detached from the supplemental cross arm, a wire in close proximity to the wire carried by the Insulator to be removed is engaged with, one of the notches of such member and the wire of the insulator to be removed with the other notch, thereby temporarily carrying such wire while the insulator is being removed. From this description it will be seen that I have devised a very simple device whereby wires which are transposed or untransposed may. be temporarily carried on the pôles while the workmen are renewing the cross arms or "the insulator. 28B3C0 I C X A I 11 à S II Y I H V E B T I 0 H 13: 1.
