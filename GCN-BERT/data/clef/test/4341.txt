Example 6-5 : Preparation of 3,5-bis(2-aminopyrimidin-4-yl)pyridin-2-ol (XXXXII)
4,4'-(2-Methoxypyridin-3,5-diyl)bis(pyrimidin-2-amine) (XXXXI) (80 mg, 0.333 mmol) was mixed with pyridine hydrochloride (Pyridine HCl) (328 mg, 3.332 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at 170 Â°C for 4 hrs. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, neutralized with 2 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, and diluted with ethylacetate (EA). The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the title compound (43.3 mg, 32 %).
