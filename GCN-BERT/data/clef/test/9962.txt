FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the field of medicine and, more specifically, to novel heteroaryl and heterocycle compounds and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, uses and methods thereof for inhibiting the activity of PI3K and for treating inflammatory and autoimmune disorders diseases and cancer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases or PI3Ks) are a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking. After exposure of cells to various biological stimuli, PI3Ks primarily phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2, PIP2) at the 3′-OH position of the inositol ring to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PIP3) which has an important role as second messengers by working as a docking platform for lipid-binding domains, such as the pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of various cellular proteins. These include kinases (such as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt) that trigger downstream kinase cascades, and guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (such as Vav and P-Rex) that control the activity of small GTPases (T Rückle, M. K. et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2006, 5, 903-9018). Based on sequence homology and lipid substrate specificity, the PI3K family is divided into three classes, I, II, and III. The most studied and the focus of this invention, the class I PI3Ks, are heterodimeric proteins, each containing a smaller regulatory domain and a larger 110 kDa catalytic domain which occur in four isoforms differentiated as p110α, p110β, p110γ and p110δ (T. J. Sundstrom. et al Org. Biomol. Chem., 2009, 7, 840-850). Among them, p110α, p110β and p110δ together, termed as the class IA PI3K, bind to p85 regulatory subunit and are primarily activated by protein tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors (RTK) and/or Ras proteins, whereas PI3Kγ as the sole class IB member, binds to one of two noncatalytic subunits, p101 or p87, is activated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) through direct interaction with G-protein βγ dimers and Ras proteins, which are widely implicated in various aspects of immune function and regulation. All four class I catalytic PI3K isoforms show a characteristic expression pattern in vivo. p110α and p110β are ubiquitously expressed, while p110γ and p110δ are found predominantly in leukocytes, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (T. J. Sundstrom. et al Org. Biomol. Chem., 2009, 7, 840-850). Deletion of the class IA isoform p110α or β induces embryonic lethality (E9.5-E10) (Bi L, Okabe I. et al. J Biol Chem, 1999, 274: 10963-8.; Bi L, Okabe I. et al. Mamm Genome. 2002, 13, 169-72) p110γ-deficient mice develop and reproduce normally, although they have suboptimal immune responses because of defects in T-cell activation as well as in neutrophil and macrophage migration. The loss of p110δ mice are also viable and fertile but exhibit significant defects in T, B cell activation (A Ghigo. et al. BioEssays 2010, 32: 185-196). Dysregulation and overactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been firmly established in cancer cells. In principle, modulating PI3K and thus controlling PIP3 levels should regulate AKT activity and ultimately suppress tumor growth. The expression of PI3Kδ is generally restricted to hematopoietic cell types. The p110δ isoform is constitutively activated in B cell tumors. Genetic and pharmacologic approaches that specifically inactivate the p110δ isoform have demonstrated its important role for the treatment of B cell malignancy (B. J. Lannutti. et al. Blood. 2011, 117, 591-594). Previous studies have shown that CAL-101, a potent and selective p110 inhibitor, has broad antitumor activity against cancer cells of hematologic origin. (Lannutti B. J. Am Soc Hematol. 2008; 112. Abstract 16; Flinn I. W. et al. J. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 27(A3543)) In addition to cancer, PI3K has also been suggested as a target for inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The isoforms p110δ and p110γ are mainly expressed in cells of the immune system and contributes to innate and adaptive immunity. p110δ and p110γ regulate diverse immune cell function. For example, inhibition of p110δ leads to suppression of B-cell activation and function, suppression of T-lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell trafficking, and Th1-Th2 differentiation and Treg function. Inhibition of both p110δ and p110γ results in inhibition of neutrophil (leukocyte) chemotaxis, inhibition of mast cell activation, intact macrophage phagocytosis and endothelium activation. Inhibition of p110g could activate microglial (C. Rommel. et al. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, 2010, 1, 346, 279-299). So isoform-specific p110δ or p110γ inhibitors are expected to have therapeutic effects on these diseases without interfering with general PI3K signaling critical to the normal function of other cellular systems. p110δ and p110γ supporting the hypothesis that p110 alone p110 alone or dual-blockade of both, all present a unique therapeutic opportunity in that pharmacological inhibition, but the two PI3K isoforms simultaneously may yield more superior clinical results in the treatment of a variety of complex immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. In the case of RA, Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), most notably PI3Kδ and PI3Kγ, have crucial and specific roles at all stages of disease progression: in antigen signalling in B and T cells, and in signalling downstream of FcRs, cytokine receptors and chemokine receptors in mast cells, macrophages, neutrophils and synoviocytes (C. Rommel. et al. Nature Reviews Immunology, 2007, 7, 191-201). Although the pathogenesis of RA is not yet completely understood, chemokines and other chemoattractants have been detected in the inflamed joint and are responsible for the recruitment of leukocytes into the joints. Amongst these, neutrophils constitute the most abundant population and are capable of inducing inflammatory response and tissue damage (T Rückle, M. K. et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2006, 5, 903-9018). Blockade of hematopoietic PI3 and/or PI3K can potently suppresses neutrophil chemotaxis and, in turn, the progression of joint inflammation and cartilage erosion. Novel compounds are disclosed which in some instances are inhibitors of PI3Ks kinase activity including p110δ, p110γ, p110 and p110β. These compounds therefore have potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with inappropriate p110, p110γ, p110α and p110β activity, such as cancer, inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune diseases and leukemia etc, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), allergic disorders, respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, all pathologic conditions whose onset and/or progression is driven by an inflammatory insult, such as myocardial infarction and cancer.

Examples of bicycle cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to octahydropentalene, decahydronaphthalene, bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane, octahydro-1H-indene. Examples of single cycle cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl. Cycloalkyl also includes 3- to 12-membered monocyclic or bicyclic carbocyclic ring fused with a 5- and 6-membered aromatic ring, and the point of the attachment is on the cycloalkyl ring. “Aryl” encompasses: 5- and 6-membered C5-6 carbocyclic aromatic rings, for example, benzene; 8- to 12-membered bicyclic ring systems wherein at least one ring is carbocyclic and aromatic, for example, naphthalene; and 11- to 14-membered tricyclic ring systems wherein at least one ring is carbocyclic and aromatic, for example, fluorene. For bi- or tricyclic rings, wherein one or two carbocyclic aromatic rings are fused with other rings (such as carbocyclic, heterocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic ring), the resulting ring system is aryl, provided that the point of attachment is at the carbocyclic aromatic ring. For example, aryl includes 5- and 6-membered C5-6 carbocyclic aromatic rings fused to a 5- to 7-membered non-aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring containing one or more heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, or a 3- to 12-membered cycloalkyl, provided that the point of the attachment is on the carbocyclic aromatic rings. Bivalent radicals formed from substituted benzene derivatives and having the free valences at ring atoms are named as substituted phenylene radicals. Bivalent radicals derived from univalent polycyclic hydrocarbon radicals whose names end in “-yl” by removal of one hydrogen atom from the carbon atom with the free valence are named by adding “-idene” to the name of the corresponding univalent radical, e.g., a naphthyl group with two points of attachment is termed naphthylidene. Aryl, however, does not encompass or overlap in any way with heteroaryl, separately defined below. The term “halo” includes fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo, and the term “halogen” includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The term “heteroaryl” refers to 5- to 8-membered aromatic, monocyclic rings containing one or more, for example, from 1 to 4, or, in some embodiments, from 1 to 3, or, in some embodiments, from 1 to 2, heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon; In some embodiments monocyclic “heteroaryl” refers to 5- to 6-member aromatic containing one or more heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon;8- to 12-membered bicyclic rings containing one or more, for example, from 1 to 6, or, in some embodiments, from 1 to 5, or, in some embodiments, from 1 to 4, or, in some other embodiments, from 1 to 3, heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon and wherein at least one heteroatom is present in an aromatic ring; In some embodiments “heteroaryl” refer to 9- to 10-member bicyclic aromatic rings containing one or more heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon and wherein at least one heteroatom is present in an aromatic ring; and11- to 14-membered tricyclic rings containing one or more, for example, from 1 to 6, or in some embodiments, from 1 to 5, or, in some embodiments, from 1 to 4, or, in some embodiments, from 1 to 3, heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon and wherein at least one heteroatom is present in an aromatic ring. For bi- or tricyclic rings, wherein one or two heterocyclic aromatic rings are fused with other rings (such as carbocyclic, heterocyclic or carbocyclic aromatic ring), the resulting ring system is heteroaryl, provided that the point of attachment is at the heteroaromatic ring. For example, heteroaryl includes 5- to 6-membered heterocyclic aromatic ring fused to a 5- to 7-membered heterocyclic ring containing one or more heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, or a 5- to 7-membered cycloalkyl ring, provided that the point of the attachment is on the heterocyclic aromatic ring. When the total number of S and O atoms in the heteroaryl group exceeds 1, those heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. In some embodiments, the total number of S and O atoms in the heteroaryl group is not more than 2. In some embodiments, the total number of S and O atoms in the aromatic heterocycle is not more than 1. Examples of heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, triazinyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolinyl, isoxazolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, tetrazolyl, thienyl, benzothienyl, furyl, benzofuryl, benzoimidazolinyl, indazolyl, indolyl, triazolyl, quinolinyl, quinoxalinyl, pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidinyl, quinazolinyl, naphthyridinyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, purinyl, pyrrolopyridinyl, pyrrolopyrimidinyl, imidazolopyridinyl, imidazolopyrimidinyl, imidazolotriazinyl, triazolopyridinyl, triazolopyrimidinyl and triazolotriazinyl. Bivalent radicals derived from univalent heteroaryl radicals whose names end in “-yl” by removal of one hydrogen atom from the atom with the free valence are named by adding “-idene” to the name of the corresponding univalent radical, e.g., a pyridyl group with two points of attachment is a pyridylidene. Heteroaryl does not encompass or overlap with aryl as defined above. Substituted heteroaryl also includes ring systems substituted with one or more oxide substituents, such as pyridinyl N-oxides. The terms “heterocycle” refers to 3- to 12-membered monocyclic, bicyclic and tricyclic rings containing one or more, for example, from 1 to 5, or, in some embodiments, from 1 to 4, heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon; The rings may be saturated or partially unsaturated (i.e. have one or more double bonds), but not fully conjugated. In some embodiments “heterocycle” refers to 4-6 membered monocyclic rings containing one or more heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon. Heterocycle also includes 5- to 7-membered heterocyclic ring containing one or more heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S fused with a 5- and 6-membered carbocyclic aromatic ring or a 5- to 6-membered heterocyclic aromatic ring, and the point of the attachment is on the cycloalkyl ring. The point of the attachment may be on a carbon or heteroatom in the heterocyclic ring. The heterocycle can be substituted by oxo. Heterocycle also refers to an aliphatic spirocyclic ring containing one or more heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, provided that the point of attachment is at the heterocyclic ring. Suitable heterocycles include, but not limited to, azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, pyrazolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, oxazolidinyl, thiazolidinyl and thiomorpholinyl. By “optional” or “optionally” is meant that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, “optionally substituted alkyl” encompasses both “unsubstituted alkyl” and “substituted alkyl” as defined below. It will be understood by those skilled in the art, with respect to any group containing one or more substituents, that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution patterns that are sterically impractical, synthetically non-feasible and/or inherently unstable. The term “substituted”, as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom or group is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded. When a substituent is oxo (i.e., ═O) then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds or useful synthetic intermediates. A stable compound or stable structure is meant to imply a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation from a reaction mixture, and subsequent formulation as an agent having at least practical utility. Unless otherwise specified, substituents are named into the core structure. For example, it is to be understood that when (cycloalkyl)alkyl is listed as a possible substituent, the point of attachment of this substituent to the core structure is in the alkyl portion. Compounds described herein include, but are not limited to, their optical isomers, racemates, and other mixtures thereof. In those situations, the single enantiomers or diastereomers, i.e., optically active forms, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis or by resolution of the racemates or mixtures of diastereomers. Resolution of the racemates or mixtures of diastereomers can be accomplished, for example, by conventional methods such as crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent, or chromatography, using, for example a chiral high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) column. In addition, such compounds include R- and S-forms of compounds with chiral centers. Such compounds also include crystal forms including polymorphs and clathrates. Similarly, the term “salt” is intended to include all isomers, racemates, other mixtures, R- and S-forms, tautomeric forms and crystal forms of the salt of the compound. The invention includes also pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds represented by Formula I-1, preferably of those described below and of the specific compounds exemplified herein, and methods using such salts. A “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is intended to mean a salt of a free acid or base of a compound represented by Formula I-1 that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, or otherwise biologically suitable for administration to the subject. See, generally, S. M. Berge, et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66:1-19, and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts, Properties, Selection, and Use, Stahl and Wermuth, Eds., Wiley-VCH and VHCA, Zurich, 2002. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those that are pharmacologically effective and suitable for contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, or allergic response. A compound of Formula I-1 may possess a sufficiently acidic group, a sufficiently basic group, or both types of functional groups, and accordingly react with a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogen-phosphates, dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates, oxalates, malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyne-1,4-dioates, hexyne-1,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methyl benzoates, dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates, xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates, lactates, γ-hydroxybutyrates, glycolates, tartrates, methane-sulfonates, propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and mandelates. If the compound of Formula I-1 contains a basic nitrogen, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, nitric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, phenylacetic acid, propionic acid, stearic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, isethionic acid, succinic acid, valeric acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid, such as mandelic acid, citric acid, or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, naphthoic acid, or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as laurylsulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, any compatible mixture of acids such as those given as examples herein, and any other acid and mixture thereof that are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light of the ordinary level of skill in this technology. If the compound of Formula I-1 is an acid, such as a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, any compatible mixture of bases such as those given as examples herein, and any other base and mixture thereof that are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light of the ordinary level of skill in this technology. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine, ammonia, carbonates, bicarbonates, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as benzylamines, pyrrolidines, piperidine, morpholine, and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, and lithium. A “solvate,” such as a “hydrate,” is formed by the interaction of a solvent and a compound. The term “compound” is intended to include solvates, including hydrates, of compounds. Similarly, “salts” includes solvates, such as hydrates, of salts. Suitable solvates are pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, such as hydrates, including monohydrates and hemi-hydrates. As used herein the terms “group”, “radical” or “fragment” are synonymous and are intended to indicate functional groups or fragments of molecules attachable to a bond or other fragments of molecules. The term “active agent” is used to indicate a chemical substance which has biological activity. In some embodiments, an “active agent” is a chemical substance having pharmaceutical utility. The terms “treating” or “treatment” or “alleviation” refers to adimnistering at least on compounds/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein to a subject to slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the developmnt or spread of inflammation or cancer. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. “Treatment” can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those with the condition or disorder.) The term “effective amount” means an amount or dose of a PI3K-inhibiting agent sufficient to generally bring about a therapeutic benefit in patients in need of treatment for a disease, disorder, or condition mediated by PI3K activity. Effective amounts or doses of the active agents of the present invention may be ascertained by routine methods such as modeling, dose escalation studies or clinical trials, and by taking into consideration routine factors, e.g., the mode or route of administration or drug delivery, the pharmacokinetics of the agent, the severity and course of the disease, disorder, or condition, the subject's previous or ongoing therapy, the subject's health status and response to drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. An exemplary dose is in the range of from about 0.0001 to about 200 mg of active agent per kg of subject's body weight per day, preferably about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg/day, or about 0.01 to 35 mg/kg/day, or about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg daily in single or divided dosage units (e.g., BID, TID, QID). For a 70-kg human, an illustrative range for a suitable dosage amount is from about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, or about 0.2 to about 5 g/day. Once improvement of the patient's disease, disorder, or condition has occurred, the dose may be adjusted for maintenance treatment. For example, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the desired therapeutic effect is maintained. Of course, if symptoms have been alleviated to an appropriate level, treatment may cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms. The term “inhibition” indicates a decrease in the baseline activity of a biological activity or process. “Inhibition of PI3K activity” refers to a decrease in the activity of PI3K as a direct or indirect response to the presence of at least one at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein, relative to the activity of PI3K in the absence of the at least one compound and/or the at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The decrease in activity may be due to the direct interaction of the at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein with PI3K, or due to the interaction of the at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein, with one or more other factors that in turn affect PI3K activity. For example, the presence of at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein, may decrease PI3K activity by directly binding to the PI3K, by causing (directly or indirectly) another factor to decrease PI3K activity, or by (directly or indirectly) decreasing the amount of PI3K present in the cell or organism. In addition, the active agents of the invention may be used in combination with additional active ingredients in the treatment of the above conditions. The additional active ingredients may be coadministered separately with an active agent of Formula I-1 or included with such an agent in a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention. In an exemplary embodiment, additional active ingredients are those that are known or discovered to be effective in the treatment of conditions, disorders, or diseases mediated by PI3K activity, such as another PI3K modulator or a compound active against another target associated with the particular condition, disorder, or disease. The combination may serve to increase efficacy (e.g., by including in the combination a compound potentiating the potency or effectiveness of an active agent according to the invention), decrease one or more side effects, or decrease the required dose of the active agent according to the invention. The active agents of the invention are used, alone or in combination with one or more additional active ingredients, to formulate pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises: (a) an effective amount of at least one active agent in accordance with the invention; and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. A “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” refers to a substance that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, and otherwise biologically suitable for administration to a subject, such as an inert substance, added to a pharmacological composition or otherwise used as a vehicle, carrier, or diluent to facilitate administration of a agent and that is compatible therewith. Examples of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils, and polyethylene glycols. Delivery forms of the pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more dosage units of the active agents may be prepared using suitable pharmaceutical excipients and compounding techniques known or that become available to those skilled in the art. The compositions may be administered in the inventive methods by a suitable route of delivery, e.g., oral, parenteral, rectal, topical, or ocular routes, or by inhalation. The preparation may be in the form of tablets, capsules, sachets, dragees, powders, granules, lozenges, powders for reconstitution, liquid preparations, or suppositories. Preferably, the compositions are formulated for intravenous infusion, topical administration, or oral administration. For oral administration, the active agents of the invention can be provided in the form of tablets or capsules, or as a solution, emulsion, or suspension. To prepare the oral compositions, the active agents may be formulated to yield a dosage of, e.g., from about 5 mg to 5 g daily, or from about 50 mg to 5 g daily, in single or divided doses. For example, a total daily dosage of about 5 mg to 5 g daily may be accomplished by dosing once, twice, three, or four times per day. Oral tablets may include the active ingredient(s) mixed with compatible pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservative agents. Suitable inert fillers include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, lactose, starch, sugar, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol, and the like. Exemplary liquid oral excipients include ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Starch, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP), sodium starch glycolate, microcrystalline cellulose, and alginic acid are exemplary disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin. The lubricating agent, if present, may be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, or may be coated with an enteric coating. Capsules for oral administration include hard and soft gelatin capsules. To prepare hard gelatin capsules, active ingredient(s) may be mixed with a solid, semi-solid, or liquid diluent. Soft gelatin capsules may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with water, an oil such as peanut oil or olive oil, liquid paraffin, a mixture of mono and di-glycerides of short chain fatty acids, polyethylene glycol 400, or propylene glycol. Liquids for oral administration may be in the form of suspensions, solutions, emulsions or syrups or may be lyophilized or presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid compositions may optionally contain: pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose, sodium alginate, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum stearate gel and the like); non-aqueous vehicles, e.g., oil (for example, almond oil or fractionated coconut oil), propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, or water; preservatives (for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid); wetting agents such as lecithin; and, if desired, flavoring or coloring agents. The active agents of this invention may also be administered by non-oral routes. For example, compositions may be formulated for rectal administration as a suppository. For parenteral use, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous routes, the agents of the invention may be provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to an appropriate pH and isotonicity or in parenterally acceptable oil. Suitable aqueous vehicles include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. Such forms may be presented in unit-dose form such as ampules or disposable injection devices, in multi-dose forms such as vials from which the appropriate dose may be withdrawn, or in a solid form or pre-concentrate that can be used to prepare an injectable formulation. Illustrative infusion doses range from about 1 to 1000 μg/kg/minute of agent admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier over a period ranging from several minutes to several days. For topical administration, the agents may be mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier at a concentration of about 0.1% to about 10% of drug to vehicle. Another mode of administering the agents of the invention may utilize a patch formulation to affect transdermal delivery. Active agents may alternatively be administered in methods of this invention by inhalation, via the nasal or oral routes, e.g., in a spray formulation also containing a suitable carrier. The compounds described herein, and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be synthesized from commercially available starting materials by methods well known in the art. The following schemes illustrate methods for most of compound preparation. In each of the schemes, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and W are as defined herein.

After addition, the reaction spontaneously heated to reflux for about 5 min, then reacted at 60-70° C. for another 1.5 hours. After cooled to r.t., hexane (300 mL) and water (300 mL) were added to the mixture. The organic layer was separated, collected and concentrated. The residue was used in the next step without further purification. To a mixture of the crude 4,4-dichloro-5-(trichloromethyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole (240 g, 941 mmol) in MeOH (2 L) in an ice-bath was added a solution of NaOMe (324 g, 6 mol) in MeOH (1.5 L) drop-wise over an hour. After addition, the mixture was stirred at r.t. for another one hour. Then 2N HCl aq. was added to adjust its pH to 2 and the resulting was stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes. The mixture was concentrated and diluted with EtOAc (2.5 L) and water (2 L). The organic layer was separated, concentrated and purified by column chromatography eluting with EtOAc/PE and then crystallize upon standing.

(3 mL, 26.0 mmol) and water (20 mL) was added NaNO2 (966 mg, 14.0 mmol) in water (3 mL) at −5° C. The resulting mixture was then stirred at −5° C. for another 30 minutes. CuBr (2.01 g, 14.0 mmol, fine powder) was added portion-wise at this temperature, and the mixture was stirred at r.t. for 30 minutes and refluxed for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was then extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was separated, concentrated and purified by flash column chromatography, eluting with EtOAc/PE to afford ethyl 3-bromo-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylate as a yellow solid (562 mg, yield: 52%).

Intermediate 3 1-Amino-3-chloro-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamide To a mixture of 60% NaH (12 g, 0.3 mol) in DMF (100 mL) at 0° C. was added methyl 3-chloro-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylate (32 g, 0.2 mol) in DMF (100 mL) dropwise over one hour. After stirred at 0° C. for another 2.5 hours, to the light brown mixture was added a solution of O-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)hydroxylamine (48 g, 0.24 mol) in DMF (100 mL) slowly over 30 minutes. The reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 2.5 hours and warmed to room temperature overnight. The mixture was quenched by Na2S2O3 aq. and extracted with EtOAc and washed with 10% LiCl aq.

Primary screening data and IC50 values are measured using Transcreener™ KINASE Assay (Bellbrook, Catalog #3003-10K). The assay can be carried out according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. It is a universal, homogenous, high throughput screening (HTS) technology using a far-red, competitive fluorescence polarization immunoassay based on the detection of ADP to monitor the activity of enzymes that catalyze group transfer reactions. Briefly, the Transcreener KINASE Assay is designed as a simple two-part, endpoint assay. In the first step, the 25 ul kinase reaction is performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing 5 ul test compound (2% DMSO final concentration), 10 ul kinase, buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.03% CHAPS, 3 mM MgCl2, and freshly supplemented 1 mM DTT), and 10 ul 30 uM PIP2/10 uM ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 80 min at room temperature. Next, 25 ul ADP detection mix is added per well. The plate is sealed again and incubated for 60 min at room temperature, and then measure fluorescence polarization by Tecan Infinite F500 Reader. Data is analyzed and IC50s are generated using the add-in software for Microsoft Excel, Xlfit™ (version 2.0). IH %=(ADP amount under 2% DMSO-ADP amount under test compound)/ADP amount under 2% DMSO.
