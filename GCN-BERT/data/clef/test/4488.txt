This invention relates to starting systems for electric motors, particularly to starting systems for synchronous ous motors, and contemplates the changing, during the accelerating period of the motor, of the value of the field discharge resistance, to thereby improve the starting characteristics of the machine. When a synchronous motor is at standstill it has many of the essential orooerties of a transformer. If an alternating current is euoplied to the armature terminals, an alternating current flows in the armature winding, inducing a secondary voltage in the motor field coils. At the instant of starting, this secondary voltage has the same frequency r as the line voltage, but as the motor comes uo to geed the frequency decreases, becoming zero at synchronous speed The induced voltage le very high at the start, but as the mot( accelerates the voltage decreases with declining frequency. The general practice has been to start synchronous motors with either an open field circuit or a closed field circuit, depending somewhat upon the design of the machine. The open field method has the disadvantage of causing excessIvely high voltage strains to be imposed upon the field coll insulation because of the inductive action of the armature on the field coils. The closed field method le usually employed in conjunction with a field discharge resistance So that the induced current of the field can circulate in the field circuit, thereby avoiding the high voltage strain on the field insulation. Generally, it is true that a larger starting torque will be obtained by starting a motor with an open field than ,. í .' • . , , :. , ï /i with a closed fíeld, and conversely, a larder pull-in torque will be obtained by employing a field closed through a discharge resistance of low value. A somewhat contradictory relation thus exists between the starting and pull-in torques of a motor and the value of the field discharge resistance. The employment of a high resistance st starting to gain the advantage of high starting torque will adversely affect the pull-in torque when the motor is ready to pull into step. If a large starting torque le not as imoortant in a oartlculaz installation as a large pull-in torque, a low discharge resistance may be employed, but a low resistance has the seriou, disadvantage of impairing the Dower factor during starting, l resulting in a greater kv-a input and lower torque. 4' One of the objections to startingsynchronoqs motors with a low field discharge resistance is the excessive kv-a Drawn from the llne to the serious di8advantage of the other customers supplied by the power line. The drain of kv-a oauses a disturbance of the line voltage that is transmitted to all parts of the system, and the power factor is materially reduced. When a number of motors are thrown on the line in succession the resulting regulation falls far below the value ordinarily necessary for oroper and efficient ooeration. In order to overcome the objectionable features and disadvantages above outlined, I have devised a method and apparatus for varying the field discharge resistance during the starting period at one or more instances st which a change in the value of the resistance will bring out the best ooerating characteristics inherent in the motor. According to my invention, the motor can be started ith a high starting torque by using a high field discharge i :i•I:I: ::: T i•• i resistance or by having the field circuit ooen. The starting kv-a will thus be considerably lower than that required for low resistance starting and the torque will be curesoondingly hígher. The ratio of starting torque to the kv-a drawn from the llne will therefore be greater than for any lower value of field discharge resistance and the disturbance of the line wlll be very small comoared with that caused by starting the motor with a low discharge resistance. As the motor speed increases, the value of the resistance may be changed one or more times deoending upon the results to be obtained. By progressively reducing the field discharge resistance as the motor aoproaches synchronism, the condition for best pull-ln I torque, í. e., low discharge resistance, will ultimately be' obtained and the motor wíll have a very much higher #ul,& in torque than it would have if the discharge resistance were ot changed. In some instances it may be desired to start the motor with an open field instead of a discharge resistance of high value. The motor may thus be started so as to derive the benefit of the maximum starting torque and after it has reache a certain speed the field may be closed through a proper value of discharge resistance. After the field has been closed on the discharge resistance the value thereof nay be varied, as above described, to obtain the best pu&l-in torque. To permit of the field discharge resistance being changed at the proper instant at which a change will produce benefìcial results, I propose to employ a suitably constructed relay or relays responsive to the eleotrlcal condition of the ,I ,L" ï,., ,.,J ï • field. Since the declining frequency of the voltage and current in the field provides an exact criterion of the conditio: of the motor during the accelerating and Dull-in peson, I may so construct the relays that they will operate at different points during the starting period when the frequency of the field indicates that a change will be beneficial. If the motor is started with an ooen field a frequency responsive relay would not be operative but a time relay or & relay actuated by a speed device or a relay actuated by a decrease of llne current may be employed to close the field on a suitable value of discharge resistance at the proper ínstant. Since a variation in the load of the motor would change the starting time and the llne current, a tíme ' relay or a current relay would not be a8 sensitive to.the .t. ,, actual condítion of the motor as a speed relay. A voltage relay, actuated'by the induced voltage of the field could• also be used for this purpose. Instead of automatic means dependent upon the electr cal condition of the motor I may employ manually operated switches adapted to cut in or cut out suitable values of field discharge resistance. In such case, the operation of the switches would depend upon the accuracy with which the actual condition of the motor could be ascertained by the attendant in charge of the manually operated devices. Other provisions and features of my invention, as well as those already discussed, will be better understood by considering the following detailed description which is to be taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherelin - Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of one embodiment of my l< ?; - invention. Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are diagrams illustrating various forms of connecting a control relay in the system. Fig. 5 is a chart showing the kv-a curves for various values of discharge resistance. Fig. 6 is a chart showing the manner in which my improved method may be employed to obtain the best operating characteristics during the starting period of 8 motor. In the embodiment of my invention illustrated in Fig. 1 the armature winding of a motor M is supplied with alternating current from the a-c line through the connecting switch I0. The ngle phase field winding of the motor can I be connected to a source of excitation current through the switch ll, which is actuated by an electromagnetic control coil FO energized by current drawn from a suitable a-o source A relay FR1 responsive to the electrical conditíon of the o motor field is included in the field circuit during starting and controls a contact 3 in the circuit of the magnetic switch coll FC. Upon closing the llne switch 10, alternating current will be supDlled to the armature winding of the motor and the motor will start. As the motor starts an induced current will flow through the field rcuit provided the motor is started with a closed field circuit. If the motor is started wíth an open field no current will flow and a high voltage will be built up in the field coils. Assuming for the moment that the motor is started with a closed field, the induced current will flow from one 't ,' i » i•i ï 2 rj- •:i/:) " ":...i 2: i: : .•k.-• •j z 4..¸¸ r i « ° ,,,: I , terminal of the field, through the contact 7, the field discharge resistance FDR, the contact i4, the coll 0 of the relay FR3, the closed switch 81, the closed switch 82, the reactance Z of the relay FR1 and back to the other terminal of the field. The reactance Z has a resistance and Inductance so proportioned with resoect to the coll A of the relay FR1, that currents of high frequency will be diverted through the coil A while currents of low frequency will flow directly through the reactance itself, and, accordingly, the relay FR1 will ooen the instant an induced current flows in the field clrcuít. The contact 5 will therefore ooen and the cit. cuit of the coil FC will be broken to keep the switch ll in f ooen oosition. The amount of discharge resistance through,whlch the induced current flows depends upon the value of discharge resistance it is desired to employ during starting. If a high value of resistance is desired, the entire FUR between the contact ? an the contact 14 may be used. In such case the manually operable switch 81 is closed to include the coll C of the relay FRS. If this switch is left open, the current will Oass through FDR from contact 7 to contact 15 and then through coll B of a relay FR2 thereby leaving the oortlon 4 of the resistance out of circuit. The manually operable switch S2 is employed to short circuit contacts 8 of a!soeed relay device eR, as will be exolalned later, and is left closed for all conditions of starting for which the relay 8R is not used. As the motor comes up to speed, the decreasing frequency of the induced current flowing through the coil C of the relay FRS will reach the value at which the relay is -G- i • y íì: " ' ,. designed to operate. Th particular point in the operation of t the motor for which the relay is designed to operate depend8 upon the construction of the motor and the local conditions of load and operation conditions. Several test runs of the motor 8houlæ.be sufficient to adjust the relay for a particular poínt of operation. When the proper point of operation is reached the relay will be actuated to close a contact 1 thereby short-circuiting the portion 4 of the field, discharge resistance FDR. The short circuiting of the portion 4 reduces the value of the discharge resistance in circuit with the field and the current flows through contact 13 and coil B of relay I FR2. The relay FR2 may be of the same general frequency type as FR3 or it may be provided with additloñal adjust efit feat-, ures to permit of more sensitive operation. Since relay F2 is also in circuit during the time relay FR3 i8 in circuit, and in series with a lower value of díscharge resistance than is relay FR3, some current lll flow through the coil B while the greater part is flowing through coi& C. The coils B and C are so constructed that during the time the relay FR3 i8 in circuit the coil B has a greater impedance than coil C. A8 a result the greater oortion of the current flows through coil C. However, to prevent the current passing through coil B from actuating the relay FR2, a choking or damper ring Æs provided on one of the poles of the relay to keeo it from closing at high frequencies. A retarding tension spring 9 may also be provided to adjust the relay armature to close only when the frequency has reached a point at which it is desirable to actuate the relay. Other means such as variatio: - IL ï • . . ,fì of the air ça0 and variation of the strength of the actuating coll B may also be employed to properly adjust the relay. When the frequency reaches the value for which the relay FR is set, the relay will close an contect 2 will he established to short circuit portion 5 of the discharge resistance. The field circuit will then be from one terminal of the field, through contact 7' portion 16 of the discharge resistance, contact 12, contact 2, coil B, switch $2, reactance Z and back to the other field terminal. The portion 16 of the discharge resistance may be very small compared with the value of portions 4 and 5, it being only large enough to prevent serious arcing of the field contact ? when the field is thrown over to the d-c supply by the action of relay Fl l. As the motor approaches synchronism, the fr q eñcy of the induced field current will fall still lower and at a predetermined value will actuate relay FR1 to close contact 2 and energize coil FO, whereby the field switch ll will be closed and the contact ? opened and the field connected to the source of excitation current. The motor is thus brought up to synchronism and thrown on the line by the successive operation of the relays FR3, FR3 and FB1. During the starting period the discharge resistance of the field is varied to obtain the best operation of the motor at substantially all points between s arting and synchronism, If instead of starting the motor with a high discharge resistance and closed field it is desired to start it with an open field, a speed relay SR may be utilized to insert a suitable value of field discharge resistance at a point at which it is advantageous to change from an open to V a closed field. The switch 82 le left open, thus opening the field, and the relay SR actuated when a suitable speed is reached. The actuation of the relay SR closes contact 8 and closes the field circuit through the discharge resistance, which may comprise either the entire FDR or merely the portions 16 and 5, depending upon whether the switch 81 i6 closed or open. The amount of resistance inserted in the field circuit after the circuit is closed depends upon the characterletics of the particular machine to which the system is aoolied. After the field is once closed, the procedure of reducing the resistance in successive steps is the same as before. The relays employed in the control system need ot be of the type illustrated in Fig. l. The'€oil of the e1 ay may be connected in circuit inductively, as shown by the tran former T and coil Y of Fig 2. Or, the coil Y Qf the relay may be in parallel with either a reactance X as indicated in Fig. 3 or a resistance R as shown in Fig. 4. In all cases, t operation of the relay depends upon the electrical condition of the field circuit, regardless of whether it closes immediately as is the case with FR1 or after an interval of time as is the case with FR or FR3. In some instances it may be feasible to operate the changes in discharge resistance by manually operable means, such as switches S3 and S4. Instead of relays being connected to various sections of discharge resistance, manually operable switches may be connected at points 15, 16 and 17. When it is desired to short circuit the portion 4 of the resistance, the switch $3 is closed, and when the 0ortion 5 le to be cut out of circuit, the switch S4 is closed. The i • i •ï le variations in field discharge resistance may thus be effected by manual means as well a,s by automa,tic means, anoE for some installation8 it may be desirable to emoloy both means as 8, protective measure to prevent shutting down of the motor due to a failure of the automatic means. By 0rovlding means for varying the field discharge resistance during the starting period I am enabled to effect a considerable reduction in the kv-a drawn from the line at starting, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The curves 5R and 10R indicate the kv-a dra,wn from the line by a motor employing a discharge resistance of respectively, 5 and l0 times the value of the field resistance. The ooen circuit curve is self explanatory. The wide difference in the value of kv-a at' i low soeed between the Open circuit curve and the 5R çurve' indicates the desirability of employing as high a resistance as possible a,t the instant of starting. As the,motor gain speed the difference becomes less, so that a change from oçen circuit to some value such as 10R will not result in any considerable increase in kv-a. The torque developed by a motor using various values of field discharge resi ta,nce, la shown in Fig. 6. The b'R, 10R and ooen circuit curves aoply to the same conditions as those explained in connection with Fìg. 5. The main feature of the chart is the relation between starting and pull-!n torque and the value of discharge resistance. Thus, the oçen circuit curve indicates the highest starting torque but the lowest pull-in torque which, for purposes of description, may be cohsidered to occur at aoproximately 95% of synchronous eçeed. The 5R curve, on the aether hand, has the lowest start ing torque and the highest pull-in torque, while the 10R curve .ç • i i¸ ï ii .4,. ... • possesses va, lues falling somewhere between the other two. If, as according to my invention, the field is started on very high discharge resistance, or open circuit, the torque developed will be along the heavy curve from A to B. At B, the developed torque is less than that obtainable with discharge resistance of 10R, therefore the field 18 closed on a discharge resistance of 10R. The torque now developed will be along the heavy curve from B to C. At C the developed torque is less than that obtained with a resistance of 5R, therefore the discharge resistance is reduced again. The torque will then follow the heavy line from C to the point of pull-in, whích occurs at about 95% of synchronous speed. i By interpolation from the chart, the value of torque developed at 95¢ seed, or cull-in, on the_heavy 5R,c rye is about ?0 of the full load torque of the machine. The value of the torque developed on the 10R curve is about 35%, while that of the open circuit curve la about 0%. The reduction of the discharge resistance from 10R to 5R therefore results in an increase of pull-in torque of aooroximately 100%. 81milarly, an increase of the resistance from 5R to open circuit at starting increases the starting torque from about 90¢ of the full load torque to about 115% of the full load torque, or a gain of approximately 26+%. A variation in the discharge resistance of the! motor • from an increase at starting to a decrease at pull-ln therefore results in e. material increase of the starting torque and a considerable increase of the cull-in torque, while at the same time maintaining the best operating characteristics of the motor during the accelerating period. With an increased !-starting torque there is a corresoonding decrease in kv-a -lli, i input and a consequent increase in torque per kv-a. The power factor of the line is improved and the motor is operate( during the startíng period under conditions adapted to bring out the best operating characteristics inherent in the constzuctlon of the motor. It is to be understood that the expression "pullin torque" is emoloyed for the ouroose of describing that torque whích exists when the machine le near synchronism. It is to be understood that the coordination of the various features of my improved method may be varied without departing from the scope of the invention, which is not llmited to the particular embodiment shown and described, but which includes such modifications thereof as fall within 'the scope of the appended claims. .... 1 .;« ,, i I Claim: I.
