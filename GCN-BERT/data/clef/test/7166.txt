STATEMENT OF RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is filed under 35 U.S.C. §371 as the U.S. national phase of International Application PCT/US2009/066467, filed Dec. 2, 2009, which designated the U.S. and claims the benefit of U.S. provisional applications 61/119,723 filed Dec. 3, 2008; 61/173,590 filed Apr. 28, 2009; and 61/182,952 filed Jun. 1, 2009. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to compounds useful for inhibiting hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) replication, particularly functions of the non-structural 5A (“NS5A”) protein of HCV. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the Flaviviridae family. The virus shows extensive genetic heterogeneity as there are currently seven identified genotypes and more than 50 identified subtypes. In HCV infected cells, viral RNA is translated into a polyprotein that is cleaved into ten individual proteins. At the amino terminus are structural proteins: the core (C) protein and the envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2. p7, an integral membrane protein, follows E1 and E2. Additionally, there are six non-structural proteins, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B, which play a functional role in the HCV lifecycle. (see, for example, Lindenbach, B. D. and C. M. Rice, Nature. 436:933-938, 2005). Infection by HCV is a serious health issue. It is estimated that 170 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HCV. HCV infection can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic HCV infection is thus a major worldwide cause of liver-related premature mortality. The present standard of care treatment regimen for HCV infection involves interferon-alpha, alone, or in combination with ribavirin. The treatment is cumbersome and sometimes has debilitating and severe side effects and many patients do not durably respond to treatment. New and effective methods of treating HCV infection are urgently needed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Essential features of the NS5A protein of HCV make it an ideal target for inhibitors. The present disclosure describes a class of compounds targeting the NS5A protein and methods of their use to treat HCV infection in humans.

The compounds of the present invention include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of XII as well as an optically pure enantiomer, racemate or diastereomeric mixtures thereof. The compounds of the invention are prepared by synthetic routes and procedures that are illustrated in the various synthetic schemes below. The synthetic routes shown in schemes below are disclosed for the purpose of illustration and are not meant to be interpreted as limiting the processes to make the embodied compounds by any other methods. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a number of methods are available for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. These compounds may be prepared by processes which include processes known in the chemical art for the production of structurally analogous compounds or by a novel process described herein. One of the general strategies includes building the central scaffold followed by gradual functional group transformations of the two ends either simultaneously. In order to differentially functionalize the two ends, some orthogonal functional group protection and deprotection strategies are used (T. W. Greene & P. G. M. Wutts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, 3rd edition, 1999). Another synthetic strategy entails the construction of the two halves of the molecule separately and coupling them toward the end of the synthesis. The cross coupling techniques employ conditions such as the Sonogashira, Suzuki-Miayura, or Stille reaction for connecting carbon-carbon bonds. For scaffold cores linked via a carbon-nitrogen bond, their syntheses typically utilize a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, a Buchwald or a Ma cross coupling reaction. The functional groups, typically amines and carboxyl groups on either ends of the cores are generally orthogonally protected to allow for selective further manipulations as needed.

Scheme 1-3 outlines the preparation of core structures connected through a carbon-nitrogen bond. The nitrogen arylation is achieved using one of the several methods. In one embodiment, the acetophenone moiety and the V group in A-17 can be sequentially converted to a bromoketone as in A-18 for further introduction of the A-19 moiety. The coupling between A-15 and A-16 to A-17 represents a nucleophilic aromatic substitution method. Other methodologies employed include Buchwald or Ma couplings (J. Org. Chem. 2005, 70, 164), such as the coupling of A-15 with A-20 to B-6, A-15 with A-22 to B-7, A-21 with A-22 to B-8. When V is a carboxylate, it can be extended via an amide linkage. Taking B-6 as an example, the carboxylate can undergo a Curtis rearrangement to an amine, which in turn can be transformed to an amide (B-6 to B-9). Alternatively, the carboxylate can be hydrolyzed and converted to B-10 when reacts with a protected form of pyrrolidin-2-ylmethanamine. The methodologies outlined in this scheme are further depicted in other schemes described herein. Scheme 1-4 illustrates some of the ways for further functional group transformations using scaffold B-1 as an example. Starting from a properly protected B-1, the nitrogen protecting groups P and P′ can be removed simultaneously to give B-1a. When B-1a is treated together a suitably protected amino acid under standard peptide coupling conditions, such as HATU and a tertiary amine base, e.g. Hünig's base, the doubly coupled product B-1b is obtained. Typically, P refers to a protecting group such as Boc-, Cbz-, Troc-, etc. P can also be other alkyl, acyl, alkoxylcarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl groups that are intended for this position. When P is one of the removable groups, upon its removal, the free the amino group can be further derivatized to B-1c. The definition of Cap group is P and P′. The protecting groups P and P′ can be removed selectively to free one of the two amino groups in B-1 as in the case of B-1 to B-1d. These skilled in the art will understand that the P′ group can be deprotected while the P group is preserved to give an alternative structure such as B-1d. The free amino group of B-1d is coupled with another properly functionalized amino acid to give B-1e. When this process of selective deprotection and functionalization is repeated, compound B-1f is obtained. The newly introduced amino acid in B-1f can be the same as the residue on the left-hand side of the molecule or can be a different one. From B-1f, a variety of compounds (with a general formula of B-1g) are prepared with differentially functionalized end pieces. In another embodiment, several key intermediates used in the construction of claimed scaffolds are depicted in the following schemes. Scheme 1-5 using an L-proline-based structure as an example describes the synthesis of several key imidazole intermediates that are used for the construction of various more advanced intermediates in this invention. (References: a. Polyhedron 2005, 24, 2625, b. WO2008/021927). The readily available L-prolinaldehyde is converted to imidazole A-24 by reacting with glyoxal in the presence of ammonium hydroxide. The monohalogenation (bromination or iodination) is best achieved via a two-step sequence, i.e. non-selective dihalogenation followed by a selective removal of one of the two halogen atoms to A-26. To facilitate the further functionalization, the imidazole moiety is preferably protected with SEM or other protecting groups. The protection process does generate a mixture of regioisomers of the protecting group. However, such a mixture does not usually affect the reactivity of the intermediates toward further reaction and will become one compound upon the removal of the protecting group. The iodo- or bromo-imidazole intermediate A-27 is used converted to is the corresponding borate A-28 under the conditions shown, or using conditions that are known to promote similar transformations. When the same intermediate A-27 is subjected to Sonogoshira coupling conditions, the acetylene compound A-28 is obtained after subsequent treatment with base. The use of intermediate as an alternative method of synthesizing arylimidazole intermediates such as A-1 and B-3 is illustrated in Scheme 1-1. These versatile building blocks are used in many other manners as will be shown in the schemes to follow. In another embodiment, the aryl-imidazole and benzoimidazole building blocks are synthesized using the route described in Scheme 1-6 (Ref. J. Med. Chem. 2008, 51, 5109; 2006, 49, 3774; and 2002, 45, 5556). Those in the art shall recognize that the phenyl, the proline and the protecting group on nitrogen may be replaced in order to achieve the desired functionality at a given position. In another embodiment, the building blocks used in Scheme 1-1 for the synthesis of scaffolds such as B-1 to B-4 and others are synthesized using routes described in Scheme 1-7. The preparation of A-1a starts with the dimethyl bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-dicarboxylate, one of the methyl ester group is selectively hydrolyzed to the acid, which in turn is converted to a bromo group to give methyl 4-bromobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate. A Friedel-Crafts reaction between methyl 4-bromobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate and a substituted benzene yields A-1a (Ref. J. Org. Chem. 1970, 35, 917). Compound A-1b is prepared similarly. Another method to prepare the cyclohexyl-containing compounds such as A-1b and A-1b′ is through a cross coupling reaction between vinyltrifolate and a phenylboronate (or a boronic acid). The letter V represents a carboxylate group, such as an ethoxylcarbonyl, or a protected amino group, or can be another functional group that can be further functionalized. Following the coupling step, the resulted styrenyl group can be preserved (A-1b′) or can be saturated under hydrogenation condition to give A-1b. The cyclopentyl analog A-1c may be made by similar route. The four-carbon analog is made in sequence as shown. Synthesis of Example Compounds The examples below provide exemplary synthetic methods for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. One of skill in the art will understand that additional methods are also useful. The compounds of the invention can be made using conventional organic synthesis using starting materials, reagents and reactions well known in the art. Reagents and solvents used below can be obtained from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis., USA). 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz or 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. Significant peaks are tabulated in the order: multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet), coupling constant(s) in Hertz (Hz) and number of protons. Electrospray spray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry analysis was conducted on a Hewlett-Packard 1100 MSD electrospray mass spectrometer using the HP1 100 HPLC for sample delivery. Mass spectrometry results are reported as the ratio of mass over charge, followed by the relative abundance of each ion (in parentheses) or a single m/z value for the M+H (or, as noted, M−H) ion containing the most common atomic isotopes. Isotope patterns correspond to the expected formula in all cases. Normally the analyte was dissolved in methanol at 0.1 mg/mL and 5 microliter was infused with the delivery solvent into the mass spectrometer, which scanned from 100 to 1500 daltons. All compounds could be analyzed in the positive ESI mode, using an acetonitrile/water gradient (10%-90%) acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid as delivery solvent. The compounds provided below could also be analyzed in the negative ESI mode, using 2 mM NH4OAc in acetonitrile/water as delivery solvent. Enantiomeric purity was determined using a Hewlett-Packard Series 1050 system equipped with a chiral HLPC column (ChiralPak AD, 4.6 mm×150 mm) and isocratic elution using 5:95 isopropanol-hexane as a mobile phase.
