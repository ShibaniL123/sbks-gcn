Example 4. 2,4-Diamino-5-cyano-6-(1-(4-oxo-2-phenyl-4H-chromen-3-yl) ethylamino) pyrimidine
3-(1-Aminoethyl)-2-phenyl-4H-chromen-4-one hydrochloride (700mg, 3.32mmol) obtained in step 5 of Example 3, 2,4-diamino-5-cyano-6-chloropyrimidine (716mg, 4.65mmol) and potassium carbonate (1.6g, 11.62mmol) were dissolved in 20ml DMF and reacted in a 100Â°C oil bath for 24h. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. Water was added to the reaction solution, and the reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, subjected to spin drying and made into a mixture for chromatography, and separated by column chromatography to give 20mg of a white solid with a yield of 5.2%.
