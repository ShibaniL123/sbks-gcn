1 The present invention pertains to a' process for 2 the preparation of 5~amino-2- substituted benzimidazoles 3 which have anthelmintic activity. 4 Certain 5-amino-2- substituted benzimidazoles are known in the art and have been prepared by various methods. 6 By one method, a 5-amino-2- substituted benzimidazole can be 7 prepared by reacting 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine with excess 8 urea to yield 5-nitro-2-hydroxybenzimidazole; the latter 9 benzimidazole is converted to the chloro compound by reflux- ing said benzimidazole in phosphorus oxychloride, and the 11 chloronitro benzimidazole is then reacted with an amine such 12 as piperidine, and finally reduced in an alcoholic solution 13 with hydrogen in the presence of Raney nickel to a 5-amino- 14 2- substituted benzimidazole, for example 5-amino-2-piperidino benzimidazole. By another procedure, 5-amino-2- substituted 16 benzimidazoles can be prepared by reacting 1,2,4-triamino- 17 benzenedihydrochloride with, for example, phenyl acetic acid - 1 1 in the presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid to yield 2 5-ajnino-2-benzyl benzimidazole or, alternatively, by reacting 3 the triaminobenzenedihydrochloride with benzyl alcohol to 4 yield 5-ainino-2-phenyl benzimidazole. By the present inven- tion, nitration is made possible directly on the 2- substituted 6 benzimidazole with subsequent reduction to the 5-amino com~ 7 pound. Because of the great interest in substituted benzimid- 8 azoles as anthelmintic agents, new methods for their synthesis 9 have been sought. In accordance with the present invention, • a new and facile route to 5-amino-2~ substituted benzimidazoles 11 from the corresponding 2- substituted benzimidazoles is pro- 12 vided. 1*3 SUMMARY 14 The object of this invention is to provide a novel method for the preparation of certain 5-amino-2- substituted 16 benzimidazoles. More specifically, a process is provided for 17 the selective nitration of/ a benzimidazole having a 5- 18 membered heteroaromatic radical at the 2- position and optional 19 substitution at the 1~ position. The 5~nitro-2- substituted benzimdiazoles can then be converted to 5~amino-2- substituted 21 benzimidazoles. The process herein involved is described 22 below in more detail. 23 DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 24 The benzimidazoles which can be prepared in accord¬ as ance with the present invention are those having the formula: 1 wherein R represents a S-membered heteroaromatic ring 2 containing from 1-3 hetero atoms of the group N, 0 and S; 3 and represents hydrogen, hydroxy, loweralkyl, or lower- 4 alkoxy. ' 5 It has been found in accordance with this invention 6 that 2- substituted benzimidazoles may be selectively nitrated l 7 in the 5- position without simultaneous nitration of the 8 5- membered heteroaromatic ring in the 2- position of the 9 benzimidazole. One method of achieving nitration is to sus- pend the benzimidazole in glacial acetic acid and then care- 11 fully add a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and glacial 12 acetic acid to the suspension with stirring. The reaction 13 may be carried out at elevated temperatures or at ice bath 14 temperatures; the preferred temperature range, however, is 00-500C. 16 Alternatively, the 2- substituted benzimidazole 17 may be suspended in a freshly prepared mixture of acetic 18 anhydride and concentrated nitric acid. The reaction mixture 19 is stirred for 1-2 hours to ensure complete reaction. The temperature of the reaction mixture is conveniently kept at 21 100-150C., but the reaction may be carried out at temperatures 22 ranging between 0*-25°C. The reaction is quenched by pouring 23 the mixture into ice water, and the product isolated by tech- 24 niques known to one skilled in the art. 1 An additional and preferred method is to dissolve 2 the benzimidazole in concentrated sulfuric acid and add a 3 mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric 4 acid to the sulfuric acid solution. The sulfuric acid serves as a convenient solvent for the benzimidazole as well as a 6 reaction promoter in that it binds the water formed as one 7 of the products of the reaction. The concentrated nitric 8 acid may be added directly to the sulfuric acid benzimidazole 9 solution, but better results are obtained when the nitric acid is diluted with sulfuric acid before the addition. The 11 ratio of nitric acid to sulfuric acid is not critical; it is 12 convenient to employ ratios of from 1-2 to 5-2 parts sulfuric 13 acid to nitric acid. The generally preferred ratio, however, 14 is 3 parts sulfuric acid to 2 parts nitric acid. Good results are obtained at temperatures ranging from -20° to 50oC., but 16 the preferred temperature range is 0<>-300C. When carried out 17 at temperatures above 300C., the reaction tends to form iso- 18 mers of the 5~nitro benzimidazole and thus decreases the yield 19 of the desired product. The reaction is generally allowed to stir for about 10-30 minutes after addition of the acid 21 mixture. This is not an essential feature but is done merely 22 to ensure completeness of the nitration reaction. The reac- 23 tion may then be quenched by pouring the mixture into cold 24 water, preferably ice water. The solid sulfate salt of the 5-nitro benzimidazole may be separated and used directly to 26 form the corresponding 5-amino compound, orthe free amine may 27 be obtained by adding a suitable base such as ammonium hydrox- 28 ide, sodium hydroxide, sodiura carbonate, and the like until 29 the solution is neutral or slightly basic. The solid product 1 is then filtered off and can be purified by techniques known 2 to those skilled in the art. 3 Direct nitration at the 5- position of the 2~ 4 substituted benzimidazoles within the scope of this invention is achieved without concurrent nitration of the 5- membered 6 heteroaromatic substituants in the 2- position. Another 7 important aspect of this process is the fact that nitration 8 occurs essentially only at the 5- position. Some repre- 9 sentative examples of compounds which may be prepared in this fashion are 5-nitro-2-(4 '-thiazolyD-benzimidazole, 1-hydroxy- 11 5-nitro-2-(4'-thiazolyl)-benzimidazole, 5-nitro-2-(3'- 12 thienyl)-benzimidazole, l~methyl-5-nitro-2-(3'-thienyl)- 13 benzimidazole, 5-nitro~2-(2'-thiazolyl)-benzimidazole, 14 5-nitro-2-[4'~(I1,2',3'-thiadiazolyl)]-benzimidazole, 5-nitro- 2-(2,-methyl-4'-thiazolyl)-benzimidazole, 5-nitro-2-(2•- 16 imidazolyl)-benzimidazole, 5-nitro-2-[2'-(1*,3•,4'-thia- 17 diazolyl)]-benz imidazole, l-ethyl-5-nitro-2-(2 *-thiazolyl)- 18 benzimidazole, 5-nitro-2-[4-(1',2',5'-thiadiazolyl)3 - 19 benzimidazole, and 5-nitro-2-(2'-oxazolyl)-benzimidazole. The 5-amino-2- substituted benzimidazoles can be 21 prepared from the corresponding 5-nitro-2- substituted 22 benzimidazoles by reduction of the nitro group in a suitable 23 reducing system. Good conversion to the amine can be achieved 24 through the use of stannous chloride in a hydrochloric acid ' solution or iron powder in dilute acetic acid or dilute hydro- 26 chloric acid. The reduction may also be carried out with 27 sulfides such as sodium sulfide, sodium polysulfide or sodium 28 hydrosulfide. The 5-nitro-2- substituted benzimidazole is 29 refluxed, preferably in water in the presence of sodium 1 hydroxide and the sulfide. The mixture is then acidified 2 to about pH 1 with a dilute mineral acid, such as dilute 3 sulfuric acid, and is then heated to boiling to drive off , 4 hydrogen sulfide. The pH of the solution is then adjusted to about 7; the product is collected by filtration and puri» 6 fied by techniques known to those skilled in the art. The 7 nitro group may be reduced catalytically using hydrogen in 8 the presence of Raney nickel. Solvents such as methanol or r> ethanol are suitable for this type of reduction. The preferred method, however, is to reduce the nitro group catalytically 11 in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dioxane, 12 etc., in the presence of palladium-charcoal or platinum. 13 The catalytic reaction is generally carried out at room 14 temperature and can be done at atmospheric pressure, but the rate of reaction can be accelerated by carrying out the 16 reduction under pressure. Pressures from 35-50 p.s.i. are 17 suitable for such reactions. After removal of the catalyst 18 by filtration and evaporation of the solvent to near dryness, 19 the solid product can be recovered by filtration and is puri- fied by techniques known in. the art. 21 Alternatively, the catalytic reduction can be 22 carried out on a water suspension of the sulfate salt of 23 the 5~nitro-2~ substituted benzimidazole obtained from the 24 nitration reaction over palladium-charcoal, preferably in the presence of about one equivalent of sulfuric acid. 26 Some representative compounds which may be pre- 27 pared in this fashion are 5-amino-2-(4 *-thiazolyl)-benzimid- 28 azole, 5-amino-2-(3'-thienyl)-benzimidazole, S-amino-l- 29 hydroxy-2-(4'-thiazolyl)-benzimidazole, 5-amino-l-methyl- '""iK 1 2-(3*-thienyl)-benziinidazole, 5-ainino-2- ( 2 '-thiwzolyl) - 2 benzimidazole, 5-amino-l-ethy1-2-(2'-thiazolyl)-bsnzimidazole, 3 5-ainino-2- [4 -(!•, 2', 5 '-thiadiazolyl) ] -benzimidazole, 5-. 4 amino-2-(2'-oxazolyl)-benzimidazole, 5-ainino~2- [4 •- (1 ' ,2 • ,3 ' - thiadiazolyl)]-benzimidazole, 5-amino-2-(2-imidazolyl)- 6 benzimidazole, 5-aioino-2- [2 »- (1 • ,3 • ,4 '-thiadiazolyl) ] - 7 benzimidazole, and 5-ainino-2- (2 '-methyl-4 '-thiazolyl)- 8 benzimidazole. 9 The 2- substituted benzimidazoles used as starting materials may be synthesized by methods known in the art. 11 One general procedure is to react an o-phenylenediamine with 12 a heterocyclic carboxylic acid, or derivative thereof, in 13 polyphosphoric acid. 14 The 5-amino-2- substituted benzimidazoles which can be synthesized by this process are active anthelmintics. 16 The group of diseases generally described as helminthiasis 17 is due to infestations of the animal body with parasitic 18 worms known as helminths. Helminthiasis is a prevalent and 19 serious economic problem in domesticated animals such as swine, sheep, cattle, goats, dogs, and poultry. 21 rhe following examples are given for the purpose 22 of illustration and not by way of limitation. 23 Example 1 24 5-NITRO-2-(4'-THIAZOLYL)-BENZIMIDAZOLE t 10 g- of 2-(4'-thiazolyl)-benzimidazole is dissolved 26 with cooling in 20 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid.
