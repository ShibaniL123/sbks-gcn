NEW PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR USE FOR THE TREATMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS The present invention relates to new pharmaceutical compositions and their use for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common causes of neurologic disability in young adults with a huge impact on the quality of life and societal costs. Multiple Sclerosis is an immune-mediated, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease. The etiology is currently unknown and its pathogenesis is only partly understood. Complex genetic traits as well as environmental factors determine the susceptibility to develop the disease. Remarkable progress has been made with regard to Multiple Sclerosis therapeutic treatment. Indeed, many disease-modifying therapies emerged that improve patient outcomes1. Nowadays, humoral immunity is thought to play an important role in the inflammatory response and development of demyelinated lesions. Intrathecal antibody production is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis. Indeed, histopatho logical studies have revealed prominent deposition of immunoglobulins and complement activation in some acute demyelinating lesions2. This group of patients (patients with MS and intrathecal antibody production) experienced a good response to therapeutic plasma exchange. Moreover, the recent identification of lymphoid follicle-like structures in the cerebral meninges of some multiple sclerosis patients indicates that B-cell maturation can be sustained locally within the Central Nervous System (CNS), even if the detrimental or beneficial role of these structures is not yet fully discriminated. Finally, depletion of B cells by therapeutic monoclonal antibody (RituximabÂ® commercialized by Hoffman-La Roche and Genentech) has an effect on inflammatory activity in patients with Multiple Sclerosis3, and recently, antibodies directed against the potassium channel Kir 4.1 has been identified in a large subset of Multiple Sclerosis patients. It would therefore seem that, at least in a subgroup of patients with multiple sclerosis, B cells and antibodies contribute substantially to the disease. Extensive tissue experimentation has also permit to characterize a key function for APRIL at the level of plasma-cell survival in the bone marrow4 and the inflamed mucosa5. A proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL), also known as Tall-1 or TNFSF13, is the last cloned member of the tumor necrosis factor family6. APRIL has two canonical signalling receptors, the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and the transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI)7, almost exclusively expressed by B cells, thus explaining the specific function of APRIL at the level of humoral immunity8. APRIL is produced by myeloid cells9. Quite unique among the TNF superfamily but common for growth factors, heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) constitute coreceptors for APRIL10, rendering the trimeric soluble form of APRIL active for receptor signalling by oligomerization11. As a plasma-cell survival factor, extensive investigations have been carried out worldwide to study the role of APRIL in autoimmunity, including multiple sclerosis. At the level of APRIL expression in Multiple Sclerosis, the cerebrospinal fluids and sera of a small cohort (n=30) of newly diagnosed and untreated patients revealed no APRIL upregulation compared to control non inflammatory neurodegenerative disorders12. In Multiple Sclerosis lesions, it was also reported that astrocytes produce APRIL13. In fact, APRIL is indeed present in Multiple Sclerosis lesions but the authors misconcluded their report. More and more brain functions are devoted to the astrocyte, including structural and metabolic support, blood-brain barrier formation/function, regulation of cerebral blood flow, clearance of neurotransmitters at the synapses, ion balance maintenance and myelination support14. The role of astrocyte in neuro inflammatory diseases has been recently highlighted, notably in neuromyelitis optica (NMO)14. APRIL antagonism in preclinical Multiple Sclerosis has also been tested. In early 2006, a soluble form of BCMA, antagonist of APRIL and the related B-cell activation factor from the TNF family (BAFF) was reported to inhibit murine experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE)15. Recently, an antibody to APRIL was reported to specifically delay induction of EAE in primates16. Both study concluded to a reduction of the immune responses raised against the priming peptide from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) (vaccination with the MOG peptide induces an autoimmune responses conducting to demyelination of nerves in the central nervous system). A big surprise came when such approaches were translated to Multiple Sclerosis patients. The clinical trial ATAMS (ATACICEPT in Multiple Sclerosis) consisted in the treatment of relapsing MS patients with a soluble form of TACI (also an antagonist of BAFF and APRIL). ATACICEPT is a recombinant fusion protein designed to inhibit B cells, thereby suppressing autoimmune disease. Indeed, B-cell depletion was well achieved with ATACICEPT in Multiple Sclerosis patients, but the trial was halted very rapidly due to an unexpected CNS inflammation exacerbation17. Thus, despite remarkable progress with regard to Multiple Sclerosis therapeutic treatment, none seems to be fully efficient. Indeed, continued relapses and eventual disability are still expected in the majority of patients on available therapies. Thus, there is a need for a new treatment of autoimmune disorders, notably Multiple Sclerosis, which is more efficient than those of the prior art. There is also a need for a new prevention of autoimmune disorders, notably Multiple Sclerosis. There is also a need for a new treatment and/or prevention of autoimmune disorders, notably Multiple Sclerosis, which permits to avoid continued relapses and disability for patients with such autoimmune disorders, notably Multiple Sclerosis. That is why, one of the aims of the invention is to provide new pharmaceutical compositions, useful for the prevention and/or treatment of autoimmune disorders, notably Multiple Sclerosis, more efficient than the pharmaceutical compositions used in the prior art. Another aim of the invention is to provide new pharmaceutical compositions, useful for the prevention and/or treatment of autoimmune disorders, notably Multiple Sclerosis, which permits to avoid continued relapses and disability for patients with such autoimmune disorders, notably Multiple Sclerosis. Another aim of the invention is to provide new chimeric proteins, and their use for the prevention and/or treatment of autoimmune disorders, notably Multiple Sclerosis. Thus, the present invention concerns pharmaceutical compositions comprising as an active substance the APRIL protein or a nucleotidic sequence coding for an APRIL protein. The present invention also concerns chimeric proteins comprising an APRIL protein. The present invention also concerns compositions comprising as an active substance the APRIL protein or a nucleotidic sequence coding for an APRIL protein or a chimeric protein comprising an APRIL protein, for its use as a drug. The present invention also concerns compositions comprising as an active substance the APRIL protein or a nucleotidic sequence coding for an APRIL protein or a chimeric protein comprising an APRIL protein, for its use for the manufacture of a drug for the prevention or the treatment of an autoimmune disorder. The present invention also concerns compositions comprising as an active substance the APRIL protein or a nucleotidic sequence coding for an APRIL protein or a chimeric protein comprising an APRIL protein, for its use for the prevention or the treatment of an autoimmune disorder. The invention relies on the unexpected experimental results according to which APRIL may protect mice from experimental autoimmune encephalitis. Moreover, the invention also relies on human studies demonstrating that APRIL is greatly upregulated in lesions from Multiple Sclerosis patients, and that the secreted form of APRIL specifically binds to reactive astrocytes in lesions. The invention also relies on human studies demonstrating that the secreted form of APRIL binds to Chondroitin Sulfate ProteoGlycans (CSPG) in the surrounding astroglial scar rich in the said CSPG (in the extracellular matrice). In this structure, CSPG inhibit neural self- regeneration following trauma in the central nervous system21. In fact, the invention relies on the fact that APRIL may have some neuroprotective activities. More precisely, the invention relies on the fact that APRIL may have some neuroprotective activities by binding to astrocytes and/or by interfering with the anti- regenerative process mediated by CSPG (that is to say by binding to CSPG). Thus, in a first embodiment, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition wherein the active substance comprises or consists in: a protein comprising the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1, representing the APRIL protein, or any derived protein, which is derived from protein of sequence SEQ ID NO: 1 by substitution, removal or addition of one or more amino-acids, provided it allows the binding of the said derived protein to an astrocyte, or any homologous protein, the sequence of which has a percentage of identity of at least approximately 70 %, and in particular 85 % with said sequence SEQ ID NO: 1, provided it allows the binding of the said homologous protein to an astrocyte, or any fragment of the protein of sequence SEQ ID NO: 1, provided it allows the binding of the said fragment to an astrocyte, in association with an acceptable pharmaceutical vehicle. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition wherein the active substance comprises or consists in: a protein comprising the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1, representing the APRIL protein, or any derived protein, which is derived from protein of sequence SEQ ID NO: 1 by substitution, removal or addition of one or more amino-acids, provided it allows the binding of the said derived protein to CSPG, or any homologous protein, the sequence of which has a percentage of identity of at least approximately 70 %, and in particular 85 % with said sequence SEQ ID NO: 1, provided it allows the binding of the said homologous protein to CSPG, or any fragment of the protein of sequence SEQ ID NO: 1, provided it allows the binding of the said fragment to CSPG, in association with an acceptable pharmaceutical vehicle. APRIL protein is a transmembrane protein undergoing cleavage by furin protase in order to be secreted15. Furin protease cleaves before the Alanine at position 88 (see the SEQ ID NO: 3 which is the complete sequence of APRIL protein). Thus, secreted APRIL is from amino acid 88 (an alanine) to amino acid 233 (a leucine). Thus, APRIL part remaining anchored at the membrane after furin processing is from amino acid 1 (a methionine) to amino acid 87 (an arginine). Secreted APRIL and APRIL part remaining anchored at the membrane are shown in Figure 1. SEQ ID NO: 1 is the following sequence in amino acids: HSVLHLVPINATSKDDSDVTEVMWQPALRRGRGLQAQGYGVRIQDAGVYLLYSQV LFQDVTFTMGQVVSREGQGRQETLFRCIRSMPSHPDRAYNSCYSAGVFHLHQGDILS VIIPRARAKLNLSPHGTFLGFVKL SEQ ID NO: 1 corresponds to the secreted APRIL protein, also named APRIL H98 because it is constituted by the sequence from amino acid 98 (a histidine) to amino acid 233 (a leucine) of the sequence of the full-length APRIL protein (see SEQ ID NO: 3). This secreted APRIL protein does not possess HSPG binding domains. HSPG (Heparan Sulphate ProteoGlycans) acts as coreceptor ensuring oligomerization of soluble APRIL to optimally signal via APRIL known receptors (TACI and BCMA). APRIL is as all the TNF like molecules produced as a trimer and the active soluble APRIL is at least a dimer of this trimer. According to the invention, the expression "the sequence of which has a percentage of identity of at least approximately 70 %" means that the percentage of identity can be 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%. Astrocytes are characteristic star-shaped glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. They are the most abundant cells of the human brain and they perform many functions such as structural and metabolic support, blood-brain barrier formation/function, regulation of cerebral blood flow, clearance of neurotransmitters at the synapses, ion balance maintenance and myelination support. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) are proteoglycans consisting of a protein core and a chondroitin sulfate side chain. They are structural components of a variety of human tissues, including cartilage. They also play key roles in neural development and glial scar formation. Notably, CSPG are known to inhibit axon regeneration after spinal cord injury, and they are known to contribute to glial scar formation post injury, acting as a barrier against new axons growing into the injury site. CSPG are also ligands for the inhibitory receptors: NogoRl, NogoR3 and protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma. APRIL can bind to one or several CSPG in central nervous system (CNS), including aggrecan, brevican, neurocan, phosphocan, keratane sulfate proteoglycan, neurone-glial antigen2. APRIL has the potential to bind to all these CSPG. An acceptable pharmaceutical vehicle can be any kind of physiological solutions. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition wherein the active substance comprises or consists in: a protein comprising the sequence SEQ ID NO: 2, representing the APRIL protein, or any derived protein, which is derived from protein of sequence SEQ ID NO: 2 by substitution, removal or addition of one or more amino-acids, provided it allows the binding of the said derived protein to an astrocyte, or any homologous protein, the sequence of which has a percentage of identity of at least approximately 70 %, and in particular 85 % with said sequence SEQ ID NO: 2, provided it allows the binding of the said homologous protein to an astrocyte, or any fragment of the protein of sequence SEQ ID NO: 2, provided it allows the binding of the said fragment to an astrocyte, in association with an acceptable pharmaceutical vehicle. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition wherein the active substance comprises or consists in: a protein comprising the sequence SEQ ID NO: 2, representing the APRIL protein, or any derived protein, which is derived from protein of sequence SEQ ID NO: 2 by substitution, removal or addition of one or more amino-acids, provided it allows the binding of the said derived protein to CSPG, or any homologous protein, the sequence of which has a percentage of identity of at least approximately 70 %, and in particular 85 % with said sequence SEQ ID NO: 2, provided it allows the binding of the said homologous protein to CSPG, - or any fragment of the protein of sequence SEQ ID NO: 2, provided it allows the binding of the said fragment to CSPG, in association with an acceptable pharmaceutical vehicle. SEQ ID NO: 2 is the following sequence in amino acids: AVLTO OK OHSVLHLVPINATSKDDSDVTEVMWOPALRRGRGLOAQGYGVRIOD AGVYLLYSQVLFQDVTFTMGQVVSREGQGRQETLFRCIRSMPSHPDRAYNSCYSA GVFHLHQGDILSVIIPRARAKLNLSPHGTFLGFVKL SEQ ID NO: 2 corresponds to the secreted APRIL protein which possess an HSPG binding domain which is KQKKQH. Secreted APRIL protein which possesses an HSPG binding domain is also named APRIL Ass because it is constituted by the sequence from amino acid 88 (an alanine) to amino acid 233 (a leucine) of the sequence of the full-length APRIL protein (see SEQ ID NO: 3) HSPG binding domain is situated among the first ten amino acids of the SEQ ID NO: 2. It is underlined in SEQ ID NO: 2. Thus, SEQ ID NO: 2 contains only the following supplementary amino acids in comparison with SEQ ID NO: 1 (AVLTQKQK Q). A test for checking the binding between the secreted APRIL protein and an astrocyte can be the following test: Immunostain CRT-MG astrocytes with Fc control and Fc-APRILAss (1 Î¼g ml) or control Fas-Fc (1 Î¼g/ml) for 30 minutes at 4 C in PBS 1% BSA ; Wash cells ; Incubate cells with Alexa488-conjugated human Ig antiserum for another 30 minutes at 4Â° C ; Wash cells ; - Resuspend in PBS ; Analyse fluorescence with the LSRII Becton Dickinson flow cytometer. CRT-MG is a human astrocyte cell line. Fc-APRILAs8 is the fragment of secreted APRIL which begins at amino acid A88 (an alanine) of the sequence of the full-length APRIL protein (see SEQ ID NO: 3) linked with a Fc fragment from a human immunoglobulin. This link is carried out by genetic engineering. That is why this link it is a covalent bound. Fas-Fc is used here as an irrelevant control for putative binding via Fc receptors. The extracellular domain of Fas was linked to the same Fc fragment. A test for checking the binding between APRIL and CSPG can be the following test: - Preincubate Fc-APRILAss (1 Î¼g ll) with or without CSPG for 30 minutes at 4 C in PBS 1% BSA ; Immunostain CRT-MG astrocytes for 30 minutes at 4Â°C ; Wash cells ; Incubate cells with Alexa488-conjugated human Ig antiserum for another 30 minutes at 4 C ; Wash cells ; Resuspend in PBS ; Analyse fluorescence with the LSRII Becton Dickinson flow cytometer.

EXAMPLES The following examples have been carried out according to the experimental procedures hereafter described. Example 1: APRIL expression in multiple sclerosis (MS) patient lesions - Human Studies The first tissue-reactive antibodies against human APRIL have been generated, as explained in Schwaller et ah, Blood, vol 109, pp 331-337, 2007. APRIL is a transmembrane protein undergoing cleavage by furin proteases in order to be secreted18. Antibodies which link to the two parts of the protein after cleavage are known. Indeed, one antibody, Aprily-8, reacts with the secreted product and another one, Stalk- 1 , reacts with the APRIL part remaining anchored at the membrane of producing cells after furin processing (see Figure 1). Enzo Life Sciences distributes these antibodies. There is no full-length product detected by this antibody pair in tissues9, probably because of a fast processing after translation, so that Aprily-8 detects the localisation of secreted APRIL only and does not react with APRIL-producing cells. 1. Immunohistochemistry (Stalk- l/Aprily-8) Material & Methods Serial sections form biopsies of the indicated patients were fixed, paraffin-embedded and subjected to immunostaining with Stalk- 1 (5 Î¼g/ml, rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing cells producing APRIL) and Aprily-8 (2 Î¼g/ml, mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the secreted form of APRIL). Indicated patients are patients with Multiple Sclerosis (upper panel) and patients with Parkinson disease (bottom panel). Tissues were washed, and incubated with a biotin-conjugated rabbit and mouse Ig antiserum, respectively. Tissues were washed, and incubated with horse raddish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin. Tissue were washed and incubated with the HRP substrate amino ethyl courmarin. Light microscopy was analyzed with an Axiocam microscope (Carl Zeiss). Pictures from a relevant case of an inflammatory (multiple sclerosis, MS) and a noninflammatory (Parkinson disease) neurodegenerative disease are shown. Results A perilesional production of APRIL and a lesional retention of the secreted product have been observed in multiple sclerosis (Figure 2, upper panel). By contrast, APRIL expression has not been detected in non-inflammatory disorders such as Parkinson diseases (Figure 2, bottom panel). This pattern of APRIL expression has been observed in a majority of multiple sclerosis patients (16/17) with a trend towards expression in progressive and/or acute forms of the disease (see below the Table 1).

Two-color immunohistofluorescence (Stalk- l/anti-CD68 _ anti-GFAP/ Aprily-8) Material & Methods Serial sections from biopsy of the same MS patient (as previously mentioned) was immunostained with Stalk-1 (rabbit polyclonal antibody) and an anti-CD68 (macrophage /microglial-specific mouse antibody) (upper panel). The same biopsy was immunostained with an anti-GFAP (astrocyte-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody) and Aprily-8 (mouse antibody) (bottom panel). Tissues were washed and binding was detected with an alexa488-conjugated anti- rabbit serum (green) and a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse serum (red). Fluorescence was analyzed with an Axiocam microscope (Carl Zeiss). Single and merged pictures are shown. Nuclear (DAPI) staining is shown in the merge pictures. Results Unlike what has been reported (Reference13 for example), in the lesions of multiple sclerosis, APRIL is produced by a subset of CD68+ cells that could be either microglia or infiltrating macrophages, and the secreted product from these cells binds specifically onto surrounding reactive astrocytes (Figure 3). The conclusion of the prior art claiming APRIL production by astrocytes in MS is misleading. In fact, it seems that the authors of reference13 used the monoclonal antibody against secreted APRIL used in the present invention, obtained an identical staining on reactive astrocytes, but misconcluded on the cellular source of APRIL. Thus, CD68+ cells are cells which express the Cluster of Differentiation 68. GFAP is a Glial Fibrilary Acidic Protein which is expressed by the astrocytes. 3. Immunohistochemistry (Aprily-8) Material & Methods A biopsy from a MS patient (as previously mentioned) was immunostained with Aprily-8 (2 Î¼g/ml, mouse IgGl recognizing the secreted form of human APRIL). Tissues were washed, and incubated with a biotin-conjugated mouse Ig antiserum (available at Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Tissues were washed, and incubated with horse raddish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (available at Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) Tissue were washed and incubated with the HRP substrate amino ethyl courmarin. Light microscopy was analyzed with an Axiocam microscope (provided by Carl Zeiss). Results Secreted APRIL is retained by astrocytes present in lesions but also by the surrounding extracellular matrix rich in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) (Figure 9). This also confirms the results of Figure 2 and Figure 3. Example 2: Role of APRIL in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Plasmocytes have not been observed in the lesions used to stain for APRIL (CD 138 staining, data not shown). The Multiple Sclerosis lesions used were also devoid of ectopic germinal centers reported by others19. Altogether, this indicates that APRIL may play locally a new unpreviously described role in Multiple Sclerosis. To elucidate the putative function of APRIL in Multiple Sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) are performed in C57B1/6 mice. Material & Methods EAE was induced by MOG35-55 peptide immunization in wild-type mice (WT) or mice genetically deficient in APRIL (APRIL KO (knock-out) C57B1/6 mice. Wild type and ^4 i?H-deficient C57B1/6 mice were vaccinated against the MOG peptide35-55 to induce a MOG-specific CD8+ T cell autoimmune responses. Clinical score and neuropathy-induced death were monitored. At the peak of the disease, spleens were harvested, dissociated, and total splenocytes were stimulated by increasing concentrations of the MOG peptide. Proliferation was assessed three days later by tritiated thymidine incorporation. * p<0.01 Results The clinical score (left panel) and death induced by EAE pathologies (right panel) are shown in Figure 4. The results show that in mice genetically deficient in APRIL the clinical EAE score was increased: for example at 19 days, the clinical score is 2 with the wild-type mice (WT) and 3 with the APRIL KO C57BI/6 mice (APRIL KO). The results also show that the percent death of mouse death induced by EAE associated pathologies is increased in mice genetically deficient in APRIL: for example at 20 days, the percentage is 11% for the wild-type mice (WT) and 40% for APRIL KO C57BI/6 mice (APRIL KO). Moreover, in this experiment, no differences in proportion and number of immune cells (myeloid, B and T cells) present in the periphery (spleen and bone marrow) and the affected spinal cord have been detected. There was also no difference in the immunological responses between the two mice groups induced against the MOG peptide used for animal priming (splenic T-cell proliferation, Figure 5). This absence of immunological differences is not a big surprise, since a T-cell immune response is induced by MOG peptide immunization, and APRIL role focuses on B-cell responses8. This suggests that APRIL may be implicated in a neuroprotective pathway. Example 3: Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with APRIL Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis (EAE) is an accepted murine model for human MS20. Material & Methods EAE was induced at day 0 in 8 weeks female C57B1/6 mice by injecting subcutaneously in both flanks 0.1 ml of an emulsion composed of 1 volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (available at Sigma) supplemented with 4 mg/ml of a Mycobacterium Tuberculosis lysate (available at Difco Laboratories) and 1 volume of 2.5 mg/ml of peptide 35-55 from the rat myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (available at Polypeptide Group). Immediately after, 500 ng of Bordetella Pertussis toxin in PBS was injected intraperitoneally. Toxin injection was repeated on day 1. The clinical score was evaluated as followed: 0 : no sign 1 : limp tail 2 : limp tail associated to walking disability without any limb paralysis 3 : limp tail and partial hind limb paralysis 4 : limp tail and complete hind limb paralysis 5 : limp tail, complete hind limb paralysis and partial anterior limb paralysis 6 : moribund state conducting to animal sacrifice Mice suffering from EAE with a clinical score of 2 were treated by intravenous injections of 50 Î¼g of Fc- APRIL A88 in PBS every other day. Results APRIL treatment induces a decline in the clinical score of EAE Mice (Figure 11). Consequently, APRIL treatment may inhibit the neurodegenerative process occurring during MS? Example 4: Determination of APRIL receptor(s) on astrocytes Material & Methods CRT-MG astrocytes were immunostained with Fc-control and Fc-APRIL, then analysed by flow cytometry. CRT-MG astrocytes were immunostained with Fc-APRIL Î88 (1 Î¼Â§/Î·Î¹1, bold lines) or control Fas-Fc (1 Î¼g/ml, thin lines) for 30 minutes at 4 C in PBS 1% BSA. Cells were washed, and incubated with Alexa488-conjugated human Ig antiserum for another 30 mn at 4 C. Cells were washed again, resuspended in PBS and fluorescence was analyzed with the LSRII Becton Dickinson flow cytometer. CRT-MG is a human astrocyte cell line. Results Overlayed histogram plots are shown. The thin lines represent CRT-MG astrocytes immunostained with Fc-control. The bold lines represent CRT-MG astrocytes immunostained with Fc-APRIL. The results confirm in vitro binding of a soluble form of APRIL (April Ass) onto the human astrocyte cells CRT (Figure 6). Example 5: APRIL bind to CSPG Material & Methods CRT-MG astrocytes were immunostained with 50 Î¼Î of supernatant conditonned by 293-T cells mock transfected (control supernatant) or transfected with Flag-tagged megaAPRIL A88 (APRIL). APRIL was pre-incubated 15 minutes at 4Â°C in medium alone or with 200 Î¼g/ml of CSPG type B (available at Sigma) before being added onto cells. Cells were washed and incubated with an anti Flag (1 Î¼g/ml, clone M2, avaialable at Sigma) conjugated to biotin for 30 minutes at 4Â°C. Cells were washed and incubated with streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin (1/300, available at Becton Dickinson). Cells were washed, resuspended in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results Overlayed histograms are shown. Grey line corresponds to control. Black line corresponds to APRIL. Black dashed line corresponds to APRIL pre-incubated with CSPG. The results confirm that the inhibition mediated by CSPG (Chondroitin Sulfate ProteoGlycan) revealed the capacity of APRIL to interact with CSPG (Figure 10). Example 6: APRIL recombinant forms to be tested Several forms of recombinant APRIL are planned to be tested. Indeed, APRIL has a domain binding to HSPG. HSPG acts as coreceptor ensuring oligomerization of soluble APRIL to optimally signal via APRIL known receptors (TACI and BCMA). HSPG binding may trap the injected recombinant APRIL at undesired places, such as endothelial cells lining blood vessels. This has been already observed with other HSPG- binding recombinant proteins. Hence, recombinant natural APRIL with or without the HSPG biding domain will be tested. Recombinant natural APRIL with or without the HSPG biding domain are shown in Figure 7. Sequence FLAG can be used for the purification step and does not belong to the active protein or the active fragment of the protein according to the present invention. In the case a recombinant form without the HSPG binding domain is retained, an artificially oligomerize recombinant soluble APRIL with fusion partners may needed (see Figure 8). As explained below, the sequence FLAG can be used for the purification step and does not belong to the active protein or the active fragment of the protein according to the present invention. The two fusions partners retained for the study are a constant part of a human immunoglobulin (Fc) and the headless portion of the adipocyte complement related protein of 30 kDa (ACRP30). This latter chimeric APRIL is called Mega- APRIL. Generation of Fc- and Mega-recombinant proteins have been described in Holler N., et al, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Feb. 2003, p. 1428-1440. Both chimeric molecules have been shown to signal via TACI and BCMA in the absence of the HSPG binding domain. Example 7: Best injection route for recombinant APRIL Pursuant to the results of Example 2 and Example 3, the best injection route for recombinant APRIL to distribute in brain lesions from EAE mice is tested. After technetium labeling, 50 Î¼g of the different recombinant forms of APRIL are injected in EAE mice. The recombinant forms of APRIL usedf are notably the forms described in example 6. In vivo distribution of recombinant APRIL is monitored non-invasively by nuclear imaging, followed by invasive immunohistochemistry to localize the binding of recombinant APRIL in mouse brain lesions. Three different routes are tested: intravenous, intranasal and intracerebroventricular. Once the best route for APRIL brain biodistribution is determined, EAE mice are treated before disease induction (mice harboring a clinical score of 0), and once the disease is induced (mice harboring a clinical score of 1-2) O. lmg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg of recombinant APRIL are injected every two, three and seven days. Daily evolution of the clinical score in treated mice is monitored. For treated mice having recovered from EAE and showing a stable low clinical score over a week, disease reinduction is performed (according to the same protocol as induction described in Example 2 and in Example 3. The subsequent increase in the clinical score is followed daily. This test permits to determine whether APRIL treatment during the primary disease phase is able to diminish secondary phases, knowing that human MS is a chronic progressive disease.
