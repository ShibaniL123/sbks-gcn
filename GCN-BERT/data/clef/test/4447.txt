Step 2:
benzyl 5-(isobutyryl)-3,3-dimethyl-4-oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate
At 0°C, to a solution of benzyl 3,3-dimethyl 4-oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate (6.00 g, 22.96 mmol, 1.00 equivalent) in toluene (150.00 mL) was added LDA (2M , 22.96 mL, 2.00 equivalents) in one portion. After the reaction mixture was stirred at this temperature for 30 minutes, isobutyryl chloride (3.67 g, 34.44 mmol, 1.50 equivalents) was added, and then the resulting mixture was slowly warmed to 30 °C and stirred for 16 hours. TLC (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 6: 1) showed completion of the reaction. The reaction mixture was quenched with a solution of ammonium chloride (80 mL) and then subjected to extraction using ethyl acetate (100 mL×2). The organic phases were combined, concentrated and dried. The obtained crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 50: 1) to give the title compound (5.60 g, 16.90 mmol, 73.60% yield) as a yellow oil.
