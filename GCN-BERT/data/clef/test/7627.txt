CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a Divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/524,568, filed Jun. 15, 2012, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/497,754, filed Jun. 16, 2011, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD The present application relates to a process for selectively producing single-isomer benzoprostacyclin derivatives including beraprost and its derivatives. The present invention also relates to a novel process for attaching the alpha side-chain to single-isomer key intermediate leading to beraprost and related derivatives. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Prostacyclin derivatives are useful pharmaceutical compounds possessing activities such as platelet aggregation inhibition, gastric secretion reduction, lesion inhibition, and bronchodilation. Beraprost is a synthetic benzoprostacyclin analogue of natural prostacyclin that is currently under clinical trials for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and vascular disease (excluding renal disease) in North America and Europe. Beraprost and related benzoprostacyclin analogues of the formula (I) are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,202,447 and Tetrahedron Lett. 31, 4493 (1990). Furthermore, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,345,181, several synthetic methods are known to produce benzoprostacyclin analogues. Known synthetic methods generally require one or more resolutions of intermediates to obtain the pharmacologically active isomer of beraprost or a related benzoprostacyclin analogue. Also, current pharmaceutical formulations of beraprost or a related benzoprostacyclin analogues may consist of several isomers of the pharmaceutical compound, and only one of which is primarily responsible for the pharmacologic activity of the drug. Isolation of the pharmaceutically active isomer of beraprost compounds from current synthetic methods requires multiple preparative HPLC or chromatographic purification procedures or multiple recrystallizations that are not amenable to a commercially applicable scale. Therefore, it is desired to achieve an efficient, commercially applicable synthetic route to the active isomer of beraprost or a related benzoprostacyclin analogue. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a method which can produce the pharmaceutical compound represented by the general formula (I) in a substantially isomerically pure form, in fewer steps than the prior art and in commercially useful quantities.

One aspect of the invention is a synthetic method for synthesizing Beraprost (314d) or a related analogue, such as a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof from a Corey Lactone, such as a compound represented by Formula (II) In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for making a substantially pure isomer of beraprost or its related derivatives of the following formula (I): wherein R1 represents a cation, H, or C1-12 alkyl, R2 and R3 each represent H or a hydroxy protective group, R4 represents H or C1-3 alkyl, and R5 represents H or C1-6 alkyl, comprising: (1) performing a cycloaddition reaction between a compound of the following formula: wherein in R2a and R6 independently represent hydroxy protecting groups or H, and a compound of the following formula: wherein R7 represents C1-6 alkoxy or C1-12 alkyl-COOR9, where R9 represents C1-3 alkyl, and R8 represents halide or H to form a compound of the following formula: wherein R2a, R6, R7, and R8 are each defined above; (2) aromatizing the cyclodiene compound of formula (IV) to form the aromatic product of the following formula: (3) reducing the ester of the compound of formula (V) to a benzyl alcohol and oxidation of benzyl alcohol to an aldehyde followed by addition of a carbon to said aldehyde to form an alkyne resulting in a compound of the following formula: (4) coupling the terminal alkyne with N2CH2CO2R1a, wherein R1a represents a C1-12 alkyl followed by hydrogenation of the alkyne to its corresponding alkane to form a compound of the following formula: (5) selectively deprotecting the primary hydroxyl protective group, followed by oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group to the corresponding aldehyde, followed by coupling with a side-chain of the formula: wherein R4 and R5 are each defined above and (VIII) is substantially a single isomer to form a compound of the following formula: (6) reduction of the ketone, deprotection of any remaining hydroxy protective group and optionally converting the R1a into a cation or H to form a compound of the following formula: In the present invention, the single pharmacologically active isomer of beraprost corresponds to the 314-d isomer of beraprost or its corresponding salt or other pharmaceutically useful related derivative, such as for example, prodrug or solvate. This 314-d isomer compound is represented by the compound of formula (I) wherein R1 is a cation or H, R2 and R3 are H, R4 and R5 are CH3. In one embodiment, R2a and R6 independently represent hydroxy protecting groups and are different protecting groups. In one embodiment, R2a is a silyl protecting group, such as for example, trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, phenyldimethylsilyl. Additional silyl protecting groups are recited in Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, and are incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, R6 is a protecting group that is capable of protecting a primary alcohol without reacting with a secondary alcohol, such as for example a trityl group. Additional R6 protecting groups meeting this requirement may be found in Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, and are incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, the cycloaddition of step (1) may be achieved with an inverse electron demand Diels Alder reaction followed by thermal decarboxylation to form endo and exo isomers. The subsequent aromatization to compound (V) eliminates said isomers. In one embodiment, aromatization may be achieved by dehydrogenation, for example, palladium on carbon may be utilized to convert the diene of compound (IV) into the aromatic moiety of compound (V). The reduction of the ketone in step (6) may be achieved using a non-selective reducing agent, such as for example, sodium borohydride with cerium trichloride heptahydrate, and the subsequent diastereomers separated, or alternatively a chiral reducing agent capable of selectively reducing the ketone may be used to obtain substantially one isomer of the resulting alcohol. Selective reducing agents are known in the art and include, for example: (R)-(+)-2-Butyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine and catecholborane, (R)-(+)-2-Methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine and catecholborane, (+) DIP-chloride, NaBH4 and 2-(3-Nitrophenyl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolane-4S,5S-dicarboxylic acid (D-TarB-NO2), modified DIBAL reagents, and modified LAH agents. In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is produced as the single isomer represented by formula (I) and in substantially isomerically pure form. In one embodiment, the product represented by formula (I) comprises 90% of the resulting isomeric mixture, or preferably 95% of the resulting isomeric mixture, or more preferably 98% of the resulting isomeric mixture, or even more preferably 99% of the resulting isomeric mixture, and most preferably above 99% of the resulting isomeric mixture. In another embodiment of this invention is a method comprising steps (1) through (4) followed by deprotection of any alcohol protection groups to yield compound of formula (VII) wherein R2a and R6 are H and R1a is methoxy. This compound is isolated as substantially one isomer represented by the compound of formula (VII). Another aspect of the present invention provides a novel method that can attach the alpha side-chain to single-isomer key intermediate leading to the pharmaceutical compound represented by the general formula (I). The novel process provides for producing the four-carbon alpha side-chain of beraprost or its related derivatives from the core intermediate ester of the compound of formula (V) comprising conversion of the compound of formula (V) to a benzyl alcohol of formula (X) followed by oxidation of benzyl alcohol to an aldehyde of formula (XII) followed by addition of a carbon to said aldehyde to form an alkyne compound of formula (VI). One skilled in the art would appreciate that extension of the alpha side-chain may proceed from the benzyl alcohol of formula (X) by conversion of the alcohol to a leaving group such as R10 of the formula (XI) followed by nucleophilic displacement. Furthermore, a Wittig or similar type reaction may be used to couple a side chain to the benzyl aldehyde of formula (XII). In another embodiment, analogues of the single-isomer key intermediate may include an alpha side-chain of more than four carbons. For example Scheme 1 demonstrates that the benzyl alcohol of formula (X) can be converted to the compound of formula (XI) followed by nucleophilic displacement resulting in (XIII). In another embodiment, the aldehyde of formula (XII) may be subjected to a Wittig-type reaction to produce a compound of formula (XIII). In a further embodiment, the aldehyde of formula (VI) may be converted to a compound of formula (XIII) by methods known in the art or analogous to methods disclosed herein. wherein in R2a and R6 independently represent hydroxy protecting groups and R10 to R12 are defined above, and may be optionally substituted with one or more functional groups. A compound of formula (XIII) can be subjected to steps (5) and (6) to produce additional beraprost analogues. Another aspect of this invention relates the side-chain coupling and variations on said side-chain, the trans-alkene of beraprost and its derivatives is achieved through Wadworth-Emmons-type reaction. The side-chain is produced as substantially a single isomer. Synthesis of the side-chain coupling product of the formula (VIII) may be achieved from a single isomer Weinreb amide compound of the following formula: wherein R4 and R5 are each defined above. Furthermore, the compound of formula (XIV) may be synthesized according to reagents known in the art from a compound of the formula (XV) by deprotonation and subsequent selective addition to an compound with a suitable leaving group, such as for example compound (XVI). resulting in the compound: The compound of formula (XVII) may be converted to a compound of formula (XIV) by methods known in the art. Compound (XIV) may subsequently be converted in to a compound of the formula (VIII) by methods analogous to those disclosed herein. Furthermore, another embodiment of this invention includes manipulation of the side chain coupling product as shown in Scheme 2. Variation of the side-chain allows additional analogues of beraprost to be explored. In one embodiment, the compound of the formula (XV) may be reacted with a compound of the formula (XVIII), wherein R13 is C1-12 allyl, C1-12 alkene, C1-12 alkyne, C1-12 cyclo alkyl, C1-12 cyclo alkene, or C1-12 cyclo alkyne, and further manipulated by methods analogous to those disclosed herein or known in the art to form a Weinreb amide of formula (XIX). The methods for these reactions are analogous to those for the production of compound (XIV) or are known in the art. A compound of the formula (XIX) may then be converted into a coupling product suitable for Wadworth-Emmons-type coupling analogous to compound of formula (VIII). The resulting coupling product may be coupled with a compound suitable for Wadworth-Emmons-type coupling disclosed herein, for example a compound of the formula (VII) that has been selectively deprotected at the primary hydroxyl protective group, followed by oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group to the corresponding aldehyde. wherein R4 and R13 are previously defined. In one embodiment, X is H. In another embodiment, X is Ph. Additional moieties, such as analogues of Ph and other aryl, heteroaryl or alkyl moieties may also serve as X.

Additional embodiments include side-chain compounds represented by the structures wherein R4, R5 and R13 are previously defined and the chiral purity is 97 percent or more, or 99 percent or more. A preferred embodiment includes compounds represented by the structures wherein the chiral purity is 97 percent or more, or 99 percent or more. Side-chain compounds may be produced by the methods described herein, including the exemplary methods shown in FIG. 1 The present invention is further illustrated by, though in no way limited to, the following examples.

A solution of t-butyldimethyl trifluoromethane sulfonate (37.4 mL) in dichloromethane (50 mL) was added to the reaction mixture drop-wise, while keeping the temperature between −10° C. to −20° C. over a period of 20-40 minutes. After complete addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm-up to ambient temperature. After 2-4 h, the progress of the reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo to obtain a crude product. The crude product was chased with MTBE to remove dichloromethane completely. The crude product was dissolved in MTBE (100-150 mL) and washed with water (1×100 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate (1×100 mL), brine (1×150 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (10 g), and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated in vacuo to a afford crude, viscous liquid (30.4 g). The crude product was purified by column chromatography using 230-400 mesh silica gel. A solvent gradient of ethyl acetate in hexanes (2-12%) was used to elute the product from the column. All fractions containing the desired product were combined and concentrated in vacuo to give pure product (2) as a white solid (20.8 g, 89.4%). Preparation of (3) A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, a thermocouple and an argon inlet-outlet adapter connected to a bubbler was charged with intermediate 2 (20.0 g), and toluene (200 mL). The temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained at −50° C. to −70° C. under nitrogen using dry-ice-acetone bath. While maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture at −50° C. to −70° C., diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL, 60 mL, 1.0M in toluene) was added drop wise during 20-30 minutes. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. The reaction mixture was quenched with methanol (10 mL) at −20° C., water (300 mL), followed by addition of diluted hydrochloric acid (˜20%). The organic layer was separated and aqueous layer was extracted with MTBE (2×100 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate (1×150 mL), brine (1×150 mL) and, dried over sodium sulfate (10 g). The organic layer was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo, to give a yellow, viscous oil (20.4 g). The crude product was used as such in the next step.

After complete addition, the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. The temperature of the reaction mixture was allowed to warm-up to ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 2-4 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo to obtain crude product. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using 230-400 mesh silica gel and eluted with a gradient solvent of ethyl acetate in hexanes (0-10%). The fractions containing the desired product were combined and evaporated in vacuo to afford intermediate 4 (as a viscous liquid, 11 g). Preparation of (6) A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, and an argon inlet-outlet trap was charged with a solution of intermediate (4, 10.0 g), dichloroethane (DCE, 100-150 mL), compound 5 (2.6 g), and Eu(hfc)3 (1.4 g) at room temperature under argon. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to reflux for 1.0 h and the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC in order to ensure that starting material 5 has been consumed completely. After 1.0 h, the temperature of the reaction was reduced below reflux temperature and compound 5 (1.0 g) was added to the reaction mixture. The temperature of the reaction was increased to reflux. In a similar manner, after half an hour, compound 5 (0.9 g) was added and the reaction was continuously refluxed again. When the TLC of the reaction mixture indicated almost complete consumption of intermediate 4, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum to give a residual viscous liquid. The brown, viscous liquid was chased with toluene and dissolved in toluene (100-150 mL). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux again for 6-8 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction, it was concentrated in vacuo to obtain the crude product 6 as a viscous oil. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using 230-400 mesh silica gel and eluted with a gradient solvent of ethyl acetate in hexanes (4-40%). The fractions containing the desired product were combined and concentrated in-vacuo to yield the intermediate 6, as a colorless, viscous oil (9.87 g, 77%).

The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, and the reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite. The filtrate was concentrated in-vacuo to yield crude product 7, as a viscous liquid. The crude product 7 was purified by column chromatography using 230-400 mesh silica gel. A solvent gradient of ethyl acetate in hexanes (0-15%) was used to elute the product from the column.

The reaction mixture was cooled to −25° C. to −50° C., and diisobutylaluminium hydride solution (DIBAL, 16.60 mL, 1.0M in toluene) was added drop-wise, while keeping the temperature of the reaction mixture between −25° C. to −50° C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1-2 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. The reaction mixture was quenched with methanol (2-4 mL), followed by acidification with dilute hydrochloric acid (20%, 50 mL). The organic layer was separated and aqueous layer was extracted with MTBE (2×50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate (1×50 mL), brine (1×50 mL), and dried over sodium sulfate (10 g). The organic layer was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo, to give a viscous oil (8, 3.73 g). The crude product 8 was used as such in next step.

To this solution was added a solution of oxazolidinone (36 gin 50-80 mL of THF) drop wise at −78° C. After the mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 60-120 min, 1-iodo-2-butyne (freshly prepared in THF in step one) was added drop wise at −78° C. over a period of 45-60 min using a dropping funnel. The mixture was stirred for 2 h, and then quenched the reaction mixture with acetic acid (11 mL) at −78° C. The mixture was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and aqueous sodium chloride (500-750 mL) was added. The organic layer was separated from the aqueous layer. The aqueous phase was extracted with MTBE (3×400 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with aqueous NaHCO3 (100 mL), then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, followed by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to ⅕th of the total volume. Ethanol (150 mL) was added and the mixture concentrated in vacuo to a slurry. An additional amount of ethanol (200 mL) was added and then concentrated again in vacuo to a slurry in order to remove other solvents carried over from reaction and work-up. Crystallization: To the resulting slurry, ethanol 300-350 mL was added and mixture was heated to obtain a clear solution. The clear solution was allowed to cool slowly to ambient temperature. The resulting solid was collected by filtration and washed with a solution of ethanol in hexanes (50%, 50-150 mL). The solid product was transferred to glass tray and air-dried to afford white, crystalline oxazolidinone (24.74 g, 59%), mp 128-130° C. Example 7 Synthesis of Phosphonate Side Chain Step 1: A 500-mL, round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer was charged with a solution of oxazolidinone 8 (24.50 g) in THF (295 mL), water (114 mL) and LiOH (2.273 g). The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 16-24 h. A saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (50-75 mL) was added to the reaction mixture slowly while stirring. The reaction mixture was extracted with MTBE (5×100 mL) to remove the chiral auxiliary and impurities. The aqueous layer was adjusted to pH 3-4 by addition of dilute hydrochloric acid and extracted with MTBE (3×150 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (1×150 mL), and then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, followed by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to give crude carboxylic acid (6.4 g, 74.5%). Step 2: A 500-mL, round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer was charged with carboxylic acid (10) (6.35 g), 2-chloro-4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazine (11.93 g), and N-methylmorpholine (14.6 mL) in THF (70-100 mL). The suspension was stirred at ambient temperature for 1-2 h. After stirring for 1-2 h, MeO(Me)NH.HCl (5.89 g) was added and the mixture stirred at RT overnight (16-18 h). To the reaction mixture, hexane (50-100 mL) was added. The slurry was filtered through a pad of Celite. The Celite bed was washed with hexanes (50-100 mL). The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to afford crude amide (11). The crude product was dissolved in hexane (50-100 mL) and filtered again through a pad of Celite in order to remove suspended solid impurities. The Celite bed was washed with hexanes (50-100 mL). The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to afford crude product. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (gradient: EtOAc/hexanes, 5-25%) to afford Weinreb amide (7.2 g, 85%) as a colorless oil with a 98.42% purity (by chiral HPLC). Step 3: A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and an argon inlet-outlet adapter connected to a bubbler was charged with a solution of dimethyl methylphosphonate (A) (13.00 g) in THF (50 mL) followed by drop wise addition of n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexanes, 52.50 mL) at −78° C. using a dropping funnel. The mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 1 h and then a solution of amide 11 (7.10 g) in THF (20-30 mL) was added over a period of 30-45 minutes using a dropping funnel. After complete addition, the mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 2 h, then the reaction was quenched with aqueous NH4Cl (100 mL). The mixture was allowed to warm-up to ambient temperature. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×75 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (1×50 mL), then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, followed by the filtration. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to afford crude product. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (gradient, EtOAc/hexanes, 10-100%) to afford (S)-3-methyl-2-oxohept-5-ynylphosphonic acid dimethyl ester (9.218 g, 95%).
