SALTS OF 2-CHLORO-N-(4-CHLORO-3-(PYRIDIN-2-YL)PHENYL)-4-(METHYLSULFONYL)BENZAMIDE Field of the invention The invention relates to new solid forms of vismodegib (2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2- yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide) free base and salts of vismodegib of Formula I: and at least one acid component wherein the salt of Formula I and acid component is presented in amorphous or crystalline form. The invention also relates to processes of preparation of free bases and salts as well as to their use in pharmaceutical compositions. Use of solid forms of vismodegib and manufactured salts in the preparation of 2-chloro-N-(4- chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide in the free form or in the form of any pharmaceutical salt thereof is also part of the invention. Background of the invention 2-Chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide which is also known as vismodegib (CAS no. 879085-55-9) is an active pharmaceutical compound for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Basal cell carcinoma is a slow-growing form of skin- cancer and it belongs to the group of nonmelanoma-type skin cancer. Vismodegib is used for the treatment of adults with basal cell carcinoma in advanced stages, e.g. when the cancer is metastatic and causing symptoms, or locally advanced and therefore not suitable for surgery or treatment with radiation. 2-Chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide was specifically described in WO2006028958 dealing also with pharmaceutical composition, synthesis and a crystallization method of Vismodegib. Preparation methods of the 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)- benzamide free base are disclosed in WO2009126863. Many pharmaceutical solid compounds can exist in various crystalline forms regarded as polymorphs and hydrates/solvates. Organic bases, like vismodegib may exist in various crystal modifications having different crystal units and hence different physico-chemical properties including melting point, solubility, dissolution rate and finally, bioavailability. In order to distinguish the distinct solid phases of a compound several solid state analytical techniques can be used, e.g. X-Ray Powder Diffraction, solid state NMR and Raman spectroscopy, thermoanalytical methods. Discovery of new solid phases (polymorphs, solvates and hydrates) of an active pharmaceutical compound offers the opportunity to select the appropriate form having desirable physicochemical properties and processability and improve the characteristics of the pharmaceutical product. For this reason there is an explicit need for new solid forms (polymorphs, solvates, hydrates) of vismodegib. Different salts of an active pharmaceutical ingredient may possess different properties and such variations in the properties of various salts may provide a basis for improving formulation, for example, by facilitating better processing characteristics, improving the dissolution profile or improving stability. The objective of the present invention is to provide novel pharmaceutically acceptable solid crystalline forms od free base and salt of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4- (methylsulfonyl)benzamide with good chemical purity and stability as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. It is very important from economical point of view that the preparation process is suitable for industrial scale application and easily reproducible. Summary of the invention The invention provides new pharmaceutically acceptable solid forms of vismodegib free base and processes of their preparation. These forms can be used to prepare vismodegib salts or vismodegib free base and to prepare formulation thereof. The invention provides new pharmaceutically acceptable salts of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3- (pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide in crystalline or amorphous form and methods of their production. These salts can be used to prepare vismodegib salts or vismodegib free base forms and to prepare formulation thereof. The solid forms of vismodegib are as follows: A) the crystalline form 1 of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methyl- sulfonyl)benzamide; B) the crystalline form 2 of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methyl- sulfonyl)benzamide; C) the crystalline form 3 of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methyl- sulfonyl)benzamide; D) the crystalline form 4 of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methyl- sulfonyl)benzamide; E) the crystalline form 5 of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methyl- sulfonyl)benzamide; The salts of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide of the present invention are as follows: F) the salt of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide and hydrobromic acid. G) the salt of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide and benzenesulphonic acid; H) the salt of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide and 4-chlorobenzenesulphonic acid; I) the salt of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide and p-toluenesulphonic acid; Many organic compounds exist in different solid forms that can be in amorphous or in crystalline state. The ability of a compound to crystallize in different crystalline phases is called polymorphism. The term polymorph may include the amorphous phase (disordered), hydrates (water presents in the crystal lattice) and solvates (solvents other than water present in the crystal lattice). Different crystalline modifications have different crystal structures and different free energies, therefore polymorphs represent different physico-chemical properties such as melting point, density, solubility, chemical stability and finally, bioavailability. The difference in the crystal lattice of the crystalline modifications of a compound is expressed in different crystal symmetry and unit cell parameters which appears as the X-Ray diffraction characteristics of a crystalline powder. The different crystalline modifications generate different set of angles and different values of the intensity and finally resulted in different X-Ray powder diffractogram. Amorphous phases lack the long-range order characteristic of a crystal. The absence of crystallinity is easily observed in an X-Ray powder diffractogram. Therefore, the X-Ray Powder Diffractogram can be used to identify different crystalline modifications as well as the amorphous phase. The term„crystalline" refers to vismodegib free base and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as used in this patent application, is synonymous to commonly used expressions polymorphic form", „crystalline form" or„crystalline modification" of vismodegib free base or vismodegib salts. The term „amorphous" refers to vismodegib salts, as used in this patent application, is synonymous to commonly used expressions„amorphous vismodegib salts". The term „room temperature" is defined as a temperature between 15°C and 30°C; preferably it is between 20-25°C or about 25°C. The term Jaboratory condition", as used in this patent application, means room temperature and relative humidity 20-60%. An advantage of the newly prepared forms of vismodegib and vismodegib salts consists in their good physical and chemical characteristics, which make them suitable for preparation of a dosage form. In addition these salts are easily producible by a 1-step method in polar aprotic solvents, preferably in acetonitrile with an excellent chemical purity. The present invention further relates to characterization of prepared forms and salts of vismodegib using Raman, 1H-NMR, solid state NMR, XRPD and DSC techniques and to pharmaceutical formulations containing the novel salts of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2- yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide. Use of the novel salts of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3- (pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzamide in the preparation of vismodegib in its free form or in the form of any other pharmaceutical acceptable salt thereof is also part of the invention.

The inventive salts of 2-chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4- (methylsulfonyl)benzamide can be obtained with high purity in amorphous or crystalline form.
