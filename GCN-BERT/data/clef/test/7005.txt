Step 4: Synthesis of 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzoyl chloride (6)
To a two neck flask (1L) placed in ice bath was placed 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzoic acid (5) (50 g, 0.248 mol, 1 equiv.). Thionyl chloride (110 ml, 1.51 mol, 6.1 equiv.) was added dropwise at 0° C. The reaction mixture was allowed to come to RT and then heated to reflux. The heating was continued overnight. The thionyl chloride was evaporated and ice (approx. 150 g) was added to the reaction mixture. The aqueous reaction mixture was extracted with DCM (2×200 mL). The DCM extracts were combined dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to get 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzoyl chloride (6) (50 g (91.7% yield)) as a light yellow liquid.
