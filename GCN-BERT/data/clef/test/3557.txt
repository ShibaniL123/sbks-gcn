Step 5
(2-Oxo-1-oxa-3-azaspiro[4.5]decane-8-yl) methyl methanesulfonate
8-(Hydroxymethyl)-1-oxa-3-azaspiro[4.5]decane-2-one (200 mg, 1.08 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (20 mL), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.81 mL, 1.62 mmol) was added, methanesulfonyl chloride (148 mg, 1.30 mmol) was added dropwise at 0°C and the reaction was stirred at 0°C for 0.5 h. The reaction solution was quenched by adding water (10 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (3:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.5) to give (2-oxo-1-oxa-3-azaspiro[4.5]decane-8-yl) methyl methanesulfonate (285 mg, as a white solid) with a yield of 100%. MS-ESI calcd.[M + H]+ 264, found 264.
