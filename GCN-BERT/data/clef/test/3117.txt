BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention Embodiments of the invention relate to a surgical instrument which is used to operate a book nose, and more particularly to a surgical instrument for removing a hook nose hump through an osteotomy of the nasal hump of the hook nose having the prominent nasal hump. 2. Description of the Related Art A nose having a prominent nasal hump from the ridge of the nose is called a hook nose. The hook nose is not beautiful aesthetically and causes a bad impression. Therefore, it is very important to remove the hook nose hump in rhinoplasty. The hook nose hump is removed by being cut or ground. Cutting the bone is called an osteotomy and a surgical instrument which is used in osteotomy is called an osteotome. An existing surgical instrument for cutting the hook nose hump includes an osteotome, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,716,057. The osteotome includes a stabilizer in which an arch-shaped concave portion is formed on the handle and includes an integral blade which has an edge and protrusion formed on one side of the handle. This intends to remove the hook nose hump through an osteotomy of the hook nose hump by means of the blade by holding the stabilizer of the osteotome in operation. In the osteotomy, it is difficult to properly maintain the angle and height of the osteotome. As a result, there is a risk of removing too much or too little hook nose hump. SUMMARY Embodiments of invention maintain the operation angle and height of the surgical instrument in an osteotomy and removal of the prominent nasal hump of a hook nose. Embodiments of the invention tallow a user to easily hold the nasal hump surgical instrument and to make it easier to perform the osteotomy of the nasal hump by means of a blade sliding from a guide member. According to an embodiment, there is provided a surgical instrument for removing a hook nose hump. According to at least one embodiment, guide members for forward and backward sliding a handle are coupled to the both sides of the handle including a blade having a prominent edge at the front end thereof. A mounting concave portion for mounting the nasal hump, which is a surgical subject, is formed at the front portion of the guide members. According to an embodiment, the blade of the handle is integrated between an upper plate and a lower plate having the shape of a flat sheet and having a predetermined length. The width of the blade is smaller than the width of the upper and lower plates. Sliding grooves are respectively formed between the both sides of the blade and the upper and lower plates. The guide members include rod-shaped rails respectively inserted into the sliding grooves so as to slide the handle, and mounting rods of which one side is coupled to the front portions of the rails and of which the other side has mounting concave portions capable of being hooked onto the nasal hump. According to an embodiment, a stopper, which limits the sliding of the lower plate, is formed at one of the rails to which one of the mounting rods is coupled. According to an embodiment, the surgical instrument includes a stopper formed at each rail. According to an embodiment, the surgical instrument further includes an interval maintaining portion which is coupled to a side end or lower portion of the rails and makes it possible for the rails to maintain a constant interval. According to an embodiment, the surgical instrument further includes a stabilizer which protrudes from and is coupled to the top of the upper plate of the handle and moves forward and backward the handle. According to an embodiment, a concave portion is formed on right and left sides of the stabilizer. According to an embodiment, a riser portion is formed on both sides of the edge. According to at least one embodiment, the surgical instrument facilitates the osteotomy of the nasal hump since the handle coupled to the guide members can be forward and backward slid, provides convenience of surgical operation through the selection of the osteotomy angle of the nasal hump and the maintenance of proper angle and height of the surgical instrument since the mounting concave portions formed at the mounting rods of the guide members can be hooked onto the nasal hump, reduces the surgical time for the osteotomy of the nasal hump, and enables more precise and stable surgical operation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Hereafter, a surgical instrument for removing a hook nose hump according to various embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Advantages and features of the invention and methods of accomplishing the same will be apparent by referring to embodiments described below in detail in connection with the accompanying drawings. However, the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed below and may be implemented in various different forms. The embodiments are provided only for completing the disclosure of the invention and for fully representing the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. For simplicity and clarity of illustration, the drawing figures illustrate the general manner of construction, and descriptions and details of well-known features and techniques may be omitted to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the discussion of the described embodiments of the invention. Additionally, elements in the drawing figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. According to at least one embodiment, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help improve understanding of embodiments of the invention. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout the specification. Referring to FIG. 1, a surgical instrument 10 for removing a hook nose hump, according to at least one embodiment, includes a handle 12 and guide members 23, which support the handle in a sliding manner and maintains an osteotomy angle. According to at least one embodiment, the guide members 23 for forward and backward sliding the handle 12 are coupled to the both sides of the handle 12, which includes a blade 14 having a prominent edge 15 at the front end thereof. Also, a mounting concave portion 30 for mounting a nasal hump, which is a surgical subject, is formed at the front portion of the guide members 23. According to at least one embodiment, the surgical instrument 10 further includes an upper plate 17 and a lower plate 18 having the shape of a flat sheet and having a predetermined length. The upper plate 17 and the lower plate 18 are integrally coupled to the top and bottom of the blade 14 of the handle 12. The blade 14 is more prominent than the upper plate 17 and the lower plate 18. According to at least one embodiment, the blade 14 has a structure allowing the upper plate 17 and the lower plate 18 to be replaced with each other, but is not limited thereto. According to at least one embodiment the width of the blade 14 is smaller than the width of the upper plate 17 and the width of the lower plate 18. As further shown in FIG. 1, sliding grooves 19 are respectively formed between the both sides of the blade 14 and the upper and lower plates 17 and 18. Also, a riser portion 16 is formed on both sides of the edge 15. According to at least one embodiment, the width the riser portion 16 of the edge 15 becomes larger than the width of the blade 14 toward the front end portion of the blade 14 from the body of the blade 14. Therefore, the width of the portion of the edge 15, which performs the osteotomy, is increased. According to at least one embodiment, a knob-shaped stabilizer 20 protrudes from and is coupled to the top of the upper plate 17 of the handle 12. The handle 12 is moved forward and backward by pushing or pulling the stabilizer 20 with a finger, etc. Also, a concave portion 21 is formed on right and left sides, for example, of the stabilizer 20 and has a shape allowing the stabilizer 20 to be easily held by the finger. Also, protrusions or unevenness, etc., is formed on the surface of the stabilizer 20, thereby preventing the finger from being slid. According to at least one embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 2a and 2b, the guide members 23 support the handle 12 and slide the handle 12 forward and backward. The guide-members 23 include rod-shaped rails 25, which are inserted respectively into the sliding groove 19. A mounting rod 28 is coupled to the front portion of each of the rails 25. The mounting concave portion 30 is configured to hook onto the nasal hump, which is a surgical subject, and is formed at the end portion of the mounting rod 28. It is recommended that the shape of the mounting concave portion 30 should be an approximate circular arc shape or a triangular shape to be hooked or mounted onto the nasal hump. According to at least one embodiment, as further shown in FIGS. 2a and 2b, a stopper 26, which limits the sliding of the lower plate 18, is formed at the front portion of each rail 25, i.e., the portion to which the mounting rod 28 is coupled. The stopper 26 is formed by bending the rail 25 at an approximate right angle and limits the forward movement of the lower plate 18. It is desirable to limit in such a manner that the edge 15 of the blade 14 moves only up to the vicinity of the top or rear of the mounting concave portion 30. According to at least one embodiment, as further shown in FIGS. 2a and 2b, an interval maintaining portion 32 is coupled to either the side ends of the rails 25 or the lower portion of the rails 25. The interval maintaining portion 32 maintains a constant interval between the rails 25, thereby firmly supporting the forward and backward sliding of the handle 12. The interval maintaining portion 32 includes a function of allowing an operator to mount his/her finger. For example, when the operator places his/her thumb at the front portion of the interval maintaining portion 32, the interval maintaining portion 32 performs a function as a fulcrum, enabling the operator to push the stabilizer 20 of the handle 12 with his/her thumb. FIGS. 2 a and 2b show that the handle 12 and the guide members 23 have been integrally combined with each other. FIG. 2a shows that the handle 12 has moved forward from the guide members 23. As a result, the edge 15 of the blade 14 comes in contact with the nasal hump, i.e., the surgical object. FIG. 2b shows that the handle 12 has moved backward along the rails 25 of the guide members 23. FIG. 3 shows a state where the nasal hump of the hook nose is operated by using the surgical instrument 10 for removing the hook nose hump according to at least one embodiment of the invention. Under the state where the mounting concave portion 30 of the mounting rod 28 is mounted on the nasal hump “B” of a skull “S”, the osteotomy of the nasal hump “B” is performed with the blade 14 by hitting the handle 12 with a hammer. When the osteotomy of the nasal hump “B” is performed, the mounting concave portion 30 is positioned on the nose root portion, which is the lowest portion of the nasal hump. The mounting concave portion 30 allows the surgical instrument 10 to have a proper angle and height so as not to be inclined excessively downward or upward or allows the surgical instrument 10 to maintain a certain angle. The surgical instrument 10 according to an embodiment of the invention makes it easier to maintain the osteotomy angle of the nasal hump “B” of the hook nose by the rails 25, which slides the handle 12 forward and backward and by the guide members 23, which include the mounting concave portion 30 of the mounting rod 28, thereby reducing the surgical time and enabling more precise surgical operation. Embodiments of the invention eliminate the danger by preventing the surgical instrument 10 from being inclined excessively downward and prevents the insufficient osteotomy by causing the surgical instrument 10 not to be inclined excessively upward.
