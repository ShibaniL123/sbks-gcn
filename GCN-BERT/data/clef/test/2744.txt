CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a national phase entry of International Application No. PCT/IB2010/051897 filed on Apr. 30, 2010, which in turn claims priority to Italian Patent priority No. MI2009A000747 filed on Apr. 30, 2009; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The skin provides an effective barrier against the harmful effects of the environment, protecting the body's internal organs. The main layers of the skin include the epidermis, the dermis and the hypodermis. The human epidermis is quite thick and comprises up to 15 layers. It represents the body's first defensive barrier against physical, chemical and environmental harmful agents, including ultraviolet radiation, for instance, thermal and osmotic shocks, and the airborne pollutants that are increasingly widespread in the environment nowadays. Suppression of the skin's immune system is known to be one of the mechanisms by means of which such harmful agents can induce, for instance, the onset of skin tumours, mainly affecting the epidermal layer and the corresponding cells. To give an example, ultraviolet radiation induces both immediate and late changes in the skin during and after the period of exposure. In addition to visible changes, such as the formation of sunstroke-induced cells (known as “sunburn cells”), the production of melanin by the melanocytes and a thickening of the corneal layer due to the action of specific cytokeratins, several changes occurring at molecular level are responsible for potential long-term damage, such as: endogenous antioxidant depletion, which occurs in the hours immediately after exposure to radiation and induces a cascade of late degenerative reactions (known as oxidative stress) affecting the skin's whole structure, epidermis and dermis; the immune reaction in which the protagonists are the Langerhans cells, the reaction being mediated by cytokines and other soluble factors; molecular damage to the DNA, particularly through the formation of 8-oxy D guanosine.

The object of the present invention is to provide a means for effectively combating the immunosuppressive action on the skin of aggressive agents, e.g. airborne pollutants, dehydrating agents, ultraviolet radiation, thermal and osmotic shocks, and others. EP1328268, owned by the same applicant, describes the antioxidant activity of a combination of the flavonoids catechin and quercetin, based particularly on a clinical study that demonstrated a marked platelet aggregation inhibitory activity. Said patent also suggested an antioxidant activity that contrasted the skin ageing effect of ultraviolet radiation. Generally speaking, however, it is impossible to say whether the antioxidant activity of a given compound, or combination of compounds, can coincide with an action against immunosuppressive effects and consequently with an immunoprotective activity of the type discussed above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, it has surprisingly been discovered from the outcome of an experimental study that catechin and quercetin, combined together in a selected quantitative ratio, constitute an effective active ingredient for combating the immunosuppressive action on the skin of the above-mentioned aggressive agents. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Below are the structural formulas and molecular weights of catechin and quercetin: The object of the present invention is thus the use of said combination as an active ingredient in the preparation of a pharmaceutical, dermatological, nutritional or cosmetic composition for combating the immunosuppressive action on the skin of aggressive agents such as airborne pollutants, dehydrating agents, ultraviolet radiation, thermal and osmotic shocks, and the corresponding composition, characterised in that it comprises as active ingredient a combination of catechin and quercetin in a molar ratio approximately in the range of 6:1 and 3:1, respectively. The composition according to the invention can be formulated for topical use on the skin or for systemic use, e.g. in a form suitable for oral administration. Below are several descriptions of compositions according to the present invention, which shall not be intended as limiting. In examples 1-5, the quantities of the components are expressed as weight to weight percentages within a given range, as stated below. For quercetin, on the other hand, a molar ratio of quercetin to catechin of 1:5 is indicated, in relation to the quantity of catechin chosen within said stated range.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES The experimental study is described below with reference to the graphs in the attached figures. FIG. 1 shows a graph referring to the expression of the cytokine IL-10. FIG. 2 shows a graph referring to the expression of the cytokine IL-12. FIG. 3 shows a graph referring to the expression of TNF-α according to the detailed description given below. FIG. 4 shows the immunohistochemistry of the thymine dimers in the irradiated sample (1 MED), with and without treatment with the catechin and quercetin combination 4 hours after irradiation. IN VITRO STUDY Introduction and Aim This study was conducted on human epidermis reconstructed in vitro to assess the immunoprotective and preventive action of the combination of catechin and quercetin against DNA damage induced by UVA and UVB radiation at a minimum erythematous dose (1 MED). UV-induced DNA damage is known to be one of the main molecular mediators of photo-immunosuppression (Schwarz et al., 2005). A study conducted by the Kripke group (1992) clearly demonstrated that the DNA is the preferential target of UV radiation in the process of eliciting systemic immunosuppression, and that the primary molecular event mediating this type of UV-induced immunosuppression is the formation of pyrimidine dimers. In particular, the methods specifically active against this type of DNA lesion are effective tools for restoring immunological function. In parallel with the study on UV-induced DNA damage, the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-12, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were also analysed. The experimental approach adopted for the study as a whole enabled us to identify already in an early stage (and consequently very important for its dermatological action in preventing photo-induced damage) the degree of activity of the molecules considered in combating the immunosuppression processes induced by UV radiation in a physiological condition of vital epidermis submitted to UV-induced stress; this was done using relevant, dynamic and highly sensitive parameters, such as the expression of mediators and damage to the DNA at molecular level. It is well known that certain cytokines, and the interleukin IL-12 in particular, have an immunomodulating activity in relation to the immunocompetent cells, i.e. the Langerhans cells. We consequently decided to use this early mechanism of epidermal keratinocyte-mediated immune response following UV radiation to evaluate the activity of the compounds considered here. IL-10 is a crucial factor for preserving the fine balance between resistance to pathogens and harmful systemic inflammation, and it is a powerful inhibitor of IL-12 production (Haste-Amezaga et al., 1998, D'Andrea et al., 1993). IL-12 expression in the epidermal keratin cells after UV radiation was assessed using the RT-PCR method. The protective effect against DNA damage was judged from the formation of dimers with a pyrimidine base (thymine) at basal and supra-basal epidermal level, which becomes apparent already 4 hours after exposure: these dimers are recognized markers of NMSC (non-melanoma skin cancer) and their formation is assessed by immunohistochemistry. The immunohistochemical examination of the tissues treated with catechin and quercetin showed a more limited immunostaining, indicative of a reduction of the thymine dimers. FIG. 4 shows images of the immunohistochemical slides of the thymine dimers, with the untreated irradiated sample (1 MED) on the left and the sample treated with the catechin and quercetin mixture according to the invention on the right, 4 hours after irradiation, showing the more limited cell staining in the latter. The same method was used to assess the formation of 8-oxy D-guanosine, a specific marker of UVA-induced DNA damage. For this experiment, we used 0.9% physiological solution as the inactive control substance and a mixture containing catechin and quercetin, in a weight/weight ratio of 5:1, dissolved in physiological solution as the composition according to the invention. FIGS. 1-3 in the attached drawings show graphs relating to the expressions of IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-alpha obtained for an unirradiated control, an untreated irradiated control and an irradiated sample treated with the composition according to the invention (catechin+quercetin). Each pair of adjacent columns in the graphs refers to the case of a 4-hour UV treatment (paler column on the left, 4 h) and a 24-hour treatment (darker column on the right, 24 h), respectively, irradiated as in 1MED. Results The outcome of a histological assessment using immunofluorescence demonstrated that: a) 8 oxy D-guanosine, a biomarker of UVA-induced oxidative stress: 4 hours after irradiation, the catechin and quercetin mixture demonstrated a protective effect, since the formation of 8 oxy was inhibited by comparison with the irradiated control;b) thymine dimers: there was evidence of the inhibition of pyrimidine dimer formation 4 hours after exposure in the mixture treated with catechin and quercetin. The increased IL-10 levels by comparison with the unirradiated control, after UV radiation with and without catechin+quercetin treatment, are evidence of the immunosuppression-oriented changes occurring in the cutaneous environment (FIG. 1). On the other hand, the predominance of IL-10 over IL-12 (FIG. 2) is essential to favouring the regression of the inflammatory response after UV radiation. In particular, a picture of higher IL-10 levels and lower IL-12 levels in the skin is consistent with the immunosuppressive effect of UV exposure and the skin's need to restrict the inflammatory response (Kang et al., 1997). IL-12 is also suppressed by TNF-alpha, another cytokine closely linked to IL-12 in regulating inflammatory response and IFN-gamma production (Ma and Trinchieri, 2001). TNF-alpha has a key role as a mediator of UV-induced skin damage (Barr et al., 1999). UV exposure prompts an increment in TNF-alpha levels, while treatment with catechin and quercetin leads to a reduction of TNF-alpha levels. This finding, as illustrated in FIG. 3, is closely related to the increase that catechin+quercetin treatment induces in IL-10 levels, since IL-10 is a powerful inhibitor of TNF-alpha (Bogdan et al., 1991). Conclusions The results of the above-described study globally demonstrated a surprisingly protective action of the catechin and quercetin mixture according to the invention, associated with an anti-inflammatory activity emerging from the evidence of the protective action against DNA damage induced by UVA and/or UVB, and of the IL-10 and TNF-alpha expression levels. The effective achievement of the objects of the invention was thus demonstrated. 1.
