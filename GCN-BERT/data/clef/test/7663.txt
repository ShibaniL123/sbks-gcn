FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to heterocyclic compounds having activity in modulation of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). The invention also relates to the use of heterocyclic compounds in treating diseases and conditions mediated by modulation of the α7 nAChR. In addition, the invention relates to compositions containing the heterocyclic compounds and processes for their preparation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), by binding to cholinergic receptors, causes the opening of ion channels within the mammalian system. The central nervous system (CNS) contains two types of ACh receptor, muscarinic receptors and nAChRs. nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels containing five subunits (for reviews, see Colquhon et al. (1997) Advances in Pharmacology 39, 191-220; Williams et al. (1994) Drug News & Perspectives 7, 205-223; Doherty et al. (1995) Annual reports in Medicinal Chemistry 30, 41-50). The nAChR gene family can be divided into two groups: those coding for β subunits and those coding for α subunits (for reviews, see Karlin & Akabas (1995) Neuron 15, 1231-1244; Sargent (1993) Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 16, 403-443). Three of the α subunits, α7, α8 and α9, can form functional receptors when expressed alone and form homooligomeric receptors. Studies have indicated that neuronal nicotinic receptors play important roles in modulating neurotransmission, cognition, sensory gating, and anxiety (Zarei et al. Neuroscience 1999, 88, 755-764, Frazier et al. J. Neurosci. 1998, 18, 8228-8235, Radcliffe et al. J. Neurosci. 1998, 18, 7075-7083, Minana et al. Neuropharmacology 1998, 37, 847-857, Albuquerque et al. Toxicol. Lett. 1998, 102-103, 211-218, Neubauer, et al. Neurology 1998, 51, 1608-1612, Stevens et al. Psychopharmacology 1998, 136, 320-327, Adler et al. Schizophrenia Bull. 1998, 24, 189-202.); thus, there has been interest in the use of compounds that modulate these receptors for treating CNS disorders. A role for α7 receptors in the etiology of schizophrenia has been suggested by linkage studies (Freedman et al, Psychopharmacology (2004), 174(1), 54-64) demonstrating an association between the α7 locus and a sensory gating deficit which represents a major schizophrenia endophenotype. Such gating deficits in patients have been transiently reversed by nicotine with a pharmacology consistent with action via α7. In addition, in animal models, lesion of forebrain cholinergic afferents or pharmacological blockade of α7 receptors elicits similar sensory gating deficits which are also apparent in in-bred mouse strains expressing reduced levels of the α7 receptor. Nicotine has been reported to normalise the deficits in both lesioned animals and in-bred mouse strains, again with a pharmacology compatible with activity at the α7 receptor. Pharmacological blockade of α7 receptors has been reported to impair rodent short-term working memory, whilst receptor activation has been reported to enhance performance in the same paradigm, thus implicating α7 receptors as a target for cognitive enhancement. α7 nAChRs are characterised by their fast activation kinetics and high permeability to Ca2+ compared to other subtypes (Delbono et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997, 280, 428-438.) and exhibit rapid desensitization following exposure to agonists. (Castro et al., Neurosci. Lett. 1993, 164, 137-140, Couturier et al., Neuron 1990, 5, 847-856, Alkondon et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994, 271, 494-506). Treatment with α7 agonists may therefore be problematic because both acetylcholine and nicotine both show activation followed by blockade and/or desensitisation of the receptor and hence chronic treatment with an agonist may well result in apparent antagonism. In addition, agonists have been shown to exhibit highest affinity for the desensitised state of the receptor and can, thus, mediate receptor desensitisation at concentrations below the threshold for receptor activation (Briggs and McKenna. Neuropharmacology 1998 37, 1095-1102). This problem may be overcome by treatment with a positive allosteric modulator (PAM). PAMs enhance α7 nAChR activation mediated by endogenous or exogenous agonists without activating the receptor in their own right, i.e. in the absence of agonist. A number of PAMs have been reported (Lightfoot et al. Progress in medicinal chemistry 46:131-71, 2008). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to heterocylic compounds having activity in modulation of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR).

In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, further comprises an additional therapeutic agent. The compounds of the invention may be administered by any convenient method, for example by oral, parenteral (e.g. intravenous), buccal, sublingual, nasal, rectal or transdermal administration and the pharmaceutical compositions adapted accordingly. The compounds of the invention which are active when given orally can be formulated as liquids or solids, for example syrups, suspensions or emulsions, tablets, capsules and lozenges. A liquid formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound or salt in a suitable liquid carrier(s) for example an aqueous solvent such as water, ethanol or glycerine, or a non-aqueous solvent, such as polyethylene glycol or an oil. The formulation may also contain a suspending agent, preservative, flavouring or colouring agent. A composition in the form of a tablet can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier(s) routinely used for preparing solid formulations. Examples of such carriers include magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, sucrose and cellulose. A composition in the form of a capsule can be prepared using routine encapsulation procedures. For example, pellets containing the active ingredient can be prepared using standard carriers and then filled into a hard gelatin capsule; alternatively, a dispersion or suspension can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier(s), for example aqueous gums, celluloses, silicates or oils and the dispersion or suspension then filled into a soft gelatin capsule. Typical parenteral compositions consist of a solution or suspension of the compound or salt in a sterile aqueous carrier or parenterally acceptable oil, for example polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, lecithin, arachis oil or sesame oil. Alternatively, the solution can be lyophilised and then reconstituted with a suitable solvent just prior to administration. Compositions for nasal administration may conveniently be formulated as aerosols, drops, gels and powders. Aerosol formulations typically comprise a solution or fine suspension of the active substance in a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous or non-aqueous solvent and are usually presented in single or multidose quantities in sterile form in a sealed container, which can take the form of a cartridge or refill for use with an atomising device. Alternatively the sealed container may be a unitary dispensing device such as a single dose nasal inhaler or an aerosol dispenser fitted with a metering valve which is intended for disposal once the contents of the container have been exhausted. Where the dosage form comprises an aerosol dispenser, it will contain a propellant which can be a compressed gas such as compressed air or an organic propellant such as a fluorochlorohydrocarbon. The aerosol dosage forms can also take the form of a pump-atomiser. Compositions suitable for buccal or sublingual administration include tablets, lozenges and pastilles, wherein the active ingredient is formulated with a carrier such as sugar and acacia, tragacanth, or gelatin and glycerin. Compositions for rectal administration are conveniently in the form of suppositories containing a conventional suppository base such as cocoa butter. Compositions suitable for transdermal administration include ointments, gels and patches. The composition may be in unit dose form such as a tablet, capsule or ampoule. Each dosage unit for oral administration may contain, for example, from 1 to 500 mg (and for parenteral administration contains, for example, from 0.1 to 50 mg) of a compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof calculated as the free base. In an embodiment the unit dose for oral administration contains from 50 to 450 mg. In a further embodiment the unit dose contains from 100 to 400 mg. In order to obtain consistency of adjunctive administration, the compositions of each of the components, or of the combination of the components is, for example, in the form of a unit dose.
