Step 2. 3,5-Difluoro-4-(3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridin-5-yl)aniline
5-Chloro-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (348 mg, 0.956 mmol, Intermediate 2), 3,5-difluoro-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)aniline (293 mg, 1.148 mmol), chloro(2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)[2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) (Pd XPhos G2) (75 mg, 0.096 mmol) and potassium phosphate (406 mg, 1.91 mmol) were placed in a flask and the flask was evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Then dioxane (20 mL) and degassed water (2 mL) were added and the reaction was stirred at 90° C. for 2 h. After cooling to r.t., the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The separate organic layer was washed with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure and obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (354 mg, 81%).
