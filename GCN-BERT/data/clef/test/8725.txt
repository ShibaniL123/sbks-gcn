TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a process for producing (Z)-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e] oxepin-2-acetic acid or an acid addition salt thereof, which is useful as a medicinal agent. BACKGROUND ART (Z)-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid is a compound represented by Formula [II]: and is a useful pharmaceutical compound to be applied to allergic diseases such as hay fever, allergic rhinitis and urticaria (USP 5,116,863). In the production of (Z)-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid, generally, an E isomer is produced at the same time, and, therefore, isomerization is necessary to efficiently obtain the Z isomer of interest. WO 2007/105234 discloses heating 11-hydroxy-11-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid in the presence of hydrochloric acid at 90°C; thereafter, extracting, with methylene chloride, a solution containing a mixture of E and Z isomers of 11-hydroxy-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid; and adding a poor solvent such as acetone to deposit a precipitate, thereby obtaining the Z isomer, the E isomer being isolated by column chromatography for recovery thereof. The yields of the Z and E isomers are 25. 4% and 67%, respectively, and the yield of the Z isomer, olopatadine, is very low. Thus, this process is not suitable for an industrial production process. WO 2008/099900 discloses that (2)-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid can be efficiently produced by heating an ester of 11-hydroxy-11-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenz [b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid in the presence of an acid in a solvent. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing (Z)-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid or an acid addition salt thereof, which is useful as a medicinal agent, in an efficient and industrially advantageous manner. According to the present invention, 11-hydroxy-11-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid or a salt thereof is subjected to a heat treatment and a water removal treatment in a reaction system in the presence of a specific acid in a solvent, so that the isomerization thereof to a Z isomer proceeds, thereby enabling the production of (Z)-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenz [b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid or an acid addition salt thereof in an efficient and industrially easy manner. That is, the present invention is as follows.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The salt of 11-hydroxy-11-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid represented by Formula [I] (Compound [I]) includes acid addition salts such as a hydrochloride, a hydrobromide, a sulfate, a methanesulfonate and a p-toluenesulfonate. The salt of (Z)-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid represented by Formula [II] (Compound [II]) includes acid addition salts such as a hydrochloride, a hydrobromide, a sulfate, a methanesulfonate and a p-toluenesulfonate. Compound [II] can be produced by subjecting Compound [I] to a heat treatment and a water removal treatment in the presence of an acid selected from the group consisting of hydrogen chloride, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid in a solvent. Hydrogen chloride is a preferable acid. Hydrogen chloride may be in the form of a solution of an organic solvent, but is preferably used in the form of a gas, and, in that case, is usually blown into a reaction system for use. The amount of the acid to be used is preferably a proportion of usually from 2 to 5 mol, and preferably from 2.5 to 3.5 mol with respect to 1 mol of Compound [I] from the viewpoint of reaction rate and suppression of production of an E isomer and impurities. An organic solvent is preferably used. The organic solvent includes, for example, ketone solvents (such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone and cyclopentanone) and aromatic solvents (such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and nitrobenzene), and is preferably toluene or chlorobenzene, and particularly preferably toluene. The amount of the solvent to be used is preferably a proportion of usually from 10 L to 20 L, and preferably from 13 L to 16 L with respect to 1 kg of Compound [I] from the viewpoint of prevention of scaling and economic efficiency. Specific examples of a reaction method include: 1) a method including mixing a solvent, Compound [I] and an acid, and then subjecting the mixture to a heat treatment and a water removal treatment; 2) a method including adding Compound [I] to a solution containing a mixture of a solvent and an acid while subjecting Compound [I] to a heat treatment, followed by a water removal treatment; and 3) a method including mixing and heating a solvent and an acid, adding dropwise Compound [I] dissolved in the solvent, and then performing a water removal treatment. Also, the heat treatment and the water removal treatment in the reaction system may be performed at the same time. The chemical reaction of the present invention proceeds in accordance with the following scheme. In the scheme, A represents an acid. First, Compound [I] is converted, by an acid, into the corresponding acid addition salt. Dehydration (propylidenation at 11 position) proceeds due to heating, whereby water is generated. This generated water is removed from the reaction system so that dehydration is promoted and isomerization of Compound [I] to a Z isomer proceeds. The heat treatment is performed usually at 50°C to 150°C, preferably at 70°C to 120°C, and more preferably at 90°C to 110°C from the viewpoint of reaction rate and suppression of production of impurities. Examples of the method for water removal treatment in the reaction system include a method adding, for example, a C3-C8 carboxylic acid anhydride, a C2-C8 carboxylic halide or an oxyhalide of sulfur or phosphorus; a method by azeotropic distillation; and the like. C3-C8 carboxylic acid anhydride means a carboxylic acid anhydride wherein the number of carbon atoms in the entire acid anhydride ranges from C3 to C8, and includes, for example, acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, butyric anhydride, formic-acetic mixed acid anhydride, acetic-propionic mixed acid anhydride, succinic anhydride and maleic anhydride, and is preferably acetic anhydride. The amount of C3-C8 carboxylic acid anhydride to be used is a proportion of usually from 1 mol to 2 mol, and preferably from 1 to 1.5 mol with respect to 1 mol of Compound [I] from the viewpoint of prevention of scaling and economic efficiency. C2-C8 carboxylic halide includes, for example, C2-C8 carboxylic chlorides such as acetyl chloride, propionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride and benzoyl chloride; C2-C8 carboxylic bromides such as acetyl bromide, propionyl bromide, oxalyl bromide and benzoyl bromide, and is preferably a C2-C8 carboxylic chloride, particularly acetyl chloride. The amount of C2-C8 carboxylic halide to be used is a proportion of usually from 1 mol to 2 mol, and preferably from 1 to 1.5 mol with respect to 1 mol of Compound [I] from the viewpoint of prevention of scaling and economic efficiency. Examples of the oxyhalide of sulfur or phosphorus include thionyl chloride and phosphorus oxychloride. The amount of the oxyhalide of sulfur or phosphorus to be used is a proportion of usually from 0.5 mol to 2 mol, and preferably from 1 to 1.5 mol with respect to 1 mol of Compound [I] from the viewpoint of prevention of scaling and economic efficiency. The azeotropic distillation can be performed, for example, by a method using a Dean-Stark apparatus. Additionally, the azeotropic distillation is preferably performed under reduced pressure. When the azeotropic distillation is employed, it is necessary to select an organic solvent which can cause azeotropy with water. The order of azeotropic distillation includes, for example, 1) a method of performing azeotropic distillation simultaneously with a heat treatment and 2) a method of performing azeotropic distillation after a heat treatment. However, it is preferred, in the present invention, that azeotropic distillation be performed after a heat treatment, followed by an additional heat treatment. A preferred water removal treatment method is a method for water removal treatment by adding a C3-C8 carboxylic acid anhydride, by adding a C2-C8 carboxylic halide, or by azeotropic distillation. The reaction time usually ranges from 1 hour to 12 hours, and preferably 1 hour to 6 hours, depending on the reaction temperature, amounts of raw materials to be used and the like. This reaction is preferably carried out under stirring. While the reaction time depends on the reaction temperature, amounts of raw materials to be used and the like, the reaction is preferably carried out under stirring. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a seed crystal of Compound [II]. Due to this, the reaction easily proceeds, thereby enabling the suppression of scaling to a reaction container and the reduction in dropping time. The amount of the seed crystal to be used is a proportion of preferably from 0.1 to 2 parts by weight, and more preferably from 0.5 to 1.5 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of Compound [I]. In the meantime, the seed crystal is preferably added into the system during feeding of raw materials from the viewpoint of operability. The raw material, Compound [I], to be used in the production process according to the present invention can be produced by reacting 11-oxo-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid represented by Formula [III] (Compound [III]) and a Grignard reagent represented by Formula [IV] in accordance with the method described in WO 2008/099900. In the formula, X represents a chlorine atom or a bromine atom. Additionally, Compound [III] can be produced by the method described in J. Med. Chem., 19, 941 (1976) or 20, 1499 (1977), or USP 4,282,365. In this way, dehydration of Compound [I] and isomerization thereof to a Z isomer proceed. While a small quantity of E isomer and Compound [II] as a Z isomer deposited as crystals are present in the reaction system wherein the reaction has almost proceeded, Compound [II] can be acquired as an acid addition salt of the acid used in the reaction, by cooling (preferably, gradually cooling) the reaction mixture to room temperature, thereafter, filtering the reaction mixture to separate crystals therefrom, and then washing the crystals with an appropriate solvent such as acetone. While Compound [II] is obtained as an acid addition salt through the above reaction, the acid addition salt can be led to free Compound [II] by an alkaline treatment which is a conventional method. The thus-obtained Compound [II] is a high-purity crystal having a Z isomer/E isomer ratio (area ratio by HPLC measurement) of usually 98/2 or higher, and a high-purity crystal having the ratio of 99/1 or higher can also be obtained. Examples Hereinafter, the present invention will be described by way of Examples, but is not limited thereto. The ratio between an E isomer and a Z isomer of the compound produced was obtained from values measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
