Example 21. Preparation of Comparative PAG, CPAG-4
A 100 ml flask was charged with 1, 1-difluoro-2-oxo-2-(1-adamantylamino)ethanesulfonyl fluoride (SM-2) (1.49 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-hydroxyacetophenone (Sigma-Aldrich) (0.65 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (24 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 5 min at −50° C. nBuLi (1.6 M, 3.0 ml, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added drop-wise to the mixture over 10 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours while warming from −50° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (24 ml) was added to the final reaction mixture and then Et2O (72 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and the lower layer was extracted with Et2O (48 ml). The organic solutions were combined and the solvents were removed in an evaporator (25° C.) and the residue was washed with hexane (4×20 mL). The hexane was removed by decantation and the crude product was purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt) to obtain the target PAG as a brown oil (0.42 g, 20.5% yield).
