[00129] Effects of Sildenafil on the vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) have not previously been well recognized. To date, there are no detailed investigations about hypoxia-induced expression of VEGF in the pulmonary vascular system (Nirapil J. et al, Pediatric Research 68: 298, 2010). [00130] Oxidative stress and diseases [00131] Oxidative stress is suspected to be important in neurodegenerative diseases including Motor Neuron Disease (aka. Lou Gehrigs/ MND or ALS), Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease and skin disorders. Indirect evidence via monitoring biomarkers such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species production (RNP) and antioxidant defense indicates that oxidative damage may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases, while cumulative oxidative stress with disrupted mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial damage are related to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. [00132] Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the manifestation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a biological system or anti-oxidant environment to detoxify the resulting damage. Hypoxia, causing oxidative stress, plays an important role in promoting vascular endothelium proliferation. [00133] Hypoxia is a common cause of persistent pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in a newborn and a condition associated with endothelial dysfunction and abnormal pulmonary vascular remodeling. The GTPase RhoA and Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase II (ROCK II) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of persistent PAH, but their contribution to endothelial remodeling and function is not well known. ROCK II mediated hypoxia-induced capillary angiogenesis, a previously unrecognized but potentially important adaptive response. Sustained inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK II pathway throughout the period of hypoxic exposure attenuated the PAH and prevented remodeling in blood vessels without enlarging the lumen diameter. In contrast, this inhibition of RhoA ROCK II has also been confirmed in a monocrotaline-treated model of PAH not in hypoxia. [00134] Hypoxia-induced PAH is a complication of chronic lung diseases, which increases morbidity and mortality. Hypoxic PAH has previously been attributed to structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature, including narrowing of the vascular lumen and loss of vessels, which cause a fixed increase in resistance. PAH can be characterized by reduced eNOS/sGC, increased ROCK II expression and decreased pulmonary vascular density. The downstream of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling in the cGMP-pathway for inhibiting PAH includes the expression of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and protein kinase G (PKG), which have been reported to be down regulated by hypoxia. In hypoxic PAH, nitric oxide (NO) releasing can be caused by the down-regulation of eNOS/sGC and up-regulation of ROCK II. Vascular contractility and resistance has been regulated by eNOS, sGC, phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE-5A) and RhoA/ROCK II expression in the cGMP -pathway. Moreover, co-localized eNOS/sGC/ PDE-5A expression in pulmonary artery has been involved in Sildenafil's inhibition activity of PAH. Although Sildenafil and ROCK inhibitors Y27632 and Fasudil have been beneficial to PAH through, the inactivation of RhoA/ROCK II, the role of VEGF involved is unclear. [00135] VEGF is required for the growth of pulmonary endothelial cells and needed to repair the damage from hypoxia. One study has found pulmonary VEGF expression to be markedly decreased in an experimental model of persistent PAH, mimicking the structural and functional abnormalities of pulmonary artery, and that study found that exogenous treatment with VEGF improved PAH by up-regulating the production of NO. The controversy between increasing and decreasing VEGF for the treatment of PAH in hypoxia has yet to be resolved. Indeed, VEGF exerts its biological effects primarily on endothelial cells in hypoxia. However, a number of VEGF-mediated effects have been reported for non-endothelial cell types. ROCK II and VEGF signaling has been described to co-determine their contribution to angiogenesis. Hypoxia regulation of VEGF has been described through the induction of PI3K/Rho/ROCK and c-Myc, which is a target of the PI3K/ROCK II-signaling pathway and which can regulate the VEGF promoter through the binding elements. [00136] The expression of RhoA ROCK II is surprisingly close to the signaling of VEGF. A previous report has exposed that RhoA or ROCK II inhibition diminishes the VEGF-induced polymerization of actin. VEGF can induce RhoA activation in endothelial cells, mediate regenerative angiogenesis and tube formation, and the pharmacological inhibition of ROCK II disrupts vasculogenesis caused by VEGF. Even 3-hydroxy-3- methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-Co A) reductase inhibitor statin can increase eNOS, reduce cell proliferation and interfere with angiogenesis by inhibiting the geranylgeranylation of RhoA. ROCK inhibitor Fasudil inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. This evidence implicates the close relationship between RhoA/ROCK II and VEGF. [00137] Therapeutic benefits of ROCK inhibitor are partly due to the restoration of PKG-mediated vasodilatation in hypoxia. In addition, cGMP has been involved in the regulation of upstream eNOS/sGC/cGMP PKG/ PDE5A and downstream ROCK II VEGF in hypoxia. It is thus suggested that cGMP-dependent inhibition of Rho ROCK II by SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex is a suitable strategy of treatment to ROCK inhibitor Fasudil, cGMP-enhancer Sildenafil ascorbate complex and an ET-1 receptor antagonist, which is effective by inactivating ROCK II for the treatment of hypoxic PAH. [00138] ROS is an endogenous initiator and promoter of DNA damage and mutations that contribute to disease. It is essential to determine the production of ROS during hypoxia to evaluate the protective effects of Substituted Amine Analogs (SAA) derivative compound and SAA complex compound against hypoxia-induced oxidative damage. In this study, we measured the expression of eNOS, ROCK II and VEGF signaling and determined the production of NO and ROS. To confirm whether SAA derivative compounds and SAA complex compounds could ameliorate vascular narrowing and ventricular hypertrophy, we verified our findings by observing changes in pulmonary artery wall thickness, and the endothelium immunostaining reactivity of the VEGF/eNOS and RV/LV+S ratio under microscopic examination.

In 21 -day treatment of hypoxic rats with SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex or Sildenafil ascorbate complex (5 mg kg/day, p.o.), the development of PAH was markedly attenuated to 16.9±1.1 and 19.8±0.7 mmHg (n=6), respectively, by the last day (Fig. 3). Mean artery blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate were not significantly changed by either SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex or Sildenafil ascorbate complex. The heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW) of rats treated with SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex or Sildenafil ascorbate complex was significantly different from non-treated rats at after 21 days (Table 4). [00150] Table 4 Effects of treatment on rat hemodynamics with hypoxic PAH (note)Data were the means±SEM; P<0.05, compared to hypoxia body (BW); heart rate (HR); mean pulmomeary artery pressure (MPAP); mean artery blood pressure (MABP); heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) [00151] Vascular muscularizations [00152] Vascular muscularization or remodeling was represented by increases in the pulmonary arterial wall thickness (WT %) of hypoxic rats, examined on day 0 and day 21, following right lung resection. Small pulmonary arterial morphology (<150 μπι) was highly improved in the 5 mg/kg/day SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex treated rats. As shown in Fig. 4, sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE staining), indicating muscularizations of distal pulmonary artery (Fig. 4), were significantly lower in hypoxic rats treated with SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex (Fig. 4C) and Sildenafil ascorbate complex (Fig. 4D) than vehicle only (Fig. 4B). [00153] Relative pulmonary artery wall thickness (WT %) in lung after long-term hypoxia [00154] Quantitative analysis of the relative wall thickness of pulmonary artery showed that hypoxia increased the pulmonary artery wall thickness in lungs to 165.8±5.4% (* P < 0.01) (Fig. 5, 6A). But this condition was reversed by treatment with SPAAX-1 [Hypoxia+SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex (5 mg/kg/day)] or Sildenafil [Hypoxia+Sildenafil ascorbate complex (5 mg/kg/day)] for 21 days. Both SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex (Fig. 4C) and Sildenafil ascorbate complex (Fig. 4D) inhibited the hypoxia-induced pulmonary artery wall thickness. [00155] Right ventricular hypertrophy after long-term hypoxia [00156] Fig. 5 shows that SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex and Sildenafil ascorbate complex reduced the thickness of Right ventricular, compared to under the hypoxia state. As shown in Fig. 6 A, hypoxia increased the relative right ventricle (RV)/[left ventricle (LV)+ intraventricular septum (S)] weight ratio, i.e. right heart index, to 184.6±0.7%, compared to the normoxia rats. SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex reduced the right heart index to 117.4±2.6% (PO.01) and the Sildenafil ascorbate complex decreased the right heart index to 145.3±0.4% ( O.01), compared to hypoxic rats (Fig. 6 B). [00157] Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of eNOS and VEGF in pulmonary artery wall after long-term hypoxia [00158] Morphometric immunostaining of lung sections of animal with long-term hypoxia following treatment demonstrated a marked decrease of eNOS located mainly in endothelium of pulmonary artery, and this decrease was correlated with media thickening (Fig. 7A); VEGF-immunostaining was also mainly located in the endothelium and more significantly in the smooth muscle, compared to arterial section without immunostaining reactivity as a control (Fig. 8 A). Treatments with SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex or Sildenafil ascorbate complex after long-term hypoxia restored the decay of eNOS and reduced the VEGF immunostaining reactivity (Fig. 7 B, 8B). [00159] Immunohistochemistry of eNOS and VEGF in pulmonary artery wall after short-term hypoxia [00160] Fig. 9 and 10 show that ascorbic/ascorbate buffer (40, 80 μΜ) reduced the IHC of eNOS (Fig. 9A-9D) and VEGF (Fig. 10A-10D) in isolated pulmonary artery, indicating an oxidative stress defence against short-term acute hypoxia. [00161] Pulmonary artery eNOS/sGCal/PKG/PDE5A expression after long-term hypoxia [00162] Western blotting analysis demonstrated that eNOS and sGCal in lung tissue of the hypoxia-treated were increased by SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex to 139.7±16.9% (PO.05) and 40.4±8.4% (P<0.05) (Group 3, Fig. 11 A), by Sildenafil ascorbate complex to 102.6±7.7% and 72.0±4.7% (Group 4 Fig.1 IB), compared to normoxia control. Moreover, SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex was more potent than Sildenafil ascorbate complex in increasing eNOS, and Sildenafil ascorbate complex was more potent than SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex in increasing sGC expression. While SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex clearly increased PKG to 85.0±12.9% (Fig. 11), Sildenafil ascorbate complex only brought about an insignificant PKG increases to 68.7±3.7%, compared to non-treated hypoxic rats (Fig. 11C). Pphosphodiesterase5A (PDE5A) expression was decreased to 43.8±12.6% (P<0/05) in hypoxia. However, neither agent was found to further reduce the expression of PDE5A. Surprisingly, both SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex and Sildenafil ascorbate complex restored PDE5A expression to 76.9±4.9% and 109.0±3.8% of the normal level, compared to the non-treated hypoxic animal group (P<0.05) (Fig. 11D). [00163] Pulmonary artery VEGF/ROCKII expression after long-term hypoxia [00164] Expression of ROCK II and VEGF increased to 144.7±12.6% ( O.05) and 168.9±24.6% (PO.05), respectively, in hypoxia for 21 days. Treatment with SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex or Sildenafil ascorbate complex during this period prevented hypoxia-induced increases of PvOCKII to 50.32±7.9% (PO.01) and to 97.4±10.9%, respectively (Fig. HE). VEGF expression was reduced by SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex and Sildenafil ascorbate complex (120.9±22.2% and 125.7±22.5%, respectively), compared to the non-treated hypoxic rat group (Fig. 11F). SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex was found to decrease ROCK II more potently than Sildenafil, but these two agents were equally able to inhibit VEGF expression. [00165] Pulmonary artery eNOS, ROCKII and VEGF expression after short-term hypoxia [00166] As shown in Fig. 12A, in isolated pulmonary artery ring in normoxia for 24 hrs, the expression of eNOS was increased to 117.9±9.1% (PO.05) by SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex (10 μπι) and increased to 114.1±12.3% (PO.05) by a ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (10 μιη), respectively. Expression of ROCK II decreased to 48.2±5.5% (PO.05) by SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex and to 67.5±14.8% by Y27632 (PO.01), in comparison with non-treated controls. [00167] As shown in Fig. 12B, the expression of ROCK II in isolated hypoxic pulmonary artery for 24 hrs mcreased to 180±10.2% (PO.01) and eNOS% decreased to 60±8.3% (PO.05). Treatment with SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex returned ROCK II to 140±9.0% (PO.05) and eNOS to 45±3.0%. Treatment with Y27632 returned ROCK II to 150±13.1% and eNOS to 50±4.7%, compared to the control level in normoxia. [00168] As shown in Fig. 12C, neither SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex nor Sildenafil ascorbate complex significantly affected SGC-a in hypoxia. But SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex and Sildenafil ascorbate complex both restored eNOS and inhibited VEGF in acute hypoxia (Fig. 12A, 12D). [00169] Pulmonary artery ROS after long-term hypoxia [00170] Fig. 13 shows that hypoxia increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) of lung tissues detected by 2'-7'-dichlorofluorescein (H2DCF-DA) assay using fluorescence analysis. SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex and Sildenafil ascorbate complex reduced hypoxia-induced increase of dichlorofluorescein. [00171] Pulmonary artery NOx after long-term hypoxia [00172] Griess reagent analysis shows that the base levels of NOx in lung tissue were significantly decreased to 9.8±3.7 %, compared to 100 % of the control group, after 21 days of hypoxia (Fig. 14). The decreased levels of NOx in the hypoxic lung tissues were significantly restored by SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex and Sildenafil ascorbate complex, to 86.3±17.3 and 84.5±14.2 %, respectively (##P<0.01 versus control). [00173] Materials and methods [00174] Animal in hypoxia [00175] In our in vivo hypoxic experiments, 10-week old male Wistar rats were equally divided into four groups: a normoxia group, a hypoxia group, a hypoxia+ SPAAX-1 or SPAAX-1 RX complex group, and a hypoxia+Sildenafil or Sildenafil RX complex group. All the rats were maintained on a 12-h light/12-hr dark cycle at 25±l°Cand were provided with food and water ad libitum. The normoxia group was housed in standard normoxic conditions and the other three treated groups were continuously housed in a hypoxic chamber (10% 02) for 21 days, except for a 30-min interval each day when the chamber was cleaned (Fig. 2). During which, a normoxic gas mixture was prepared from compressed air. [00176] In our in vitro short-term experiment, isolated rat pulmonary artery was grown under normoxia (20 % 02) or hypoxia (1 % 02) at 37 °C for 24 hrs as was previously done (Wu BN, et al. Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol 24:925, 2011). The heart weight and body weight ratio (HW/BW) of the rats treated with one of SPAAX-1, SPAAX-1 RX complex, Sildenafil or Sildenafil RX complex each measured on the 21st hypoxic day. All animal care and the experimental protocols of this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Kaohsiung Medical University. Male Wistar rats (200-250 g), provided by the National Laboratory Animal Breeding and Research Center (Taipei, Taiwan), were housed under constant temperature and controlled illumination. Food and water were available ad libitum. [00177] Normoxic rats were housed in room temperature air at normal atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg). The hypoxic rats were housed in a hypobaric chamber for 21 days at 10% 02. After completion of the exposure, tissues were prepared as indicated for contraction measurements, Western blot analysis, RNA extraction, or morphological analysis. [00178] Hemodynamic measurements [00179] On the 21st day, the rats were administered urethane (1.25 g/kg, i.p.) and their chests were opened. Their breathing was normal and their body temperature was maintained at 37° C. Using a pressure transducer (Gould, Model P50, U.S.A.) connected to a Pressure Processor Amplifier (Gould, Model 13-4615-52, U.S.A.), we recorded mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) and the heart rates of the rats from the femoral artery and mean artery blood pressure (MABP) from the pulmonary artery. A femoral vein was then cannulated and heparinized for intravenous administration of normal saline, SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex, or Sildenafil ascorbate complex. The animals were then sacrificed by the administration of an overdose of urethane. [00180] Western blotting analysis [00181] Whole right lung tissues of hypoxia-treated and untreated rats were isolated and cut into small strips and placed into an extraction buffer (Tris 10 mM, pH 7.0, NaCl 140 mM, PMSF 2 mM, DTT 5 mM, NP-40 0.5%, pepstatin A 0.05 mM and leupeptin 0.2 mM) for protein extraction, and then centrifuged at 12,500 g for 30 min. To measure the expression levels of the proteins, the total proteins were extracted and Western blotting analysis was performed as described previously (Bivalacqua TJ, et al., 2013, TJ PLoSONE 8: e68028. doi:10.1371/journal. pone.0068028). Briefly, the protein extract was boiled to a ratio of 4: 1 with a sample buffer (Tris 100 mM, pH 6.8, glycerol 20%, SDS 4% and bromophenol blue 0.2%). Electrophoresis was performed using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (2 hr, 100 V, 40 mA, 50 mg protein per lane). Separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes treated with 5% fat-free milk powder to block the nonspecific IgGs (90 min, 100 V) and incubated for one hour with a specific protein antibody. The blot was then incubated with anti-mouse or anti-goat IgG linked to alkaline phosphatase (1 : 1000) for 1 hr. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and subsequent electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, U.S.A.). Mouse or rabbit monoclonal antibody of eNOS (Upstate, NY, U.S.A.), sGCa/Sigma-Adrich, CA, U.S.A.., sGCp . (Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.), PDE-5A (BD Tansduction, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.), PKG (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) ROCKII (Upstate, NY, U.S.A.), RhoA (Santa Cruze, CA, U.S.A.) and the loading control protein β-actin (Sigma- Adrich, MO, U.S.A.) were used in our Western blot analysis. [00182] In order to examine the short-term action of treatment in hypoxia, the second branches of the main rat pulmonary artery rings were isolated and cut into 2-3 mm pieces for rapid incubation with SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex/Sildenafil ascorbate complex (10 μιτι), Y27632 (10 μηι) for 24 hrs in wells of an incubation plate in a hypoxic (O2 %: 1 ) or normoxic (O2%: 10) atmosphere as described previously (6, 7). The Western blotting analysis measurements were performed as per lung tissue. [00183] Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining of lung tissues and pulmonary artery [00184] The right lobes of the rat lungs and heart of six rats from each group were cut and soaked in formalin, dehydrated through graded alcohols, and embedded in paraffin wax. The lung tissue specimens fixed with formalin (4 %) were embedded in paraffin for one hour at 4°C, cut into 4^m-thick sections, and subjected to H&E staining before examination by light microscope. In our histopathological study, we measured the thickening of the medial wall of the small intrapulmonary arteries under an Eclipse TE2000-S (Nikon) microscope. In the heart tissues, the 4^m-thick paraffin sections were cut from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and de-paraffmized by immersion in xylene and rehydrated as previously described (Bivalacqua TJ, et al., PLoSONE 8: e68028. doi:10.1371/journal. pone.0068028). The slices were then dyed with H&E. After gently rinsing with water, each slide was dehydrated through graded alcohols and finally soaked in xylene twice. The relative cardiac weight of right ventricle (RV)/[left ventricle (LV)+intraventricular septum (S)] ratio ( i.e. right heart index) was calculated using right ventricle/left ventricle+septum (RV/LV+S). Measurements were obtained with Histolab software (Micro vision Instruments, Evry, France). [00185] Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of eNOS and VEGF in lung tissue and pulmonary artery [00186] For histological analysis, the rat pulmonary right lung sections or pulmonary artery were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 1 hour at 4°C. After washing with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), they were sent for paraffin-embedded serial-sections. Serial cross-sections 7 μιη thick were obtained from the cross-section of each pulmonary artery. Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in an ethanol series. After tissue rehydration, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes, and the sections were gently washed in PBS. Non-specific binding was blocked by incubation with 1% nonimmune bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. [00187] The tissue sections were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with antibody against VEGF (abl442, Millipore) or against eNOS (ab5589, Abeam) diluted 1 :200 in PBS with 1% BSA. After being washed with PBS, the sections were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with biotinylated goat antibody against rabbit (Dako, E-0432) and diluted 1 :200 in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was visualized by the addition of 3-3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) in a working solution of DAB substrate kit for peroxidase (vector lab, SK-4100) at room temperature for 5 minutes. The sections were washed in PBS for 10 minutes between each step, and counterstained with haematoxylin. Lastly, the sections were dehydrated, and after drying were mounted with DAKO aqueous mount (Dako, 003181). [00188] NO metabolites (NOx) production [00189] Production of NO, represented by its metabolite nitrate+nitrite (NOx), in lung tissue extracts was determined using the Griess method (Chung HH et al, Br J Pharmacol 160: 971, 2010; Vascular Pharmacology 53: 239, 2010). The three step Greiss test converts nitrate (NO3~) into nitrite (NO2~), resulting in a total NO2~ concentration from a standard calibration curve. The lung tissue extracts were homogenized, washed with PBS and incubated in a lysis buffer in addition to a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to obtain the extracts of lung proteins. The lung tissue extracts (100 μΐ,) were incubated (37°C) for 30 min with 50 mM (pH 7.4) N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-ethane sulphonic acid buffer (HEPES), flavin adenine dinucleotide (5 μΜ), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (0.1 mM), distilled water (290 μΐ), and nitrate reductase (0.2 U/ml) for the conversion of nitrate into nitrite. The samples were then incubated (25°C,10 min) with Griess reagent [N-(l-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine: 0.2% (w/v), sulphanilamide: 2% (w/v), solubilized in double-distilled water: 95% and phosphoric acid: 5% (v/v)] and the absorbance measured at 540 nm. The levels of nitrite in the lung tissues were calibrated and compared to a sodium nitrite (0~150 μΐ) standard curve. Six independent experiments were carried out and data are reported as the mean ± SEM. [00190] ROS production [00191] Pulmonary ROS was measured using 2'-7'-dichloro- fluorescein (H2DCF-DA, Molecular Probe, USA). Briefly, 10 μΐ of lung tissue extract was diluted 100-fold with cold PBS and labelled with 5 μπιοΙ/L 2'-7'-dichlorofluorescein, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes and put in a centrifuge (1000 rpm) for 5 min. Fluorescence was measured at 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission to determine the concentration of H2O2 (FLUOstar Galaxy, Germany). [00192] Compounds [00193] The anti-eNOS antibody was obtained from BD Biotechnology (New York, USA); anti-PKG antibodies from Santa Cruz (CA, USA); anti-sGCal and ?-actin antibodies and Y27632 from Sigma Chemical Co.. SPAAX-1 was synthesized in our laboratory and whose salt form SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex (7-[2-[4-(2-chlorobenzene)piperazinyl]ethyl]- 1,3-dimethylxanthine · ascorbic acid) was used in the all of experiments in this study. SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex or Sildenafil ascorbate complex (synthesized from BNo.: RSK/616, CADILA HEALTHCARE LTD, India) was dissolved in a vehicle (distilled water containing 0.5 % methyl cellulose). SPAAX-1 ascorbate complex, Sildenafil ascorbate complex and L-ascorbic acid dilutions were made with distilled water. All the other reagents we used were of analytical grade or higher and were obtained from commercial sources. In the in vitro test, L-sodium ascorbate+L-ascorbic acid buffer (Aldrich-Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as an anti-oxidant system. [00194] Statistical evaluation of data [00195] The results were expressed as mean ± SE. Statistical differences were determined by independent and paired Student's f-test in unpaired and paired samples, respectively. Whenever a control group was compared with more than one treated group, one way ANOVA or two way repeated measure ANOVA was used. When the ANOVA showed a statistical difference, the Dunnett's or Student-Newman-Keuls test was applied. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant in all experiments. Analysis of the data and plotting of the figures were done with the aid of SigmaPlot software (Version 8.0, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) and SigmaStat (Version 2.03, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) run on an IBM compatible computer.
