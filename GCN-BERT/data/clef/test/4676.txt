Step 4: (S)-(1-Benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl 2-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylacetate
A stirred suspension of (S)-piperidin-4-ylmethyl 2-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylacetate hydrochloride (5.9 g, 15.61 mmol) in DCM (160 mL) was added with benzaldehyde (2.38 mL, 23.4 mmol) and stirred at 30° C. for 1 hour. Sodium triacetoxyborohydride (6.62 g, 31.2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at 30° C. for 2 hours. Further sodium triacetoxyborohydride (1.65 g, 7.8 mmol) was added and the mixture stirred at 30° C. for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was quenched with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and the organic phase removed. The aqueous phase was extracted with further DCM. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% DCM to 9:1 DCM/methanol) to afford the title compound (13.42 g, 69%).
