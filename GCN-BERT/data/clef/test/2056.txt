TECHNICAL FIELD The inventive concept relates to a composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound and a orally ingestible composition, and more particularly, to a composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound having excellent water dispersibility or water solubility and a orally ingestible composition including the composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound. BACKGROUND ART The global market for functional food offering health benefits has continuously grown at an annual average rate of 6% in the last 5 years due to the spread of global well-being trends and population aging. It seems that the growth of this market will further increase as the number of health-oriented customers has constantly increased. In Korea too the market for functional food has rapidly increased so that the importance of the market has gradually increased. Furthermore, although single functional products have conventionally represented the mainstream, patterns have recently changed, and thus the market for the multi-functional products has taken over from the market for single functional products market and various functional healthy foods have appeared. Such functional healthy foods include many natural products found in nature. Although the majority of natural products have a variety of beneficial effects, such as a strong anti-oxidation function, they also have low water solubility, and thus, the bioavailability thereof upon oral ingestion decreases. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIVE CONCEPT TECHNICAL PROBLEM The inventive concept provides a composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound having excellent water dispersibility or water solubility. The inventive concept provides an orally ingestible composition including the composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound. TECHNICAL SOLUTION According to an aspect of the inventive concept, there is provided a composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound including a poorly water-soluble natural polyphenolic compound (PSNPPC) and saponin, and having water dispersibility or water solubility. The PSNPPC may have a solubility of 0.004 to 0.087. The PSNPPC may include curcumin, silymarin, resveratrol, or a combination thereof. The saponin may include tea saponin, American ginseng saponin, Panax ginseng saponin (leaf), Panax ginseng saponin (root), soy saponin, or a combination thereof. When dissolving the composition, a solubility of the PSNPPC may be in a range of 0.006 to 1.087. An amount of the saponin may be in a range of 25 to 400 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the PSNPPC. According to another aspect of the inventive concept, there is provided an orally ingestible composition including the composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound. The orally ingestible composition may be a functional healthy food or a medicine in a form of a tablet, a capsule, a liquid formulation, or a beverage. An amount of the saponin in the orally ingestible composition may be in a range of 0.4 to 50 wt%. ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS The composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound according to an exemplary embodiment has excellent water dispersibility or water solubility, and thus, when being used for oral ingestion, the bioavailabilty thereof is high. BEST MODE Hereinafter, a composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound according to an exemplary embodiment will be described in detail. According to an aspect of one or more exemplary embodiments, there is provided a composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound includes a poorly water-soluble natural polyphenolic compound (PSNPPC) and saponin and have water dispersibility or water solubility. In the present specification, "water dispersibility" refers to a nature in which the composition containing a PSNPPC exists in an emulsion state in water, and "water solubility" refers to a nature in which the composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound exists in a solution state in water. The PSNPPC may have a solubility of 0.004 to 0.087. In the present specification. "solubility" refers to an amount (mg) of a solute (PSNPPC) that dissolves in 1mL of water at 37°C, which is similar to a human body temperature. The PSNPPC may have a physiological function. The PSNPPC may include curcumin, silymarin, resveratrol, or a combination thereof. The curcumin may be derived from an extract of a turmeric root, and the silymarin may be derived from an extract of milk thistle, and the resveratrol may be derived from an extract of grapes or the like. The saponin may have a physiological function, such as an immunopotentiating function and a metabolism promoting function, and furthermore, increase water dispersibility or water solubility of the PSNPPC. The saponin may include tea saponin, American ginseng saponin, Panax ginseng saponin (leaf), Panax ginseng saponin (root), soy saponin, or a combination thereof. When dissolving the composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound, a solubility of the PSNPPC may be in a range of 0.006 to 1.087. When a solubility of the PSNPPC is within this range, the bioavailability of the PSNPPC may increase. In the present specification, "solubility of PSNPPC, when dissolving a composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound" means an amount (mg) of PSNPPC that is dissolved in water from among components of the composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound, when adding the composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound to 1 mL of water at 37°C. An amount of the saponin may be in a range of 25 to 400 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the PSNPPC. When an amount of the saponin is within this range, water dispersibility and water solubility of the PSNPPC increases, thereby improving bioavailability thereof. The composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound configured as described above according to an exemplary embodiment may intactly maintain its active ingredients when dispersed or dissolved in water, while the PSNPPC thereof is not physicochemically changed, and may be used for various purposes, as a method of preparation is simple. According to another aspect of one or more exemplary embodiments, there is provided an orally ingestible composition including the composition containing a natural polyphenolic compound. The orally ingestible composition may be a functional healthy food or a medicine in a form of a tablet, a capsule, liquid formulation, or beverage. In the present specification, "liquid formulation" means a liquid preparation that may be in a typical liquid form or show consistency, and is distributed while filled in a container in a form of ampoules or vials having a capacity of 10 to 30 mL, and "beverage" means a thing that is in a typical drink form and distributed while filled in a container having a capacity of 75 to 120 mL. The tablet may be prepared by using a conventional preparation method, such as a direct compression. In particular, the tablet may be prepared by mixing the orally ingestible composition homogeneously, and then compressing the resultant by using a tablet molding compressor. The capsule may be prepared by mixing the orally ingestible composition homogeneously, and then, filling a hard capsule with the resultant. The liquid formulation and beverage may be prepared by adding the orally ingestible composition to purified water, which confers a unique smell and flavor to the composition, and the resultant may be filled in a container and packed to allow easy drinking. An amount of the saponin included in the orally ingestible composition may be in a range of 0.4 to 50 wt%. When an amount of the saponin is within this range, bioavailability of the PSNPPC may increase, and an orally ingestible composition providing an excellent physiological function may be obtained.
