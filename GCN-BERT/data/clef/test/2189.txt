Example 1B
rac-(2R,3R,4R,5R)-tert-butyl 4-amino-3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate
A solution of rac-(2R,3S,4R,5R)-tert-butyl 3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-4-nitro-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Example 1A, 1.04 g, 2.268 mmol) in acetic acid (11.68 mL, 204 mmol) and ethyl acetate (66.6 mL, 680 mmol) was treated with zinc (2.224 g, 34.0 mmol) and stirred at 55Â° C. for 1 hour, cooled, diluted with ethyl acetate and filtered to remove the solids. The filtrate was concentrated to dryness. The residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The ethyl acetate layer was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. Purification via flash chromatography on a 24 g silica gel cartridge, eluting with ethyl acetate/methanol (9:1) in heptane provided the title compound 0.95 g (98% yield).
