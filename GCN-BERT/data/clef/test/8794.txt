Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a prepreg for a laminate and a metal-clad laminate each of which uses a vinyl compound having a specific structure. More specifically, the resin composition for a laminate, is excellent in low dielectric characteristics and heat resistance and is capable of giving a prepreg which has no tackiness and excellent workability and is excellent in moldability when used for producing a metal-clad laminate. Therefore, it is suitable for producing telecommunications related equipment parts requiring a low loss of signals in a high frequency band or substrates of printed wiring boards used in computers having an operation frequency of more than several hundreds MHz, etc. Prior Arts of the Invention In recent years, the signal band of information telecommunications equipment such as PHS, portable phones, etc., and the CPU clock time of computers have reached GHz bands and high frequencies are increasingly used. The dielectric loss of electric signals is in proportion to the product of the square root of the relative permittivity of an insulator which forms circuits, the dielectric loss tangent of the insulator, and the frequency of signals used. Accordingly, as the frequency of signals used becomes higher, the dielectric loss increases. The dielectric loss damps electric signals and therefore impairs the reliability of the signals. For this reason, it is required to select a material having a low dielectric constant and a low dielectric loss tangent as an insulator for preventing the above impairment. Removal of a polar group in a molecular structure is effective for lowering the dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent of insulators. There are proposed a fluororesin, curable polyolefin, a cyanate ester type resin, curable polyphenylene oxide, allyl-modified polyphenylene ether (PPE), polyether imide modified with divinyl naphthalene, etc. However, the use of a thermoplastic resin such as PPE can provide low dielectric characteristics but has problems in workability, moldability and heat resistance. Further, as for a low molecular weight styrene compound such as divinyl benzene, this resin, when singly used, gives a cured product which is too hard and is therefore fragile, so that a prepreg obtained therefrom is insufficient in tackiness in some cases (for example, JP-A-2003-12710). Compositions excellent in dielectric characteristics have high melting points and high softening points, so that they require a high temperature and a high pressure for molding, the moldability thereof is insufficient and cured products therefrom are too hard and are fragile and have problems in adhesiveness and resistance to soldering. Therefore, further improvements have been desired. As an example using vinyl compounds, there is proposed a method using polyether imide and a vinyl-divinyl copolymer for improving dielectric characteristics (JP-A-5-156159). However, there is a defect in that, during the production of the vinyl-divinyl copolymer, its monomer is apt to volatilize, which changes its constitution. There is also a problem that a cured product produced is fragile. Further, there is proposed a composition provided with flexibility by using a both terminals divinyl compound having an alkylene ether structure in its center, as a curing agent, into a novolak type aromatic hydrocarbon- formaldehyde resin (JP-A-5-78552), while its dielectric characteristics are unknown. Summary of the Invention A resin composition for a laminate is described which composition has a low dielectric constant and a low dielectric loss tangent, is capable of giving a prepreg having no tackiness and does not decrease properties such as moldability and heat resistance, and a prepreg and a metal-clad laminate using the resin composition, for coping with recent usage modes using high frequencies.

The present invention provides a prepreg for a laminate, which prepreg comprises a resin composition containing a vinyl compound of the formula (1) and a thermosetting resin and/or a thermoplastic resin and a polymer base material, and a metal-clad laminate obtainable by using the above prepreg. Detailed Description of the Invention The present inventors have made diligent studies and as a result found that a prepreg which is capable of giving a laminate having a low dielectric constant and a low dielectric loss tangent and has excellent moldability with no tackiness can be obtained by using a terminal vinyl compound of a bifunctional phenylene ether oligomer which compound has excellent dielectric characteristics and heat resistance of a Polyphenylene ether structure, has a number average molecular weight of 500 - 3, 000 as required and has a specific structure. On the basis of the above finding, the present inventors have completed the present invention. The present invention will be explained in detail hereinafter. First, the resin composition for a laminate, contains a vinyl compound of the formula (1). In the formula (1), R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 are the same or different and represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group, a halogenated alkyl group or a phenyl group. -(O-X-O)- represents a moiety of the formula (2), in which R8, R9, R10, R14 and R15 are the same or different and represent a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 6 or less carbon atoms or a phenyl group and R11, R12 and R13 are the same or different and represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 6 or less carbon atoms or a phenyl group, or a moiety of the formula (3), in which R16, R17, R22 and R23 are the same or different and represent a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 6 or less carbon atoms or a phenyl group, R18, R19, R20 and R21 are the same or different and represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 6 or less carbon atoms or a phenyl group, and A is a linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon having 20 or less carbon atoms, or -(O-X-O)- represents at least two kinds of moieties of the formula (2) and/or the formula (3). -(Y-O)- is a moiety of the formula (4) or a random arrangement of at least two kinds of moieties of the formula (4), in which R24 and R25 are the same or different and represent a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 6 or less carbon atoms or a phenyl group and R26 and R27 are the same or different and represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 6 or less carbon atoms or a phenyl group. Z is an organic group having at least one carbon atom which may contain an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom, a sulfur atom or a halogen atom. Each of a and b is an integer of 0 to 30, provided that at least one of a and b is not 0. Each of c and d is an integer of 0 or 1. In the compounds of the formula (1), preferred is a compound of the formula (1) wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 are hydrogen atoms, R8, R9, R10, R14, R15, R16, R17, R22 and R23 are alkyl groups having 3 or less carbon atoms, R11, R12, R13, R18, R19, R20 and R21 are hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having 3 or less carbon atoms, Z are methylene groups, and each of c and d is 1. When the number average molecular weight of the compound of the formula (1) is smaller than 500, a prepreg obtained therefrom is poor in tackiness and it is hard to impart dielectric characteristics. When the number average molecular weight is larger than 3,000, the melting point increases, which decreases the solubility or reactivity thereof to a solvent and therefore worsens moldability. For these reasons, the number average molecular weight is preferably 500 to 3,000. The amount of the vinyl compound of the formula (1) to be used is not specially limited. However, when the content thereof is small, desired low dielectric characteristics, heat resistance and tackiness cannot be obtained. For this reason, the content of the vinyl compound of the formula (1) in the resin composition for a laminate is preferably 10 to 100 % by weight, more preferably 30 to 100% by weight, further preferably 50 to 100 % by weight. The process for producing the vinyl compound of the formula (1) used in the resin composition for a laminate of the present invention is not specially limited and the vinyl compound of the formula (1) may be produced by any process. For example, it can be produced by processes disclosed in JP-A-2004-059644, JP-A-2004-067727 and Japanese patent application No. 2003-110687.
