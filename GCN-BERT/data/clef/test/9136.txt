FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to interactive advertising and more specifically to computer games allowing advertisers to market their products, prize giveaways, coupons and the like using a game of chance in an interactive manner. To play the game, a gamer may use for example a mobile device's image capturing means for scanning at least one coded advertising image within a coded frame for which an interactive game application animates a dynamic array of game frames and randomly selects a game frame from the dynamic array for display. The randomly selected game frame may comprise of multimedia content for vouchers, prizes, giveaways, that may be redeemed for cash or other prizes. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART In today's age where we are constantly bombarded with all types of advertisements, e.g. television commercials, radio advertisements, print advertisements in newspapers and magazines, online advertisements that reach your “Inbox” or appear as pop-ups and banners, text messages automatically sent to your mobile phone, we generally filter and most often disregard information received from multiple platforms as it creates cyber clutter. This holds true for all types of marketing, whether for restaurants, airline tickets, subscriptions, insurance and/or financial products. Thus there needs to be an efficient system and method for business owners to market and promote their products and promotions, etc., in a manner that will be well received and reviewed by the general public. Many advertisers resort to games, e.g. MONOPOLY®, where gamers can redeem prizes or vouchers with matching game pieces. Others advertise use printed mailers, or coupon codes or other games. However, the idea of advertising using games has heretofore been limited to printed materials and has advanced minimally with developing technology. Therefore, there is a need to incorporate technological advancements in advertising strategies. This invention satisfies these long felt needs in a new and novel manner and solves the foregoing problems that the prior art has been unable to resolve. For a further and more fully detailed understanding of the present invention, various objects and advantages thereof, reference is made to the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.

FIGS. 2A-2D show an exemplary embodiment of the game 202 of invention whereby the graphic media 140 includes a printed advertisement on a drinking cup. In the exemplary embodiment, the game 202 is an electronic game with a virtual wheel barrel 122 arranged in a rotating circumferential arrangement. It is understood that the dynamic array 122 of game frames 112, 112′ could have been displayed as a scrolling arrangement, a dynamic matrix, a pop-up arrangement or any other gaming arrangement that are well known and used in the arts and to be invented. A gamer may start playing the game 202 by launching the interactive game app 110, which controls game frames 112, 112′ corresponding to at least one coded advertising image 114 within a coded frame 116 that includes at least one or more hyperlinks 118, 118′ or icons 120, 120′ embedded within. Once the interactive game app 110 is launched by hovering a network enabled computer device's 132 image capturing means 126, e.g. a cellular phone 102, at, near, or over the scanable, at least one coded frame image 114, the interactive game app 110 that is in electronic communication with the processor 104 issues a command 134 to the computer processor 104 to activate the image capturing means 126 to scan the at least one coded advertising image 114 within the coded frame 116 with the at least one embedded hyperlink 118 or icon 120 embedded therein. Image capturing means 122 captures an image 204 of the coded frame image 114 and the interactive game app 110 issues a command 134 to the computer processor 104 to activate the displaying means 128 to display the dynamic array 122 of game frames 112, 112′ for the game 202, which the displaying means 128 displays. In some embodiments, as soon as the dynamic array 122 of game frames 112, 112′ is displayed the interactive game app 110 automatically animates the dynamic array 122. In this manner, the gamer has minimal input as to when or how long to animate the dynamic array 122, or control over the game's 202 resulting outcomes, i.e. randomly selected game frame 124. In other embodiments the interactive game app 110 first receives at least one or more input commands 134, 134′ as to when to activate the dynamic array 122 of a plurality of game frames 112, 112′, and for how long to animate the dynamic array 122. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, the display of the dynamic array 122 may be prefaced with game playing instructions for selecting a virtual radio button 206, e.g. a radio button 206 marked “PLAY” or “SPIN”, or denoted graphically as an arrow (“>”) so that the random selection of a game frame 112 may begin. The command 134 to activate the dynamic array 122 may be inputted using a touchscreen, or using a radio button, pointing device, mouse, roller ball, arrow keys, a gesture recognition device or any other controller that is well known and used in the arts for command 134 inputs. In some embodiments, the length of time for animation is derived from how long e.g. a finger gesture, is detected as remaining on, for example, the radio button 206 to commence the animation. In some embodiments, an advertisement comprising of multimedia content 124 may be displayed prior to the game being started, i.e. prior to the interactive game app 110 receiving a command 134 to animate the dynamic array 122 of game frames 112, 112′ or automatically animating the dynamic array 122 of game frames 112, 112′. Here, advertisers may use that window to broadcast their advertisement, e.g. multimedia content 124 that may be in audio, video, pictorial, text message, graph, or any other format as deemed appropriate on the mobile device 102. In either embodiments, the interactive game app's 110 computer executable instruction code 108′ animates the dynamic array 122 of a plurality of game frames 112, 112′ by animating the virtual wheel barrel 122 to virtually rotate and display the spinning virtual wheel barrel 122 until the interactive game app 110 randomly selects a game frame 112 from the dynamic array 122, which gets displayed. The number of game frames 112, 112′ is unlimited and only limited by the game creator's choices. Upon selection of the randomly selected game frame 112, the interactive game app 110 communicates the request for display to the processor 104, which activates the displaying means 128 to display the selected at least one game frame 112 and its respective at least one multimedia content 124. In some embodiments, the at least one multimedia content 124 may comprise of, for example, pertinent advertising information, coupons, voucher, or videos, redeeming game pieces and the like that may be displayed in text, video, or any other multimedia format. In some embodiments, the multimedia content 124 may not be stored with the interactive game app 110 and access to the multimedia content 124 requires using the embedded hyperlinks 118, 118′ and/or icons 120, 120′ to access stored content from the advertiser by hyperlinking to the advertiser's websites or advertiser provided Uniform Resource Locator (URLs) over the computer network 130. As shown in FIGS. 2B-2D, the exemplary randomly selected game frame 112 include multimedia content 124 providing for the gamer to redeem prizes, e.g. free burger, free medium fries, or free nuggets. Since this is a game 202 of chance, gamer has no assurance that the desired game frame 112, e.g. free burger, will be the randomly selected as the interactive game app 110 could easily have randomly selected a game frame 112 with no winnings, e.g. “SORRY TRY AGAIN” as shown in FIG. 2D.
