Example Compound 62
2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(pyridin-4-yl)acetate
2-(pyridin-4-yl)acetic acid hydrochloride (31.6 mg, 0.2 mmol) was suspended in DCM (4 mL) under Argon, cooled to 0 °C and added trimethylamine (24 µL, 0.2 mmol). After 20 minutes a clear solution is observed and EDCI (35.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) and DMAP (4.6 mg, 0.04 mmol) followed by N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (42.8 mg, 0.2 mmol), synthesized as reported in Example 1. The mixture was left stirring overnight and then diluted with water and extracted 3 times with DCM. The organic phase was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, concentrated and purified twice by column chromatography (5% MeOH in DCM) to yield 30.8 mg of the title compound (48%).
