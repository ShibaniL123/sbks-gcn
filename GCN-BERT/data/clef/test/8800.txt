The present invention relates to the use of aluminium dibromosalicylate for the preparation of organic plastics characterized by good thermal insulation and reduced inflammability. Particular aspect of the present invention is the process for preparing expandable plastics based on polymers of aromatic vinyl compounds (polystyrene compounds), that allow to obtain products with improved performance characteristics which are obtained from their foamed form and the flame retardant composition designated for the preparation of such materials and products. Technological development within the last century led to the use of synthetic polymers based on carbon for the production of daily necessities for housekeeping and public institutions. The foams of polymers of aromatic vinyl compounds cope very well now, first of all as thermal insulations for buildings, having thermal conductivity in the range of 0,030 - 0,045 W/m.K (depending on the volume density of the foams and additive contents). High inflammability degree of these materials means that their presence would create risk, in particular in situations where the use of given object is connected with a high ignition risk. There are many standards determining fire-safety requirements for apartments, electric equipment elements, interior arrangement of the apartments and cars. An achievement of required fire-safety standards (most often EN 13 501-1 standard, E class or DIN 4102, B2 standard) frequently requires the use of so called flame retardants (FR). There is known a two-stage production process of the foams of polymers of aromatic vinyl compounds (polystyrene compounds), wherein the first step comprises preparation of particles (granules) in the process of suspension polymerization of styrene (in suspension), wherein an expanding agent is uniformly dispersed. In the second step the foam is formed from the granules (EPS, expanded polystyrene foam). In this process the flame retardant is incorporated into a mixture that is reacted during the polymerization. The second possibility how to obtain polystyrene foam is used an extrusion process. A polystyrene melt is impregnated with a fluid blowing agent, usually an isomeric pentane mixture or different low blowing hydrocarbones, at high temperature and pressure. Additives, as for example flame retardants, pigments, lubricants, nucleating agents or other substances, can be added through a side or main extruder. After the additive mixer, the homogeneous, blowing agents and additive loaded melt is extruded through die-holes and cut by a rotating knife in an underwater pelletizer to yield micro pellets (granulated EPS production process, gEPS) or XPS which begins as a molten material also but that is pressed out of a form into sheets. The group of the most often used flame retardants of polymers of aromatic vinyl compounds (polystyrene compounds) type comprises retardants based on halogen compounds. Necessary amount of the flame retardant depends on its effectiveness and is ranged from 0,5 to 1 %. Almost all flame retardants reduce Tg values of polystyrene that imply the reduction of thermal strength of the foams. This effect is frequently compensated by addition of the compounds forming cross-linked structures, such as divinylbenzene. Some of the flame retardants show also tendencies to reduce the molar mass of polystyrene. Because the polystyrene foam is subjected to the process in reduced temperatures, for these purposes aliphatic compounds containing bromine can be used. The useful additives used for EPS grading appeared pentabromophenyl 2,3-dibromopropyl ether, bis(2,3-dibromopropyl) tetrabromobisphenol An ether and bis(2,3-dibromopropyl) tetrabromophthalate. Usually, the most often used flame retardants for EPS designed for the production of insulating plates is 1,2,5,6,9,10-hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) due to the necessity to meet the domestic standards of fire protection in the building engineering. A threat to the possibility of further application of this flame retardant will be recognition this compound as a toxic substance for the aqueous environments and of high bio-accumulation potential. Despite described above solutions, it should be recognized that the plastics inflammability is still significant technical problem requiring better solution. In particular, it is desirable to provide new substances and/or their compositions suitable for reducing the inflammability of organic plastics, especially EPS. In the case of EPS it is also desirable to avoid undesirable deterioration of mechanical properties of the material, which occurs in the case of using known refining substances. The toxicity of refined plastics should be also reduced. Unexpectedly, indicated technical problem was solved in the present invention. The present invention relates to the use of aluminium dibromosalicylate (Al-diBr-Sal), the process for preparing organic plastics and the flame retardant composition for its preparation, technical characteristics of which are defined in appended patent claims. The base of disclosed invention is the use of aluminium dibromosalicylate compound as the additive incorporated directly into the suspension in polymerization of produced organic plastic, in particular in the suspension polymerization of expandable polystyrene, in order to improve its heat-insulating properties and reduce its inflammability. According to the present invention aluminium dibromosalicylate may be thus used for grading the following organic plastics: polystyrene and copolymers of styrene with dienes or acrylic monomers, for example copolymer of styrene and butadiene, styrene and methacrylate, or styrene and maleic anhydride. Aluminium dibromosalicylate may be used as new compound for reducing the inflammability of foamable polystyrene (EPS), that is produced using the suspension polymerization method, wherein this compound is added to the process in dispersed in styrene or mixture of styrene and co-monomers form. Physical properties, in particular mechanical parameters of the polystyrene foams formed in the extrusion moulding process with addition of new flame retardant, i.e. aluminium dibromosalicylate, may be improved by intermixing polystyrene with other polymers of thermoplastic properties, which are miscible with polystyrene or miscible as a result of using so called compatibilizer. The following polymers may be used: polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMM), polycarbonate (PC), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), polyethersulfone (PES), polyetherketone (PEK) or polyphenylether (PPE), in the weight content in ratio to polystyrene in the range from 1 to 99 %. Another advantage of using this material is its lower toxicity for the environment as distinguished from currently used flame retardants. The particular aspect of the present invention refers to the production of expandable polystyrene granulate using the suspension polymerization method of styrene with an optional addition of other co-monomers such as α-methylstyrene, alkylated or halogenated monomers of styrene on the benzene nucleus, acrylonitrile, acrylic, methacrylic, maleic acid esters with alcohols having from 2 to 6 C atoms and in the presence of one or more organic peroxy initiators added in amounts from 0,10 to 1,4, preferably from 0,20 to 0,60 parts by weight based on monomer, with a half-life of one hour at the temperature from 80 to 130°C. Other known free-radical polymerization initiators, for example azobisisobutyronitrile or 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-diphenylbutane, can be used simultaneously with these peroxy initiators. Moreover, in order to improve processing characteristics of materials it can be decided to add a monomer with minimal two double bonds able to be polymerized through free-radical polymerization in amount from 10-3 to 10-2 parts by weight based on monomer (EP 0488040 A). In order to ensure the stability of the suspension following the procedure according to the present invention it can be used known substances such as colloidal stabilizing agents soluble in water, such as eg. polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, etc. or inorganic stabilizing agents, insoluble in water, such as eg. magnesium hydroxide, calcium or magnesium phosphate, bentonite, barium sulphate, etc. Molecular weight distribution in polymer matrix can be substantially controlled by means of amounts of added initiators, the temperature of polymerization, chemical composition of the expanding agent, its addition at different stages of the polymerization process, addition of popular molecular weight regulators, such as eg. mercaptans, α-methylstyrene dimer, carbon bromide or 2,6-di-tert-butyl-para-cresole. As expanding agents it can be used from 3 to 11% by weight saturated aliphatic or cyclic hydrocarbons, such as eg. n-butane, isobutane, n-pentane, isopentane, cyclopentane or the mixture of hexanes, preferably the mixture of n-pentane with addition of maximally 30% by weight of isopentane. In order to ensure extinguishing of the expandable polystyrene, it is used the addition of aluminium dibromosalicylate with a concentration of a maximum 5% by weight (based on styrene), whereas in order to improve its extinguishing and reducing the amounts of additive extinguishing substances in polymer it is added substances exhibiting the synergetic effect (dicumyl peroxide, 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-diphenylbutane). Used aluminium dibromosalicylate should contain minimally 43% bounded bromine, whereas the ash content should not exceed 10%, with an average molecular size d50 in the range of 0,5 to 15 micrometers, wherein d90 should not exceed the values of 100 micrometers. The obtained material meets the requirements specified in DIN4102, B2 standard for inflammability of the polymeric foams, and its thermal conductivity , which depends on the used concentration of aluminium dibromosalicylate, reaches the values from 32 to 35 mW/m.K. Moreover, it can be used other auxiliary substances, such as for example polyethylene waxes, olefin polymers with different molecular weights, fat acid amides, pigments, inorganic and organic fillers, and substances that enhance thermal resistance of the foam products, such as eg. polymerized alkylated 1,4-phenylethers or polymerized 1,4-phenylsulfides. For the purpose of better illustration of its essence, the selected embodiments of the claimed invention were discussed in the following examples, which, however, are not intended to be identified with its full scope. Example 1. The method of preparation of aluminium dibromosalicylate Aluminium dibromosalicylate (Al-diBr-Sal) as a new compound rendering inflammability of organic plastics may be obtained in the two-step or three-step process, in the form of mono- or di-base: C6H2Br2OHCOOAl(OH)2. In the first step, dibromosalicylic acid is obtained in the reaction of salicylic acid with bromine (bromination reaction into ortho and para position). C6H4OH(COOH) + Br2 > C6H2Br2OH(COOH) The second step is neutralization reaction of dibromosalicylic acid with aluminium hydroxide. In the reaction of dibromosalicylic acid and aluminium hydroxide there is formed stoichiometric mixture of two bases: mono- and di-base of aluminium dibromosalicylate of a formula C6H2Br2OHCOOAl(OH)2. The theoretical composition of the mixture is 45% of the di-base and 55 % of the mono-base of aluminium dibromosalicylate. The obtained mixture is in the form of white powder, consisting of particles of dimensions of 30 µm. In the third step, the substance is subjected to grinding in the pulverizer to obtain the particles of dimensions in the range of 1 to 10 µm. Additionally, aluminium dibromosalicylate can be subjected to the surface treatment by means of plasma in order to increase its hydrophobic properties. Example 2.
