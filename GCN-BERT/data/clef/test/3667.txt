(Reference Example 9) Synthesis of ethyl 1-methyl-1H-imidazole-2-carboxylate:
Triethylamine (3.40 mL, 24.4 mmol) and ethyl chloroformate (2.34 mL, 24.4 mmol) were added to a solution of 1-methyl-1H-imidazole (1.00 g, 12.2 mmol) in acetonitrile (4.0 mL) at 0Â°C and the reaction liquid was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction liquid was filtered through Celite and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain ethyl 1-methyl-1H-imidazole-2-carboxylate (1.50 g, 9.73 mmol, 80%) as a white solid.
