TECHNICAL FIELD This disclosure relates to a fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article comprising carbon fibers and organic fibers, a fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material, and a method of producing the fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material. BACKGROUND Molded articles comprising reinforcement fibers and a thermoplastic resin are lightweight and have excellent mechanical properties, and thus have been widely used, for example, in sports applications, aerospace applications, and general industrial applications. As such reinforcement fibers, metal fibers such as aluminum fibers and stainless fibers, inorganic fibers such as silicon carbide fibers and carbon fibers, organic fibers such as aramid fibers and poly p-phenylene benzoxazole (PBO) fibers, and the like are used. From the standpoint of the balance among specific strength, specific rigidity, and lightness, carbon fibers are preferred, and in particular, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon fibers are preferably used. The mechanical properties of a carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article can be enhanced, for example, by increasing the amount of carbon fibers, but an increased amount of carbon fibers tends to result in non-uniform distribution of the carbon fibers in the carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article, often causing a reduction in impact strength. Thus, alternatively, the mechanical properties of a carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article can be enhanced, for example, by adding organic fibers having flexibility and high elongation at break in addition to the carbon fibers. As a composite fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin pellet comprising organic fibers and inorganic fibers that can provide a molded body with high rigidity and high impact resistance, for example, a composite fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin pellet is disclosed, wherein the ratio of organic fibers/inorganic fibers is 1/1 to 1/10; the ratio of thermoplastic resin/reinforcement fibers is 95/5 to 60/40; and the reinforcement fibers are present twisted and substantially aligned along the longer direction of the pellet together with the thermoplastic resin (see, for example, JP 2009-024057 A). Furthermore, as a long-fiber reinforced composite resin composition having high mechanical strength and provided with conductivity, a long-fiber reinforced composite resin composition comprising an olefin resin, organic long fibers, and carbon fibers is disclosed (see, for example, JP 2009-114332 A). Unfortunately, molded articles obtained using these techniques are still poor in impact strength and low-temperature impact strength. As a resin composition having fuel barrier properties consistent with impact resistance, a resin composition is disclosed, comprising a mixture of a thermoplastic resin and 4- to 20 mm-long fibers having a melting point higher than that of the thermoplastic resin or being infusible (see, for example, US 2006/068141 A1). Unfortunately, molded articles obtained using such a technique are poor in mechanical properties, particularly, impact strength and low-temperature impact strength. Thus, it is desirable to develop, by a convenient method, a fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article comprising a thermoplastic resin as a matrix, which is excellent in mechanical properties, particularly, impact strength and low-temperature impact strength, and can exhibit high impact properties. SUMMARY We thus provide: a fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article, comprising 5 to 45 parts by weight of carbon fibers (A), 1 to 45 parts by weight of organic fibers (B), and 20 to 94 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin (C) based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the carbon fibers (A), the organic fibers (B), and the thermoplastic resin (C),wherein the carbon fibers (A) in the fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article have an average fiber length (LA) of 0.3 to 1.5 mm, and an average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (DA), which is a distance from a starting point to an end point of the carbon fibers (A), and the average fiber length (LA) satisfy relationship [1], andthe organic fibers (B) in the fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article have an average fiber length (LB) of 1.5 to 4 mm, and an average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (DB), which is a distance from a starting point to an end point of the organic fibers (B), and the average fiber length (LB) satisfy relationship [2]: [in-line-formulae]0.9×LA≦DA≦LA [1][/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]0.1×LB≦DB≦0.9×LB [2].[/in-line-formulae] Furthermore, the fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material has either of the following constitutions: A fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material, comprising: 5 to 45 parts by weight of carbon fibers (A), 1 to 45 parts by weight of organic fibers (B), 20 to 93 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin (C), and 1 to 20 parts by weight of a compound (D) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (C) based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the carbon fibers (A), the organic fibers (B), the thermoplastic resin (C), and the compound (D) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (C), wherein the thermoplastic resin (C) is contained at the outer side of a composite (F) obtained by impregnating a fiber bundle (E) comprising the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) with the compound (D); the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) are unevenly distributed in a cross section of the fiber bundle (E); and the length of the fiber bundle (E) and the length of the fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material are substantially the same; ora fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material, comprising: a carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material (X) comprising 5 to 45 parts by weight of carbon fibers (A), 94 to 35 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin (C), and 1 to 20 parts by weight of a compound (D) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (C) based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the carbon fibers (A), the thermoplastic resin (C), and the compound (D) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (C), wherein the thermoplastic resin (C) is contained at the outer side of a composite (F) obtained by impregnating the carbon fibers (A) with the compound (D), and the length of the carbon fibers (A) and the length of the carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material are substantially the same; and an organic fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material (Y) comprising 1 to 45 parts by weight of organic fibers (B), 94 to 35 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin (G), and 1 to 20 parts by weight of a compound (H) based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the organic fibers (B), the thermoplastic resin (G), and the compound (H) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (G).A method of producing the fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material, comprising at least the step of dry-blending the carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material (X) and the organic fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material (Y). The fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article, in which the carbon fibers and the organic fibers each satisfy the specific fiber length described above, produces a high reinforcing effect and has high conductivity and high mechanical properties, particularly, impact strength and low-temperature impact strength. The fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article is very useful for electrical and electronic equipment, office automation equipment, household electrical appliances, housings, automotive parts, and the like.

DESCRIPTION OF SYMBOLS 1: Carbon fiber 2: Starting point of carbon fiber 1 3: End point of carbon fiber 1 4: Distance between two edges of carbon fiber 1 5: Organic fiber 6: Starting point of organic fiber 5 7: End point of organic fiber 5 8: Distance between two edges of organic fiber 5 9: Carbon fiber 10: Organic fiber 11: Thermoplastic resin DETAILED DESCRIPTION The fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molded article (hereinafter also referred to as “molded article”) comprises at least carbon fibers (A), organic fibers (B), and a thermoplastic resin (C). Furthermore, the molded article has a structure comprising the carbon fibers (A), the organic fibers (B) present in the curved form, and the thermoplastic resin (C). The carbon fibers (A) are continuous reinforcement fiber bundle and serve as a reinforcement material to provide the molded article with high mechanical properties. The organic fibers (B) are also continuous reinforcement fiber bundle and have flexibility. The organic fibers (B), due to their flexibility, are less likely to break during molding, and likely to be present in the curved form in the molded article while keeping their long fiber length. Thus, compared to a fiber bundle composed of the carbon fibers (A) alone, which are rigid, brittle, less prone to entanglement, and prone to breakage, a fiber bundle comprising the organic fibers (B) can serve as a reinforcement material to provide the molded article with high impact strength and high low-temperature impact strength. The thermoplastic resin (C), which is a matrix resin having relatively high viscosity and excellent physical properties such as toughness, firmly holds the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in the molded article. The molded article has a structure in which the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) are contained in the thermoplastic resin (C), wherein the carbon fibers (A) are present in a state where a straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber is substantially equal to its fiber length, whereas the organic fibers (B) are present in a state where a straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber is shorter than its fiber length, i.e., in a curved state. “A straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber” herein refers to a straight-line distance from a starting point, one edge of a single fiber, to an end point, the other edge of the single fiber. The rigid fiber and the flexible fiber are in different states in the molded article. We paid attention to the straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber which may be used as an indicator of the curved state of a fiber. For example, FIG. 1 shows the fiber length and the straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber of the carbon fibers (A) in the molded article. FIG. 2 shows the fiber length and the straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber of the organic fibers (B) in the molded article. In FIG. 1, a symbol 1 represents the carbon fiber (A); a symbol 2 represents the starting point of the carbon fiber 1; a symbol 3 represents the end point of the carbon fiber 1; and a symbol 4 represents the distance D between two edges of the carbon fiber 1. In FIG. 2, a symbol 5 represents the organic fiber (B); a symbol 6 represents the starting point of the organic fiber 5; a symbol 7 represents the end point of the organic fiber 5; and a symbol 8 represents the distance D between two edges of the organic fiber 5. As shown in FIG. 1, the carbon fiber (A) typically has a straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber that is equal to its fiber length, and on the other hand, as shown in FIG. 2, the organic fiber (B), which is curved in the molded article, may have a straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber that is different from its fiber length. For the molded article, the ratio of a falling weight impact strength at −20° C. (I−20° C.) to a falling weight impact strength at 23° C. (I23° C.) is preferably 0.8 or more, which can reduce the decrease in falling weight impact strength at a low temperature. The falling weight impact strength can be determined by performing a falling weight impact test using a weight with a round tup at its tip under the following conditions: weight, 5.1356 kg; falling speed, 0.5 msec; and test temperatures, 23° C. and −20° C. Furthermore, for the molded article, the end face of the organic fibers (B) at break preferably has an inclination with respect to a perpendicular plane to the fiber axis. In this case, the organic fibers (B) are stretch broken at break of the molded article, which allows absorption of a larger amount of energy, leading to improved impact strength. When the organic fibers (B) are present in the molded article with less entanglement between the organic fibers (B) or between the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B), the end face of the organic fibers (B) at break can have an inclination with respect to a perpendicular plane to the fiber axis. The end face of the carbon fibers (A) is typically perpendicular to the fiber axis and does not have an inclination with respect to a perpendicular plane to the fiber axis. The form of a fiber broken-out section can be observed, for example, by a method in which a cross-section perpendicular to the longer direction of the organic fibers (B) in the molded article is observed under a scanning electron microscope at a magnification of 2,000×, and the micrograph obtained is subjected to image processing and analyzed. The molded article contains the carbon fibers (A) in an amount of 5 to 45 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the carbon fibers (A), the organic fibers (B), and the thermoplastic resin (C). If the amount of the carbon fibers (A) is less than 5 parts by weight, the molded article will have reduced mechanical properties, particularly, flexural properties and impact strength. The amount of the carbon fibers (A) is preferably 10 parts by weight or more. If the amount of the carbon fibers (A) is more than 45 parts by weight, the dispersibility of the carbon fibers (A) in the molded article will be reduced, often causing a reduction in mechanical properties, particularly, impact strength of the molded article. The amount of the carbon fibers (A) is preferably 30 parts by weight or less. Examples of the type of the carbon fibers (A) include, but are not limited to, PAN-based carbon fibers, pitch-based carbon fibers, cellulose-based carbon fibers, vapor-grown carbon fibers, and graphitized fibers thereof. The PAN-based carbon fibers are carbon fibers made from polyacrylonitrile fibers. The pitch-based carbon fibers are carbon fibers made from petroleum tar or petroleum pitch. The cellulose-based carbon fibers are carbon fibers made from materials such as viscose rayon and cellulose acetate. The vapor-grown carbon fibers are carbon fibers made from materials such as hydrocarbon. Among them, the PAN-based carbon fibers are preferred in terms of excellent balance between strength and elastic modulus. To provide conductivity, carbon fibers coated with metal such as nickel, copper, or ytterbium can also be used. The carbon fibers (A) preferably have a surface oxygen concentration ratio [O/C] of 0.05 to 0.5. The surface oxygen concentration ratio [O/C] is an atomic ratio of oxygen (O) to carbon (C) on the fiber surface measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A surface oxygen concentration ratio of 0.05 or more can ensure a sufficient amount of functional group on the carbon fiber surface, providing stronger adhesion, which further improves mechanical properties, particularly, flexural strength and tensile strength. The surface oxygen concentration ratio is more preferably 0.08 or more, still more preferably 0.1 or more. The upper limit of the surface oxygen concentration ratio is not limited to a particular value, but in terms of balance between handleability and productivity of the carbon fibers, it is typically preferably up to 0.5, more preferably up to 0.4, and still more preferably up to 0.3. The surface oxygen concentration ratio of the carbon fibers is determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy according to the following procedure. First, a carbon fiber filament from which a sizing agent and the like deposited on the carbon fiber surface have been removed with a solvent is cut into 20-mm lengths, and spread on a sample support made of copper. Thereafter, using AlKal, 2 as an X-ray source, the inside of a sample chamber is kept at 1×10−8 Ton. As a correction value of a peak associated with electrification during the measurement, the kinetic energy value (K.E.) of the main peak of C is is set at 1,202 eV. The C is peak area is determined by drawing a straight baseline in the K.E. range of 1,191 to 1,205 eV. The 0 is peak area is determined by drawing a straight baseline in the K.E. range of 947 to 959 eV. The surface oxygen concentration ratio is calculated as a ratio of the number of atoms from the ratio of the O 1s peak area to the C 1s peak area using an apparatus-specific sensitivity correction value. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy apparatus model ES-200 manufactured by Kokusai Denki Co., Ltd. is used, and the sensitivity correction value is set at 1.74. Examples of the method of controlling the surface oxygen concentration ratio [O/C] at 0.05 to 0.5 include, but are not limited to, electrolytic oxidation, chemical oxidation, and gas phase oxidation, among which electrolytic oxidation is preferred. The average fiber diameter of the carbon fibers (A), though not critical, is preferably 1 to 20 μm, more preferably 3 to 15 μm from the standpoint of mechanical properties and surface appearance of the molded article. The number of single fibers in a reinforcement fiber filament, though not critical, is preferably 100 to 350,000, and more preferably 20,000 to 100,000 from the standpoint of productivity. To improve the adhesion between the carbon fibers (A) and the thermoplastic resin (C) (matrix resin), the carbon fibers (A) are preferably subjected to surface treatment. Examples of the surface treatment include electrolytic treatment, ozonation, and UV treatment. To prevent fluffing of the carbon fibers (A) or improve the adhesion between the carbon fibers (A) and the thermoplastic resin (C) (matrix resin), it is also preferable to provide the carbon fibers with a sizing agent. Specific examples of sizing agents include epoxy resins, phenolic resins, polyethylene glycol, polyurethanes, polyesters, emulsifiers, and surfactants. These may be used in combination of two or more. These sizing agents would be contained on the surface of the carbon fibers (A) in the molding material. The sizing agent is preferably water-soluble or water-dispersible, and epoxy resins which have high wettability with the carbon fibers (A) are preferred. In particular, polyfunctional epoxy resins are more preferred. Examples of polyfunctional epoxy resins include bisphenol A epoxy resins, bisphenol F epoxy resins, aliphatic epoxy resins, and phenol novolac epoxy resins. Among them, aliphatic epoxy resins, which readily exhibit adhesion to a matrix resin, are preferred. Aliphatic epoxy resins, due to their flexible backbones, tend to have a structure with high toughness even at a high crosslink density. The presence of an aliphatic epoxy resin between the carbon fibers and the matrix resin provides flexibility and low detachability, which can further improve the strength of the molded article. Examples of polyfunctional aliphatic epoxy resins include diglycidyl ether compounds such as ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ethers, propylene glycol diglycidyl ether, polypropylene glycol diglycidyl ethers, 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether, neopentyl glycol diglycidyl ether, polytetramethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, and polyalkylene glycol diglycidyl ethers; and polyglycidyl ether compounds such as glycerol polyglycidyl ether, diglycerol polyglycidyl ether, polyglycerol polyglycidyl ethers, sorbitol polyglycidyl ethers, arabitol polyglycidyl ethers, trimethylolpropane polyglycidyl ethers, trimethylolpropane glycidyl ethers, pentaerythritol polyglycidyl ethers, and polyglycidyl ethers of aliphatic polyhydric alcohols. Among the aliphatic epoxy resins above, aliphatic polyglycidyl ether compounds having a large number of highly reactive glycidyl groups are more preferred. The aliphatic polyglycidyl ether compounds have a good balance among flexibility, crosslink density, and compatibility with a matrix resin, and can further improve the adhesion. In particular, glycerol polyglycidyl ether, diglycerol polyglycidyl ether, polyethylene glycol glycidyl ethers, and polypropylene glycol glycidyl ethers are still more preferred. The amount of sizing agent deposited is preferably 0.01 parts by weight to 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the carbon fibers (A). When the amount of the sizing agent deposited is 0.01 parts by weight or more, the adhesion to the thermoplastic resin (C) further improves. It is more preferably 0.05 parts by weight or more, still more preferably 0.1 parts by weight or more. When the amount of the sizing agent deposited is 10 parts by weight or less, the physical properties of the thermoplastic resin (C) can be maintained at a higher level. It is more preferably 5 parts by weight or less, still more preferably 2 parts by weight or less. Examples of the method of providing a sizing agent include, but are not limited to, immersing the carbon fibers in a sizing solution via a roller, contacting the carbon fibers with a roller to which a sizing solution is attached, and spraying a sizing solution on the carbon fibers in the form of a mist. A batch method or a continuous method may be used, but the continuous method, which can achieve high productivity and small variation, is preferred. In such a case, it is preferable to control conditions such as sizing solution concentration, temperature, and yarn tension so that active ingredients in the sizing agent can be deposited on the carbon fibers (A) uniformly in an amount in an appropriate range. Furthermore, it is more preferable to excite the carbon fibers (A) with ultrasonic waves when providing a sizing agent. The drying temperature and drying time should be adjusted according to the amount of compound to be deposited, and to shorten the time required for completely removing the solvent used to provide a sizing agent and drying, and at the same time, prevent thermal degradation of the sizing agent to thereby prevent solidification of the sized carbon fibers (A) which may lead to deteriorated spreadability, the drying temperature is preferably 150° C. to 350° C., more preferably 180° C. to 250° C. Examples of solvents used to dilute the sizing agent include water, methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, and acetone, and water is preferred from the standpoint of ease of handling and disaster prevention. Thus, when a compound insoluble or poorly soluble in water is used as a sizing agent, it is preferable to add an emulsifier and a surfactant to disperse the compound in water. Specific examples of emulsifiers and surfactants that can be used include anionic emulsifiers such as styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer, olefin-maleic anhydride copolymer, naphthalene sulfonic acid formalin condensate, and sodium polyacrylate; cationic emulsifiers such as polyethyleneimine and polyvinyl imidazoline; and nonionic emulsifiers such as nonylphenol ethylene oxide adducts, polyvinyl alcohol, polyoxyethylene ether ester copolymer, and sorbitan ester ethyl oxide adducts, and the nonionic emulsifiers, which cause little interaction, are preferred because they are less likely to inhibit the adhesive effect of a polyfunctional compound. In the molded article, the carbon fibers (A) have an average fiber length (LA) of 0.3 to 1.5 mm. Furthermore, the average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (DA) of the carbon fibers (A) and the average fiber length (LA) satisfy relationship [1]: [in-line-formulae]0.9×LA≦DA≦LA [1].[/in-line-formulae] If the average fiber length (LA) of the carbon fibers (A) is less than 0.3 mm, the reinforcing effect of the carbon fibers (A) in the molded article may not be sufficiently exerted, causing a reduction in mechanical properties, particularly, flexural strength and tensile strength. LA is preferably 0.7 mm or more. On the other hand, an average fiber length (LA) of more than 1.5 mm increases the entanglement between single fibers of the carbon fibers (A), leading to ununiform dispersion in the molded article, which results in a reduction in the above mechanical properties. LA is preferably 1.2 mm or less. Furthermore, when the average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (DA) does not satisfy relationship [1], the rigid carbon fibers (A) are present in the curved form until immediately before breakage in the molded article, which results in a reduction in mechanical properties, particularly, flexural strength, tensile strength, and impact strength. “Average fiber length” and “average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber” herein are not simple number averages calculated by applying the method of calculating a weight average molecular weight to calculation of fiber lengths and straight-line distances between two edges of a single fiber, but refer to an average fiber length and an average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber calculated by the following equations that take into account the contribution of fiber lengths and straight-line distances between two edges of a single fiber. Note that the following equations are applicable when the fiber diameters and density of the carbon fibers (A) are uniform: [in-line-formulae]Average fiber length=Σ(Mi2×Ni)/Σ(Mi×Ni)[/in-line-formulae]Mi: fiber length (mm)Ni: number of carbon fibers having a fiber length Mi [in-line-formulae]Average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber=Σ(Mi′2×Ni′)/Σ(Mi′×Ni′)[/in-line-formulae]Mi′: straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (mm)Ni′: number of carbon fibers having a straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber Mi′. The average fiber length and the average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber can be measured by the following method. A molded article sandwiched between glass plates is heated on a hot stage set at 300° C. and uniformly dispersed in the form of a film. The film in which carbon fibers are uniformly dispersed is observed under a light microscope (50 to 200×). The fiber lengths and straight-line distances between two edges of a single fiber of randomly-selected 1,000 carbon fibers (A) are measured, and an average fiber length (LA) and an average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (DA) are calculated by the above equations. The molded article contains the organic fibers (B) in addition to the carbon fibers (A) described above. Inorganic fibers such as the carbon fibers (A), which are rigid and brittle, are less prone to entanglement and prone to breakage. Thus, a fiber bundle composed of inorganic fibers alone has drawbacks in that it readily breaks during production of a molded article and readily falls off the molded article. Inclusion of the organic fibers (B), which are flexible, less likely to break, and likely to be present in the curved form in the molded article, can significantly improve the impact strength and low-temperature impact strength of the molded article. The amount of the organic fibers (B) in the molding material is 1 to 45 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the carbon fibers (A), the organic fibers (B), and the thermoplastic resin (C). If the amount of the organic fibers (B) is less than 1 part by weight, the mechanical properties, particularly, impact properties and low-temperature impact properties of the molded article will be reduced. The amount of the organic fibers (B) is preferably 5 parts by weight or more. On the other hand, if the amount of the organic fibers (B) is more than 45 parts by weight, the entanglement between fibers will increase, leading to low dispersibility of the organic fibers (B) in the molded article, which often causes a reduction in impact strength of the molded article. The amount of the organic fibers (B) is preferably 30 parts by weight or less. The single fiber fineness of the organic fibers (B) is preferably 0.1 to 10 dtex, more preferably 0.5 to 5 dtex. Furthermore, to adjust the average fiber length and the average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber of the organic fibers such that relationship [2] described below are satisfied to thereby further improve impact properties and low-temperature impact properties, the tensile break elongation of the organic fibers (B) is preferably 10% or more, more preferably 20% or more. To improve fiber strength and rigidity of the molded article, the tensile break elongation of the organic fibers (B) is preferably 50% or less, more preferably 40% or less. The tensile break elongation (%) of the organic fibers (B) can be measured by the following method. A tensile test is carried out in a room under standard conditions (20° C., 65% RH) at a chuck distance of 250 mm and a tensile speed of 300 mm/min, and a length at fiber break is measured (breakages in the vicinity of chucks are considered as a chucking breakage and excluded from a data), calculated to the second decimal place by the following equation, and rounded to one decimal place. The average value of three data is defined as the tensile break elongation. [in-line-formulae]Tensile break elongation(%)=[(length at break(mm)−250)/250]×100[/in-line-formulae] The organic fibers (B) can be selected as appropriate without significantly reducing the mechanical properties of the molded article. Examples thereof include fibers obtained by spinning polyolefin resins such as polyethylene and polypropylene; polyamide resins such as nylon 6, nylon 66, and aromatic polyamide; polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate; and resins such as polyether ketone, polyether sulfone, polyarylene sulfide, and liquid crystal polyester. These may be used in combination of two or more. It is preferable to appropriately select from these organic fibers (B) according to the combination with the thermoplastic resin (C) (matrix resin). In particular, the melting temperature of the organic fibers (B) is preferably higher than the molding temperature (melting temperature) of the thermoplastic resin (C) by 30° C. to 150° C., more preferably by 50° C. to 100° C. Alternatively, organic fibers (B) obtained using a resin incompatible with the thermoplastic resin (C) are preferred because they are present in the molded article while maintaining its fibrous state and therefore can further improve the impact strength and low-temperature impact strength of the molded article. Examples of the organic fibers (B) having a high melting temperature include polyamide fibers, polyester fibers, polyphenylene sulfide fibers, and fluororesin fibers, and it is preferable to use at least one fiber selected from the group consisting of these fibers as the organic fibers (B). In the molded article, the organic fibers (B) have an average fiber length (LB) of 1.5 mm to 4 mm. Furthermore, the average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (DB) of the organic fibers (B) and the average fiber length (LB) satisfy relationship [2]: [in-line-formulae]0.1×LB≦DB≦0.9×LB [2].[/in-line-formulae] If the average fiber length (LB) of the organic fibers (B) is less than 1.5 mm, the reinforcing effect of the organic fibers (B) in the molded article may not be sufficiently exerted, reducing mechanical properties, particularly, impact strength. LB is preferably 1.9 mm or more. On the other hand, an average fiber length (LB) of more than 4 mm increases the entanglement between single fibers of the organic fibers (B), leading to ununiform dispersion in the molded article, which results in a reduction in the above mechanical properties. LB is preferably 3 mm or less. Furthermore, when the average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (DB) does not satisfy the above relationship [2], the organic fibers (B) are present not curved but more linearly in the molded article, leading to a reduced fiber reinforcing effect at break of the molded article, which results in a reduction in mechanical properties, particularly, impact strength, falling weight impact strength, and low-temperature falling weight impact strength. Similarly to the carbon fibers (A), “average fiber length” and “average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber” of the organic fibers (B) herein are not simple number averages calculated by applying the method of calculating a weight average molecular weight to calculation of fiber lengths and straight-line distances between two edges of a single fiber, but refer to an average fiber length and an average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber calculated by the following equations that take into account the contribution of fiber lengths and straight-line distances between two edges of a single fiber. Note that the following equations are applicable when the fiber diameters and density of the organic fibers (B) are uniform: [in-line-formulae]Average fiber length=Σ(Mi2×Ni)/Σ(Mi×Ni)[/in-line-formulae]Mi: fiber length (mm)Ni: number of organic fibers having a fiber length Mi [in-line-formulae]Average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber=Σ(Mi′2×Ni′)/Σ(Mi′×Ni′)[/in-line-formulae]Mi′: straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (mm)Ni′: number of organic fibers having a straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber Mi′. The average fiber length and the average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber can be measured by the following method. A molded article sandwiched between glass plates is heated on a hot stage set at 300° C. and uniformly dispersed in the form of a film. The film in which organic fibers are uniformly dispersed is observed under a light microscope (50 to 200×). The fiber lengths and straight-line distances between two edges of a single fiber of randomly-selected 1,000 organic fibers (B) are measured, and an average fiber length (LB) and an average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (DB) are calculated by the above equations. The average straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber (DB) of the organic fibers (B) in the molded article can be adjusted, for example, according to the type of the organic fibers (B) above and the conditions of molding.

The molecular weight of the polycarbonate resin, though not critical, is preferably 10,000 to 50,000 in terms of viscosity average molecular weight.

In such a case, the other polycarbonate resin(s) preferably has a viscosity average molecular weight of more than 50,000, preferably more than 80,000. Such a polycarbonate resin has a high entropy elasticity, is advantageous when molding such as gas-assisted molding is used, and exhibits properties derived from the high entropy elasticity (anti-drip properties, drawdown properties, and properties of improving melt properties such as jetting). The viscosity average molecular weight (M) of the polycarbonate resin was determined by substituting a specific viscosity (ηsp) of a solution of 0.7 g of the polycarbonate resin in 100 mL of methylene chloride, as measured at 20° C., into the following equation: [in-line-formulae]ηsp/c=[η]+0.45×[η]2c (where [η] is a limiting viscosity)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae][η]=1.23×10−4M0.83 [/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]c=0.7.[/in-line-formulae] The molded article may include a compound having a number average molecular weight of 200 to 50,000 in addition to the carbon fibers (A), the organic fibers (B), and the thermoplastic resin (C). The compound having a number average molecular weight of 200 to 50,000, at normal temperature, is typically a solid that is relatively brittle and easily broken or a liquid. Such a compound, due to its low molecular weight, is highly flowable, and can promote dispersion of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in the thermoplastic resin (C). In other words, a number average molecular weight of 200 or more can further improve the mechanical properties of the molded article, particularly, flexural strength and tensile strength. The number average molecular weight is more preferably 1,000 or more. A number average molecular weight of 50,000 or less, which means that the compound has an appropriately low viscosity, provides excellent impregnation into the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) contained in the molded article, and can further improve the dispersibility of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in the molded article. The number average molecular weight is more preferably 3,000 or less. The number average molecular weight of such a compound can be determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The melt viscosity at 200° C. of the compound having a number average molecular weight of 200 to 50,000 is preferably lower than the melt viscosity of the thermoplastic resin (C).

The compound (D) in an amount of 1 part by weight or more further improves the flowability of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in the molded article, leading to further improved dispersibility. The amount of the compound (D) is preferably 2 parts by weight or more, more than preferably 4 parts by weight or more. The compound (D) in an amount of 20 parts by weight or less can further improve the mechanical properties, particularly, flexural strength, tensile strength, and impact strength of the molded article. The amount of the compound (D) is preferably 15 parts by weight or less, more preferably 12 parts by weight or less, and still more preferably 10 parts by weight or less. During molding temperatures at a heating rate of 10° C./min (in air), the compound (D) preferably shows a weight loss on heating of up to 5% by weight, more preferably up to 3% by weight. A weight loss on heating of up to 5% by weight can reduce decomposition gas that may generate when the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) are impregnated with the compound (D), leading to reduced void formation after molding. The gas generation can be reduced particularly in high-temperature molding. The weight loss of the compound (D) during molding temperatures can be determined by measuring weights during molding temperatures by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a platinum sample pan in an air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10° C./min. The rate of change of melt viscosity of the compound (D) after heating at 200° C. for 2 hours is preferably 1.5 or less, more preferably 1.3 or less. A rate of change of melt viscosity after heating at 200° C. for 2 hours of 1.5 or less can achieve stable production and prevent uneven deposition. The rate of change of melt viscosity of the compound (D) can be determined by the following method. First, a melt viscosity at 200° C. is measured with a viscoelasticity meter at 0.5 Hz using a 40-mm parallel plate. The compound (D) is allowed to stand in a hot-air dryer at 200° C. for 2 hours, after which a melt viscosity at 200° C. is measured in a similar manner, and a rate of change of viscosity is calculated using the following equation: [in-line-formulae]Rate of change of melt viscosity=melt viscosity at 200° C. after heating at 200° C. for 2 hours/melt viscosity at 200° C. before heating at 200° C. for 2 hours.[/in-line-formulae] The epoxy resin suitably used as the compound (D) refers to a compound having two or more epoxy groups, wherein the compound includes substantially no curing agent and does not undergo curing due to what is called three-dimensional cross-linking even when heated. The compound (D) preferably has a glycidyl group, which facilitates interaction with the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B), compatibility with a fiber bundle (E), and impregnation. Furthermore, the dispersibility of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) during molding further improves. Examples of the compound having a glycidyl group include glycidyl ether epoxy resins, glycidyl ester epoxy resins, glycidyl amine epoxy resins, and alicyclic epoxy resins. These may be used in combination of two or more.

Above all, in terms of excellent balance between viscosity and heat resistance, glycidyl ether epoxy resins are preferred, and bisphenol A epoxy resins and bisphenol F epoxy resins are more preferred. The number average molecular weight of the epoxy resin is preferably 200 to 5,000. When the number average molecular weight of the epoxy resin is 200 or more, the mechanical properties of the molded article can br further improved. The number average molecular weight of the epoxy resin is more preferably 800 or more, still more preferably 1,000 or more. When the number average molecular weight of the epoxy resin is 5,000 or less, excellent impregnation into the fiber bundle (E) is provided, and the dispersibility of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) can be further improved. The number average molecular weight of the epoxy resin is more preferably 4,000 or less, still more preferably 3,000 or less. The number average molecular weight of the epoxy resin can be determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Examples of terpene resins include polymers and copolymers obtained by polymerization of terpene monomers optionally with aromatic monomers in an organic solvent in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst. Examples of terpene monomers include monocyclic monoterpenes such as α-pinene, β-pinene, dipentene, d-limonene, myrcene, allo-ocimene, ocimene, α-phellandrene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, 1,8-cineol, 1,4-cineol, α-terpineol, β-terpineol, γ-terpineol, sabinene, p-menthadienes, and carenes. Examples of aromatic monomers include styrene and α-methylstyrene. Among them, α-pinene, β-pinene, dipentene, and d-limonene, which have high compatibility with the thermoplastic resin (C), are preferred, and homopolymers of these terpene monomers are more preferred. Furthermore, hydrogenated terpene resins obtained by hydrogenation of these terpene resins, which have even higher compatibility with the thermoplastic resin (C), particularly, a polypropylene resin, are preferred. The glass transition temperature of the terpene resin, though not critical, is preferably 30 to 100° C. A glass transition temperature of 30° C. or higher makes it easy to handle the compound (D) during molding. A glass transition temperature of 100° C. or lower makes it possible to moderately control the compound (D) during molding, leading to improved moldability. The number average molecular weight of the terpene resin is preferably 200 to 5,000. A number average molecular weight of 200 or more can further improve the mechanical properties, particularly, flexural strength and tensile strength of the molded article. A number average molecular weight of 5,000 or less, which means that the terpene resin has an appropriately low viscosity, provides excellent impregnation, and can further improve the dispersibility of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in the molded article. The number average molecular weight of the terpene resin can be determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC).

A method of producing the molding material and a method of producing the molded article will now be described. The molding material can be obtained, for example, by the following method. First, a roving of carbon fibers (A) and a roving of organic fibers (B) are doubled in parallel to the longer direction of fiber to prepare a fiber bundle (E) having the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B). The fiber bundle (E) is then impregnated with a molten compound (D) to prepare a composite (F). The composite (F) is guided to an impregnation die filled with a molten thermoplastic resin (C) to coat the outer surface of the composite (F) with the thermoplastic resin (C), and pultruded through a nozzle. The pultruded product is cooled and solidified, and then pelletized to a predetermined length to obtain a molding material. The thermoplastic resin (C) may be impregnated into the fiber bundle (E) as long as it is contained at the outer side of the composite (F). The molding material obtained can be molded to produce a molded article. A preferred molding method is molding using a die, and in particular, molding using an injection molding machine can continuously provide stable molded articles. The conditions of injection molding is not particularly restricted and, for example, preferred conditions are as follows: injection time: 0.5 seconds to 10 seconds, more preferably 2 seconds to 10 seconds; back pressure: 0.1 MPa to 10 MPa, more preferably 2 MPa to 8 MPa; holding pressure: 1 MPa to 50 MPa, more preferably 1 MPa to 30 MPa; pressure holding time: 1 second to 20 seconds, more preferably 5 seconds to 20 seconds; cylinder temperature: 200° C. to 320° C., mold temperature: 20° C. to 100° C. The cylinder temperature refers to a temperature of a portion for heating and melting a molding material in the injection molding machine, and the mold temperature refers to a temperature of a die into which a resin is injected for a desired shape. By appropriately selecting these conditions, particularly, injection time, back pressure, and mold temperature, the length of reinforcement fibers and the straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber in the molded article can be readily adjusted to satisfy relationships [1] and [2]. The fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material (also referred to as “molding material”) that is suitable to produce the molded article will now be described. (1) A fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material (hereinafter also referred to as “molding material according to a first configuration”) and (2) a molding material (hereinafter also referred to as “molding material according to a second configuration”) can be suitably used as a molding material to produce the molded article. The molding material according to a first configuration comprises 5 to 45 parts by weight of carbon fibers (A), 1 to 45 parts by weight of organic fibers (B), 20 to 93 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin (C), and 1 to 20 parts by weight of a compound (D) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (C) based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the carbon fibers (A), the organic fibers (B), the thermoplastic resin (C), and the compound (D) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (C), wherein the thermoplastic resin (C) is contained at the outer side of a composite (F) obtained by impregnating a fiber bundle (E) comprising the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) with the compound (D); the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) are unevenly distributed in a cross section of the fiber bundle (E); and the length of the fiber bundle (E) and the length of the fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material are substantially the same. The molding material according to a second configuration comprises a carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material (X) comprising 5 to 45 parts by weight of carbon fibers (A), 94 to 35 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin (C), and 1 to 20 parts by weight of a compound (D) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (C) based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the carbon fibers (A), the thermoplastic resin (C), and the compound (D) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (C), wherein the thermoplastic resin (C) is contained at the outer side of a composite (F) obtained by impregnating the carbon fibers (A) with the compound (D), and the length of the carbon fibers (A) and the length of the carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material are substantially the same; and an organic fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin molding material (Y) comprising 1 to 45 parts by weight of organic fibers (B), 94 to 35 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin (G), and 1 to 20 parts by weight of a compound (H) based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the organic fibers (B), the thermoplastic resin (G), and the compound (H) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (G). First, the molding material according to the first configuration will be described. The molding material according to the first configuration used to produce the molded article described above comprises at least carbon fibers (A), organic fibers (B), a thermoplastic resin (C), and a compound (D) having a melt viscosity at 200° C. that is lower than that of the thermoplastic resin (C) (also referred to as “compound (D)”). Furthermore, the molding material according to the first configuration has a structure comprising a composite (F) obtained by impregnating a fiber bundle (E) comprising the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) with the compound (D), the thermoplastic resin (C) being contained at the outer side of the composite (F). Compared to a fiber bundle composed of the carbon fibers (A) alone, which are rigid, brittle, less prone to entanglement, and prone to breakage, the fiber bundle (E) comprising the organic fibers (B) can serve as a reinforcement material to provide the molded article with higher impact strength and higher low-temperature impact strength. The thermoplastic resin (C) firmly holds the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in the molded article. These effects were as described above with respect to the molded article. The compound (D) forms a composite together with the fiber bundle (E), and assists a matrix resin (the thermoplastic resin (C)) to impregnate into the fiber bundle (E) during molding and assist the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) to disperse in the matrix resin (the thermoplastic resin (C)), i.e., acts as what is called an impregnation aid and a dispersion aid. The molding material according to the first configuration has the composite (F) including the thermoplastic resin (C) in which gaps between single fibers of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in the form of a continuous fiber bundle are filled with the compound (D). The composite (F) has a structure in which the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) are dispersed like islands in a sea of the compound (D). The molding material according to the first configuration comprises the thermoplastic resin (C) at the outer side of the composite (F) obtained by impregnating the fiber bundle (E) with the compound (D). A structure is preferred in which the thermoplastic resin (C) is disposed surrounding the composite (F) in a cross-section perpendicular to the longer direction of the molding material, or the composite (F) and the thermoplastic resin (C) are disposed in layers, the thermoplastic resin (C) being the outermost layer. In the molding material according to the first configuration, the compound (D) in most cases is of low molecular weight, and at normal temperature, it is typically a solid that is relatively brittle and easily broken or a liquid. Through the structure in which the thermoplastic resin (C) is contained at the outer side of the composite (F), the thermoplastic resin (C) having a high molecular weight protects the composite (F), preventing destruction and scattering of the compound (D) due to the impact or abrasion during conveyance and handling of the molding material, and the shape of the molding material can be retained. The molding material, from the standpoint of handleability, preferably keeps the above-described shape until being subjected to molding. The composite (F) and the thermoplastic resin (C) may be such that the composite (F) and the thermoplastic resin (C) which has partially penetrated into a portion of the composite (F) at or near their interface are mixing with each other, or that the fiber bundle (E) is impregnated with the thermoplastic resin (C). In the molding material according to the first configuration, the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) are preferably unevenly distributed in a cross section of the fiber bundle (E). The cross-section of the fiber bundle (E) refers to a cross-section of the fiber bundle (E) perpendicular to the longer direction of fiber. Uneven distribution of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in a cross section of the fiber bundle (E) can prevent entanglement between the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) during molding to provide a molded article in which the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) are uniformly dispersed. Consequently, the mechanical properties, particularly, impact strength and low-temperature impact strength of the molded article can be significantly improved. “Uneven distribution” herein means that in a cross section of the fiber bundle (E), the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) are not present uniformly throughout the region but present unevenly at some parts. Examples of “uneven distribution” include what is called “core-in-sheath” structures such as an example where the carbon fibers (A) envelop the organic fibers (B) in a cross section of the fiber bundle (E), as shown in FIG. 3, and an example where the organic fibers (B) envelop the carbon fibers (A), as shown in FIG. 4, and a structure in which a bundle of the carbon fibers (A) and a bundle of the organic fibers (B) are present separated by a certain boundary in a cross section of the fiber bundle (E), as shown in FIG. 5. “Envelop” herein refers to a state in which the carbon fibers (A) are disposed at the core and the organic fibers (B) at the sheath, or a state in which the organic fibers (B) are disposed at the core and the carbon fibers (A) at the sheath. In the example shown in FIG. 5, at least a portion of the carbon fibers (A) and at least a portion of the organic fibers (B) are both in contact with the thermoplastic resin (C) at the outer side in a cross section of the fiber bundle (E). In this case, examples where the carbon fibers (A) or the organic fibers (B) are in contact with the thermoplastic resin (C) includes examples where the carbon fibers (A) or the organic fibers (B) are in contact with the thermoplastic resin (C) via the compound (D). To confirm that the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) are unevenly distributed in a cross section of the fiber bundle (E), for example, a method can be used in which a cross-section perpendicular to the longer direction of fiber of the molding material is observed under a light microscope at a magnification of 300×, and the micrograph obtained is subjected to image processing and analyzed. In the molding material according to the first configuration, the length of the fiber bundle (E) is preferably substantially the same as the length of the molding material. When the length of the fiber bundle (E) is substantially the same as the length of the molding material, the lengths of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in the molded article can be long, which can provide more excellent mechanical properties. The length of the molding material is a length of the orientation direction of the fiber bundle (E) in the molding material. “Substantially the same length” means that the fiber bundle (E) is not cut intentionally in the molding material or the fiber bundle (E) significantly shorter than the overall length of the molding material is substantially absent. Although the amount of the fiber bundle (E) shorter than the overall length of the molding material is not limited to a particular value, the amount of the fiber bundle (E) having a length that is 50% or less of the overall length of the molding material is preferably 30% by mass or less of the total amount of the fiber bundle (E), more preferably 20% by mass or less. The molding material is preferably continuous and has a cross-sectional shape that is substantially the same across the length.

This effect was as described above with respect to the molded article. The thermoplastic resin (C) and the thermoplastic resin (G), which are matrix resins having relatively high viscosity and excellent physical properties such as toughness, are impregnated into the carbon fibers (A) or the organic fibers (B) during molding to firmly hold the carbon fibers (A) or the organic fibers (B) in the molded article.

Example 1 Using equipment for producing long-fiber reinforced resin pellets, the equipment including a coating die for wire coating mounted at the end of a TEX-30α model twin-screw extruder (screw diameter: 30 mm, L/D=32) manufactured by Japan Steel Works, LTD., the extruder cylinder temperature was set at 220° C., and the thermoplastic resin (C) shown in Table 2 was supplied from a main hopper and melt-kneaded at a screw speed of 200 rpm. While adjusting the discharge rate to be 8 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of (A) to (C), the compound (D) melted by heating at 200° C. was fed to a die port (3 mm in diameter), from which the molten thermoplastic resin (C) is discharged, to be disposed continuously surrounding a fiber bundle (E) composed of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B).

The evaluation results are summarized in Table 8. Comparative Example 12 A molding material was prepared and evaluated in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the long-fiber pellets (X-1) obtained in Production Example 1, the long-fiber pellets (Y-3) obtained in Production Example 5, and pellets of the thermoplastic resin (C) shown in Table 5 were dry blended such that, the amounts of (X-1), (Y-3), and (C) were 10 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, and 70 parts by weight, respectively, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of (X-1), (Y-3), and (C). The evaluation results are summarized in Table 8. The materials of Examples 1 to 12, in the molded articles of which the organic fibers (B) were present in the curved form, all exhibited high impact strength (Charpy impact strength, falling weight impact strength) and high low-temperature impact strength (low-temperature falling weight impact strength). As can be seen from Examples 11 to 12, a similar effect was produced even when organic fibers of different type were used as the organic fibers (B). Furthermore, as can be seen from Example 13, a similar effect was produced without the compound (D). Also, the materials of Examples 14 to 18 were all excellent in dispersibility of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B), and exhibited high impact strength (Charpy impact strength, falling weight impact strength) and high low-temperature impact strength (low-temperature falling weight impact strength). As can be seen from the molding materials of Examples 17 to 18, even when the disposition of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in the fiber bundle (E) was changed, the dispersibility of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) was excellent, and high impact strength and high low-temperature impact strength were exhibited similarly to Examples 14 to 16. Also, the materials of Examples 19 to 24 were all excellent in dispersibility of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B), and exhibited high impact strength (Charpy impact strength, falling weight impact strength) and high low-temperature impact strength (low-temperature falling weight impact strength). As can be seen from Example 24, when the organic fiber reinforced molding material (Y) was produced by melt-kneading, the dispersibility of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) was excellent, and high impact strength and high low-temperature impact strength were exhibited similarly to Examples 19 to 23, leading to even higher productivity. On the other hand, in Comparative Example 1, the absence of the organic fibers (B) resulted in a small fiber reinforcing effect, leading to low impact strength and low low-temperature impact strength. In Comparative Example 2, the decreased amount of the carbon fibers (A) resulted in low impact strength and low flexural strength. In Comparative Example 3, the increased amount of the carbon fibers (A) caused ununiform dispersion in the molded article, resulting in low impact strength. In Comparative Example 4, the increased amount of the organic fibers (B) caused increased entanglement between the organic fibers (B), ununiform dispersion in the molded article, and fiber breakage due to increased contact between the fibers, resulting in low impact strength. In Comparative Examples 5 to 6, the short average fiber length of the carbon fibers (A) or the organic fibers (B) resulted in a small fiber reinforcing effect, leading to low impact strength and low low-temperature impact strength. In Comparative Example 7, since the straight-line distance between two edges of a single fiber of the organic fibers (B) was long, and the organic fibers (B) were present linearly, the fiber reinforcing effect at break of the molded article was small, leading to low impact strength and low low-temperature impact strength. In Comparative Example 8, the decreased amount of the carbon fibers (A) resulted in low impact strength and low flexural strength. In Comparative Example 9, the increased amount of the organic fibers (B) increased the entanglement between the organic fibers (B) and hindered uniform dispersion in the molded article, resulting in low impact strength. In Comparative Example 10, a uniformly mixed disposition of the carbon fibers (A) and the organic fibers (B) in an internal cross-section of the fiber bundle (E) of the molding material caused increased entanglement between fibers in the fiber bundle (E), a short average fiber length of the carbon fibers (A), and ununiform dispersion in the molded article, leading to low impact strength and low low-temperature impact strength. In Comparative Example 11, the absence of the organic fibers (B) resulted in a small fiber reinforcing effect, leading to low impact strength and low low-temperature impact strength. In Comparative Example 12, the decreased amount of the carbon fibers (A) in the carbon fiber reinforced molding material (X) resulted in low impact strength and low flexural strength.
