Step 4
The compound 41 (127 mg, 0.272 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (0.5 mL). Tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride (1 mol/L tetrahydrofuran solution, 408 ÂµL, 0.408 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 days. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography (chloroform-methanol) to give the compound 42 (77 mg, yield 77.2%).
