(3aR,5S,11bR)-5-(3-Azidopropyl)-7-methoxy-3,3a,5,11b-tetrahydro-2H-benzo[g]furo[3,2-c]isochromene-2,6,11-trione (6)
To a solution of (3aR,5S,11bR)-5-(3-azidopropyl)-6, 7,11-trimethoxy-3,3a,5,11b-tetrahydro-2H-benzo[g]furo[3,2-c]isochromen-2-one (reported intermediate 6 h1) (41 mg, 0.1 mmol) in a mixture of water (0.5 mL) and acetonitrile (1 mL) at 0° C., a solution of cerium ammonium nitrate (126 mg, 0.2 mmol) in H2O (0.5 mL) was added in dropwise fashion with stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min before the addition of water (5 mL). The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (10 mL×2) and the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel using hexane/EtOAc (1/1) to afford 6 as a yellow solid (31 mg, 80% yield).
