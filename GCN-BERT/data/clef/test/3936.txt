FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to macrocyclic compounds that modulate the activity of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds and methods of treating proliferative disorders and disorders of dysregulated apoptosis, such as cancer, utilizing the compounds of the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a genetically and biochemically regulated mechanism that plays an important role in development and homeostasis in invertebrates as well as vertebrates. Aberrancies in apoptosis that lead to premature cell death have been linked to a variety of developmental disorders. Deficiencies in apoptosis that result in the lack of cell death have been linked to cancer and chronic viral infections. Caspases are cysteine-containing aspartate specific proteases that play a key role in effecting apoptosis. Once activated from their inactive zymogen form by proteolytic processing, caspases digest vital cell proteins from within the cell. Since caspases are such strong proteases, tight control of this family of proteins is necessary to prevent premature cell death. In addition to proteolytic processing, caspases are also regulated by a family of molecules known as Inhibitors of Apoptosis Proteins (IAP). IAPs are naturally occurring intra-cellular proteins that suppress caspase-dependent apoptosis. SMAC, an intracellular protein also known as DIABLO, functions to modulate the activity of IAPs. In normal healthy cells, SMAC and IAPs function together to maintain healthy cells. However, in certain disease states, e.g., cancers and other proliferative disorders, the activities of IAPs are not adequately modulated and therefore, prevent apoptosis and cause or exacerbate abnormal proliferation and survival. IAP antagonists, also known as SMAC mimetics, are synthetic molecules that mimic the structure and IAP modulating activity of the four N-terminal amino acids of SMAC (AVPI). When administered to a subject suffering proliferative disorders, the compounds antagonize IAP activities causing an increase in apoptosis among abnormally proliferating cells. IAPs are found in all organisms ranging from Drosophila to human and are known to be overexpressed in many human cancers. IAPs comprise one to three Baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains. The BIR domain is a zinc binding domain of about 70 residues comprising 4 alpha-helices and 3 beta strands, with cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate the zinc ion. The BIR 2 and 3 domains contain a conserved inhibitor of apoptosis binding motif (IBM) capable of binding caspases—and inhibiting their proteolytic activity. As an example, human X-chromosome linked IAP (XIAP) inhibits the executioner caspases-3, and -7 as well as the Apaf-1-cytochrome C mediated activation of the initiator caspase-9. Caspases-3 and -7 are inhibited by the BIR2 domain of XIAP, while the BIR3 domain of XIAP is responsible for the inhibition of caspase-9 activation. XIAP is expressed ubiquitously in most adult and fetal tissues. Overexpression of XIAP in tumor cells has been demonstrated to confer protection of the tumor cells against a variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli and promotes resistance to chemotherapy. Consistent with this, a strong correlation between XIAP protein levels and survival has been demonstrated for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Other BIR2-3 containing IAP family members, while capable of binding caspases, do not directly inhibit their proteolytic activity. Rather they inhibit apoptosis by affecting signaling activities of key proteins in cell survival pathways. Like XIAP, these IAPs possess a carboxyl-terminal RING finger domain capable of conjugating ubiquitin to specific protein substrates. As an example, cellular IAPs 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2), ubiquitinate RIPK, a signaling intermediate of tumor necrosis death receptor (TNF-DR) activation. Ubiquitinated RIPK is unable to activate caspase-8 in the context of DR activation by TNF family DR ligands. On the contrary, the long ubiquitin chains attached to RIPK provide a scaffold by which cell components of the NFkB cell survival signaling cascade can attach and become activated. In normal cells undergoing apoptosis, the IAP-mediated inhibition is removed by the mitochondrial protein SMAC (second mitochondrial activator of caspases; also known as DIABLO). SMAC is synthesized as a precursor molecule of 239 amino acids; the N-terminal 55 residues serving as the mitochondria targeting sequence that is removed after import. The mature form of SMAC resides in the inter-membrane space of mitochondria. At the time of apoptosis induction, SMAC is released from mitochondria into the cytosol where, together with cytochrome c, it binds to XIAP, and eliminates its' inhibitory effect on caspases. SMAC also binds cIAP1/2 and inhibits their ability to ubiquitinate RIPK. SMAC interacts with essentially all IAPs that have been examined to date and thus appears to be a master regulator of apoptosis in mammals. Down-regulation of XIAP expression by antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to sensitize tumor cells to death induced by a wide range of pro-apoptotic agents, both in vitro and in vivo. SMAC/DIABLO-derived peptides have also been demonstrated to sensitize a number of different tumor induced select cell lines to undergo apoptosis as single agents, while other cell lines require an additional stimulus such as DR agonists or co-treatment with pro-apoptotic drugs. Because IAP inhibition appears to be a viable mechanism for promoting apoptosis and treating diseases and conditions that are sensitive to apoptosis, there is a continuing need to develop compounds that can inhibit IAP.

These include infections (e.g. skin infections, GI infection, urinary tract infections, genito-urinary infections, systemic infections), proliferative diseases (e.g., cancer), and autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus). The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to animals, preferably mammals (e.g., domesticated animals, cats, dogs, mice, rats), and more preferably humans. Any method of administration may be used to deliver the compound or pharmaceutical composition to the animal. In certain embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered orally. In other embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered parenterally. In one embodiment, the compounds of this invention can be used for the treatment of any cancer type that fails to undergo apoptosis in a patient. This includes, but is not limited to: solid tumors, including but not limited to carcinomas; sarcomas including Kaposi's sarcoma; erythroblastoma; glioblastoma; meningioma; astrocytoma; melanoma; and myoblastoma. Treatment or prevention of non-solid tumor cancers, such as leukemia, is also contemplated by this invention. Types of cancers that may be treated with the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, brain cancers, skin cancers, bladder cancers, ovarian cancers, breast cancers, gastric cancers, pancreatic cancers, prostate cancers, colon cancers, blood cancers, lung cancers and bone cancers. Examples of such cancer types include neuroblastoma, intestine carcinoma such as rectum carcinoma, colon carcinoma, familiar adenomatous polyposis carcinoma and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, esophageal carcinoma, labial carcinoma, larynx carcinoma, hypopharynx carcinoma, tong carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, renal carcinoma, kidney parenchymal carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, cervix carcinoma, uterine corpus carcinoma, endometrium carcinoma, chorion carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, testis carcinoma, breast carcinoma, urinary carcinoma, melanoma, brain tumors such as glioblastoma, astrocytoma, meningioma, medulloblastoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), hepatocellular carcinoma, gall bladder carcinoma, bronchial carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, multiple myeloma, basalioma, teratoma, retinoblastoma, choroid melanoma, seminoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, craniopharyngioma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, myosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and plasmocytoma. In addition to apoptosis defects found in tumors, defects in the ability to eliminate self-reactive cells of the immune system due to apoptosis resistance are considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are characterized in that the cells of the immune system produce antibodies against its own organs and molecules or directly attack tissues resulting in the destruction of the latter. A failure of those self-reactive cells to undergo apoptosis leads to the manifestation of the disease. Defects in apoptosis regulation have been identified in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, according to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating an autoimmune disease by providing to a patient in need thereof a compound or composition of the present invention. Examples of such autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, collagen diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus. Sharp's syndrome, CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's syndrome, esophageal dysmotility, telangiectasia), dermatomyositis, vasculitis (Morbus Wegener's) and Sjogren's syndrome, renal diseases such as Goodpasture's syndrome, rapidly-progressing glomerulonephritis and membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis type II, endocrine diseases such as type-I diabetes, autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), autoimmune parathyroidism, pernicious anemia, gonad insufficiency, idiopathic Morbus Addison's, hyperthyreosis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and primary myxedema, skin diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, herpes gestationis, epidermolysis bullosa and erythema multiforme major, liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis type-1, autoimmune hepatitis type-2, primary sclerosing cholangitis, neuronal diseases such as multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, myasthenic Lambert-Eaton syndrome, acquired neuromyotomy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (Muller-Fischer syndrome), stiff-man syndrome, cerebellar degeneration, ataxia, opsoclonus, sensoric neuropathy and achalasia, blood diseases such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (Morbus Werlhof), infectious diseases with associated autoimmune reactions such as AIDS, Malaria and Chagas disease.

Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are co-administered with radiation therapy or a second therapeutic agent with cytostatic or antineoplastic activity. Suitable cytostatic chemotherapy compounds include, but are not limited to (i) antimetabolites; (ii) DNA-fragmenting agents, (iii) DNA-crosslinking agents, (iv) intercalating agents (v) protein synthesis inhibitors, (vi) topoisomerase I poisons, such as camptothecin or topotecan; (vii) topoisomerase II poisons, (viii) microtubule-directed agents, (ix) kinase inhibitors (x) miscellaneous investigational agents (xi) hormones and (xii) hormone antagonists. It is contemplated that compounds of the invention may be useful in combination with any known agents falling into the above 12 classes as well as any future agents that are currently in development. In particular, it is contemplated that compounds of the invention may be useful in combination with current Standards of Care as well as any that evolve over the foreseeable future. Specific dosages and dosing regimens would be based on physicians' evolving knowledge and the general skill in the art. The combination therapy is intended to embrace administration of these therapeutic agents in a sequential manner, that is, wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time, as well as administration of these therapeutic agents, or at least two of the therapeutic agents, in a substantially simultaneous manner. Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the subject a single dosage form having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple, single dosage forms for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection. Combination therapy also can embrace the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients and non-drug therapies (e.g., surgery or radiation treatment.) Where the combination therapy further comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and non-drug treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.

Formulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration.

Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain sugars, alcohols, antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the subject compounds may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsuled matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue. When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99% (more preferably, 10 to 30%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the rate and extent of absorption, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts. A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally, oral, intravenous, intracerebroventricular and subcutaneous doses of the compounds of this invention for a patient will range from about 0.01 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. If desired, the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. In certain aspects of the invention, dosing is one administration per day. While it is possible for a compound of the present invention to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the compound as a pharmaceutical formulation (composition). V. Definitions Throughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass all stereo and optical isomers and racemates thereof where such isomers exist. Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms are within the scope of the invention.

The present compounds can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Optically active forms may be prepared by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present invention. When enantiomeric or diastereomeric products are prepared, they may be separated by conventional methods, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Depending on the process conditions the end products of the present invention are obtained either in free (neutral) or salt form. Both the free form and the salts of these end products are within the scope of the invention. If so desired, one form of a compound may be converted into another form. A free base or acid may be converted into a salt; a salt may be converted into the free compound or another salt; a mixture of isomeric compounds of the present invention may be separated into the individual isomers. Compounds of the present invention, free form and salts thereof, may exist in multiple tautomeric forms, in which hydrogen atoms are transposed to other parts of the molecules and the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecules are consequently rearranged.

As used herein, the term “heterocyclo”, “heterocyclic” or “heterocyclyl” is intended to mean a 5, 6 or 7 membered non-aromatic ring system containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from O, N or S. Examples of heterocycles include, but are not limited to, pyrrolidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydropyranyl, piperidyl, pyrrolinyl, piperazinyl, imidazolinyl, morpholinyl, imidazolidinyl, pyrazolidinyl and pyrazolinyl. The term “counter ion” is used to represent a negatively charged species such as chloride, bromide, hydroxide, acetate, and sulfate or a positively charged species such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), ammonium (RnNHm+ where n=0-4 and m=0-4) and the like. The term “electron withdrawing group” (EWG) refers to a substituent which polarizes a bond, drawing electron density towards itself and away from other bonded atoms.

As used herein, the term “amine protecting group” means any group known in the art of organic synthesis for the protection of amine groups which is stable to an ester reducing agent, a disubstituted hydrazine, R4-M and R7-M, a nucleophile, a hydrazine reducing agent, an activator, a strong base, a hindered amine base and a cyclizing agent. Such amine protecting groups fitting these criteria include those listed in Wuts, P. G. M. and Greene, T. W. Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, Wiley (2007) and The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1981), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of amine protecting groups include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) acyl types such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl; (2) aromatic carbamate types such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, 1-(p-biphenyl)-1-methylethoxycarbonyl, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc); (3) aliphatic carbamate types such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl; (4) cyclic alkyl carbamate types such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl; (5) alkyl types such as triphenylmethyl and benzyl; (6) trialkylsilane such as trimethylsilane; (7) thiol containing types such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl; and (8) alkyl types such as triphenylmethyl, methyl, and benzyl; and substituted alkyl types such as 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, 2-phenylethyl, and t-butyl; and trialkylsilane types such as trimethylsilane. As referred to herein, the term “substituted” means that at least one hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen group, provided that normal valencies are maintained and that the substitution results in a stable compound. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C═C, C═N, or N═N). In cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms (e.g., amines) on compounds of the present invention, these may be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g., mCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of this invention. Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N→O) derivative. When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to three R groups, and at each occurrence R is selected independently from the definition of R. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom in which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and/or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 22nd Edition, Allen, L. V. Jr., Ed.; Pharmaceutical Press, London, UK (2012), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, compounds of formula I may have prodrug forms. Any compound that will be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e., a compound of formula I) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see: a) Design of Prodrugs, Bundgaard, H., ed., Elsevier (1985), and Methods in Enzymology, 112:309-396, Widder, K. et al., eds., Academic Press (1985);b) Bundgaard, H., Chapter 5, “Design and Application of Prodrugs,” A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, pp. 113-191, Krosgaard-Larsen, P. et al., eds., Harwood Academic Publishers (1991);c) Bundgaard, H., Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., 8:1-38 (1992);d) Bundgaard, H. et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 77:285 (1988);e) Kakeya, N. et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 32:692 (1984); andf) Rautio, J (Editor). Prodrugs and Targeted Delivery (Methods and Principles in Medicinal Chemistry), Vol 47, Wiley-VCH, 2011. Compounds containing a carboxy group can form physiologically hydrolyzable esters that serve as prodrugs by being hydrolyzed in the body to yield formula I compounds per se. Such prodrugs are preferably administered orally since hydrolysis in many instances occurs principally under the influence of the digestive enzymes. Parenteral administration may be used where the ester per se is active, or in those instances where hydrolysis occurs in the blood. Examples of physiologically hydrolyzable esters of compounds of formula I include C1-6alkyl, C1-6alkylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, indanyl, phthalyl, methoxymethyl, C1-6 alkanoyloxy-C1-6alkyl (e.g., acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or propionyloxymethyl), C1-6alkoxycarbonyloxy-C1-6alkyl (e.g., methoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl or ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl, (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)-methyl), and other well known physiologically hydrolyzable esters used, for example, in the penicillin and cephalosporin arts. Such esters may be prepared by conventional techniques known in the art. Preparation of prodrugs is well known in the art and described in, for example, King, F. D., ed., Medicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK (2nd edition, reproduced, 2006); Testa, B. et al., Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism. Chemistry, Biochemistry and Enzymology, VCHA and Wiley-VCH, Zurich, Switzerland (2003); Wermuth, C. G., ed., The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, 3rd edition, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (2008). The present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium and tritium. Isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. The term “solvate” means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The solvent molecules in the solvate may be present in a regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may comprise either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvates include, but are not limited to, hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, and isopropanolates. Methods of solvation are generally known in the art. As used herein, the term “patient” refers to organisms to be treated by the methods of the present invention. Such organisms preferably include, but are not limited to, mammals (e.g., murines, simians, equines, bovines, porcines, canines, felines, and the like), and most preferably includes humans. As used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” refers to the amount of a compound (e.g., a compound of the present invention) sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations, applications or dosages and is not intended to be limited to a particular formulation or administration route. As used herein, the term “treating” includes any effect, e.g., lessening, reducing, modulating, ameliorating or eliminating, that results in the improvement of the condition, disease, disorder, and the like, or ameliorating a symptom thereof. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutical composition” refers to the combination of an active agent with a carrier, inert or active, making the composition especially suitable for diagnostic or therapeutic use in vivo or ex vivo. Examples of bases include, but are not limited to, alkali metals (e.g., sodium) hydroxides, alkaline earth metals (e.g., magnesium), hydroxides, ammonia, and compounds of formula NW4+, wherein W is C1-4 alkyl, and the like. For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of the present invention are contemplated as being pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases that are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. VI. Methods of Preparation The macrocyclic compounds 10 can be prepared using the synthetic sequence depicted in Scheme 1. Reaction of a chlorinated resin 2 with commercially available (S)-2-((((9H-fluoren-9-yl)methoxy)carbonyl)amino)-3-(naphthalen-2-yl)propanoic acid (1) in the presence of a base, such as Hunig's base, provides resin-linked compound 3. Conversion of 3 to resin-linked peptide 4 can occur through standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis protocol (i.e., sequential removal of the Fmoc protecting group under basic conditions such as piperidine, followed by amide formation in the presence of a coupling reagent, such as HATU). Azide-alkyne cycloaddition (“click reaction”) of the resin-linked peptide 4 (containing an azide) with Fmoc protected alkyne 5 then provides the resin-linked triazole compound 6, which can be converted to the fully elaborated peptide 7 through Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis protocol. Resin-linked peptide 7 can undergo an azide-alkyne cycloaddition with Fmoc protected alkyne 8. Subsequent removal of the Fmoc group, cleavage from the resin and macrolactamization affords cyclic peptide intermediate 9. Base-promoted hydrolysis and Boc-deprotection of 9 provides the desired analog 10. The peptide coupling partner 24 can be prepared in solution as shown in Scheme 2. Readily available (2S,3S)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3-hydroxypyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (11) can be converted to acid 15 in five straightforward steps. Thus, t-butyl ester formation of 11 followed by mesylation of the requisite alcohol affords compound 12. Displacement of the methansulfonyl group of 12 with sodium azide affords intermediate 13, which can be treated with acid to afford azide 14. N-Boc-protection of 14 furnishes 15. Compound 15 can then undergo amide formation with 16 in the presence of, for example, EDC to give dipeptide 17. Removal of the Boc group of 17 and coupling of the requisite amine 18 with commercially available acid 19 (Chem-Impex) gives tripeptide 20. Removal of the Boc protecting group of 20 under acidic conditions and subsequent coupling of the resulting amine 21 with commercially available acid 22 (Chem-Impex) can provide compound 23. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester of 23 then affords the versatile coupling partner 24. Macrocyclic compounds 30 can be obtained from tetrapeptide 24 according to the route illustrated in Scheme 3. Treatment of 24 with the alkyne-substituted amino acid fragment 25 in the presence of CuSO4 provides triazole 26, which can undergo amide bond formation with 27 in the presence of HATU to give 28. The functionalized peptide 28 can be treated with CuSO4 in the presence of tetrapeptide 24 to provide the azide-alkyne cycloaddition product. Treatment of this intermediate with a solution of piperidine can afford the fully elaborated linear peptide 29. Macrocyclization of 29 in the presence of, for example, HATU followed by chemoselective hydrolysis of the allyl ester with Pd(PPh3)4 and phenylsilane can furnish the desired macrocycle 30. Macrocyclic bis-carboxylic acid compounds 31 can be prepared from key intermediate 30 via base-promoted hydrolysis with, for example, LiOH and subsequent Boc-deprotection in acidic media (Scheme 4). Alternatively, the mono-acid mono-ester 32 can be obtained by treatment of 30 with TFA. Analogs such as 35 can be prepared according to the synthetic sequence depicted in Scheme 5. Macrocycle 30 can be coupled to various amines, such as (3,5-difluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)methanamine to afford compounds such as 33. The phenol from the anisole fragment of 33 can be unmasked upon treatment with various reagents such as TMS-I. This reagent also facilitates N-Boc-deprotection leading to ester 34 along with the acid 35. Analogs such as 39 can be prepared according to the synthetic route illustrated in Scheme 6. Sequential treatment of macrocycle 30 with CDI and an appropriately substituted sulfonamide 36 in the presence of a base, such as DBU, can provide acylsulfonamide derivative 37. Base-promoted hydrolysis of methyl ester 37, followed by removal of the Boc group of the resulting intermediate 38 under acidic condition (e.g. TFA) can provide the desired macrocyclic derivative 39. Amide analogs such as 42 can be accessed using the synthetic sequence shown in Scheme 7. The coupling of amine 40 with macrocyclic acid 30 can be carried out in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent (e.g., HATU) to afford amide 41. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester of 41 followed by acetonide removal and Boc-deprotection with acid can provide the desired product 42. Analogs bearing heterocyclic acid isosteres can be prepared directly from carboxylic acid intermediate 30. As depicted in Scheme 8, macrocycle 30 can be treated with hydrazine to form the corresponding hydrazide 43. Exposure of 43 to CDI (or a related reagent) affects cyclization to generate oxadiazolone 44. Subsequent removal of the N-Boc-protecting group of 44 provides the desired analog 45. Additional heterocyclic acid isosteres can be prepared from the cyano-substituted macrocycle 46 (Scheme 9). Intermediate 32 can be activated with a suitable chloroformate, such as isobutyl chloroformate. Treatment of the resulting mixed anhydride with ammonia followed by subsequent dehydration using, for example Burgess reagent can furnish the nitrile 46. Additional heterocyclic analogs, such as the oxadiazolone or oxadiazolethione 48 and tetrazole 49 can be prepared from the cyano-substituted intermediate 46 as outlined in Scheme 10. Hydroxyacetimidamide 47, derived from treatment of 46 with hydroxylamine can be cyclized with CDI or TDI (1,1′-thiocarbonyldiimidazole) to provide the oxadiazolone or oxadiazolethione intermediate, respectively. Base-promoted hydrolysis and N-Boc deprotection can then afford the desired analogs 48. Alternatively, treatment of nitrile 46 with sodium azide and a catalysis, such a Zn(II) bromide provides the tetrazole intermediate. Subsequent ester hydrolysis and Boc-deprotection provides the desired tetrazole analog 49. EXAMPLES General Experimental All reactions were carried out with continuous magnetic stirring under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen or argon. All evaporations and concentrations were carried out on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. Commercial reagents were used as received without additional purification. Solvents were commercial anhydrous grades and were used without further drying or purification. Flash chromatography was performed using prepacked RediSep® Rf silica gel columns on a CombiFlash Companion machine. Preparative Reverse Phase HPLC was performed with a linear gradient elution using H2O/MeOH or H2O/MeCN mixtures buffered with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or 10 mM NH4OAc and detection at 220 nm on one of the following columns: Shimadzu Sunfire S10 30×250 mm (flow rate=40 mL/min), or C18 Phenenomenex Luna S5 ODS 21×100 mm (flow rate=20 mL/min), or YMC S5 ODS 20×100 mm (flow rate=20 mL/min) or Waters XBridge C18 19×250 mm (flow rate=20 mL/min) Preparative Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC) was performed using 78% CO2/MeOH buffered with 0.1% diethylamine and detection at 220 nm on a Chiralpak AS-H IDS 25×3 cm column (flow rate=85 mL/min).

The HTRF signal, ratio of fluorescence intensities at emission wavelengths for fluorescein acceptor (520 nm) and terbium donor (615 nm), the 520/615 ratio, generated by the reaction was then measured on the Envision Plate Reader. Inhibition data were calculated from the 520/615 ratio generated by the no protein control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay was 0.5 nM N-His-BIR2-3(125-356, C202A/C213G, XIAP), 20 nM fluorescein labeled dimeric SMAC peptide, 0.25 nM anti-His-Tb-Fab, and 0.1% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required for inhibiting 50% of the HTRF signal (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 3 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven serially diluted concentrations. IC50 and Ki values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.
