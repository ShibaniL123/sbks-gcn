STANNOUS FLUORESCENT PROBE FIELD OF THE INVE TION Fluorescent probes selectively chelating Sn2+. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION . Stannous (Sn2+) is added to toothpaste to prevent dental plaque and oral disease. Sn2+ is found to effectively inhibit certain bacteria that can lead to tooth decay in human interproximal dental plaque. More recently, there has been increasing interest in the biological roles of Sn2+ because tin is an essential trace mineral for humans and is found in the greatest amount in the adrenal gland, liver, brain, spleen and thyroid gland. There is some evidence that tin is involved in growth factors and cancer prevention. Deficiency of tin may result in poor growth and hearing loss, but excess tin accumulation can negatively affect respiratory and digestive systems. However, studies of the physiological role and bacteriostatic mechanism of tin ion are restricted by the lack of versatile Sn2+ detection methods applicable to living cells - either eukaryotic or prokaryotic. There is a need for chemical probe that is highly selective for Sn2+ in the presence of various metal ions and will exhibit high fluorescence upon Sn2+ chelation. There is a further need for such probe for use in living cells. There is yet a further need for a probe that minimizes background noise while providing high fluoresce intensity in living cells consistent where Sn2+ is found in the cell. It is an advantage is to have a probe that works well in pH conditions in an organelle that plays a role in Sn accumulation in the cell. It is a further advantage to have a probe that is relatively easy and simple to synthesize. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention address this need by the surprising discovery of a Sn + fluorescent probe containing rhodamine B derivative moiety as fluorophore, linked via amide moiety to a carbazate group. The use of this class of probe compounds is demonstrated as an imaging probe for monitoring Sn2+ in living cells to study the physiological function of Sn2+ in biological systems. This class of compounds is particularly useful given the additional surprising discovery that lysosomes appear to be an organelle where Sn concentrations are found. And given the rather acidic microenvironment of this organelle, the probes of the present invention exhibit high fluorescent intensity and yet minimizes background noise, compared to other probes that are otherwise subject to low pH induced fluoresce. In other words, a comparative probe, given the acidity of the lysosome, leads to undesirably induce fluorescence emission (thereby generating background noise).

Then the bacteria are collected by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 2 min and rinsed with Saline (pH = 7.0). The process is repeated three times before imaging. After washing with Saline (2 mL x 3) to remove the excess probes, the bacteria is cultured in the presence of the 50 μΜ SnF2 at 37 °C on a shaker bed at 400 rpm for 60 min. Then the bacteria are collected by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 2 min and rinsed with Saline (pH = 7.0). The process was repeated three times before imaging. The light source is at = 543 nm provided excitation and emission are collected in the range = 560-660 nm. Metal ion response is described. Fluorescent 'turn on' probe is conducive for detection target. The solution of Compound Rl or R2 (20 μΜ) in ethanol-water (1 : 1, v/v, PH 7.04) is non- fluorescent. With addition of Sn2+ (0-20 eq) , fluorescence at 580 nm is turned on and grown drastically with an excitation of 560 nm (Fig la and lc) due to the ring open reaction of rhodamine induced by Sn2+ chelating. High-level selectivity is of paramount importance for an excellent chemosensor. Compounds Rl and R2 show selectivity on sensing Sn2+. The solution of Rl and R2 (20 μΜ) in ethanol-water (1 : 1, v/v, PH 7.04) are tuning on just in the presence of Sn and Cr , while other transition and heavy metal ions such as K , Ag , Ca , Mg , Zn , Pb , Ni , Mn , Co , Cd , Hg , displayed minimal enhancement with an excitation of 560 nm (Fig lb and Id). Metal ion response of Rl and R2 are suited for detection of Sn2+ in living Streptococcus mutans cells. Figure 1 (a) and (c) show the fluorescence spectra of comparative Compound Rl and inventive Compound R2 (20 μΜ) in ethanol-water (1 : 1, v/v, pH 7.04) upon addition of 0-20 eq of Sn2+. Figure 1 (b) and (d) show the fluorescent spectra of Compounds Rl and R2 (2.0 x 10~5 M) upon various metal ions (20.0 x 10 5 M) in ethanol-water (1 : 1, v/v, pH 7.04) with an excitation of 560 nm. The impact of pH values on fluorescence is described. The pirolactam ring of the rhodamine derivatives will open in a certain pH range and indicates the fluorescence of rhodamine. It is therefore necessary to check the fluorescence properties of Compounds Rl and R2 in solutions with different pH values. Furthermore, in the cell, the acidity of different organelles may vary greatly. For example, the normal pH of lysosomes is 4.5-5.5, which may induce ring opening of Rl or R2. Considering the application of Sn2+ probe Rl and R2 intracellular or extracellular may be disturbed by the pH, the acid-base titration experiments are carried out by adjusting the pH with an aqueous solution of NaOH and HC1 in Phosphate- Buffered Saline (Fig.2 a and b ). The titration revealed that the pH range for inducing Compounds Rl or R2 fluorescence turning on is 2.5-6 or 2-4.5, respectively. It is predicted that Rl will be turned on by lysosomes in cell without Sn2+ present. Figure 2 shows the dependence of fluorescence at 580 nm of comparative Compound Rl and inventive Compound R2 (10 μΜ) at different pH in pbs solution. Excitation was at 560 nm. Fluorescence imaging of intracellular Sn2+ is described. Sn2+is usually added to toothpaste, so oral epithelial cells are most likely to come into contact with Sn2+. The Kb cells are a good candidate for explored Sn2+ distribution in cell level by fluorescence imaging. Here the practical applicability of Rl and R2 as a Sn2+ probe in the fluorescence imaging of living Kb cells is investigated. Firstly, the Kb cells are separately stained with 10 μΜ of Compound Rl or R2 at 37 °C for 30 min. As determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy, Rl gave fluorescence emission in a site of Kb cells without Sn2+ present (fig 3 .bl); R2 gave scarcely fluorescence (fig 3. b2). This result is consistent with the pH titration experiment that lysosomes acidity may induce Rl fluorescence emission. R2 gave scarcely fluorescence due its lower pH response. This demonstrates the superiority of R2 over Rl given the greater diversity of pH environments that R2 may be used, and subsequently less background noise, particularly in more acidic environments like lysosomes. Furthermore, when the cells are supplemented with Compound Rl or R2 in the PBS for 30 min at 37 °C and then incubated with 50 μΜ Sn2+ under the same conditions, inventive Compound R2 gave a significant fluorescence increasing from the certain intracellular region (Fig 3 .c2, f2) whereas comparative Compound Rl showed slightly changing in fluorescence intensity (fig 3 .cl, fl). Accordingly, cell imaging experiment indicate that R2 is more suited for detection Sn2+ at a cell level. Furthermore, Rl and R2 may be specificity targeting for lysosomes, due to Rl and R2 bear the groups similar to 'dimethylethylamino' that is the targeting anchor for lysosomes. Figure 3 shows CLSM images of KB cells (al-cl) and (a2-c2). Cells separately incubated with 10μΜ of Compounds Rl and R2 for 30 min, (dl-fl) and (d2-f2) followed incubated with 50μΜ SnF2 for 30 min. Emission was collected in red channel at 560-660 nm (bl, el, b2, e2); al, dl, a2, d2 are bright field images and cl, fl, c2, f2 are overlay images, respectively (λεχ = 543 nm). Colocalization experiments are described. To probe the intracellular locations of Compounds Rl or R2, Kb cells were co-stained with Rl and LysoTracker® Green DND or R2, Sn2+ and LysoTracker® Green DND, which is a commercially available marker for lysosomes and has good separation in excitation and emission spectra with Rl and R2. As shown in Figure 4al~dl, the fluorescence images between Rl and lysotracker overlapped very well. This result is consistent with the pH titration experiment and fluorescence imaging of intracellular Sn2+, that Rl accumulates in lysosomes and exhibits acidity induced fluorescence emission. Furthermore, Sn2+ can also locate in lysosomes and enhance the fluorescence of Rl (fig 3 .cl, fl). Fluorescence of R2 induced by Sn2+ and lysotracker overlapped very well, which indicates that R2 can detection Sn2+ in lysosomes; at the same time fluorescence signal of R2 demonstrates distribution of Sn2+. Figure 4 shows CLSM images of KB cells (al- dl). Cells are incubated with 10 μΜ of comparative Compound Rl and ΙμΜ LysoTracker Green for 30 min; (a2-d2) successively incubated with 10 μΜ of inventive Compound R2, 50μΜ SnF2, ΙμΜ LysoTracker Green each for 20 min. Emission is collected in red channel (bl, b2) at 560-660 nm (λεχ = 543 nm) or in green channel at 500-540 nm (λεχ = 488 nm); al, a2, are bright field images and dl, d2 are overlay images, respectively. Without wishing to be bound by theory, Compounds Rl and R2 may be specificity targeting for lyosomes because these compounds have a groups similar to "dimethylethylamino" which is reported as a targeting anchor for lysosomes. Therefore, it's not clear whether Sn2+ is widely distributed in the cell or accumulated in lysosomes. To help answer this question, comparative colocalization experiment is carried out. Firstly, the Kb cells are stained with 50 μΜ Sn2+ at 37 °C for 30 min, and then separately incubated with 10 μΜ of Compound Rl and ΙμΜ LysoTracker® Green DND or Compound R2 and 1 μΜ LysoTracker® Green DND under the same conditions. As determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy, Rl and R2 give fluorescence emission in a site of Kb cells (Fig.5 bl, b2), which overlap with LysoTracker® Green DND very well (Fig.5 dl, b2). There was no fluorescence in other site intracellular. This surprising result indicated that Sn2+ is internalized into cells and leading to accumulation of the ions in lysosomes. This may be a transmission path of Sn. Accordingly, inventive Compound R2 is superior over Rl in this application. Many pharmaceutical agents, including various large and small molecules, must be delivered specifically to particular cell organelles in order to efficiently exert their therapeutic action. Such delivery is still mainly an unresolved problem, but targeting detection is helpful attempt. Figure 5 shows CLSM images of KB cells (al- dl). Cells are successively incubated with 50μΜ SnF2 , 10 μΜ of comparative Compound Rl and ΙμΜ LysoTracker Green each for 20 min; (a2-d2) successively incubated with 50μΜ SnF2, 10μΜ of inventive Compound R2 and ΙμΜ LysoTracker Green each for 20 min. Emission is collected in red channel (bl, b2) at 560-660 nm (λεχ = 543 nm) or in green channel at 500-540 nm (λεχ = 488 nm); al, a2, are bright field images and dl, d2 are overlay images, respectively. Fluorescence imaging of Sn2+ in bacteria is described. It has been reported that Sn2+ can inhibit Streptococcus mutans. The practical applicability of Compounds Rl and R2 as a Sn2+ probe in the fluorescence imaging of living Streptococcus mutans (ATCC® 700610™) are investigated. Firstly, the Streptococcus mutans (ATCC® 700610™) are separately stained with ΙΟμΜ Compound Rl or R2 at 37 °C for 60 min. As determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy, Compounds Rl and R2 gave no fluorescence emission without Sn2+ present (Fig 6. bl, b2). When the Streptococcus mutans are supplemented with Rl or R2 in the PBS for 60 min at 37 °C and then incubated with 50 μΜ Sn2+ under the same conditions, Rland R2 gave a significant fluorescence increasing (fig 6 .el, e2). The overlay of fluorescence and Brightfield images revealed that the fluorescence signals are localized in the Streptococcus mutans (ATCC® 700610™) (Figure 6.fl,f2), indicating that the Sn2+ plays its physiological role within bacteria. This data provides evidence for antibacterial mechanism of Sn2+. Figure 6 shows CLSM images of streptococcus mutans (ATCC® 700610™). (al-cl) and (a2-c2) Cells are separately incubated with 10μΜ comparative Compound Rl and inventive Compound R2 for 30 min, (dl-fl) and (d2-f2) followed incubated with 50μΜ SnF2 for 30 min. Emission is collected in red channel at 560-660 nm (bl, el, b2, e2); al, dl, a2, d2 are bright field images andcl, fl, c2, f2 are overlay images, respectively (λεχ = 543 nm). In summary, the biological application of inventive Compound R2 is demonstrated by the imaging of Sn2+ in Kb cells and Streptococcus mutans (ATCC® 700610™). Furthermore compound R2 as lysosomes tracker is demonstrated by the distribution of Sn2+ in cells and bacteria, which is helpful to research of pharmaceutical agents delivery and antibacterial mechanism of Sn2+.
