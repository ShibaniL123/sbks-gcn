1-(1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-6-(3'-methyl-[1,4'-bipiperidin]-1'-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine hydrochloride
Step 1. (Z)-3,5-Dichloro-2-((2-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)hydrazono)methyl)pyrazine and (E)-3,5-dichloro-2-((2-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)hydrazono)methyl)pyrazine
To a solution of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (22.85 mL, 134.25 mmol) in THF (200 mL) at −40° C. was added n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 56.39 mL, 140.96 mmol). The mixture was stirred at −40° C. for 30 min. In a separate flask, ethyl formate (10.85 mL, 134.25 mmol) and 2,6-dichloropyrazine (10 g, 67.13 mmol) were dissolved in THF (200 mL) and cooled to −90° C. The lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine solution was added to the 2,6-dichloropyrazine solution via cannula over 30 min at −90° C. The mixture was stirred at −90° C. for 1 h and then acetic acid (7.68 mL, 134.25 mmol) was added, followed by (1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)hydrazine hydrochloride (Example 1, step 1, 8.11 g, 33.56 mmol). The mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature and stirred at room temperature for 6 h. The mixture was filtered through a silica gel-celite plug, concentrated under reduced pressure and then the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (20 to 100% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to provide the title compound (6.2 g, 25% yield) as a viscous orange oil.
