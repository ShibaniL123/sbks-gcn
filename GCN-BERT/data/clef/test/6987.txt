Step 5. 7-Bromo-2-methylimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine
A solution of 7-bromo-N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-methylimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine (8.52 g, 24.5 mmol) in TFA (12.4 mL, 161 mmol) was stirred at 80° C. for 18 h. The reaction mixture was treated with additional TFA (12.4 mL, 161 mmol) and stirred at 80° C. for 5 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated and then diluted with toluene and re-concentrated (3×) to give 13.7 g of a crude green solid. The crude material was diluted with ethyl acetate (82 mL) and stirred at 80° C. for 45 min. This material did not completely dissolve. The mixture was cooled to 20° C., diluted with hexanes (82 mL) over 5 min, and stirred overnight. The solids were filtered and washed with hexanes to give the desired product (8.43 g, 99%) as a green solid. LCMS for C6H7BrN5 (M+H)+: m/z=228.0, 230.0; Found: 228.0, 230.0.
