Step 4: 3,5-Dichloro-4-(5-fluoro-2-methyl-4-oxo-1,7-naphthyridin-1 (4H)-yl)benzonitrile
A mixture of 3-(2,6-dichloro-4-cyanophenyl)-6-(3,5-difluoropyridin-4-yl)-2,2-difluoro-4-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1,3,2-oxazaborinin-1-ium-2-uide (17.16 g, 41.3 mmol) and K2CO3 (28.5 g, 206 mmol) in THF (110 ml) and MeOH (55 mL) was heated at 50Â° C. for 1.5 hours. To the reaction mixture was added EtAOc. The solution was washed with water and brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (0-100% EtOAc in heptane) to provide the title compound (8.26 g, 57%).
