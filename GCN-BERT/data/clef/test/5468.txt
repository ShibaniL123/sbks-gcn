Step 4: Preparation of 5-(benzyloxy)-2-[4-(benzyloxy)phenyl]-3-methyl-1-[[4-(triphenylmethoxy)phenyl]methyl]-1H-indole
In a 50 mL round bottom flask, sodium hydride (105.0 mg, 4.38 mmol, 1.10 equiv) was added to a solution of 5-(benzyloxy)-2-[4-(benzyloxy)phenyl]-3-methyl-1H-indole (1.0 g, 2.38 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in N,N-dimethylformamide (20 mL) at 0° C. in a water/ice bath. The resulting mixture was stirred for 10 min at 0° C., and then was added by 1-(bromomethyl)-4-(triphenylmethoxy)benzene (1.3 g, 3.03 mmol, 1.30 equiv). The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 h at 0° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of water. The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL×3) and the organic layers were combined, washed with brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was applied onto a silica gel column eluting with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:5). This resulted in 1.2 g (66%) of 5-(benzyloxy)-2-[4-(benzyloxy)phenyl]-3-methyl-1-[[4-(triphenylmethoxy)phenyl]methyl]-1H-indole as brown solid.
