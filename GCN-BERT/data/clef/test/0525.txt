METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR PREPARATION OF NUCLEIC ACIDS TECHNICAL FIELD The presently disclosed subject matter relates to methods, compositions, and kits for preparing nucleic acids. The nucleic acids prepared using the presently disclosed subject matter can be employed in high throughput (ΗΤ) analytical techniques including, but not limited to real-time quantitative PCR, qualitative PCR, isothermal amplification, molecular marker assisted breeding, SNP discovery, genotyping, and GMO detection. The presently disclosed subject matter can also be employed in low throughput and quick point-of-care diagnostic applications. BACKGROUND A goal of plant breeding is to combine, in a single plant, various desirable traits. For field crops such as corn, these traits can include greater yield and better agronomic quality. However, genetic loci that influence yield and agronomic quality are not always known, and even if known, their contributions to such traits are frequently unclear. Once discovered, however, desirable genetic loci can be selected for as part of a breeding program in order to generate plants that carry desirable traits. An exemplary approach for generating such plants includes the transfer by introgression of nucleic acid sequences from plants that have desirable genetic information into plants that do not by crossing the plants using traditional breeding techniques. Desirable loci can be introgressed into commercially available plant varieties using marker-assisted selection (MAS) or marker-assisted breeding (ΜΑΒ). MAS and ΜΑΒ involve the use of one or more of the molecular markers for the identification and selection of those plants that contain one or more loci that encode desired traits. Such identification and selection can be based on selection of informative markers that are associated with desired traits. However, even when desirable genetic loci are known, the analysis of the genomes of plants that carry the desirable genetic loci can be extremely timeconsuming. Not only do samples need to be isolated from plants, but the genomic contents of the samples must be isolated and analyzed, usually individually and in isolation from all other such samples. Successful application of a genome analysis system thus typically requires pure, high-quality genomic DNA (gDNA), and having a highly specific, reproducible, and efficient method for preparing the same with quickly and with low cost would be desirable. It would be further desirable if such a system could be automated or otherwise designed for high-throughput applications. Additionally, such a system should preferably remove any and all inhibitors of downstream analytical techniques that might be introduced into the gDNA sample. Sources of such inhibitors can include the preparation reagents themselves as well as components of the plant tissues and/or cells that remain in the isolated gDNA sample. In particular, isolation of plant gDNA frequently results in the presence of high levels of polysaccharides, polyphenols, pigments, and/or other secondary metabolites (see Wen & Deng, 2002), the presence of which can make gDNA preparations unusable in downstream analyses (see Michiels etal., 2003; Qiang et al., 2004).

An object of the presently disclosed subject matter having been stated hereinabove, and which is achieved in whole or in part by the presently disclosed subject matter, other objects will become evident as the description proceeds when taken in connection with the accompanying drawing and examples as best described herein below. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Figure 1 is a graph showing results of an allelic discrimination (SNP) assay. Using the Sequence Detection System (SDS) software, allele calls were made based on the fluorescence for the two dyes measured in each sample. The different locations on the plot represent different zygosity calls for the tested samples. The negative samples, which did not contain DNA, are shown as black crosses and represented as an “undetermined” result. The experimental results show that the majority of the seeds where homozygous for Allele 2, with 7 samples heterozygous for Alleles 1 and 2, and only a few samples homozygous for Allele 1. The discrete, tight clustering is indicative of the high quality of the DNA used for the reactions. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEQUENCE LISTING SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2 are the nucleotide sequences of exemplary oligonucleotide primers that can be employed (in some embodiments, employed together in a TAQMAN® Assay) to assess the expression of a Zea mays alcohol dehydrogenase gene product. DETAILED DESCRIPTION L General Considerations Various techniques have been developed to isolate nucleic acids from cells and tissues of plants and animals. Exemplary methods for isolation of nucleic acids include those described in Sambrook & Russell, 2001; Ausubel et al., 1988; and Ausubel et al., 1999. A primary method employed for extracting genomic DNA (gDNA) from plants employs cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to precipitate nucleic acids and acidic polysaccharides from solutions of low ionic strength, but can also be used to remove polysaccharides and proteins from solutions of higher ionic strength {e.g., < 0.7 Μ NaCI; see Sambrook & Russell, 2001 ; see also Murray & Thompson, 1980). One of the drawbacks of the CTAB method, however, is that in order to recover the nucleic acids from high ionic strength solutions, a subsequent treatment with organic solvents and alcohol precipitation and/or purification over a cesium chloride gradient is typically required. Such steps are not desirable for a high-throughput method, not only because of the labor, time, and expense involved, but also because if these steps are not taken, the nucleic acid preparation is likely to be contaminated with various inhibitors of downstream analyses. An alternative method for isolating plant gDNA is disclosed in Kotchoni & Gachomo (2009) Mol Biol Rep 36:1633-1636. This multi-step method involves grinding plant tissue, incubating the same in a mixture of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium chloride, spinning down insoluble aggregates, transferring the nucleic acid-containing supernatant to a new vessel, isopropanol precipitation of nucleic acids, re-spinning down the precipitated nucleic acids, performing an ethanol wash, spinning down the washed nucleic acids yet again, drying the nucleic acids, and dissolving the same in a buffer of choice. Given the numerous steps and manipulations required, this method is also largely unsuitable for automation. Additionally, many inhibitors of DNA polymerases are typically present in the resuspended DNA, such that the DNA quality is generally not well suitable for quantitative PCR. A third method for isolating plant gDNA is disclosed in Dilworth & Frey (2000) Plant Molecular Biology Reporter 18:61 -64. This method employs Proteinase Κ and a detergent (e.g., polysorbate 20), but requires several incubations at elevated temperatures (e.g., 65°C). It avoids the alcohol precipitation steps of some of the other methods, but generally the DNA yield is low and quality is poor, leading to unreliable PCR performance even using “regular” (/.℮., non-quantitative) PCR. Additionally, since proteinase Κ is the only reagent that can remove potential inhibitors, no protein inhibitors are typically present in the isolated DNA. The cost of the enzyme itself can negatively impact the usefulness of this method in a high-throughput process. Of course, high per-run costs are also associated with methods that are based on using solid supports such as silica-based supports or magnetic beads to isolate gDNA. A final method for isolating plant gDNA is found in Porcar et al. (2007) Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture 87:2728-2731. This method comprises grinding plant tissue in sodium hydroxide, centrifuging the resulting extract to remove insoluble aggregates, adding sodium acetate to the supernatant containing the nucleic acids, and re-centrifuging to recover the nucleic acids. While this method requires minimal manipulations, the DNA quality is generally quite poor (/.℮., is not sufficiently high to be useful for quantitative PCR), and the vast majority of inhibitors remain in the DNA extracts. In view of these methods, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a simple, fast, relatively inexpensive method for isolating plant gDNA that provides the plant gDNA in sufficient purity that it can be easily and reproducibly employed in molecular biological manipulations that require high purity nucleic acids. Thus, disclosed herein are quick, simple, cheap, and high throughput gDNA (gDNA) extraction methods. The amount and quality of gDNA isolated are sufficiently high to make the presently disclosed methods suitable for quantitative analysis by real-time PCR. The particular components of the presently disclosed reagents have multiple functions in extracting high quality DNA by eliminating contaminants and inhibitors effectively. These functions include: 1) more efficient cell lysis and DNA release by the combination and synergy of alkali and SDS, and this also made the DNA easily accessible to primer and polymerase in PCR; 2) high salt to precipitate SDS-proteins, polysaccharides and other macromolecular complexes; 3) PVP and EDTA to remove polyphenols and stabilize the gDNA; and 4) avoidance of hazardous solvents, PCR inhibitory chemicals, and costly materials including but not limited to magnetic beads and/or other nucleic acid-binding resins. 1L Definitions While the following terms are believed to be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the following definitions are set forth to facilitate explanation of the presently disclosed subject matter.

Compositions and Methods for Isolation of qDNA In some embodiments, the presently disclosed compositions have been designed to optimize gDNA extraction from plants, although the presently disclosed compositions can also be employed for gDNA extraction from other biological materials including but not limited to animal cells, tissues, and/or organs. In some embodiments, the compositions and methods that employ the same remove inhibitors of DNA polymerases that might be employed in downstream uses and the gDNA is isolated in sufficient amounts and purity that the gDNA can be employed in sensitive applications such as but not limited to quantitative PCR. In some embodiments, the compositions are employed in a high-throughput, automated gDNA extraction method. The compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter comprise two main reagent solutions termed Solution A and Solution Β. Solution A is an alkaline SDS solution, which is designed to lyse plant cells, denature cellular proteins, and release gDNA. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory of operation, Solution A is also believed to bind to lipids and denatured proteins, especially nucleoprotein in the plant chromosomes. Solution Β is a buffered solution of high salt (e.g., at least about 3 Μ sodium acetate). The buffer is intended to lower the pH of the gDNA solution to in some embodiments less than about 9.5, in some embodiments less than about 9.0, in some embodiments less than about 8.5, in some embodiments less than about 8.0, and in some embodiments less than about 7.5. In some embodiments, the pH of the gDNA solution upon adding Solution Β is about 7.0, 7.5, or 8.0. The other components of Solution Β provide additional benefits to the presently disclosed compositions and methods. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory of operation, the high salt present in Solution Β precipitates the SDS-bound proteins and likely also removes sugars and starches present in the plant cell lysate. In some embodiments, Solution Β also includes additional components such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, which can inactivate polyphenol inhibitors present in the lysate, and/or EDTA to chelate divalent cations such as, but not limited to Mg2+ that can serve as a co-factor for various enzymes that damage nucleic acids. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter also provides methods for isolating gDNA from biological material using the compositions disclosed herein. Thus, in some embodiments the presently disclosed methods comprise (a) contacting a sample comprising gDNA with a first solution comprising hydroxide and a detergent under conditions and for a time sufficient to degrade a cell wall, a cell membrane, a nuclear membrane, or combinations thereof, and/or to denature the gDNA; (b) mixing into the solution resulting from step (a) a second solution comprising high salt and sufficient buffering capacity to reduce the pH of the solution to less than 10, thereby producing a neutralized preparation; (c) centrifuging the sample at a speed and for a length of time sufficient to clarify the neutralized preparation; and (d) removing insoluble material from the neutralized and clarified preparation, whereby a solution of gDNA is produced. IV. Methods for Analyzing and/or Employing Isolated GDNA The presently disclosed subject matter also provides methods for analyzing gDNA prepared using the methods disclosed herein, as well as for employing the gDNA so prepared in one or more downstream applications. Any analytical and/or other downstream technique that can be employed on gDNA could be performed with the gDNA isolated by the presently disclosed methods using the compositions disclosed herein. The following includes a non-limiting listing of exemplary analytical and/or other downstream techniques for which the gDNA isolated by the presently disclosed methods using the compositions disclosed herein would be appropriate. IV.A. Methods for PCR, Including Quantitative PCR (qPCR) In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides methods for performing PCR, including but not limited to qPCR, using gDNA prepared by the presently disclosed methods. In some embodiments, the methods comprise providing a gDNA sample prepared by the presently disclosed method and performing PCR under conditions wherein the Cj value can be collected in real-time for quantitative analysis, whereby qPCR of the gDNA sample is performed. As used herein, the phrase “Cj value” refers to “threshold cycle”, which is defined as the “fractional cycle number at which the amount of amplified target reaches a fixed threshold”. In some embodiments, it represents an intersection between an amplification curve and a threshold line. The amplification curve is typically in an “S” shape indicating the change of relative fluorescence of each reaction (Y-axis) at a given cycle (X-axis), which in some embodiments is recorded during PCR by a real-time PCR instrument. The threshold line is in some embodiments the level of detection at which a reaction reaches a fluorescence intensity above background. See Livak & Schmittgen (2001) 25 Methods 402-408. It is a relative measure of the concentration of the target in the PCR. Generally, good CT values for quantitative assays such as qPCR are in some embodiments in the range of 10-40 for a given reference gene. Additionally, good Cj values for quantitative assays such as qPCR show a linear response range with proportional dilutions of target gDNA. In some embodiments, qPCR is performed under conditions wherein the Cj value can be collected in real-time for quantitative analysis. For example, in a typical quantitative PCR experiment, DNA amplification is monitored at each cycle of PCR during the extension stage. The amount of fluorescence generally increases above the background when DNA is in the log linear phase of amplification. In some embodiments, the CT value is collected at this time point. IV.B. Methods for Performing Genome Analysis The presently disclosed subject matter also provides in some embodiments methods of performing genome analysis, including but not limited to genetic marker analysis, such as but not limited to genetic marker analysis related to molecular marker assisted breeding and/or selection; locus copy number analysis; zygosity analysis; seed purity assessment based on molecular marker profiles; and/or plant pathogen and/or disease control. In some embodiments, the methods comprise providing a gDNA sample prepared by the presently disclosed method and performing detecting the presence of a genetic marker (including, but not limited to a single nucleotide polymorphism; SNP) present in the gDNA sample. In some embodiments, the detecting methodology includes a PCR reaction on the gDNA sample prepared by the presently disclosed method, wherein the PCR reaction employs one or more oligonucleotide primers designed to detect the presence or absence of a genetic marker of interest. In some embodiments, the PCR reaction is qPCR employed for determining copy number of a genetic marker in the genome of an individual. Generalized techniques for assessment of copy number can be found in Livak & Schmittgen (2001) 25 Methods 402-408, Abad etal. (2010) 5 BiotechnolJ412-420, D’haene et al. (2010) 50 Methods 262-270, Ji et at. (2012)14 J Mol Diagnostics 280-285, etc. Τ GDNA prepared using the compositions and methods of the presently disclosed subject matter can be employed in these exemplary methods. In some embodiments, the assessment of copy number is in the context of determining the number of copies of a transgene in a transgenic cell and/or subject, and in some embodiments the assessment of copy number is in the context of determining the amplification or the loss of a genetic locus such as, but not limited to a gene. In some embodiments, gDNA prepared using the compositions and methods of the presently disclosed subject matter can be employed in zygosity analysis. As used herein, the phrase “zygosity analysis” refers to any technique that can be used to determine whether a cell, tissue, organ, or a subject is nullizygous, hemizygous, heterozygous, or homozygous for a particular nucleic acid sequence of interest. Generalized techniques for zygosity analysis include, but are not limited to those disclosed in Tesson etal. (2010) 597 Methods Mol Biol 277-285. For example, the gDNA prepared using the compositions and methods of the presently disclosed can be used in subsequent PCR with target- and/or allele- specific assays in zygosity analysis, wherein the DNA prepared using the presently disclosed compositions and/or methods can serve as template for PCR amplification. In some embodiments, gDNA prepared using the compositions and methods of the presently disclosed subject matter can be employed in analyzing seed purity based on molecular marker profiles. By way of example and not limitation, the gDNA prepared using the compositions and methods of the presently disclosed subject matter can be employed in a molecular marker analysis, and the purity of a given collection of seeds can be determined by identifying whether or not the seeds constitute a single molecular marker profile or if multiple profiles can be identified. In the latter instance, the presence of multiple marker profiles or SNP genotype profiles for one or more selected genes can suggest either heterozygosity in the seeds {e.g., two different alleles at a given locus are present in the seeds in equal proportions), whereas the presence of multiple marker profiles for one or more selected genes can also suggest that the seeds are not isogenic (/.℮., comprise a plurality of genomes). In some embodiments, gDNA prepared using the compositions and methods of the presently disclosed subject matter can be employed in or plant pathogen and/or disease detection and/or monitoring. EXAMPLES The following Examples provide illustrative embodiments. Certain aspects of the following Examples are disclosed in terms of techniques and procedures found or contemplated by the present inventors to work well in the practice of the embodiments. In light of the present disclosure and the general level of skill in the art, those of skill will appreciate that the following Examples are intended to be exemplary only and that numerous changes, modifications, and alterations can be employed without departing from the scope of the presently claimed subject matter. EXAMPLE 1 Preliminary Experiments to Optimize Reagent Concentrations A series of experiments were performed in which various concentrations of NaOH, SDS, ammonium acetate (NH4Ac), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP40), and/or EDTA were employed in the preparation of gDNA from leaf tissues of maize. The following describes the general procedure that was used for each test. A sample of two leaf discs, each about 6 mm in diameter, was loaded in a deep well block (Costar 96-well block; Fisher Scientific) containing one steel bead (3/16 inch chrome steel balls; Bearing and Industrial Sales, Inc.) in each well. The block was cooled in a -80°C freezer for at least one hour, after which the samples were ground while frozen on a Kinetic Laboratory Equipment Company (KLECO) tissue grinder for 1 minute at setting 9 at room temperature (RT). After grinding, the block was briefly centrifuged in a bench-top centrifuge (Centrifuge 581 OR; Eppendorf) to remove tissue debris from the lid. 100 μΐ of Solution A (see Table 1 below) was then added and the sample was ground for an additional 1 minute at setting 9 using the KLECO tissue grinder at RT. After this second grinding step, the samples were incubated for 3 minutes at RT with occasional inverting. The block was again briefly centrifuged to remove tissue debris from the lid, and 50 μΐ of Solution Β (see Table 1 below) was added to each well. After the addition of Solution Β, the block was vigorously inverted 15-20 times at RT. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4000 rpm (3220 χ g) at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred and then diluted in 1χΤΕ (10 η∩Μ Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Table 1 Variable Tested Amount Solution A NaOH (Μ) 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 SDS (%) 0 0.25 0.5 1.0 Solution Β NH4Ac (Μ) 0 3.0 4.5 6.0 EDTA (mM) 0 2.5 5.0 10.0 PVP40 (%) 0 0.5 1.0 2.0 Solution A Volume (μ1) 60 100 Fold Dilution 5 (7.5) 10 20 40 Exemplary Compositions for Solutions A and Β In the following EXAMPLES, ranges and combinations of NaOH and SDS for Solution A listed in Table 1 were tested, and ranges of Solution Β components listed in Table 1 were also tested. This series of experiments sought to optimize the concentrations of the individual components of Solutions A and Β as as well as investigate the effect that different volumes of Solution A and fold dilutions might have on the quality of the nucleic acids isolated by the disclosed methods. EXAMPLE 2 Comparison Tests with Respect to Assay Volume at Different Dilutions Two different volumes of Solution A, 60 μΐ and 100 μΐ, were tested. Solution A was 0.2 Μ NaOH and 0.25% SDS. Solution Β was 0.2 Μ Tris pH 7.5, 3Μ NH4Ac, 5η∩Μ EDTA, and 1% PVP40. As described in EXAMPLE 1, each of the samples contained two (2) leaf discs of approximately 6 mm in diameter. The protocol was the same as in EXAMPLE 1 except for the different volumes of Solution A employed. As in EXAMPLE 1, the supernatant was transferred and then diluted in 1χΤΕ. For the present and the following EXAMPLES, a range of dilutions were made of the supernatant. The DNA samples were then used forqPCR. TAQMAN® assays were performed on the endogenous maize gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase following standard methodology using primers having the sequences disclosed herein as SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2, JUMPSTART™ TAQ READYMIX™ (Sigma-Aldrich), and the ABI PRISM® 7900ΗΤ sequence detection system. The results, shown in Table 2, are expressed as CT values plus or minus one standard deviation. Two samples were prepared for each volume and four replicates of each sample were used for the CT value calculation in the Table. Table 2 Effect of Volume of Solution A and Sample Dilution on qPCR Analysis* Volume of Solution A Dilution (μ1) 1:5 1:10 1:20 1:40 60 21,6±0.2 22.7±0.3 23.7±0.2 24.7±0.2 100 22.1 ±0.2 23.2±0.3 24.2±0.2 25.2±0.2 * Results are expressed as CT values following qPCR of the maize alcohol dehydrogenase gene The Cj, or threshold cycle, was defined as the intersection between an amplification curve and a threshold line. It was a relative measure of the concentration of the target in the PCR. The Cj value increased with a decreasing amount of template. Generally, good CT values for quantification were in the range of 10-40 for a given reference gene. Additionally, good Cj values for quantification showed a linear response range with proportional dilutions. The relatively low devalues in Table 2 indicated that the DNA samples were good for quantitative analysis, starting at 1:5 dilutions, for both volumes of Solution A. The single unit increase of Cj for each dilution (for example, in the samples with 60 μΐ Solution A, CT = 22.7 for the 1:10 dilution, 23.7 for 1:20 dilution, and 24.7 for 1:40 dilution) indicated that this assay was within its linear response range, such that quantitative analysis could be performed. Therefore, the quality of DNA isolated using this method was suitable for qPCR, as well as genotyping and other qualitative analyses. EXAMPLE 3 Comparison Tests with Respect to EDTA Concentration in Solution Β To evaluate the contribution of the metal chelator EDTA in the presently disclosed methods, concentrations in the range of 0 to 10 η∩Μ EDTA were tested in Solution Β. Solution A was the same as in EXAMPLE 2. For this EXAMPLE, Solution Β was 0.2 Μ Tris and various concentrations of EDTA. The methodology was as described in EXAMPLES 1 and 2. As in EXAMPLE 2, the DNA samples clarified by centrifugation were diluted in 1 χ ΤΕ prior to qPCR analysis. qPCR was performed using TAQMAN® assays and the ABI PRISM® 7900ΗΤ sequence detection system as described in EXAMPLE 2. Results are expressed as Cj values plus or minus one standard deviation. Results are shown in Table 3. Two samples were prepared for each EDTA concentration, and four replicates of each sample were used for the CT value calculation in the Table. Table 3 Effect of EDTA Concentration in Solution Β on qPCR Analysis* Dilution EDTA (mM) 1:10 Dilution 1:20 1:40 0 25.0 ±0.2 26.6 ±0.5 27.7 ± 0.3 2.5 23.8 ±0.2 25.1 ±0.1 26.1 ±0.1 5 23.1 ±0.3 24.2 ±0.2 25.4 ± 0.4 10 23.6 ±0.9 24.7 ±0.1 25.8 ±0.1 * Results are expressed as CT values following qPCR of the maize alcohol dehydrogenase gene At 5 η∩Μ EDTA, there was an increase of about 1 Cj value as the sample dilution doubled from 1:10 to 1:20 and again to 1:40. This indicated that the presence of 5 η∩Μ EDTA resulted in data that were in the linear response range, which is typically advantageous for quantitative analysis. Therefore, 5 η∩Μ was selected as a desirable concentration of EDTA in Solution Β. EXAMPLE 4 Comparison Tests with Respect to PVP40 Concentration in Solution Β PVP40 is an effective deactivator of polyphenolic compounds, which are commonly present in plant materials and particularly in older tissues. “Older” maize leaves are typically a few months old, and appear dark green or yellowing. This is in contrast to young maize leaf tissue, which is generally no more than a couple weeks old and light green in color. Polyphenolic compounds are also known to be present in relatively high concentrations in certain crop plants, such as cotton and lettuce, and are further known to be highly inhibitory towards those polymerases that are typically employed in PCR and qPCR. In this EXAMPLE, various concentrations between 0 to 2.0% of PVP40were tested in Solution Β, which otherwise contained 0.2 Μ Tris pH 7.5,5 η∩Μ EDTA, and 3Μ NH4Ac. Solution A was the same as in EXAMPLES 2 and 3. The methodology was as described in EXAMPLE 1. As in EXAMPLES 2 and 3, the DNA samples clarified by centrifugation were diluted in 1χ ΤΕ prior to qPCR analysis. qPCR was performed using TAQMAN® assays and the ABI PRISM® 7900ΗΤ sequence detection system as described herein above. Results are expressed as Cj values plus or minus one standard deviation. Results are shown in Table 4. As in EXAMPLES 2 and 3, two samples were prepared for each experimental condition, and four replicates of each sample were used for the CT value calculation in the Table.

EXAMPLE 5 Comparison Tests with Respect to NH4Ac Concentrations in Solution Β The effect of different NH4Ac concentration in Solution Β was tested. Solution A was 0.2 Μ NaOH and 0.50% SDS. Solution Β was 0.2 Μ Tris pH 7.5, 5 η∩Μ EDTA, and 1 % PVP40. In this EXAMPLE, concentrations of 0 Μ, 3 Μ, 4.5 Μ, and 6 Μ NH4Ac were tested. The general methodology was as described in the above EXAMPLES, and the clarified DNA samples were diluted in 1χ ΤΕ prior to qPCR analysis as in EXAMPLES 2-4. The results are presented in Table 5. Results are expressed as CT values plus or minus one standard deviation. As in the previous EXAMPLES, two samples were prepared for each experimental condition, and four replicates of each sample were used for the CT value calculation in the Table.

EXAMPLE 6 Comparison Tests with Respect to SDS Concentration in Solution A In this EXAMPLE, the effect of different SDS concentrations in Solution A was tested. Solution A contained 0.2 Μ NaOH and either 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, or 1% SDS. Solution Β was 0.2 Μ Tris pH 7.5, 3 Μ NH4Ac, 5 η∩Μ EDTA, and 1% PVP40. The general methodology was as described in the above EXAMPLES, and the purified DNA samples were diluted prior to qPCR analysis also as described herein above. The results are expressed as Cj values plus or minus one standard deviation as shown in Table 6. As in the previous EXAMPLES, two samples were prepared for each experimental condition, and four replicates of each sample were used for the CT value calculation in the Table.

This suggested that, for this particular EXAMPLE, SDS might not have been necessary. However, up to 1 % SDS did not show negative effects on the qPCR for the 1:10 to 1:40 dilutions of the samples. The high Cj values in the 1:5 dilution, as well as the lack of linearity compared to the other dilutions, indicated that qPCR did not perform desirably for these DNA samples at the 1:5 dilution. EXAMPLE 7 Comparison Tests with Respect to NaOH Concentration in Solution A The effect of NaOH in Solution A was also tested. Solution A was 0.5% SDS plus 0 Μ, 0.1 Μ, 0.2 Μ, or 0.3 Μ NaOH. Solution Β was the same as in EXAMPLE 6. The general methodology was as described herein above examples, and the purified DNA samples were diluted prior to qPCR analysis also as described herein above. The results are expressed as Cj values plus or minus one standard deviation and are shown in Table 7. As in the previous EXAMPLES, two samples were prepared for each experimental condition, and four replicates of each sample were used for the CT value calculation in the Table.

The results indicated that 0.1 Μ to 0.3 Μ NaOH in Solution A provided for low Cj values and a large dynamic range, from 1:10 to 1:40 dilutions. The results further indicated that qPCR did not perform as desired for most DNA samples at the 1:5 dilution. EXAMPLE 8 Comparison Tests with Respect to Both NaOH and SDS Concentrations in Solution A Building on the results of EXAMPLES 6 and 7, this EXAMPLE tested whether additive or synergistic effects could be observed when 0.5% SDS and 0.2 Μ NaOH were employed together in Solution A compared to when these components were employed individually. Solution Β was the same as in EXAMPLES 6 and 7. The general methodology was as described herein above, and the purified DNA samples were diluted prior to qPCR analysis as also described previously. The results are expressed as CT values plus or minus one standard deviation in Table 8. As in the previous EXAMPLES, two samples were prepared for each experimental condition, and four replicates of each sample were used for the CT value calculation in the Table. Table 8 1:7.5 1:10 1:20 1:40 0.5% SDS only 25.1 ±1.1 25.3 ±0.7 26.2 ±0.4 26.3 ±0.4 0.2 Μ NaOH only 23.1 ±0.2 23.5 ±0.2 24.7 ±0.1 25.7 ± 0.1 0.2 Μ NaOH + 0.5% SDS 22.8 ±0.1 22.8 ±0.1 23.9 ±0.1 25.0 ±0.2 Effect of NaOH and SDS Concentration in Solution A on qPCR Analysis* Dilution Combination * Results are expressed as Cj values following qPCR of the maize alcohol dehydrogenase gene The results showed that the NaOH + SDS in combination resulted in here significantly lower CT values as compared to those observed when either 0.5% SDS or 0.2 Μ NaOH were employed individually. Surprisingly, this suggested that the quality of gDNA extracted using both NaOH and SDS together was higher than that ofgDNA extracted using either chemical individually. EXAMPLE 9 Tests with Respect to DNA Stability The stability of gDNA prepared by the method was also examined. Solution A was 0.2 Μ NaOH and 0.25% SDS, and Solution Β was the same as that employed in EXAMPLES 6-8. The general methodology was as described in the above EXAMPLES, and the purified DNA samples were diluted prior to qPCR analysis, also as previously described. Once the DNA sample was diluted into 1χ ΤΕ, qPCR was performed as described in the previous EXAMPLES. This first qPCR performed immediately after the DNA was prepared was notated as week 0. Over 8 weeks, the DNA samples were stored at 4°C and tested by qPCR weekly. qPCR was performed as in the above EXAMPLES. Results are expressed as CT values plus or minus one standard deviation. Representative results are shown in Table 9. Two out of eight samples and four replicates of each sample were used for the Cj values calculated in the table.

EXAMPLE 10 GDNA Extraction Method used for SNP Genotypinq of Rice Seeds To illustrate that the presently disclosed methods could be used for more than the one generalized application described in the previous EXAMPLES, rice seeds were used as a source for DNA extraction, and an allelic discrimination (SNP) assay was performed on the extracted DNA samples. A population of 30 different rice varieties, with 3 representative seeds from each, was examined. Prior to extraction, the rice seeds were incubated at room temperature overnight in distilled water. DNA from the seeds was then extracted according to method described in EXAMPLE 1. A single seed was used for each sample. Solution A was 0.2 Μ NaOH and 0.25% SDS. Solution Β was 0.2 Μ Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 3.0 Μ NH4Ac, 5 η∩Μ EDTA, and 1% PVP40. Samples were diluted ten-fold in 1χ ΤΕ buffer. For the SNP genotyping, a negative control, which contained 1χ ΤΕ buffer with no DNA, was used. The SNP genotyping was performed using 2χ Master Mix (JUMPSTART™ TAQ READYMIX™), 2 primers specific to the two SNP’s being tested, 2 probes, DNA prepared from the disclosed DNA extraction method, and an ABI9700 thermal cycler. Using the Sequence Detection System (SDS) software, allele calls were made based on the fluorescence for the two dyes measured in each sample. The results are shown in Figure 1. The negative samples, which did not contain DNA, are shown in black crosses in the lower left quadrant of Figure 1, and are represented as an “undetermined” result. The experimental results showed that the majority of the seeds where homozygous for allele 2 (clustered blue circles in the upper left quadrant of Figure 1), with 7 samples heterozygous (clustered green circles in the upper right quadrant of Figure 1), and only a few samples homozygous for allele 1 (clustered red circles in the lower right quadrant of Figure 1). The discrete, tight clustering is indicative of the high quality of the DNA used for the reactions. Discussion of the EXAMPLES In sum, the EXAMPLES described above demonstrated the optimization of the DNA preparation method disclosed within. The results for each solution component indicated good Cj values could be obtained using a range of concentrations for the solution components as well as a range for sample dilutions prior to qPCR. As observed for each EXAMPLE, for each component there was a range of concentration and dilution that provided for good qPCR analysis. EXAMPLE 2 indicated that using 60 μΐ or 100 μΐ of Solution A, with sample dilutions of 1:5 to 1:40, were good for qPCR analysis. EXAMPLE 3 indicated that 5 η∩Μ EDTA in Solution Β, with sample dilutions of 1:10 to 1:40, were good for qPCR analysis. EXAMPLE 4 indicated that 0-2% PVP40 in Solution Β, with sample dilutions of 1:10 to 1:40, were good for qPCR analysis. EXAMPLE 5 indicated that 3.0-4.5 Μ NH4Ac in Solution Β, with sample dilutions of 1:10 to 1:40, were good for qPCR analysis. EXAMPLE 6 indicated that 0-1.0% SDS in Solution A, with sample dilutions of 1:10 to 1:40, were good for qPCR analysis. EXAMPLE 7 indicated that 0.1-0.3 Μ NaOH in Solution A, with sample dilutions of 1:10 to 1:40, were good for qPCR analysis. EXAMPLE 8 indicated that 0.5% SDS and 0.2 Μ NaOH, with sample dilutions of 1:10 to 1:40, were good for qPCR analysis. The presently disclosed methods for preparing gDNA were also compared to different existing gDNA preparation procedures as described below. From these experiments it was determined that DNA quality from the presently disclosed methods may be higher than for the other methods tested in terms of tight replicates(small standard deviation) in qPCR and clear allelic discrimination in genotyping, total DNA yield was 3-5 fold higher according to the quantitative analysis by qPCR, very short duration from sample to ready DNA makes the throughput superior to any existing ΗΤ method, running costs were very low because of simple steps and common chemicals, the presently disclosed method employed a minimum of manipulations, and was user- and environment-friendly For example, as compared to the CTAB method of Japelaqhi etal., 2011. the presently disclosed methods were far superior for high throughput applications, provided gDNA of similar if not superior quality, could be performed in substantially less time, and avoided the use of hazardous chemicals. As compared to the SDS-isopropanol method of Kotchoni & Gachomo, 2009, the presently disclosed methods avoided the need to precipitate and dry the gDNA before use, resulted in substantially fewer inhibitors of downstream applications being present in the gDNA preparation, and was superior as a high throughput methodology. As compared to the proteinase Κ method of Dilworth & Frey, 2000, the presently disclosed methods provided greater yields of higher quality gDNA and avoided the use of proteinase Κ, which can inhibit downstream applications and is a relatively expensive reagent. And finally, as compared to the hydroxide/acetate method of Porcar et a!., 2007. the presently disclosed methods provided gDNA of substantially higher quality both with respect to the gDNA perse as well as provided a preparation that lacked the many inhibitors of downstream applications that typically remain in the gDNA prepared using the hydroxide/acetate method of Porcar et a!., 2007. In contrast, the presently disclosed methods represent quick, simple, inexpensive, and high throughput gDNA extraction methods. The quantity and quality of gDNA recovered are typically at least as high or higher than that from standard techniques for ΗΤ analysis and produce gDNA that is suitable for quantitative analysis by real-time quantitative PCR. The particular combination of reagents employed in the presently disclosed methods has multiple functions in extracting high quality gDNA, resulting in effective elimination of contaminants and inhibitors. For example, the presently disclosed methods: 1) generate more efficient cell lysis and gDNA release via the combination and synergy of alkali and SDS, resulting in gDNA that is easily accessible to primers and polymerases in downstream applications; 2) employ high salt to precipitate SDS-proteins, polysaccharides, and other macromolecular complexes that can inhibit downstream applications; 3) include PVP40 and EDTA to remove polyphenols and stabilize the isolated gDNA; and 4) avoid the use of hazardous solvents, PCR inhibitory chemicals, and various other costly reagents and materials. In addition to the maize leaf tissue tested above, this method has also been used successfully on a variety of tissues and seeds from other plants including soybean leaf, sugarcane leaf, wheat leaf, rice seeds, cotton leaf, maize seeds, soybean seeds, and cotton seeds. Real-time quantitative results typically give Cj values in the range of 22 to 25 at 1:10 dilution of the DNA samples, indicative of the high quality of the DNA extracted and demonstrating the broad applicability of the presently disclosed methods to a number of plant and tissue types. Additionally, the presently disclosed methods provide further advantages relative to standard gDNA preparation methods. First, the presently disclosed methods can be employed for most if not all sources of gDNA, and yield gDNA that is of high quality and has been shown to be stable for at least 8 weeks when stored at 4° C. The presently disclosed methods are also easily adaptable to high-throughput procedures and are very economical, using reagents that are relatively inexpensive. And finally, the reagents employed are user- and environmentfriendly.
