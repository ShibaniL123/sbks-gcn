Step 7: preparation of intermediate methyl (2S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4,7-dioxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylate (2g)
To a solution of methyl (2S,4S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4-hydroxy-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylate (2f) (0.361 g, 1.41 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (30 mL) under inert atmosphere at 0Â°C was added the reagent Dess-Martin periodinane (0.847g, 1.41 mmol). The reaction was stirred for 18 h at rt, then the mixture was washed with a saturated sodium hydrogenocarbonate aqueous solution, a 15% sodium thiosulfate solution, water, dried oved Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc 80/20 to 0/100) to afford intermediate methyl (2S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4,7-dioxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylate (2g) (0.333 g, 1.31 mmol, 92%) as a colorless oil.
