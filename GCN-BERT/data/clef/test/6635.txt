Preparation of chloro-2-pyridyl-tert-butylphosphine (Precursor A)
The Grignard for the synthesis of chloro-2-pyridyl-t-butylphosphine is prepared by the “Knochel method” with isopropylmagnesiurn chloride (Angew. Chem. 2004, 43, 2222-2226). The workup is effected according to the method of Budzelaar (Organometallics 1990, 9, 1222-1227).
8.07 ml of a 1.3 M isopropylmagnesium chloride solution (Knochel's reagent) are introduced into a 50 ml round-bottom flask with magnetic stirrer and septum, and cooled to −15° C.
Thereafter, 953.5 μl (10 mmol) of 2-bromopyridine are rapidly added dropwise. The solution immediately turns yellow. It is allowed to warm up to −10° C. The conversion of the reaction is determined as follows: about 100 μl solution are taken and introduced into 1 ml of a saturated ammonium chloride solution. If the solution “bubbles”, not much Grignard has formed yet. The aqueous solution is extracted with a pipette of ether and the organic phase is dried over Na2SO4. A GC of the ethereal solution is recorded. When a large amount of pyridine has formed compared to 2-bromopyridine, conversions are high. At −10° C., there has been little conversion. After warming up to room temperature and stirring for 1-2 hours, the reaction solution turns brown-yellow. A GC test shows complete conversion, Now the Grignard solution can be slowly added dropwise with a syringe pump to a solution of 1.748 g (11 mmol) of dichloro.tert-butylphosphine in 10 ml of THF which has been cooled to −15° C. beforehand. It is important that the dichloro-tert-butylphosphine solution is cooled. At room temperature, considerable amounts of dipyridyl-tert-butylphosphine would be obtained. A clear yellow solution is initially formed, which then turns cloudy. The mixture is left to warm up to room temperature and to stir overnight, According to GC-MS, a large amount of product has formed. The solvent is removed under high vacuum and a whitish solid which is brown in places is obtained. The solid is suspended with 20 ml of heptane and the solid is comminuted in an ultrasound bath. After allowing the white solid to settle out, the solution is decanted. The operation is repeated twice with 10-20 ml each time of heptane, After concentration of the heptane solution under high vacuum, it is distilled under reduced pressure. At 4.6 mbar, oil bath 120° C. and distillation temperature 98° C., the product can be distilled. 1.08 g of a colourless oil are obtained. (50%).
