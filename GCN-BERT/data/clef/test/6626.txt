This upward cascading allows the operator to reach all shelves equally as they each will pass through the operator’s optimal ergonomic height for lifting loads. In addition, when fully retracted upwards, the invention provides an effective Retractable Shelving System space-efficient means of storage. The invention can be scaled in many ways including but not limited to: laundry air-drying shelving, or industrial storage racking. Specification An over-head suspended multi-tiered shelving system which allows for downward deployment and upward retraction of an array of suspended tray assemblies (a.k.a. “shelves”) below. The key distinction of the invention is that the shelf trays individually deploy downward starting with the lowest tray then cascading through upper trays. This upward cascading allows the operator to reach all shelves equally as they each will pass through the operator’s optimal ergonomic height for lifting loads. In addition, when fully retracted upwards, the invention provides an effective space-efficient means of storage. The invention can be scaled in many ways including but not limited to: laundry air-drying shelving, or industrial storage racking. The invention essentially comprises of an upper drive system (refer to Figure), and an array of suspended tray assemblies (refer to Figure 5, 6, 7 & 8). The upper drive system essentially comprises of typically four cable winches (1) (one in each comer), a back-turn preventer (2), and a drive source (3). The chassis, assembly, installation mounting hardware, and overhead support to which the invention shall be anchored, shall meet or exceed sufficient strength to safely bear the sum of: the weight of the upper drive system, the weight of all suspended tray assemblies, the maximum rated weight capacity of all suspended tray assemblies, and, if manual, the force exerted by an operator operating the drive source (ie: pulling on a pull-chain). The cable winch (1) comprises essentially of a drum (1.1) rotating about a center axel (1.2), and a rope, cable, chain, belt, or any similar means (referred hereafter as “cable”) (1.3) of sufficient length to allow the suspended tray assemblies to lower to desired height. One end of the cable shall be securely attached to the chum allowing for the other end of the cable (referred hereafter as “tail”) to raise and lower as the drum winds and unwinds respectivly. The tail of the cable shall be securely attached to the lower-most suspended tray assembly. The set of cable winches (1) shall meet or exceed sufficient strength to safely bear the sum of: the weight of all suspended tray assemblies, and the maximum rated weight capacity of all suspended tray assemblies. The back-turn preventer (2) comprises essentially of a worm drive and a one-way idler shaft-collar (2.3). Whereby, a worm drive is a common gear arrangement comprising essentially of a worm screw (2.1) which meshes with a worm gear (2.2). Due to the fact that the axel of the worm screw is mounted perpendicularly with respect to the axel of the worm gear, the worm gear is essentially unable to turn when not acted on by the worm screw. By implementing a worm screw with a fine thread, and a worm gear with similar meshing thread, this affect is further increased. By driving the worm screw with the drive source (3) and driving the cable winches (1) from the worm gear, the operator may raise and/or lower the suspended tray assemblies to a desired height, then load suspended tray assemblies without any suspended tray assembly lowering while acted on only by gravity. The one-way idler shaft-collar is essentially a one-way locking bearing mounted inside a shaft-collar, allowing the input shaft to drive the output shaft in a single rotational direction, while idling when the input shaft rotates in the other direction. Said one-way idler shaft-collar is to be placed in series between the worm gear axel and the cable winch(s) axel. Use of said one-way idler shaft-collar will allow the trays to lower without beginning to raise Retractable Shelving System again if the cable winches are completely unwound and over-turned. The back-turn preventer (2) shall meet or exceed sufficient strength to safely bear the sum of: the weight of all suspended tray assemblies, and the maximum rated weight capacity of all suspended tray assemblies. The drive source (3) may essentially comprise of a gear change (3.1) and a mechanical input (3.2) comprising essentially of either but not limited to: a manual hand crank, manual pull-chain loop, a motorized drive. Said gear change may be either a step-up (of any desired ratio) to compensate for the step-down reduction of the back-turn preventer (2), or a step-down to increase the mechanical advantage of lifting heavy load. The drive source (3) shall meet or exceed sufficient strength to safely lift and lower the sum of: the weight of all suspended tray assemblies, and the maximum rated weight capacity of all suspended tray assemblies. In addition, if manual, the drive source (3) shall meet or exceed sufficient strength to safely bear the force exerted by an operator operating the drive source (ie: pulling on a pull-chain). The array of suspended tray assemblies essentially comprises of one or more suspended tray assemblies. Each suspended tray assembly, except for the lower-most suspended tray assembly, essentially comprises of a tray surface (4), typically four grapples (5), typically four descenders (6) , and typically four tethers (7); while the lower-most suspended tray assembly essentially comprises of a tray surface (4), typically four fixed cable anchors (6), and typically four tethers (7) . The tray surface (4) may essentially comprise of structural supports and a payload surface comprising of either but not limited to: a smooth surface, a raised-walled tray surface (can be useful, among other reasons, to contain accidental spills of liquid or small debris), a corrugated surface (can be useful, among other reasons, to reduce sliding friction of heavy payloads), a perforated surface or a barred/slatted surface (can be useful, among other reasons, for air-drying a payload). Each tray surface (4) shall meet or exceed sufficient strength to safely bear the sum of: the weight of its suspended tray assembly, and the maximum rated weight capacity of its suspended tray assembly. The grapple (5) comprises essentially of a latch (5.1) mounted pivotally on a pivot (5.2), a latch-pin (5.3), a spring (5.4), and a hard-stop (5.5). The latch shall be pivotally mounted to the structure of the suspended tray assembly. The spring shall be mounted and compressed to force the latch into an engaged position. A tether (7) from the suspended tray assembly below shall be anchored to the latch in such a way that when tension is applied to the tether from the suspended tray assembly below lowering fully, the latch will be forced into an open position; thus releasing the latch-pin. The latch-pin shall be securely mounted either to the upper drive system (in the case of the upper-most suspended tray assembly), or to the suspended tray assembly above (in the case of all others). When tension on the tether from the below suspended tray assembly is applied to the latch, the said suspended tray assembly is released from the above suspended tray assembly; this process shall continue as the operator continues to lower, cascading upwards until all suspended tray assemblies are suspended by their respective tethers. The hard-stop is to be placed in such a way to allow the tether to fully open the latch without the latch over-travelling; thus, the hard-stop shall bear the tension from the tether while the latch is open. While the suspended tray assemblies are being raised (retracted), each suspended tray assembly shall sequentially collide with either the upper drive system (in the case of the upper-most suspended tray assembly), or the suspended tray assembly above (in the case of all others); thus grappling Retractable Shelving System with the above. This grappling shall occur sequentially starting from the lower-most suspended tray assembly cascading upwards. The set of grapples (5) for each suspended tray assembly shall meet or exceed sufficient strength to safely bear the sum of: the weight of all suspended tray assemblies below and including itself (but not above), and the maximum rated weight capacity of all suspended tray assemblies below and including itself (but not above). The descender (6) may essentially comprise of: a cog (6.1), a pawl (6.2) mounted pivotally on a pivot (6.8), and a spring (6.3) (collectively referred to hereafter as “ratchet”), a hard-stop (6.4), a cable pulley and/or sprocket (referred to hereafter as “cable pulley”) (6.5), and an axel (6.6). Alternatively, the descender may essentially comprise of a ratchet (6.1-6.3), a hard-stop (6.4), a one-way idler shaft-collar (6.7), and a cable pulley (6.5); the addition of the one-way idler shaft-collar in series between the cable pulley and the ratchet allows for the same performance while eliminating the undesired sound of the ratchet clicking as the suspended tray assemblies lower. The spring shall be mounted and compressed to force the pawl into an engaged position with the cog. While the cable winch is lowering, the descender (6) of one or more suspended tray assemblies allows the cable from the cable winch to lower suspended tray assemblies below, while said suspended tray assembly remains grappled above. The descender (6) also allows said suspended tray assembly to grasp the cable from the cable winch, allowing said suspended tray assembly to lower at the rate of the cable while no-longer grappling above. While the cable winch is raising, the descenders (6) of all upper suspended tray assemblies still supported by their respective tethers allow the cable from the cable winch to slip through, allowing below suspended tray assemblies to raise while said suspended tray assembly remains at a fixed height until below suspended tray assemblies grapple to it; this sequence will cascade upwards until all suspended tray assemblies are fully retracted and grappled. To achieve said “slip through” while raising requires the descender to unlock its grasp on the cable; it does this when tension is applied to the respective tethers above. The hard-stop is to be placed in such a way to allow the tethers to fully disengage the pawl of the ratchet without the pawl over-travelling; thus, the hard-stop shall bear the tension from the tethers while the pawl is disengaged. Ideally, the set of descenders (6) for each suspended tray assembly shall meet or exceed sufficient strength to safely bear the sum of: the weight of all suspended tray assemblies below and including itself (but not above), and the maximum rated weight capacity of all suspended tray assemblies below and including itself (but not above). However, if the grapples or descenders are prone to any amount of backlash or settling, then the set of descenders (6) for each suspended tray assembly shall meet or exceed sufficient strength to safely bear the sum of: the weight of all suspended tray assemblies, and the maximum rated weight capacity of all suspended tray assemblies. The tether (7) may essentially comprise of either but not limited to a rope, a belt, a cable, or a rigid bar hinged in the middle and at either end. The tethers play a key role in the timing of when each lowering suspended tray assembly un-grapples and begins its descent. The tethers length can determine individual shelf vertical spacing, including the top tray spacing from the upper drive as well as spacing between each tray. The sum of all tether lengths can exceed the vertical height of the room because the lower trays will expand first then stack on the floor if needed. Tension is applied to the tethers when a below suspended tray assembly is lowered below a grappled suspended tray assembly by the length of the tethers. The upper end of the tethers for the upper-most suspended tray assembly shall be securely anchored to the upper drive system. The upper end of the remaining tethers shall be securely anchored to the latch (5.1) of the grapple (5) of the suspended tray assembly above. The lower end of the tethers the of the lower-most suspended Retractable Shelving System tray assembly shall be securely anchored to the lower-most suspended tray assembly. The lower end of the remaining tethers shall be securely anchored to the pawl (6.2) of the descender (6) of the suspended tray assembly below. Elastic bands can manage loose tethers by pulling inwards when tension is alleviated. The set of tethers (7) for each suspended tray assembly shall meet or exceed sufficient strength to safely bear the sum of: the weight of all suspended tray assemblies below and including itself (but not above), and the maximum rated weight capacity of all suspended tray assemblies below and including itself (but not above).
