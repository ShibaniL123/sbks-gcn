FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention is related to a process for the preparation ospemifene and to intermediate compounds used in the process. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ospemifene or (Z)-2-[4-(4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-but-1-enyl)phenoxy]ethanol is represented by formula (I): Ospemifene is an estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist currently investigated e.g. for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause. Preparation of ospemifene starting from Z-4-(4-hydroxy-1,2-diphenyl-but-1-enyl)phenol has been described in WO 96/07402. Use of McMurry coupling reaction for the manufacture of ospemifene has been described in WO 2008/099059 and WO 2011/089385. These methods suffer from the drawback that large amounts of expensive reagents or solvents, such as titanium tetrachloride, LiAlH4, and 2-Me-THF, are needed: Thus, it is desirable to provide an improved method for producing ospemifene in high yield and purity the method also being economically feasible and suitable for use in a large scale. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) which process comprises (a) reacting a compound of formula (III) wherein R is a protecting group tolerant to Grignard or other organometallic reagents, with phenylmagnesium halide to produce a compound of formula (IV) wherein R is as defined above, and (b) treating the compound of formula (IV) with hydrochloric acid to produce a compound of formula (V) wherein R is as defined above, and (c) cleaving the ester bond of a compound of formula (V) wherein R is as defined above, to give a compound of formula (I). In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) comprising, the step of treating the compound of formula (IV), wherein R is a protecting group tolerant to Grignard or other organometallic reagents, with hydrochloric acid to produce a compound of formula (V), and cleaving the ester bond of a compound of formula (V) to give a compound of formula (I). The invention is also directed to novel compounds of formula (III) and (IV) wherein R is t-butyl, adamantyl or 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The term “lower alcohol” means C1-5 alcohol, preferably C1-4 alcohol. Representative examples include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and butanol, particularly preferred is methanol and ethanol. In accordance with the present invention the compound of formula (III) wherein R is a protecting group tolerant to Grignard or other organometallic reagents, is reacted with phenylmagnesium halide to produce a compound of formula (IV) wherein R is as defined above. The above reaction is based on the nucleophilic addition of a phenylmagnesium halide (Grignard reagent), such as phenylmagnesium chloride or phenylmagnesium bromide, to the carbonyl group of the compound of formula (III). The reaction is carried out in suitable solvent, such as diethyl ether or THF, under nitrogen atmosphere. The reagents are suitably added at room temperature and the mixture is heated, for example to about 60° C. The reaction is typically completed within about 2-3 hours. The reaction can be quenched e.g. with addition of saturated NH4Cl-solution. Phenylmagnesium halide reagent is at typically used in molar excess, e.g. in 1.5-2 molar equivalents per compound of formula (III). The resulting compound of formula (IV) can be isolated, if desired, by evaporation of the solvents and subsequent crystallization or the crude compound can be forwarded directly to the next step. In the next step the compound of formula (IV) is subjected to dehydration and ring-opening reaction by treating it with hydrochloric acid to produce the ester compound of formula (V). Thus, the compound of formula (IV) is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM) or toluene and this solution is added slowly to aqueous HCl solution, such as 30% HCl solution. The reaction is suitably carried out at room temperature. The reaction is typically completed within less than one hour. The resulting ester of formula (V) is particularly suitable for being isolated and purified by crystallization before its use in the next reaction step. Thus, after completion of the ring opening reaction the reaction mixture can be poured on saturated NaHCO3 solution and the organic phase is recovered. The organic phase is preferably evaporated and the crystallization solvent is added. Suitable crystallization solvents include plain lower alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol. Particularly suitable crystallization, solvents are methanol or ethanol essentially in the absence of water, thereby giving the ester of formula (V) in high yield and purity. The mixture of crystallization solvent and crude ester of formula (V) is stirred and suitably heated to achieve dissolution. The mixture may then be cooled to about 40° C. and seeded with the desired Z-isomer. Cooling is continued over a period of time (preferably slowly, e.g. over more than one hour) to room temperature or below, e.g. below 15° C., in order to achieve crystallization. The mixture is suitably stirred in this temperature for more than 3 hours, e.g. for 12 hours. The crystalline ester of formula (V) is filtered, washed and dried preferably under reduced pressure. The chemical purity of the crystallized compound of formula (V) is at this stage typically higher than 92% and the amount of E-isomer less than 5%. The end product may be further recrystallized if desired. Compounds of formula (III) can be prepared using the methods known in the art. For example, compound of formula (III) can be suitably prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II) with a compound of formula X1—CH2—CH2—X2, wherein X1 and X2 is a leaving group and R is a protecting group tolerant to Grignard or other organometallic reagents. Suitable leaving groups X1 and X2 include, but are not limited to, halogens, para-toluenesulfonate (CH3C6H4SO2O—), methanesulfonate (CH3SO2O—) and trifluoromethanesulfonate (CF3SO2O—) groups. According to one embodiment of the invention X1 and X2 are halogens, in particular X1 is Br and X2 is Cl. The reaction between the compound of formula (II) and the compound of formula X1—CH2—CH2—X2 is suitably carried out in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst (PTC), such as quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts. Examples of phase transfer catalyst include tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulfate (TBAHS), benzyltrimethylammonium chloride and hexadecyltributylphosphonium bromide. Thus, compound of formula (II) is dissolved in suitable solvent such as toluene under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature followed by the addition of phase transfer catalyst such as TBAHS and aqueous NaOH solution (e.g. 50% NaOH solution) to the reaction mixture. The resulting two-phase system is stirred vigorously and the compound of formula X1—CH2—CH2—X2 is added dropwise. The reaction is typically completed within 12 hours. The organic phase is isolated, washed, filtered, dried and evaporated to obtain the compound of formula (III). Alternatively, the reaction between the compound of formula (II) and the compound of formula X1—CH2—CH2—X2 can be carried out in an organic solvent, such as DMSO, DMF or THF, in the presence of a base such as NaH, K-, Na- or LiOBu-t, or corresponding carbonates. Compounds of formula (II) can be prepared using the methods known in the art. For example, compound of formula (II) can be suitably prepared by reacting a compound of formula (VI) wherein R is C1-5 alkyl or an optionally substituted phenyl, with 2-phenylacetic acid. Typically, the reaction is catalyzed by a Brønsted acid, such as polyphosphoric acid (PPA). Thus, to warmed PPA is added compound of formula (VI) and 2-phenylacetic acid. After stirring for about 3 h, water is added and the mixture, is stirred further, at room temperature for about 2 h. The precipitated compound of formula (II) is filtered, washed and dried, and, if desired, recrystallised from suitable solvent, such as hexane/isopropanol (1:1). According to one embodiment of the invention, particularly suitable compounds of formula (II), (III), (IV), (V) and (VI) are those wherein R is t-butyl, adamantyl or 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl. Particularly preferred compounds of formula (II), (III), (IV), (V) and (VI) are those wherein R is t-butyl. The compound of formula (I) (ospemifene) is obtained by subjecting the compound of formula (V) to cleavage of the ester bond (dashed bond below) of the compound of formula (V) such that the hydroxyl group of ospemifene is formed. The cleavage of the ester bond of the compound of formula (V) can be carried out by using well known methods such hydrolysis or a reductive cleavage. Hydrolysis of the ester bond of the compound of formula (V) can be catalysed by a base or acid. A base catalysed hydrolysis is particularly preferred. The base catalysed hydrolysis can be carried in a suitable solvent such as aqueous THF or aqueous THF/MeOH mixture in the presence of a suitable base, such as NaOH or LiOH at room temperature for a time sufficient to complete the hydrolysis. When the hydrolysis is carried out at room temperature, the reaction is completed typically within 12 hours or less. Thereafter, water and suitable organic solvent such as EtOAc is added and the organic phase is washed, dried, filtered and concentrated. Ospemifene can be conveniently isolated from the residue by crystallization from a suitable crystallization solvent. Preferred solvents for crystallization are C1-5 alcohols, particularly methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, or aqueous. C1-5 alcohols such as aqueous methanol (e.g. 80% or 90% methanol). Reductive cleavage of the ester bond of the compound of formula (V) to obtain ospemifene can be carried out in the presence of a reducing agent such as lithium aluminium hydride in a suitable organic solvent such as toluene, THF, hexane or xylene or mixture thereof. The reaction is suitably carried out at room temperature and under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction may be suitably quenched by addition of saturated NH4Cl-solution. Organic phase is washed, dried, filtered and concentrated.
