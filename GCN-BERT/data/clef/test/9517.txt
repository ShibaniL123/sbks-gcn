3-(4-(Benzofuran-2-yl)butyl)-1-methylpyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione
Step 1
3-(4-(Benzofuran-2-yl)butyl)-1-methylpyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione
1-Methylpyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione (50.0 mg, 0.281 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (4 mL). 2-(4-Chlorobutyl)benzofuran (64.0 mg, 0.308 mmol), potassium iodide (56.0 mg, 0.337 mmol) and potassium carbonate (78.0 mg, 0.561 mmol) were added at 25°C and the reaction was heated to 120°C, stirred for 16 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by preparative HPLC to give 3-(4-(benzofuran-2-yl)butyl)-1-methylpyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione (53.0 mg) with a yield of 54%.
