FIELD OF INVENTION The invention concerns detergent formulations with dyes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION WO2011/011799 (Procter and Gamble) discloses violet thiophene dyes containing a anionic group covalently bound to alkoxy groups for use in laundry detergents for whitening textiles. To obtain other aesthetic colours in the detergent, violet anionic thiophene dyes are mixed with additional dyes. Colour brightness is a key attribute of colour that the consumer desires. Consumers do not like dull colours. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have found that mixtures of violet thiophene dyes and blue triphenyl methane dyes become brighter blue on exposure to sunlight.

EXPERIMENTAL Example 1 Detergent solutions were created containing 7.28 wt % anionic surfactant and 7.28 wt % non-ionic surfactant. The anionic surfactant was linear alkyl benzene sulfonate. The non-ionic was a from primary alkyl ethoxylate with a primary C12-C15 alkyl group and 7 moles of ethoxylate per 1 mole of alkyl group. The anionic thiophene dye (0.001 wt %): was added to the formulations, such that the optical density (1 cm) at the maximum absorption in the range 400-700 nm was ˜1. The solution was violet in colour. The sample was split into 4 aliquots, blue dyes added at a level, such that if added to detergent solution alone without the violet dye they would have an optical density at the max of ˜1. The UV-VIS spectra of the formulations were measure in a 1 cm plastic cuvette. The solutions were blue in colour. The value of the optical density at the maximum absorption of the detergent in the visible (400-700 nm) was measured, OD(max) and also the value at 450 nm, OD(450). OD(max) is a measure of the desired colour and OD(450) a measure of the undesired (dulling colour). The fraction Brightness=OD(max)/OD(450) provides a measure of the brightness of the solution, the larger the fraction the brighter the solution. The formulations in the plastic cuvettes were irradiated in a weatherometer for 30 minutes with simulated sunlight (385 W/m2 300-800 nm). The UV-VIS spectra were then recorded again. The change in brightness was calculated according to the following formula: [in-line-formulae]Brightness=Brightness (final)−Brightness (initial)[/in-line-formulae] A positive value indicates an increase in Brightness. The experiments were repeated four times and the results summarised in the table below: Blue dye 95% confidence chromophore Blue dye • Brightness limits Azo (reference) Acid Blue 29 −0.87 0.20 Anthraquinone Acid Blue 80 0.22 0.39 (reference) Phenazine Acid Blue 59 0.33 0.19 (reference) Triphenylmethane Acid Blue 1 3.32 0.28 The mixture of violet anionic thiophene dye and blue triphenylmethane dye increases the brightness of the detergent solution on irradiation. Example 2 Photostability of the Blue Dyes Detergent solutions were created containing 7.28 wt % anionic surfactant and 7.28 wt % non-ionic surfactant. The anionic surfactant was linear alkyl benzene sulfonate. The non-ionic was a primary alkyl ethoxylate with a primary C12-C15 alkyl group and 7 moles of ethoxylate per 1 mole of alkyl group. Blue dye was added at level such that the optical density (1 cm) at the maximum absorption of the blue dye was ˜1. The UV-VIS spectra of the formulations were measure in a 1 cm plastic cuvette. The solutions were blue in colour. The value of the optical density at the maximum absorption of the detergent in the visible (400-700 nm) was measured, OD (max). The formulations in the plastic cuvettes were irradiated in a weatherometer for 30 minutes with simulated sunlight (385 W/m2 300-800 nm). The UV-VIS spectra were then recorded again. The percentage of blue dye lost (% dye lost) due to photoirradation was calculated using the equation: [in-line-formulae]% dye lost=100×(1−OD(after irradiation)/OD(before irradiation))[/in-line-formulae] The experiment was repeated four times for each of the blue dyes of example 1. The results are given in the table below.

Photostability increases in the order Acid Blue 1 (lowest); Acid Blue 29; Acid Blue 59; Acid Blue80 (highest). On irradiation the brightness increase in the order Acid Blue 1 (best); Acid Blue 59; Acid Blue 80; Acid Blue 29 (worst) 1.
