This invention relates to air connections for electromagnetieally actuated ralves such as are employed for example in electro-pneumatically operated switches, controllers and similar devices. The object of tbe invention is to construct an improved air connection which may be very readily applied to the casing of an electromagnetically operated valve for the purpose of admitting air into said casing from a common source of supply pipe for a number of similar valves, said connect!on being so formed tbat any individual valve can be disconnected from and connected to tbe air supply pipe without interfering witb tbe connections of the otber valves to the same common supply and without the necessity of breaking or making an inconvenient number of joints. â€¢ "* ccordiag to the invention the improved air connecton is in the form of a ring having a pipe secured thereto so as to communicate with the interior orific tbereof. Tbe ring is adapted to be attached to tbe casing of the valve by a beaded plug which screws into said casing and passes very loosely througb the ring so that an annular channel is formed between the plug add tbe ring. The plug is further provided with a passage or passages by which the annular channel, above referred to, is brought into communication with the interior of the vale casing. Suitable packing wasbers may be provided between tbe ring and the valve casing and the bead of tbe plug respectively, so that when the plug is screwed firmly in place, air tight joints will he formed. The plug may take the place of that commonly employed with similar valve casings for enabling inspection or adjustment of the valve to be made. Wbere a common air supply is to be connected with a number of valve casings each sucb casing will be provided witb a ring as above described, and said rings may be connected either in series with an air pipe passing from one ring to the next or the rings may conveniently be connected in pairs. In wbich latter case eacb valve casing may be provided with two rings arranged approximately concentrically and secured to the valve casing by a single plug, one of said rings being connected by a pipe to the corresponding prlee: ONE RUPEE. ring of the adjacent valve casing on one said, and the second ring being connected by a pipe to the corresponding ring secured to the valve casing on the other side. In order that the invention may be clearly nnderstcod it will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 a sectional side elevation of an electro,nagnetically controlled pneumatic piston el a eontactor switch unit with the air connection according to the invention applied thereto. Figures 2 and 3 are respectively a plan and a sectional side elevation of one form of the i.,rJproved air connection, Figure is a front elevation of the lower parts of two eontactor switeh umts mounted upon a framework nd having one fo,'m of the improved air connections applied thereto. Figure 5 is a sectional ele:,ation of a modified form of the air connection shown in Figurers 1 to 4; Figures 6 and 7 a e a perspective view and a sectional elevation respectively of a further form of the air connection and Figures 8 arid 9 are respectively a plan and a sectional elevation of a still further form of the air connection according the invention. Referring to Figure 1, the electro-pneumatic device therein illustrated comprises a piston cod 1 guided in a tubular guide portion 2 which is a part of" a hollow casting 3. Tie piston od 1 has a )ist m 4 a d suitable pistonpacking 5 secured thereto by means of a threaded extension 6 which a part of the piston rod 1 and also by washers 7 and a nut, S. A spring or resilient member 9 is positioned upon the tubular guide portion 2 and urges the piston to its lower position. The piston is actuated in an upward .direction by means of compressed air or other suitable fluid under pressure, which is admitted and exhausted from a passage 10 to a chamber 11 that is situated below the piston 4. The admission of air t,o the passage 10 from an inlet cha 1 nber 12 is controlled by an inlet and exhaust valve member 13 which is operated by a stem mender The inlet chamber 12 of each of the contactor switches is provided in the usual manner with one or more inlet openings, which will be hereinafter described in detail, for admitting the compressed air or other fluid, said chambers 12 of the several switches being pneumatically connected in series relation by suitable pipes or conveyors, one of which is connected to a suitable source of guid pressure. The valve member 13 is maintained in its upper or closed position by .a resilient member 15 and b z a plug nut 16 the form of which will be hebeinafter described. An exhaust port 17 is provided for permitting the air to discharge from the chamber ll when the valve member 13 is in its upper or closed position. The valve stem 14 is movably disposed within a hollow magnetizable core member 18 which is located within a laterally projecting portion 19 forming part of or attached to the casting 3. The core melnber 18 carries a solenoid coil 20 a ld is adapted when said ceil is energized to attract an armature member 21 which actuates the valve stem 14 and is loosely mounted thereon and upon a projecting portion 22 which forms a part of the hollow casting 3. The electromagnetic device is covered by encasing members 23 and 24 according to usual pracotiee. A headed pin 25 extends tbrongh the encasing member 23 and serves to actuate the armature 21 and the valve stem 14 when it is desired manually to operate the valve member 13. Several of such units, for example, eontactor switch units may be mounted side by side on a supl)orting framework one member of which is indicated at the other member (not shown) being usually at a higher level and supporting the upper part of said units (also not shown). P lrts of t o of said units are indicated in Figure 4 whereto 27 are the arc chutes or boxes which are usually provided on contactor switch units as will be well understood by those skilled in the art. It will be further understood that the devices far described are given by way of exanlph ollly and that the invention not only applicable to electro- )neu rJ tiea]ly operated connector switch units but is equally applicable to other electro-pneun atlcally o operated devices such for example as reverser switches, switch grouses operated by means of cams, drum controflers and the like. The air connection according to the invention is indicated in all the figures by the reference number 28 and the connecting pipes are indicated by the reference nuiuber 29. Referring to the form of air connection illustrated in Figures 1 to 4 inclusive, the ring portion ')8 of the air connection is attached to the valve casing beneath the chamber 12 by means of the plug nut 16 which screws into the said easing and serves also as an inspection plug and an abutment fur the resilient member 15. That part of the plug nut 1 which is surrounded by a ring portion 28 of tile air connection is of smaller dianleter than th internal diameter of said ring portion so that an annular space 30 is provided. '.('he plug nut 16 is provident with an axial bore 31 and with a te'ansverse here 3'2 coin nunicating therewith so that the annular space 30 is in communication with the inlet chamber 12. Suitable packing washers 33 n)ay be interposed between the ring portion 28 and respectively the valve casing 19 and the bead of the plug nut 16 as clearly shewn in Figure 1. The co1 - necting pipes 29 are secured laterally to the ring portions 2S of the air connections and communicate with the interior bores of the latter. The said pipes 29 may be secured to the said ring portions in any convenient manner such for example by screw threaded engagement or by brazed or silver soldered joints or otherwise, With the above described'arrangement of the air connection it is merely necessary in order to connect an air pipe to a contactor switch or other electro-pneumatically controlled device lo pass the end of the plug nut 16 through a ring 28 together with the washers 33 and then to engage said plug mtt with the alxe casing 19. In the case where the common air supply is lo be connected with a number of valve casings each of said casing will be provided with an air connecting ring 28 as above described and said rings may be connected thereto either hi series by a plurality of air pipes passing from one ring. to the next, that is, with the exception of the last ring of a series, each ring will have attached thereto the ends of two air pipes. Alternately the said rir* q may be connected together by a single pipe in pairs as screws in Figures 2,3 and 4. Referring especially to Figure 4 the left hand contactor switch unit may be the lsst of a p]urMity of such units pneumatically connected together in series, said contactor switch units having therefore only one air connecting ring '28 which is connected by the pipe 29 with the upper ring attached to file valve chamber of the right hand contactor unit the said second *Mve casing as well as the others in the series (not shown) each having two rings .-rranged approximately coaxially one above the other as clearly shewn ixI Figure 4. Thus the lower ring 28 is siuiilarly connected by an air pipe 29 wit the lower ring of the next contaetor switch imit in the series and the upper ring of said next contactor switch being connected with the upper ring of still another contactor switch and so on. The air connection 28 illustrated in Figures 1 to 4 comprises a section of pipe the axial lenetb or tbickness of which is rather greater than the p!pe 29 which is connected thereto. Instead of such an arrangement the ring ay he rode of less axial length than the diameter of the pipe 29 and gay be provided as shewn m Figure 5 lth one or more lateral lugs B4 having the pipes 29 secured therein and provided with bores 35 placing the pipes 29 in communication with the interior orific of the rings. Instead of the rings 28 and pipes 29 being constructed separately and subsequently connected together the said rings and pipes may eonve aien ly be formed in olxe piece as shown in Figures 6 and 7, by an extrusion or any other well known process. A still further modification consists in making the rings and connecting pipes integrally from a solid bar of metal such as illustrated in Figures 8 and 9. Such an arrungem nt is especially suitable for connecting together a plurality of valve easing which are mounted in line. Yhe bar 36 which is of flat rectangular sectmn is provided at internal with holes 28 x,bkh correspond as will be understood with the interior orifices of the ring 23 in Figures 1 to 7 inclusive. In addition a hole 29 is drilled throughout the length of the bar 36 so as to place said holes 28 in coxmnnnication with o e another. The bole 99 in the bar 86 may be connected with the compressed air supply or elsewhere by a pipe 37 secured to the end. If desired the parts of the bar between the holes 28 therein may be of reduced width as indicated by the dotted lines 38 at the right haadside of Figure 8. It will be appreciated that other contactor switches or devices tban those arranged in line may be connected to the bar 36 and may derive compressed air therefrom tbough a lateral T-connection to the said bar 36, said lateral connection either communicating with one of the ring holes 28 or witb the longitudinal hole 29. The bar 36 is preferably formed of a metal or alloy which is comparatively soft so that it may be bent or deformed somewhat to take care of want of alignment of the various valve casings 19. With the air connections according to the invention by reason of the difference of diameter between the connecting plug nuts 16 and the ring portions 28 these members may be permitted to occupy respective positions which are not truly coaxial which is a considerable advantage since it has heretofore been necessary to align the various contactor switches or other devices with great care. It has also been a common practice to connect the air pipes independentl,/ of the inspection and valve spring retaining plug 16 so that with the improved arrangement the construction may be cheapened. It will also be appreciated that the air connection of one valve of a series may be removed without appreciably disturbing the air connections of adjacent valves. Furthermore, a complete contactor switch unit or other device may be removed witbout disturbing other devices or their air connections. A still further advantage is that the improved air connections may he of standard construction and manufactured in large quantities, the length of the connecting pipes 29 being also standard so that to permit such standard air connections to be used for devices which are separated from one another by different amounts the said pipes 29 may be bent so that the rings are the required distance apart. Although in the arrangements herein described the ring connections 28 have been disposed with their axes vertical, it will be understood that the invention is in no way limited to such an arrangement. For example, referring to Figure 1, the plug nut 16 could be arranged on a horizontal axis on the left hand end of the valve chamber 19 or elsewhere. 1.
