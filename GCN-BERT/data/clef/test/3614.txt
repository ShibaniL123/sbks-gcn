Applicant(s) Name, Nationality & Address SAINT-GOBAIN GLASS FRANCE 18, Avenue D'alsace, F9240{) Courbevoie, FRANCE, a French company 3. Preamble to the Description l t t x rtc tr'*' t A t. 1 11 1UIIU%VilI I3 k IJI ILIUJi U i k,l IL/K; tll 7 111% 1[Llk/IT lE I\LI V IOlkJJN!AJ COMPLETE : The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed INSULATING GLAZING UNIT, ESPECIALLY FOR AN OPENING LEAF OF A REFRIGERATED ENCLOSURE The invention relates to an insulating g!azinq unil_ intended for the openin 9 leaf of a refr]gerated enclosure in which cold or deep-frozen p oduc[_s ale displayed, such as food or drinks, or any other product requiring to be kept cold, for example pharmaceutical products or even flowers. The insulating glazing unit consists of at least two glass substrates separated by a gas layer and provided on at least one of them with a low-E (low-emissivity) coating. When products preserved in a refrigerated enclosure have to remain visible, as is the case in many current commercial premises, the refrigerated enclosure is equipped with glazed parts that convert it into a refrigerated "display case", the usual name for which "refrigerated sales cabinet". There are severa] alternative forms of these "display cases". Some of them are in the form of a cabinet, and then :it is the door itself that is transparent, while others are Jn the form of chests, and it is the horizontal lid that glazed in order to allow the contents to be seen. In these types of display cases, it is necessary for the merchandise to remain perfectly visible to customers so that they can preselect the merchandise without opening the "display case". However, one of the main problems encountered in these display cases is the formation of fogging on the external face of the opening leaf, on the side facing the shop or store. This is because this external Lace cooled by the refrlqerated environment lying on the opposite side, the internal face side in contact with the internal environment of the enclosure, while being in contact with the surrounding atmosphere of the shop or store, which has a higher humidity and is at a much higher temperature : when the temperature of this external surface is at a temperature below the dew point, fogging occurs. This makes it difficult to see the merchandise. Another major problem is also the formation of fogging, or even of frosting, on the internal :[ace of the opening leaf when the display case is opened in order to take out the merchandise. This is because the surface of the inner glass substrate, which has to be at a very low temperature, indeed below 0°C, then comes into contact with the ambient atmosphere, which is of much higher humidity and at a much higher temperature. The temperature of the inner substrate is then below the temperature of the dew point, and this results in the phenomenon of condensation on the substrate, or even of frosting when the temperature of this substrate is negative. The presence of fogging or frosting makes Jt difficult to see the merchandise, and it is several minutes, or even tens of minutes, before the fogging or frosting completely disappears. To alleviate these drawbacks, insulating glazing units in the prior art have been designed to have greater thermal insulation, namely double-glazing or triple-glazing units provided with one or more low-E coatings, and the substrate of which, in contact with the inside of the enclosure, is heated. Also known, from patent application WO 03/008877, is a glazing unit of increased thermal insulation for a refrigerated enclosure which, according to said document, ensures that fogging disappears on the external face of the opening leaf, on the side facing the shop or store. This type of insulating glazing unit consists of a triple glazing unit comprising three glass substrates 3 mm in thickness, spaced apart by gas layers o[ equal thickness, 8 or 13 ram, and consisting of air, argon or krypton, two low-E coatings being placed on faces 2 and of the gIa×i_ng unit (counting from the outermost face of the glazing in the closed p()sJ ti or: on the enclosure) . According to that document, the glazing unit has a heat transfer coefficient U rlot exceeding 0.2 I<]'U!h/r-.sq.f:L.],' or i.ii W!m 2.K. It will be recalled that ] W/m 2. 1< corresponds to 0.]8 BTU/hr.sq.ft.F. The improvement in heat transfer coefficient U ensures, with the opening leaf in the closed position, that the outer surface is relatively warm compared with the temperature that it has because of the cold environment existing on its opposite side. This outer surface, on the shop or store side, is thus at a tempeEaLur, c above. the dew point, preventing the formation of fogging on this outer surface when the display case is closed, but requiring no heating element on the outer substrate. However, although the drawback of fogging on the shop or store side has been solved, the drawback of frosting, on the enclosure side, remains latent. This because such a glazing unit requires a certdin delay, even a few minutes, before the frosting on the inner surface of the glazing unit has disappeared. Furthermore, owing to the fact that the heat transpire coefficient U is higher, the outer surface of the internal substrate in contact with the refrigerated environment will be even colder, thereby encouraging even more frosting <o form on the substrate when the display case is opened and requiring a longer time before it disappears. To solve th]s second drawback to prevent orto rapidly eliminate the fogg ng or frosting [.hat has formed on the internal face of the glazing unit in contact with the inside of the enc!osure - it is also known to provide, as a]. Ready men t) oned, hea ng elements placed on this internal face o[ Lhe g}a×ing uni t. However:, the electricity consumed by such refrigerated display cases, especially ()wing to the heating elements deposited on the substrates, goes counter t_o energy saving - the very present preoccupati on i n du cab e development and environmental protec L:i on - and represents higher costs for the stores. Moreover, the various functional layers used, Jnclud:ing the ]ow-E coatings, are known to degrade the ] Jght transmission of the glazing units. To ensure that the merchandise is correctly visible from outside the enclosure, stores do not hesitate in fitting the inside of the enclosures with lighting which, apart from the additional energy expended, necessarily generates heat that may degrade the quality of the frozen products on disp]ay and the corresponding refrJ ge atc< u i L -.J[ COnsume more energy. The object of the invention is therefore to provide an optimum solution for an insulating glazing unit with an enhanced thermal property intended to be used for a refrigerated display case, which solution avoids the formation of fogging or frosting, even under dif:[:[cL It conditions as regards the external and internal envir0nmerlts of the display case, the frequency with which it is opened, for taking merchandise out of the display case or for restocking it, and which efficient in terms of energy-saving and ensures that the products displayed in said display case are o[ high quality and can be easily seen. In the rest of the description, it is to be understood that "inner" and "outer" are terms referring elements that are turned toward the inside and the outside, respectively, of the refrigerated enclosure when the opening leaf is in the closed position. "Internal" and "external" are understood to mean terms for elements that are turned toward The J i 1 sJ de an(-] the outside, respectively, of the insulating glazing urli[ . According to the invention, the insulating glazing unit J ntended J n particu]ar for an opening ]ea [ of a refrigerated enclosure comprises at ] east two glass substrates, at least one spacer of low thermal conductivity which keeps the two substrates spaced apart, and a low-E (low-emissivity) coat i.ng that deposited at least partly on at least one of the substrates, characterized in that: - the spacer has a thermal conductiviLy of less than 1 Wim.

According to a first embodiment of the invention, the insulating glazing unit is a triple glazing unit comprising three glass substrates, namely a first substrate, the external face of which is intended to be in contact with the inside of the enclosure with the opening leaf in its closed position, a second substrate or intermediate substrate, and a third substrate, the external face of which is intended to be in contact with the external environment of the enclosure, these substrates being separated from one another by the spacer of low thermal conductivity: - the thickness of the substrates being between 2 and 5 mm, preferably being equal to 3 or 4 mm; - at ].east one of the airspaces between the substrates being filled with at least one rare gas; - the thickness of the gas layers being at least 4 mm; - a ]ow-E coating being deposited on face 2 and/or face 4 of the glazing unit; - the anti-frost coating being deposited on a least part Of the external face of the third substrate; - the glazing unit having a thermal conducLivJty coefficient U of less than ] 1 W/m2.K, or even less than 0.95 or 0.80 W/m 2.K, with a gas filling of at least 85%; and - the glazing unit having a light transmission 0 at least 67% and an external light reflection of less than 18%. According to one feature, the triple glazing unft includes a ]ow-E coating on thermal transfer coeffJcffent faces 2 and 4, and has a U of less than 1.0 W!mZ.K. Advantageously, the low-E coating Js deposited on Lhau face of the glazing unit which is associated with the thicker gas layer. Preferably, at least one antirefiectLon coating ]s deposited on one of the faces of the glazing unit, preferably on at least one of faces I, 3 and According to a variant of this embodiment, one of the gas layers has a thickness of 8 mm, whereas the other gas layer has a thickness of at least ]0 mm, the gas layers being argon. According to another variant of this embodiment, one of the gas layers is krypton and has a thickness of 8 m whereas the other gas layer is air and has a thickness of at least i0 ram. According to a second embodiment of the invention, the insulating g]azing unit is a double glazing uni t comprising two glass substrates, namely a fir_st substrate, the external face of which is intended to be in contact with the inside of the enc]osure when the opening leaf is in its closed position, and a second substrate, the external face of which is intended to be in contact with the external environment of the enclosure, these being separated by the spacer of Low thermal conductivity, the airspace between the substrates being filled with a rare gas" - the thickness of the substrates being equal to 3 or 4 mm; - the airspace between the substrates being filled with at ]_east one rare gas; - the thickness of the gas layer being at least 8 mm; - a low-E coating being deposited at least on face 2 of the glazing unit; - the anti-frost coating being deposited on at ].east part of the external face of the first substrate; - the glazing unit having a thermal conductivity ty coefficient_ U of less than 1.15 W/m2.K with a gas filling of at least 85%; and - the glazing unit having a light transmission o[ at ]east 7b% and an external light reflection of less than 12%. According to one feature, another low-E coating Js deposited on face 3 of the glazing unit according to this second embodiment. Preferably, it has a thermal conductivity coefficient U of less than 1.05 W/m2.K with a gas filling of at least 92%. According to a varJ ant of thJ s embod J ment, the gas layer is krypton. According to another variant of this embodiment, the gas layer is xenon with a thickness of 8 mm. Advantageously, the double glazing unit includes, on face I and/or face 3, an antireflection coating and has a light transmission of more than 80% and an externa] light reflection of less than 10%. According to another feature of the insulating glazing unit of the invention, the anti-frost coating is such that, when the glazing unit provided with the anti-frost coating is brought into contact, on the side of the coating, with a temperature environment falling to at most -30°C, in particular -15°C, -]8°C or -24°C, and then brought into contact with an atmosphere at a temperature Of at least 0°, preferably between i0° and 35°, especially between 15° and 30° and in particu]ar between 23° and 27°C and having a resJdua] humidity of at ]east 25%, no frost formed for at least ]2 s, preferably at ]east ] minute, :in parkJcular al ]cast 2 minutes, or even as long as at ].east 3 minutes. This anti-frost coating includes an antifreeze compound that ]owers the crystallization temperature, such as a salt, especially KCI, NaCl or equivalent in soltltion, and!or an alcohol, and!or a suitable hydrophJl] J.c polymer, copolymer, prepolymer or o]]gomer, opt:ional]y in water, and optionally one or more surfaotants, this compound optionally having a hydrophobic character on part of its surface. Advantageously, the antifreeze compound is combined with at least one other compound so as to obtain a physical or chemical interaction that mechanically reinforces the coating. This antifreeze is, for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone, this being combined with d polyurethane so as to create a physical interaction, or it may be a po]yo], this being combined with a< leas[ one isocvanai_e functional group so as o create a chemical interaction. According to another feature o the insulating glazing unit, the spacer placed between the substrates comprises, in one embodiment, a first sealing barrier consisting of a body made of a thermoplastic, of the styrene acrylonitri].e (SAN, or polypropylene type, said thermoplastic being blended with reinforcement fibers, of the glass zype, and of a metal foJ], of the aluminum or stainless steel uype, which part] y covers the thermoplastic, and also a second sealing barrier, which seals agalnsr liquids and vapor, of the p0]ysuifide type. According Eo another embodiment of the spacer, this consists, over an ]eas< part of the De r )hery o[ tile qlazinq unit, of a substantially fiat strip that is fastened to the edges of Lhe substrates and is made o[ stainless st:eel, aluminum or plast.;ic r-ei.'iforced wi th reinforcement fibers, and comprising, on that face on the opposite side from the gas layer, a me<<al coating constituting a barrier that seals against vapor, gases and liquids. In addition, the spacer has a ] i near buckling strength of at least 400 N/re. Preferably, at ]east the outer substrates o ; [:he insulating glazing unit of the invention are made of toughened glass. Such an insulating glazing unit characterized above is advantageously used as an opening leaf, in particular for a refrigerated enclosure. When the opening leaf includes, for supporting the glazing unit, a frame formed from aluminum and having a therma! bridge break, it advantageously has an overaJi. heat transfer coefficient Uw of less than ].25 W/m2.N for a gas filling of at least 92%. When the opening leaf includes a frame formed from PVC, it has an overall heat transfer coefficient Uw of less than 1.20 W/m K for a gas filling of 92%. The inventors have thus demonstrated the type of combinations of the various features of! the glazing unit that have to be employed in order to provide the optimum s 0 1uhi 0 n as regards the thermal insulation and light transmission performance of the glazing unit, and to prevent the formation of fogging and frosting on the outer and inner faces of the glazing unit :respectively, when it is used as an opening leaf in a refrigerated enclosure. The invention thus relates to the combination of a set of features of the 91azing unit, these being, in particular, the thickness of the gas ].ayer, the Lype of gas, the type of spacer, the types of functional coating used and their position, the heal transfer coefficient of the glazing unit and the presence ol an antifreeze layer. Other advantages and features of the invention w[ i ] become apparent in the resu of the description wi Lh regard to the appended drawings, which are not drawn to scale, <in which figures 1 and 2 illustrate, respectively, two partial sectional views of: two embodiments of a glazing unit according to the invention. Figure 1 illustrates, as a first embodiment of the invention, a gas-filled insulating triple glazing unit I0 containing no heating element and having at ]east one low-E coating 30 and an anti-frost coating 40, and exhibiting a heat transfer coefficient U of less than ].2 Wimpy, preferably less than 1.15 W/m2.K witty a gas fill factor of at least 85%, and an external light transmission factor of at least 67% combined wilt a light reflection of less than 18%. The triple glazing unit i0 comprises three glass substrates, namely a first substrate or inner substrate ii the external face ]]a of which is intended to be in contact with the inside of the enclosure when the opening leaf is in the closed position, a second substrate or intermediate substrate 12, and a third substrate or outer substrate 13, the external face 13a of which is intended to be in contact with the environment external to the enclosure. The first and third substrates 11 and 13 are preferably made of toughened glass. The faces of the substrates are denoted by ] to 6 and bear the references (i) to (6) in the figures - they correspond to the external face ]3a, intended to be in contact with the environment external to the enclosure, as far as the face lla intended to be Jn contact with the inside of the enclosure when the opening ]eat is in the closed position, respectively. The thickness of each of the substrates Js between 2 and 5 iron, and it is preferably 3 or 4 n so as to mininlize the overall weight of the glazing urlJt and to optfmJ, ze the ].ight trar smJ, ssio 1. The substrates are separated from orle another by a spacer 50 of low thermal conductivity, which spacer may consist of two separate elements or a single element astride the intermediate substrate. This spacer has a thermal conductivity coefficient of at most 1 W/m.K (or 1.88 BTU/hr.ft.F), preferably less than 0.7 Wim. K and better still less than 0.4 W!m.K. ]it will be recalled that 1 Bl'U/hr.ft.F corresponds to 0.534 W/m.K. One example of a spacer has a base body made of a thermoplastic, of the styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) or polypropylene type, and reinforcement fibers, of the glass type, which are blended with the thermoplastic, and also a metal foil providing a gas and water vapor seal, which is adhesively bonded to one part of the base body, said part being intended to lie on the opposite side from the internal airspace of the glazirlg unit. The base body, which also includes a dehydrating agent, is deposited around the periphery and in <he separating space between the substrates. An additional barrier, sealing the spacer with respect to liquids and vapor, which is made for example o po!ysuIi[de, polyurethane or silicone, is placed on the same side of the spacer as the metal foil. Such a spacer, which is based on SAN and glass fibers, is known for example by the brand name SWISSPACER®, from Saint-Gobain Glass, when the met:a] foil of the base body is made of aluminum, and by the name SWISSPACER V® when the metal foil el the base bccJy .s made of stainless stee!, and which assc<]attes with a double polysulfide barrier, has a thermal conductLwi ty coefficient of 0.64 W/m.W (or 1.20 BTU!hr. ft. F) in the case of SWI SSPACER > and (].25 W/m.K (or 0.47 BTU/hr.fL.F) in the case of SW]SSPACN}{ V®. Mention may also be made, as type el spacer, of the spacer di sc] osed in application we 01/79644, which consists of a substantially :flat profile placed, not on the inside of the glazing unit but on the outside, and fastened to the edges of the substrates. This strip may be based on stainless steel or aluminum or on a plastic reinforced with reinforcement fibers, its linear buckling strength being at least 400 N/re. This type of spacer includes, at least on one of its faces, a sealing barrier that seals against gases, dust and liquids, formed by a metal coating or a coating of any other suitable material. The spacer is for example made entirely oF a]urrlinkJm, with a thickness of 0.5 I and has a thermal conductivity coefficient of 0.25 W/m.K (or 0.47 BTU/hr.ft.F) • The airspace between the inner substrate i! and the intermediate substrate 12 is formed by an inner gas layer 14 and he airspace between the outer substrate 13 and the intermediate substrate i2 consists of an outer gas layer 15, the thickness of the gas layers being at least 4 mm and tailored according to the desired performance in terms of the heat transfer coefficient U, without however being greater than 16 mm. At least one of the gas layers consists of a rare gas, which is chosen from argon, krypton and xenon, w:[th a fill factor of at ].east 85%. For an even better coefficier t u, filling to at least 92% with krypton or xenon will be preferred. When the glazing unit has more than one gas layer, one of them may be air, and Jr thJ s cas(" t=he Lh:ic'kncss of the ail: layer is at least I0 Kma. The glazing unit includes a low-E coating 30 placed ('n at least part of the face 13b of the outer substrate ]3 facing the inside of the glazing unit (face 2) and!or another low-E coating 31 of the same type deposited on at least part of the face 12a of the intermedJ ate substrate 12 facing the inner substrate ll (face 4). The low-E coatings could also be provided on faces 2 and 3. When the glazing unit is simply provided with a single coating it is preferably placed on that surface associated with the thickness of the thicker gas layer. The ]ow-E coatings are based on layers of metal and metal oxides that can be obtained by various processes, namely by vacuum processes (thermal evaporate on, magnetron cathode sputtering or by pyrolytic depositio n of organometallic compounds, in liquid. solid or gaseous form, triad are propel Led by a carer .or gas onto the surface of the heated substrate. Preferably, the metal layers are based on silver and the metal oxide layers are based on zinc, Kin, titanium, aluminum, nickel, chromium or antimony (Sb compounds or nitride compounds or a mixture of az least two of these compounds, and optionally blocking ]_ayers, such as a blocker metal or a blocker metal alloy, o[ the Ti type, as upper layer of silver. As examples, mention may be made of the following multilayer coatings, for which the notation (TiO means that this is an opticna] element: or Tie× glass/SnO 2/TiO /ZnOiAg!NiCrOx/ (TiOz) /Sr O 2 /SnZnOx:Sb. For further details, in particular as rega r;@s the various embodiments of these multilayer <:<)at::.ngs, thicknesses and amounts of compounds, the reader may refer to patent applications FR 2 783 9]8 or EP ] 042 247. According to the invention, the type or coating allows a suitable compromise to be made between the optical quality of the substrate, in particular as regards i. ts light transmission in the visible, and its ref]ectJon quality in the infrared. The low-E coating used in the glazing unit of the invention has an emissivity not exceeding 0.3, preferably not exceeding 0.05, and a light transmJss:lon of greater than 75%, preferably greater than 85%. Furthermore, the product PT,ANTTHERH® FUTUR N from Saint-GobaJn Glass, which has, as glass 4 mm in thickness, an emissivity of 0.04 and Jght ransmisslon of 88.4%, may be used as SUDSLraLe provided w 1 th such a coating. Another suitable product also accordlnq to the invention is PLANITHERM® ULTRA Erom Saint-(]obain Glass which has, as glass 4 mm in thickness, n emissivity oi 0,02 and a ].i ht transmission o 6,7%, W.i.tn such a product used for one or all of the substrates, the coefficient U may be even better in terms of J.rlsu].Etlon than with the product PLANITHERM® 7UTU[% N but the glazing unit will lose ouu slightly in terms of light transmission. In addition, as ].east cne antireflectzon coating 32 may be provided on one or more substrates, re[erably <;n face 1 and/or face 3 and/or face 5. This has [:hc advantage, apart from its antireflectfon £unction, <)if increasing the light transmission of the g]az ng unJ. t and of further improving the visibility of the products in the display case. Final] y, the glazing unit includes an anti-frost coating 4 0 on the external face ] ] a of the [nne substrate ii. This coating may be a layer deposited dJ rectl] y on the substrate or depos ] fled 6911 a p] ast c fJJm fastened to the substrate. In particular, this anti-frost coating prevents, when the glazing unit provided with the anti-frost coating brought into contact, on that side of the coating, with a temperature environment falling to at most -30°C, in particular -15°C, -18°C or -24°C, and then into contact wi h an atmosphere at a temperature of at least 0°, preferably between i0° and 35°, especially ° and 30° and in particular 23° and 27°C and with at ]east 25% residual humidity, any frosting forming for at least ]2 s, preferably at least ] minute, in particular at least 2 minutes or even as i.ong as at least 3 minutes. The value of 3 mlnuues, in accordance with the EN441 sEanJard, is given for the usual conditions of use in a store. it goes without saying uhat the coating also fulfil]s its anti-frost function for any time that the opening Leaf is open, and irrespective of the frequency with which i is opened, for any time of less than 3 minutes and as soon as the temperature on t.he ¢oat rt< 1 side is at or below 0°C, whereas the temperature orl the opposite side is above 0°C, and even accompanied by high humidity. The frosting coating is adsorbent and absorbent. It is adsorbent in the sense that the water molecules arriving on the surface of the substrate are attached to the surface and bond to the surface, allowing the coating to fully play its absorption function. The coating Js absorbent hydrophilic) since the water molecules penetrate into Jr, and are thus absorbed. The coating includes an antifreeze compound tha<i lowers the crystallization temperature, such as a saJ L., especially KCI, NaCI or equivalent in solution arld/or an alcohol and/or a suitable hydropbfi lic polymer, copolymer, prepolymer or oligomer, optionally in water, and optionally one or more surfactants, this compound optionally having a hydrophobic character on part: of its surface. Thus, the antifreeze compound makes it possJoble for bonds to be created between said compound and the water molecules, preventing the latter from linking together and forming water crystals constituting the frost. As alcohols in the antifreeze compound, ethan<)] or isopropanol is especially employed. The hydrophilic polymers, copolymers, prepo±ymers o oligomers as constituents of the solution are in particular based on polyvinylpyrrolidone of the polyln-viny]-2-pyrrolidone, or poly(l-vinylpyrrolidorle ype, polyvinylp ridine O [I]@ poly(n-vinyl-2-pyrridinel nype, of the p01yln-vinyl-3-pyrridineJ type or of the poly{n-vinyl-4-pyrridine ype, a polyacrylate of the po]y(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate] type, a po yacTyi.amidc of the poly(N',N-hydroxyaor}iamide, type, polyvinyl acetate, polyacrylonitrJle, or of the po]yo[ tyoe, such as polyvinyl a]c0h0i, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glyco], po]yoxyethylene. In particular, he copolymers are based on az least one of the constituent monomers of these polymers. The choice of hydrophilic polymer and of the porosity makes ]t possible in particular to regular the rate o[- water absorption and the water absorbti vity. The porosity of the layer is advantar]eous!y b,etweeF @.] and ]00 cm3/g and preferably bess than 20 cm3/g. The porosity defines the void vo]oume of the pores per unJ of weight of he layer. As surfactants, mention may be made of compounds comprising a ]ipophilic part Y, whii ch may be an unsaturated, linear or branched, aliphatic chain or drl aromatic or alkylaromatic chain, and an ] on i c or nonionic hydrophilic head. Examples of these are: - anionic surfactants: Y-C0 2 M+; Y-OSO 3 -M+; Y-SO 3 - M+; dodecylbenzene sulfonate; alkyl sulfonates; sulfonated fatty acids and fatty acid esters; alky!ary] sulfonates; cationic surfactants : Y- (R) p NH4{ 4 n X-; YR 4 N+,X-; alkyltrimethyl ammonium salts; alkyibenzyldimethyl ammonium salts; imidazol J nium salts; amine salts; - zwitterionic surfactants: Y-N ..... CO - ; Y-N+ ..... S0 3 -; betaines; su] fobetaines; i m:i dazo! i um salts; and - nonionic surfactants : Y-OR; Y-OH; Y-CO 2 R; Y-CONHR; Y-(CH 2 -CH -O)n-; polyols; alcohols; acids; esters; polyethoxylated fatty alcohols. Furthermore, it is desirable Eor t:he ar k i freeze function of the coating to be lastirlg, which [lay require improving the mechanical strength o the layer incorporating the antifreeze compound, i n par[_i cu ]ar when said layer is likely to suffer occasion mechanic@] contact, or has to be cleaned. For this purpose, the antifreeze compound may be crosslinked and/or combined with at least one other comDotlnd so as to establish a physical interaction or a chemica! interaction with it, and/or it may be dispersed in a sei! [d matrix, for example an organic or minera] matrix or a mixed matrix of the ORMOCER (organJca].ly modified ceramic) Lype, o - a sol-gel compound. The term "physical interaction" is understood here to mean a hydrogen bond, a polar interaction off the van der Waal's type or a hydrophobic interaeLion, These interactions being capable of provide di ng mechan i ca I reinforcement similar to cross] inking. Such phys :i ca I interaction is for example achieved by mixing polyvinylpyrrolidone as antifreeze compound with po]yurethane as matrix compound for said antifreeze compound. Chemical interaction on the other hand results .from blending the antifreeze compound with at ] east one other compound so as to create covalent bonds between them, the blend undergoing in a known manner a heat treatment for example, or a UV crosslinking step, a room-temperature crosslinking step, etc. it is thus possible to blend a po]yol as antifreeze compound with another compound having isocyanate funcuJona[ groups, and o hear this blend so as co obtain a polyurethane havina the hydrophilicity lunctiona]Jty through the antifreeze compound and mechanical integrlry through the chemica I interaction between: the h]zdroxy] funct]onal groups of the p01y01 dnd tl . J s0<]yan;;t functi0na] groups. For particular composition examples, the reader may refer to parent applications WO 00/71481 and FR 05,'50271. In this first embodiment of the invention, several alternative forms may be envisaged depending on the desired level of the heal transfer coe ffic]enc U, together with a compromise between size and weight of the glazing uni< and its optical pr0perules. Table I below gives several embodiment examples A to E of triple glazing units that meet the desired performance requirements Jn terms of Jnsu lati on and absence of fogging or frosting, without having to heat the glazing unit. Indicated in this table are the overall tbJ:ckness of the glazing unit, the thicknesses of the glass substrates, the face or faces of the glazing unit that include the low-E coating, the thicknesses of the gas layers, the type of gas, the light transmission and the outer light reflection provided by such glazing units, the heat transfer coefficient U of the glazing unit, for example obtained relative to the chosen gas and to the gas fill factor (85% or 92%), and the overall heat transfer coefficient Uw of the opening leaf incorporating such a glazing unit. For each of these examples: - the spacer 50 of low thermal conduct, i. vity consists of two separate elements for each of the two airspaces of the glazing uni<, corresponding to the product SWISSPACER V® from Saint-Gobain Glass described above; - low-E coatings 30 and 31 are deposited on glass substrates corresponding to the products PLANITHERM® FUTUR N from Saint-Gobain Glass, with %h@ @Xeeption of Example A1 which corresponds to Example A for which on O[ the substrate is replaced with PLANITHERM® ULTRA from Saint-Gobain Glass, the speck. flC details of which were described above; - the anti-frOSE coating 40 is deposited directly on the glass substrate I this beirlg an EVERCLEAR® coating sold by Saint-G0baffn Glass; and - the antireflection coatings 32 are deposited on glass substrates, these coatings corresponding to the VISION-LITE Plus® products from saint-Gobain Glass. The heat transfer coefficient U of the glazing unit was calculated at the center of the unit and accord]nq to the prEN 6/3 and prl<N 4]0 standards. This calculation was also i -deDendent of the type of: spacer. The overall heat transfer coefficient [ j of the cpenJr g leaf was calculated for the glazing units incorporated, respect ve] y, in an a] umi hum frame wi th a therma ] bridge break, a conventional frame for refrigerated enclosures and in a PVC frame. This calcu]at[on, according to the EN ISO 10077-2 standard, takes into account the dimensions of the opening i ea:f, of the glazing unit and of the frame, and also the type of spacer and the type of frame. The opening leaf was of 1800 mm x 800 rmm format, the frame had a square section of 40 mm x 40 s l wi th a heal transfer coefficient U of 2.6 W/m2.K in the case of aluminum and 1.8 Wim2.K in the case of fJVC. The glazing unit was fitted into a rebate over a width of 25 mm.

The overall heat transfer coefficient Uw of the opening leaf into which such glazing units is incorporated does not exceed 1.25 W!m2.K with a gas fill factor of at least 92%. These glazing units thus make it possible to obtain a light transmission of at least 67% and an external light reflection of less than 18%. The figures given take account of the presence of the antifreeze layer, which lowers the light transmission factor by only about 0.5%. In the case of Example AI, as already explained above', the use of the PLANITHERM® ULTRA iow-E glass substrate makes it possible, compared with Example A, to further increase the thermal insulation performance, although the glazing unit does however lose out s]ightly Jn terms of optical quality, the latter neverthe]ess remaining very acceptable. The use of an an<ireflection layer, for example, on faces i, 3 and 5 Example E results in an overall transmission of 79.8% with reduced light reflection, namely 7.2%, giving th@ glazing unit very comfortable optical properties. Example C, using 0nly a single krypton layer, may be preferred to Example B when the cost of the glazing unit is of concern, since krypton is an extensive gas. Moreover, this Example C also demonsura<es the situation that would occur if the gas from one of the completely. Finally, it is estimated that over the course of time the loss of gas in a glazing unit is 1% per year (prI{',N 1279-3) standard. Thus, after several years, a glazing unit would see its gas fill factor drop and consequently its thermal insulation performance would also drop. The row in the table indicating the coefficient U with a fill factor of 85% thus stimulates the thermal performance of a glazing unit after I years when having been initially filled with 92% gas. Figure 2 illustrates a second embodiment of the invention for which the opening leaf ] comprises an insulating double glazing unit 20 filled with xenon and/or with krypton and/or with argon, with no heating element, but including at least one low-E coating and an anti-frost coating 40. This double g_]azing unit has a heat transfer coefficient U of less than 1.2 W!m 2.K, preferably less than 1.15 W/m 2.K, and a light transmission of at least 75%. The double glazing unit 20 comprises two glass substrates 21 and 22 designed to be in contact with the environment of the refrigerated enclosure and with the external environment, respectively. They are spaced apart by a spacer 50 of low thermal conductivity, such as the one described in the first embodiment. The gas layer 23 between the two substrates has a thickness of between 4 and 16 mm, preferably at least 8 me. A low-E coating 30 is placed on a ].east one inner [ace of the glazing unit, i.e. on face 2 and!or on face 3. The coating is of the <ype of those described in the firs embodiment, being based on silver and on metal The antifreeze coating 40 is deposited on the external[ face 21a of the inner substrate and corresponds to Lhat described in the first< embodiment. An antireflection coating 32 may be provided on at least one of the substrates, preferab]y on face ] and/or face 3 of the glazing unit. Table II below illustrates three examples F, G and }7 of the double glazing unit according to the invention. The heat transfer coefficient U was calculated at the center of the glazing unit according to the prEN 6/3 and prEN 410 standards. This calculation was also independent of the spacer type. The low-E coating corresponded to PLANITHERM® FUTUR N from Saint-Gobain Glass. The anti-frost coating corresponded to EVERCLEAR® from Saint-Gobain Glass and the antireflection coating corresponded to VISION-LITE Plus® from Saint-Gobain Glass. Similarly to the first embodiment, the overa]l heat transfer coefficient U of the opening ]_ea.f in which these types of double glazing unit are incorporated was calculated as explained above with the same dimensions, the same type of spacer and the same type of frame.

The opening leaves thus have an overall heat transfer coefficient Uw of less than ].25 W/m2.K for a gas fill factor of at least 92% with an aluminum frame, and even less than 1.20 W/m2.K for a gas fill factor of at least 92% with a PVC frame. The light transmission for Examples I and G is at. [east. 78% and vQry dwntageously exceeds 81.5% when an antireflection coating is added, with a light reflection of 9.6% and [ ptctive]y. The glazing units according to the first and second embodiments of the invention meet Environment Classes 2, 3, 4 and 5 given in the standard EN44]. and repeated n TaBle III Below, and in particular they meet Class 6 when the heat transfer coefficient U is below 0.8, such as in the case of Example B D ahd Z.
