(2) 3-(4-Iodophenyl)propanoic acid succinimidyl ester
3-(4'-Iodophenyl)propanoic acid (10 mmol, 2.76 g, 1.0 eq.) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (15 mmol, 1.73 g, 1.5 eq) were dissolved in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (40 mL). The mixture was cooled to 0Â° C., and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 15 mmol, 3.09 g, 1.5 eq) dissolved in 20 mL CH2Cl2 was added drop-wise slowly. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The N,N'-dicyclohexylurea was filtered out, the residue was washed with CH2Cl2, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness purified by column chromatography and recrystallization with iso-propanol or toluene/hexane to afford succinimide as white solid (3.50 g, 94%).
