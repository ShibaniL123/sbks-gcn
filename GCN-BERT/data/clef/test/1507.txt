Example 90A
Methyl 4-({[6-bromo-3-methyl-2-(5-methyl-2-thienyl)quinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
At RT, 236 mg (0.62 mmol) of HATU and 0.22 ml (1.24 mmol) of DIPEA were added to a solution of 150 mg (0.41 mmol) of the compound from Example 89A in 1.5 ml of DMF, and the mixture was then stirred at RT for 30 min. Subsequently, 136 mg (0.62 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, dissolved in 1 ml of DMF, were added and the mixture was stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, the mixture was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 3). This gave 16 mg (7% of theory, purity 100%) of the title compound
