FIELD A motorcycle helmet with increased visibility and improved road illumination provided by a front facing beam type light that can act as a point-able headlight allowing the wearer to point a light beam at an object in front of the motorcycle, such as an edge of a road or a vehicle on a side road. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART Motorcycles are small vehicles that carry limited road illumination capability and have reduced visibility to other drivers. The visibility of a motorcycle is particularly low to automobile drivers entering a road that the motorcycle is traveling where the auto pulls onto the road from a side road or street or turns across the road in front of the motorcycle. This appears to be due to the automobile driver typically looking for other automobiles and not being accustomed to the low visibility of motorcycle. What is needed is to increase visibility of a motorcycle to drivers of automobiles and other larger vehicles. Because a motorcycle headlight points in a direction of a front wheel, when making a turn, the headlight beam may not point into or around the turn. What is needed is light beam that can be pointed by the rider in a direction determined by the rider that is independent of the direction the front wheel is pointing. Another frequent motorcycle accident scenario is due to the poor rear visibility of a motorcyclist when a larger vehicle is approaching from the rear. Light systems are needed that can be synchronized with the motorcycles running lights, turn signals and brake lighting to increase visibility from the rear of a motorcycle. Extra emergency lighting is also needed when the electrical system malfunctions or when the rider may need to abandon the motorcycle and travel along a dark road. SUMMARY A motorcycle helmet that includes one or more white light type beam forming LEDs (LEDs with lenses that form a beam) mounted in the front of the helmet, such as the helmet forehead area. The LEDs may function as a headlight that may supplement the motorcycle headlight by having a downward pointing aspect when worn by the rider. The beam(s) projected by the LEDS can be steered or aimed at an object by the helmet wearer and may help the rider and motorcycle be more visible to oncoming vehicles or vehicles entering from a side road. The LEDS may be in a self contained module mounted on the outside of the helmet. The LEDs may be mounted or embedded in the outer shell of the helmet with the batteries and electronics being inside the shell and within the foam type compressible inner shell. The batteries and electronics may also be within the helmet neck roll near the bottom rim of the helmet. LEDs, red and yellow or orange, may also be located in the rear of the helmet and function as additional brake lights and turn signal lights. A cable or wireless system may be used to send brake turn signal and headlight signals to the helmet to control the LEDs. LEDS may also be located on sides of the helmet to increase visibility from the side.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The visibility and illumination features of a motorcycle rider can be improved by an embodiment including a light module 10 mounted on a front side of a helmet 12, such as an open face helmet depicted in FIG. 1. The module 10 includes one or more white light type light emitting diodes (LEDs) 14 that point away from the front of the helmet 12 in a direction that a rider is looking and project one or more white light beams that can be pointed by the helmet wearer. The module 10 includes batteries, an on/off switch and electronic components (not shown) needed to power the LED and is, thus, self contained. The module 10 may even contain LEDs that allow the beam shape and brightness to be changed. The module 10 may be attached to the helmet 12 by a hinged bracket 16 with a friction hinge that allows the vertical angle of the beam to be adjusted/pivoted (see arrows) to align with a rider's preference for the vertical axis of where the beam is pointed. The bracket 16 may be secured to the helmet 12 via glue, screws, rivets or another attachment mechanism. The bracket 16 may be mounted on the helmet above the typical face shield snaps 18 that are used to secure a face shield (not shown) or the face shield may include a cutout (not shown) for the module 10. A typical module may be obtained from Energizer as Energizer 06488 (HD7L33AE). Although FIG. 1 shows a single LED, more than one LED may be provided and LEDS other than white light LEDs may be provided, such as also red light LEDs that may be used at night and may improve the visibility of the rider. FIG. 2 depicts a full face embodiment of an improved visibility and illumination helmet 20. This embodiment depicts three LEDs 22 recessed in a body or shell of the helmet above the face plate or shield 24 so that a front surface of each LED 22 is at or below an outside or front surface of the shell. Wiring (not shown) inside the helmet 20 connects the LEDs 22 to a power and control module 26 that may be mounted on a rear lower portion of the helmet 20 allowing access to batteries that can be changed as well as an on/off switch. By having the LEDs 22 recessed when the rider raises the face shield 24, when the face shield 24 is pivoting, the LEDs do not interfere with the shield 24. LEDs, such as Bolt Beam 5 mm LED Light 5B-C or B from Super Bright LEDs, Inc., may be used as LEDs 22. The control module 26 may also be integrated into the inside of the helmet 20 as discussed later herein. FIG. 3 depicts a full face, clam shell, two piece embodiment of an improved helmet 30. The helmet 30 opens about a pivot 32 located near a rear of the helmet 30. Again the LEDs 34 (four in this depiction) are recessed into the body of the helmet 30 in an upper section 36 allowing a lower section 38 to pivot up without interfering with the LEDs 34. Wiring (not shown) inside the helmet 30 connects the LEDs 34 to a power and control module 40 that may be mounted on a rear lower portion of the helmet 30. FIG. 3 a depicts a half helmet or cap type motorcycle helmet 39 that includes one or more LEDs that face forward and can be used to illuminate objects by the motorcycle rider, FIG. 4 depicts side and top views of a preferred embodiment of a beam pattern 40 produced by the embodiments of FIGS. 1-3 when the rider 41 looks down the road. FIG. 5 depicts the beam pattern 40 when the rider 41 turns his head to the left, such as when a rider 41 wants to inform an automobile 42 driver of the rider's presence on the road or a pedestrian standing on a side of the road who might step out into the road in front of the rider 41 or illuminate something on the left side of the road. FIG. 6 shows the beam pattern 40 when the rider 41 looks down at the road surface 44, such as when looking at debris in the road. As can be seen, the LED(s) produce a pattern 40 that extends in a direction that the rider 41 is looking independent of motorcycle travel direction and both helps illuminate the direction of travel and objects associated with the road and identify the rider to others on and around the road. Other types of helmets can also use recessed LEDs, such as a cap type helmet and an open face helmet such as shown in FIG. 1. The cap type can also use the module embodiment of FIG. 1. FIG. 7 depicts a side cutaway view of a helmet 62 including an outer shell 64 of fiber glass or carbon fiber, a compressible inner shell 66 made of a substance, such as closed cell foam (closed-cell extruded/expanded, polystyrene foam), and padding 68/69. A recessed LED 70 is positioned secured against in the outer shell 64 and within the inner shell 66 using a reinforcement member 72. The diode 70 is surrounded by the reinforcement member 72 ant it reinforces the helmet structure around the penetration of the helmet outer shell 64 resulting from the recessed position of LED 70 and also supports the LED 70. The reinforcement member 72 may include a tube 74, made of a material such as metal, surrounding the LED 72 with a flange 76 that are also embedded in the helmet shell. A light emitting lens surface 77 of the LEDs is even with or below an outside surface of the shell 64. A transparent protective cover 78 seals the penetration and smoothes the outside surface for good airflow. An electronic circuit 80 for the LED 70 along with a battery compartment 82 for power can also be positioned against the shell 64 and inside or within the shell 66. An opening in the inner shell 66 between the padding sections 68 can be provided to allow the battery to be changed and the LED power to be switched on/off. As depicted by arrow 81 the angle of the LED as it points through the shell may be adjusted up/down, right left to allow the pointing direction of the light beam produced to be adjusted to match a direction that the wearers eyes naturally look when wearing the helmet while they may also be generally pointing downward while in the riding position to avoid creating glare on other drivers eyes. That is, the LEDs can be adjusted to match the natural viewing direction of the wearer while avoiding causing a light hazard. The LED(s) of the embodiments can also be located at other places on a helmet and still face forward so that a beam(s) is projected in a direction that the rider is looking. FIG. 8 shows recessed LEDs 82 mounted in the lower section 84 of a clam shell helmet 86 beside the face shield 88. FIG. 9 shows another embodiment where LEDs 90 are recessed in the lower section or chin guard portion 92 of a clam shell helmet 94. Of course LEDS could be as in FIGS. 2, 3, 8 and 9. The arrangement/pattern of the LEDs of any particular grouping, such as the linear array, three LED group as in the embodiment of FIG. 2 or four LED linear arrangement of FIG. 3 can have several other arrangements. For example, as shown in FIG. 10a, the array can be a two dimensional aligned array including six LEDs, or a staggered array, such as the seven LEDs as in FIG. 10b. FIGS. 10c-10e show other patterns where, for example, a larger more powerful LED may be included among less powerful LEDs (see FIG. 10d), The LEDs could also be arranged in an arc(s) or diagonal(s). When multiple LEDs are used the beam pattern(s) produced can vary. FIG. 11a shows three diodes where the beam patterns overlap. This overlap can be both horizontal or vertical or both. FIG. 11b shows beam patterns that diverge and have no overlap. The divergence of FIG. 11b can be vertical as well as horizontal. FIG. 11c shows two weak beams overlapping with a stronger beam while FIG. 11d shows two weak beams that do not overlap with a stronger beam. Of course, the arrangement can allow some beams to overlap and some to diverge. The patterns can also point at a same spot at a desired distance from the rider, so that the beams merge. The beams could also point to the side to illuminate the rider's peripheral vision areas, as well as downward to illuminate the motorcycle gauge area. The front facing LEDs, as depicted in FIG. 11, may be designed to produce beams that increase the visibility of the user/rider to oncoming and side road traffic and for the rider to be able to direct that increased visibility in a desired direction. The beams need not be designed as a spotlight that would create glare, but rather may produce diffuse type or low power beam(s) that also may be directed as desired. An embodiment, such as in FIG. 11b or FIG. 11d, because the beams do not overlap, may also be used to produce a visibility increasing type light that does not create a spotlight or glare. As noted previously, the color of the LEDs can be white or red as well as other colors such as yellow or orange that may more particularly get the attention of another driver or illuminate the road. One or more of the LEDs could blink (or strobe), or allow changes in brightness over a period of time or based on the background illuminations, such as be brighter in the day time than in the night time, or as controlled by the rider, for example, high beams. FIG. 2 shows the electronics and battery compartment 26 for the LEDs as being located on the back lower edge of the helmet 20. It is also possible to position the compartment 200 (see FIG. 16) below the back rim 202 of the helmet 204. It is further possible to have a form factor radio communications modules provided for motorcycle helmets, such as provided by the Schuberth SRC-S or Bluetooth System, or configured as in a motorcycle police officer helmet such as available from PVP Communications, Inc. For example, the compartment 200 can be a module that replaces the padded neck roll at the bottom edge of the helmet. In this approach the compartment does not extend below the bottom edge of the helmet and buttons for controlling on/off and other functions, such as high beam, would be located at the bottom edge of the helmet near the side behind the helmet strap. This compartment may include rechargeable batteries as well as the control circuit for the LEDs mounted on the front forehead region of the helmet. It is also possible to incorporate the module into the inside of the helmet as depicted in FIG. 12. As can be seen, the LED 120 is recessed in the helmet shell 122 and includes wiring 124 that connects to a control module 126 having an adjacent battery compartment 128 depicting two batteries. This arrangement is surrounded and covered by padding 130 and may include an optional hinged pad 132 (shown by dashed lines) that can be used to cover the battery compartment 128 and allow access when needed to change the batteries. A simple push button 134 beneath the padding or one positioned at the interface between the components 128 and 126 can be used to activate the LED(s). FIG. 12 shows the interior electronics arranged above the LEDs but could be arranged at other places, such as beside the LEDs. The embodiment of FIG. 12 shows one in which the batteries can be changed. However, it is possible to have batteries that can be recharged and provide a recharging plug for recharging the batteries inside or through the helmet shell. It is preferable that this plug be located in the rear of the helmet with the male/female component aligned with the outer helmet shell. It is also possible to provide an external connection that will allow the module 126 to be connected to the motorcycle battery, eliminating the need for batteries. The helmet can also include LEDs on the rear side that function as driving, brake and turn signal lights. FIG. 13 shows such an arrangement where the rear of a helmet 130 is shown. The center group 132 of nine recessed red colored LEDs functions as a driving light shining to provide a reference for the arrow shaped turn signal groups 134 and functions as a brake light by producing a brighter set of overlapped beams when the brakes are applied. This difference in apparent illumination during braking can be accomplished by changing the LED drive current of all of the LEDs or by turning some of the LEDS on when the brakes are applied. The turn signal groups 134 may be yellow LEDS, orange LEDS, blinking LEDs with a blinking pattern that may change as brakes are applied with more or less force. FIG. 13 shows the group 132 with nine LEDS and groups 134 as having nine LEDS each, although the number of LEDs in each group (132 and 134) may vary. Also shown is wiring that connects the LEDs 132 and 134 to a control unit 138 that powers the LEDs based on signals from the motorcycle brake and turn signal controller 140 using energy from the motorcycle battery 142. The control unit 138 may be located in the helmet like the previous discussed embodiments or on the motorcycle. Note, the control module for the white light front facing LED(s) may also be located on the motorcycle plug connectable wiring connected between the helmet and motorcycle. FIG. 13 shows a connector 139 that allows the control unit, controller and batteries to be plugged into the helmet. This connector is show as allowing connection from outside the shell but could be an interior connector. This allows the control unit to be located on the motorcycle or as a clip-on unit that can clip to the riders belt or be placed in the rider's pocket. FIG. 14 depicts another embodiment that uses a strap type headlight or task work light 160, such as available from Energizer like model HD7L33INE that includes an adjustable tilt feature 161. In this embodiments clips 162 are provided that hook over the strap 162 and under the edge 164 of the helmet 166 in the front forehead region) and rear (neck region) to hold the headlight 160 from sliding off the top of the helmet 166 due to wind and to also allow the headlight to be easily removed when not in use. FIG. 15 shows an embodiment in which a shape of the helmet 180 has been reconfigured to provide a compartment in which the batteries and LED(s) can be provided without impacting a thickness of the cell foam inner shell. The reconfiguration includes a “bump” 182 that allows the compartment 184 to be formed between the outer shell 186 and inner shell 188. A section 190 of the foam inner shell 188 may be removed to allow access to the compartment 184. FIG. 17 shows a strap headlight type embodiment that uses the snaps on the helmet that can be used to hold a face shield or a visor. In this embodiment, the helmet outer shell 212 includes a male snap 214. Another double sided snap 216 is provided that includes a female snap 218 and a male snap 220. Attached to the snap 216 is a ring like clip 221 that attaches to the snap 216, extends upward and wraps around the headlight strap 222 so that the wind will not blow the headlight off of the top of the helmet. FIG. 18 shows an embodiment with a double outer shell 232 that creates a compartment 234 that may be used for the LED 236, electronics 238, wiring 240 and battery compartment 242. The double outer shell 232 may include a first outer shell 244 of fiberglass or carbon fiber and a second outer shell 246, also of fiberglass or carbon fiber that confronts the closed cell foam inner shell 66. An opening in the shell 246 can be provided to allow access to the compartment. An alternative to the wired connection is to provide a wireless connection (see discussion below) between the motorcycle controller 140 and the LED controller 138, power the LEDs with a battery like the front LEDs and mount the controller 138 similar to the previously discussed embodiments in a module on the outside or inside the helmet. FIG. 19 shows a circuit for powering the headlight like LED (array). An LED 262 (or LED array with individually controllable LEDs) may be powered by a power circuit 264 from a battery power source 266. The power circuit is controlled by a control unit 268. The control unit 268 is controlled by a toggle switch 270 that may be a multiple position toggle switch 270. The controller 268 may turn on the LED 262 continuously or with some on/off pattern depending on the setting of the toggle switch 270. The pattern could be a blinking or flashing pattern where all of the LEDs in an array blink, or one where the some of the LEDs in the array blink and some are on continuously, or in some other pattern. The toggle switch 270 may be located in association with the lower side edge of the helmet on a left side and reachable with the rider's left hand. FIG. 20 a shows another embodiment for controlling the front facing LED(s). The control unit 268 may receive a control signal from a receiver 282. The receiver 282 may receive a wireless signal from a transmitter 284 via a wireless format, such as Bluetooth. The signal sent by the transmitter 284 may be a signal from the motorcycle light control unit. For example, when the ignition key of the motorcycle is turned on the headlight of the motorcycle is turned on a control signal to turn on the helmet front facing LED array may be produced. As another example, the helmet can turn on a part of the LED array when the headlights are turned on and turn on all of the LEDS of the array when the “high beam” of the motorcycle headlight is turned on. The control circuits of FIGS. 19 and 20a may also control the brake and turn light LEDs that may be located on the back of the helmet and discussed previously herein. For example, the brake light LEDs on the back of the helmet could be turned on when the controller 268/282 activates the brake light of the motorcycle. Likewise when one of the turn signals of the motorcycle is activated, the controller may turn on the turn signal LEDs on the back of the helmet. The signals that control the brake and turn signal LEDs on the back of the helmet may be controlled in a pattern. For example, the brake signal LEDs could be blinked at a steady rate or at a rate that increases as the braking force applied increases. As another example, the array of LEDs for the turn signal on the back of the helmet may be turned on and off in a pattern that progresses from the center of the helmet toward the direction in which the turn is to take place. When the turn signal array is in the shape of an arrow this would create an arrow that progressively points in the direction of the turn, further enhancing the turn direction information conveyed to any driver behind the motorcycle. In addition the brake light LEDs on the back of the helmet could also be activated to help the following driver distinguish the direction of the tern by using the brake light as a reference. FIG. 20 b shows a still further embodiment. In this embodiment a senor 292 located in the helmet and powered by the battery 266 may be provided. The sensor 292 produces a control signal supplied to the control unit 268 that controls, for example, the brake light LEDs on the back of the helmet. The sensor 292 may be one of several different types of sensors. For example, the sensor 292 may be an accelerometer that produces a signal when the motorcycle slows down or slows down at a rate above some threshold. The rear brake LEDs could also flash at a rate that is proportional to the deceleration or flash brighter proportional to the deceleration. The sensor may be a distance type sensor, such as ultrasonic sensor or radar sensor, that senses a distance of a following vehicle and turns of the brake light LEDs when the vehicle is closer that a threshold distance or is closing at above a threshold closing rate. A further alternative is for the accelerometer that will turn the brake LEDs brighter when there is a deceleration and turn on the left or right blinking turn signal LEDs when a lean to the right or left is detected. The discussion has included putting the batteries for the LEDs in the helmet. It is also possible to provide a battery pack that can be strapped to the waist or attached to the rider's belt. The pack may also include the circuit components that drive the LEDs of the helmet. A power cord or cable is then provided to connect the helmet LEDs to the power pack. This will allow the rider to dismount the bike without unhooking a power cord. 1.
