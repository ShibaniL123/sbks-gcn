(Reference Example 6) Synthesis of 1-ethyl-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde:
A solution of n-butyllithium in n-hexane (1.6 M, 7.15 mL, 11.4 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 1-ethyl-1H-imidazole (1.00 g, 10.4 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (26 mL) at -78Â°C and the reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour. N,N-dimethylformamide (2.42 mL, 31.2 mmol) was added to the reaction liquid at the same temperature, and the reaction liquid was stirred for 1 hour, and then, the temperature of the reaction liquid was raised to room temperature. A saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride was added to the reaction liquid and then the reaction liquid was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain 1-ethyl-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde (1.12 g, 9.02 mmol, 87%) as a yellow oil.
