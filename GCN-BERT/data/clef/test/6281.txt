FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the field of nutraceuticals, and in particular to nutraceuticals comprising n-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). Compositions comprising NGNA find use in inducing physiological responses such as alleviating the symptoms of viral-induced obesity, alleviating the symptoms of colds, preventing the onset of colds, increasing energy and increasing the feeling of well-being in subjects. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Obesity is a prevalent nutritional disorder in the United States. Obesity in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood represents a serious concern and a challenge to the medical and lay communities. Major impacts include effects on blood pressure, intermediary metabolism, respiratory function, psychological well-being, social adaptation, and educational performance. Obesity is associated with significant adult morbidity, including long-term effects on cardiovascular health and premature mortality. Accumulation of excess fat mass occurs when total energy intake exceeds total energy expenditure, including the energy allowance for normal growth. This energy imbalance can result from excessive energy intake and/or reduced energy expenditure for body metabolism, thermoregulation, and physical activity. Increases in energy intake are observed in genetic syndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing syndrome, and drug-induced obesity. Reductions in energy expenditure characterize hormonal deficiency states, including hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency. The etiology of obesity is considered to be multifactorial. Animal obesity has been classified into nine different groups, including obesity of neural, endocrine, pharmacological, nutritional, environmental, seasonal, genetic, idiopathic or of viral origin (see, e.g., Sclaffini, A. (1984) Int. J. Obesity 8: 491-508; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). While genetic and behavioral components of obesity have been the focus of intense study, six pathogens have been reported to cause obesity in animal models (see, e.g., Atkinson R. L., et al., (1997) Int. J. of Obesity 21:S36; Carter J. K., et al., (1983) Infect. Immun. 39:410-422; Carter J. K., et al., (1983) Avian Dis 27:317-322; Dhurandhar N. V., et al., (1990) J. Bombay Vet. College 2:131-132; Dhurandhar N. V., et al., (1992) Vet. Microbiol. 31:101-107; Dhurandhar N. V., et al., (1996) Obesity Res 4:24S; Dhurandhar N. V., et al., (2000) Int. J. Obesity 24:989-996; Gosztonyi G., et al., (1995) Current Topics in Microbiol. Immunol. 190:39-73; Lyons M. J., et al., (1982) Science 216:82-85; each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties). Indeed, the human adenovirus Ad-36 is implicated in causing obesity in humans (see, e.g., Atkinson R. L., et al., (1998) Int. J. Obesity 22:S57; Dhurandhar N. V., et al., (1997) FASEB J 3:A230; each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties). Treatment options for virally induced obesity is limited to traditional approaches (e.g., diet management, exercise management, lifestyle management, surgery, and anorectic agents (e.g., phentermine, phenylpropanolamine, mazindol, ephedra, and sibutramine)). What is needed are improved methods of treating viral obesity.

A. Viral Obesity In the U.S., the prevalence of obesity increased by 30% from 1980 to 1990, and this increase appears to be continuing. One etiology of human obesity is of infectious origin (see, e.g., Dhurandhar, N. (2001) J. Nutr. 131: 2794S-2797S; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Six pathogens are reported to cause obesity in animals. Canine distemper virus was the first virus reported to cause obesity in mice (see e.g., Lyons M., et al., (1982) Science 216:82-85; Bernard A., et al., (1988) Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 91B:691-696; Bernard A., et al., (1991) Virology 313:545-551; Bernard A., et al., (1993) J. Neuropath. Exp. Neuro. 52:471-480; McFerran J., et al., (1975) Am. J. Vet. Res. 36:527-534; Bernard A., et al., (1999) J. Virology 73(9):7317-7327; each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties), followed by the avian retrovirus Rous-associated virus-7 shown to cause stunting, obesity and hyperlipidemia in chickens (see e.g., Carter J. K., et al., (1983) Infect. Immun. 39:410-422; Carter J. K., et al., (1983) Avian Dis 27:317-322; each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties). The obesity-promoting effect of Borna disease virus has been demonstrated in rats (see e.g., Gosztonyi G. & Ludwig H. (1995) Current Topics in Microbiol. Immunol. 190:39-73; Fabricant C. G., et al., (1983) Federation Proc 42:2476-2479; each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties). Scrapie agents were reported to induce obesity in mice and hamsters (see e.g., Kim Y. S., et al., (1987) J. Infect. Dis. Aug; 156(2):402-405; Carp R. L., et al., (1990) J. Infect. Dis. 161(3):462-466; Carp R. L., et al., (1998) J. Gen. Virol. 79(Pt 11):2863-2869; Kim Y. S., et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 189(1):21-27; each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties). The final two reports were of SMAM-1, an avian adenovirus (see e.g., Dhurandhar N. V., et al., (1990) J. Bombay Vet. College 2:131-132; Dhurandhar N. V., et al., (1992) Vet. Microbiol. 31:101-107; Ajinkya S. M. (1985) Final Technical Report, ICAR 1985:13-43 Red and Blue Cross Publishing Bombay, India; each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties), and Ad-36 (see e.g., Dhurandhar N. V., et al., (2000) Int. J. Obesity 24:989-996; Dhurandhar N. V., et al., (2001) Int. J. Obesity 25:990-996; Kolesar J. M., et al., (2000) J. Chromatog. B. 744:1-8; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), a human adenovirus that caused obesity in animals. Additionally, an association with human obesity is the unique feature of SMAM-1 (see, e.g., Dhurandhar N. V., et al., (1997) Obesity Res 5:464-469; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) and Ad-36 (see, e.g., Vangipuram, S. D., et al., (2004) Obesity Research 12:770-777; Dhurandhar, N. V., et al., (2002) J. Nutr. 132:3155-3160; Atkinson R. L., et al., (1998) Int. J. Obesity 22:S57; Dhurandhar N. V., et al. (1997) FASEB J 3:A230; Atkinson R. L., et al., (2000) Int. J. Obesity suppl 1:S39; Dhurandhar N. V., et al.; (1999) FASEB J 13(4):A369; each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties). U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,127,113 and 6,664,050, each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties, characterize Ad-36 induced viral obesity. In particular, humans who suffer from viral obesity (i.e., obesity caused by a virus) have, on the average, significantly lower triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (CHOL) and low-density-lipoprotein-associated cholesterol (LDL-CHOL) levels than persons who suffer from obesity that is not viral. In fact, the average TG, CHOL and LDL-CHOL levels of persons with viral obesity are within the normal ranges for persons who are not obese. Diagnostic and screening approaches for Ad-36 and Ad-36p are provided. Anti-obesity vaccines, wherein inactivated viral nucleic acid (e.g., Ad-36 nucleic acid) is administered to a subject, are also described. B.

Nutritional Supplements In other embodiments, the present invention provides nutritional supplements (e.g., energy bars or meal replacement bars or beverages) comprising a nutraceutical agents. The nutritional supplement may serve as meal or snack replacement and generally provide nutrient calories. Preferably, the nutritional supplements provide carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in balanced amounts. The nutritional supplement can further comprise carbohydrate, simple, medium chain length, or polysaccharides, or a combination thereof. A simple sugar can be chosen for desirable organoleptic properties. Uncooked cornstarch is one example of a complex carbohydrate. If it is desired that it should maintain its high molecular weight structure, it should be included only in food formulations or portions thereof which are not cooked or heat processed since the heat will break down the complex carbohydrate into simple carbohydrates, wherein simple carbohydrates are mono- or disaccharides. The nutritional supplement contains, in one embodiment, combinations of sources of carbohydrate of three levels of chain length (simple, medium and complex; e.g., sucrose, maltodextrins, and uncooked cornstarch). Sources of protein to be incorporated into the nutritional supplement of the invention can be any suitable protein utilized in nutritional formulations and can include whey protein, whey protein concentrate, whey powder, egg, soy flour, soy milk soy protein, soy protein isolate, caseinate (e.g., sodium caseinate, sodium calcium caseinate, calcium caseinate, potassium caseinate), animal and vegetable protein and mixtures thereof. When choosing a protein source, the biological value of the protein should be considered first, with the highest biological values being found in caseinate, whey, lactalbumin, egg albumin and whole egg proteins. In a preferred embodiment, the protein is a combination of whey protein concentrate and calcium caseinate. These proteins have high biological value; that is, they have a high proportion of the essential amino acids. See Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease, eighth edition, Lea & Febiger, publishers, 1986, especially Volume 1, pages 30-32. The nutritional supplement can also contain other ingredients, such as one or a combination of other vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, fiber and other dietary supplements (e.g., protein, amino acids, choline, lecithin, omega-3 fatty acids). Selection of one or several of these ingredients is a matter of formulation, design, consumer preference and end-user. The amounts of these ingredients added to the dietary supplements of this invention are readily known to the skilled artisan.

EXAMPLES Example 1 A sports drink containing NGNA was formulated for use by humans. The NGNA was made from glucosamine residues derived from crab chitin. The finished drink (per 500 ml bottle) contained: pure water; 1% Glycerol/(0.1-10%); lemon flavor; potassium sorbate/sodium benzoate as stabilizers; and 2 mg of 99% pure NGNA. Example 2 The sports drink described in Example 1 was tested in a group of 18 subjects. The subjects were supplied one 500 ml bottle of the sport drink containing 2 mg NGNA. The drink was administered during exercise or during the day when not exercising over an eight week period. The subjects worked out an average of about four times per week. The following measurements were taken during the study: fett/fat %, vekt/weight, overarm/upper arm in cm, midje/waist in cm, lår/thighs in cm. These results are summarized in FIG. 1A. As can be seen, there was a steady decrease in weight during the study (FIG. 1B). The subjects were also asked to evaluate other physiological effects of the drink. The subjects were asked to rank the impact of the drink on a scale of 0 to 9 (with 9 being a positive impact) with respect to the following questions: a. How was your workout today b. How do you feel? c. Do you have a cold 0, or are you healthy 9? d. Do you feel the drink helps you? e. How is workout energy and joy? f. Do you like the sport drink? The results are presented in FIGS. 2a-f, respectively. As can be seen, there were positive responses for well-being, colds, and energy/workout joy.
