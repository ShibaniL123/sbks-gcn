Example 116A
Methyl 4-{[(6-bromo-3-cyano-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo [2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
At RT, 75 mg (0.34 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, 161 mg (0.43 mmol) of HATU and 0.15 ml (0.85 mmol) of DIPEA were added in succession to a solution of 100 mg (0.28 mmol) of the compound from Example 115A in 1.0 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, the mixture, without further work-up, was purified directly by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 75 mg (51% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
