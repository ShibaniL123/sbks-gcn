Step 3: ([1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl] (d2)methyl) [(5-methylpyrimidin-2-yl)methyl]amine
To a solution of [1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](d2)methanamine [Example 2 Step 10] (1 g, 3.75 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in DMF (15 mL) was added 2-(bromomethyl)-5-methylpyrimidine [Example 12, Step 2] (700 mg, 3.76 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and TEA (569.64 mg, 5.64 mmol, 1.50 equiv). The resulting solution was stirred overnight at 25° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of H2O (40 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×50 mL). The organic layers were washed with water (3×20 mL) and brine (3×20 mL). The mixture was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by Prep-HPLC with the following: Column,)(Bridge Prep OBD C18 Column Sum, 30×150 mm; mobile phase, Water (10 mmol/L NH4HCO3) and ACN (25% ACN up to 55% in 7 min); Detector, UV 254/220 nm to afford 130 mg (8.7%) of ([1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]-4-fluoropiperidin-4-yl](d2)methyl)[(5-methylpyrimidin-2-yl)methyl]amine as a white solid.
