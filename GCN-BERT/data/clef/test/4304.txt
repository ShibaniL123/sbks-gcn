The present invention relates to the field of decorative accessories, and more specifically an attachment arrangement and method of use of same to removeably attach a display element to a wearable element of a decorative accessory or to remove a display element from a wearable element of a decorative accessory and transfer it to another wearable element to form another decorative accessory. Background to the invention Jewellery has always been considered an important fashion item. The appearance of the jewellery item, characterised by the materials, shape and arrangement of the component parts of the jewellery item, is important as it is considered to reflect the personality and judgment of the wearer. Jewellery designs commonly include a decoration or display element such as a gemstone, which is set in a mount which positions and holds the display element on the body or wearable element of the item of jewellery. This display element is typically the most valuable component of the item of jewellery, although the body or wearable element is commonly made of precious material such as silver, gold or platinum. Custom -made jewellery has become popular and allows the wearer to help in the design of the jewellery in order to produce a piece of jewellery unique to them. This permits the wearer's personality to be more accurately reflected in the appearance of the item of jewellery. However, due to the expense involved in the purchase of items of jewellery, in particular due to the decoration or display element but perhaps also because of the material of the body or wearable element, many individuals are required to limit their jewellery collection to a small number of items. However, changing fashion trends and/or evolution of the wearer's individual style and tastes can result in jewellery items quickly becoming outdated or no longer fitting with the wearer's style. The additional expense associated with custom-made jewellery also limits the number of unique jewellery items that an individual can afford. It may be possible for the display element in an item of jewellery to be either exchanged for a different display element or inserted into a different jewellery item by removing the display element from its respective mount. However this requires specialised knowledge and must be performed by a trained jeweller which results in additional costs, and results in a new item of jewellery in which the display element is again fixed. These costs can be significant if the wearer regularly exchanges or transfers the display element to keep up with changing fashion, social, work or ethnic trends. A further disadvantage of regular exchanging or transferring of the display element is that the display element may become damaged which can reduce its value, and repeated handling of the display elements (which may include small gemstones) will increase the likelihood that of loss during exchange or transfer. Furthermore, manipulation of the mounting which holds the display element on the jewellery body can result in damage to the mounting requiring further costs to repair or to replace. Damage to the mounting if unnoticed could also result in the display element being dislodged and lost during wear. It is an object of an aspect of the present invention to obviate or at least mitigate the foregoing disadvantages of the exchange or transfer of the display element of an item of jewellery. It is another object of an aspect of the present invention to provide a robust, reliable and compact_attachment arrangement which allows the easy exchange of a display element of a decorative accessory for another display element. It is a further object of an aspect of the present invention to provide a robust, reliable and compact_attachment arrangement which allows the easy transfer of a display element from one decorative accessory to another decorative accessory. Further aims of the invention will become apparent from the following description. Summary of the invention According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a decorative accessory comprising: a wearable element; anda display element;wherein the display element is removeably attachable to the wearable element. As the display element is removeably attachable to the wearable element, it can be attached to the wearable element to form a decorative accessory which incorporates the display element and removed from the wearable element for attachment to another wearable element or to permit the attachment of an alternative display element. The resulting decorative accessory is robust and allows the easy transfer of the display element from one wearable element to another.

Brief description of the drawings There will now be described, by way of example only, various embodiments of the invention with reference to the drawings, of which: Figures 1A and 1B illustrate in schematic form a decorative accessory comprising a wearable element and a display element, according to an embodiment of the invention, prior to mounting the display element on the wearable element;Figure 2A to 2D illustrate in schematic form a method of mounting the display element on the wearable element of the decorative accessory shown in Figure 1 according to an embodiment of the invention;Figures 3A and 3B illustrate in schematic form a decorative accessory according to another embodiment of the invention.Figure 4A and 4B illustrate in schematic form a further alternative embodiment of the invention. Detailed description of preferred embodiments The term decorative accessory used herein may refer to any personal decorative item or adornment, not limited to brooches, rings, necklaces, pendants, earrings, bracelets, tie clips and cufflinks. Figures 1A and 1B show a decorative accessory 101 according to a first embodiment of the invention. The decorative accessory comprises a display element 103 and a wearable element 105. The display element 103 can be seen to comprise a gemstone 107 mounted on a first attachment member 109. The wearable element can be seen to comprise a body 111 and second attachment members 113. The second attachment members 113 are made from metal and are integral to the body 111 of the wearable element 105 which takes the form of a tie clip. The second attachment members 113 are a pair of axially aligned and opposed arms which are separated by a gap 115. The gap 115 is inclined relative to the horizontal axis of the arms and forms end faces 117 on the arms. A longitudinal axis of the gap 115 forms an angle, in this example 45 degrees, with an axis extending through the arms 113. The gap 115 and its longitudinal axis are in the plane of the arms and the angle is formed within in the plane. The end faces 116 and 117 are parallel. The first attachment member 109 is an elliptical cylinder, having a bore extending therethrough which defines apertures 119 at either end. In this embodiment the cylinder is made from metal although any rigid or preferably resilient material may be used. The first attachment member 109 is affixed to the gemstone 107 using a solder. The length d of cylinder 109 is longer than length D of the gap 115. Grooves 121 are provided in the arms of the second attachment members 113 to improve grip between the first attachment member109 and the second attachment members 113 which help to hold the first attachment member 109 and display element 103 in place. Corresponding projections (not shown) may be provided on a corresponding internal surface of the first attachment member 109 to further improve grip. While the first attachment member has been described as being preferably resilient, it may of course be relatively rigid, in which case the second attachment members may be relatively resilient instead. However, appropriate selections of dimensions etc. may permit both the first attachment member and the second attachment members to be rigid. Of course, as another alternative both the first attachment member and the second attachment members may be resilient. Furthermore, while the first attachment member is described as being affixed to the gemstone using a solder, this is merely an example and any other manner of affixing the gemstone to the first attachment member may be used, such as adhesive if the material is suitable. Alternatively, the first attachment member may instead comprise a crown which receives and fixes the gemstone in place. The crown may be unitary or may also be affixed to the display element. Figure 2A to 2D show schematically a method of constructing a decorative accessory in accordance with the first embodiment of the invention. The decorative accessory is similar to that described in Figure 1, and will be understood from Figure 1 and the accompanying description. The decorative accessory201 comprises a display element 203 and a wearable element 205. The display element 203 can be seen to comprise a gemstone 207 mounted on a first attachment member 209. The wearable element can be seen to comprise a body 211 and second attachment members 213. The second attachment members 213 are made from metal and are integral to the body 211 of the wearable element 205 which takes the form of a tie clip. The second attachment members 213 are a pair of axially aligned and opposed arms which are separated by a gap 215. The gap 215 is inclined relative to the horizontal axis of the arms and forms end faces 216 and 217 on the arms. A longitudinal axis of the gap 215 forms an angle, in this example 45 degrees, with an axis extending through the arms 213. The gap 215 and its longitudinal axis are in the plane of the arms and the angle is formed within in the plane. The end faces 216 and 217 are parallel. The first attachment member 209 is an elliptical cylinder, having a bore extending therethrough which defines apertures 219 at either end. In this embodiment the cylinder is made from plastic although any rigid or preferably resilient material may be used. The first attachment member 209 is affixed to the gemstone 207 in this example using an adhesive. The length d of cylinder 209 is longer than length D of the gap 215. As shown in Figure 2B, the first attachment member 209 and affixed gemstone 207 are orientated such that the end face 16 and an arm 213 are partially inserted into the aperture 219 of the first attachment member 209. Pressure is applied to the first attachment member 209 in order to slide the first attachment member 209 along end face 217 of the second attachment member 213 so that one arm is completely inserted through the bore extending through the first attachment member as shown in Figure 2C. As shown in Figure 2D the axis of the aperture 219 and the axis of the second attachment members 213 are now aligned and the first attachment member 209 is moved along the arms of the second attachment members 213 to a desired position. The length of the first attachment member 209 is longer than the length of the gap 215, although this need not necessarily be the case. The first attachment member 209 therefore bridges the gap 215 between the opposed arms of the second attachment members 213. Grooves 221 are provided in the arms of the second attachment members 213 to improve grip between the first attachment member 209 and the second attachment members 213 which help to hold the first attachment member 209 and display element 203 in place. Corresponding projections (not shown) may be provided on a corresponding internal surface of the first attachment member 209 to further improve grip. Once the first attachment member has been positioned in the desire location on the arms of the second attachment members 213 the grooves 221 retain the position of the first attachment member 209 relative to the second attachment members 213. While the first attachment member has been described as being relatively resilient, it may of course be relatively rigid, in which case the second attachment members may be relatively resilient instead. However, appropriate selections of dimensions etc. may permit both the first attachment member and the second attachment members to be relatively rigid. Of course, as another alternative both the first attachment member and the second attachment members may be relatively resilient. Furthermore, while in this example the first attachment member is described as being affixed to the gemstone using an adhesive, this is merely an example and any other manner of affixing the gemstone to the first attachment member may be used. For example, the first attachment member may instead comprise a crown which receives and fixes the gemstone in place. The foregoing description relates to a method for constructing a decorative accessory. It will be appreciated that the principles of the invention may be used in a method of replacing a display element from a decorative accessory. In particular, the example methodology, or a subset thereof, may be reversed. For example, the display element 203 of the decorative accessory shown in Figure 2D may be replaced by orientating and manipulating the first attachment member such that it passes through the gap 215 and detaches from the second attachment members 213. By performing the above described method (or selected steps thereof) in reverse, the advantages described with reference to the relatively easy attachment of a display element to a wearable element are experienced in a detachment operation. With reference to Figure 2C, with the axis of the aperture 219 and the axis of the second attachment members 213 aligned, the first attachment member 209 is moved along the arms of the second attachment members 213 to a distal end of one of the attachment members 213. With reference to Figure 2B, the first attachment member 209 and affixed gemstone 207 may then be orientated by the application of pressure to the resilient first attachment member 209 such that the first attachment member 209 is removed from the other second attachment member 213. The display element is thus relatively easily detached from the wearable element. Subsequently, a second display element (not shown) having a similar or corresponding first attachment member may be attached to the wearable element 205 by following steps illustrated in Figures 2A to 2D. Alternatively, the display element 203 once detached from the wearable element 205 may be attached to a second wearable element (not shown) having second attachment members by following equivalent steps to those illustrated in Figures 2A to 2D. Further alternatively, the display element 203 once detached from the wearable element 205 may be attached to a second wearable element such as described below with reference to Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3A and 3B show a decorative accessory 301 according to another embodiment of the invention. The decorative accessory comprises a display element 303 and a wearable element 305. The display element 303 can be seen to comprise a gemstone 307 mounted on a first attachment member 309. The wearable element can be seen to comprise a body 311 and second attachment members 313. The second attachment members 313 are made from hard plastic although any resilient material may be used and are integral to the body 311 of the wearable element 305 which takes the form of a cuff link. The second attachment members 313 are a pair of axially aligned and opposed arms which are separated by a gap 315. The gap 315 is inclined relative to the vertical axis of the arms and forms end faces 317 on the arms. A longitudinal axis of the gap 315 forms an angle, in this example 45 degrees, with an axis extending through the arms 313. The gap 315 and its longitudinal axis are in the plane of the arms and the angle is formed within in the plane. The end faces 316 and 317 are parallel. Note that in this embodiment the plane through the arms 313 has effectively been rotated through 90 degrees relative to the wearable element and relative to the embodiments described above. The first attachment member 309 is an elliptical cylinder, having a bore extending therethrough which defines apertures 319 at either end. In this embodiment the cylinder is made from metal although any rigid material may be used. The first attachment member 309 is affixed to the gemstone 307 using an adhesive. The length of the cylinder 309 is equivalent to the length of the gap 315. While the first attachment member 309 has been described as being rigid, it may of course be relatively resilient, in which case the second attachment members may be relatively rigid instead. However, appropriate selections of dimensions etc. may permit both the first attachment member and the second attachment members to be relatively rigid. Of course, as another alternative both the first attachment member and the second attachment members may be resilient. Furthermore, while the first attachment member is described as being affixed to the gemstone using an adhesive, this is merely an example and any other manner of affixing the gemstone to the first attachment member may be used. For example, the first attachment member may instead comprise a crown which receives and fixes the gemstone in place. Figure 3B shows the display element 303 attached to the wearable element 305. The first attachment member 309 is able to move along the arms of the second attachment members 313 as the axis of the throughbore the first attachment member 309 is aligned with the axis of the arms of the second attachment members 313.. The length of the first attachment member 309 is equivalent to the length of the gap 315. The first attachment member 309 therefore bridges the gap 315 between the opposed arms of the second attachment members 313. The first attachment member 309 and affixed display element 303 are held securely on the second attachment members 313 of the wearable element 305. Figure 4A and 4B show a decorative accessory 401 according to another embodiment of the invention. The decorative accessory comprises a display element 403 and a wearable element 405. The display element 403 can be seen to comprise a gemstone 407 mounted on a first attachment member 409. The wearable element can be seen to comprise a body 411 and second attachment members 413. The second attachment members 413 are made from metal and are integral to the body 411 of the wearable element 405 which takes the form of a ring. The second attachment members 413 are a pair of axially aligned and opposed arms which are separated by a gap. The gap is inclined relative to the horizontal axis of the arms and forms end faces on the arms. As in previous embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the gap forms an angle, in this example 45 degrees, with an axis extending through the arms 413. The gap and its longitudinal axis are in the plane of the arms and the angle is formed within in the plane. The end faces are parallel. The first attachment member 409 is an elliptical cylinder, having a bore extending therethrough which defines apertures 419 at either end. In this embodiment the cylinder is made from a resilient plastic although any resilient material may be used. The first attachment member 409 is affixed to the gemstone 407 using a crown which receives and fixes the gemstone in place. The length of cylinder 409 is preferably equivalent to the length of the gap. While the first attachment member 409 has been described as being resilient, it may of course be a rigid formation, in which case the second attachment members may be resilient instead. However, appropriate selections of dimensions etc. may permit both the first attachment member and the second attachment members to be rigid. Of course, as another alternative both the first attachment member and the second attachment members may be resilient. Furthermore, while the first attachment member is described as being affixed to the gemstone using a crown which receives and fixes the gemstone in place this is merely an example and any other manner of affixing the gemstone to the first attachment member may be used. For example, the first attachment member may instead be affixed to the gemstone using adhesive. Figure 4B shows the display element 403 attached to the wearable element 405. The first attachment member 409 is able to move along the arms of the second attachment members 413 as the axis of the throughbore the first attachment member 409 is aligned with the axis of the arms of the second attachment members 413. The length of the first attachment member 409 is preferably equivalent to the length of the gap 415. The first attachment member 409 therefore bridges the gap 415 between the opposed arms of the second attachment members 413. The first attachment member 409 and affixed display element 403 are held securely on the second attachment members 413 of the wearable element 405. The described embodiments of the invention use an elliptical cylinder as a first attachment member. However, the present invention may also use first attachment members of different shapes and dimensions. While the angle of the gap in the embodiments herein described is 45 degrees relative to the arms, any angle may be adopted. The described embodiments of the invention describe that the first attachment member having a bore extending therethrough is located on the display element and the second attachment member having arms are located on the wearable element. However, the present invention may also describe the first attachment member having a bore extending therethrough is located on the wearable element and the second attachment means having arms is located on the display element. The present invention in its various aspects provides a decorative accessory, attachment arrangements and methods of use. The resulting decorative accessory is robust and allows the user to easily transfer a display element from one wearable element to another wearable element. The decorative accessory may also facilitate the easy replacement of one display element for another display element on the wearable element. The decorative accessory allows the user to customise their accessory collection and update the style of accessory with changing fashion, work, social and ethnic trends without incurring high expense. The invention provides decorative accessories, attachment arrangements and methods of use. The decorative accessories comprise a wearable element and a display element. The display element is configured to be removeably attachable to the wearable element. Throughout the specification, unless the context demands otherwise, the terms "comprise" or "include", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", "includes" or "including" will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers, but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers. Various modifications to the above-described embodiments may be made within the scope of the invention, and the invention extends to combinations of features other than those expressly claimed herein. For example, as described above, a cylindrical first attachment member might be provided on the wearable element and the pair of opposed, spaced apart arms might be provided on the display element.
