t CA 02746082 2011-07-12 TOBACCO FILLER WITH CONVEYOR FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a cigarette manufacturing machine and more particularly, relates to a cigarette manufacturing machine designed for residential use. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The manufacturer of cigarettes is conventionally carried out on high capacity machines operating in factories. These cigarettes are packaged in packages of 20 or cigarettes (although other sizes are known) and distributed through local stores. A package of cigarettes is relatively expensive as they are subject to high taxes. Some individuals prefer to roll their own cigarettes from tobacco and a cigarette paper. The original roll your own cigarettes were formed by tobacco placed on a paper and then the paper was rolled around the paper to form the cigarette. An adhesive strip on the cigarette paper maintains the desired form. Subsequently, previously formed empty tubes, (generally with a filter) were manufactured and the loose tobacco was then inserted into the tube to form the cigarette. In order to assist in the forming, some small machines appeared on the market and which machines were designed to use the empty cigarette tubes with the tobacco subsequently being inserted therein. Generally, such machines were limited to a single cigarette at a time. There have been more recent proposals for residential cigarette machines which would be able to form a plurality of cigarettes in a single operation. Some problems associated with such residential cigarette machines is the ability to maintain a consistent tobacco weight and density in the individual cigarettes. When the CA 02746082 2011-07-12 density and tobacco weight are not suitable, the tobacco is either too dense producing a cigarette which is more difficult to smoke or if too light, one lacking flavour. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improvements in cigarette manufacturing machines to permit the uniform loading of tobacco into a cigarette tube. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Having thus generally described the invention, reference will be made to the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 illustrates a device for the loading of cigarette tubes into a magazine; Figure 2 is a perspective pneumatic view illustrating the loading of empty cigarette tubes from a tube magazine to a tube holder; and Figure 3 is a side sectional view illustrating the transfer of tobacco from a hopper to the dies. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION One cigarette manufacturing machine which is suitable for residential use is illustrated in PCT Application No. CA2010/001984, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. This machine is one wherein the tobacco is filled into an empty cigarette tube. Referring to the drawings in greater detail and by reference characters thereto, there is illustrated in Figure 1 an arrangement for transferring cigarette tubes from a container to a magazine. In this respect, the tubes come in a box 12 having a cover 14. In order to transfer the empty cigarette tubes, cover 14 is opened and a scoop 16 is placed on CA 02746082 2011-07-12 top thereof. The box is then inverted and placed over a magazine 15. The scoop 16 is then removed and the cigarette tubes enter into carriage 26. Carriage 26 includes a shaker 18 which includes a spring shaker 20. Carriage 26 also includes a slide mechanism 22 and a pusher rod 24. Carriage 26 has room for a predefined number of cigarette tubes 30. In the illustrated embodiment, carriage 26 is designed to receive 5 cigarette tubes. During movement of carriage 26, a retaining member 28 is arranged to prevent any further cigarette tubes 30 from being discharged. Retaining member 28 may be of any desired form and could comprise a small cylinder to drive a piston. As shown in Figure 3, there is provided an arrangement for loading and compacting the loose tobacco. In this arrangement, a preset amount of tobacco 34, is placed on top of a conveyor belt 36 which is entrained about shafts 38 and Conveyor belt 36 is designed to transfer the cut tobacco from the loading area through 90 degrees downwardly to dies for forming and cutting the loose tobacco. There is provided a further tensioning belt 44 entrained about shafts 46 and 48. Belt 44 is flexible while a back plate 50 is provided to limit the amount of movement of belt 44. As seen in the Figures, when the belts are started, the tobacco is transferred and tensioning belt 44 is forced towards back plate 50. Between the two belts, the tobacco becomes compacted to the desired degree. It will be understood that the above embodiment is for purposes of illustration only and that changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
