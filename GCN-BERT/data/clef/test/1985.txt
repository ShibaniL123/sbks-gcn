Example 355A
Ethyl {5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-6-[(2-oxoimidazolidin-1-yl)methyl]-1-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-1,4-dihydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-3(2H)-yl}acetate
To a solution of 218 mg (2.54 mmol) of imidazolidin-2-one in 6 ml of DMF were added 101 mg (2.54 mmol) of sodium hydride (60% suspension in mineral oil), then the mixture was heated to 60° C. for 5 min and subsequently cooled back down to RT (“Solution 1”). To a solution of 250 mg (0.634 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 306A in 5 ml of dichloromethane in another reaction vessel were added, at 0° C., 221 μl (1.27 mmol) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and 49 μl (0.666 mmol) of thionyl chloride. After stirring at 0° C. for 20 min, Solution 1 was added in portions and then the cooling bath was removed. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for about 18 h. All the volatile constituents were then removed on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was separated into its components by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8). After concentration of the product fractions and drying under high vacuum, 87 mg (28% of theory, 97% purity) of the title compound were obtained.
