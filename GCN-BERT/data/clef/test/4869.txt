NON-GELATIN ENTERIC SOFT CAPSULES CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/792,521, filed March 15, 2013, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD Described herein are pharmaceutical enteric soft capsules that do not contain gelatin as a film-forming polymer. In particular, compositions and methods for manufacturing enteric soft capsules comprising carrageenans as film forming polymers are described. BACKGROUND Carrageenan is a natural hydrocolloid, more particularly a polysaccharide hydrocolloid, which is derived from edible red seaweed, particularly of the species Rhodophyceae. Carrageenan is a carbohydrate polymer of repeating galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose (sugar) units that is linear and without significant numbers of branches or substitutions. Most, if not all, of the galactose units on a carrageenan molecule possess a sulfated ester group. The exact position of the sulfate groups, the cations on the sulfate groups, and the possible presence of an anhydrous bridge on the molecule differentiate the various types of carrageenan. The molecules are large and highly flexible and can form helical structures. This gives them the ability to form gels at ambient temperatures. A need has arisen in recent years for gelatin-alternatives for soft capsule manufacturing. This need was driven primarily by the identification of Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis (BSE) in cattle, a primary source of gelatin used in soft capsules. In addition, vegetarians and consumers with religious restrictions on consuming materials of animal origin have further heightened the need to develop animal-free soft capsules. Animal-free soft capsules have been developed as described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2005/004840 and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,214,376; 6,949,256; and 7,887,838, each of which is fully incorporated by reference herein for such teachings. While such soft gel technologies are useful for gastric delivery, there remains a need for an enteric non-gelatin soft capsule technology. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop an enteric soft capsule that comprises carrageenans as film-forming agents in place of gelatin. This permits the manufacture of animal-free enteric soft capsules.

The amount of alkali is adjusted to give a final pH value of the gel mass less than or equal to about pH 9.0. In one embodiment, the final pH does not exceed 8.5. In one embodiment the volatile alkali neutralizing agent, ammonia, is preferred. The film-forming polymer(s) and filler can be combined with the plasticizer and solvent and then blended with the acid-insoluble gel to make a final homogeneous mix in a heat-controlled vessel and can be degassed by using vacuum. The fugitive ammonia evaporates during degassing. Using the foregoing process, the alkali concentrations do not require an additional step such as neutralizing with acid in order to neutralize the gel mass. In another embodiment described herein, the enteric soft capsule shell can be made by using an aqueous dispersion of the acid-insoluble polymer by adding alkaline materials such as ammonium, sodium, or potassium hydroxides, other alkalis, or a combination thereof that will cause the enteric acid-insoluble polymer to dissolve. The plasticizer-wetted, film-forming polymer(s) and filler can then be mixed with the solution of the acid-insoluble polymer. In one embodiment, enteric acid-insoluble polymers in the form of salts of the above-mentioned bases or alkalis can be dissolved directly in water and mixed with the plasticizer-wetted, film-forming polymer. In one embodiment described herein, the enteric soft capsule has the composition of Table 1, including all possible iterations of the specified ranges that provide 100% for the total weight percentage, including or excluding the optional sealants, colorings, flavorings, or excipients.

In some embodiments, the sorbitol can be substituted with com syrup or malatol (e.g., Lycasin®; hydrogenated glucose syrup). In other embodiments described herein, the hydroxypropyl starch phosphate can be substituted with pea, potato, or com starch. In some embodiments, the starch is a modified starch. The enteric soft capsule composition can optionally include one or more additives such as sealants, opacifiers, preservatives, flavorings, colorings, or other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and the like. Another embodiment described herein provides an enteric acid-insoluble polymer dispersed within the film-forming polymer gel mass that provides the total soft gel composition with enteric acid-insoluble properties, at relatively low concentrations of the enteric acid-insoluble polymer (e.g., from about 8% to about 20% of the total wet gel mass composition) and without the need of excessive amounts of alkali, thus avoiding denaturation or degradation of the film-forming polymer that can weaken the integrity of the enteric soft capsule shell. Films of the enteric soft capsule shell do not dissolve or disintegrate in acids, such as 0.1 Ν hydrochloric acid or simulated gastric fluid (ca. pH 1.2), despite the fact that the majority of the shell ingredients (i.e., greater than 50%) normally dissolve in, or are miscible with, acids. Enteric soft capsules made using the compositions described herein remain intact in hydrochloric acid or simulated gastric fluid for at least two hours. The capsules readily release the contents upon shifting the pH of the solution to ca. 6.8, such as that of simulated intestinal fluid. In another embodiment described herein, the final enteric capsule composition provides films of increased strength without substantially compromising film elasticity. Moreover, films made from the enteric soft capsule compositions as described herein can be sealed at normal temperature range typically used for making traditional soft gel capsules. In one aspect, enteric soft capsules are made using a rotary die apparatus as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,459,983; 5,146,730; and 6,482,516, each of which are incorporated by reference herein for such teachings. Another embodiment described herein includes a process of manufacturing enteric soft capsules comprising the pharmaceutical composition as described herein.

Alternatively, the gel mass can also be cooled to between 5-30 °C, and then ground into pellets of 0.125 in (3.175 mm) to 0.75 in (19.05 mm). The cooled and ground gel mass pellets were fed to extruders via volumetric feeders. Ribbons were formed via film extrusion. The formed ribbons were fed to a rotary die encapsulation machine to form soft gel capsules. Compared to gelatin capsules, the wedge and drum temperatures wre much higher (>75 °C). The seam formation takes place via adhesion. The formed capsules were dried in a tumbling dryer for between 15-90 minutes, and then dried on trays in a temperature/humidity controlled tunnel for between 12-96 hours. Finished capsules can withstand USP paddle disintegration tests in acidic media (pH 1.2) for at least 2 hours and release active agents in buffered media (pH 6.8).
