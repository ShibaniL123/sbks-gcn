METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING A SUBTERRANEAN FORMATION WITH SALT-TOLERANT CEMENT SLURRIES CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to provisional application number 61/755,604 filed on January 23, 2013 and titled "Methods and Compositions for Treating a Subterranean Formation with Salt-Tolerant Cement Slurries" and also to provisional application number 61/707,128 filed on September 28, 2012, and titled "Methods for Treating a Subterranean Formation with Salt-Tolerant Cement Compositions." BACKGROUND [0002] The embodiments herein relate to methods and compositions for treating a subterranean formation with salt-tolerant cement slurries. [0003] Various methods are known for completing a subterranean formation in order to recover hydrocarbons, natural gas, or other extractable substances from the formation (e.g., open-hole completions, liner completions, cased hole completions, etc.). During many completion operations, a casing is inserted into a drilled well and a cement slurry is pushed through the bottom of the casing and out through an annulus between the outer casing wall and the formation face. The cement slurry then cures in the annular space, thereby forming a sheath of hardened, substantially impermeable cement (a "cement sheath") that, inter alia, supports and positions the casing in the wellbore and bonds the exterior surface of the casing to the subterranean formation. Among other things, the cement sheath surrounding the casing serves to prevent contamination of non-hydrocarbon zones from contacting the produced hydrocarbons. For example, the cement sheath may keep fresh water zones from becoming contaminated with produced fluids or gases from within the casing. The cement sheath may also prevent unstable formations from caving in, thereby reducing the chance of a stuck drill pipe or a casing collapse. Finally, the cement sheath forms a solid barrier to prevent fluid loss or contamination of production zones. The degree of success of a completion operation (e.g., fracturing and fluid recovery) therefore depends, at least in part, upon the adequate cementing of the wellbore casing. [0004] Salt formations are encountered in many oil-producing regions. Salt formations, particularly those containing, but not limited to, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium monovalent and divalent cations (e.g., Na+, Κ+, Ca+, and Mg+), may interfere with the ability of traditional cement slurries to form a satisfactory cement sheath. The cations from the salt formation may creep into, contaminate, and chemically react with the cement slurry. For example, divalent cations may viscosify (or gel) the cement slurry, altering the setting properties and thus the final mechanical strength of the cement slurry, often resulting in improper zonal isolation and/or casing collapses. Traditional cement slurries are unable to thwart the effects of salt contamination while still maintaining the desired cementing properties. Therefore, a cement slurry composition and a method of preparing said cement slurry that is capable of mitigating or eliminating the gelling effects of salt contamination for use in oil-producing regions with salt formations, without compromising the cement slurry’s cementing capabilities (e.g., complete zonal isolation) would be beneficial to one of ordinary skill in the art.

The subject matter disclosed is capable of considerable modifications, alterations, combinations, and equivalents in form and function, as will occur to those skilled in ) the art and having the benefit of this disclosure. [0006] FIG. 1 depicts an embodiment of a system configured for delivering the salt-tolerant cement slurries of the embodiments described herein to a downhole location. DETAILED DESCRIPTION 25 [0007] The embodiments herein relate to methods and compositions for treating a subterranean formation with salt-tolerant cement slurries. Specifically, the embodiments herein relate to compatibility studies used to develop cement slurries that are compatible with salts, such as sodium salts, potassium salts, magnesium salts, calcium salts, and any combination thereof. [0008] Traditional cement slurries for use in cementing downhole casings are typically not salt-tolerant. Thus, salt contamination of the cement slurries may result in improper functioning of the cement slurry and lead to compromised or poor recovery of produced fluids or gases during oil well production. The embodiments herein relate to methods for treating a subterranean formation with salt-tolerant cement slurries that mitigate or eliminate the effects of salt contamination in salt formation zones. As used herein, the term "salt-tolerant cement slurry" refers to a cement slurry that is capable of substantially maintaining its cement sheath integrity upon salt contamination. Among other reasons, because the salt-tolerant cement slurries described herein are more elastic and resilient than traditional cement slurries, they are able to resist deformation due to salt creeping. Moreover, the properties of the salt-tolerant cement slurries of (e.g., thickening time and compressive strength) may remain essentially unchanged after salt contamination. [0009] The rheological properties of a cement slurry determines the slurry's gellation, flowability, and stability and, ultimately, its end-use performance. A cement slurry that is salt-tolerant must therefore also possess the appropriate rheological properties to perform its required cementing functions. A cement slurry is generally considered adequate for use in subterranean operations and sufficiently pumpable when it exhibits a plastic viscosity ("PV") of less than about 500 cP and a yield point ("YP") of less than about 200 lb/100ft2, as defined by the conventional Bingham Plastic viscosity model. In some embodiments, the salt-tolerant cement slurry of the embodiments described herein has a PV of less than about 500 cP and a YP of less than about 30 lb/100ft2. In other embodiments, the salt-tolerant cement slurry of the embodiments herein has a PV in the range of a lower limit of about 120 cP, 140 cP, 160 cP, 180 cP, 200 cP, 220 cP, 240 cP, 260 cP, 280 cP, and 300 cP to an upper limit of about 500 cP, 480 cP, 460 cP, 440 cP, 420 cP, 400 cP, 380 cP, 360 cP, 340 cP, 320 cP, and 300 cP and a YP in the range of a lower limit of about 5 lb/100ft2, 25 lb/100ft2, 50 lb/100ft2, 75 lb/100ft2, and 100 lb/100ft2 to an upper limit of about 200 lb/100ft2, 175 lb/100ft2, 150 lb/100ft2, 125 lb/10Oft2, and 100 lb/100ft2. [0010] In some embodiments, method of treating subterranean formation having sodium salts, potassium salts, magnesium salts, calcium salts, or any combination thereof is provided. The methods use the salt-tolerant cement slurry compositions disclosed herein comprising: a base fluid; a cementitious material; a pozzolanic material; an elastomer; a weight additive; a strengthening agent; a dispersant; a salt-tolerant fluid loss additive; a fluid loss intensifier; and a salt additive. In some embodiments, the salt-tolerant cement slurry compositions further comprise a defoaming agent. In some embodiments, the methods of the embodiments described herein include introducing the salt-tolerant cement slurry into a salt-containing subterranean formation, and setting it therein to form a hardened mass. I. BASE FLUID [OOll] Any aqueous base fluid suitable for use in a subterranean operation (e.g., drilling or completion operations) may be used in the salt-tolerant cement slurry of the disclosed herein. Suitable base fluids may include, but are not limited to freshwater, saltwater (e.g., water containing one or more salts dissolved therein), brine (e.g., saturated saltwater), seawater, and any combination thereof. Generally, the base fluid may be from any source, provided, for example, that it does not contain an excess of compounds that may undesirably affect other components in the salt-tolerant cement slurry. In some embodiments, the base fluid may be included in an amount sufficient to form a pumpable slurry. Generally, the base fluid is added to balance the remaining ingredients rather than in a certain weight percentage. However, in some embodiments, the base fluid may be included in the salt-tolerant cement slurries in an amount in the range of a lower limit of about 30% by weight ("w/w"), 40% w/w, 50% w/w, 60% w/w, 70% w/w, 80% w/w, 90% w/w, 100% w/w, 110% w/w, and 120% w/w to an upper limit of about 200% w/w, 190% w/w, 180% w/w, 170% w/w, 160% w/w, 150% w/w, 140% w/w, 130% w/w, and 120% w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. In some embodiments, the base fluid may be included in an amount of about 30% to about 150% w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. II. CEMENTITIOUS MATERIAL [0012] The cementitious material may be any cementitious material suitable for use in subterranean operations. In preferred embodiments, the cementitious material is a hydraulic cement. Hydraulic cements harden by the process of hydration due to chemical reactions to produce insoluble hydrates (e.g., calcium hydroxide) that occur independent of the cement's water content (e.g., hydraulic cements can harden even under constantly damp conditions). Thus, hydraulic cements are preferred because they are capable of hardening regardless of the water content of a particular subterranean formation. Suitable hydraulic cements include, but are not limited to Portland cement; Portland cement blends (e.g., Portland blast-furnace slag cement and/or expansive cement); non-Portland hydraulic cement (e.g., super-sulfated cement, calcium aluminate cement, and/or high magnesium-content cement); and any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the cementitious material may be present in an amount ranging from a lower level of at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or 35% to an upper level of equal to or less than about 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, 40%, or 35%, wherein each of the percentages are w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. In preferred embodiments, the cementitious material may be present in an amount of about 30% to about 60% w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. III. POZZOLANIC MATERIAL [0013] The pozzolanic material may aid in increasing the density and strength of the cementitious material. As used herein the term "pozzolanic material" refers to a siliceous material that, while not being cementitious, is capable of reacting with calcium hydroxide (which may be produced during hydration of a cementitious material) in the presence of water to form a material possessing the qualities of cementitious material. Because calcium hydroxide accounts for a sizable portion of most hydrated hydraulic cements and because calcium hydroxide does not contribute to the cement's properties, the combination of cementitious and pozzolanic materials may synergistically enhance the strength and quality of the cement. Any pozzolanic material that is reactive with the cementitious material may be used in the methods and compositions of the embodiments described herein. Suitable pozzolanic materials include, but are not limited to silica fume, metakaolin, fly ash, diatomaceous earth, calcined or uncalcined diatomite, calcined fullers earth, pozzolanic clays, calcined or uncalcined volcanic ash, bagasse ash, pumice, pumicite, rice hull ash, natural and synthetic zeolites, slag, vitreous calcium aluminosilicate, and any combination thereof. Preferred pozzolanic materials may include, but are not limited to, silica fume, fly ash, and slag, as they are particularly reactive. An example of a suitable commercially-available pozzolanic material is POZMIX®-A available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. of Houston, ΤΧ. In some embodiments, the pozzolanic material may be present in an amount ranging from a lower level of at least about 0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, or 30%, to an upper level of equal to or less than about 40%, 35%, or 30%, wherein each of the percentages are w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. IV. ELASTOMER [0014] In some embodiments, the salt-tolerant cement slurry disclosed herein further comprises an elastomer. The elastomers may be used to impart elasticity to the cement sheath of the salt-tolerant cement slurry, thereby potentially counteracting possible stresses that may be encountered by the cement due to creeping of a salt zone. In some embodiments, the elastomers may swell upon contact with water and/or oil (e.g., up to 500% of their original size). Such swelling may aid in maintaining zonal isolation in salt formations, for example, by swelling when contacted with water and/or oil to seal vulnerable spaces or cracks in the cement sheath. In preferred embodiments, the elastomer swells upon contact with oil. The elastomers may additionally be weighted using a weighting agent. Weighting agents are typically materials that weigh more than water and may be used to increase the density of a cement slurry. Suitable weighting may include, but are not limited to, hematite, hausmannite, barite, sand, Mn02, and any combination thereof. Examples of commercially-available heavy weight elastomers are WellLife®-930 and WellLife®-987, available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. of Houston, ΤΧ. Suitable swellable and weighted elastomers and their methods of use can be found in U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2011/0028593, filed July 29, 2009, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. [0015] Generally, the elastomers of the embodiments herein may be used in particulate form. As used herein, the term "particulate" refers to materials in solid state having a well-defined physical shape, including regular and irregular geometries. Elastomers may have the shape of, for example, platelets, shavings, fibers, flakes, ribbons, rods, strips, spheroids, hollow beads, toroids, pellets, tablets, or any other physical shape. Suitable elastomers may include, but are not limited to, polypropylene, polyethylene, styrene divinyl benzene, polyisoprene, polybutadiene, polyisobutylene, polyurethane, a styrene-butadiene random copolymer, a styrene-butadiene block copolymer, acrylonitrile butadiene, acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene, and any combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the elastomer material may be present in an amount ranging from a lower level of at least about 0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 1%, 2%, 4%, 8%, or 10% to an upper level of equal to or less than about 20%, 18%, 16%, 14%, 12%, or 10%, wherein each of the percentages are w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. V. WEIGHT ADDITIVE [0016] Weight additives suitable may be used to increase the density of the salt-tolerant cement slurry such that the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the salt-tolerant cement slurry is balanced against the formation pore pressure to stabilize the strength and permeability (e.g., salt contamination) of the cement. Weight additives are high-specific gravity solid particulates and may include, but are not limited to, hausmannite ore, barite, hermatite (Fe203), calcium carbonate, siderite (FeC03), ilmenite (FeOTi02), and any combinations thereof. Any weighting agent suitable for use with the elastomers described herein may additionally be used as a weight additive. Examples of commercially-available weight additives suitable for use in the embodiments described herein may include, but are not limited to MICROMAX® and Fli-Dense® No. 4, available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. of Houston, ΤΧ. Another example of a commercially-available weight additive suitable may include, but is not limited to, BARIMITE™, available from CIMBAR Performance Minerals in Cartersville, GA. [0017] Typically, the density of the weight additives of the of the embodiments disclosed herein range from about 1.05 g/cm3 to about 5.5 g/cm3. For example, calcium carbonate has a minimum specific gravity of about 2.7 g/cm3 and hematite has a minimum specific gravity of about 5.1 g/cm3. In some embodiments, the weighting agent may be present in an amount ranging from a lower level of at least about 0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 1%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, 14%, 18%, or 20% to an upper level of equal to or less than about 30%, 28%, 26%, 24%, 22%, or 20%, wherein each of the percentages are w/w of the complete dry cement composition. VI. STRENGTHENING AGENT [0018] In some embodiments, a strengthening agent may be added to the salt-tolerant cement slurry compositions. A strengthening agent may be used to aid in the stabilization and permeability of a cement at bottomhole temperature extremes, typically exceeding about 200°F. The strengthening agent may be capable of improving or enhancing low permeability and high compressive strength in a cement sheath by imparting resistance against high temperatures that often can cause stability degradation to cement. Typical strengthening agents may include, but are not limited to, silica flour and silica fume. Examples of commercially-available strengthening agents suitable for use in the embodiments described herein include, but are not limited to SSA-l™ and SSA-2™, available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. of Houston, ΤΧ. In some embodiments, the strengthening may be present in an amount ranging from a lower level of at least about 0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, or 30%, to an upper level of equal to or less than about 40%, 35%, or 30%, wherein each of the percentages are w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. VII. DISPERSANT [0019] Dispersants suitable for use in the embodiments described herein may affect the cement's rheological properties and reduce its apparent viscosity. The dispersant may thus allow turbulent flow to be achieved at lower pumping rates, resulting in reduced friction pressure during pumping. Additionally, adequately dispersed cement slurries exhibit improved fluid-loss control. Suitable dispersants for use in the salt-tolerant cement slurries may include, but are not limited to, sulfonated styrene maleic anhydride copolymer, sulfonated vinyltoluene maleic anhydride copolymer, sodium naphthalene sulfonate condensed with formaldehyde, sulfonated acetone condensed with formaldehyde, lignosulfonates and interpolymers of acrylic acid, allyloxybenzene sulfonate, allyl sulfonate and non-ionic monomers, and any combination thereof. An example of a suitable commercially available dispersant is CFR-3™ available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. of Houston, ΤΧ. In some embodiments, the dispersant may be present in an amount ranging from a lower level of at least about 0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, or 2%, to an upper level of equal to or less than about 4%, 3.5%, 3%, 2.5%, or 2%, wherein each of the percentages are w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. VIII. SALT-TOLERANT FLUID LOSS ADDITIVE [0020] "Fluid loss," as that term is used herein, refers to the undesirable migration or loss of fluids into a subterranean formation. Fluid loss may result in the build up of materials on the subterranean formation ("filter cake") inhibiting hydrocarbon production. Additionally, the loss of fluid from a cement slurry such as the salt-tolerant cement slurry disclosed herein may leach the necessary components to render the cement Theologically functional or salt-tolerant capable. Fluid loss additives lower the volume of a filtrate that passes through a filter medium. That is, they block the pore throats and spaces that otherwise allow a fluid to leak out of a desired zone and into an undesired zone. The salt-tolerant fluid loss additives may comprise an amphoteric copolymer including, but not limited to, an amphoteric copolymer of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid and diallyldimethylammonium chloride. In some embodiments, the salt-tolerant fluid loss additive may be present in an amount ranging from a lower level of at least about 0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1%, 1.2%, 1.4%, or 1.6%, to an upper level of equal to or less than about 3%, 2.8%, 2.6%, 2.4%, 2.2%, 2%, 1.8%, or 1.6% wherein each of the percentages are w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. In preferred embodiments, the salt-tolerant fluid loss additive may be present in an amount of about 0.2% to about 3% w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. IX. FLUID LOSS INTENSIFIER [0021] The fluid loss intensifier of some embodiments disclosed herein may operate synergistically with the salt-tolerant fluid loss additive to facilitate fluid loss control. Suitable fluid loss intensifiers may include, but are not limited to, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, Ν,Ν dimethyl acrylamide, acrylamide terpolymer, copolymers thereof, any derivatives thereof, and any combination thereof. Examples of suitable commercially-available fluid loss intensifiers for use in the salt-tolerant cement compositions of the embodiments described herein may include, but are not limited to, Halad®-413 and Halad®-862, available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. of Houston, ΤΧ. In some embodiments, the fluid loss intensifier may be present in an amount ranging from a lower level of at least about 0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, or 1% to an upper level of equal to or less than about 2%, 1.9%, 1.8%, 1.7%, 1.6%, 1.5%, 1.4%, 1.3%, 1.2% or 1% wherein each of the percentages are w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. X. SALT ADDITIVE [0022] The salt-tolerant cement slurries of the embodiments disclosed herein may further comprise a salt additive. The salt additive may serve a dual purpose. First, the salt additive may prevent the cement slurry from reacting with formation chemistries to form particularly damaging salt products (e.g., MgCI). Second, the presence of the salt additive may prevent further dissolution of formation salts due to the cement slurry having spent its reactive chemistries on the salt present. The salt additive may be any simple salt compatible with use in a subterranean formation. In preferred embodiments, the salt additive includes, but is not limited to sodium chloride and/or potassium chloride. In some embodiments, the salt additive may be present in an amount ranging from a lower level of at least about 15%, 18%, 20%, 22%, 24%, 26%, 28%, or 30%, to an upper level of equal to or less than about 40%, 38%, 36%, 34%, 32%, or 30% wherein each of the percentages are w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. In preferred embodiments, the salt additive may be present in an amount of about 18% to about 40% w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. In even more preferred embodiments, the salt additive may be present in an amount of about 36% w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. XI. DEFOAMING AGENT [0023] Defoaming agents suitable for use in the embodiments described herein may be used to prevent foaming of the salt-tolerant cement slurry and its components. The defoaming agents may be capable of eliminating trapped air and preventing the formation of entrained air that could compress down hole. Foaming is of a particular concern when salt contamination from the formation is likely because a cement slurry that has foamed may exhibit cracks or spaces for which the salt to easily enter; defoaming agents minimize or eliminate these spaces. Suitable defoaming agents for use in the embodiments disclosed herein may include, but are not limited to, octyl alcohols, aluminum stearates, glycols, silicone, sulfonated hydrocarbons, fatty alcohols, fatty acid soaps, fatty acid esters, ethylene bis stearamides, derivatives thereof, and any combination thereof. An example of a suitable commercially-available defoaming agent is D-AIR™ series of defoaming agents available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. of Flouston, ΤΧ. In certain embodiments, the defoaming agent may be present in an amount of about 0.01% to about 2% w/w of the dry cementitious material. In preferred embodiments, the defoaming agent may be present in an amount ranging from a lower lever of at least about 0%, 0.001%, 0.01% 0.02%, 0.03%, 0.04%, or 0.05% to an upper level of equal to or less than 1%, 0.09%, 0.08%, 0.07%, 0.06%, or 0.05% w/w of the complete dry components of the cement slurry. [0024] In various embodiments, systems configured for preparing, transporting, and delivering the salt-tolerant cement slurries described herein to a downhole location are described. In various embodiments, the systems can comprise a pump fluidly coupled to a tubular (e.g., a casing, drill pipe, production tubing, coiled tubing, etc.) extending into a wellbore penetrating a subterranean formation, the tubular may be configured to circulate or otherwise convey a salt-tolerant cement slurry. The pump may be, for example, a high pressure pump or a low pressure pump, which may depend on, inter alia, the viscosity and density of the salt-tolerant cement slurry, the type of the cementing operation, and the like. [0025] In some embodiments, the systems described herein may further comprise a mixing tank arranged upstream of the pump and in which the salt-tolerant cement slurry is formulated. In various embodiments, the pump (e.g., a low pressure pump, a high pressure pump, or a combination thereof) may convey the salt-tolerant cement slurry from the mixing tank or other source of the salt-tolerant cement slurry to the tubular. In other embodiments, however, the salt-tolerant cement slurry can be formulated offsite and transported to a worksite, in which case the salt-tolerant cement slurry may be introduced to the tubular via the pump directly from a transport vehicle or a shipping container (e.g., a truck, a railcar, a barge, or the like) or from a transport pipeline. In yet other embodiments, the cementing fluid may be formulated on the fly at the well site where components of the cementing fluid are pumped from a transport (e.g., a vehicle or pipeline) and mixed during introduction into the tubular. In any case, the salt-tolerant cement slurry may be drawn into the pump, elevated to an appropriate pressure, and then introduced into the tubular for delivery downhole. [0026] FIG. 1 shows an illustrative schematic of a system that can deliver salt-tolerant cement slurry of the present invention to a downhole location, according to one or more embodiments. It should be noted that while FIG. 1 generally depicts a land-based system, it is to be recognized that like systems may be operated in subsea locations as well. As depicted in FIG. 1, system 1 may include mixing tank 10, in which a salt-tolerant cement slurry of the present invention may be formulated. Again, in some embodiments, the mixing tank 10 may represent or otherwise be replaced with a transport vehicle or shipping container configured to deliver or otherwise convey the cementing fluid to the well site. The salt-tolerant cement slurry may be conveyed via line 12 to wellhead 14, where the salt-tolerant cement slurry enters tubular 16 (e.g., a casing, drill pipe, production tubing, coiled tubing, etc.), tubular 16 extending from wellhead 14 into wellbore 22 penetrating subterranean formation 18. Upon being ejected from tubular 16, the salt-tolerant cement slurry may subsequently return up the wellbore in the annulus between the tubular 16 and the wellbore 22 as indicated by flow lines 24. In other embodiments, the salt-tolerant cement slurry may be reverse pumped down through the annulus and up tubular 16 back to the surface, without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Pump 20 may be configured to raise the pressure of the salt-tolerant cement slurry to a desired degree before its introduction into tubular 16 (or annulus). It is to be recognized that system 1 is merely exemplary in nature and various additional components may be present that have not necessarily been depicted in FIG. 1 in the interest of clarity. Non-limiting additional components that may be present include, but are not limited to, supply hoppers, valves, condensers, adapters, joints, gauges, sensors, compressors, pressure controllers, pressure sensors, flow rate controllers, flow rate sensors, temperature sensors, and the like.

As set forth below, the test results demonstrate that the POZMIX®-A-containing salt-tolerant cement slurry is capable of maintaining good rheological and fluid loss properties at up to about 12% salt contamination. [0046] The POZMIX®-A-containing cement slurry comprised 50% w/w of Portland Cement, 24% w/w POZMIX®-A, 16% w/w MICROMAX®, 10% w/w SSA-2™, 2% w/w CFR-3™, 1.8% w/w salt-tolerant fluid loss additive comprised of an amphoteric copolymer of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid and diallyldimethylammonium chloride, 0.2% w/w Halad®-413, 10% w/w WellLife®-930, 0.1 gps D-AIR 3000L™ (a defoamer available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. of Houston, ΤΧ), 36% w/w NaCI, and 45.8% w/w water. [0047] After the POZMIX®-A-containing cement slurry was prepared, several tests were performed to determine the slurry's properties. A slurry sedimentation test was performed in accordance with API RP 10Β-2/ ISO 10426-2, Section 15 to determine if the POZMIX®-A-containing cement exhibits partial sedimentation. Based on the sedimentation test, the top to bottom density variation of the slurry was only about 2%. Additionally, the POZMIX®-Acontaining cement slurry was tested for fluid loss in accordance with API RP10B-2/ISO 10426-2, Section 10, shrinkage in accordance with API RP 10 B-5/ISO 10426-5, and free fluid in accordance with API RP10B-2/ISO 10426-2, Section 15.5.
