BACKGROUND Metabolic syndrome is a complex of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The most widely recognized of the risk factors are atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure and elevated plasma glucose. In addition, patients with these characteristics commonly manifest a prothrombotic state and a pro-inflammatory state. Atherogenic dyslipidemia consists of an aggregation of lipoprotein abnormalities that includes elevated serum triglyceride and apolipoprotein B, increased small low-density lipoprotein particles and a reduced level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Most patients with metabolic syndrome also have abdominal (central) obesity and insulin resistance. For general background on metabolic syndrome factors and diagnosis, see Alberti et al., Circulation, 120:1640-1645 (2009). Metabolic syndrome is common and has a rising prevalence worldwide, which relates largely to increasing obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Patients with the metabolic syndrome are at twice the risk of developing cardiovascular disease over the next rive to ten years as individuals without the syndrome. The risk over a lifetime undoubtedly is even higher. Furthermore, the metabolic syndrome confers a five-fold increase in risk for WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metabolic syndrome is now both a public health and a clinical problem, and there is clearly a need for new and effective treatments for metabolic syndrome.

Patients with metabolic syndrome can be treated by administering an effective amount of a DA-DKP, a prodrug of a DA-DKP or a pharmaceutically-acceptable sait of either of them. DA-DKP has multiple activities that should make it a particularly effective treatment for metabolic syndrome. First, DA-DKP has been found to suppress the appetite. DA-DKP has also been found to inhibit the differentiation ofpreadipocytes into adipocytes. Accordingly, it is expected to be beneficial in the treatment of metabolic syndrome by contributing to weight loss and the treatment of obesity. It can also be used as a treatment for obesity and for weight loss in general, not just the obesity and excess weight associated with metabolic syndrome. In addition, DA-DKP has also been found to reduce levels of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein) in blood. For this reason, it is expected to have beneficial effects on the dyslipidemia which is one of the risk factors of metabolic syndrome. Another pathological condition associated with the metabolic syndrome is the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in obese patients. NASH is characterized by an accumulation of lipid molecules in the liver accompanied by severe WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin/leptin resistance. In view of the foregoing activities of DA-DKP, it is expected to be beneficial in the treatment of NASH, whether associated with metabolic syndrome or independent of metabolic syndrome. Further, DA-DKP has beneficial effects on the vascular endothelial barrier, including the ability to inhibit vascular hyperpermeability. Accordingly, it is expected to be an effective treatment for those exhibiting early signs of, or with a predisposition to, type 2 diabetes, such as those diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, to reduce, delay or even potentially prevent the vascular complications of diabetes. See Applicant's copending provisional application number 61/380,404, filed September 7, 2010. Finally, DA-DKP is known to inhibit the aggregation ofplatelets, to be antiinflammatory and to inhibit the activation ofT-cells. See U.S. Patents Nos. 6,555,543 and 7,732,403. Accordingly DA-DKP is expected to be useful in combating the prothrombotic and proinflammatory states observed in metabolic syndrome. Methods of making diketopiperazines are well known in the art, and these methods may be employed to synthesize the diketopiperazines of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Patents Nos. 4,694,081, 5,817,751, 5,990,112, 5,932,579 and 6,555,543, US Patent Application Publication Number 2004/0024180, PCT applications WO 96/00391 and WO 97/48685, and Smith et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Letters, 8, 2369-2374 (1998), the complete disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. For instance, diketopiperazines can be prepared by first synthesizing dipeptides. The dipeptides can be synthesized by methods well known in the art using L-amino acids, D-amino acids or a combination of Dand L-amino acids. Preferred are solid-phase peptide synthetic methods. Of course, dipeptides are also available commercially from numerous sources, including Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO (primarily custom synthesis), Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Belmont, CA (custom synthesis), Fisher Scientific (custom synthesis) and Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY. Once the dipeptide is synthesized or purchased, it is cyclized to form a diketopiperazine. This can be accomplished by a variety of techniques. For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2004/0024180 describes a method of cyclizing dipeptides. Briefly, the dipeptide is heated in an organic solvent while removing water by distillation. Preferably, the organic solvent is a low-boiling azeotrope with water, such as acetonitrile, allyl alcohol, benzene, benzyl alcohol, nbutanol, 2-butanol, t-butanol, acetic acid butylester, carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene chloroform, cyclohexane, 1,2-dichlorethane, diethylacetal, dimethylacetal, acetic acid WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 ethylester, heptane, methylisobutylketone, 3-pentanol, toluene and xylene. The temperature depends on the reaction speed at which the cyclization takes place and on the type of azeotroping agent used. The reaction is preferably carried out at 50-200°C, more preferably 80-150°C. The pli range in which cyclization takes place can be easily determine by the person skilled in the art. It will advantageously be 2-9, preferably 3-7. When one or both of the amino acids of the dipeptide has, or is derivatized to have, a carboxyl group on its side chain (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid), the dipeptide is preferably cyclized as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,555,543. Briefly, the dipeptide, with the side-chain carboxyl still protected, is heated under neutral conditions. Typically, the dipeptide will be heated at from about 80°C to about 180°C, preferably at about 120°C. The solvent will be a neutral solvent. For instance, the solvent may comprise an alcohol (such as butanol, methanol, ethanol, and higher alcohols, but not phenol) and an azeotropic co-solvent (such as toluene, benzene, or xylene). Preferably, the alcohol is butan-2-ol, and the azeotropic co-solvent is toluene. The heating is continued until the reaction is complete, and such times can be determined empirically. Typically, the dipeptide will be cyclized by refluxing it for about 8-24 hours, preferably about 18 hours. Finally, the protecting group is removed from the diketopiperazine. In doing so, the use of strong acids (mineral acids, such as sulfuric or hydrochloric acids), strong bases (alkaline bases, such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide), and strong reducing agents (e.g., lithium aluminum hydride) should be avoided, in order to maintain the chirality of the final compound. Dipeptides made on solid phase resins can be cyclized and released from the resin in one step. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,817,751. For instance, the resin having an Nalkylated dipeptide attached is suspended in toluene or toluene/ethanol in the presence of acetic acid (e.g., 1%) or triethylamine (e.g., 4%). Typically, basic cyclization conditions are preferred for their faster cyclization times. To prepare diketopiperazines wherein the amino acid side chains are derivatized, amino acid derivatives can be used in the synthesis of the dipeptides, the dipeptides can be derivatized and/or the diketopiperazines can be derivatized, as is known in the art. See, e.g., those references cited above. Other methods of cyclizing dipeptides and of making diketopiperazines are known in the art and can be used in the preparation of diketopiperazines useful in the practice of the invention. See, e.g., those references listed above. In addition, many diketopiperazines suitable for use in the present invention can be made from proteins and WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 peptides as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,732,403, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Further, diketopiperazines for use in the practice of the invention can be obtained commercially from, e.g., Syngene, India and Hemmo Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd, India (both custom synthesis). The diketopiperazines of the invention include ail possible stereoisomers than can be obtained by varying the configuration of the individual chiral centers, axes or surfaces. In other words, the diketopierazines include ail possible diastereomers, as well as ail optical isomers (enantiomers). "Prodrug" means any compound which releases an active parent drug (a diketopiperazine in this case) in vivo when such prodrug is administered to an animal. Prodrugs of diketopiperazines include derivatives that may be cleaved in vivo to generate the diketopiperazine. Examples of diketopiperazine prodrugs include esters. The physiologically-acceptable salts of the diketopiperazines and prodrugs of the invention may also be used in the practice of the invention. Physiologically-acceptable salts include conventional non-toxic salts, such as salts derived from inorganic acids (such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, and the like), organic acids (such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, glutamic, aspartic, benzoic, salicylic, oxalic, ascorbic acid, and the like) or bases (such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically-acceptable metal cation or organic cations derived from N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, D-glucosamine, or ethylenediamine). The salts are prepared in a conventional manner, e.g., by neutralizing the free base form of the compound with an acid. As noted above, a diketopiperazine of formula I, a prodrug of a diketopiperazine of formula I or a pharmaceutically-acceptable sait of either one of them can be used in the methods of the invention. To do so, the diketopiperazine, prodrug or pharmaceuticallyacceptable sait is administered to an animal in need of treatment. Preferably, the animal is a mammal, such as a rabbit, goat, dog, cat, horse or human. Most preferably, the animal is a human. A diketopiperazine of formula I, a prodrug of a diketopiperazine of formula I or a pharmaceutically-acceptable sait of either one of them is used in the present invention as an active ingredient. "Active ingredient" is used herein to mean a compound having therapeutic, pharmaceutical or pharmacological activity, and particularly the therapeutic, pharmaceutical or pharmacological activities described herein. The diketopiperazine, prodrug or sait of either one of them is not used in the present invention as a carrier or as WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 part of a carrier system of a pharmaceutical composition as described in, e.g., U.S. Patents Nos. 5,976,569, 6,099,856, 7,276,534 and PCT applications WO 96/10396, WO 2006/023943, WO 2007/098500, WO 2007/121411 and WO 2010/102148. Effective dosage forms, modes of administration and dosage amounts for the compounds of the invention (i.e., a diketopiperazine of formula I, a prodrug of a diketopiperazine of formula I or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of either one of them) may be determined empirically using the guidance provided herein. It is understood by those skilled in the art that the dosage amount will vary with the particular disease or condition to be treated, the severity of the disease or condition, the route(s) of administration, the duration of the treatment, the identity of any other drugs being administered to the animal, the age, size and species of the animal, and like factors known in the medical and veterinary arts. In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the present invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. However, the daily dosage will be determined by an attending physician or veterinarian within the scope of sound medical judgment. If desired, the effective daily dose may be administered as two, three, four, rive, six or more sub-doses, administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Administration of the compound should be continued until an acceptable response is achieved. In particular, an effective dosage amount of a diketopiperazine of formula I will be from 10 ng/kg/day to 225 mg/kg/day, preferably from 500 ng/kg/day to 150 mg/kg/day, most preferably from 1 mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day.

In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like), the active ingredient (i.e., a diketopiperazine of formula I, a prodrug of a diketopiperazine of formula I, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of either one of them, or combinations of the foregoing) is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monosterate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and (10) coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. A tablet may be made by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in microencapsulated form. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds of the invention include pharmaceutically-acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents. WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 Suspensions, in addition to the active ingredient, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. The invention also provides pharmaceutical products suitable for treatment of the eye. Such pharmaceutical products include pharmaceutical compositions, devices and implants (which may be compositions or devices). Pharmaceutical formulations (compositions) for intraocular injection of a compound or compounds of the invention into the eyeball include solutions, emulsions, suspensions, particles, capsules, microspheres, liposomes, matrices, etc. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,060,463, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0101582, and PCT application WO 2004/043480, the complete disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. For instance, a pharmaceutical formulation for intraocular injection may comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, suspending agents, thickening agents or viscosity-enhancing agents (such as a hyaluronic acid polymer). Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers include water, saline (preferably 0.9%), dextrose in water (preferably 5%), buffers, dimethylsulfoxide, alcohols and polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like). These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as wetting agents and emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as polymers and gelatin. Injectable depot forms can be made by incorporating the drug into microcapsules or microspheres made of biodegradable polymers such as polylactidepolyglycolide. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters), poly(glycolic) acid, poly(lactic) acid, polycaprolactone and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes (composed of the usual ingredients, such as dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine) or microemulsions which are compatible with eye tissue. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer or lipid, the nature of the particular polymer or lipid components, the type of liposome employed, and whether the microcapsules or microspheres are coated or uncoated, the rate of drug release from microcapsules, microspheres and liposomes can be controlled. WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 The compounds of the invention can also be administered surgically as an ocular implant. For instance, a reservoir container having a diffusible wall ofpolyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl acetate and containing a compound or compounds of the invention can be implanted in or on the sciera. As another example, a compound or compounds of the invention can be incorporated into a polymeric matrix made of a polymer, such as polycaprolactone, poly(glycolic) acid, poly(lactic) acid, poly(anhydride), or a lipid, such as sebacic acid, and may be implanted on the sciera or in the eye. This is usually accomplished with the animal receiving a topical or local anesthetic and using a small incision made behind the cornea. The matrix is then inserted through the incision and sutured to the sciera. The compounds of the invention can also be administered topically to the eye, and a preferred embodiment of the invention is a topical pharmaceutical composition suitable for application to the eye. Topical pharmaceutical compositions suitable for application to the eye include solutions, suspensions, dispersions, drops, gels, hydrogels and ointments. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,407,926 and PCT applications WO 2004/058289, WO 01/30337 and WO 01/68053, the complete disclosures of ail of which are incorporated herein by reference. Topical formulations suitable for application to the eye comprise one or more compounds of the invention in an aqueous or nonaqueous base. The topical formulations can also include absorption enhancers, permeation enhancers, thickening agents, viscosity enhancers, agents for adjusting and/or maintaining the pli, agents to adjust the osmotic pressure, preservatives, surfactants, buffers, salts (preferably sodium chloride), suspending agents, dispersing agents, solubilizing agents, stabilizers and/or tonicity agents. Topical formulations suitable for application to the eye will preferably comprise an absorption or permeation enhancer to promote absorption or permeation of the compound or compounds of the invention into the eye and/or a thickening agent or viscosity enhancer that is capable of increasing the residence time of a compound or compounds of the invention in the eye. See PCT applications WO 2004/058289, WO 01/30337 and WO 01/68053. Exemplary absorption!permeation enhancers include methysulfonylmethane, alone or in combination with dimethylsulfoxide, carboxylic acids and surfactants. Exemplary thickening agents and viscosity enhancers include dextrans, polyethylene glycols, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polysaccharide gels, Gelrite®, cellulosic polymers (such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), carboxyl-containing polymers (such as polymers or copolymers of acrylic acid), polyvinyl alcohol and hyaluronic acid or a sait thereof. WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 Liquid dosage forms (e.g., solutions, suspensions, dispersions and drops) suitable for treatment of the eye can be prepared, for example, by dissolving, dispersing, suspending, etc. a compound or compounds of the invention in a vehicle, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, to form a solution, dispersion or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical formulation may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pli buffering agents and the like, for example sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. Aqueous solutions and suspensions suitable for treatment of the eye can include, in addition to a compound or compounds of the invention, preservatives, surfactants, buffers, salts (preferably sodium chloride), tonicity agents and water. If suspensions are used, the particle sizes should be less than 10 tm to minimize eye irritation. If solutions or suspensions are used, the amount delivered to the eye should not exceed 50 tl to avoid excessive spillage from the eye. Colloidal suspensions suitable for treatment of the eye are generally formed from microparticles (i. e., microspheres, nanospheres, microcapsules or nanocapsules, where microspheres and nanospheres are generally monolithic particles of a polymer matrix in which the formulation is trapped, adsorbed, or otherwise contained, while with microcapsules and nanocapsules the formulation is actually encapsulated). The upper limit for the size of these microparticles is about 5 t to about 10 t. Ophthalmic ointments suitable for treatment of the eye include a compound or compounds of the invention in an appropriate base, such as mineral oil, liquid lanolin, white petrolatum, a combination of two or all three of the foregoing, or polyethylenemineral oil gel. A preservative may optionally be included. Ophthalmic gels suitable for treatment of the eye include a compound or compounds of the invention suspended in a hydrophilic base, such as Carpobol-940 or a combination of ethanol, water and propylene glycol (e.g., in a ratio of 40:40:20). A gelling agent, such as hydroxylethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or ammoniated glycyrrhizinate, is used. A preservative and/or a tonicity agent may optionally be included. Hydrogels suitable for treatment of the eye are formed by incorporation of a swellable, gel-forming polymer, such as those listed above as thickening agents or viscosity enhancers, except that a formulation referred to in the art as a "hydrogel" typically has a higher viscosity than a formulation referred to as a "thickened" solution or WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 suspension. In contrast to such preformed hydrogels, a formulation may also be prepared so to form a hydrogel in situ following application to the eye. Such gels are liquid at room temperature but gel at higher temperatures (and thus are termed "thermoreversible" hydrogels), such as when placed in contact with body fluids. Biocompatible polymers that impart this property include acrylic acid polymers and copolymers, N-isopropylacrylamide derivatives and ABA block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (conventionally referred to as "poloxamers" and available under the Pluronic® tradename from BASF-Wayndotte). Preferred dispersions are liposomal, in which case the formulation is enclosed within liposomes (microscopic vesicles composed of alternating aqueous compartments and lipid bilayers). Eye drops can be formulated with an aqueous or nonaqueous base also comprising one or more dispersing agents, solubilizing agents or suspending agents. Drops can be delivered by means of a simple eye dropper-capped bottle or by means of a plastic bottle adapted to deliver liquid contents dropwise by means of a specially shaped closure. The compounds of the invention can also be applied topically by means of drugimpregnated solid carrier that is inserted into the eye. Drug release is generally effected by dissolution or bioerosion of the polymer, osmosis, or combinations thereof. Several matrix-type delivery systems can be used. Such systems include hydrophilic soft contact lenses impregnated or soaked with the desired compound of the invention, as well as biodegradable or soluble devices that need not be removed after placement in the eye. These soluble ocular inserts can be composed of any degradable substance that can be tolerated by the eye and that is compatible with the compound of the invention that is to be administered. Such substances include, but are not limited to, poly(vinyl alcohol), polymers and copolymers of polyacrylamide, ethylacrylate and vinylpyrrolidone, as well as cross-linked polypeptides or polysaccharides, such as chitin. Dosage forms for the other types of topical administration (i.e., not to the eye) or for transdermal administration of compounds of the invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches, drops and inhalants. The active ingredient may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any buffers, or propellants which may be required. The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the active ingredient, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane. Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of compounds of the invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving, dispersing or otherwise incorporating one or more compounds of the invention in a proper medium, such as an elastomeric matrix material. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate-controlling membrane or dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. A drug-impregnated solid carrier (e.g., a dressing) can also be used for topical administration. Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation or for nasal administration. For administration to the upper (nasal) or lower respiratory tract by inhalation, the compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered from an insufflator, nebulizer or a pressurized pack or other convenient means of delivering an aerosol spray. Pressurized packs may comprise a suitable propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Alternatively, for administration by inhalation or insufflation, the composition may take the form of a dry powder, for example, a powder mix of one or more compounds of the invention and a suitable powder base, such as lactose or starch. The powder composition may be presented in unit dosage form in, for example, capsules or cartridges, or, e.g., gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered with the aid of an inhalator, insufflator or a metered-dose inhaler. For intranasal administration, compounds of the invention may be administered by means of nose drops or a liquid spray, such as by means of a plastic bottle atomizer or metered-dose inhaler. Liquid sprays are conveniently delivered from pressurized packs. Typical of atomizers are the Mistometer (Wintrop) and Medihaler (Riker). Nose drops may be formulated with an aqueous or nonaqueous base also comprising one or more dispersing agents, solubilizing agents or suspending agents. Drops can be delivered by means of a simple eye dropper-capped bottle or by means of a WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 plastic bottle adapted to deliver liquid contents dropwise by means of a specially shaped closure. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administrations comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents. Also, drug-coated stents may be used. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like in the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monosterate and gelatin. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue. The injectable materials can be sterilized for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampules and vials, and may be stored in a lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the type described above. A diketopiperazine of formula I, a prodrug of a diketopiperazine of formula I or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of either one of them, may be given alone in the methods of the invention. Alternatively, the diketopiperazine, prodrug or salt may be given in combination with each other and/or in combination with one or more other treatments or drugs suitable for treating the disease or condition. For instance, the diketopiperazine, the prodrug or the salt can be administered prior to, in conjunction with (including simultaneously with), or after another treatment or drug. In the case of another drug, the drug and the diketopiperazine, prodrug or salt, may be administered in separate pharmaceutical compositions or as part of the same pharmaceutical composition. The invention also provides kits. The kit comprises a container holding a diketopiperazine of formula I, a prodrug thereof or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of either of them. The kit may further comprise one or more additional containers each holding one or more other drugs suitable for use in the methods of the invention. Suitable containers include vials, bottles (including a bottle with a dropper or a squeeze bottle), blister packs, inhalers, jars, nebulizers, packets (e.g., made of foil, plastic, paper, cellophane or another material), syringes and tubes. The kit will also contain instructions for administration of the diketopiperazine, prodrug or salt and, optionally, the one or more other drugs suitable for use in the methods of the invention. The instructions may, for instance, be printed on the packaging holding the container(s), may be printed on a label attached to the kit or the container(s), or may be printed on a separate sheet of paper that is included in or with the kit. The packaging holding the container(s) may be, for instance, a box, or the container(s) may wrapped in, for instance, plastic shrink wrap. The kit may also contain other materials which are known in the art and which may be desirable from a commercial and user standpoint. The kit may, for instance, contain diet and/or exercise information. WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 As used herein, "obese" or "obesity" means a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health, leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breathing difficulties during sleep, certain types of cancer and osteoarthritis. According to the Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC), a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher defines adult humans as obese, and a BMI of from 25.0 to 29.9 defines adult humans as overweight. BMI is calculated by dividing the subject's mass by the square of his or her height (e.g., (pounds x 703)/inches2). "Obesity" in cats and dogs is defined as a body weight that is greater than 20% above optimal body weight. "Treat," "treating" or "treatment" is used herein to mean to reduce (wholly or partially) the symptoms, duration or severity of a disease or condition, including curing the disease, or to prevent the disease or condition. "Inhibiting, "inhibit" and similar terms are used herein to mean to reduce, delay or prevent. As used herein, "a" or "an" means one or more. As used herein, "comprises" and "comprising" include within their scope all narrower terms, such as "consisting essentially of" and "consisting of" as alternative embodiments of the present invention characterized herein by "comprises" or "comprising". In regard to use of "consisting essentially of", this phrase limits the scope of a claim to the specified steps and materials and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the invention disclosed herein. The basic and novel characteristics of the invention can be treatment of metabolic syndrome, suppression of the appetite of an animal in need thereof, treatment of obesity in an animal, reduction of the weight of an animal in need thereof, reduction of a blood lipid level in an animal in need thereof, treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in an animal, inhibition of adipogenesis in an animal, or a combination of any of the foregoing. Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art by consideration of the following non-limiting examples. WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1: Protocol: 1. Two human male volunteers and one human female volunteer (ages 61, 50 and respectively) were administered 100 mg of DA-DKP (packed in a gelatin capsule) orally on an empty stomach after overnight fasting. The DA-DKP was composed of L-aspartic acid and L-alanine. 2. Venous blood samples were drawn into heparinized and EDTA vacutainers at baseline (time zero), 2 hours (hrs), 4 hrs and 24 hrs after the ingestion of the DA-DKP. 3. Blood samples were analyzed for a complete blood count (CBC) and a biochemical survey, including plasma lipids at baseline and at the 24 hrs time points. Plasma was also used for measurement of the level of DA-DKP by a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer (LCMS) method (protocol and results given below). 4. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) from heparinized bloods were extracted by Ficoll gradient method and analyzed by flow cytometry. The protocol and results are given below. 5. Urines were collected for 24 hrs and volumes were recorded. DA-DKP levels were also measured by LCMS. 6. Saliva at 2 hrs was tested for the presence of DA-DKP by LCMS. Summary Of Results: 1. CBC's were unchanged and remained within the normal range. 2. BUN, glucose electrolytes, creatinine, liver function tests, total protein, albumin and calcium were unchanged and within the normal range at 24 hours post ingestion. 3. Lipids decreased across the board for all three subjects at 24 hours post ingestion (see Table 1). 4. DA-DKP plasma levels peaked at about 2 hrs and it was not detectable at 24 hrs post ingestion (see Table 2). 5. Urine levels of DA-DKP were calculated (see Table 2). 6. Saliva DA-DKP levels were calculated (see Table 2) 7. PBMC results are described below. 8. Effects noticed by subjects: a. Significant loss of appetite (lasting 8-9 hrs) - 3/3 subjects b. Slight dry mouth - 2/3 subjects WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 c. Thick saliva1/3 subjects d. Analgesic effect - 1/3 subjects (others did not have pain)* e. Laxative effect - 1/3 subjects f. Slight drowsiness - 1/3 subjects * Analgesic effect: One subject (61 years old) had left knee and left Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain. Approximately 1-2 hrs after ingestion of the DA-DKP, the knee pain was resolved completely and the SI joint pain was reduced by about 50%. The pain originates probably from inflammation caused by sarcoidosis and was 6-7 on a scale of 1-10 before treatment. The effect lasted for about 4 hrs.

WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 Table A Time (rein) Water (%) Methanol (%) 200 mM Ammonium Formée pli 5.4 (%) 0 25 40 10 40 10 40 15.01 25 40 25 40 The output of the HPLC was split 1:20 (v:v) and injected into the mass spectrometer using negative electrospray ionization (-ESI MS) with a scan range of 80 to 1000 m/z, cone voltage of 30 eV, source temperature of 100 °C, and gas temperature of 300 °C. DA-DKP was measured by monitoring the mass 185 in time, which corresponds to DA-DKP minus a single proton (-H+). DA-DKP elutes at 10.4 minutes and was quantified by integrating the area under the curve. The area was compared to a standard curve derived from synthetic DA-DKP standards (DMI Synthesis, Newport Wales, UK) of known concentrations (2000 ng/ml, 1000 ng/ml, 400 ng/ml, 200 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, ng/ml). The calibration curve was found to fit very well in this range using a quadratic curve on log axes with an R2 of 0.997. The results are presented in Table 2 below. The results are for plasma unless otherwise noted in Table 2.

A separate culture without OKT3 antibody was used as the NIL control. After culture overnight at 37°C cells were washed, incubated with an anti-CD69 antibody, fixed and analyzed on the flow cytometer for CD69 expression. CD69 is an early activation antigen indicative of leukocyte immunocompetence. Results (for a single individual) indicated that CD69 expression on CD45RA and CD45RO cells was decreased after ingestion of DA-DKP from that before DA-DKP intake (time zero) with the greatest effect seen at 4 hours after DA-DKP ingestion. Dual histogram analysis indicated that the major effect was seen on the CD45RO (or previously activated "memory") subset of T-cells (4 hours, OKT3 Stim. panel). Discussion: The main effects observed after oral administration of DA-DKP were the lack of appetite (which could lead to weight loss, obesity being a cardinal feature of the metabolic syndrome) and the decrease in blood cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and HDL (dyslipidemia being another feature of the metabolic syndrome). Also, the prevention of activation of previously activated T cells in response to an anti-CD3 stimulation, but not of the naive T cells, is an important finding (inflammation being implicated in the metabolic syndrome). These together with in vitro data showing the inhibition of the differentiation ofpreadipocytes into adipocytes by DA-DKP (see Example 2) and the beneficial effects of DA-DKP on the vascular endothelial barrier (see co-pending provisional application number 61/380,404, filed September 7, 2010), support the idea of using DA-DKP as a therapeutic for the metabolic syndrome. EXAMPLE 2: A. INTRODUCTION Adipogenesis is a multi-step process that involves the conversion of stem cells into fat-storing cells termed adipocytes. Adipose tissue mass enlarges and ultimately obesity ensues when energy intake chronically exceeds energy expenditure (1) (the numbers in parentheses refer to the references listed at the end of this Example 2). At the cellular level, this balance shift manifests itself through mature adipocytes accommodating excess WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 energy through enhanced triacylglycerol storage (2). When a critical size threshold is reached, it is hypothesized that overloaded adipocytes signal preadipocytes to differentiate into new adipocytes to store the excess energy (3). Not surprisingly, obese animals have an increased amount of, and larger, adipocytes compared with lean animals (4). Any factor that inhibits cellular differentiation into the adipocyte lineage could be medically useful in treating obesity. However, a complete understanding of the adipogenic pathway, both inhibitory and stimulatory pathways, is necessary since the modulation of adipose tissue mass may have both advantageous and deleterious health effects (5). Recently, due to increased obesity research, adipose tissue is now recognized as an endocrine organ due to its hormonal role in the regulation of metabolism, energy intake, and fat storage (6). Adipose tissue accomplishes fat regulation by secreting > 50 proteins, termed adipokines, that act in an autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine fashion to control various metabolic functions (6). The most studied adipokines are adiponectin and leptin which decrease serum free fatty acid, glucose, and triacylglycerol concentrations by insulin sensitivity enhancement (7), and influence food intake by the hypothalamus (8), respectively. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa and IL-6 play an important role in normal and pathological adipogenesis (2). After receptor binding by adipokines and/or cytokines, various intercellular molecular pathways important to adipogenesis can become activated or inhibited. Activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) has an important role in adipocyte differentiation, and deregulation of MAPK can contribute to obesity (9). B. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture Subcutaneous preadipocytes (Zen-Bio, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC) were cultured to near confluency at 5% CO2 , 37°C in Preadipocyte Growth Medium-2 (PGM-2, Lonza, Walkersville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, and GA-1000. Cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA (Lonza) and initially seeded in 96well black/clear bottom plates at 3,000 cells/well. Cells were allowed to form a confluent monolayer for 7 days in culture. Cell Dosing and Differentiation 7-day old medium was aspirated and cells were dosed with DA-DKP (doses used in PGM-2 media: 25, 50, or 100 gM) in triplicate on two plates. The DA-DKP was composed of L-aspartic acid and L-alanine. PGM-2 differentiation media (containing insulin, dexamethasone, indomethacin, and isobutyl-methylxanthine; Lonza) was added to WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 one plate, while PGM-2 media was added to the other. Plates were then placed back in culture and allowed to incubate for 14 days. Adipogenesis Assay After the 14 day incubation period, culture media were collected from all wells and stored at -20°C for IL-6 ELISA (see below). Wells were rinsed once with 1X PBS (Lonza). 50gL M-PER lysis solution (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) were added to all wells, and complete cell lysis was achieved by mixing each well. 150gL 1X PBS was added to each well. 5gL AdipoRedTM Reagent (Lonza) was added to each well, and the plate was mixed immediately by gentle tapping. After 10 minutes, fluorescence was measured on a plate reader set at kEx = 485nm and kEM = 572nm. IL-6 ELISE Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) matched-pair antibodies for interleukin-6 (IL-6) were obtained from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). IL-6 was analyzed by ELISE and performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 1:10 dilution of each supernatant was measured in duplicate using an IL-6 standard (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Data Analysis The triplicate fluorescent values for each treatment were averaged and subtracted from the average media only (i.e. no cells) wells. For the differentiated wells, a % change was calculated by subtracting the average fluorescent value for the differentiated cells from the undifferentiated cells for each treatment group. This result was then subtracted from the difference between the differentiated and undifferentiated control groups (i.e. cells only with no treatment). Finally, this result was then divided by the difference between the differentiated and undifferentiated control groups to give a % change. All data are expressed as + SD. Statistical significance is reported when p < 0.05 based on the Student t-test (Microsoft Excel). C. RESULTS DA-DKP caused an increase in adipogenesis at the highest dose (100 gM) while the lowest dose (25 gM) caused a significant decrease in adipogenesis (see Figure 1). Interestingly, DA-DKP had no significant effect on IL-6 levels after the 2 week differentiation period (data not shown). D. DISCUSSION Obesity has been described as the epidemic of the 21st century due to an increase in the prevalence of obesity as well as an earlier age of onset (6). This results in a major WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 public health issue since obesity increases the risk of several chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular complications, arthritis, asthma, and certain cancers (10). Naturally, the search for a therapeutic agent that reverses the deleterious effects of obesity is the subject of a considerable amount of current research efforts. In this study, DA-DKP was effective at preventing adipogenesis (as measured by total intracellular triglyceride concentrations). A potential cellular pathway target of DA-DKP is the family of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK). MAPK are serine/threonine kinase that include extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38. MAPKs are important in regulating both normal and pathological adipogenesis (9). Previously, the inhibitory effect of DA-DKP on MAPK activity in T-lymphocytes has been shown (12). It is possible that DA-DKP inhibits adipogenesis by MAPK inhibition, but specific inhibition of MAPK isoforms such as ERK1 and JNK1 seems promising in preventing pathological adipogenesis without interference to other essential MAPK functions (9). Another important pathway involved in cellular differentiation including adipogenesis involves the cytoskeleton. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, forced cell rounding, microtubule disruption, and stress fiber formation are all observed cytoskeletal changes during adipogenesis (11). DA-DKP has been shown to stabilize the cytoskeletal network in endothelial cells (see co-pending provisional application number 61/380,404, filed September 7, 2010). DA-DKP is a naturally occurring molecule produced by an unknown mechanism involving the cleavage of the first two amino acids of human serum albumin and subsequent cyclization of the cleaved dipeptide (13). Additionally, DA-DKP has strong anti-inflammatory characteristics in immune cell models (12, 13). Interestingly, the proinflammatory pathway plays an important role in adipogenesis (6). In deregulated adipose tissue seen in obesity and diabetes, both local and systemic inflammation as well as insulin resistance and ectopic lipid accumulation are observed (14). Therefore, the antiinflammatory tendencies of DA-DKP could be useful in combating the degree of inflammation seen in obese patients. However, no effect of DA-DKP on IL-6 levels was seen at the end of the differentiation period, suggesting that DA-DKP does not interfere with the pathway that regulates IL-6 levels during adipogenesis. This does not rule out the possibility of using DA-DKP as an anti-inflammatory in already obese patients. Recently, a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors that include diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension have been grouped together and termed the metabolic WO 2012/033792 CA 02810844 2013-03-07 PCT/US2011/050618 syndrome (15). It has been estimated that adults with the metabolic syndrome are twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease compared to those without the syndrome (16). Clearly, decreases in abdominal obesity lead to substantial improvements in the metabolic risk profile resulting in a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (17). Another pathological condition associated with the metabolic syndrome is the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in obese patients. NASH is characterized by an accumulation of lipid molecules in the liver accompanied by severe inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin!leptin resistance (18). Therefore, therapeutics that regulate further adipogenesis and/or decrease inflammation in adipose tissue could decrease the increased cardiovascular risk associated with the metabolic syndrome and be an effective treatment for NASH. The increased prevalence of obesity in Western countries has lead to increases in various co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Searching for a therapeutic that increases fat metabolism and/or decreases fat storage has been the goal of many nutritional scientists. Here, evidence is presented of the antiadipogenic effects of a compound that potentially targets a key regulator of adipogenesis (MAPK), stabilizes the cytoskeleton, and decreases inflammation, making it an attractive potential treatment for metabolic syndrome and a treatment to reduce obesity.
