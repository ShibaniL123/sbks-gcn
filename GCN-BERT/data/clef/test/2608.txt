Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-((3-(fluoromethyl)oxetan-3-yl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
4-Bromo-2-methoxybenzaldehyde (645 mg, 3.00 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-3-(2-(((3-(fluoromethyl)oxetan-3-yl)methyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (400 mg, 1.5 mmol) in acetic acid (7.4 mL) and water (135 μl, 7.50 mmol). The reaction was heated to 80° C. for 4 hours. After cooling, the acetic acid was evaporated, then the residue was dissolved in DCM and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated. The residue was dissolved in methanol (5 mL), then hydroxylamine hydrochloride (313 mg, 4.50 mmol) and potassium acetate (588 mg, 6.00 mmol) were added and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The volatiles were evaporated, then the residue was dissolved in DCM and water. The layers were separated, then the aqueous was extracted with DCM. The combined organics were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated, then the crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 50% EtOAc in heptane. Product containing to fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-((3-(fluoromethyl)oxetan-3-yl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (302 mg, 43%) as a beige solid.
