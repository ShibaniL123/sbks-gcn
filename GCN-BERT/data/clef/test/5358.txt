CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/953,496, filed Mar. 14, 2014, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD Disclosed herein are compositions and methods for improving hemostasis in the treatment of bleeding disorders and reversal of anticoagulant activity. BACKGROUND The coagulation cascade by which the human body produces blood clots is the body's primary mechanism to stop bleeding. Blood clots are produced by platelets sticking together in a fibrin matrix to form a plug at an injured blood vessel site. The body's inability to form blood clots can lead to excessive bleeding which can be very dangerous. Blood which cannot clot properly in an individual is often the sign of a bleeding disorder. The inability to form blood clots may be due to a deficiency or lack of clotting factors in the coagulation cascade. For instance, hemophilia A, the most common type of hemophilia, is a largely inherited bleeding disorder in which there is a Factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency. For a person with hemophilia A that gets injured, bleeding is not stopped easily and requires a longer time to be arrested. The development of antibodies, also called inhibitors, against FVIII in response to FVIII replacement therapy is an additional challenge for treatment of hemophilia A. A less common type of hemophilia, hemophilia B, is also a largely inherited bleeding disorder that results in a Factor IX (FIX) deficiency and is also known as “Christmas disease.” The development of antibodies, also called inhibitors, against FIX in response to FIX replacement therapy is an additional challenge for treatment of hemophilia B. Another bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease, also an inherited genetic disease, is caused by a deficiency or defect in the von Willebrand factor (vWF), a blood clotting protein. The vWF is critical in the initial stages of blood clotting as it interacts with the platelets to form a plug at the site of injury. Treatment of bleeding disorders usually involves replacing the blood clotting factor which is either lacking or deficient. The factors can either be purified from donated human plasma (plasma-derived factors), or made recombinantly (recombinant factors). Antibodies, also called inhibitors, can develop when an individual with a bleeding disorder is treated with FVIII replacement therapy and the body recognizes the therapy as a threat instead of treatment. In response to the perceived threat the immune system makes antibodies, also called inhibitors, which attack FVIII. This can be very dangerous as the inhibitors can prevent or inhibit FVIII from controlling bleeding. Therefore, in the case of development of inhibitors against the administered clotting factor, bypass therapies have to be applied. Treatment of hemophilia A is complicated by development of FVIII neutralizing antibodies, occurring in about 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A. Similar inhibitory or neutralizing antibody formation can occur in patients treated with FIX or vWF replacement therapy. Currently there are two standard treatment options for hemophilia patients who have developed inhibitors against FVIII or FIX: monotherapy with FEIBA® (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, Ill.) or recombinant FVIIa. There are other options such as using prothrombin complexes or even plasma exchange, but they have more side effects and are not as efficacious. FEIBA® (factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity) has been used for over thirty years in the treatment of patients with hemophilia. It is an integral part of bypass therapy in hemophiliacs with inhibitors, controls bleeding in 93% of episodes, and has a high safety profile. Some patients are refractory or non-responsive to monotherapy with FEIBA® or recombinant FVIIa thus, there is a need for improvement of inhibitor therapy in the art. The inventors have identified effective ratios of human prothrombin (FII) and activated factor X (FXa) for the treatment of bleeding disorders that are as efficacious as FEIBA®, but require a lower amount of FII. FII and FXa can either be recombinant or plasma-derived.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Effective ratios of human prothrombin (FII) and activated factor X (FXa) are herein described to aid in the treatment of bleeding disorders and the reversal of anticoagulant activity. Disclosed herein are compositions for treating a bleeding disorder comprising FII and FXa wherein the molar ratio of FXa to FII is less than 1:20,000. FII and FXa can either be plasma derived or recombinant. The production of recombinant proteins such as FII and FXa is well known in the art. For example, EP 1460131 describes a process for producing recombinant human blood clotting factors in human cell lines. Further, WO 2005/038019 describes producing high yields of coagulation factors recombinantly. The process of isolating coagulation factors from plasma products is also well known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,883,598 describes the process for isolating coagulation factors from blood plasma or plasma products using liquid chromatography. FEIBA® is a plasma-derived activated prothrombin complex concentrate used to treat bleeding episodes in hemophilic patients with inhibitors. FII and FXa have been identified as the most critical components that mediate the hemostatic effect of FEIBA®. The molar ratio of FXa and FII in FEIBA® ranges from 1:20,000-40,000, i.e. 1 U/mL of FEIBA® results in plasma concentrations of 0.035-0.07 nM FXa and 1400 nM FII. The molar ratio ranges of FXa to FII in FEIBA® results in a high prothrombin requirement which is challenging to produce recombinantly. FII and FX are complex proteins with multiple structural domains and post-translational modifications. Both can be produced recombinantly in mammalian cell lines, e.g. CHO. Factor X needs to be further activated to FXa for co-formulation with FII in the compositions of the present embodiments. Hemophiliac patients “with inhibitors” can mean hemophiliac patients with antibodies, with neutralizing antibodies, with inhibitory antibodies or the like. The inhibitors can develop when an individual with a bleeding disorder is treated with a replacement therapy and the body recognizes the therapy as a threat instead of treatment. In the past, recombinant partial prothrombinase has been developed based on the FXa/FII ratio that is present in FEIBA® to explore the efficacy of this combination of coagulation factors. However, in this approach the expression and production of high amounts of recombinant FII was the limiting factor. Studies were performed to identify effective ratios of human FII and FXa that are as active and efficacious as FEIBA®, but require a lower amount of FII. Further, exploratory expression studies by using state-of-the-art expression platforms and clone screening technologies demonstrated technical feasibility of recombinant factor X and prothrombin generation. State-of-the-art expression system in CHO cells provided high yields at high protein quality and potency for both factors. Combination of recombinant FXa and prothrombin may be used as an option for hemophilia inhibitor therapy. An additional benefit of the compositions of the present embodiments may be decreased risk of thrombosis, as the FII concentration is lower this may lead to fewer spontaneous clotting events, especially when used in non-hemophilic patients for anticoagulant reversal. Surprisingly, it was found that ratios of FII to FXa very different from those found in FEIBA® were as effective at controlling bleeding. In certain embodiments, a composition for treating bleeding disorders comprises FII and FXa wherein the molar ratio of FXa to FII is less than about 1:20,000, less than about 1:19,000, less than about 1:18,000, less than about 1:17,000, less than about 1:16,000, less than about 1:15,000, less than about 1:14,000, less than about 1:13,000, less than about 1:12,000, less than about 1:11,000, less than about 1:10,000, less than about 1:9,000, less than about 1:8,000, less than about 1:7,000, less than about 1:6,000, less than about 1:5,000, less than about 1:4,000, less than about 1:3,000, less than about 1:2,000, less than about 1:1,000, less than about 1:950, less than about 1:900, less than about 1:850, less than about 1:800, less than about 1:750, less than about 1:700, less than about 1:650, less than about 1:600, less than about 1:550, less than about 1:500, less than about 1:450, less than about 1:400, less than about 1:350, less than about 1:300, less than about 1:250, less than about 1:200, less than about 1:150, less than about 1:100, less than about 1:95, less than about 1:90, less than about 1:85, less than about 1:80, less than about 1:75, less than about 1:70, less than about 1:65, less than about 1:60, less than about 1:55, less than about 1:50, less than about 1:45, less than about 1:40, less than about 1:35, less than about 1:30, less than about 1:25, less than about 1:20, less than about 1:15, less than about 1:10, or less than about 1:5.

In other embodiments, a composition for treating bleeding disorders comprises about 4.4 mg/kg of FII and about 275 ng/kg of FXa. In certain embodiments, a composition for treating bleeding disorders comprises about 0.1 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg of FII and about 600 ng/kg to about 1100 ng/kg of FXa, about 0.5 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg of FII and about 500 ng/kg to about 1000 ng/kg of FXa, about 1 mg/kg to about 1.5 mg/kg of FII and about 450 ng/kg to about 950 ng/kg of FXa, about 2.0 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg of FII and about 400 ng/kg to about 900 ng/kg of FXa, about 2.5 mg/kg to about 3.0 mg/kg of FII and about 350 ng/kg to about 850 ng/kg of FXa, about 3.5 mg/kg to about 4.5 mg/kg of FII and about 300 ng/kg to about 600 ng/kg of FXa, or about 4.5 mg/kg to about 5.5 mg/kg of FII and about 200 ng/kg to about 600 ng/kg of FXa.

In yet other embodiments, a composition for treating bleeding disorders comprises about 1.2 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg of FII and about 200 ng/kg to about 540 ng/kg of FXa. In some embodiments, the FXa is approximately 90% FXaα and 10% FXaβ forms. Alternatively the FXa can be approximately 100% FXaα and 0% FXaβ forms, approximately 80% FXaα and 20% FXaβ forms, approximately 70% FXaα and 30% FXaβ forms, approximately 60% FXaα and 40% FXaβ forms, approximately 50% FXaα and 50% FXaβ forms, approximately 40% FXaα and 60% FXaβ forms, approximately 30% FXaα and 70% FXaβ forms, approximately 20% FXaα and 80% FXaβ forms, approximately 10% FXaα and 90% FXaβ forms, or approximately 0% FXaα and 100% FXaβ forms. Bleeding disorders include, but are not limited to, hemophilia A, hemophilia B, von Willebrand disease, congenital hemophilia A with inhibitors or acquired hemophilia A with inhibitory auto antibodies to FVIII, congenital hemophilia B with inhibitors or acquired hemophilia B with inhibitory auto antibodies to FIX, blood loss from trauma, FVII deficiency, FV deficiency, FX deficiency, FXI deficiency, FXIII deficiency, fibrinogen deficiency, prothrombin deficiency, dilutional coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, blood loss from high-risk surgeries, intracerebral hemorrhage, von Willebrand disease with inhibitors to von Willebrand factor, or combinations thereof. Anticoagulants are used to treat and prevent blood clots. Individuals who are at risk at developing a blood clot, or to prevent an existing blood clot from growing, are given an anticoagulant. Those at risk for developing a blood clot include those with atrial fibrillation, a mechanical heart valve, endocarditis, mitral stenosis, certain blood disorders, and those who have had hip replacement surgery or knee replacement surgery. Sometimes reversal of anticoagulants is necessary for example, in situations where there is a high risk of bleeding. The pharmacological effect of some anticoagulants, for example warfarin, can be readily reversed by the administration of vitamin K. Some more recently introduced anticoagulants such as apixaban, betrixaban, and rivaroxaban cannot be readily reversed by the administration of vitamin K. Currently there is no antidote for unwanted bleeding caused by these anticoagulants which can be quite dangerous. Thus, an additional benefit of the compositions disclosed herein is when used in non-hemophilic patients for anticoagulant reversal, there are fewer spontaneous clotting events. Routes of administration for the disclosed compositions include, but are not limited to, parenteral injection, intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection, and intramuscular injection. Dosing can be single dosage or cumulative (serial dosing), and can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. For instance, treatment of congenital hemophilia may comprise administration of an effective dose of a composition disclosed herein for an entire lifetime. As a non-limiting example, an effective dose of a composition disclosed herein can be administered once to an individual, e.g., as a single injection. Alternatively, treatment of a bleeding disorder may comprise multiple administrations of an effective dose of a composition disclosed herein carried out over a range of time periods, such as, e.g., daily, once every few days, or weekly. As a non-limiting example, a composition disclosed herein can be administered twice or three times weekly to an individual. The timing of administration can vary from individual to individual, depending upon such factors as the severity of an individual's symptoms. For example, an effective dose of a composition disclosed herein can be administered to an individual once a day, or every two to three days, for an indefinite period of time. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the condition of the individual can be monitored throughout the course of treatment and that the effective amount of a composition disclosed herein that is administered can be adjusted accordingly. The clinical efficacy can be described by controlling bleeding. Administration can be on demand, prophylactic, pre-operative or peri-operative. Certain embodiments include a pharmaceutical composition for treating bleeding disorders comprising plasma-derived FII and FXa wherein the molar ratio of FXa to FII is less than 1:20,000 and at least one excipient.

In other embodiments, a composition for treating bleeding disorders comprises about 0.44 mg/kg of FII and about 826 ng/kg of FXa. In other embodiments, a composition for treating bleeding disorders comprises about 4.4 mg/kg of FII and about 275 ng/kg of FXa. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition for treating bleeding disorders comprises at least one excipient and about 0.1 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg of FII and about 600 ng/kg to about 1100 ng/kg of FXa, about 0.5 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg of FII and about 500 ng/kg to about 1000 ng/kg of FXa, about 1 mg/kg to about 1.5 mg/kg of FII and about 450 ng/kg to about 950 ng/kg of FXa, about 2.0 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg of FII and about 400 ng/kg to about 900 ng/kg of FXa, about 2.5 mg/kg to about 3.0 mg/kg of FII and about 350 ng/kg to about 850 ng/kg of FXa, about 3.5 mg/kg to about 4.5 mg/kg of FII and about 300 ng/kg to about 600 ng/kg of FXa, or about 4.5 mg/kg to about 5.5 mg/kg of FII and about 200 ng/kg to about 600 ng/kg of FXa. In other embodiments, a composition for treating bleeding disorders comprises about 0.2 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg of FII and about 560 ng/kg to about 1100 ng/kg of FXa. In other embodiments, a composition for treating bleeding disorders comprises about 1.2 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg of FII and about 200 ng/kg to about 540 ng/kg of FXa. To determine the molar ratio of FXa to FII useful in treating bleeding disorders, a translational in vitro-to-in vivo approach was used. First, combinations were tested in vitro for their procoagulant potential in comparison to FEIBA® using a global hemostatic assay system with human plasma. Second, selected FII/FXa plasma concentrations were translated into doses for hemophilia-induced rabbits and the efficacy assessed in an acute bleeding model. The experiments for the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of different ratios of human FII and FXa were performed with carefully selected commercially available plasma-derived proteins from Enyzme Research Laboratories. For the selection, proteins from different suppliers had been tested for purity (Silver staining, Western Blotting), activity (thrombin generation in human and rabbit plasma), concentration and pricing. Knowing the composition and active components of the multi-component FEIBA®, a combination of two coagulation factors was generated: human FII and FXa. A human plasma-based calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) assay was applied to identify FII/FXa combinations at specific ratios that had a similar in vitro procoagulant effect in FVIII-inhibited plasma as FEIBA®. Three FII/FXa ratios were selected, translated into preclinical doses and efficacy assessed in a rabbit bleeding model. Three compositions, the first with 100% FII and FXa (same as in FEIBA®), the second with 10% prothrombin and 300% FXa, and FEIBA® showed statistically significant efficacy. The latter dose contains ˜20-fold less FII and 4-fold more FXa compared to previous studies. The dose with 25% FII and 200% FXa was not effective. The observed hemostatic effect appears to be mediated by neither FII nor FXa alone. In conclusion, the ratio of FII and FXa was adjusted so that activity and in vivo efficacy were unaltered and recombinant protein production for a recombinant version of FII/FXa remained feasible. Example 1 In Vitro Evaluation of FXa/FII Combination in a Thrombin Generation Assay The calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) assay has been used to monitor the pro- and anticoagulant effects of substances in human plasma. The thrombogram describes the concentration of thrombin in clotting plasma and the CAT is therefore a general physiologic function test of the hemostatic system. The assay is based on the measurement of fluorescence that is generated by the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Z-G-G-R-AMC by thrombin over time upon initiation of coagulation by Tissue Factor (TF). The assay is performed on a Thrombograph™, a 96-well plate fluorometer available from Thermo Scientific, and uses a thrombin calibrator that is needed to correct for inner filter effect, donor-to-donor variability in color of plasma, substrate depletion and instrumental differences. The procoagulant activity of various combinations of plasma-derived FII (140-1400 nM) and FXa (0.035-0.21 nM) was assessed by CAT in FVIII-inhibited plasma. A normal human plasma pool (George King Biomedical) was treated with 50 Bethesda units (BU)/mL goat anti-FVIII plasma (Baxter). Corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI, 40 μg/mL, Haematologic Technologies) was added to inhibit pre-activation by factor XIIa. Clotting was triggered with 1 pM TF+4 μM phospholipids (PL) (PPP LOW reagent, Thrombinoscope BV). Thrombin generation was monitored at 37° C. for 90 min in a Fluoroskan Ascent reader (Thermo Scientific; wavelength 390/460 nm) after recalcification. Duplicate measurements were performed for each sample. A CAT protocol optimized for rabbit plasma (40 μL/mL CTI, final plasma dilution of 1:3, 0.6 pM TF and 4 μM PL) was used to confirm in spike-in studies that human FII and FXa are also active in rabbit plasma. The same CAT protocol was used for the analysis of ex vivo rabbit plasma samples in the context of the nail clip bleeding study. The feasibility of reducing the amount of FII within the FII/FXa combination was first tested in a human-plasma based CAT assay. Starting point was the FXa:FII ratio as found in FEIBA® (1:20,000), which is equivalent to plasma concentrations of 0.07 nM FXa and 1400 nM FII. The effect of decreasing the FII concentration from 1400 nM (100% FII) to 140 nM (10% FII) while keeping the FXa concentration constant at 0.14 nM (200%) is shown in FIG. 1. It was observed that 0.14 nM FXa alone corrected thrombin generation in FVIII-inhibited plasma as well as 1 U/mL FEIBA®. The presence of FII increased the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) in a dose-dependent manner and resulted in higher thrombin generation than 1 U/mL FEIBA®. Subsequently, a wider concentration range of FII (105 nM to 1400 nM) and FXa (0.035 to 0.21 nM) was cross-titrated in the CAT assay (FIG. 2). A target range for the desired procoagulant activity of FII/FXa was established by testing the effect of 20 different FEIBA® lots at 1 U/mL. The ETP was used as comparative CAT parameter as it showed the most significant change in response to FII/FXa. A few FII/FXa combinations were identified to lie within the range of FEIBA® activity in correcting thrombin generation in FVIII-inhibited plasma, resulting in 100% to 7.5% prothrombin and 100 to 300% FXa as in FEIBA® (Table 1). A slight decrease in thrombin generation upon FII reduction can be compensated by a moderate increase in FXa. Three combinations were selected to be tested in an in vivo efficacy model in hemophilia A-induced rabbits.

Example 2 In Vivo: Proof of Concept Efficacy in Hemophilia-Induced Rabbit Model The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to assess the efficacy of three FII/FXa doses administered together or alone in a nail-clip bleeding model in FVIII-inhibited rabbits (FIG. 3A). The dose with highest FII amount was 4.4 mg/kg FII+275 ng/kg FXa and is defined as “FEIBA® ratio” and 100% for both FII and FXa. The second dose 1.1 mg/kg FII+551 ng/kg FXa had FII reduced to 25% and FXa increased to 200%. The third dose 0.44 mg/kg FII+826 ng/kg FXa had FII reduced to 10% and FXa increased to 300%. Efficacy was determined for each treatment in terms of reduced blood loss after treatment in comparison to a buffer-only control group. FEIBA® (75 U/kg) served as a positive control. Conscious New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits were intravenously administered with 2 mL/kg FVIII inhibitor (17,000 BU/kg) to deplete endogenous FVIII. After approximately 20 mins, the animals were anesthetized by subcutaneous injection with 5 mg/kg xylazine and 75 mg/kg ketamine. Rabbits were laid on a heating pad to prevent hypothermia, and the hair on digit II of the right hind limb shaved. The nail was cut 3 mm from the distal edge of the blood supply matrix 45 min after application of inhibitor plasma. Blood was then collected for 30 min in a tube with saline (room temperature) by immersing the bleeding nail. After this first observation period, the saline tubes were exchanged to prevent drying of the inflicted wound. Six male NZW rabbits were used per group. The animals received intravenous treatment with test or control item. Ten min after application of test or control item, the bleeding nail was inserted in a third tube with saline, and blood collected again for 30 min. For each tube, the amount of blood was measured gravimetrically. The experimental procedure is depicted in FIG. 3A. The rabbits were killed at the end of the second observation period by injecting an overdose of pentobarbital. Blood loss within 30 min before and after application of treatment was summarized by treatment group using medians, inter-quartile ranges (IQRs), ranges (minimum to maximum), arithmetic means and coefficients of variation as depicted in FIG. 3B. The efficacious dose of about 826 ng/kg of FXa and about 0.44 mg/kg of FII has a 90% reduced FII amount compared to the FEIBA® ratio. The results demonstrate that lowering the FII amount and slightly increasing FXa is sufficient to correct bleeding in a hemophilia animal model. Animals were pretreated with FVIII inhibitor to achieve transient hemophilia A, closely mimicking the situation in hemophilic patients with inhibitors. The efficacy of test and control item was assessed using a nail-clip bleeding model; thrombelastography and CAT assay were performed to gain additional information (see Example 3). In the nail-clip bleeding assay, there was a statistically significantly lower blood loss with FEIBA® (75 U/kg) than with buffer (p=0.02273) providing statistical evidence that the complex experimental system was operating correctly. From an exploratory point of view, treatment with FII (4.38 mg/kg)+FXa (275 ng/kg) and FII (0.44 mg/kg)+FXa (826 ng/kg) showed a statistically significantly smaller blood loss than buffer (p≦0.01403). In conclusion, it is feasible to reduce the amount of FII in the FII/FXa combination drastically by slightly increasing the amount of FXa without losing the hemostatic efficacy. This would make the commercial production of recombinant FII for a recombinant combination of FII/FXa economically easier. Example 3 Ex Vivo Analysis of Rabbit Whole Blood or Plasma by Thromboelastography and CAT Assay Blood samples of FVIII-inhibited rabbits after administration of FEIBA®, FII or FXa alone or in combination, or buffer were analyzed ex vivo by thromboelastography (TEG). Measurements were performed using a TEG hemostasis analyzer 5000 (Haemonetics Corp, USA) at 37° C. Blood was sampled before and 45 min after administration of FVIII-inhibitor plasma, immediately after administration of test or control item, and at the end of the second bleeding observation period (approximately 40 min after test item administration). Blood was sampled by puncturing a central ear artery using a 2-mL syringe (20 gauge needle) filled with 0.1 mL sodium citrate and 21 μL CTI (Haematologic Technologies, 3 mg/mL). The animals were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture at the end of the second bleeding observation period. 1 mL of citrated whole blood (blood:citrate=10:1) was drawn. Each blood sample (320 μL) was mixed with 20 μL of TF. (0.04 pM final concentration) and re-calcified with 20 μL of a 0.2 M CaCl2 solution in a pre-warmed TEG cuvette at 37° C. Measurement was started immediately and duplicates measured in parallel for each blood sample. The TEG run was either stopped after all relevant measurements were obtained or cancelled after 2 h if no clot formed. The TEG parameters of clotting time (R-time), speed of clot formation (K-time) rapidity of clot strengthening (angle) and maximum clot firmness (MA) were recorded. Ex vivo analysis of whole rabbit blood by TEG (FIG. 4) 5 min after treatment with 75 U/kg FEIBA® showed a statistically significant reduction in R-time compared with buffer (p<0.001). The same was true for all other treatment groups (p<0.001). The effect was still observed at the end of the study, approximately 40 min after test article administration, except for the FII alone group where the clotting time was back at the level of FVIII-inhibited blood. In general, the TEG assay appeared to be very sensitive to FXa. While FXa alone was not efficacious for the reduction of relative blood loss in vivo, the blood samples showed significantly reduced R-times ex vivo. Rabbit plasma samples were also analyzed by CAT analysis. FIG. 5 shows representative thrombin generation profiles for one animal of each dosing group at all four timepoints. The group dosed with FII alone is not represented, but had no effect on thrombin generation. Administration of the positive control (75 U/mL FEIBA®) led to the largest increase in thrombin generation 5 min after treatment. Combined treatment of FVIII-inhibited rabbits with plasma-derived human FII and FXa showed a beneficial effect on thrombin generation in rabbit plasma and reached ETP values that were closer to the normal baseline than the FEIBA® control. A moderate increase in thrombin generation is preferable over massive thrombin generation as this may be an indicator for thrombogenic activity. The most obvious difference between the different FII/FXa doses in the CAT assay is the high ETP values (area under the curve) of the thrombin profiles depending on the FII concentration. This can be explained by the additional substrate in the form of prothrombin that is introduced to the plasma sample, which is quickly activated to thrombin by FXa. Plasmas of animals dosed with FII or FXa administered alone and the buffer did not affect thrombin generation significantly.
