A GAME WHEREIN THE PLAYERS PERFORM PHYSICAL EXERCISES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [001] The present invention generally relates to physical activity and, more particularly, to playing a game while engaging in physical activity. [002] There is an obesity and inactivity problem in America. Over 78 million U.S. adults, and about 12.5 million (i.e., 16.9%) children and adolescents, are obese. Obesity-related medical conditions cost America nearly $150 billion every year and account for 16-18% of our total healthcare costs (1 in every 6 dollars spent). Only one in three children is physically active every day. Less than 5% of adults participate in 30 minutes of physical activity each day, and only one in three adults receives the recommended amount of physical activity each week. More than 80% of adults do not meet the guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, and more than 80% of adolescents do not do enough aerobic physical activity to meet the guidelines for youth. Children now spend more than seven and a half hours a day in front of a screen (e.g. TV, videogames, computer). There are many factors that have contributed to this epidemic which includes, but is not limited to, lack of time to visit a gym, lack of space, cost, and physical activity viewed as boring. [003] Another trend in America is the elimination of physical education and recess in schools. Years ago, even if a child lived in an area not conducive for outdoor physical activity, they still would achieve their daily suggested level of physical activity participating in school activities. Additionally, when asked, parents would love to bring more physical activity into the home; however, they are usually unsure of how or what to do, resulting in minimal physical activity for the whole family. [004] As can be seen, there is a need for a method and playing apparatus wherein the players perform physical exercises, such that it promotes physical activity in a positive way, is easy to set up and play, and creates laughter, family bonding, learning and developing physical activity skills that leads to a family culture of increased health and wellness. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [005] In one aspect of the present invention, a game comprises a game area including a starting point for each of a plurality of teams; a plurality of game subareas arranged sequentially, each of which designates a physical activity to be performed; an ending point for each of the teams; a die to identify a number of game subareas to be advanced by one of the teams; and a spinner to identify a number of repetitions of the physical activity to be performed by one of the teams. [006] In another aspect of the present invention, a method of playing a game comprises providing a game area or game mat; sequentially arranging a plurality of game squares or game subareas in the game area, wherein each of the game squares has indicia thereon designating a physical activity; setting a starting point and an ending point in the game area for each of a plurality of teams; selecting a number of game squares one team is to advance; selecting a number of repetitions of physical activity the one team is to perform; and ending the game when one of the teams has landed on a game square past an ending point for the one of the teams. [007] These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description and claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [008] Fig. 1 illustrates a top view of a game area according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention including die, game markers and spinners; [009] Fig. 2 illustrates a top close up view of the game area as shown in Fig. 1 ; [010] Fig. 3 illustrates a top view of a spinner card as shown in Fig. 1 ; and [011] Fig. 4 illustrates a flow chart of a method of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [012] The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims. [013] Various inventive features are described below that can each be used independently of one another or in combination with other features. However, any single inventive feature may not address any of the problems discussed above or may only address one of the problems discussed above. Further, one or more of the problems discussed above may not be fully addressed by any of the features described below. [014] Broadly, embodiments of the present invention generally provide a game for promoting physical activity. The disclosure more particularly relates to fitness, and a game method and apparatus for improving cardiovascular endurance, muscle endurance, and flexibility skills by performing various exercises to improve health and wellness in the context of an enjoyable game. [015] Fig. 1 illustrates a game area 101 (such as a surface, mat or board) for a fitness competitive game 100 according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. A game 100 may include the game area 101 with sequential game squares 150. The plurality of game squares 150 may be drawn, printed, appliqued, or otherwise placed in a row around the perimeter of the game area 101 . The game area 101 might also be formed of individual game squares 150 formed in individual pieces and laid upon the game area 101 in an order to form the game area 101 . Directional arrows 160 may be printed on the game area 101 to provide a means to indicate a direction of play. However, any suitable means to designate the direction of play may be used. The game area 101 may be made of material that is easy to fold, store, and use. In an embodiment, the game area 101 may be sized approximately 34" by 46". [016] To play the game, the game area 101 may be placed in an area for play and the players may be divided into a plurality of teams. The number of players in each team may be substantially equal in order to ensure fair play; however, options may allow uneven teams to play as well. Adjacent to the team's starting position 130,131 ,132, or 133, a team's home area or congregation position during the game may be formed and may be designated by a color of the team. Each team may be assigned a die (such as 102), marker (such as 104), and spinner card (such as 108) that may be based on the color of the team. The teams may congregate at their individual congregation position adjacent to the game area 101 and at a distance to the appropriate colored starting position during play of the game. In an embodiment, the teams may be situated directly adjacent from the team's starting position 130, 131 , 132, and 133. The teams may set a predetermined order for their players to play the game. A player with a lowest number assigned to the player from each team may walk or jog to the game area 101 . [017] A player may commence play by rolling a die 102. The teams may play independently from one another. The teams may play simultaneously, or may take turns with other teams. The player may move a team's marker 104 and die 102 a number of squares 150 based upon the roll of the die 102. The team's marker 104 and die 102 may reflect the team's color. The game squares 150 may designate one of different exercises 145 to be performed should a player land on that square 150. A player may communicate to fellow team members the specific physical exercise 145 to be performed such as, for example, "Can Can Crab". A player may determine a number of repetitions of performing the physical exercise by spinning a spinner 106 on a card 108. The card 108 may also state whether the player is to advance or go back a number of squares 150. The players on the team may take turns rolling the die and spinning the spinner 106. All players on the team may together complete the designated exercise, and the amount of repetitions, required from the game square 150 upon which the player landed. A next player in a designated order may roll the team's die and proceed as the first player above. Players on the team may continue to take a turn rolling the die 102 and spinning the spinner 106. Each team may play independent of each other, advancing on the game area 101 only when their individual team completes the amount of repetitions determined by the spinning card 108. A team may advance around the game area 101 and land on a game square 150 past a finish point 105 for the team. After the team completes an exercise 145 named on a game square (such as 150) past the finish point 105, the game 100 may end. [018] Fig. 2 illustrates a close up view of the game area 101 as shown in Fig. 1 . Four teams may play the game, but there could be fewer or more teams depending on an available number of players and space. In an embodiment, a plurality of teams may play for speed in an attempt to defeat each other. Points may be given for performing the physical activities, and tallied. [019] The game area 101 may include start points such as a first start point 130 for first (such as green) team, a second start point 131 for a second (such as yellow) team, a third start point 132 for a third (such as red) team, and a fourth start point 133 for a fourth (such as blue) team. The game area 101 may include a logo 135. Shown at 140 is an example of instructions on a square 150 for a physical activity, in this case, " Alternate kicking legs in air", that a player may communicate to the player's team. Shown at 145 is an example of a name of a physical activity, in this case "Can Can Crab". The plurality of game positions for players to land upon may be provided by game squares 150. Arrows 160 may also be provided to show direction of movement on the game area 101 , and may also help show the start points 130, 131 , 132, and 133, and finish points 105, 1 10, 1 15, and 120. In an embodiment, the start points 130, 131 , 132, and 133 and finish points 105, 1 10, 1 15 and 120 may be individual pieces that may be placed on the game area 101 . [020] Fig. 3 illustrates a repetition spinner card 108 for use on the game area 101 . Each of a plurality of teams, such as four teams, may be given a repetition spinner card 108. In an embodiment, the spinner cards 108 may be approximately 7" in diameter. The repetition spinner card 108 may allow an opportunity for teams to determine a variety of options in terms of completing the repetitions required of an exercise in order to advance on the game area 101 . The spinner card 108 may be placed with each team in their individual team areas. A player may spin a spinner 106 on the spinner card 108 to determine an amount of repetitions or activity a team must do together to advance on the game area 101 . The number of repetitions of the physical activity may be printed on a section 305 of the spinner card 108. A game logo 310 may also be placed on the spinner card 108. There may be, for example, eight options for which the spinner 106 may stop on: • 10 REPS • GO BACK TWO SPACES THEN 15 REPS • 5 REPS • ADVANCE 1 AND 12 REPS • SORRY GO BACK TO START! • ROLL DICE AGAIN DOUBLE AMOUNT FOR REPS! • COUNT 10 REPS BACKWARD • ADVANCE 3 AND 20 REPS These options may be changed for variations in the game. [021] Fig. 4 illustrates a flow chart of a method 400 of the invention. A step 405 may include utilizing a game area (such as board or area 101 ) for players playing in a determined order. For example, two teams - a green team and a red team with two players each - may play the game. A step 410 may include sizing the game area 101 to allow players to walk about a perimeter of the game area 101 . For example, the game area 101 may be sized approximately 34" by 46". The game area 101 may be sized in additional sizes other than 34" by 46" without changing the game. A step 415 may include arranging game subareas (such as game squares 150) with physical activity indicia (such as 145) sequentially such that the indicia can be read from a standing position. For example, the game squares may have physical activity indicia viewable from a standing position such as "Quick Jumps" or "Jog in Place". [022] A step 420 may include setting starting points (such as 130, 131 , 132, or 133), ending points (such as 105, 1 10, 1 15, or 120), and directions of play (such as 160), dice (such as 102), game markers (such as 104) and spinner cards (such as 108) for teams simultaneously or sequentially playing a game (such as 100). For example, a green team may have two players who start at the starting point (such as 130), and end on a square (such as 150) past the ending point (such as 105). The green team may have, for example, a green game marker (such as 103) and a green die (such as 107). [023] A step 425 may include rolling a die and moving a team's marker (such as 103) the number of positions indicated on the die (such as 107). For example, a first member of the green team may roll the die and end up with the number four. The green marker may then be moved from the Green team start (such as 130) in the direction (such as 160) four squares to a square (such as to 150) with "Can Can Crab" noted at the top of the square. [024] A step 430 may include reading a physical activity to be performed on the square landed upon by the team's marker. For example, the first member of the green team may read "Can Can Crab" as the physical activity (such as 145) to be performed, as seen at the top of the square (such as 150). [025] A step 435 may include reading an explanation (such as 140) of the physical activity to be performed (such as 145). In this case, the first member of the green team may read the explanation of how to perform the exercise "Can Can Crab", which may be "Alternate kicking legs in air" as seen at the bottom of the square. [026] A step 440 may include optionally reading a Quick Response Code (QR) code into a mobile phone or other electronic device to retrieve a demonstration of a physical activity or a demonstration of game instructions from a site on the internet. For example, the first member of the green team may read a demonstration of "Alternate kicking legs in air" on a retrieved video from a site on the internet. Retrieving demonstrations of physical activities and game instructions as desired may aid players in playing the game efficiently. [027] A step 445 may include spinning a spinner on a spinner card to determine a number of repetitions of a physical activity to be performed as shown by the section (such as 316) pointed to by the spinner (such as 106) on the spinner card (such as 108). For example, the first member of the green team may spin the spinner and the section (such as 316) on the spinner card may read "10 REPS". [028] A step 450 may include completing a number of repetitions indicated by the spinner card of a physical activity by all members of a team, for example, sit-ups, pushups, or jumping jacks. For example, each member on the green team may do 10 repetitions of "Alternating kicking legs in air". [029] A step 455 may include repeating steps 425 to 450 until a team wins the game 100 by circling the game area 101 one time and completes a physical activity at an area (such as square 156) immediately after a finish point for the team. For example, the following events may complete the game: [030] A first member of the red team may roll a die (step 425) and, for example, roll a five (may be simultaneous with activity of a member of the green team). The first member of the red team may move the red team marker (such as 109) from start (such as 132) five squares to square (such as 161 ) with "Jumping Jacks" at the top of the square. [031] The first member of the red team may read a physical activity (step 430) on the landed square (such as 161 ). In this case, it is "Jumping Jacks", as seen above the square. [032] The first member of the red team may read an explanation of the activity (step 435) at the bottom of the square. The first member of the red team may read "Jump with legs and hands spread, then return to standing position " [033] The first member of the red team may optionally read a Quick Response Code (step 440) from the landed square into a mobile phone. A demonstration of "Jumping Jacks" may be displayed on the mobile phone. In an embodiment, the Quick Response Code for the landed square may be located apart from the game area (such as 101 ). [034] The first member of the red team may spin the spinner (step 445) to determine a number of repetitions of physical activity (such as "Jumping Jacks") that the red team is to perform. The spinner may land on "ADVANCE 3 AND 20 REPS " (such as 305). The first member of the red team may move the red team marker three squares to square (such as 165) with "Foot Dance" at the top of the square. [035] The first member of the red team and the other member(s) of the red team may perform 20 repetitions of "Foot Dance" (step 450). In an embodiment, the players on the red team may perform the 20 repetitions of "Foot Dance" together. [036] The second member of the green team may roll a die (step 425) and may, for example, roll a 6. The second member of the green team may move the Green team marker from the current position of the green team on the game area (101 ) the number of squares on the die. The second member of the green team may land on a square (such as 162) labeled "Standing Crunch" at the top. [037] The second member of the green team may read a physical activity (step 430) on the landed square. The second member of the green team may read "Standing Crunch" from the top of the square. [038] The second member of the green team may read an explanation of an activity (step 435) at the bottom of the square. The second member of the green team may read "Alternate raising knee to opposite elbow" at the bottom of the square. [039] The second member of the green team may optionally read a Quick Response Code (step 440) from the square into a mobile phone. A demonstration of "Alternate raising knee to opposite elbow" may be displayed on the mobile phone using information from a website. In an embodiment, a demonstration of "Alternate raising knee to opposite elbow" may be displayed using other technological means such as electronic devices different from a mobile phone. [040] The second member of the green team may spin the spinner (step 445) to determine the number of repetitions of physical activity (such as 162) to be performed by the green team. The second member of the green team's spinner may, for example, land on "ROLL DICE AGAIN DOUBLE AMOUNT FOR REPS" (such as 312). [041] The second member of the green team may roll the green team's assigned die, such as a green color die (step 425) again and may, for example, roll a 6. The second member of the green team may inform the green team that they need to perform double the amount of repetitions as on the die, that is, 12 repetitions of the physical activity "Alternate raising knee to opposite elbow". [042] The second player on the red team may roll a die (step 425) and may, for example, roll a 6. The second player on the red team may move the red team marker from current position of the red team on the game area (such as 101 ) the number of squares on the die. The second player on the red team may land on a square (such as 150) labeled "Can Can Crab" on top. [043] The second player on the red team may read a physical activity (step 430) on the landed square. In this case, it is "Can Can Crab", as seen at the top of the square. [044] The second player on the red team may read an explanation of activity (step 435) at the bottom of the square (such as 140). The second player on the red team may read "Alternate kicking legs in air" at the bottom of the square. [045] The second player on the red team may optionally read a Quick Response Code (step 440) from the landed square (such as 150) into a mobile phone. A demonstration of "Alternate kicking legs in air" may be displayed on the mobile phone from a website. [046] The second player on the red team may spin the spinner (step 445) to determine number of repetitions of physical activity (such as 140) to be performed. The second player on the red team may land on "5 REPS" (such as 31 1 ). [047] The red team may perform 5 repetitions of "Alternate kicking legs in air" (step 450). [048] The first member of the green team may roll the green team's assigned die, such as a green colored die (step 425) again and may, for example, roll a 6. The first member of the green team may move the green team marker from the current position of green team on the game area (such as 101 ) to a square (such as 175) labeled "Squats" at the top of the square. [049] The first member of the green team may read a physical activity (step 430) on landed square. The first member of the green team may read "Squats" from the top of the square. [050] The first member of the green team may read an explanation of activity (step 435) at the bottom of the square. The second member of the green team may read "Bend knees and lower body, then return to upright position" at the bottom of the square labeled "Squats". [051] The first member of the green team may optionally read a Quick Response Code (step 440) from the square into a mobile phone. A demonstration of "Squats" may be displayed on the mobile phone from a website. [052] The first member of the green team may spin the spinner (step 445) to determine a number of repetitions of physical activity (such as 175) to be performed. The spinner may, for example, land on "10 REPS" (such as 316). [053] The green team may perform the physical activity (step 450) the number of repetitions on the spinner card. The green team may do "Bend knees and lower body then return to upright position" 10 times. [054] The first player on the red team may roll a die (step 425) and may, for example, roll a 6. The first player on the red team may move the red team marker from current position of the red team on the game area (such as 101 ) the number of squares on the die. The first player on the red team may land on a square (such as 162) labeled "Standing Crunch" on top. [055] The first player on the red team may read a physical activity (step 430) on the landed square. In this case, it is "Standing Crunch", as seen at the top of the square. [056] The first player on the red team may read an explanation of activity (step 435) at the bottom of the square (such as 162). The first player on the red team may read "Alternate raising knee to opposite elbow" at the bottom of the square. [057] The first player on the red team may optionally read a Quick Response Code (step 440) from the landed square (such as 162) into a mobile phone. A demonstration of "Alternate raising knee to opposite elbow" may be displayed on the mobile phone from a website. [058] The first player on the red team may spin the spinner (step 445) to determine number of repetitions of physical activity (such as "Alternate raising knee to opposite elbow") to be performed. The first player on the red team may land on "5 REPS" (such as 31 1 ). [059] The first member of the red team may inform the red team that they need to perform 5 repetitions of the physical activity "Alternate raising knee to opposite elbow". The red team may together perform 5 repetitions of "Alternate raising knee to opposite elbow" (step 450). [060] The second member of the green team may roll the die (step 425) and may, for example, roll a 5. The second member of the green team may move the green team's marker from the current position of the green team a number of squares as shown on the rolled die. The second member of the green team may land on a square (such as 156) labeled "Hand to toe touch" at the top of the square. [061] The second member of the green team may read a physical activity (such as 158) on the landed square (step 430), and may read "Hand to toe touch" from the top of the square. [062] The second member of the green team may read an explanation of activity (step 435) at the bottom of the landed square. The second member of the green team may read "Sitting on the floor, alternate touching opposite foot to hand" at the bottom of the square labeled "Hand to toe touch". [063] The second member of the green team may optionally read a Quick Response Code (step 440) from the square (such as 156) into a mobile phone. A demonstration of "Sitting on the floor, alternate touching opposite foot to hand" may be displayed on the mobile phone from a website.
