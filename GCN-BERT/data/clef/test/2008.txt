TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel sulfonamide compounds having TRPM8 antagonistic activity which are useful as medicaments. BACKGROUND ART TRP (transient receptor potential) channels are non-selective cation channels that are activated by a variety of physical (e.g., temperature, osmolality, or mechanical) and chemical stimuli. A subset of the TRP channel superfamily is thermoresponsive, each channel being activated over a discrete temperature range, cumulatively spanning from noxious cold to noxious heat. TRPM8 belongs to the melastatin subgroup of the TRP channel superfamily, TRPM8 is sensitive to cold temperature and menthol, and therefore also called as cold menthol receptor-1 (CMR-1). TRPM8 is known to be stimulated by cold, temperatures (8 to 28° C.) as well as by chemical substances such as menthol and icilin (e.g., Nonpatent Document 1). TRPM8 is mainly located on primary nociceptive neurons (A-δ and C-fibers) and is also modulated by inflammation-mediated second messengers (e.g., Nonpatent Documents 2 and 3). The location of TRPM8 on both A-δ and C-fibers may provide a basis for abnormal cold sensitivity in pathologic conditions wherein these neurons are altered, resulting in pain, often of a burning nature. TRPM8 immunostaining in primary afferents was increased in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCD, a neuropathic pain model manifesting cold allodynia in hindlimbs (e.g., Nonpatent Document 4). The expression of TRPM8 in primary afferents was increased in oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia model in mice (e.g., Nonpatent Document 5). Cold intolerance and paradoxical burning sensations induced by chemical substances or thermal cooling are closely parallel symptoms seen in a wide range of clinical disorders and thus provide a strong rationale for the development on TRPMS modulators as novel antihyperalgesic or antiallodynic agents. TRPMS is also known to be expressed in the brain, lung, bladder, gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, prostate and immune cells, thereby providing the possibility for therapeutic modulation in a variety of maladies. N-Benzothiophenylsulfonamide compounds (e.g., Patent Document 1), N-benzimidazolylsulfonamide compounds (e.g., Patent Document 2), N-phenylsulfonamide compounds, and N-pyridylsulfonamide compounds (e.g., Patent Document 3), etc. have been known, as a TRPM8 modulator. However, it has never been reported that a compound having a structure in which isoquinolyl binds to a sulfonylamino group has a TRPM8 antagonistic activity.

TRPM8 inhibition assay Test Compound: The compounds of the above Examples were used in a TRPM8 inhibition assay. Method: The functional activity of a test compound was determined by measuring change in intracellular calcium concentration using a calcium sensitive fluorescent dye. The change in fluorescent signal was measured by the cell imaging technology by Hamamatsu Photonics's Functional Drag Screening System (FDSS). Increase in intracellular calcium concentration was readily detected upon activation with menthol. HEK293 cells stably expressing human TRPM8 were grown in a flask. On assay day, the culture medium was removed from the flask, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested with PBS containing 2 mmol/L of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na). The cells were then incubated with assay solution containing 3 μmol/L of Fura-2AM and 0.01% Pluronic F-127 for 60 minutes. Subsequently, suspended 20,000 to 50,000 cells per well were incubated with a test compound (at varying concentrations) in each well at 37° C. for 20 minutes. Change in intracellular calcium concentration evoked by 100 μmol/L of menthol was measured for 2 minutes using FDSS. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50 value) was determined from four-point concentration-response studies. The concentration-response curve was generated using the average of quadruplicate wells for each data point. Results: The following Table 17 shows an IC50 value of each test compound.

A rat exhibits shaking behavior in response to menthol, a TRPM8 agonist, Pretreatment of a rat with a TRPM8 antagonist prior to menthol administration inhibits the observed shaking behavior. To assess the activity of a TRPM8 antagonist to inhibit menthol-induced shaking behavior in a Sprague Dawley (SD) male rat, each test compound (3 mg/kg, oral administration, a solution in 0.5% methylcellulose; N=3-4/group) was administered 1, 2, or 4 hours prior to menthol challenge (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal administration, in 10% Macrogol 15 Hydroxystearate/physiological saline solution). Spontaneous WDS were counted for 5 minutes post menthol dosing. Inhibition of the spontaneous WDS behavior relative to vehicle pretreatment is expressed as percent (%) inhibition, calculated as follows: [in-line-formulae]% inhibition=[1-(WDS count in the group treated with a test compound/WDS count in the group treated with vehicle)]×100.[/in-line-formulae] INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The compound of the formula (I) of the present invention is useful for the prevention and treatment of various diseases involving TRPM8 (e.g., a chronic pain such as neuropathic pain (preferably, neuropathic pain caused by cold allodynia or diabetic neuropathy)). 1.
