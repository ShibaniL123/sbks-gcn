FAT COMPOSITION AND FAT BLEND This invention relates to a fat composition, to a fat blend comprising the composition, and to confectionery products. Triglyceride fats are used extensively in the confectionery industry. Many fats require a tempering step to convert the fat into the most stable crystalline form. Chocolate is composed of triglycerides in unstable polymorphic crystal forms and has a tendency to undergo physical changes associated with the transitions of the unstable forms into a more stable form. These physical changes are likely to affect adversely the appearance and/or texture of the chocolate. Depending on the process conditions used, cocoa butter can be crystallized into different crystal forms, each of which possess a distinct melting point and density. The purpose of tempering is to produce sufficient, uniform seed crystals to ensure that the temper state is stable and that subsequent crystallisation of the whole of the chocolate mass occurs into the stable crystalline form. Properly tempered chocolate is important for qualities such as mould release (contraction), hardness, snap, mouthfeel, flavour release, gloss and resistance to fat bloom. Similarly, some fats intended to replace cocoa butter in chocolate-like confectionery need to be tempered for the same reasons. Crystallisation starters are frequently added to triglyceride fats in order to facilitate tempering of the fats. Modern Technology of Confectionery Industries with Formulae & Processes, Minni Jha, 2003, Asia Pacific Business Press Inc, 8178330997, page 208 describes crystallisation starters as being high melting triglycerides with a melting point of 55 °C to 70 °C, which, when included in a fat in a proportion of 2.5 to 3.0 % aid the tempering procedure. The crystallisation starter forms crystals as the fat is cooled from the molten state and these crystals allow the fat to be produced in the desired polymorphic crystal form. EP-A-803196 discloses a hard butter additive composition comprising the middle melting point fraction of random interesterified palm stearin. The hard butter additive composition is used to prevent fat blooming and/or graining and improve mold removability of hard butter products such as chocolate or centre cream without a tempering process. WO 2012/084420 describes a water-in-oil emulsion comprising 50 to 85 wt. % of an aqueous phase and 15 to 50 wt. % of a fat phase, wherein the fat phase comprises HOH triglycerides in an amount of 8 to 50 % of the total weight of the fat phase, and HHH triglycerides in an amount of 1 to 6 % of the total weight of the fat phase, wherein at least 25 % of said HHH triglycerides contain at least two different fatty acid residues, where "H" denotes a saturated fatty acid residue with 16 to 24 carbon atoms and "O" an oleic acid residue. Our copending European patent application no 13275192.6 filed on 22 August 2013 relates to a fat composition that can be used as a crystallization starter and which comprises: greater than 70 % by weight palmitic acid; and from 2 to 12 % by weight P20 triglycerides (i.e., triglycerides having two palmitoyl groups and one oleoyl group, PPO and POP), wherein P is palmitic acid and O is oleic acid; wherein the fat composition has a weight ratio of SSO:SOS triglycerides of greater than 0.3, and wherein S is stearic or palmitic acid and O is oleic acid. Often, food products that contain liquid oils also contain a structuring agent. Structuring agents are generally fats that are solid at room temperature (20 °C) and that provide structure to the oil phase. For example, some confectionery filling fats are mixtures of liquid oil and a structuring agent with the structuring agent providing a degree of firmness to the mixture by virtue of forming a crystal network in the liquid oil phase. There remains a need for fat compositions that can be used as crystallization starters that can improve the crystallization of fat or fat blends in confectionery or bakery applications without adversely affecting the desirable properties of the fat or fat blends. In particular, there is a need for crystallization starters that are based on non- hydrogenated fats. There is also a need for crystallization starters having these advantages that can provide a structuring effect In a liquid oil or fat. According to the present invention, there is provided a fat composition comprising: greater than 75 % by weight palmitic acid and stearic acids; from 1 to 25 % by weight oleic acid; and greater than 20 % by weight of combined P2St and PSt2 triglycerides, wherein P is palmitic acid and St is stearic acid; wherein the fat composition has a weight ratio of P2St:PPP triglycerides of greater than 0.5. Also provided by the invention is a fat blend comprising from 0.5 to 10 % by weight of the fat composition of the invention. A further aspect of the invention is a process for making the fat composition of the invention comprising the following steps: (a) providing a palm oil stearin (preferably by fractionating palm oil) having an iodine value (IV) of from 10 to 40; (b) interesterifying the palm oil stearin of step (a) with a source of stearic acid; and (c) fractionating the interesterified product of step (b) to produce a stearin fraction at a yield based on the interesterified product of step (b) of from 8 to 25 % by weight.

The fat composition of the invention comprises greater than 75 % by weight in total of palmitic acid and stearic acids. Most if not all of the palmitic and stearic acids are present in covalently bonded form in glycerides (i.e., triglycerides and any mono- and di-glycerides that might be present).

Interesteriflcation may be carried out, for example, chemically using catalysts, such as bases (e.g., sodium methoxide), or enzymatically e.g., using a lipase e.g., from Rhizopus or zae or Thermomyces lanuginosus. Fractionation of fats and oils into higher and lower melting fractions is a technique that is well-known to those skilled in the art. The lower melting fraction is termed an olein and the higher melting fraction is called a stearin. Fractionation may be carried out in the presence of a solvent (wet), such as acetone, or without a solvent (dry).

In other words, the fat composition may be used as a crystallization starter. Surprisingly, not only does the fat composition of the invention perform as a crystallization starter, it can also provide structuring properties in the fat blend. Consequently, the hardness of the fat blend can be increased, making it more useful in certain food applications. The fat blend may have a hardness at 20 °C that is greater than that of the one or more fats in the blend without the composition of the invention. The fat composition and fat blend of the invention may be used in a confectionery product. The confectionery product of the invention comprises at least 20% by weight of the fat blend according to the invention and at least 30 % by weight sugar.

The confectionery products may also be used as coatings on products that are sold and/or consumed at ambient temperature (i.e., from 5 to 30 °C). The confectionery products may be used to apply a partial or complete coating to a base product which is preferably a bakery product. Bakery products are typically baked in an oven. The bakery products are preferably made using flour. Examples of bakery products include biscuits, cookies, cakes, donuts and pastries. Cupcakes are particularly preferred examples of baked confectionery products for the invention. Coated bakery products can be produced by melting the confectionery product (e.g., above 35 °C), applying it to an uncoated bakery product (e.g., by pouring it onto the uncoated bakery product or by immersing the uncoated bakery product in it) and lowering the temperature to solidify the confectionery product by allowing it to cool (or by forced cooling). Suitable methods are well-known to those skilled in the art. The coated bakery products may be further decorated with ingredients that adhere to the coating such as icing and/or chocolate strands or chips or sugar strands (which can be of a single colour or multi-coloured). Confectionery products may also be coated with a composition of the invention. Suitable confectionery products include chocolates, chocolate-like products and jellies. The listing or discussion of an apparently prior-published document in this specification should not necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that the document is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge. Preferences and options for a given aspect, embodiment, feature or parameter of the invention should, unless the context indicates otherwise, be regarded as having been disclosed in combination with any and all preferences and options for all other aspects, embodiments, features and parameters of the invention. For example, the preferred features of the fat composition may be applied when the fat composition is used in the fat blend of the invention and the preferred features of the fat blend may be applied when the fat blend is used in the confectionery product. The following non-limiting examples illustrate the invention and do not limit its scope in any way. In the examples and throughout this specification, all percentages, parts and ratios are by weight unless indicated otherwise. EXAMPLES Example 1 About 1200 gram of a blend of 40 % by weight palm stearin with an iodine value of 14 and 60 % by weight shea olein was chemically interesterified using sodium methoxide. The interesterified blend was dry fractionated at 40°C. The oil was first heated to 70°C and then cooled down to 35°C to 45°C as follows: from 70°C down to 40°C to 47°C in 3 to 7 hours, hold for 2 to 8 hours at 40°C to 47°C and cooled further to 35°C to 45°C in 5 to 10 hours and hold at this temperature for 5 to 10 hours. The crystals formed were separated by means of filter pressing. The slurry was pressed using the following program: increase pressure from 0 - 24 bar in 60 min and squeeze 24 bar for 30 min. In this way, about 19% stearin yield was obtained. The analytical results are shown in Table 1 (Product 1). This stearin fraction is suitable for replacing hydrogenated palm oil 60 (hPO60) as crystallization/structuring agent. Example 2 About 890 gram of a blend of 80 % by weight palm stearin with an iodine value of 34 and 20 % by weight shea olein was chemically interesterified using sodium methoxide. The interesterified blend was dry fractionated at 37°C to 45°C. The oil was first heated to 70°C and then cooled down to 37°C to 45°C as follows: from 70°C down to 48°C to 52°C in 1 to 5 hours, hold for 2 to 6 hours at 48°C to 52°C and cooled further to 37°C to 45°C in 5 to 10 hours and hold at this temperature for 5 to 10 hours. The crystals formed were separated by means of filter pressing. The slurry was pressed using the following program: increase pressure from 0 - 24 bar in 60 min and squeeze 24 bar for 30 min. In this way, about 20% stearin yield was obtained. The analytical results are shown in Table 1 (Product 2). This stearin fraction is suitable for replacing hydrogenated palm oil 60 (hPO60) as crystallization/ structuring agent. Example 3 About 1200 gram of a mixture of 50 % by weight palm oil mid fraction (PMF IV34) and 50 % by weight stearic acid was interesterified, which reaction was catalyzed by a 1 ,3- specific lipase derived from Rhizopus oryzae. The interesterified PMF (in(PMFIV34)) was solvent fractionated using acetone as solvent at 20°C to 25°C. The solvent/oil mixture was cooled down to 20°C to 25°C, while stirring. Formed crystals were filtered off and the solvent was evaporated by means of distillation. The top stearin fraction obtained (about 10 % yield) could be used as an alternative for hydrogenated palm oil (hPO 60). The analytical results are shown in Table 1 (Product 3). Table 1 .

Palm olein with iodine value of 64 was used as liquid oil. To 120 gram POflV64 was added 3% (wt) of the Products 1 - 3. The oil blend was heated to 60°C followed by cooling down to room temperature. The cooled samples were stored for 3 days at 10°C. The samples were measured using a Brookfield texture analyzer. Samples were taken from the refrigerator (10°C) and penetrated once with a 12.7 mm diameter plastic cylindrical probe. The maximal force (measured in compression) was recorded and mentioned as maximal hardness. The speed and distance of penetration were set to 2.0 mm/s and 10 mm, respectively.
