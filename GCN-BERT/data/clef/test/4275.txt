Step 3: Synthesis of 4-(4-(4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)ethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)butanamide
To a solution of 4-(4-(4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)ethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoic acid (190 mg, 1 eq) in DMF (10 ml) was added with HATU (210 mg, 1.4 eq), HOBT (85 mg, 1.4 eq), Et3N (0.17 ml, 3 eq), O-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (121 mg, 2 eq) and stirred for 1 hr at room temperature. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (200 mg, 87%).
