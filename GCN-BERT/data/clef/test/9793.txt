Pharmaceutical Composition FIELD OF INVENTION: The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an integrase inhibitor, and more particularly, relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising dolutegravir, a process for preparing such pharmaceutical composition, and its use in the treatment of FflV infections. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART: One of the major obstacles to the development of highly potent pharmaceutical formulations is the poor water solubility of many drugs. Approximately 40% of potential drugs identified by pharmaceutical companies are poorly soluble in water, which greatly hinders their clinical use. Low water solubility limits the bioavailability and absorption of these agents. Dolutegravir has the chemical name (4R,12aS)-N-(2,4-difluorobenzyl)-7-hydroxy-4- methyl-6,8-dioxo-3 ,4,6,8, 12,12a-hexahydro-2H-pyrido[r,2':4,5]pyrazino[2,l -b][l,3] oxazine-9-carboxamide, and is reported to have the following chemical structure. Dolutegravir is an orally active integrase inhibitor, and has been approved for the treatment of FflV infections. The human immunodeficiency virus ("HIV") is the causative agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ("AIDS"), a disease characterized by the destruction of the immune system, particularly of CD4 T-cells with susceptibility to opportunistic infections. In nearly all cases where individuals receive no treatment for HIV infection, the proliferation of the virus gives rise to AIDS. As of early 1999, an estimated 33.4 million people are infected with HIV worldwide. Furthermore, in 2009 approximately 50,000 people were newly infected with HIV in the United States [Prejean J, Song R, Hernandez A, et al. Estimated HIV incidence in the United States, 2006-2009. PLoS ONE 2011; 6(8):el7502 It has also been observed that the annual rate of new infection with HIV in the entire human population has not declined. Despite this fact, the rate of death due to AIDS has begun to drop in some nations primarily through the recent use of combination drug therapies against HIV infection. The means by which such therapies counter HIV infection is best understood with reference to the biological mechanisms of the HIV life cycle. HIV is a member of a class of infectious agents known as retroviruses. The infectious form of HIV, a virion, is a particle that consists of a viral genome composed of RNA that is surrounded by proteins encoded by the genome. Infection occurs when an HIV virion enters a susceptible host cell, such as a T lymphocyte within the bloodstream. At this point, one of the viral proteins that comprise the virion, reverse transcriptase, synthesizes a double-stranded DNA copy of the HIV RNA genome. The resulting HIV DNA enters the cell nucleus as part of a stable complex with other virion proteins. This complex contains all the necessary molecular apparatus for integration wherein the HIV DNA is covalently inserted into the host cell's genomic DNA which is absolutely required for prolific HIV infection. It is only after integration that the HIV DNA can serve as the template for the production of HIV proteins and RNA that will comprise progeny virions. Among these viral proteins is the HIV protease, the activity of which is necessary for proper formation of new virions. This process, from viral entry to new virion production, is termed viral replication. Upon release from an infected host cell, the newly produced virions are capable of further infecting uninfected host cells. It is through successive rounds of HIV replication and productive host cell infection that FHV disease spreads throughout numerous host cells and ultimately progresses to AIDS. Dolutegravir is a FflV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor which inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. Dolutegravir is commercially available as conventional tablet (TIVICAY®) for oral administration. TIVICAY® is available as a tablet containing 50 mg of dolutegravir per tablet. Dolutegravir exhibits very slight water solubility. According to the Bio-pharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), it has been classified as a Class II drug, implying that it is a poorly soluble, and a highly permeable drug. The oral bioavailability of this class of drugs is generally limited during the dissolution phenomenon when administered in the final dosage form. Further, the bioavailability of dolutegravir depends upon the meal content. It has been observed that administration of low, moderate, and high fat meals exhibit increased AUC(o-oo) by 33%, 41%, and 66% respectively, increased Cmax by 46%, 52%, and 67% respectively and prolonged Tmax to 3, 4, and 5 hours respectively from 2 hours under fasted conditions. Dolutegravir has been first disclosed specifically in EP1874117 and its use in the treatment of HIV infections has also been disclosed. WO2011094150 discloses a combination of dolutegravir with other therapeutic agents such as abacavir, efavirenz, and lopinavir. The prior art discloses the use of dolutegravir for the treatment of HIV as well as is combinations with few antiretroviral agents. However, problems that are associated with the solubility and bioavailability of dolutegravir are yet to be addressed to yield the best bioavailability and a better ADME profile. Generally, several strategies and formulations are known and have been employed to overcome these limitations of solubility and bioavailability of drugs that are associated with food. Food effect exhibited by the drug is also a limiting factor which has to be addressed to some extent. Although strategies such as complexing drugs with cyclodextrins, conjugation to dendrimers, salt formation of ionizable drugs and the use of co-solvents have been shown to improve drug solubility, solubilization methods that can improve the absorption of the drug are still highly desirable. Hence, there is a need for a dosage form which would exhibit acceptable dissolution and absorption which leads to better bioavailability.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION: For the treatment of diseases caused by retroviruses, especially Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or an HW infection, it is essential that maximum amount of drug reaches the site of action. Most antiretroviral drugs either have poor solubility or poor permeability which deteriorates the bioavailability of the drug to a major extent. Dolutegravir is a highly potent integrase inhibitor which is widely used in the treatment of diseases caused by retroviruses, especially acquired immune deficiency syndrome or an HIV infection. However, dolutegravir being a BCS class II drug exhibits very slight water solubility, which, in turn, causes it to demonstrate low bioavailability. Thus there is a dire need to develop suitable pharmaceutical compositions which address the bioavailability issues of dolutegravir. The recommended dosage of dolutegravir is about 50 mg once daily, and this dose may be adjusted up to a maximum of 50 mg twice daily in certain cases. The inventors of the present invention have found ways to address the solubility problems of dolutegravir. In particular, the inventors have found that, the solubility properties of dolutegravir are improved by using nanosized dolutegravir thus leading to better bioavailability of the drug. The term "Dolutegravir" is used in broad sense to include not only "Dolutegravir" per se but also its pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, pharmaceutically acceptable anhydrates, pharmaceutically acceptable enantiomers, pharmaceutically acceptable esters, pharmaceutically acceptable isomers, pharmaceutically acceptable polymorphs, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, pharmaceutically acceptable tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable complexes etc. Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprises dolutegravir in the form of dolutegravir sodium or dolutegravir potassium. The term "low dose" as used herein refers to a therapeutically effective dose of dolutegravir, which dose is less than the usual or the conventional dose required to produce equal or higher therapeutic effect. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical composition, according to the present invention may be administered once or twice a day. Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is administered once a day in a low dose wherein a "low dose" is less than the conventionally administered dose. Such low dose may be from about 5 mg to about 75 mg, preferably from about 10 mg to about 50 mg, most preferably from about 15 mg to about 40 mg. The conventional dose of TrVICAY®, the current trade name for dolutegravir, is 50 mg. Further, the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may be administered as a pediatric formulation wherein the dose of such formulation may be from about 5 mg to about 20 mg, preferably less than about 15 mg. Nanonization of hydrophobic or poorly water-soluble drugs generally involves the production of drug nanocrystals through either chemical precipitation (bottom-up technology) or disintegration (top-down technology). Different methods may be utilized to reduce the particle size of the hydrophobic or poorly water soluble drugs. [Huabing Chen et ah, discusses the various methods to develop nanoformulations in "Nanonization strategies for poorly water-soluble drugs," Drug Discovery Today, Volume 00, Number 00, March 2010]. The present invention thus provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising dolutegravir in the form of nanoparticles. The term "nanosize" as used herein refers to dolutegravir particles having an average particle size of less than or equal to about 2000 nm, preferably less than or equal to about 1000 nm.
