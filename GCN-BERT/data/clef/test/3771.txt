2 '7665 This invention relates to watering cans or containers and particularly to collapsible containers of this class; and the object of the invention is to provide a device of the class specifled which is so constructed as to permit of the collapsing or folding thereof into a compact package when not in use; a further object being to construct a container of the class specified of waterproof material, and preferably a waterproofed fabric having more or less body or rigidity whereby when the device is filled or partially filled with water or the like, the game will assume a predetermined shape or form; a further object being to provide a flexible discharge member for said container and with means for holding said discharge member in a vertical position as well as to provide a suitable bail or handle member for the container, and - - ...... means for attaching a strap member or strap members thereto; and .. -: with these and other objects in view, the invention consìsts in a device of the class and for the purpose specified, which is simple in construction, efficient in use and which is constructed -. as hereinafter described and claimed. " ...... :" The invention is fully disclosed in the following specification, of which the accompanying drawing forms a part, in which the separate Parts of my improvement are designated by suitable reference characters in each of the views, and in which:- Fig. 1 is a perspective iew of my improved container in an extended and operat ive posit ion. Fig. 2 is a partial section on the line 2-2 of Fig. l. Fig. õ is a side view of the complete device in a folded or collapsed position; and, Fig. 4 is a side and sectional view of a part of the construct ion shown in Fig. 2 and showing a modification« r,r 24«ofi5 In practice, I provide a container 5 in the substantial form of a pail or bucket and which is preferably composed of strong and durable fabric, such for example as canvas treated to render the same waterproof. The container 5 is open at the top, and said opening is closed s greater portion of its area by a transverse fabric member 6, which is cut out to form an aperture 7 opening into the container 5. Secured to the top rim portion of the container 5 adjacent to the aperture 7 is a U-shaped mere- :.:: iiii:i::': i ::: iiii:iiiiiii:i: ber 8, and mounted in connection with the bottom of the container ....i i:.i"!:-. .:... in vertical alinement with the member 8 is a nipple 9 with which .: a flexible discharge member i0 is coupled, and in the construction :'.

In : :: filling the container 5, the sprinkler head ii or the neck portion 1::: :': %1 :: 12 thereof is passed over the U-shaped member 8, and supported in ..... an upright vertical position thereby.

When the container 5 is not in use ,r when i is desired ..... to ship or carry the same from place to place, the container pro- ..... . i.:/. per is folded or rolled into a compact package, and the discharge :: member i0 is brought into parallel relation with the folded container as clearly shown in Fig. 3 of the drawing. When it is ...... " desired to use the container, the same is extended from ifs folded position and water or other liquid is inserted thereinto through the aperture 7, in which operation the container is extended to substantially pail or bucket formation, and by reason of the J rigidity of the fabric employed, the container 5 will assume a shape substantially similar to that shown in Fig. 1 of the drawing. In the above named operation, it will be understood that the sprinkler head is mounted in connection with the member 8. The container may now .be carries by the bail or strap member 15 or by both if desire to any predetermined point, and the water discharged from the container through the sprinkler head ll by simply lowering the same into a position similar to that shown in Fig. l. The device above described may be used as a garden sprinkler or for any other purpose, and the top flexible wall 6, serves to prevent the splashing of the water or the'dlscharge of the water by splashing from the container in carrying the same about • .k . In Fig. ê of the drawing, I have shown a slight modlfloat ion in which I substitute for the sprinkler head ii a plain discharge nozzle 17 having laterally projecting arms 18 to acilirate its mounting in connection with the member 8, and I have - also shown a clamp device 19 mounted on the tubular discharge .... member 10, whereby the flow of water therethroagh may be c ontrolleè, ....... the member 19 acting as a valve as will be apparent and if desired, any type of valve or other means for controlling the discharge through the member• l0 may be employed. With the construction shown in Fig. 4, the device may be used as a watering pail or can and a very effective use of this device will be as an automobile accessory, the container .o being used for collecting and carrying water for the radiator of the vehicle or for other purposes, and by reason of the ability of folding the entire device into a compact package, the same will take up but little room in the tool box or other coin- ú'i partment of a motor vehicle. It will be understood that while I have shown and described certain details of construction for carryìng my invention into effect ana have referred to the specific uses thereof, that my invention is net necessarily limited in these respects, and various changes in and modifications of the construction herein shown and deBcrlbed may be made within the scope of the 'appended claims without departing from the spirit of my invention or sacrlflcing its advantages.
