JAW ELECTRODES PARTIALLY COVERED WITH AN INSULATING SHIELD FIELD [0001] The present disclosure relates to surgical devices, and more particular, surgical devices having opposed members that may be used for gripping or applying a current. BACKGROUND [0002] The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior art. [0003] Surgical forceps or tweezers are used in various applications during medical therapy procedures. Such devices are commonly used for holding or gripping objects. [0004] Recently, medical practitioners have also used bipolar forceps and tweezers during surgical procedures. Bipolar forceps and tweezers may be used to seal vessels by delivering pulsed bipolar energy to coagulate nearby tissue, which may replace or minimize the need for sutures and staples. [0005] Thermal margin, thermal injury and re-grasp may present issues when using electrosurgical devices, such as electrosurgical forceps. The thermal margin is the heat spread during coagulation to cause excess tissue effect. For example, energy may emanate from the non-active surfaces of the electrode, or the outside faces, which may cause the thermal margin to reach beyond the area intended to be treated. Thermal injury may be caused by residual heat on the jaws after a coagulation cycle. Residual heat on the jaws could cause unwanted injury if the jaws contact surrounding tissue and/or organs. Re-grasp involves the electrical short between a pair of jaw electrodes when treating thin tissues. Such shorting typically turns on a "re- grasp" alarm and shuts down the coagulation function. [0006] Accordingly, there exists a need for electrosurgical devices that limit excess thermal margin, thermal injury, and electrical shorting or re- grasp. SUMMARY [0007] The present disclosure provides an electrosurgical device having a pair of electrosurgical jaws and an insulating shield system. The insulating shield system may be configured to prevent excess thermal margin, thermal injury, and/or electrical short or re-grasp. [0008] Accordingly, pursuant to one aspect of the invention, there is contemplated an electrosurgical device comprising a pair of jaws including a first jaw and a second jaw. The second jaw is disposed adjacent to the first jaw, and the pair of jaws is movable between an open position and a closed position. The first jaw comprises a first electrode, and the second jaw comprises a second electrode. The first jaw has a first jaw active surface, and the second jaw has a second jaw active surface. The first jaw active surface is disposed adjacent to the second jaw active surface in the closed position. The first jaw has a first jaw first side surface and a first jaw second side surface. The first jaw first side surface is disposed adjacent to a first side of the first jaw active surface, and the first jaw second side surface is disposed adjacent to a second side of the first jaw active surface. The second jaw has a second jaw first side surface and a second jaw second side surface. The second jaw first side surface is disposed adjacent to a first side of the second jaw active surface, and the second jaw second side surface is disposed adjacent to a second side of the second jaw active surface. An actuating member is coupled to at least one of the first and second jaws. The actuating member is configured to move the pair of jaws between the open position and the closed position. A first insulating shield system is disposed on the first jaw first side surface and the first jaw second side surface. The first insulating shield system includes an insulating material. The first jaw active surface has a first jaw first portion covered by the first insulating shield system and a first jaw second portion at least substantially free from contact with the first insulating shield system.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0024] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. [0025] The present disclosure provides an electrosurgical device having a pair of electrosurgical jaws and an insulating shield system. The insulating shield system may be configured to prevent excess thermal margin, thermal injury, and/or electrical short or re-grasp. [0026] For example, referring to FIG. 1 , an electrosurgical forceps is illustrated and generally designated at 20. The forceps 20 are of the electrosurgical type that may be used as a bipolar device, for example, to apply pulsed or non-pulsed energy to coagulate a tissue. The electrosurgical forceps 20 may be used, for example, in percutaneous laparoscopic surgical procedures. [0027] The electrosurgical forceps 20 may include an elongate tubular outer member 22, which may be formed from a variety of materials, such as stainless steel. The outer member 22 has a proximal end 24, a distal end 26, and a lumen 28 extending along the length of the outer member 22. A coagulating jaw arrangement 30 extends from the distal end 26 of the outer member 22. [0028] A handle 32 is located at the proximal end 24 of the outer member 22. The handle 32 includes a lever 34 that may be pressed to actuate the coagulating jaws 36, 38 of the jaw arrangement 30. The lever 34 may be pivotally secured to the device 20 through a pivot pin 40. A torsion spring (partially shown at numeral 42) is located in the handle 32 and acts as a biasing means to provide a return force for the lever 34. [0029] A first conductive electrical lead part 44 is connected to, or integrally formed with, the first forceps jaw 36, and a second conductive electrical lead part 46 is connected to, or integrally formed with, the second forceps jaw 38. The conductive lead parts 44, 46 are electrically connected to a pair of insulated electrical leads 48, 50 extending from an electrical connector 52 disposed on the handle 32; thus, the lead parts 44, 46 may be connected to, or formed with, wires or other conductive parts (not shown) that extend through the length of the outer member 22 and through the handle 32 to the insulated leads 48, 50. The leads 48, 50 are configured to be connected to a source of RF power (not shown). [0030] In some versions, a thumb slide 54 may be included at the top of the handle 32 for selecting a unidirectional or bidirectional mode of the forceps movement. For example, the thumb slide 54 may be moved into a first position for unidirectional movement of the jaw arrangement 30, wherein each jaw 36, 38 can only move toward each other to close on the tissue to be grasped and coagulated. In the unidirectional mode, if pressure on the lever 34 is released, the jaws 36, 38 remain in the position they were in when the pressure was released. The thumb slide 54 may be moved into a second position for bidirectional movement of the jaw arrangement 30, wherein the jaws 36, 38 can move in both directions to close or open. In the bidirectional mode, when the lever 34 is released, the jaws 36, 38 open under the influence of the return spring 42. [0031] An inner tubular member 56 is connected to a clevis pin arrangement 57, which is coupled to the lever 34 through a slot 58 formed in an upper part of the lever 34. The inner tubular member 56 extends through the outer member 22 and is coupled to the first and second jaws 36, 38 through the arcuate leads 44, 46 at the distal end 26 of the outer member 22. The lever 34 is configured to move the inner tubular member 56 in an axial direction. Accordingly, the arcuate leads 44, 46 are moved into and out of them lumen 28 of the outer member 22, and/or the arcuate leads 44, 46 may be moved into and out of the inner member 56 or another sleeve to squeeze the leads 44, 46 and/or the jaws 36, 38 toward each other. As such, the lever 34 actuates the first and second jaws 36, 38 through the inner tubular member 56. [0032] The first jaw 36 is disposed adjacent to the second jaw 38, and they are movable between an open position and a closed position, as described above or in any suitable manner. The first jaw 36 comprises a first electrode 60, and the second jaw 38 comprises a second electrode 62. The electrodes 60, 62 are configured to deliver an energy, or apply a current, to a tissue when energized. The first and second electrodes 60, 62 may be active bipolar electrodes that are configured to be coupled with and energized by an electrode energy source. In the illustrated example, the current may be provided through the leads 48, 50 to the leads 44, 46, and ultimately to the first and second electrodes 60, 62. [0033] The first jaw 36 has a first electrode active surface 64, and the second jaw 38 has a second electrode active surface 66. The first electrode active surface 64 is disposed adjacent to the second electrode active surface 66. In the closed position, the first electrode active surface 64 is disposed adjacent to and contacting a first side of a tissue, and the second electrode active surface 66 is disposed adjacent to and contacting a second side of a tissue, the first and second jaws 36, 38 grasping the tissue. Accordingly, when a tissue is grasped between the active surfaces 64, 66, a current may be applied to the tissue through the active surfaces 64, 66. [0034] A first insulating shield 68 is disposed on the first jaw 36, partially covering the first electrode 60. The first insulating shield 68 covers a portion of the side surfaces (one side designated at 72), the end surface 74, and the outside surface 76 of the first electrode 60. In addition, the first insulating shield 68 covers a portion of the active surface 64; more particularly, a distal portion 78 of the active surface 64 is insulated by the first insulating shield 68. In this example, the active surface 64 has a plurality of teeth 80 disposed thereon. [0035] A second insulating shield 70 is disposed on the second jaw 38, partially covering the second electrode 62. The second insulating shield 70 covers a portion of the side surfaces (one side designated at 82), the end surface 84, and the outside surface 86 of the second electrode 62. In addition, the second insulating shield 70 covers a portion of the active surface 66; more particularly, a distal portion 88 of the active surface 66 is insulated by the second insulating shield 70. In this example, the active surface 66 has a plurality of teeth 90 disposed thereon. [0036] The first and second insulating shields 68, 70 are formed of an insulating material, such as rubber. In some variations, the first and second insulating shields 68, 70 could comprise, for example, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), Ethylene ChloroTriFluoroEthylene (ECTFE), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), polyimide, polyethylene plastic (PEP), and/or nylon. [0037] Though first and second insulating shields 68, 70 are illustrated, it should be understood that, in some variations, only one of the insulating shields 68, 70 is present. [0038] Referring now to FIGS. 2A-2C, another variation of an electrosurgical forceps is illustrated and generally designated at 120. Like the forceps 20 described above, the forceps 120 are of the electrosurgical type that may be used as a bipolar device, for example, to apply pulsed or non- pulsed energy to coagulate a tissue. All details not described with respect to FIGS. 2A-2C may be similar or the same as the features described with respect to the example in FIG. 1 or one of the other examples given herein. For example, the handle and actuation assembly are not illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2C, but it should be understood that the forceps 120 could be actuated in any suitable manner, such as described with respect to FIG. 1. [0039] A first jaw 136 and a second jaw 138 extend from an outer member 122. A first conductive lead 144 is connected to the first forceps jaw 136, and a second conductive lead 1 6 is connected to the second forceps jaw 138. The leads 144, 146 are configured to be connected to a source of RF power (not shown). [0040] The first jaw 136 is disposed adjacent to the second jaw 138, and they are movable between an open position and a closed position, as described above or in any suitable manner. In both FIGS. 2A and 2B, the jaws 136, 138 are illustrated in the open position. In FIG. 2C, the jaws 136, 138 are illustrated in the closed position. The first jaw 136 comprises a first electrode 160, and the second jaw 138 comprises a second electrode 162 (hidden behind second insulating shield 170 in FIG. 2A). The electrodes 160, 162 are configured to deliver an energy, or apply a current, to a tissue when energized. The first and second electrodes 160, 162 may be active bipolar electrodes that are configured to be coupled with and energized by an electrode energy source. In the illustrated example, the current may be provided through the leads 144, 146, and ultimately to the first and second electrodes 160, 162. [0041] The first jaw 36 has a first electrode active surface 164, and the second jaw 138 has a second electrode active surface 166. The first electrode active surface 164 is disposed adjacent to the second electrode active surface 166. In the closed position, the first electrode active surface 164 is disposed adjacent to and contacting a first side of a tissue, and the second electrode active surface 166 is disposed adjacent to and contacting a second side of a tissue, the first and second jaws 136, 138 grasping the tissue. Accordingly, when a tissue is grasped between the active surfaces 164, 166, a current may be applied to the tissue through the active surfaces 164, 166. [0042] A first insulating shield 168 is disposed around the first jaw 136, partially covering the first electrode 160. The first active surface 164 has at least a portion that is substantially free from contact with the first insulating shield 168, which is the portion that is open and facing the second active surface 166. Thus, a portion of the active surface 164 remains uncovered by the first insulating shield 168. The first insulating shield 168 forms a lip 192 extending from the first jaw 136. Referring to FIG. 2C, the lip 192 is disposed a first distance d1 from the second active surface 166 in the closed position. The first active surface 164 is disposed a second distance d2 from the second active surface 166 in the closed position. The first distance d1 is smaller or less than the second distance d2. Thus, the first active surface 164 is recessed with respect to an outer edge 194 of the lip 192. [0043] The first insulating shield 168 also covers side surfaces 196, 197, the end surface (hidden behind an end 198 of the first insulating shield in FIG. 2A), and the outside surface 199 of the first electrode 160. The outside surface 199 is disposed on an opposite side of the first jaw 136 from the first active surface 164. Each side surface 196, 97 connects the first active surface 164 to the outside surface 199. The end surface (under shield end 198) connects each of the side surfaces 196, 197 to each other. The first insulating shield 168 substantially covers the outside surface 199 and each of the side surfaces 196, 197 and the end surface. In addition, in this example, the first insulating shield 168 covers portions 200 of the active surface 164, which are disposed under the lip 192. In this example, the active surface 164 is flat with no teeth disposed thereon; however, it should be understand that any other suitable surface could be used. [0044] A second insulating shield 170 is disposed around the second jaw 138, partially covering the second electrode 162. The second active surface 166 has at least a portion that is substantially free from contact with the second insulating shield 170, which is the portion that is open and facing the first active surface 164. Thus, a portion of the active surface 166 remains uncovered by the second insulating shield 170. The second insulating shield 170 forms a lip 191 extending from the second jaw 138. Referring to FIG. 2C, the lip 191 is disposed a third distance d3 from the first active surface 164 in the closed position. In some examples, the magnitude of d3 may be equal to the magnitude of d1. As stated above, the second active surface 166 is disposed a distance d2 from the first active surface 164 in the closed position. The third distance d3 is smaller or less than the second distance d2. Thus, the second active surface 166 is recessed with respect to an outer edge 193 of the lip 191. [0045] The second insulating shield 170 also covers side surfaces 195, 201 , the end surface (hidden behind an end 202 of the first insulating shield in FIG. 2A), and the outside surface 203 of the second electrode 162. The outside surface 203 is disposed on an opposite side of the second jaw 138 from the second active surface 166. Each side surface 195, 201 connects the second active surface 166 to the outside surface 203. The end surface (under shield end 202) connects each of the side surfaces 195, 201 to each other. The second insulating shield 170 substantially covers the outside surface 203 and each of the side surfaces 195, 201 and the end surface. In addition, in this example, the second insulating shield 170 covers portions 204 of the active surface 166, which are disposed under the lip 191. In this example, the active surface 166 is flat with no teeth disposed thereon; however, it should be understand that any other suitable surface could be used. [0046] The first and second insulating shields 168, 170 are formed of an insulating material, such as rubber. In some variations, the first and second insulating shields 168, 70 could comprise, for example, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), expanded polytetraf!uoroethylene (ePTFE), Ethylene ChloroTriFluoroEthylene (ECTFE), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), polyimide, polyethylene plastic (PEP), and/or nylon. [0047] Though first and second insulating shields 168, 170 are illustrated, it should be understood that, in some variations, only one of the insulating shields 168, 170 is present. [0048] Referring now to FIG. 3, another variation of an electrosurgical forceps is illustrated and generally designated at 220 in a cross-sectional view. Like the forceps 20, 120 described above, the forceps 220 are of the electrosurgical type that may be used as a bipolar device, for example, to apply pulsed or non-pulsed energy to coagulate a tissue. All details not described with respect to FIG. 3 may be similar or the same as the features described with respect to the example in FIG. 1 or one of the other examples given herein. For example, the handle and actuation assembly are not illustrated in FIG. 3, but it should be understood that the forceps 220 could be actuated in any suitable manner, such as described with respect to FIG. 1. [0049] A jaw arrangement 230 is disposed at a distal end of the forceps 220. The jaw arrangement 230 includes a first jaw 236 disposed adjacent to a second jaw 238. Conductive leads (not shown) are configured connect to the first and second jaws 236, 238 to a source of RF power (not shown). [0050] The first and second jaws 236, 238 are movable between an open position and a closed position, as described above or in any suitable manner. In FIG. 3, the jaws 236, 238 are illustrated in the open position. The first jaw 236 comprises a first electrode 260, and the second jaw 238 comprises a second electrode 262. The electrodes 260, 262 are configured to deliver an energy, or apply a current, to a tissue when energized. The first and second electrodes 260, 262 may be active bipolar electrodes that are configured to be coupled with and energized by an electrode energy source. Current may be provided through the first and second electrodes 260, 262 to a tissue that is grasped therebetween, by way of example. [0051] The first jaw 236 has a first electrode active surface 264, and the second jaw 238 has a second electrode active surface 266. The first electrode active surface 264 is disposed adjacent to the second electrode active surface 266. In the closed position, the first electrode active surface 264 is disposed adjacent to and contacting a first side of a tissue, and the second electrode active surface 266 is disposed adjacent to and contacting a second side of a tissue, the first and second jaws 236, 238 grasping the tissue. Accordingly, when a tissue is grasped between the active surfaces 264, 266, a current may be applied to the tissue through the active surfaces 264, 266. [0052] A first insulating shield 268 is disposed around the first jaw 236, partially covering the first electrode 260. The first active surface 264 has at least a portion that is substantially free from contact with the first insulating shield 268, which is the portion that is open and facing the second active surface 266. Thus, a portion of the active surface 264 remains uncovered by the first insulating shield 268. [0053] The first insulating shield 268 may also cover side surfaces 296, 297, the end surface (not visible in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 3), and the outside surface 299 of the first electrode 260. The first side surface 296 is disposed adjacent to a first side 304 of the first active surface 264. The second side surface 297 is disposed adjacent to a second side 305 of the first active surface 264. The first side 304 is an edge of a first angled face 306 of the first active portion 264; in other words, the first side surface 296 is connected to the first angled face 306. The second side 305 is an edge of a second angled face 308 of the first active portion 264; in other words, the second side surface 297 is connected to the second angled face 308. The first insulating shield 268 covers the first and second angled faces 306, 308. The first insulating shield 268 does not cover a main face 307 of the first active surface 264; instead, the main face 307 remains substantially free from contact with the first insulating shield 268. The main face 307 is connected to each of the angled faces 306, 308. The angled faces 306, 308 connect the main face 307 to the side surfaces 296, 297. [0054] The outside surface 299 is disposed on an opposite side of the first jaw 236 from the first active surface 264. Each side surface 296, 297 connects the first active surface 264 to the outside surface 299. The end surface (not shown) connects each of the side surfaces 296, 297 to each other. The first insulating shield 268 substantially covers the outside surface 299 and each of the side surfaces 296, 297 and the end surface. In this example, the active surface 264 is flat with no teeth disposed thereon; however, it should be understand that any other suitable surface could be used. [0055] A second insulating shield 270 is disposed around the second jaw 238, partially covering the second electrode 262. The second active surface 266 has at least a portion that is substantially free from contact with the second insulating shield 270, which is the portion that is open and facing the first active surface 264. Thus, a portion of the second active surface 266 remains uncovered by the second insulating shield 270. [0056] The second insulating shield 270 may also cover side surfaces 295, 301 , the end surface (not visible in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 3), and the outside surface 303 of the second electrode 262. The first side surface 295 is disposed adjacent to a first side 309 of the second active surface 266. The second side surface 301 is disposed adjacent to a second side 310 of the second active surface 266. The first side 309 is an edge of a first angled face 311 of the second active portion 266; in other words, the first side surface 295 is connected to the first angled face 311. The second side 310 is an edge of a second angled face 312 of the second active portion 266; in other words, the second side surface 301 is connected to the second angled face 312. The second insulating shield 270 covers the first and second angled faces 311 , 312. The second insulating shield 270 does not cover a main face 313 of the second active surface 266; instead, the main face 313 remains substantially free from contact with the second insulating shield 270. The main face 313 is connected to each of the angled faces 31 1 , 312. The angled faces 311 , 312 connect the main face 313 to the side surfaces 295, 30 . [0057] The outside surface 303 is disposed on an opposite side of the second jaw 238 from the second active surface 266. Each side surface 295, 301 connects the second active surface 266 to the outside surface 303. The end surface (not shown) connects each of the side surfaces 295, 301 to each other. The second insulating shield 270 substantially covers the outside surface 303 and each of the side surfaces 295, 301 and the end surface. In this example, the second active surface 266 is flat with no teeth disposed thereon; however, it should be understand that any other suitable surface could be used. [0058] The first and second insulating shields 268, 270 are formed of an insulating material, such as rubber. In some variations, the first and second insulating shields 268, 270 could comprise, for example, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), Ethylene ChloroTriFluoroEthylene (ECTFE), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), polyimide, polyethylene plastic (PEP), and/or nylon. [0059] Though first and second insulating shields 268, 270 are illustrated, it should be understood that, in some variations, only one of the insulating shields 268, 270 is present. In this variation, no lip is illustrated in either of the shield portions 268, 270; however a lip could be incorporated if desired. Here, the first and second main faces 307, 313 are flush with their respective shields 268, 270 such that the main faces 307, 313 would touch in the closed position if no tissue were disposed therebetween. [0060] Referring now to FIGS. 4A-4D, another variation of an electrosurgical forceps is illustrated and generally designated at 320. Like the forceps 20, 120, 220 described above, the forceps 320 are of the electrosurgical type that may be used as a bipolar device, for example, to apply pulsed or non-pulsed energy to coagulate a tissue. All details not described with respect to FIGS. 4A-4D may be similar or the same as the features described with respect to the example in FIG. 1 or one of the other examples given herein. For example, the handle and actuation assembly are not illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4D, but it should be understood that the forceps 320 could be actuated in any suitable manner, such as described with respect to FIG. 1. [0061] A first jaw 336 and a second jaw 338 extend from an outer member 322. The first jaw 336 is disposed adjacent to the second jaw 338. Conductive leads (not shown) are configured connect the first and second jaws 336, 338 to a source of RF power (not shown). In the illustrated example, the first and second jaws 336, 338 are pivotally connected by a pivot pin 337, which may be insulated to prevent electrical shortage; however, the jaws 336, 338 may be coupled in any suitable way, such as that described with respect to FIG. 1. [0062] The first and second jaws 336, 338 are movable between an open position and a closed position, as described above or in any suitable manner. In FIG. 4A, the jaws 336, 338 are illustrated in the open position. In FIGS. 4B-4D, the jaws 336, 338 are illustrated in the closed position. [0063] The first jaw 336 comprises a first electrode 360, and the second jaw 338 comprises a second electrode 362. The electrodes 360, 362 are configured to deliver an energy, or apply a current, to a tissue when energized. The first and second electrodes 360, 362 may be active bipolar electrodes that are configured to be coupled with and energized by an electrode energy source. In the illustrated example, the current may be provided through the first and second electrodes 360, 362. [0064] The first jaw 336 has a first electrode active surface 364, and the second jaw 338 has a second electrode active surface 366. The first electrode active surface 364 is disposed adjacent to the second electrode active surface 366. In the closed position, the first electrode active surface 364 is disposed adjacent to and contacting a first side of a tissue, and the second electrode active surface 366 is disposed adjacent to and contacting a second side of a tissue, the first and second jaws 336, 338 grasping the tissue. Accordingly, when a tissue is grasped between the active surfaces 364, 366, a current may be applied to the tissue through the active surfaces 364, 366. [0065] An insulating ring 368 is disposed around first jaw 336. The first jaw 336 has two side surfaces 396, 397 that connect the active surface 364 to an outside surface 399. The insulating ring 368 extends around the first active surface 364, the outside surface 399, and each of the side surfaces 396, 397. The insulating ring 368 is annular having open ends 369, 371 , and the ring 368 is connected all the way around the active surface 364, each side surface 396, 397, and the outside surface 399. The insulating ring 368 may have a width w in the range of about 0.010 inch to about 0.040 inch and a thickness t in the range of about 0.005 inch to about 0.015 inch, by way of example. [0066] The insulating ring 368 prevents re-grasp and/or electrical shortage between the active surfaces 364, 366. More particularly, even when the electrode jaws 336, 338 are closed as illustrated in FIGS. 4B-4D, the active surfaces 364, 366 remain free from contact with each other. In the closed position, the insulating ring 368 contacts the second active surface 366 and acts as a stop to prevent the first active surface 364 from contacting the second active surface 366. For example, referring to FIG. 4D, the jaws 336, 338 are in the closed position, and the first and second active surfaces 364, 366 remain free from contact with each other. [0067] In this example, each of the active surfaces 364, 366 has a plurality of teeth 380, 382 disposed thereon; however, it should be understood that a flat configuration or any other desirable configuration could be used. Although only the first electrode 368 is illustrated having an insulating ring 368 disposed therearound, it should be understood that the second electrode 362 could have its own insulating ring, or either electrode 360, 362 could have multiple insulating rings, if desired. [0068] The insulating ring 368 is formed of an insulating material, such as rubber. In some variations, the insulating ring 368 could comprise, for example, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), Ethylene ChloroTriFluoroEthylene (ECTFE), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), polyimide, polyethylene plastic (PEP), and/or nylon. [0069] Referring now to FIG. 5, another variation of an electrosurgical forceps is illustrated and generally designated at 420 in a cross-sectional view. Like the forceps 20, 120, 220, 320 described above, the forceps 420 are of the electrosurgical type that may be used as a bipolar device, for example, to apply pulsed or non-pulsed energy to coagulate a tissue. All details not described with respect to FIG. 5 may be similar or the same as the features described with respect to the example in FIG. 1 or one of the other examples given herein. For example, the handle and actuation assembly are not illustrated in FIG. 5, but it should be understood that the forceps 420 could be actuated in any suitable manner, such as described with respect to FIG. 1. [0070] A jaw arrangement 430 is disposed at a distal end of the forceps 420. The jaw arrangement 430 includes a first jaw 436 disposed adjacent to a second jaw 438. Conductive leads (not shown) are configured connect to the first and second jaws 436, 438 to a source of RF power (not shown). [0071] The first and second jaws 436, 438 are movable between an open position and a closed position, as described above or in any suitable manner. In FIG. 5, the jaws 436, 438 are illustrated in the open position. The first jaw 436 comprises a first electrode 460, and the second jaw 438 comprises a second electrode 462. The electrodes 460, 462 are configured to deliver an energy, or apply a current, to a tissue when energized. The first and second electrodes 460, 462 may be active bipolar electrodes that are configured to be coupled with and energized by an electrode energy source. Current may be provided through the first and second electrodes 460, 462 to a tissue that is grasped therebetween, by way of example. [0072] The first jaw 436 has a first electrode active surface 464, and the second jaw 438 has a second electrode active surface 466. The first electrode active surface 464 is disposed adjacent to the second electrode active surface 466. In the closed position, the first electrode active surface 464 is disposed adjacent to and contacting a first side of a tissue, and the second electrode active surface 466 is disposed adjacent to and contacting a second side of a tissue, the first and second jaws 436, 438 grasping the tissue. Accordingly, when a tissue is grasped between the active surfaces 464, 466, a current may be applied to the tissue through the active surfaces 464, 466. [0073] The first jaw 436 has an outside surface 499, a first side surface 496, and second side surface 497. The first side surface 496 connects a first side 514 of the outside surface 499 to the first active surface 464. The second side surface 497 connects a second side 515 of the outside surface 499 to the first active surface 464. [0074] The second jaw 438 has an outside surface 503, a first side surface 495, and second side surface 501. The first side surface 495 connects a first side 516 of the outside surface 503 to the second active surface 466. The second side surface 501 connects a second side 517 of the outside surface 503 to the second active surface 466. [0075] A first insulating shield system 468 is disposed on the first jaw 436, partially covering the first electrode 460. More specifically, the first insulating shield system 468 is disposed on the first and second side surfaces 496, 497 of the first electrode 460, wherein the first insulating shield system 468 substantially covers the first and second side surfaces 496, 497. A first shield part 518 substantially or entirely covers the first side surface 496, and a second shield part 519 substantially or entirely covers the second side surface 497. [0076] The first active surface 464 has at least a portion that is substantially free from contact with the first insulating shield system 468; in the illustrated example, the entire active surface 464 is free from contact with the first insulating shield system 468. Thus, at least a portion of the active surface 464 remains uncovered by the first insulating shield system 468. The first outside surface 499 also has at least a portion that is substantially free from contact with the first insulating shield system 468; in the illustrated example, the entire outside surface 499 is free from contact with the first insulating shield system 468. Thus, at least a portion of the outside surface 499 remains uncovered by the first insulating shield system 468. [0077] A second insulating shield system 470 is disposed on the second jaw 438, partially covering the second electrode 462. More specifically, the second insulating shield system 470 is disposed on the first and second side surfaces 495, 501 of the second electrode 462, wherein the second insulating shield system 470 substantially covers the first and second side surfaces 495, 501. A third shield part 521 substantially or entirely covers the first side surface 495, and a fourth shield part 523 substantially or entirely covers the second side surface 501. [0078] The second active surface 466 has at least a portion that is substantially free from contact with the second insulating shield system 470; in the illustrated example, the entire active surface 466 is free from contact with the second insulating shield system 470. Thus, at least a portion of the active surface 466 remains uncovered by the second insulating shield system 470. The second outside surface 503 also has at least a portion that is substantially free from contact with the second insulating shield system 470; in the illustrated example, the entire outside surface 503 is free from contact with the second insulating shield system 470. Thus, at least a portion of the outside surface 503 remains uncovered by the second insulating shield system 470. [0079] The first and second insulating shield systems 468, 470 are formed of an insulating material, such as rubber. In some variations, the first and second insulating shield systems 468, 470 could comprise, for example, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), Ethylene ChloroTriFluoroEthylene (ECTFE), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), polyimide, polyethylene plastic (PEP), and/or nylon. [0080] Though first and second insulating shield systems 468, 470 are illustrated, it should be understood that, in some variations, only one of the insulating shield systems 468, 470 is present. Further, any number of the shield parts 518, 519, 521 , 523 could be omitted. In this variation, no lip (as in FIGS. 2A-2C) is illustrated on either of the shield systems 468, 470; however a lip could be incorporated if desired. Here, the first and second active surfaces 464, 466 are flush with their respective shield systems 468, 470 such that the active surfaces 464, 466 would touch in the closed position if no tissue were disposed therebetween. [0081] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, variations in the various figures can be combined with each without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. [0082] The preferred embodiment of the present invention has been disclosed.
