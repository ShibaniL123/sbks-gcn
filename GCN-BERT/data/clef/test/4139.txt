2-(azetidin-1-yl)nicotinaldehyde
Into a 40 mL vial was added azetidine hydrochloride (0.412 g, 4.40 mmol), 2-chloronicotinaldehyde (0.53 g, 3.67 mmol), K2CO3 (1.268 g, 9.17 mmol) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (7.34 mL). The mixture was stirred at 110Â° C. for 20 hours. Saturated ammonium chloride was added, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, concentrated and purified by flash column chromatography (0 to 30% ethyl acetate in heptane) to provide 2-(azetidin-1-yl)nicotinaldehyde (0.52 g, 3.21 mmol, 87% yield).
