TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a rubber composition and a pneumatic tire formed from the rubber composition. BACKGROUND ART The demands on automobiles for better fuel economy have been increasing in recent years as concern with environmental issues has been rising. Hence, better fuel economy is also required of rubber compositions used for automotive tires. For example, rubber compositions containing a conjugated diene polymer (e.g. polybutadiene, butadiene-styrene copolymer) and filler (e.g. carbon black, silica) are used as the rubber compositions for automotive tires. Patent Literature 1, for example, proposes a method for improving fuel economy. The method uses a diene rubber that has been modified by an organosilicon compound containing an amino group and an alkoxy group. In recent years, however, further improvement in fuel economy has been demanded. Moreover, since some other properties required of the rubber compositions for automotive tires, such as wet-grip performance and abrasion resistance, generally have trade-off relationships with fuel economy, it has been difficult to achieve these properties at high levels in good balance. In US 2010/0056710 A1 a rubber composition is disclosed, which comprises silica and a conjugated diene polymer that comprises a constitutional unit with a silyl group. A similar rubber composition is known from US 2010/0056711 A1. US 2010/048806 A1 relates to a process for producing a modified polymer rubber comprising the modification of the end groups of the polymer with an isocyanurate compound. US 2010/0105826 A1 relates a rubber composition, which includes silica and a modified butadiene rubber.

Wet-grip performance tends to decrease when the NR content is more than 70% by mass. There are no particular limitations on the BR, and those commonly used in the tire industry may be used, such as high-cis BR such as BR1220 from Zeon Corporation and BR130B and BR150B from Ube Industries, Ltd., and BR containing syndiotactic polybutadiene crystals, such as VCR412 and VCR617 from Ube Industries, Ltd. The BR content based on 100% by mass of the rubber component is preferably not less than 5% by mass, more preferably not less than 10% by mass, and still more preferably not less than 15% by mass. Abrasion resistance tends to decrease when the BR content is less than 5% by mass. The BR content is preferably not more than 60% by mass, and more preferably not more than 50% by mass. Wet-grip performance tends to decrease when the BR content exceeds 60% by mass. The total content of NR and BR, based on 100% by mass of the rubber component, is preferably not less than 10% by mass, more preferably not less than 20% by mass, and still more preferably not less than 30% by mass. Abrasion resistance tends to decrease when the total content is less than 10% by mass. The total content is preferably not more than 70% by mass, and more preferably not more than 50% by mass. Wet-grip performance tends to decrease when the total content exceeds 70% by mass. The rubber composition of the present invention is characterized by containing silica as a reinforcing agent. The amount (content) of silica per 100 parts by mass of the rubber component is preferably 5 to 150 parts by mass, and more preferably 10 to 100 parts by mass. Abrasion resistance tends to be insufficient when the amount of silica is less than 5 parts by mass. Also, processability tends to deteriorate when the amount of silica exceeds 150 parts by mass. One kind of silica may be used alone, or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. The silica preferably has a nitrogen adsorption specific surface area (N2SA) of 40 to 400 m2/g, and more preferably of 60 to 360 m2/g. If the silica has a nitrogen adsorption specific surface area of less than 40 m2/g, little reinforcing effect tends to be obtained and abrasion resistance tends to be reduced. If the silica has a nitrogen adsorption specific surface area of more than 400 m2/g, its dispersibility tends to be poor and the hysteresis loss tends to increase, leading to reduced fuel economy. The nitrogen adsorption specific surface area of silica is a value measured by the BET method in accordance with ASTM D3037-81. The silica content based on 100% by mass of the total of silica and carbon black is preferably not less than 60% by mass, and more preferably not less than 85% by mass. The silica content is preferably not more than 98% by mass, and more preferably not more than 95% by mass. When the silica content is in the ranges, fuel economy, wet-grip performance, and abrasion resistance can be improved at high levels in good balance. A silane coupling agent may be used together when the silica is added. Examples of the silane coupling agent include: bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide, bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)trisulfide, bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)disulfide, bis(2-triethoxysilylethyl)tetrasulfide, bis(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide, bis(2-trimethoxysilylethyl)tetrasulfide, 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane, 2-mercaptoethyltrimethoxysilane, 2-mercaptoethyltriethoxysilane, 3-trimethoxysilylpropyl-N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl-tetrasulfide, 3-triethoxysilylpropyl-N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl-tetrasulfide, 2-triethoxysilylethyl-N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl-tetrasulfide, 3-trimethoxysilylpropylbenzothiazole tetrasulfide, 3-triethoxysilylpropylbenzothiazolyltetrasulfide, 3-triethoxysilylpropyl methacrylate monosulfide, 3-trimethoxysilylpropyl methacrylate monosulfide, bis(3-diethoxymethylsilylpropyl)tetrasulfide, 3-mercaptopropyldimethoxymethylsilane, dimethoxymethylsilylpropyl-N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl-tetrasulfide, and dimethoxymethylsilylpropylbenzothiazole tetrasulfide. Among these examples, bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-tetrasulfide and 3-trimethoxysilylpropylbenzothiazolyl-tetrasulfide are preferred in terms of the reinforcement-improving effect. One of these silane coupling agents may be used alone, or two or more thereof may be used in combination. The amount of the silane coupling agent per 100 parts by mass of the silica is preferably not less than 1 part by mass, and more preferably not less than 2 parts by mass. If the silane coupling agent is incorporated in an amount of less than 1 part by mass, the resulting unvulcanized rubber composition tends to have a high viscosity and its processability tends to deteriorate. The amount of the silane coupling agent per 100 parts by mass of the silica is preferably not more than 20 parts by mass, and more preferably not more than 15 parts by mass. If the silane coupling agent is incorporated in an amount of more than 20 parts by mass, an effect of the silane coupling agent commensurate with its amount tends not to be obtained and the cost tends to increase. Known additives can be used and examples thereof include vulcanizing agents such as sulfur; vulcanization accelerators such as thiazole vulcanization accelerators, thiuram vulcanization accelerators, sulfenamide vulcanization accelerators, and guanidine vulcanization accelerators; vulcanization activators such as stearic acid and zinc oxide; organoperoxides; fillers such as carbon black, calcium carbonate, talc, alumina, clay, aluminum hydroxide, and mica; silane coupling agents; processing aids such as extender oil and lubricants; and antioxidants. Examples of the carbon black include furnace blacks (furnace carbon blacks) such as SAF, ISAF, HAF, MAF, FEF, SRF, GPF, APF, FF, CF, SCF, and ECF; acetylene blacks (acetylene carbon blacks); thermal blacks (thermal carbon blacks) such as FT and MT; channel blacks (channel carbon blacks) such as EPC, MPC, and CC; and graphite. One of these may be used alone, or two or more thereof may be used in combination. From the viewpoint that fuel economy, wet-grip performance, and abrasion resistance can be improved at high levels in good balance, the carbon black content per 100 parts by mass of the rubber component is preferably not less than 1 part by mass, and more preferably not less than 3 parts by mass. The carbon black content is preferably not more than 30 parts by mass, and more preferably not more than 10 parts by mass. The carbon black typically has a nitrogen adsorption specific surface area (N2SA) of 5 to 200 m2/g, and the lower limit thereof is preferably 50 m2/g, while the upper limit thereof is preferably 150 m2/g. The carbon black typically has a dibutyl phthalate (DBP) absorption of 5 to 300 mL/100 g, and the lower limit thereof is preferably 80 mL/100 g, while the upper limit thereof is preferably 180 mL/100 g. If the carbon black has an N2SA or DBP absorption less than the lower limit of the range, little reinforcing effect tends to be obtained and abrasion resistance tends to be reduced. In the case of exceeding the upper limit of the range, the carbon black tends to have poor dispersibility and the hysteresis loss tends to increase, leading to reduced fuel economy. The nitrogen adsorption specific surface area is measured according to ASTM D4820-93, and the DBP absorption is measured according to ASTM D2414-93. Applicable commercial products include those available from Tokai Carbon Co., Ltd. under the trade names SEAST 6, SEAST 7HM, and SEAST KH, those from Degussa under the trade names CK3 and Special Black 4A, and the like.

The polycyclic aromatic content of the extender oil is preferably less than 3% by mass, and more preferably less than 1% by mass. The polycyclic aromatic content is measured according to British Institute of Petroleum method 346/92. In addition, the aromatics content (CA) of the extender oil is preferably not less than 20% by mass. Two or more of these extender oils may be used in combination. Examples of the vulcanization accelerators include thiazole vulcanization accelerators such as 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, dibenzothiazyl disulfide, and N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazylsulfenamide; thiuram vulcanization accelerators such as tetramethylthiuram monosulfide and tetramethylthiuram disulfide; sulfenamide vulcanization accelerators such as N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide, N-t-butyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide, N-oxyethylene-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide, and N,N'-diisopropyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide; and guanidine vulcanization accelerators such as diphenylguanidine, di-ortho-tolylguanidine, and ortho-tolylbiguanidine. The amount to be used per 100 parts by mass of the rubber component is preferably 0.1 to 5 parts by mass, and more preferably 0.2 to 3 parts by mass. Known methods can be used in order to add other rubbers, additives, and the like, to the conjugated diene polymer to prepare the rubber composition. For example, a method may be employed in which ingredients are mixed using a known mixer, e.g., a roll or Banbury mixer. With regard to the mixing conditions when additives other than vulcanizing agents and vulcanization accelerators are added, the mixing temperature is typically 50°C to 200°C, preferably 80°C to 190°C, and the mixing time is typically 30 seconds to 30 minutes, preferably 1 to 30 minutes. When a vulcanizing agent and vulcanization accelerator are added, the mixing temperature is typically not higher than 100°C, and preferably from room temperature to 80°C. The composition in which the vulcanizing agent and vulcanization accelerator have been incorporated is typically subjected to a vulcanizing treatment such as press vulcanization before use. The vulcanization temperature is typically 120°C to 200°C, and preferably 140°C to 180°C. The rubber composition of the present invention exhibits an excellent balance among fuel economy, wet-grip performance, and abrasion resistance and achieves significant improvement in these properties. The rubber composition of the present invention can be suitably used for various tire components and is particularly well suited for treads. The pneumatic tire of the present invention can be formed from the rubber composition by a usual method. Specifically, an unvulcanized rubber composition, in which various additives have been incorporated as necessary, is extrusion-processed into the shape of a tire tread and is then arranged by a usual method in a tire building machine and assembled with other tire components to form an unvulcanized tire. This unvulcanized tire is subjected to heat and pressure in a vulcanizer to form a pneumatic tire according to the present invention. The pneumatic tire of the present invention can be suitably used as tires for passenger automobiles and tires for trucks/buses (heavy duty tires). EXAMPLES The present invention is described in detail by the following examples. The property evaluations were carried out using the following methods. In the following evaluations, Comparative Example 1 was used as a reference for comparison with Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative Examples 2 to 4, and Comparative Example 5 was used as a reference for comparison with Example 7. 1. Vinyl bond content (unit: mol%) The vinyl bond content of a polymer was determined by infrared spectroscopic analysis, from the intensity of absorption band around 910 cm-1 which is an absorption peak for a vinyl group. 2. Styrene unit content (unit: % by mass) According to JIS K6383 (1995), the styrene unit content of a polymer was determined from the refractive index. 3. Molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and the number-average molecular weight (Mn) were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) under the conditions (1) to (8) described below. The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of a polymer was then determined from the measured Mw and Mn. (1) Instrument: HLC-8020 from Tosoh Corporation(2) Separation columns: 2 x GMH-XL in tandem, from Tosoh Corporation(3) Measurement temperature: 40°C(4) Carrier: Tetrahydrofuran(5) Flow rate: 0.6 mL/minute(6) Injection amount: 5 µL(7) Detector: Differential refractometer(8) Molecular weight standards: Polystyrene standards 4. tanδ A test specimen strip (width 1 mm or 2 mm x length 40 mm) was punched from a sheet of the vulcanized rubber composition and subjected to testing. Using a spectrometer from Ueshima Seisakusho Co., Ltd., the tanδ was measured at a dynamic strain amplitude of 1%, a frequency of 10 Hz, and a temperature of 50°C. The value of the reciprocal of tanδ was expressed as an index relative to the value of the reference for comparison (=100). A larger numerical value indicates lower rolling resistance and therefore better fuel economy. 5. Rolling resistance The rolling resistance was measured using a rolling resistance tester by running a test tire on a rim of 15 x 6JJ with an internal air pressure of 230 kPa, under a load of 3.43 kN at a speed of 80 km/h. The resulting value was expressed as an index relative to the value of the reference for comparison (=100). A larger index value is better (better fuel economy). 6. Wet-grip performance Test tires were mounted on all the wheels of a vehicle (domestic, FF, 2000 cc) and the braking distance was determined with an initial speed of 100 km/h on a wet asphalt road surface. The resulting value was expressed as an index, with larger numbers indicating better wet-skid performance (wet-grip performance). Indexing was performed using the following formula. Wet-skid performance=Braking distance of the reference for comparison/Braking distance of the particular example or comparative example×100 7. Abrasion test using LAT The volume loss of each vulcanized rubber composition was measured using a LAT tester (Laboratory Abrasion and Skid Tester) under the conditions of: load 50N, speed 20 km/h, and slip angle 5°. The numerical values (LAT indices) shown in Tables 2 and 3 are values relative to the volume loss of the reference for comparison (=100). The larger the value, the better the abrasion resistance.

Vulcanization accelerator 2: Soxinol D from Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. (Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 5) According to each formulation shown in Table 2 or 3, materials other than the sulfur and vulcanization accelerators were mixed for 5 minutes at 150°C using a 1.7-L Banbury mixer from Kobe Steel, Ltd., to obtain a kneaded mixture. The sulfur and vulcanization accelerators were then added to the kneaded mixture, and they were mixed using an open roll mill for 5 minutes at 80°C to obtain an unvulcanized rubber composition. The unvulcanized rubber composition was press-vulcanized for 20 minutes at 170°C in a 0.5 mm-thick mold to obtain a vulcanized rubber composition. In addition, the unvulcanized rubber composition was formed into a tread shape, and assembled with other tire components in a tire building machine to form an unvulcanized tire.
