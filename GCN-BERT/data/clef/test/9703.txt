Example 7-6 : Preparation of 2-bromo-3-methoxy-6-(2-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)pyridine (XXXXIX)
1-(6-Bromo-5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)ethanone (XXXXVIII) (3.22 g, 14.00 mmol) was dissolved in 30 ml of benzene. To the resulting solution were added 3.9 ml of ethylene glycol and p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) (799 mg, 4.20 mmol) and the solution was stirred with reflux for 40 hrs. After the reaction was completed, the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure and extracted with 60 ml of water and 60 ml of ethylacetate. The organic layer was treated with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), and filtered, and the solution was concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (normal hexane : ethylacetate = 10 : 1, v/v) to give the title compound as a white solid (2.18 g, 7.95 mmol, 57 %).
