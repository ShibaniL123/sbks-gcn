Example 5-3 : Preparation of 2'-(2-amino-pyridin-4-yl)-5'-methoxy-[4,4']bipyrimidinyl-2-ylamine (XXXIII)
1-[2-(2-Amino-pyridin-4-yl)-5-methoxy-pyrimidin-4-yl]-ethanone (XXXI) (200 mg, 1.404 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) (1.7 ml, 14.03 mmol) and the resulting solution was stirred with reflux for 24 hrs. The solution was cooled and evaporated and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a yellow solid. The solid was dissolved in methanol (MeOH) (1 mL), and to the resulting solution were added dropwise 25 % sodium methoxide (NaOMe) (186 ÂµL, 6.212 mmol) and guanidine hydrochloride (498.0 mg, 6.212 mmol). And then, the solution was stirred with reflux for 24 hrs, cooled, diluted with ethylacetate (EA) and washed with water. Then, the organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then evaporated and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the title compound (98.3 mg, 19%).
