FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates to gathering devices, and more particularly to expandable rolling devices for picking up small objects (e.g., screws, nuts and bolts, bullet casings, edible and inedible nuts, or the like). BACKGROUND Picking up small objects has traditionally been a difficult task. It requires an individual to bend over or squat down constantly and there is little guarantee that the unaided eye will locate all of the objects the individual wishes to pick up. In many instances it is important to locate and pick up all small objects in an area. Small hardware such as screws, nuts and bolts on airport runways, aircraft carrier decks, warehouse floors, or other industrial settings pose both an injury risk to individuals and a risk to delicate and expensive hardware such as a jet engine which may pick up such small objects, causing damage to interior mechanisms. Bullet casings are also small and difficult to pick up, however firing ranges must regularly locate and pick up large quantities of bullet casings. It is equally important to locate and pick up all nuts (e.g., acorns, almonds, walnuts, chestnuts, hickory nuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, sweet gum balls and the like) around nut trees or in similar areas. Thoroughness in this use case maximizes returns and profitability. A variety of machines have been developed to pick up such small items. Generally, such machines are large and cumbersome such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,679,133; 3,148,493; 4,364,222; 3,387,442; 3,475,889; 3,530,655; 3,579,969; and 3,591,948. These machines are all large production harvesters that might be used for a farm having hundreds of acres of nut trees. Other devices, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,025,620 and 5,168,692, provide nut harvesters which are manually operable by an individual. While usable by an individual and efficient in small areas, such devices have a defined and limited effective width for picking up small objects, necessitating many passes to pick up all objects in a given area. Furthermore, such devices are limited to only the use they have been designed for (i.e., picking up small items) and are not configured to be readily expandable or adaptable for additional uses. Such devices cannot readily attach to other objects and may tip over when the collection basket is removed. Given the foregoing, what are needed are expandable and adaptable devices for picking up small items. Furthermore, devices are needed which are expandable but remain manually operable by an individual. SUMMARY This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. It is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the subject matter to be claimed, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the subject matter to be claimed. The present disclosure is directed to roller devices which pick up small items such as screws, nuts and bolts, bullet casings, nuts, golf balls, pine cones and the like. Devices in accordance with the present disclosure are expandable to include multiple assemblies for picking up small items. Small items are collected in one or more removable collection baskets, enabling efficient disposal or disposition of picked up items. Gathering devices in accordance with the present disclosure may be manually pushed or pulled or operated by being pushed or pulled by a motor vehicle or other conveyance. In an aspect, a gathering device includes two triangular brackets spaced apart and interconnected by an axle. A handle extends from and is connected to each bracket. A roller assembly is mounted on the axle for gathering small items as the roller assembly rolls across a surface and a stripper mechanism removes small items from roller assembly and causes them to be deposited into a removable collection basket Further features and advantages of the devices and systems disclosed herein, as well as the structure and operation of various aspects of the present disclosure, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying figures.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure is directed to rolling gathering devices which pick up small items such as screws, nuts and bolts, bullet casings, other nuts, golf balls, pine cones and the like. Devices in accordance with the present disclosure have removable collection baskets which enable rapid adapting of the rolling gathering device and efficient emptying of gathered items. Referring now to FIG. 1-2, the manually maneuverable rolling gathering device 100 is depicted, in assembled form which is operable for collecting small items off a surface as gathering device 100 is pushed and rolled thereacross. The surface may be the ground, a floor, or another type of terrain. FIG. 2 shows a collection basket 108 being removed from gathering device 100. Gathering device 100 includes two brackets 106 (labeled as brackets 106a-b in FIGS. 1-2) spaced laterally apart and interconnected by an axle 502 (see FIG. 5), a handle 118 extending upwards at an acute angle from and connected to each bracket 106, a roller assembly 102 is mounted on axle 502 for gathering small items as roller assembly 102 rolls across a surface, a remover mechanism 114 connected to each bracket 106 at cross member 504 is positioned to remove small items from roller assembly 102 and direct same to a collection basket 108 removably positioned adjacent to remover mechanism 102 such that small items removed from roller assembly 102 fall into collection basket 108. Roller assembly 102 comprises a plurality of thin wheel units placed side-by-side contiguously on axle 502 with an end plate 120 on each end supported on axle 502. These wheel units are basically of the type disclosed and more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,168,692. Drum 120 includes a central bore for receiving axle 502. Each wheel unit is able to rotate around axle 502 separately and independently from each other. Each wheel unit 103 includes a plurality of spaced flexible spokes 104 (labelled, for clarity, only as spoke 104a in FIG. 1). Spokes 104 are spaced laterally from one another and pick up small items as rolling assembly 102 rolls over the items by flexibly entraining or squeezing the small item between adjacent spokes 104. In at least the lateral direction, spokes 104 are spaced at least a distance approximately equal to the narrowest dimension of the small item gathering device 100 is designed and configured to pick up. For bullet casings, spokes 104 are laterally spaced from one another a distance approximately equal to the diameter of the bullet casing. For nuts the spacing is approximately equal to the narrowest width of the nut casing, whether the nut casing is oval (pecans), round (walnuts), or another cross section. For golf balls, the spacing is approximately equal to the diameter of a regulation golf ball, namely, 1.68 inches (42.67 mm). As will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein, spacing of spokes 104 need not be precisely adapted for the type or species of small item being gathered because spokes 104 are flexible. It is only necessary that the play between adjacent wheel units, the flexibility of spokes 104, and any other looseness in the structure be sufficient to allow the small items to be jammed between adjacent spokes 104 tightly enough to be restrained there until removed from roller assembly 102 by remover mechanism 114. Spokes 104 may be about 0.1 to about 0.25 inch in diameter and about 1-4 inches in length for most applications. Spokes 104 are slightly flexible so as to accommodate various sizes of small items, but sufficiently stiff to be able to retain a small item between two or more adjacent spokes 104. Remover mechanism 114 is a large comb-like structure with a plurality of independent separate teeth 122 (labeled, for clarity, only as tooth 122a in FIG. 1) connected to a remover cross member 504. In an aspect, teeth 122 are pivotally connected to cross member 504. Each tooth 122 is positioned between adjacent rows of spokes 104 on adjacent wheel units. This positioning causes small items trapped between spokes 104 on adjacent wheels, or between spokes 104 on the same wheel 103, to be forced out from between spokes 104 as roller assembly 102 rotates. The small items then slide across remover mechanism 114 and into collection basket 108. Handle 118 allows an individual to push gathering device 100 across a surface in order to gather the small items. Handle 118 is positioned at a height suitable for manual operation of gathering device 100. Handle 118 may include extensions 116 (labeled as extensions 116a-b in FIG. 1) which connect handle 118 to gathering device 100 at handle receivers 212 of bracket 106. Handle 118 and extensions 116 may be telescopic to provide adjustability of the height of handle 118, the position being set by set screws or may be releasably locked together by a common spring loaded button and a plurality of openings, well known in the art. For each roller assembly 102, gathering device 100 includes a pair of spaced brackets 106. Brackets 106 are interconnected by rigid cross members 502, 504, 210, described herein. In an aspect, cross member 210 also serves as a support and physical stop for collection basket 108 when collection basket 108 is connected to gathering device 100. Bracket 106 is a rigid member having a vertically-oriented slot 202 (labeled as slots 202a-b in FIGS. 2 and 4) positioned adjacent to remover mechanism 114. Slot 202 has an inner wall 204 and an outer wall 206. Slots 202 removably attach a bracket 106 to collection basket 108 by receiving tongue 208 (labeled as tongues 208a-b in FIG. 2). Horizontal rearward and forward movement of tongue 208 within slot 202 is constrained by inner wall 204 and outer wall 206. Horizontal side movement of tongue 208 within slot 202 is constrained by side stop 220 of bracket 106 Collection basket 108 receives small items from roller assembly 102 after they have been removed from roller assembly 102 by remover mechanism 114. Collection basket 108 has at least one opening positioned adjacent to remover mechanism 114 such that small items may fall into collection basket 108. In an aspect, the opening is adjacent and below remover mechanism 114. Collection basket 108 includes two basket sides 110 (labeled as basket sides 110a-b in FIG. 1) interconnected by basket cross members 218 and wall 112. Cross members 218 connect to basket sides 110 at side receivers 602 (labeled as side receivers 602a-b in FIG. 6). Wall 112 may be a solid member, a mesh, or another member having a plurality of openings. Such openings allow water, undesired small objects, and other materials to escape collection basket 108 while retaining the desired small items. Basket side 110 also includes handle 114 (labeled as handle 114a-b in FIG. 1) configured to allow an individual to easily place, remove, unload or otherwise maneuver collection basket 108. Basket side 110 includes downward facing tongue 208 positioned adjacent the collection basket opening. Tongue 208 is positioned near a top portion of basket side 110. Collection basket 108 is held in place solely by contact between slot 202 and tongue 208, other portions of bracket 106 and contact with cross member 210. In another aspect, cross member 210 may be omitted. In yet another aspect, gathering device 100 further may include one or more locking mechanisms, such as a clip or an elastic cord, positioned to removably connect collection basket 108 to gathering device 100. Slot 202 is positioned at an upper front portion of bracket 106, allows for quick removal of collection basket 108. Bracket 106 further includes a side stop 220 extending forward and beyond slot 202. Side stop 220 physically limits the lateral side movement of collection basket 108 when attached to bracket 106. Side stop 220 also facilitates alignment of collection basket 108 when collection basket 108 is attached. In an aspect, side stop 220 is a rigid portion of bracket 106 sloping downward and out from a point adjacent to outer wall 206. Via slot 202 and other portions, bracket 106 enables gathering device 100 to connect to collection baskets 108 of various dimensions. As shown in FIGS. 10 & 11, collection basket 108 may have a narrow profile or a wider profile provided that collection basket 108 includes a pair of spaced tongues 208. In an aspect, helper or basket support spaced wheels, including 1002, are rotatably connected to bracket 106 at receivers 222a,b positioned to provide additional stabilizing contact and enhanced maneuverability and decreased wear of the gathering device 100 with the surface being traversed. Referring now to FIGS. 3 & 4, views of bracket 106 in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure are shown. Bracket 106 is an integral molded and triangular member. Bracket 106 includes a plurality of sockets 304 (labeled as sockets 304a-k in FIG. 3). Sockets 304 are hexagonal receivers including a socket center bore for receiving a nut having a plurality of sides, thereby enabling attachment of one or more additional portions, accessories, and the like which will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein. A bolt may be inserted into a nut positioned within socket directly or the bolt may be inserted into the nut by passing through the socket center bore. Socket 3041 provides an attachment location for, for example, the pulling handle 902 by which the forward end of such handle may be adjusted upwardly in the direction of arrow 903, thus locating the forward connection of handle 902 in one of the sockets 304a-e and possibly in sockets 304g or k, all such sockets being on a radius from socket 304i. Axle 502 connects to bracket 106 at a rear receiver 216. Cross member 210 connects to bracket 106 at a forward receiver 222. Each one of rear receiver 216. upper receiver 214 and forward receiver 222 is a cylindrical recess having a center bore 302 for receiving a bolt or similar member. Center bore 302 may have a small diameter relative to the inner diameter of receiver 214, 216, 222 enabling another portion to be anchored to bracket 106 via the insertion of a bolt or similar member. Center bore 302 may have another diameter, including a diameter equal to the inner diameter of receiver 214, 216, 222 thereby allowing a cross member to pass through center bore 302. As shown in FIG. 4, bracket sides are mirror images. A first side 401 and a second side 403 comprise similar sockets 304, slots 202 and receivers 214, 216, 222 thereby enabling bracket 106 to connect to other portions of gathering device 100 from either side. Thus, gathering device 106 is expandable to include a multiple roller assemblies 102, remover assemblies 114, collection baskets 108 and the like. As shown in FIGS. 7 & 8, gathering device may include three brackets 106, two roller assemblies 102, two remover assemblies 114, and two collection baskets 108. Handle 118 connects the two outer brackets 106 enabling one individual or multiple individuals to push gathering device 100. Gathering devices 100 in accordance with the present disclosure may also be driven by a motor vehicle. When two of the roller assemblies 114 are gauged together, preferably the middle bracket 106 has receivers 214, 216 and 222 drilled out so that the cross members 504, 502 and 210 may be continuous to provide enhanced rigidity and structurally integrity to the gathering device 100. As shown in FIG. 9, gathering device 100 is configurable for operation while being pulled. In an aspect, handle 118 may be removed or omitted and a puller bar 902 attached to gathering device 100 at one or more sockets 302. In such a configuration, gathering device 100 may be pulled behind a motor vehicle. While various aspects of the present disclosure have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example and not limitation. It will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) that various changes in form and detail can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.
