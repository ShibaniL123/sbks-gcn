The present invention relates to a washer, in particular a dishwasher. The present invention particularly relates to a washer which has a cold water intake and a hot water intake. The present invention more particularly relates to a method of controlling a cold /hot water feeding process in a washer. A conventional washer is usually provided only with a cold water intake. However, using cold water without heating may degrade the washing results. Therefore, the water taken into the washing chamber is generally heated up to a predetermined target temperature in accordance with a selected washing program. A conventional washer is commonly provided with an electrical heater for heating the water taken into the washing chamber. However, this heating process results in a prolongation of the total running time of the washer and also in an increase of the overall energy consumption. In general, the temperature of the water taken into the washing chamber strongly varies according to seasonal conditions. Therefore, the total running time and the overall energy consumption may generally increase in the colder times of the year. The aforementioned adverse effects are commonly mitigated by providing a washer with an additional hot water intake. Hence, a user may connect such a washer with cold/hot water intake to the cold water mains and the in-house hot water mains to shorten operation times and reduce energy consumption. DE 40 41 108 A1 discloses a dishwasher which comprises separate connections for hot water and cold water, a heater for heating the water taken into the washer and a switch for selecting different washing programs. A problem with the above conventional washer is that if too much of hot water is taken into the washing chamber the articles corrode more easily under the influence of detergent or the like. On the other hand, if an insufficient amount of hot water is taken into the washing chamber, the subsequent heating process unnecessarily prolongs the total run time of the program and the overall energy consumption increases. An objective of the present invention is to provide a washer and a method for controlling a washer which overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks of the prior art and which enables reliable washing results. This objective has been achieved by the method according to the present invention as defined in claim 1, and the washer according to the present invention as defined in claim 7. Further achievements have been attained by the subject-matters respectively defined in the dependent claims. The washer of the present invention comprises a mixing valve for homogenously mixing the cold water output by a first valve for opening/closing the cold water intake and the hot water output by a second valve for opening/closing the hot water intake, a washing chamber which collects the mixed water output by the mixing valve and a temperature sensor for measuring a temperature T_mix of the mixed water. The temperature sensor is arranged on a downstream side of the mixing valve. In the present invention a control unit of the washer controls the first valve and the second valve based on the temperature T_mix and a target temperature T_target of the mixed water. In an embodiment, the first valve and the second valve are initially both opened, and the cold and the hot water are homogenously mixed. The temperature T_mix of the mixed water is monitored by the temperature sensor and compered with the target temperature T_target. Subsequently in case of a mismatch between T_mix and T_target, either the first valve or the second valve is opened while keeping the other one closed so as to attain the target temperature of the mixed water. In another embodiment, the mixed water is initially collected in an auxiliary chamber prior to discharging the same into the washing chamber to improve the mixing process. In another embodiment, the temperature of the mixed water is measured immediately on an output side of the mixing valve. In an alternative embodiment, the temperature of the mixed water is measured in the auxiliary chamber. In another alternative embodiment, the temperature of the mixed water is measured in the washing chamber. In another embodiment, T_target is determined based on a currently selected washing program. In this embodiment, T_target is a value predetermined for each washing program. In another alternative embodiment, T_target is determined based on a temperature of the cold water and a temperature of the hot water. The present invention can be applied to any kind of washer, in particular a dishwasher, a clothes washer, a clothes washer/dryer or the like. By the present invention a washer has been provided which has an improved energy efficiency class. In the present invention, the cold water and the hot water taken into the washer can be homogenously mixed by virtue of the mixing valve and a temperature of the mixed water can be correctly measured on a downstream side of the mixing valve. Thereby, a target temperature of the mixed water can be exactly attained, a prolongation of the washing programs can be prevented, and the energy consumption can be reduced.
