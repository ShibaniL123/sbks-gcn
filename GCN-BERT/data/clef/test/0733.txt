Nos. 61/142,714, filed January 6, 2009; 61/153,274, filed February 17, 2009; and 61/170,915, filed April 20, 2009, the contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD This disclosure relates to compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions such as antibiotic compositions, and methods of using the same for treating or preventing Staphyloccocus aureus (S. aureus, also referred to as SA herein) infections in humans and other animals. This disclosure also relates to compositions, such as disinfectants, sanitizers, antiseptics, and detergents, and methods of using the same for eradicating or reducing the presence of S. aureus.on surfaces, including inanimate/non-living and biological surfaces (e.g., skin, wounds), and/or for attenuating the infectivity of S. aureus in order to prevent and/or to reduce the spread of A aureus infections. BACKGROUND Staphylococcus aureus, often referred to simply as "staph," is a bacterium commonly carried on the skin or in the nose of healthy people. Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of skin infections in the United States. Most of these skin infections are minor (such as pimples and boils) and can be treated without antibiotics. However, staph bacteria also can cause serious infections, such as surgical wound infections, bloodstream infections, and pneumonia. Staphylococci are Gram-positive spherical bacteria that occur in microscopic clusters resembling grapes. In 1884, Rosenbach described the two pigmented colony types of staphylococci and proposed the appropriate nomenclature: Staphylococcus aureus (yellow) and Staphylococcus albus (white). The latter species is now named Staphylococcus epidermidis. Staphylococci are facultative anaerobes that grow by aerobic respiration or by fermentation that yields principally lactic acid. The bacteria are catalase-positive and oxidase negative. S. aureus can grow at a temperature range of 15 to 45 degrees and at NaCl concentrations as high as 15 percent. Some staph bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) is a type of staph that is resistant to antibiotics called beta-lactams. Beta-lactam antibiotics include methicillin and other more common antibiotics such as oxacillin, penicillin and amoxicillin. The majority of MRSA infections occur among patients in hospitals or other healthcare settings (referred to as hospital-acquired MRSA or HA-MRSA infections); however, Staph and MRSA can also cause illness in persons outside of hospitals and healthcare facilities. MRSA infections that are acquired by persons who have not been recently (within the past year) hospitalized or have had a medical procedure (such as dialysis, surgery, catheters) are known as community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections. About 75 percent of CA-MRSA infections are localized to skin and soft tissue and usually can be treated effectively. However, CA-MRSA strains display enhanced virulence, spread more rapidly and cause more severe illness than traditional HA-MRSA infections, and can affect vital organs leading to widespread infection (sepsis), toxic shock syndrome and pneumonia. It is not known why some healthy people develop CA-MRSA skin infections that are treatable whereas others infected with the same strain develop severe, fatal infections. Studies have shown that rates of CA-MRSA infection are growing. In 1999, four children in Minnesota and North Dakota were reported to have died from fulminant CA-MRSA infections. One study of children in south Texas found that cases of CA-MRSA increased 14-fold between 1999 and 2001. By 2007, CA-MRSA was the most frequent cause of skin and soft tissue infections seen in emergency departments in the United States. Hospital strains of S. aureus are usually resistant to a variety of different antibiotics. A few strains are resistant to all clinically useful antibiotics except vancomycin, and vancomycin-resistant strains (VRSA) are increasingly-reported. Methicillin resistance is widespread (MRSA) and most methicillin-resistant strains are also multiple drug-resistant. In addition, S. aureus exhibits resistance to antiseptics and disinfectants, such as quaternary ammonium compounds, which may aid its survival in the hospital environment. More people in the U.S. now die from MRSA infection than from AIDS. MRSA was responsible for an estimated 94,000 life-threatening infections and 18,650 deaths in 2005, as reported by CDC in the Oct. 17, 2007 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. The national estimate is more than double the invasive MRSA prevalence reported five years earlier. That same year, roughly 16,000 people in the U.S. died from AIDS, according to CDC. SUMMARY This disclosure relates to the prevention and/or treatment of S. aureus infections, including MRSA and VRSA infections, with the use of a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes, such as pancreatic or other digestive-track enzymes (e.g., porcine pancreatic enzymes) or plant-, fungal-, or microorganism-derived enzymes, that break down components of food. As used herein, a pharmaceutical composition can be used for human or veterinary indications. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions can be useful for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of human or other mammalian populations (e.g., pig, horse, cow, sheep, goat, monkey, rat, mouse, cat, dog) or of bird populations (e.g., duck, goose, chicken, turkey). The pharmaceutical compositions can be used on their own, and/or in combination with other antibacterial or antibiotic (e.g., anti-S. aureus) regimens, and/or with other therapeutic or antibiotic agents post-infection to treat S. aureus infections. Also provided herein are bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic compositions comprising one or more digestive enzymes for use as or in disinfectants, sanitizers, detergents, and antiseptics, e.g., in hospitals, nursing homes, nurseries, daycares, schools, work environments, food service settings, public transportation and restroom facilities, to reduce, attenuate, and/or destroy S. aureus present in such settings. The surfaces treated with the described compositions can be large (e.g., operating room tables, doors, changing tables, ventilation systems) or small (e.g., medical devices, door handles); inanimate or non-living (tables) or living tissue (hands, e.g., detergents for hand-washing; wounds, e.g., surgical wounds or wounds resulting from accidents/trauma). The compositions can thus be useful to treat surfaces to reduce or eradicate S. aureus thereon, or to attenuate or reduce the infectivity of S. aureus, and thereby prevent or reduce the spread of S. aureus. Accordingly, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a method for the treatment or prevention of S. aureus infection in a bird or a mammal, comprising administering to the bird or mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes. In some embodiments, the one or more digestive enzymes comprise one or more enzymes selected from the group consisting of proteases, amylases, cellulases, sucrases, maltases, papain, and lipases.

Any reference disclosed herein, such as a patent, patent application, specification, book, article, or scientific publication, is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The term โadministrationโ or โadministeringโ refers to a method of giving a dosage of a composition or pharmaceutical composition to a vertebrate or invertebrate, including a mammal, a bird, a fish, or an amphibian, where the method is by any route, e.g., intrarespiratory, nasal, topical, oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, transmucosal, buccal, rectal, vaginal, or sublingual. The preferred method of administration can vary depending on various factors, e.g., the components of the pharmaceutical composition, the site of the disease, the disease involved, and the severity of the disease. The term โmammalโ is used in its usual biological sense. Thus, it specifically includes humans, cattle, horses, dogs, and cats, but also includes many other species. The term โpharmaceutically acceptable carrierโ or โpharmaceutically acceptable excipientโ includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredients, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients, such as antibiotics, antifungals, antimicrobials, can also be incorporated into the compositions. In addition, various adjuvants such as are commonly used in the art may be included. These and other such compounds are described in the literature, e.g., in the Merck Index, Merck & Company, Rahway, NJ. Considerations for the inclusion of various components in pharmaceutical compositions are described, e.g., in Gilman et al. (Eds.) (2006); Goodman and Gilmanโs: The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th Ed., The McGraw-Hill Companies. โSubjectโ or โpatientโ or โindividualโ as used herein, means a human or a non-human mammal, e.g., a dog, a cat, a mouse, a rat, a cow, a sheep, a pig, a goat, a non-human primate or a bird, e.g., a chicken, as well as any other vertebrate or invertebrate. By โtherapeutically effective amountโ or โpharmaceutically effective amountโ is typically one which is sufficient to achieve the desired effect and may vary according to the nature and severity of the disease condition, the nature of the subject, and the potency of the composition. It will be appreciated that different concentrations may be employed for prophylaxis than for treatment of an active disease. This amount can further depend upon the patientโs height, weight, sex, age and medical history. A therapeutic effect relieves, to some extent, one or more of the symptoms of the disease, and includes curing a disease. โCuringโ means that the symptoms of active disease are eliminated. However, certain long-term or permanent effects of the disease may exist even after a cure is obtained (such as tissue damage). โTreat,โ โtreatment,โ or โtreating,โ as used herein refers to administering a pharmaceutical composition for therapeutic purposes. The term โtherapeutic treatmentโ refers to administering treatment to a patient already suffering from a disease thus causing a therapeutically beneficial effect, such as ameliorating existing symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, ameliorating or preventing the underlying metabolic causes of symptoms, postponing or preventing the further development of a disorder and/or reducing the severity of symptoms that will or are expected to develop. The present disclosure provides compositions comprising one or more digestive enzymes and methods of using the same for the treatment and/or prevention of S. aureus infections, including antibiotic-resistant forms of S. aureus such as MRSA and VRSA. The present disclosure also provides compositions comprising one or more digestive enzymes and methods of using the same as antiseptics, detergents, disinfectants, and sanitizers, e.g., as bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic compositions, to eradicate or attenuate the S. aureus and/or to reduce its infectivity. The compositions described herein include one or more digestive enzymes, which are postulated to assist in the reduction, weakening, or eradication of S. aureus, and thus to prevent contraction of S. aureus infections or to treat S. aureus infections (e.g., improve or ameliorate the symptoms or reduce the time course of the infection). Compositions A composition for use as described herein can include one or more digestive enzymes. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that the digestive enzyme(s) in the composition can degrade S. aureus cell wall, membrane, and/or protein structures, leading to the bacteriostatic and/or bacteriocidal activity. The compositions demonstrate species-specific bacteriocidal/bacteriostatic activity against S. aureus and ฮ. coli, but not against S. enterica, possibly demonstrating that the vulnerability of the two organisms derives from proteolytic degradation of a similar protein sequence present in the two organisms. A digestive enzyme as described herein is an enzyme that can break down one or more components of food (e.g., proteins, fats, carbohydrates). The digestive enzymes can be animalderived (e.g., pancreatic or other digestive-track enzymes), or plant-, fungal-, or microorganismderived enzymes, or can be synthetically prepared. Many digestive enzymes are commercially available or can be isolated and purified from other sources by methods well known to those having ordinary skill in the art. Enzymatic activity of the enzymes can also be evaluated using standard assays. The digestive enzymes can be used in any combination of type of enzyme and any combination of enzyme sources. In some embodiments, the one or more digestive enzymes comprise one or more enzymes selected from the group consisting of proteases, amylases, cellulases, sucrases, maltases, papain (e.g., from papaya), bromelain (e.g., from pineapple), hydrolases, and lipases. In some embodiments, the one or more digestive enzymes comprise one or more pancreatic enzymes. In some embodiments, the composition comprises one or more proteases, one or more lipases, and one or more amylases. In some embodiments, the one or more proteases comprise chymotrypsin and trypsin. In some embodiments, a composition as described herein consists essentially of, or consists of, the one or more digestive enzymes. In certain embodiments, the composition can comprise at least one amylase, at least two proteases, and at least one lipase. In certain embodiments, the composition can further include one or more hydrolases, papain, bromelain, papaya, cellulases, pancreatin, sucrases, and maltases. As indicated, the one or more digestive enzymes can be derived from an animal source. In some embodiments, the animal source is a pig, e.g., a pig pancreas. Pig pancreatic enzyme extracts and formulations are known to those having ordinary skill in the art and are commercially available or can be prepared using known methods. For example, a pancreatic enzyme composition can be purchased from Scientific Protein Laboratories (designated PEC). A pancreatic enzyme composition, or any composition herein, can be adjusted to modify the amount of one or more digestive enzymes contained therein, e.g., the lipase, amylase, or protease content, such as by production and/or processing methods or by the selective addition of exogenous enzymes, activators, or inhibitors to the composition. In certain circumstances, it may be desirable to have relatively higher activity of proteases than lipases. Thus, in some embodiments, a composition comprises at least one protease and at least one lipase, wherein the ratio of total proteases to total lipases (in USP units) ranges from about 1:1 to about 20:1 including 1:1, 2:1, 3อพ1, 4:1, 5อพ1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 11อพ1, 12อพ1, 13อพ1, 14:1, 15:1, 16อพ1, 17:1, 18:1, 19:1 and 20:1, long with all values in-between. In some embodiments, the ratio of proteases to lipases ranges from about 4:1 to about 10:1 including 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, and 10:1, along with all values in-between. In certain circumstances it may be useful to modify the amount of a particular enzymatic activity in a given composition. The activity of the one or more digestive enzymes can be adjusted in a variety of ways known to the skilled artisan, e.g., by increasing the amount of the particular enzyme, or by adjusting the components of the composition, e.g., via the use of stabilizers, inhibitors, and activators. In some embodiments, a composition described herein includes one or more proteases having an activity of from about 0.05 to about 400 USP Units per mg of the composition, or any value therebetween (e.g., 0.1; 0.2; 0.25; 0.5; 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 5 0, 55 , 60, 65 , 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 3 00, 3 5 0 USP Units per mg). In some embodiments, a composition described herein includes one or more lipases having an activity of from about 0.005 to about 50 Units per mg of the composition, or any value therebetween (e.g., 0.01, 0.02, 0.025, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 35, 38, 40, 45 USP Units per mg). In some embodiments, a composition described herein includes one or more amylases having an activity of from about 0.05 to about 400 USP Units per mg of the composition, or any value therebetween (e.g., 0.1; 0.2; 0.25; 0.5; 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 USP Units per mg). In some embodiments, a composition described herein includes one or more proteases in the above activity range, one or more lipases in the above activity range, and one or more amylases in the above activity range. One exemplary embodiment includes one or more proteases having an activity in the range of about 150-250 USP units/mg; one or more lipases having an activity in the range of about 20-40 USP units/mg; and one or more amylases having an activity in the range of about 200-300 USP units/mg. In some embodiments, a composition can be formulated so as to stabilize the one or more digestive enzymes, e.g., to preserve the enzymatic activity of the enzymes. Stabilization techniques can limit or prevent auto-degradation of the one or more enzymes in a composition and help maintain enzymatic activity, increase shelflife, and aid in the tolerance of the activity of the compositions to changes in temperature, humidity, and storage conditions. For example, in some embodiments, the one or more enzymes in the composition are encapsulated, e.g., lipid-encapsulated. In other applications, variations in excipients, pH, enzyme inhibitors, etc. can be employed to aid in stabilizing the enzymes. Appropriate stabilization techniques will depend on the intended application for the composition (e.g., antibiotic vs. detergent), the route of administration, the form of the composition, the intended site of delivery/activity, and other factors, and can be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art. Certain useful enzyme activity stabilizers include compounds that provide a source of free calcium in a solution such as for example calcium salts; alkyl or branched alcohols such as for example ethanol and isopropyl alcohol; alkanolamines such as for example triethanolamine; acids, such as organic acids; and mixtures of petroleum distillates. In certain embodiments, an enzyme activity stabilizer can be a composition selected from (1) compositions known to be effective in stabilizing enzymes in liquid aqueous solutions, including enzyme stabilizing compounds and systems, (2) selected โmicelle inhibitorsโ, and mixtures of (1) and (2). In some embodiments, the activity stabilizer is a suitable concentration of boron anions. In some cases, the activity stabilizer is solvated in a polyol and may be combined with enzyme stabilizing synergists or adjuvants forming an enzyme stabilizing system. Preferred โmicelle inhibitorsโ include species known to modify as well as to inhibit micelle formation and may be selected from water miscible solvents such as C1-C6 alkanols, C1-C6 diols, C2-C24 alkylene glycol ethers, alkylene glycol alkyl ethers, and mixtures thereof. A highly preferred micelle inhibitor is di-(propylene glycol) methyl ether (โDPMโ) and analogues thereof which modify micelle formation. One example of an โenzyme stabilizing systemโ is a boron compound (e.g. boric acid ) which in the past has been used alone or with selected other adjuvants and or synergists (e.g. polyfunctional amino compounds, antioxidants, etc) to protect proteolytic and other enzymes in storage and in various products. An activity stabilizer may be chosen to substantially minimize the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (โMICโ) of digestive enzyme in the formulation. MIC is a measure of the minimum concentration of the biocide which succeeds in preventing bacterial growth in a culture during a specified time period, for example 24 hrs. Details of the MIC test are shown in โBailey & Scott โDiagnostic Microbiologyโ, 8th edition, 1990 at page 177. In some embodiments, a composition described herein can be coated with a variety or natural or synthetic coatings, e.g., to provide timed release of the enzymes, to provide flavor or odor masking, or to stabilize the enzymes. Coated enzyme preparations, including lipid-coated or lipid-encapsulated enzyme compositions, comprising one or more digestive enzymes useful for the methods and compositions described herein are disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 12/386,051, filed April 13, 2009, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such coated preparations can provide desired features, including increased shelf stability, reduced aerosolization of powder or solid formulations, odor and taste-masking, enzyme stabilization, and delayed or timed release of the enzymes. Other additives for inclusion in the compositions described herein can be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art, and will be based on a number of features, including intended application, e.g., human vs. veterinary applications; desired release profile; desired pharmacokinetics; safety; stability; and physical characteristics (smell, color, taste, pour, aerosilization). Suitable formulation ingredients, excipients, binders, bulking agents, flavorants, colorants, etc. can be determined and evaluated by methods known to those having ordinary skill. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Antibiotics for Human or Veterinary Use Compositions described herein can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions, e.g., can include a composition as described previously formulated with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. The pharmaceutical compositions are useful for treating or preventing S. aureus infections in humans and other animals, such as mammals (e.g., cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goat, monkey, cats, dogs, mice, rats) and birds (chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese). A pharmaceutical composition for treating S. aureus infections can also be referred to as an antibiotic or antibiotic composition herein. The susceptibility of S. aureus, including MRSA and VRSA, to an antibiotic composition described herein can be determined by methods known to those having ordinary skill in the art. One rapid procedure uses commercially filter paper disks that have been impregnated with a specific quantity of the antibiotic composition. These disks are placed on the surface of agar plates that have been streaked with a culture of the S. aureus being tested, and the plates are observed for zones of growth inhibition. The broth dilution susceptibility test involves preparing test tubes containing serial dilutions of the composition in liquid culture media, then inoculating the organism being tested into the tubes. The lowest concentration of drug that inhibits growth of the bacteria after a suitable period of incubation is reported as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The resistance or susceptibility of S. aureus to an antibiotic described herein can be determined on the basis of clinical outcome, i.e., whether administration of that antibiotic to a subject infected by that organism will successfully cure the subject. Alternatively, to facilitate the identification of antibiotic resistance or susceptibility using in vitro test results, the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) has formulated standards for antibiotic susceptibility that correlate clinical outcome to in vitro determinations of the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotic. Administration of the pharmaceutical compositions herein can be via any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, topically, transdermally, transmucosally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonarilly, vaginally, rectally, or intraocularly. Oral, transmucosal, topical, and parenteral administrations, for example, are customary in treating S. aureus infection indications. In the pharmaceutical compositions, effective concentrations of one or more digestive enzymes are mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient or carrier. The concentrations of the digestive enzymes in the compositions are effective for delivery of an amount, upon administration, that is useful in the reduction or eradication of S. aureus bacteria, and/or to treat or ameliorate of one or more of the symptoms associated with S. aureus infection. Antiobiotic compositions can be formulated for single dosage administration. To formulate a composition, the weight fraction of digestive enzymes is dissolved, suspended, dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected carrier at an effective concentration such that the bacteria are reduced or eradicated, the treated condition is relieved, or one or more symptoms are ameliorated. The digestive enzymes are included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. The therapeutically effective concentration may be determined empirically by testing the digestive enzymes in in vitro and in vivo, and then extrapolated therefrom for dosages for humans. The concentration of digestive enzymes in the pharmaceutical composition will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the enzymes, the physicochemical characteristics of the enzymes, the dosage schedule, the dosage form, and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed compositions. Upon mixing or addition of the digestive enzymes, the resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, gel, powder, emulsion or the like. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the digestive enzymes in the selected carrier or vehicle. Compositions intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products. Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions include solid, semi-solid, liquid, gel, powder, and aerosol dosage forms, such as, e.g., tablets, capsules, caplets, sprinkles, powders, liquids, suspensions, emulsions, gels, suppositories, aerosols or the like. They may be obtained, for example, as films by methods such as precipitation, crystallization, freeze drying, spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio frequency drying may be used for this purpose. The compositions can also be administered in sustained or controlled release dosage forms, including depot injections, osmotic pumps, pills, specialized coatings (e.g., enteric coatings) on oral dosage forms, transdermal (including electrotransport) patches, and the like, for prolonged and/or timed, pulsed administration at a predetermined rate. In some embodiments, the compositions are provided in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of a precise dose. The compositions can be administered either alone or more typically in combination with a conventional pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or the like. The term "excipient" is used herein to describe any ingredient other than the compound(s) (enzymes) used in the composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, selfemulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) such as d-a-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate, surfactants used in pharmaceutical dosage forms such as Tweens or other similar polymeric delivery matrices, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium-chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, and wool fat. Cyclodextrins such as ฮฑ-, ฮฒ, and ฮณcyclodextrin, or chemically modified derivatives such as hydroxyalkylcyclodextrins, including 2- and 3-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrins, or other solubilized derivatives can also be advantageously used to enhance delivery of compositions described herein. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Edition (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. 2005). In one preferred embodiment, the compositions will take the form of a unit dosage form such as a pill or tablet and thus the composition may contain, along with the active ingredient, a diluent such as lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, or the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or the like; and a binder such as starch, gum acacia, polyvinylpyrrolidine, gelatin, cellulose, cellulose derivatives or the like. In another solid dosage form, a powder, solution or suspension (e.g., in propylene carbonate, vegetable oils or triglycerides) is encapsulated in a gelatin capsule. Unit dosage forms in which two or more ingredients are physically separated are also contemplated; e.g., capsules with granules of enzyme(s) and granules of other ingredients; two-layer tablets; two-compartment gel caps, etc. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc. one or more digestive enzymes and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier (e.g., water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, glycols, ethanol or the like) to form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition can also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents, solubilizing agents, pH buffering agents and the like (e.g., sodium acetate, sodium citrate, cyclodextrine derivatives, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine acetate, triethanolamine oleate, and the like). Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, as emulsions, or in solid forms suitable for dissolution or suspension in liquid prior to injection. Solid compositions can be provided in various different types of dosage forms, depending on the physicochemical properties of the enzymes, the desired dissolution rate, cost considerations, and other criteria. In one of the embodiments, the solid composition is a single unit. This implies that one unit dose of the drug is comprised in a single, physically shaped solid form or article. In other words, the solid composition is coherent, which is in contrast to a multiple unit dosage form, in which the units are incoherent. Examples of single units which may be used as dosage forms for the solid composition include tablets, such as compressed tablets, film-like units, foil-like units, wafers, lyophilized matrix units, and the like. In one embodiment, the solid composition is a highly porous lyophilized form. Such lyophilizates, sometimes also called wafers or lyophilized tablets, are particularly useful for their rapid disintegration, which also enables the rapid dissolution of the active compound. On the other hand, for some applications the solid composition may also be formed as a multiple unit dosage form. Examples of multiple units are powders, sprinkles, granules, microparticles, microcapsules, pellets, beads, lyophilized powders, and the like. In one embodiment, the solid composition is a lyophilized powder. Such a dispersed lyophilized system comprises a multitude of powder particles, and due to the lyophilization process used in the formation of the powder, each particle has an irregular, porous microstructure through which the powder is capable of absorbing water very rapidly, resulting in quick dissolution. In another embodiment, the solid composition is a sprinkle formulation. Another type of multiparticulate system which is also capable of achieving rapid drug dissolution is that of powders, granules, or pellets from water-soluble excipients which are coated with the composition ingredients (e.g., enzymes), so that the enzymes are located at the outer surface of the individual particles. In this type of system, the water-soluble low molecular weight excipient is useful for preparing the cores of such coated particles, which can be subsequently coated with a coating composition comprising the enzyme(s) and, preferably, one or more additional excipients, such as a binder, a pore former, a saccharide, a sugar alcohol, a filmforming polymer, a plasticizer, or other excipients used in pharmaceutical coating compositions. Appropriate dosages for treating or preventing S. aureus infections will depend on the patient (species, age, weight, health), the severity of the disease, the strain of the S. aureus present, the type of formulation (e.g., liquid or ointment) and other factors known to those having ordinary skill in the art. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular patient, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises per dose: amylases from about 10,000 to about 60,000 U.S.P, including 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25.000, 30,000, 35,000, 40,000, 45,000, 50,000, 55,000, and 60,000 U.S.P, along with all values in-between, proteases from about 10,000 to about 70,000 U.S.P, including 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, 35,000, 40,000, 45,000, 50,000, 55,000, 60.000, 65,000, and 70,000, along with all values in-between, and lipases from about 4,000 to about 30,000 U.S.P, including, 4,000, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, and 30,000, along with all values in-between. A pharmaceutical composition can include one or more of: chymotrypsin from about 2 to about 5 mg including 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 mg, along with all values in-between; trypsin from about 60 to about 100 mg including 50, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85,90, 95, and 100 mg, including all values in between; papain from about 3,000 to about 10,000 USP units including 3.000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000, and 10,000 USP, along with all values in between; and papaya from about 30 to about 60 mg, including 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 mg, along with all values in between. Additional information on particular dosage forms of the compositions is provided below. 1. Compositions for oral administration Oral pharmaceutical dosage forms are either solid, gel or liquid. The solid dosage forms are tablets, capsules, granules, and bulk powders. Types of oral tablets include compressed, chewable lozenges and tablets which may be enteric-coated, sugar-coated or film-coated. Capsules may be hard or soft gelatin capsules, while granules and powders may be provided in non-effervescent or effervescent form with the combination of other ingredients known to those skilled in the art. a. Solid compositions for oral administration In certain embodiments, the formulations are solid dosage forms, in one embodiment, capsules or tablets. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain one or more of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder; a lubricant; a diluent; a glidant; a disintegrating agent; a coloring agent; a sweetening agent; a flavoring agent; a wetting agent; an emetic coating; and a film coating.

For example, the composition can be formulated in an enteric coating that maintains its integrity in the stomach and releases the digestive enzymes in the intestine. The composition may also be formulated in combination with an antacid or other such ingredient. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar and other enteric agents. The digestive enzymes can also be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, sprinkle, chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active digestive enzymes, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors. The digestive enzymes can also be mixed with other active materials which do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, such as antacids, H2 blockers, and diuretics. Higher concentrations, up to about 98% by weight of the digestive enzymes may be included. In all embodiments, tablets and capsules formulations may be coated as known by those of skill in the art in order to modify or sustain dissolution of the digestive enzymes. Thus, for example, they may be coated with a conventional enterically digestible coating, such as phenylsalicylate, waxes and cellulose acetate phthalate. b.

Such solutions, and the preparation and encapsulation thereof, are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,328,245; 4,409,239; and 4,410,545. For a liquid dosage form, the solution, e.g., for example, in a polyethylene glycol, may be diluted with a sufficient quantity of a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier, e.g., water, to be easily measured for administration. Alternatively, liquid or semi-solid oral formulations may be prepared by dissolving or dispersing the digestive enzymes in vegetable oils, glycols, triglycerides, propylene glycol esters (e.g., propylene carbonate) and other such carriers, and encapsulating these solutions or suspensions in hard or soft gelatin capsule shells.

Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. The injectables, solutions and emulsions also contain one or more excipients. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol or ethanol. In addition, if desired, the pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, stabilizers, solubility enhancers, and other such agents, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate and cyclodextrins. Implantation of a slow-release or sustained-release system, such that a constant level of dosage is maintained (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,710,795) is also contemplated herein. Briefly, digestive enzymes provided herein are dispersed in a solid inner matrix, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polyethylene, ethylene-vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, collagen, cross-linked polyvinylalcohol and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethyl siloxanes, neoprene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and ethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, that is insoluble in body fluids. The digestive enzymes diffuse through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of digestive enzymes contained in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the activity of the digestive enzyme or mixture thereof and the needs of the subject. Parenteral administration of the compositions includes intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations. Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile solutions ready for injection, sterile dry soluble products, such as lyophilized powders, ready to be combined with a solvent just prior to use, including hypodermic tablets, sterile suspensions ready for injection, sterile dry insoluble products ready to be combined with a vehicle just prior to use and sterile emulsions. The solutions may be either aqueous or nonaqueous. If administered intravenously, suitable carriers include physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and solutions containing thickening and solubilizing agents, such as glucose, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol and mixtures thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in parenteral preparations include aqueous vehicles, nonaqueous vehicles, antimicrobial agents, isotonic agents, buffers, antioxidants, local anesthetics, suspending and dispersing agents, emulsifying agents, sequestering or chelating agents and other pharmaceutically acceptable substances. Examples of aqueous vehicles include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringers Injection, Isotonic Dextrose Injection, Sterile Water Injection, Dextrose and Lactated Ringers Injection. Nonaqueous parenteral vehicles include fixed oils of vegetable origin, cottonseed oil, com oil, sesame oil and peanut oil. Antimicrobial agents in bacteriostatic or fungistatic concentrations must be added to parenteral preparations packaged in multiple-dose containers which include phenols or cresols, mercurials, benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, methyl and propyl p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters, thimerosal, benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium chloride. Isotonic agents include sodium chloride and dextrose. Buffers include phosphate and citrate. Antioxidants include sodium bisulfate. Local anesthetics include procaine hydrochloride.

Pharmaceutical carriers also include ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol for water miscible vehicles; and sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, citric acid or lactic acid for pH adjustment. The unit-dose parenteral preparations are packaged in an ampoule, a vial or a syringe with a needle. All preparations for parenteral administration must be sterile, as is known and practiced in the art. Illustratively, intravenous or intraarterial infusion of a sterile aqueous solution containing digestive enzymes is an effective mode of administration. Another embodiment is a sterile aqueous or oily solution or suspension containing digestive enzymes that can be injected as necessary to produce the desired pharmacological effect. Injectables are designed for local and systemic administration. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective dosage is formulated to contain a concentration of at least about 0.1% w/w up to about 90% w/w or more, in certain embodiments more than 1% w/w of the digestive enzymes to the treated tissue(s). The digestive enzymes may be suspended in micronized or other suitable form or may be derivatized to produce a more soluble active product. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the digestive enzymes in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the condition and may be empirically determined. 3. Lyophilized powders Of interest herein are also lyophilized powders, which can be reconstituted for administration as solutions, emulsions and other mixtures. They may also be reconstituted and formulated as solids or gels. The sterile, lyophilized powder is prepared by dissolving digestive enzymes as provided herein in a suitable solvent. The solvent may contain an excipient which improves the stability or other pharmacological component of the powder or reconstituted solution, prepared from the powder. Excipients that may be used include, but are not limited to, dextrose, sorbital, fructose, com syrup, xylitol, glycerin, glucose, sucrose or other suitable agent. The solvent may also contain a buffer, such as citrate, sodium or potassium phosphate or other such buffer known to those of skill in the art at, in one embodiment, about neutral pH. Subsequent sterile filtration of the solution followed by lyophilization under standard conditions known to those of skill in the art provides the desired formulation. In one embodiment, the resulting solution will be apportioned into vials for lyophilization. Each vial will contain a single dosage or multiple dosages of the digestive enzymes. The lyophilized powder can be stored under appropriate conditions, such as at about 4 ยฐC to room temperature. Reconstitution of this lyophilized powder with water for injection provides a formulation for use in parenteral administration. For reconstitution, the lyophilized powder is added to sterile water or other suitable carrier. The precise amount depends upon the selected digestive enzymes. Such amount can be empirically determined. 4. Topical administration Topical mixtures can be prepared as described for local and systemic administration. The resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsions or the like and are formulated as creams, gels, ointments, emulsions, powders, solutions, elixirs, lotions, suspensions, tinctures, pastes, foams, aerosols, irrigations, sprays, suppositories, bandages, dermal patches or any other formulations suitable for topical administration. The digestive enzymes may be formulated as aerosols for topical application, such as by inhalation (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,044,126, 4,414,209, and 4,364,923, which describe aerosols for delivery of a steroid useful for treatment of inflammatory diseases, particularly asthma). These formulations for administration to the respiratory tract can be in the form of an aerosol or solution for a nebulizer, or as a micro fine powder for insufflation, alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case, the particles of the formulation will, in one embodiment, have diameters of less than 50 microns, in one embodiment less than 10 microns. The digestive enzymes may be formulated for local or topical application, such as for topical application to the skin and mucous membranes, such as in the eye, in the form of gels, creams, and lotions and for application to the eye or for intracistemal or intraspinal application. Topical administration is contemplated for transdermal delivery and also for administration to the eyes or mucosa, or for inhalation therapies. Nasal solutions of the digestive enzymes alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients can also be administered. These solutions, particularly those intended for ophthalmic use, may be formulated as 0.01% - 10% isotonic solutions, pH about 5-7, with appropriate salts. Powders can be formed with the aid of any suitable powder base, e.g., talc, lactose, starch, and the like. Solutions can be formulated with an aqueous or ฮทฮฟฮทaqueous base, and can also include one or more dispersing agents, suspending agents, solubilizing agents, and the like. Topical gels are prepared using polymers having a molecular weight and level of concentration effective to form a viscous solution or colloidal gel of an aqueous or non-aqueous solution or suspension of digestive enzymes. Polymers from which topical gels may be prepared include polyphosphoesters, polyethylene glycols, high molecular weight poly(lactic) acids, hydroxypropyl celluloses, chitosan, polystyrene sulfonates, and the like. Ointments, creams and lotions are formulated, for example, with an aqueous or oily base and addition of a suitable thickening agent, gelling agent, stabilizing agent, emulsifying agent, dispersing agent, suspending agent, or consistency regulating agent, and the like. Bases include water, an alcohol or an oil, such as liquid paraffin, mineral oil, or a vegetable oil, such as peanut or castor oil. Thickening agents that can be used according to the nature of the base include soft paraffin, aluminum stearate, cetostearyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, polyphosphoesters, poly(lactic acids), hydroxyethyl celluloses, hydroxypropyl celluloses, cellulose gums, acrylate polymers, hydrophilic gelling agents, chitosan, polystyrene sulfonate, petrolatum, woolfat, hydrogenated lanolin, beeswax, and the like. The ointments, pastes, creams, gels, and lotions can also contain excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc, zinc oxide, and mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can also contain excipients such as silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Solutions, suspensions or dispersions can be converted into aerosols or sprays by any of the known means routinely used for making aerosols for topical application. In general, such methods comprise pressurizing or providing a means of pressurizing a container of a solution, suspension or dispersion, usually with an inert carrier gas, and passing the pressured gas through a small orifice. Sprays and aerosols can also contain customary propellants, e.g., chlorofluorohydrocarbons or volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane. Excipients include compounds that promote skin absorption, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), partial glycerides of fatty acids, and the like, present at levels up to about 10 wt % of the total formula weight. Examples of partial fatty acid glycerides include, but are not limited to IMWITOR 742 and IMWITOR 308 available from SASOL North America, Inc. of Houston, Tex. The topical formulations may also optionally include inactive ingredients to improve cosmetic acceptability, including but not limited to, humectants, surfactants, fragrances, coloring agents, emollients, fillers, and the like. The topical compositions may also include other antibiotic agents, examples of which include bacitracin, neomycin, polymixin, beta-lactams, including penicillin, methicillin, moxalactam and cephalosporins, such as cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefamandole nafate, cefazolin, cefixime, cefinetazole, cefonioid, cefoperazone, ceforanide, cefotanme, cefotaxime, cefotetan, cefoxitin, cefpodoxime proxetil, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefriaxone, cefuroxime, cephalexin, cephalosporin C, cepahlosporin C sodium salt, cephalothin, cephalothin sodium salt, cephalothin dihydrate, cephapirin, cephradine, cefuroximeaxetil, loracarbef, and the like. Essentially any anti-infective/antibiotic agent that is effective when applied topically can be used. Thus, the methods of the present invention for both treating active infections and decolonizing skin pathogen populations include methods in which digestive enzymes are applied singularly or in combination, either with no other anti-infective agent, or with at least one other anti-infective agent. The topical compositions can be administered directly by the dusting of a powder, spraying of an aerosol or by spreading a film of an ointment, cream, lotion, solution or gel to the desired area of the skin using the fingertips of the patient or a healthcare provider or other conventional application such as a swab or wipe. The product may be first applied to the skin and spread with the fingertips or an applicator or applied to the fingertips and spread over the skin. The compositions may also optionally first be coated on the surface of a topical applicator, such as a bandage, swab, moist woven or non-woven wipe and the like, which is then applied to the portion of the skin to receive the composition. The topical compositions of the present invention can be prepared with base formulations that are essentially conventional to one of ordinary skill in the art with respect to the ingredients employed, quantities thereof, and methods of preparation, all of which require no further description. Topical compositions according to the present invention can also be prepared as a cream or lotion based on an emulsion formulation possessing heretofore unrecognized bactericidal activity, in addition to good skin compatibility and wound-healing properties that is particularly well-suited for formulation with digestive enzymes. As discussed above, the present invention is not limited to topical cream or lotion formulations. Topical formulations based on conventional sprays, mists, aerosols, lotions, creams, aqueous and non-aqueous solutions or liquids, oils, gels, ointments, pastes, unguents, emulsions and suspensions will contain an amount of digestive enzymes, and optionally one or more other anti-infective agents, in a total concentration of between about 0.125 and about 10% by weight or more, recognizing again that optimal dosages may differ only by 0.05% by weight, so that representative cream and lotion embodiments will include every 0.05% by weight concentration increment within this range. The topical compositions of the present invention are used to treat skin infections and wound infections such as surface wounds and penetrating wounds. Wounds suitable for treatment include wounds in skin abrasions, skin or surface cuts, decubiti, bums and surgical wounds. The topical compositions of the present invention can be used as well to decolonize populations of S. aureus bacteria to prevent secondary, including the pre-treatment of areas prior to surgery or catheter insertion. Mucosal delivery formulations can include digestive enzymes as described herein combined or coordinately administered with a suitable carrier or vehicle for mucosal delivery. As used herein, the term "carrier" means a pharmaceutically acceptable solid or liquid filler, diluent or encapsulating material. A water-containing liquid carrier can contain pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as acidifying agents, alkalizing agents, antimicrobial preservatives, antioxidants, buffering agents, chelating agents, complexing agents, solubilizing agents, humectants, solvents, suspending and/or viscosity-increasing agents, tonicity agents, wetting agents or other biocompatible materials. A tabulation of ingredients listed by the above categories, can be found in the U.S. Pharmacopeia National Formulary, ฯฯ. 1857-1859, 1990. Some examples of the materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as com starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, com oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution, ethyl alcohol and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non toxic compatible substances used in pharmaceutical formulations. Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions, according to the desires of the formulator. Examples of phannaceutically acceptable antioxidants include water soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; oil- soluble antioxidants such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (ฮฮฮ), butylated hydroxytoluene (ฮฮฮค), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol and the like; and metal-chelating agents such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid and the like. The amount of digestive enzymes that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the particular mode of administration. Mucosal formulations are generally sterile, particulate free and stable for pharmaceutical use. As used herein, the term "particulate free" means a formulation that meets the requirements of the USP specification for small volume parenteral solutions. The term "stable" means a formulation that fulfills all chemical and physical specifications with respect to identity, strength, quality, and purity that have been established according to the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice, as set forth by appropriate governmental regulatory bodies. Within the mucosal delivery compositions, various delivery-enhancing agents can be employed which enhance delivery of digestive enzymes into or across a mucosal surface. As used herein, "mucosal delivery-enhancing agents" include agents which enhance the release or solubility (e.g., from a formulation delivery vehicle), diffusion rate, penetration capacity and timing, uptake, residence time, stability, effective half-life, peak or sustained concentration levels, clearance and other desired mucosal delivery characteristics (e.g., as measured at the site of delivery, or at a selected target site of activity such as the bloodstream or central nervous system) of digestive enzymes or other biologically active compound(s). Enhancement of mucosal delivery can thus occur by any of a variety of mechanisms, for example by increasing the diffusion, transport, persistence or stability of the digestive enzymes, increasing membrane fluidity, modulating the availability or action of calcium and other ions that regulate intracellular or paracellular permeation, solubilizing mucosal membrane components (e.g., lipids), changing non-protein and protein sulfhydryl levels in mucosal tissues, increasing water flux across the mucosal surface, modulating epithelial junctional physiology, reducing the viscosity of mucus overlying the mucosal epithelium, reducing mucociliary clearance rates, and other mechanisms. While the mechanism of absorption promotion may vary with different intranasal delivery-enhancing agents of the invention, useful reagents in this context will not substantially adversely affect the mucosal tissue and will be selected according to the physicochemical characteristics of the particular digestive enzymes or other active or delivery- enhancing agent. In this context, delivery-enhancing agents that increase penetration or permeability of mucosal tissues will often result in some alteration of the protective permeability barrier of the mucosa. For such delivery-enhancing agents to be of value within the invention, it is generally desired that any significant changes in permeability of the mucosa be reversible within a time frame appropriate to the desired duration of drug delivery. Furthermore, there should be no substantial, cumulative toxicity, nor any permanent deleterious changes induced in the barrier properties of the mucosa with long- term use. In some embodiments, absorption-promoting agents for coordinate administration or combinatorial formulation with the digestive enzymes as described herein are selected from small hydrophilic molecules, including but not limited to, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide, ethanol, propylene glycol, and the 2-pyrrolidones. Alternatively, long-chain amphipathic molecules, for example, deacylmethyl sulfoxide, azone, sodium lauryl sulfate, oleic acid, and the bile salts, may be employed to enhance mucosal penetration of the digestive enzymes. In additional aspects, surfactants (e.g., polysorbates) are employed as adjunct compounds, processing agents, or formulation additives to enhance intranasal delivery of the digestive enzymes. These penetration-enhancing agents typically interact at either the polar head groups or the hydrophilic tail regions of molecules that comprise the lipid bilayer of epithelial cells lining the nasal mucosa (Barry, Pharmacology of the Skin, Vol. 1, ฯฯ. 121-137, Shroot et al., Eds., Karger, Basel, 1987; and Barry, J. controlled Release 6:85-97, 1987). Interaction at these sites may have the effect of disrupting the packing of the lipid molecules, increasing the fluidity of the bilayer, and facilitating transport of the digestive enzymes across the mucosal barrier. Interaction of these penetration enhancers with the polar head groups may also cause or permit the hydrophilic regions of adjacent bilayers to take up more water and move apart, thus opening the paracellular pathway to transport of the digestive enzymes. In addition to these effects, certain enhancers may have direct effects on the bulk properties of the aqueous regions of the nasal mucosa. Agents such as DMSO, polyethylene glycol, and ethanol can, if present in sufficiently high concentrations in delivery environment (e.g., by pre-administration or incorporation in a therapeutic formulation), enter the aqueous phase of the mucosa and alter its solubilizing properties, thereby enhancing the partitioning of the digestive enzymes from the vehicle into the mucosa. Additional mucosal delivery-enhancing agents that are useful within the coordinate administration and processing methods and combinatorial formulations of the invention include, but are not limited to, mixed micelles; enamines; nitric oxide donors (e.g., S- nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine, NOR1, NOR4, which are preferably co-administered with an NO scavenger such as carboxy-PITO or doclofenac sodium); sodium salicylate; glycerol esters of acetoacetic acid (e.g., glyceryl- 1, 3 -diacetoacetate or 1,2- isopropylideneglycerine-3-acetoacetate); and other release-diffusion or intra- or trans- epithelial penetration-promoting agents that are physiologically compatible for mucosal delivery. Other absorption-promoting agents are selected from a variety of carriers, bases and excipients that enhance mucosal delivery, stability, activity or trans-epithelial penetration of the digestive enzymes. These include, inter alia, clyclodextrins and P-cyclodextrin derivatives (e.g., 2-hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin and heptakis(2,6-di-0-methyl-P- cyclodextrin). These compounds, optionally conjugated with one or more of the active ingredients and further optionally formulated in an oleaginous base, enhance bioavailability in the mucosal formulations of the invention. Yet additional absorption-enhancing agents adapted for mucosal delivery include medium-chain fatty acids, including mono- and diglycerides (e.g., sodium caprate-extracts of coconut oil, Capmul), and triglycerides (e.g., amylodextrin, Estaram 299, Miglyol 810). The mucosal therapeutic and prophylactic compositions may be supplemented with any suitable penetration-promoting agent that facilitates absorption, diffusion, or penetration of digestive enzymes across mucosal barriers. The penetration promoter may be any promoter that is pharmaceutically acceptable. Thus, in more detailed aspects of the invention compositions are provided that incorporate one or more penetration-promoting agents selected from sodium salicylate and salicylic acid derivatives (e.g., acetyl salicylate, choline salicylate, salicylamide); amino acids and salts thereof (e.g. monoaminocarboxlic acids such as glycine, alanine, phenylalanine, proline, hydroxyproline; hydroxyamino acids such as serine; acidic amino acids such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid; and basic amino acids such as lysine- inclusive of their alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts); and N-acetylamino acids (ฮacetylalanine, N-acetylphenylalanine, N-acetylserine, N-acetylglycine, ฮacetyllysine, N-acetylglutamic acid, N-acetylproline, N-acetylhydroxyproline, etc.) and their salts (alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts). Also provided as penetration-promoting agents within the methods and compositions of the invention are substances which are generally used as emulsifiers (e.g. sodium oleyl phosphate, sodium lauryl phosphate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium myristyl sulfate, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl esters, etc.), caproic acid, lactic acid, malic acid and citric acid and alkali metal salts thereof, pyrrolidonecarboxylic acids, alkylpyrrolidonecarboxylic acid esters, N-alkylpyrrolidones, proline acyl esters, and the like. 5. Compositions for other routes of administration Other routes of administration, such as transdermal patches, including iontophoretic and electrophoretic devices, and rectal administration, are also contemplated herein. Transdermal patches, including iotophoretic and electrophoretic devices, are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, such patches are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,267,983, 6,261,595, 6,256,533, 6,167,301, 6,024,975, 6,010715, 5,985,317, 5,983,134, 5,948,433, and 5,860,957. For example, pharmaceutical dosage forms for rectal administration are rectal suppositories, capsules and tablets for systemic effect. Rectal suppositories are used herein mean solid bodies for insertion into the rectum which melt or soften at body temperature releasing one or more pharmacologically or therapeutically active ingredients. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances utilized in rectal suppositories are bases or vehicles and agents to raise the melting point. Examples of bases include cocoa butter (theobroma oil), glycerin-gelatin, carbowax (polyoxyethylene glycol) and appropriate mixtures of mono-, di- and triglycerides of fatty acids. Combinations of the various bases may be used. Agents to raise the melting point of suppositories include spermaceti and wax. Rectal suppositories may be prepared either by the compressed method or by molding. The weight of a rectal suppository, in one embodiment, is about 2 to 3 gm. Tablets and capsules for rectal administration are manufactured using the same pharmaceutically acceptable substance and by the same methods as for formulations for oral administration. 6. Sustained Release Formulations Also provided are sustained release formulations to deliver the digestive enzymes to the desired target. It is understood that the digestive enzymes levels are maintained over a certain period of time as is desired and can be easily determined by one skilled in the art. Such sustained and/or timed release formulations may be made by sustained release means of delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as those described in US Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3, 598,123; 4,008,719; 4,710,384; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556 and 5,733,566, the disclosures of which are each incorporated herein by reference. These pharmaceutical compositions can be used to provide slow or sustained release of one or more digestive enzymes using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or the like. Suitable sustained release formulations known to those skilled in the art, including those described herein, may be readily selected for use with the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein. Thus, single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration, such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, powders and the like, that are adapted for sustained release are contemplated herein. In one embodiment, the sustained release formulation contains an active compound such as, but not limited to, microcrystalline cellulose, maltodextrin, ethylcellulose, and magnesium stearate. As described above, all known methods for encapsulation which are compatible with properties of the disclosed digestive enzymes are contemplated herein. The sustained release formulation is encapsulated by coating particles or granules of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein with varying thickness of slowly soluble polymers or by microencapsulation. In one embodiment, the sustained release formulation is encapsulated with a coating material of varying thickness (e.g. about 1 micron to 200 microns) that allow the dissolution of the pharmaceutical composition about 48 hours to about 72 hours after administration to a mammal. In another embodiment, the coating material is a food-approved additive. In another embodiment, the sustained release formulation is a matrix dissolution device that is prepared by compressing the drug with a slowly soluble polymer carrier into a tablet. In one embodiment, the coated particles have a size range between about 0.1 to about 300 microns, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,710,384 and 5,354,556, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Each of the particles is in the form of a micromatrix, with the active ingredient uniformly distributed throughout the polymer. The digestive enzymes provided herein can be formulated as a sustained and/or timed release formulation. All sustained release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-sustained counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed sustained release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of digestive enzymes being employed to cure or control the condition. Advantages of sustained release formulations may include: 1) extended activity of the composition, 2) reduced dosage frequency, and 3) increased patient compliance. In addition, sustained release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the composition, and thus can affect the occurrence of side effects. The sustained release formulations provided herein are designed to initially release an amount of the therapeutic composition that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of compositions to maintain this level of therapeutic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level in the body, the therapeutic composition must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the composition being metabolized and excreted from the body. The sustained release of an active ingredient may be stimulated by various inducers, for example pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds. Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the digestive enzymes. In one embodiment, the digestive enzymes are formulated as controlled release powders of discrete microparticles that can be readily formulated in liquid form. The sustained release powder comprises particles containing an active ingredient and optionally, an excipient with at least one non-toxic polymer. The powder can be dispersed or suspended in a liquid vehicle and will maintain its sustained release characteristics for a useful period of time. These dispersions or suspensions have both chemical stability and stability in terms of dissolution rate. The powder may contain an excipient comprising a polymer, which may be soluble, insoluble, permeable, impermeable, or biodegradable. The polymers may be polymers or copolymers. The polymer may be a natural or synthetic polymer. Natural polymers include polypeptides (e.g., zein), polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose), and alginic acid. Representative synthetic polymers include those described, but not limited to, those described in column 3, lines 33-45 of U.S. Patent No. 5,354,556, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Particularly suitable polymers include those described, but not limited to those described in column 3, line 46-column 4, line 8 of U.S. Patent No. 5,354,556 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The sustained release compositions provided herein may be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by intramuscular injections or implants for subcutaneous tissues and various body cavities and transdermal devices. In one embodiment, intramuscular injections are formulated as aqueous or oil suspensions. In an aqueous suspension, the sustained release effect is due to, in part, a reduction in solubility of the digestive enzymes upon complexation or a decrease in dissolution rate. A similar approach is taken with oil suspensions and solutions, wherein the release rate of digestive enzymes is determined by partitioning of the digestive enzymes out of the oil into the surrounding aqueous medium. Only digestive enzymes which are oil soluble and have the desired partition characteristics are suitable. Oils that may be used for intramuscular injection include, but are not limited to, sesame, olive, arachis, maize, almond, soybean, cottonseed and castor oil. Coadministration with other Pharmaceutical Compositions The pharmaceutical compositions can be used on their own, and/or in combination with other therapeutic or antibiotic (e.g., anti-S. aureus) regimens. For example, a patient can be administered other therapeutic agents, such as anti-inflammatories or anesthetics, to address other aspects of an S. aureus infection (e.g., pain, tissue damage) or still other illnesses that the patient may be facing. In other embodiments, a patient can be administered a pharmaceutical composition as described herein, and one or more additional antibiotics. The one or more additional antibiotics can be effective against S. aureus or other bacteria, or both (e.g., if the patient has multiple infections) and can be in the same or a different format from the present pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., one can be a liquid and one can be a topical antibiotic). The major classes of antibiotics are (1) the P-lactams, including the penicillins, cephalosporins and monobactams; (2) the aminoglycosides, e.g., gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmycin, and amikacin; (3) the tetracyclines; (4) the sulfonamides and trimethoprim; (5) the fluoroquinolones, e.g., ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin; (6) vancomycin; (7) the macrolides, which include for example, erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin; and (8) other antibiotics, e.g., the polymyxins, chloramphenicol and the lincosamides. In some embodiments, the additional antibiotic can be a beta-lactam antibiotic (e.g., a penicillin or penicillin derivatives, a cephalosporin, a monobactam, a penam, a penem, an oxapenam, a carbapenem or a cabapenam, a cephem, a carbacephem, an oxacephem, a monobactam). In some embodiments, the additional antibiotic can be a beta-lactamase inhibitor. In some embodiments, the additional antibiotic can be an aminoglycosidic antibiotic. In some embodiments, the additional antibiotic is selected from penicillin or a penicillin derivative, oxacillin, amoxicillin, nafcillin, cloxacillin, methicillin, temocillin, ampicillin, co-amoxiclav, azlocillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cephalexin, cephalothin, cefazolin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefamandole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, vancomycin, teicoplanin, telavancin, bleomycin, ramoplanin, decaplanin, oritavancin, and dalbavancin. An antibiotic composition described herein and an additional antibiotic can be administered separately or in a single dosage form. If separately, they can be administered in any order and relative frequency. Disinfectants and Sanitizers Compositions comprising one or more digestive enzymes as described herein can also be used as disinfectants and sanitizers, e.g., to disinfect inanimate objects and surfaces in, without limitation, hospital, health care, home, and community settings by eradicating, attenuating or reducing S. aureus in such locations. Disinfectants are antimicrobial agents that are applied to non-living objects to destroy microorganisms. Disinfectants should generally be distinguished from antibiotics that destroy microorganisms within the body, and from antiseptics, which destroy microorganisms on living tissue. Sanitizers are disinfectants that reduce the number of microorganisms to a safe level. One definition of a sanitizer states that a sanitizer must be capable of killing 99.999%, known as a 5 log reduction, of a specific bacterial test population, and to do so within 30 seconds. The main difference between a sanitizer and a disinfectant is that at a specified use dilution, the disinfectant must have a higher kill capability for pathogenic bacteria compared to that of a sanitizer. A disinfectant or sanitizer as described herein can include one or more digestive enzymes, in various embodiments as described previously above, and can optionally include other active and inactive ingredients, including stabilizers (e.g., enzyme stabilizers), other disinfectants known to those having ordinary skill in the art, formulation excipients, colorants, perfumes, etc. One having ordinary skill in the art can select the additional active or inactive ingredients to include in a disinfectant. Examples of additional disinfectants include: sources of active chlorine (i.e., hypochlorites, chloramines, dichloroisocyanurate and trichloroisocyanurate, wet chlorine, chlorine dioxide etc.); sources of active oxygen (peroxides, such as peracetic acid, potassium persulfate, sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate and urea perhydrate); iodine and iodophor solutions (iodpovidone (povidone-iodine, Betadine), Lugol's solution, iodine tincture, iodinated nonionic surfactants); concentrated alcohols (mainly ethanol, 1-propanol, called also n-propanol and 2-propanol, called isopropanol and mixtures thereof; further, 2-phenoxyethanol and 1- and 2-phenoxypropanols); phenolic substances (such as phenol (also called "carbolic acid"), cresols (called "Lysole" in combination with liquid potassium soaps), halogenated (chlorinated, brominated) phenols, such as hexachlorophene, triclosan, trichlorophenol, tribromophenol, pentachlorophenol, Dibromol and salts thereof); cationic surfactants, such as some quaternary ammonium cations (such as benzalkonium chloride, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide or chloride, didecyldimethylammonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, benzethonium chloride) and others; non-quartemary compounds, such as chlorhexidine, glucoprotamine, octenidine dihydrochloride; strong oxidizers, such as ozone and permanganate solutions; heavy metals and their salts, such as colloidal silver, silver nitrate, mercury chloride, phenylmercury salts, copper sulfate, and copper oxidechloride; concentrated strong acids (phosphoric, nitric, sulfuric, amidosulfuric, toluenesulfonic acids) and alkalis (sodium, potassium, calcium hydroxides), such as of pH < 1 or > 13, particularly under elevated temperature (above 60ยฐC). In some cases, a disinfectant as described herein will consist essentially of the one or more digestive enzymes. In some cases, a disinfectant will consist essentially of the one or more digestive enzymes, and will not include additional disinfecting agents. A disinfectant composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes as described herein can be incorporated with other ingredients to form a variety of disinfectant products including but not limited to hand cleansers, mouthwashes, surgical scrubs, body splashes, hand sanitizer gels and foams, disinfectant wipes, and similar personal care products. Additional types of products include disinfectant foams, creams, mousses, and the like, and compositions containing organic and inorganic filler materials, such as emulsions, lotions, creams, pastes, and the like. The compositions can also be used as an antibacterial cleanser for hard surfaces, for example, sinks and countertops in hospitals, food service areas, and meat processing plants. The disinfectant compositions can also be used as disinfectant fogs and disinfectant mists. The present digestive enzyme compositions can be manufactured as dilute ready-to-use compositions, or as concentrates that are diluted prior to use. The various products in which the disinfectants are used may also include fragrances, depending on the nature of the product. For example, a pine or lemon fragrance may be desirable for use for kitchen cleaning wipes because of their appealing association with cleanliness to many consumers. Further, gels or aerosols may also be fragranced for similar or other reasons. In one embodiment, the disinfectant compositions can be used to make disinfectant wipes. A disinfectant wipe can be used to clean a variety of hard and other surfaces, including, for example, human hands and skin, medical instruments and devices, countertops, floors, walls, and windows. Wipes can be made of a variety of fabrics. Fabrics are defined to include cloths and papers, as well as woven and ฮทฮฟฮทwoven materials. The woven or nonwoven fabrics can be made of suitable materials such as rayon, nylon, or cotton, and combinations thereof. Examples of nonwoven fabrics are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,786,615; 4,395,454; and 4,199,322; which are hereby incorporated by reference. The fabrics or papers can be impregnated with the disinfectant solution by any method known in the art. The wipes can be packaged in any manner known in the art including individual blister-packs or wrapped or stacked multi-packs. In another embodiment, the disinfectant composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes can be formulated into a gel or gelatinous sanitization composition. In addition to the disinfectant compositions, the gel sanitizers can include a thickening or gelling agent, wherein โthickening agentโ and โgelling agentโ are used interchangeably. As used herein, the terms โgelโ or โgelatinousโ sanitization compositions refers to a disinfectant liquid substances that can have a viscosity from about 1,000 centipoise to about 100,000 centipoise, or from 2,000 centipoise to 50,000 centipoise in another embodiment, though these ranges are not intended to be limiting. For example, a hand gel may be considerably less viscous than a gel used for industrial cleaning or disinfectant purposes. Examples of gelling or thickening agents include but are not limited to natural gum such as guar and guar derivatives, a synthetic polymer, a clay, an oil, a wax, aloe vera gel, an acrylate homopolymer, an acrylate copolymer, a carbomer, cellulose, a cellulose derivative, algin, an algin derivative, a water-insoluble C8-C20 alcohol, carrageenan, fumed silica, mixtures thereof, and the like. The gelling agent can be present in the gelatinous sanitation composition in an amount from about 0.1 wt%to50wt%of the gelatinous composition. In another embodiment, the gelling agent is present in an amount from 0.25 wt % to 10 wt % of the gelatinous composition. The amount of gelling agent can be dependent on a variety of factors including the type of gelling agent and the desired viscosity of the gel. The gelatinous sanitizers can be used for a variety of applications including sanitization of human skin e.g., gel hand sanitizer, and hard surface sanitation. In one particular embodiment, the disinfectant composition can be mixed with natural aloe gel to form a disinfectant aloe formulation. Such a formulation would be useful for application to bums, skin infections, and other irritations. The aloe may act as a thickening agent, or may also include another thickening or gelling agent as described above, depending on the desired viscosity of the disinfectant gel. In another embodiment, a disinfectant composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes can be formulated into a disinfectant foam or foaming composition. The disinfectant foams or foaming compositions include the disinfectant composition and foaming agents. Any foaming agent known in the art can be used depending on the desired application and characteristics of the resulting disinfectant foam. As with the disinfectant composition, the disinfectant foams of the present invention can be used in both human (e.g. hand washing) and industrial applications. In another embodiment, the disinfectant composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes can be in the form of a disinfectant aerosol or fog. Fogging, also referred to as thermal fogging, is the process by which disinfectants are aerosolized. The aerosol particles of the disinfectant are suspended within the air for a period of time in order to disinfect both the air itself and surfaces, including inaccessible parts of a structure such as air vents. The aerosolized particles of disinfectant can have a particle size of from about 5 pm to about 200 pm. In another embodiment, the aerosolized particle can have a particle size of from about 20 pm to about 150 pm. Methods for evaluating the disinfectant ability of a particular composition are known to those having ordinary skill in the art. Typically, the relative effectiveness of a disinfectant can be measured by comparing how well it disinfects as compared to a known disinfectant. Phenol is one known disinfectant standard, and the corresponding rating system is called the "Phenol coefficient". The disinfectant to be tested is compared with phenol on a standard microbe, e.g., ฮ. coli or S. aureus. Disinfectants that are more effective than phenol have a coefficient > 1. Those that are less effective have a coefficient < 1. To calculate phenol coefficient, the concentration of the test compound at which the compound kills the test organism in 10 minutes, but not in 5 minutes, is divided by the concentration of phenol that kills the organism under the same conditions. The phenol coefficient may be determined in the presence of a standard amount of added organic matter or in the absence of organic matter. One particular phenol coefficient assay uses the Rideal-Walker method. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also has a method that gives a U.S. Department of Agriculture coefficient. Other methods are known to those having ordinary skill in the art. A disinfectant as described herein can have a phenol coefficient for S. aureus that is > 1, e.g., greater than 1.05, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or higher. In some cases, the phenol coefficient is in the range from about 2 to about 20, e.g., about 4 to about 10, about 2 to about 6, about 6 to about 12, or about 10 to about 15. A disinfectant as described herein can have a phenol coefficient for ฮ. coli that is > 1, e.g., greater than 1.05, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18. In some cases, the phenol coefficient is in the range from about 2 to about 20, e.g., about 4 to about 10, about 2 to about 6, about 6 to about 12, or about 10 to about 15. A disinfectant or sanitizer as described herein can be bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic to S. aureus. In some embodiments, a disinfectant or sanitizer as described herein can be bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic against MRSA or VRSA, or both. Detergents A disinfectant composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes described herein can also be formulated as a detergent. A detergent is a material intended to assist cleaning. A detergent can contain one or more digestive enzymes, as described previously, in a formulation suitable to maintain its disinfectant ability, and can contain optional active or inactive ingredients, e.g., enzyme stabilizers, additional disinfectants, bleaches, soaps, surfactants, colorants and perfumes, abrasives, pH modifiers, acids, alkalis, or caustic compounds, water softeners, oxidants, suspending agents, fabric softeners, foaming agents or anti-foaming agents, viscosity modifiers, corrosion inhibitors, and optical brighteners. A detergent as described herein can be bacteriostatic and/or bacteriocidal to S. aureus, and in some embodiments can be bacteriostatic and/or bacteriocidal against MRSA or VRSA, or both. A detergent composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes, especially those made for use with water, can include additional components such as surfactants to 'cut' (dissolve) grease and to wet surfaces, abrasives to scour, substances to modify pH or to affect performance or stability, acids for descaling or caustics to break down organic compounds, water softeners to counteract the effect of "hardness" ions, oxidants (oxidizers) for bleaching, disinfection, and breaking down organic compounds, non-surfactant materials that keep dirt in suspension, enzymes to digest proteins, fats, or carbohydrates in stains or to modify fabric feel, ingredients that modify the foaming properties of the cleaning surfactants, to either stabilize or counteract foam, ingredients to increase or decrease the viscosity of the solution, or to keep other ingredients in solution, in a detergent supplied as a water solution or gel, ingredients that affect aesthetic properties of the item to be cleaned, or of the detergent itself before or during use, such as optical brighteners, fabric softeners, colors, and perfumes, ingredients such as corrosion inhibitors to counteract damage to equipment with which the detergent is used, ingredients to reduce harm or produce benefits to skin, when the detergent is used by bare hand on inanimate objects or used to clean skin, and preservatives to prevent spoilage of other ingredients. The detergent composition may be in any convenient dry form, e.g., a bar, a tablet, a powder, a granule or a paste. It may also be a liquid detergent. The digestive enzyme(s) of the detergent composition of the invention may be stabilized using conventional stabilizing agents, e.g., a polyol such as propylene glycol or glycerol, a sugar or sugar alcohol, lactic acid, boric acid, or a boric acid derivative, e.g., an aromatic borate ester, or a phenyl boronic acid derivative such as 4-formylphenyl boronic acid, and the composition may be formulated as described in e.g. WO 92/19709 and WO 92/19708. Antiseptics Various embodiments of compositions comprising on or more digestive enzymes can also be used as antiseptic agents, e.g., to reduce, eradicate, or attenuate S. aureus on skin or other living tissues. Antiseptics are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue/skin to reduce the possibility of infection, sepsis, or putrefaction. They should generally be distinguished from antibiotics that destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants, which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects. Some antiseptics are true germicides, capable of destroying microbes (bacteriocidal), while others are bacteriostatic and only prevent or inhibit their growth. The presently described antiseptics can find particular use in hospital or healthcare settings, e.g., in hand, facial or body-wash formulations; as antiseptics for use prior to and post surgical treatment; and as antiseptics for use in cleansing and treating wounds, such as traumatic or surgical wounds. In the community setting, antiseptics are useful in any setting where community-acquired infections are of concern, e.g., daycare settings, large institutions, schools, etc. Antiseptics can also be useful in the home setting in hand, facial or body-wash formulations, or for treating wounds. An antiseptic can include one or more digestive enzymes, in various embodiments as described previously, and can optionally include one or more active or inactive ingredients, such as other antiseptic agents known to those having ordinary skill in the art, stabilizers (e.g., enzyme stabilizers), colorants, perfumes, and other excipients. Examples of antiseptic agents to include with the one or more digestive enzymes include alcohols (e.g., ethanol, 1- and 2-propanol, or mixtures thereof), quaternary ammonium compounds (benzalkonium chloride, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, cetylpyridinium chloride, and benzethonium chloride), boric acid, chlorhexidine gluconate, peroxides (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide); iodine and iodophor solutions (e.g., povidone-iodine), octenidine dihydrochloride, Phenolic (carbolic acid) and phenolic derivative compounds, sodium chloride, sodium hypochlorite, and calcium hypochlorite. An antiseptic as described herein can be bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic to S. aureus, and in some embodiments can be bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic to MRSA or VRSA, or both. In one embodiment, an antiseptic composition comprises one or more digestive enzymes and optionally one or more of an anti-inflammatory agent, an analgesic, or an anaesthetic. An anti-inflammatory agents can include steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds. In one embodiment, the antiseptic composition includes one or more steroids. In one embodiment, the antiseptic compositions can comprise an anti-inflammatory agent that is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Non-limiting examples of suitable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs include aspirin (Anacin, Ascriptin, Bayer, Bufferin, Ecotrin, Excedrin), choline and magnesium salicylates (CMT, Tricosal, Trilisate), choline salicylate (Artliropan), celecoxib (Celebrex), diclofenac potassium (Cataflam), diclofenac sodium (Voltaren, Voltaren XR), diclofenac sodium with misoprostol (Arthrotec), difiunisal (Dolobid), etodolac (Lodine, Lodine XL), fenoprofen calcium (Nalfon), flurbiprofen (Ansaid), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Motrin IB, Nuprin), indomethacin (Indocin, Indocin SR), ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis, Orudis ฮฮค, Oruvail), magnesium salicylate (Arthritab, Bayer Select, Doan's Pills, Magan, Mobidin, Mobogesic), meclofenamate sodium (Meclomen), mefenamic acid (Ponstel), meloxicam (Mobic), nabumetone (Relafen), naproxen (Naprosyn, Naprelan), naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox), oxaprozin (Daypro), piroxicam (Feldene), rofecoxib (Vioxx), salsalate (Amigesic, Anaflex 750, Disalcid, Marthritic, Mono-Gesic, Salflex, Salsitab), sodium salicylate, sulindac (Clinoril), tolmetin sodium (Tolectin), valdecoxib (Bextra), or a combination thereof. Non-limiting examples of analgesics include acetylsalicylic acid, codeine, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or tea tree oil. Non-limiting examples of anaesthetics include xylocaine, prilocaine or benzocaine. Exemplary methods of testing candidate antiseptic compositions are provided below. One skilled in the art will understand that other methods of testing the antiseptic compositions are known in the art and are also suitable for testing candidate antiseptic compositions. In vitro methods of determining the ability of candidate antiseptic compositions to kill or inhibit the growth of microbial cells such as S. aureus are well-known in the art. In general, these methods involve contacting a culture of the cells of interest with various concentrations of the candidate antiseptic compositions and monitoring the growth of the cell culture relative to an untreated control culture. A second control culture comprising cells contacted with a known anti-microbial agent may also be included in such tests, if desired. For example, the ability of a candidate antiseptic composition to inhibit the growth of microbial cells can readily be determined by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the antiseptic composition. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration that inhibits growth of the organism to a pre-determined extent. For example, a MICioo value is defined as the lowest concentration that completely inhibits growth of the organism, whereas a MIC90 value is defined as the lowest concentration that inhibits growth by 90% and a MIC50 value is defined as the lowest concentration that inhibits growth by 50%. MIC values are sometimes expressed as ranges, for example, the MICioo for an antiseptic composition may be expressed as the concentration at which no growth is observed or as a range between the concentration at which no growth is observed and the concentration of the dilution which immediately follows. Anti-bacterial MICs for candidate antiseptic compositions can be measured using a broth macro- or microdilution assay (see Amsterdam, D. (1996) "Susceptibility testing of antimicrobials in liquid media," pp.52-111. In Loman, V., ed. Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine, 4th ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD). A standardised anti-bacterial susceptibility test is provided by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) as NCCLS, 2000; document ฮ7-ฮ58. In the classical broth microdilution method, the candidate antiseptic composition is diluted in culture medium in a sterile, covered 96-well microtiter plate. An overnight culture of a single bacterial colony is diluted in sterile medium such that, after inoculation, each well in the microtiter plate contains an appropriate number of colony forming units (CFU)Anl (typically, approximately 5 ฯ 105 CFU/ml). Culture medium only (containing no bacteria) is also included as a negative control for each plate and known antibiotics are often included as positive controls. The inoculated microtiter plate is subsequently incubated at an appropriate temperature (for example, 35ยฐC - 37ยฐC for 16-48 hours). The turbidity of each well is then determined by visual inspection and/or by measuring the absorbance, or optical density (OD), at 595nm or 600nm using a microplate reader and is used as an indication of the extent of bacterial growth.. Anti-microbial effects may also be expressed as the percentage (%) inhibition of growth of a given micro-organism over a pre-determined period of time by treatment with a single concentration of a candidate antiseptic composition. This method provides a rapid method of assessing the ability of an antiseptic composition to inhibit microbial growth, for example, prior to conducting more in-depth tests, such as MIC determinations or in vivo testing. The ability of any of the present disinfectant, detergent, santitizer, and antiseptic compositions to kill or inhibit the growth of S. aureus bacteria can be tested using methods well-known in the art, including the various methods described above. Methods and protocols for testing compositions against specific bacteria can be found, for example, in Official Methods of Analysis of the AO AC, 15th Ed., Arlington Virginia 22201, USA (Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), Inc. 1 990), Designation: ฮ 1054-91 โPractices for Evaluation Inactivators of Antimicrobial Agents Used in Disinfectant, Sanitizer, Antiseptic, or Preserved Productsโ (American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 1991). As is also known in the art, in vitro Time-Kill evaluations can be performed using a modification of the methods described in the Draft European Standard, prEN 12054, โChemical Disinfectants and Antiseptics - Products for Hygienic and Surgical Handrub and Handwash Bactericidal Activity - Test Method and Requirements (1995).โ Additional methods that may be used include the log reduction test, proliferation testing, the AO AC use dilution test, or the zone of inhibition test. Other methods are described in the Examples below. Kits Also provided herein are kits. Typically, a kit includes one or more compositions as described herein. In certain embodiments, a kit can include one or more delivery or administration systems, e.g., for delivering or administering a composition as provided above, and/or directions for use of the kit (e.g., instructions for treating a patient; instructions for disinfecting a surface). In another embodiment, the kit can include a composition as described herein and a label, e.g., a label that indicates that the contents are to be administered to a patient with a S. aureus infection, or a label as to how to use the composition as a disinfectant, sanitizer, detergent, or antiseptic. Methods of Use Pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., antibiotic compositions) described previously can be used to treat or prevent S. aureus infections in animals, e.g., mammals and birds. In particular, the pharmaceutical compositions can be used to ameliorate one or more symptoms and side effects of such infections and/or to reduce or eradicate the S. aureus bacterium causing the infection. The pharmaceutical compositions can be in any appropriate dosage form, as described previously. In certain embodiments, the antibiotic compositions described herein are used to treat wounds or lesions that have become infected, e.g., wounds resulting from trauma or surgery. Such use can reduce scarring and promote wound healing in patients having infected wounds. Compositions formulated for pharmaceutical use can also be employed prophylactically, e.g., as antiseptics. Such compositions find particular use in the prophylactic treatment of surgical incisions and other wounds, to prevent S. aureus infection. The digestive enzymes provided herein can be used to treat a variety of diseases and disorders associated with infection by SA bacteria or in which SA bacteria are implicated. Certain embodiments include SA infections associated with medical devices or prostheses, e.g. catheter, grafts, prosthetic heart valves, artificial joints, etc. One to five percent of indwelling prostheses become infected which usually requires removal or replacement of the prostheses. In some embodiments, a composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes can be coated onto the medical device either at manufacture of the device or after manufacture but prior to insertion of the device. Infection during hemodialysis is another source of infection. Infection is the second leading cause of death in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Approximately 23% of bacteremias are due to access site infections. The majority of graft infections are caused by coagulate-positive (SA) and coagulatenegative staphylococci. To combat infection, the digestive enzymes alone or in combination with an antibiotic can be applied as an ointment or cream to the dialysis site prior to each hemodialysis procedure. In another embodiment, the compositions provided herein can be used to treat or prevent SA nasal and extra-nasal carriage. Infection by this organism may result in impetigenous lesions or infected wounds. It is also associated with increased infection rates following cardiac surgery, hemodialysis, orthopedic surgery and neutropenia, both disease-induced and iatrogenic. Nasal and extra-nasal carriage of staphylococci can result in hospital outbreaks of the same staphylococci strain that is colonizing a patient's or hospital worker's nasal passage or extra-nasal site. Much attention has been paid to the eradication of nasal colonization, but the results of treatment have been generally unsatisfactory. The use of topical antimicrobial substances, such as Bacitracin, Tetracycline, or Chlorhexidine, results in the suppression of nasal colonization, as opposed to its eradication. The digestive enzymes alone or in combination with an antibiotic are preferably applied intra-nasally, formulated for nasal application, as an ointment, cream or solution. Application may occur once or multiple times until the colonization of staphylococci is reduced or eliminated. In some embodiments, the compositions provided herein can be used to treat or prevent bum wound infections. Although the occurrence of invasive bum wound infections has been significantly reduced, infection remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in extensively burned patients. Infection is the predominant determinant of wound healing, incidence of complications, and outcome of bum patients. One of the main organisms responsible is SA. Frequent debridements and establishment of an epidermis, or a surrogate such as a graft or a skin substitute, is essential for prevention of infection. The digestive enzymes alone or in combination with other antibiotics and/or anesthetics or anti-inflammatories can be applied to bum wounds as an ointment or cream and/or administered systemically. Topical application may prevent systemic infection following superficial colonization or eradicate a superficial infection. Application to the skin could be done once a day or as often as dressings are changed. The systemic administration could be by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injections or infusions. Other routes of administration could also be used. Surgical wounds, especially those associated with foreign material, e.g. sutures may also be treated with the compositions provided herein. As many as 71% of all nosocomial infections occur in surgical patients, 40% of which are infections at the operative site. Despite efforts to prevent infection, it is estimated that between 500,000 and 920,000 surgical wound infections complicate the approximately 23 million surgical procedures performed annually in the United States. The infecting organisms are varied but staphylococci are important organisms in these infections. The digestive enzymes alone or with an antibiotic, anesthetic, or anti-inflammatory may be applied as an ointment, cream or liquid to the wound site or as a liquid in the wound prior to and during closure of the wound. Following closure, a composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes could be applied at dressing changes. For wounds that are infected, the composition could be applied topically and/or systemically. In some embodiments, nosocomial pneumonia may be treated or prevented using the digestive enzymes provided herein. Nosocomial pneumonias account for nearly 20% of all nosocomial infections. Patients most at risk for developing nosocomial pneumonia are those in intensive care units, patients with altered levels of consciousness, elderly patients, patients with chronic lung disease, ventilated patients, smokers and post-operative patients. In a severely compromised patient, multiantibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens are likely to be the cause of the pneumonia. One of the main organisms responsible for this infection is SA. The digestive enzymes alone or in combination with other antibiotics could be administered orally, via aerosilization, or systemically to treat pneumonia. Administration could be once a day or multiple administrations per day. In some embodiments, compositions could be administered directly into the lung via inhalation or via installation of an endotracheal tube. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic disorder of the Caucasian population. Pulmonary disease is the most common cause of premature death in cystic fibrosis patients. Optimum antimicrobial therapy for CF is not known, and it is generally believed that the introduction of better anti-pseudomonal antibiotics has been the major factor contributing to the increase in life expectancy for CF patients. One of the most common organisms associated with lung disease in CF is SA. The digestive enzyme alone or in combination with other antibiotics could be administrated orally or systemically or via aerosol to treat cystic fibrosis. Preferably, treatment is effected for up to 3 weeks during acute pulmonary disease and/or for up to 2 weeks every 2-6 months to prevent acute exacerbations. Infective endocarditis results from infection of the heart valve cusps, although any part of the endocardium or any prosthetic material inserted into the heart may be involved. It is usually fatal if untreated. Most infections are nosocomial in origin, caused by pathogens increasingly resistant to available drugs. One of the main organisms responsible is SA. The digestive enzymes alone or in combination with other antibiotics could be administered orally or systemically to treat endocarditis, although systemic administration would be preferred. Treatment is preferably for 2-6 weeks in duration and may be given as a continuous infusion or multiple administration during the day. In early acute onset of osteomyelitis the vascular supply to the bone is compromised by infection extending into surrounding tissue. Within this necrotic and ischemic tissue, the bacteria may be difficult to eradicate even after an intense host response, surgery, and/or antibiotic therapy. The main organisms responsible are SA and ฮ. coli. The digestive enzymes could be administered systemically alone or in combination with other antibiotics. Treatment could be 2-6 weeks in duration. The antibiotic could be given as a continuous infusion or multiple administration during the day. A composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes could be used as an antibiotic-impregnated cement or as antibiotic coated beads for joint replacement procedures. Treatment or prevention of sepsis in immunocompromised host is also provided. Treatment of infections in patients who are immunocompromised by virtue of chemotherapy-induced granulocytopenia and immunosuppression related to organ or bone marrow transplantation represents a significant challenge. The neutropenic patient is especially susceptible to bacterial infection, so antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly to cover likely pathogens, if infection is suspected. Organisms likely to cause infections in granulocytopenic patients are: SA and ฮ. coli. The digestive enzyme composition alone or with an antibiotic is preferably administered orally or systemically for 2-6 weeks in duration. The digestive enzymes could be given as a continuous infusion or via multiple administrations during the day. Disinfectant, sanitizing, and detergent compositions as described herein can be applied to non-living surfaces in the appropriate amounts and manner to reduce or eradicate S. aureus on such surfaces, and thus can reduce or prevent S. aureus transmission and/or infectivity. Concentrations, timing, and frequency of treatment are parameters that can be determined by one having ordinary skill in the art. Any surface can be disinfected with the described compositions, including a variety of medical devices used in the hospital or health-care setting. As used herein, โmedical deviceโ refers to any device for use in or on a patient, such as an implant or prosthesis. Such devices include, without limitation, synthetic vascular grafts, blood monitoring devices, artificial heart valves, scalpel, knife, scissors, spatula, expander, clip, tweezer, speculum, retractor, suture, surgical mesh, chisel, drill, level, rasp, saw, splint, caliper, clamp, forceps, hook, lancet, needle, cannula, curette, depressor, dilator, elevator, articulator, extractor, probe, staple, catheter, stent, tubing, bowl, tray, sponge, snare, spoon, syringe, pacemaker, screw, plate, or pin. Other community and hospital or health-care surfaces suspected of harboring S. aureus can be disinfected, including large or small surfaces (floors, tables, changing tables, beds, ventilation systems, tubs, door handles, counters, food service surfaces, etc.). The compositions can also find use in hand or body washes, e.g., at points of entry to community settings, hospital rooms, or bathrooms. The compositions provided herein may be used in the manner of common disinfectants or in any situation in which microorganisms are undesirable. For example, they may be used as surface disinfectants, in coatings for medical devices, in coatings for clothing, such as to inhibit growth of bacteria or repel mosquitoes, in filters for air purification, such as on an airplane or in community or hospital settings, in water purification system, as constituents of shampoos and soaps, as food preservatives, cosmetic preservatives, media preservatives, in herbicides or insecticides, as constituents of building materials, such as in silicone sealant, and in animal product processing, such as the curing of animal hides or in slaughterhouses. For these purposes, typically the digestive enzymes alone or in conjunction with other disinfectants or detergents are included in the compositions and applied with an appropriate applicator. They also may be incorporated or impregnated into the material during manufacture, such as for an air filter, or otherwise applied to the material or the object. For example, in some embodiments, a composition described herein can be mixed in with the material, for example during manufacturing of the material or at a subsequent time. In addition, a composition can be applied to the surface of a material, either during manufacturing or at a subsequent time. As used herein, the term โsuitable materialโ means any material on, to, or in which the digestive enzymes can be applied or incorporated, thereby incorporating an antimicrobial activity in/on the material. For example, a gauze pad on a bandage can be manufactured with a composition comprising one or more digestive enzymes in or on the gauze, and/or an ointment comprising one or more digestive enzymes can be applied to the gauze thereby incorporating antimicrobial activity to the gauze. Examples of suitable materials in which digestive enzymes may be used, include, but are not limited to: foods, liquids, a medical deivce (e.g. surgical instruments), a bead, a film, a monofilament, an unwoven fabric, sponge, cloth, a knitted fabric, a short fiber, a tube, a hollow fiber, an artificial organ, a catheter, a suture, a membrane, a bandage, and gauze. The digestive enzymes may be applied or mixed into numerous other types of materials that are suitable for use in medical, health, food safety, or environmental cleaning activities. Veterinary Applications The compositions described herein, in pharmaceutical or disinfectant/sanitizer, detergent or antiseptic formats, can also be used in a variety of veterinary applications. For example, many mammals, including dogs, cats, and cows, can be infected with S. aureus or act as carriers of the bacteria. Mastitis in cows is frequently caused by S. aureus infections. Accordingly, the present compositions can be used to treat animals infected with or suspected to carry S. aureus in order to treat the infection or to prevent transmission to other animals, including humans. Disinfectant and detergent compositions can be used to treat animal living quarters and equipment that comes into contact with the animals, while antiseptics and antibiotic formulations can be used to treat animals to prevent or treat infection. For example, the digestive enzymes provided herein can be used for the prevention and treatment of mastitis, particularly mastitis in dairy cattle, though any mastitis can be treated using the digestive enzymes provided herein. Mastitis in dairy cattle is an inflammation of the mammary gland in response to intramammary bacterial infection, mechanical trauma, or chemical trauma. It is thought that contagious mastitis is primarily caused by SA and Streptococcal agalactiae. Environmental mastitis can be caused by a variety of different bacteria, including, but not limited to, ฮ. pneumoniae, ฮ. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcal uberis, Streptococcal bovis, and Streptococcal dysgalactia. In some embodiments, prevention of bovine mastitis can include daily teatdipping with a solution comprising one or more digestive enzymes. In some embodiments, the solution comprising one or more digestive enzymes may further include one or more additional antibiotics. When infection does occur, intramammary infusion of one or more digestive enzymes may be implemented. As above, additional antibiotics may also be administered in conjunction with the digestive enzymes. Typically, the digestive enzymes are administered by intramammary injection; however, effective dosages may be administered parenterally, percutaneously, by implant and also by dipping. In some embodiments, bovine mastitis can be treated by administering an effective amount of one or more digestive enzymes to a cow. The administration may be a prophylactic administration, in that all cattle in the herd are treated with a digestive enzyme composition, or the administration may occur when infection occurs in individual cows. Introduction of SA bacteria and ฮ. coli bacteria can occur during the preparation of beef, poultry, fish and pork products. Accordingly, in some embodiments, reduction of infection can be provided through administration of one or more digestive enzymes to an animal (e.g., cow, chicken, turkey, fish, or pig) to reduce the presence of ฮ. coli or SA bacteria in the intestines of the animal. Administration may occur through any available method including injection and through the introduction of one or more digestive enzymes in feed. In some embodiments, administration of one or more digestive enzymes to an animal may be used to prevent or reduce transmission of SA bacteria or ฮ. coli from the animal to other animals or humans. Administration of the digestive enzymes may be accomplished through any available method known in the art. For example, prevention or reduction of SA bacteria transmission from pigs to humans may be accomplished through administration of one or more digestive enzymes to a pig to reduce the number of SA bacteria present in the pig, thereby reducing the transmission of SA bacteria to a human. Food Applications Also provided herein is a method of preventing SA or ฮ. coli infection of beef, poultry, fish, and pork. Beef processing is a common point of contamination: during the slaughtering process, the contents of intestines or fecal material on the hide could mix with the meat, thus allowing bacteria to flourish in the warm, damp conditions. If the infected parts are then ground, the bacteria go from the surface of the cut to the interior of the ground mass. Additionally, in the production of ground beef, meat from multiple cattle is often ground together, enabling contamination from a single animal to infect an entire lot of ground beef. Accordingly, in some embodiments, reduction of infection can be provided through administration of one or more digestive enzymes to a cow to reduce the presence of bacteria in the intestines of the cow. Administration may occur through any available method including injection and through the introduction of one or more digestive enzymes in feed. In another embodiment, the reduction of contamination of meat during slaughter and grinding can be provided through the use of sprays containing one or more digestive enzymes as provided herein. Such sprays may be used, for example, in the disinfection of slaughter and grinding instruments or in the disinfection of the ground meat itself. The methods described above can further be used during the slaughter and preparation of poultry, fish and pork products (e.g., through administration or one or more digestive enzymes to poultry, fish and/or pigs prior to slaughter). ฮ. coli and SA bacteria can also be spread through unwashed fruits and vegetables. Accordingly, also provided herein is a method of washing fresh fruits and vegetables using a solution, wash, aerosol, fog, gel, or powder comprising one or more digestive enzymes as provided herein. A produce wash is a solution used to bathe the surface of produce, and typically is in contact with the produce from about 30 sec to about 5 min. A produce soak is a solution in which produce items are immersed for a time from about 30 sec to about 30 min. However, the terms and solutions can be used interchangeably unless otherwise distinguished. It is understood that the temperature at which produce is washed or soaked will influence the length of time necessary to reduce or inactivate bacteria thereon, with warmer temperatures leading to a shorter time necessary for treatment. The wash or soak solutions described herein can be used to reduce bacterial number, especially bacterial pathogen number, on the surfaces of fruits, vegetables, raw cut meat products, fish, shellfish, at the consumer level (in the household), in commercial food preparation environments, on fruits and/or vegetables prior to juicing, by wholesale or retail operators, and/or at the level of the harvest, meat packing plant or slaughterhouse, fishing boat, and so on, without limitation. The present methods are particularly useful for inactivating ฮ. coli.on the surfaces of fresh fruits and vegetables. Methods for Evaluating Activity Compositions described herein can be evaluated for a variety of activities by methods known to those having ordinary skill in the art. For example, enzymatic activities can be evaluated using standard enzyme assays. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) of the compositions can also be evaluated by methods known to those having ordinary skill in the art, as described above. Other assays, including the Phenol coefficient, are also well known to the skilled artisan. See also the Examples below. EXAMPLES Exemplary Liquid Compositions A dry pancreatic enzyme composition containing about 200 USP units/mg of protease, about 40 USP units/mg of lipase, and about 250 USP units/mg of amylase can be diluted with various diluents (water, saline, phosphate buffered solutions, pH stabilized solutions) and optionally with other active or inactive additives (enzyme stabilization systems, buffers, colorants, sanitizers, detergents, disinfectants, antiseptics) to form exemplary liquid compositions for the uses described herein. In some embodiments, the dry enzyme composition can be diluted in a ratio of mgs of the dry enzyme composition to mis of the total diluent in the range from 1 mg enzyme composition:! ml total diluent to 1 mg enzyme composition: 10,000 mis total diluent, or any value in-between, e.g., 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, 1:1000, 1:5000, or 1:10,000. Exemplary Solid Compositions A dry pancreatic enzyme composition containing about 200 USP units/mg of protease, about 40 USP units/mg of lipase, and about 250 USP units/mg of amylase can be mixed with various active or inactive dry ingredients and additives (e.g., dry detergents, disinfectants, antiseptics, and sanitizers, such as alkyl ethoxylate sulface, SDS, sodium laureth sulfate, dodecylbenzene, sodium 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonate, enzyme stabilization systems, excipients, colorants) to form exemplary solid compositions. In some embodiments, the dry enzyme composition can be mixed with total mgs of the additives in the range from 1 mg enzyme composition: 1 mg total additives to 1 mg enzyme composition: 10,000 mgs total additives, or any value in-between, e.g., 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, 1:1000, 1:5000, or 1:10,000. Exemplary Topical Formulations A dry pancreatic enzyme composition containing about 200 USP units/mg of protease, about 40 USP units/mg of lipase, and about 250 USP units/mg of amylase can be mixed with various carriers appropriate for topical pharmaceutical formulations in ratios ranging from about 1 mg of the enzyme composition to 1 mg of the carrier to about 1 mg of the enzyme composition to about 200 mg of the carrier, or any ratio therebetween (e.g., 1:2, 1:4, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:30, 1:40, 1:50, 1:75, 1:100, 1:150). For example, in one embodiment a 1:25 ratio is employed, and the carrier is petrolatum. Bacterial Limit Testing- Evaluation of Bacteriocidal and Bacteriostatic Properties The present inventors have surprisingly found in the course of doing bacterial limit testing on a dry pig pancreatic enzyme composition comprising about 200 USP units/mg protease activity, about 40 USP units/mg of lipase activity, and 250 USP units/mg of amylase activity that S. aureus bacterium do not grow in the presence of various dilutions of this material. Recovery of S. aureus CFUs from positive controls โspikedโ with S. aureus was consistently low to absent. Dilution bacterial limit testing of the dry composition in both unencapsulated and lipid-encapsulated (20% soy oil by weight of the composition) form demonstrate minimal to no recovery of the bacterium from positive controls to which a known number of CFUs of S. aureus had been added. A lack of recovery during such recovery methods suggests a bacteriostatic and/or bacteriocidal nature of the composition. Methods and Materials Sample materials - Unencapsulated Porcine Pancreatic Enzyme Concentrate (uPEC) isolated from the pig (Sus scrofa) was manufactured by a commercial supplier (Scientific Protein Labs) to contain approximately 200 U/mg protease activity, 40 U lipase activity/mg, and 250 U of amylase activity/mg. A lipid encapsulated version of this material (ePEC) was obtained by using a modified fluidized bed process and a fully hydrogenated highly purified organic oil (fully hydrogenated soy oil) which was then used to coat the enzyme particles at a percentage by weight of about 20% of the final particles. Methods: Both the ePEC and uPEC underwent standard microbial analysis for the detection of microbes. Both compositions failed to show any significant contamination using Microbial Limits Testing per USP methods. Additionally, both samples were negative/1 Og for Salmonella species and ฮ. coli. Briefly, the procedure for the examination of test compositions for microbiological suitability (i.e., estimation of the total number of viable microorganisms and freedom from specific organism) is outlined in the USP, chapter 61, โMicrobial Limit Tests.โ USP 61 outlines preparatory testing, during which is determined the test parameters wherein the test composition itself no longer inhibits the multiplication of viable organisms. USP 1227 (โValidationโ) also provides guidance to validate recovery methods. Methods for evaluating Total Aerobic Microbial Count, ฮ. Coli, and Salmonella species were performed. Total Aerobic Microbial Count: Preparation of test dilutions - Bulk dilutions of ePEC and uPEC were prepared at 1:10, 1:50, 1อพ100 and 1:200 in Tryptic Soy broth containing 4% Polysorbate 20 and 0.5% lecithin. The bulk test sample dilution was then split into separate 10 ml aliquots, where were then inoculated with a low number of colony forming units (CFUs <100/mL) of the appropriate microorganisms (S. aureus, ฮก. aeruginosa, ฮ. coli, S. enterica). One millimeter of the inoculated aliquots was plated in duplicate using the appropriate solid medium (agar). Positive controls were prepared, inoculated, and plated in a manner similar to the test samples. Negative controls were prepared, inoculated with sterile reagent, and plated in a manner similar to the test samples. The plates were incubated at 30ยฐC to 35ยฐC for two days. At the end of the period the recovery was calculated. Recovery of inoculated organisms must be at least 70% of the positive control in order to show no inhibition of growth by the test composition. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride was used to count the plates. Test for Salmonella species - Dilutions prepared with Lactose broth containing 4% polysorbate 20 and 0.5% lecithin were inoculated with <= 100 CFU of Salmonella enterica. The inoculated dilutions were incubated at 30ยฐC to 35ยฐC for 24 hours prior to 1 ml being transferred to both Selenite Cystine and Tetrahionate broths. The selective broths were incubated for 18 hours at 30ยฐC to 35ยฐC prior to being streaked to brilliant green, bismuth sulfite an xylose lysine deoxycholate agars. The selective agar plates were incubated at 30ยฐC to 35ยฐC for 24 hours. The plates were observed for colonies characteristic of Salmonella species. Where observed, a representative colony was confirmed to be Salmonella species using an API 20โฎ biochemical identification test. Test for ฮ. coli - Dilutions prepared with Lactose broth containing 4% polysorbate 20 and 0.5% lecithin were inoculated with <= 100 CFU of ฮ. coli. The inoculated dilutions were incubated at 30ยฐC to 35ยฐC for 24 hours prior to being streaked to MacKonkey agar. The plates were observed for colonies characteristic of ฮ. coli. Where observed, a representative colony was confirmed to be ฮ. coli using an API 20โฎ biochemical identification test. Results Total Aerobic Count: Test Results using the uncoated PEC (uPEC) are shown in Table 1, below. As shown, for dilutions of 1:50, 1:100, and 1:200 the percent recovery of S. aureus was 0%, demonstrating the bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic action of uPEC of S. aureus.

The ePEC percent recovery for S. enterica are also given in Table 2. For a dilution of 1:50 the recovery was 87%, for a dilution of 1:100 and 1:200 the tests were not performed. Positive controls as reported in Tables 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that the growth media for all microbiological cultures were functioning effectively. In Table 1, it can be seen that the uPEC composition was highly effective on both S. aureus and ฮ. coli. This is substantiated by the fact that recovery of positively spiked controls failed to meet the USP criterion of positive recovery (at least 70% of spiked sample CFUs recovered). It is also important to note that the bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity showed species specificity. Samples of S. enterica showed excellent recovery using both coated and uncoated PEC. Because bacteria share common cell wall and membrane structures such as lipids and peptidoglycans, it is possible that these results point to the sensitivity of a more species specific cellular component such as a protein. If lipase or amylase action alone were sufficient to induce bacterial death or suppression of growth, then it would be unlikely to see the recovery of S. enterica at such robust levels. It is possible that species specific protein(s) in S. aureus and ฮ. coli share similar peptide sequences and the appropriate local tertiary structure to allow for enzymatic attack by one or several of the proteases present in PEC, leading to a subsequent destruction of the bacterium. These results do not however, rule out a multi-staged event where action by lipases and amylases against the bacterial cell wall and membrane first expose extracellular or transmembrane proteins which have the appropriate primary and tertiary structure to lend themselves to enzymatic degradation by one or many of the PEC proteases. These results demonstrate a clear bacteriostatic effect for both lipid coated and uncoated PEC. Because this experiment relies upon an end point read out of bacterial colony growth while the subject bacteria remain in the presence of PEC, it is not possible on the basis of these results to rule out the possibility of a bacteriostatic effect only. Thus, failure to recover a sufficient number of viable colony forming units could be the result of the continued suppressive presence of the PEC material, as opposed to the induction of bacterial death. Consequently, additional experiemental testing was carried out in order to more conclusively evaluate the bactericidal capabilities of PEC. Materials and Methods: The uncoated PEC formulation described above previously was used to evaluate bacteriocidal activity of the formulations. Preparation of test dilutions - Bulk dilutions of uPEC were prepared at 1 TOO and 1:200 in Tryptic Soy broth containing 4% Polysorbate 20 and 0.5% lecithin. The bulk dilution was then split into separate 10 ml aliquots, where were then inoculated with a low number of colony forming units (CFUs <100) of the appropriate microorganisms. One millimeter of the inoculated aliquots was plated in duplicate using the appropriate solid medium (agar). Positive controls were prepared, inoculated, and plated in a manner similar to the test samples. Negative controls were prepared, inoculated with sterile reagent, and plated in a manner similar to the test samples. The plates were incubated at 30ยฐC to 35ยฐC for two days. Following this initial incubation, cultured material was then collected and washed in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and filtered in order to remove PEC. The material was resuspended in diluted in Tryptic Soy broth as per above and re-plated onto fresh solid (agar) media and incubated for an additional 2 days. At the end of this period, colonies were enumerated and the percentage recovery calculated. At the end of the period the recovery was calculated. Recovery of inoculated organisms must be at least 70% in order to show no inhibition of growth. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride was used to count the plates. Tests for ฮ. coli - Dilutions prepared with Lactose broth containing 4% polysorbate 20 and 0.5% lecithin were inoculated with <= 100 CFU of ฮ. coli. The inoculated dilutions were incubated at 30ยฐC to 35ยฐC for 24 hours prior to being streaked to MacKonkey agar. The plates were observed for colonies characteristic of ฮ. coli. Where observed, a representative colony was confirmed to be ฮ. coli using an API 20โฎ biochemical identification test. The tests were also repeated for both S. Aureus and ฮ. Coli at Dilutions of 1:20, 1:40, and 1:80. Test Results Test Results using the uncoated uPEC are given in Tables 3 and 4, below, demonstrating recovery of bacteria following replating of bacteria alone, postincubation with uPEC and washing. As shown in Table 3, for dilutions of 1:100, and 1:200, the percent recovery of S. aureus was 13% and 48%, respectively, clearly demonstrating the bacteriocidal action of uPEC on S. aureus. As shown in Table 4, the percent recovery of S. Aureus at a dilution of 1:20 is 2%, for a dilution of 1:40 it is 4%, and for a dilution of 1:80 it is 23%.

As shown in Table 3, for a dilution of 1:100 the recovery was 2%, and for a dilution of 1:200 the recovery was 28%. As shown in Table 4, the percent recovery of ฮ. Coli at dilution of 1:20 is 0%, for a dilution of 1:40 it is 0%, and for a dilution of 1:80 it is 12% Positive controls demonstrate that the growth media for all microbiological cultures were functioning effectively. This argues for a true bactericidal effect when the selected organisms are exposed to PEC. If the action of the PEC were merely bacteriostatic, removing the PEC from co-culture with the test bacteria would result in a release from any suppressive action by the PEC with a recovery of active growth. However, removal of PEC does not result in any such recovery, even though cultures were left to grow over a full 24 hr period. This strongly supports the notion that the reason the selected organisms fail to show recovery of CFUโs upon exposure to PEC is because of a bactericidal action of the PEC. This action could include mechanisms such as physical and irreversible damage to cell surface lipids, membrane proteins or bacterial capsule by enzymatic degradation, leading to extracellular and intercellular ionic electrolyte imbalances, changes in acidity, and damage to genetic material.
