BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Petroleum is a vital source of fuels for transportation, industrial chemicals that produce polymers, plastics, pharmaceuticals, paints and other important chemicals. However, due to economic, environmental and political factors, new sources besides petroleum are being sought for the production of these materials. Technologies to manufacture industrial commodities such as methanol are mature and used to produce the world's supply from synthesis gas that comes from methane, coal, etc. Ethanol is produced by fermentation and hydration of ethylene produced from petroleum. Technology to produce ethanol from cellulose is still in development. Efforts have been made to develop a synthesis of ethanol from synthesis gas but no satisfactory technologies have materialized yet. There has been increased use of ethanol as a fuel additive and also as an automotive fuel itself. Ethanol does not have a high heat of combustion (30 MJ/kg ethanol vs 45 MJ/kg gasoline) thus yielding significantly lower mileage than gasoline. Another issue with ethanol is the difficulty of ethanol transport by pipeline due to its corrosivity. Various efforts are underway to find economic fermentation processes to produce butanol which is also an important fuel alternative and industrial chemical. However the economy of these processes due to the time required for each fermentation cycle, environmental problems from large amounts of water consumption for these processes and difficulty of isolation of butanol from broths along with its toxicity to microbes are challenges that have not been overcome. The present invention avoids these issues and is a novel method to synthesize fuels and chemicals from non-petroleum sources such as biomass, coal and natural gas. The synthetic manufacture of fuels and chemicals, for example alcohols and alkanes with four or more carbons, offers the potential for higher energy fuels that are readily compatible with existing automotive and transportation infrastructure.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment of the present application, there is provided a process of using a ketene to form a diketene which is then reduced by hydrogen to form alcohol and hydrocarbon fuel and chemical raw materials. In one aspect, an acid, such as a two carbon acetic acid, is converted to a ketene which is dimerized and reduced to products with four or more carbons such as butanol, heptanol and other alcohols. The alcohols produced include compounds, such as alcohols, with three to nine carbons including butanol and its isomers, pentanol and its isomers, hexanol and its isomers, heptanol and its isomers, etc may be used as fuels which have a calorific values closer to gasoline. In another embodiment, there is provided a process of using syngas as a feedstock to produce diketene which is then selectively hydrogenated to butanol via intermediate beta-butyrolactone. Ketene may be prepared from methanol, which may be carbonylated to form acetic acid and dehydrated to form ketene. In another aspect, the process provides diketene which is then selectively hydrogenated to butanol via an intermediate acetoacetate ester such as methyl acetoacetate. Diketene is readily produced from acetic acid by dimerization of ketene, ketene is produced by pyrolysis of acetic acid and acetic acid is manufactured from syngas via carbonylation of methanol. The alcohol products produced, such as 2-butanol and 1-butanol and heptanols have a calorific value closer to gasoline than ethanol. The 1-butanol and 2-butanol product of the present invention may be used individually or as mixtures. Also disclosed is a process for converting ketene to diketene, converting diketene to dehydroacetic acid (3-acetyl-2-hydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one, “DHAA”) and reduction of DHAA to heptanols, heptanones or heptanes and other useful higher alcohols and alkanes. Diketene is prepared from acetic acid which can in turn be synthesized by the carbonylation of methanol or the oxidation of ethanol. The alcohols produced, such as 4-heptanol and some of its isomers and other products such as pentanol and its isomers, hexanol and its isomers, butanol and its isomers, heptanes and other alkanes, etc which may be used as fuels, have significantly higher calorific values close to gasoline and higher than ethanol and butanol fuel. Another aspect, there is provided a process to convert two carbon acetic acid to seven carbon products like heptane, heptanone and heptanol using ketene, ketonization and hydrogenation chemistry. Synthesis gas is converted to acetic acid which is dehydrated to form ketene which is dimerized to form diketene. Diketene is converted to butyric acid which is ketonized to form 4-heptanone. 4-Heptanone may be reduced to 4-heptanol or heptanes and other useful higher alcohols and alkanes. The resulting products, such as 4-heptanol, heptane, etc. . . . which may be used as fuels, have significantly higher calorific values close to gasoline and higher than ethanol and butanol fuel. In another aspect, the heptanol prepared according to the processes are highly selective, and produces at least 60%, 65% or 80% heptanol. The products comprising mixtures of four or more carbon alcohols and alkanes are much more amenable to transport through existing pipeline structures. Yet another aspect of the present invention is a process to convert ethanol to C5-6 alcohols, including 3-pentanol and 2-methylpentanol. In one embodiment ethanol is carbonylated to form propanoic acid which is dehydrated to form methyl ketene, methyl ketene is dimerized to form 2-methyl-4-ethylidene-oxetanone which is hydrogenated to form 2-methyl pentanol. In one embodiment, ethanol is carbonylated to form propanoic acid, propanoic acid is ketonized to form 3-pentanone and 3-pentanone is reduced to form 3-pentanol. In one aspect of the method, the fuel composition is blended with an automotive fuel. In each of the product or product mixtures prepared according to the above processes, the products may also be used as solvents and chemicals in industry. In addition, the products may be blended with fuels such as gasoline, diesel or like fossil fuels or with a biofuel or synthetic fuels, and combinations thereof.

Exemplary embodiments, aspects and variations are illustrated in the figures and drawings, and it is intended that the embodiments, aspects and variations, and the figures and drawings disclosed herein are to be considered illustrative and not limiting. As used herein, an “alkyl” group is a straight, branched, cyclic, acylic, saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic group or alcoholic group having a chain of carbon atoms. A C1-C20 alkyl or C1-C20 alkanol, for example, may include alkyl groups that have a chain of between 1 and 20 carbon atoms, and include, for example, the groups methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, vinyl, allyl, 1-propenyl, isopropenyl, ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl, 1,3-butadienyl, penta-1,3-dienyl, penta-1,4-dienyl, hexa-1,3-dienyl, hexa-1,3,5-trienyl, and the like. An alkyl group may also be represented, for example, as a —(CR1R2)m— group where R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen or are independently absent, and for example, m is 1 to 8, and such representation is also intended to cover both saturated and unsaturated alkyl groups. An “alkyl compound(s)” as used herein, is an alkyl containing 1 to 20 carbons (C1-C20 alkyl), and includes cyclic and acyclic alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ketones and aromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene etc.) and mixtures thereof. The alkyl compound may be used as a raw material for chemical processing, a solvent or the alkyl compound may be used as a fuel or mixtures of fuels. Such fuel or mixtures of fuels may be further combined with other fuel or fuel products to form a gasoline. Non-exclusive examples of an alkyl compound include butane, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 2-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol, 2-heptanol, 4-heptanol, 4-heptanone, 3-methyl cyclohexanol, 2,6-dimethyl-4-heptanol and mixtures thereof. Alkyl compounds of the present application exclude saturated beta-lactones. A “cyclyl” such as a monocyclyl or polycyclyl group includes monocyclic, or linearly fused, angularly fused or bridged polycycloalkyl, or combinations thereof. Such cyclyl group is intended to include the heterocyclyl analogs. A cyclyl group may be saturated, partially saturated or aromatic.

Examples of alcohols are methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol (including 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol), pentanol (and its isomers including 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, isopentanol, neopentanol, cyclopentanol, etc) and straight chain, branched and cyclic isomers of other higher alcohols such as hexanol, cyclohexanol, methylcyclohexanol, heptanol (including 1-heptanol, 2-heptanol, 3-heptanol, 4-heptanol, iso-heptanol and other isomers), nonanol, etc. A higher alcohol is an alcohol having two or more carbons. “Gasoline” is known to comprise of a complex mixture of volatile hydrocarbons suitable for use as a fuel in a spark-ignition internal combustion engine. Typically, gasoline boils over a range of about 27° C. to about 225° C. Gasoline may consist of a single blendstock, such as the product from a refinery alkylation unit, or it may comprise of a blend of several blendstocks. The blending of gasoline is well known in the art and may include a combination of three to twelve or more different blendstocks. Optimization of the blending process takes into account a plurality of characteristics of both the blendstocks and the resulting gasoline, and may include such characteristics as cost and various measurements of volatility, octane, boiling point characteristics and chemical composition. While hydrocarbons usually represent a major component of gasoline, certain oxygen containing organic compounds may be included as gasoline components. In one aspect, such oxygen containing organic compounds are referred to as “oxygenate” or “oxygenates,” and are important gasoline substitutes such as ethanol and butanol. Oxygenates are also useful as components in gasoline because they are usually of high octane and can be a more economical source of gasoline octane than a high octane hydrocarbon blending component such as alkylate or reformate. Oxygenates that may be used as gasoline blending agents include, but are not limited to, methanol, ethanol, tertiary-butyl alcohol, methyl tertiary-butyl ether, ethyl tertiary-butyl ether and methyl tertiary-amyl ether.

In one variation, the compounds may be synthesized by the steps outlined in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5, FIG. 6, FIG. 7, FIG. 8, FIG. 9, FIG. 10, FIG. 11, FIG. 12 or FIG. 13. Experimental The following procedures may be employed for the preparation of the compounds of the present application. The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds are either available from commercial suppliers such as SigmaAldrich, Alfa Aesar, etc or are prepared by methods well known to a person of ordinary skill in the art, following procedures described in such references as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, vols. 1-17, John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y., 1991; Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, vols. 1-5 and supps., Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989; Organic Reactions, vols. 1-40, John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y., 1991; March J.: Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y.; and Larock: Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989. Standard organic chemical reactions can be achieved by using a number of different reagents, for example, as described in Larock: Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989. Samples were analyzed on a Agilent 6890 5973 GCMS system equipped with a JW1 DB624 column with dimensions of 30 m×250 μ×1.4 μ. The method ran at 1 ml/min flow, with oven temperature at 40° C. for the first two minutes followed by temperature ramp at 10° C./min to a temperature of 240° C. which was held for 10 minutes. The solvent delay was set at 5 minutes. Chemical identities of compounds were confirmed by mass spectroscopic qualitative analysis on GCMS against a NIST 2011 library as well as by comparison of retention time against commercial standards. Analysis of samples with volatile alcohols was done on a Gowmac GC system using a Hayesep Q column with He and nitrogen carrier gases. Column temperature was 180° C., detector temp. was 150° C., injector temperature was 150° C., sample valve temperature was 105° C. detector current was 107 mA and injection volume was 1 microliter. Gas samples were analyzed on Varian Micro-GC instruments. Additionally, some product mixtures were analyzed for presence of lower alcohols by derivatizing the alcohol mixture by dissolving in methylene chloride, adding excess of diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP) and acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride. After standing for 30 minutes the reaction mixture was analyzed by GCMS. An experiment for lower molecular weight alcohol analysis was done as follows: The liquid product (30 μl) of the reaction was dissolved in 1 ml of methylene chloride, DIEA was added with a 10 μl syringe in increments until the medium was basic, 2 mg of DMAP was added followed by acetyl chloride. The solution was allowed to stand for about a half hour until the alcohols were esterified to their acetyl derivatives. The resulting mixture was analyzed on the GCMS giving a mixture with ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate and sec-butyl acetate. These values represented the approximate percentages of ethyl, isopropyl, butyl alcohols in a sample. Some tables below show a theoretical estimate of calorific values of a mixture shown. Analysis used calorific values published in literature available on the NIST website at www.nist.gov. For calorific values of molecules like 2-heptanol and 4-heptanol that were not readily available (an isomer's heat of combustion) like the 1-heptanol isomer's calorific value was used in calculations. The quality of GCMS NIST library matches are listed on the last column of tables. Apparatus used for hydrogenation reactions was fabricated in house using standard pipes and parts and instruments available from companies such as Swagelok, Omega engineering, etc. Glassware was purchased commercially or fabricated. Diketene is manufactured on an industrial scale by the dehydration of acetic acid to ketene. It can be synthesized from various other starting materials including acetic anhydride, acetone, acetyl halides, etc. Ketene was generated by thermal decomposition of acetone and dimerized to diketene at low temperature. DHAA is manufactured on commercial scale from diketene and is commercially available. Experiment 1: Synthesis of diketene: The reactor system (FIG. 15) was installed inside of a good working fume hood. The feed stream of acetone vapor was generated by passing argon through a glass bubbler filled up with acetone which was then passed to the top of a vertical hollow quartz tube with length of 47 cm and internal diameter of 22 mm. At the lower part of the quartz tube (5 cm from the bottom) was placed the removable silica foam monolith disk with 45 pores per inch, 20 mm diameter and 0.1 cm thickness. The disk was supported inside of the reactor by a built-in quartz frit and temperature of the disk was measured with an external thermocouple placed in a glass pocket located under the frit. The quartz tube was placed in a cylindrical furnace where the temperature was controlled with a PID controller. The ketene from the quartz tube was passed through a condenser cooled with cold water (bearing a graduated cylinder attached at the bottom receiver for liquid condensate) followed by three cylindrical gas traps connected in series filled with acetone and immersed in a dry ice/acetone baths. At the end of the line was installed the fourth glass trap filled up with acetone kept at room temperature with the outlet tube placed into the hood's exhausting vent. The bubbler and three glass cylinder traps were charged with 300 ml of dry acetone (99.5%) each and the traps were immersed in a dry ice/acetone bath at a temperature of minus 72° C. The fourth glass trap was charged with 150 ml of acetone at room temperature. The condenser was connected to circulating cold water (8-12° C.) from a separate water/ice bath. The furnace temperature was set to 620° C. and argon was passed through the bubbler with acetone at a flow rate 0.7-1.0 l/min to deliver acetone vapour to the quartz tube reactor. Temperature of acetone in the bubbler was maintained by a water bath at about 40° C. The furnace temperature was kept at range of 620-670° C. to maintain temperature of the silica foam disk in the reactor at 470-510° C. After 4 hours of the continuous passing of acetone stream vapour through the quartz reactor the furnace was turned off and the argon flow was reduced to 0.1 l/min. When the quartz tube reached room temperature the argon flow was stopped and the reactor system including three glass cylinder traps immersed in a dry ice/acetone bath was left to stand overnight. The acetone solutions from the three traps were collected and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum at a temperature range of 25-30° C. The resulting dark red concentrate was distilled under vacuum at 55-70° C. using a cold finger (cooled with acetone/dry ice) and the formed white solid was melted into a separate flask to give a yellowish liquid weighing 16.5 g, including 75% of diketene, 16% of acetic anhydride and 5% of acetic acid. The diketene was taken forward into the next step without further purification. Reduction of Diketene: Experiment 2: Reduction of diketene 62 hour (batch reactor): The reduction reaction was performed in a hydrogenation reactor consisting of a ½″ diameter stainless steel tube fitted with a ball valve at the bottom and a cross (Swagelok parts) on the top. A thermocouple (top arm), side arms bearing a pressure gauge and pressure relief valve and a ball valve were attached to three arms of the cross and the fourth (bottom) arm was attached to the top of the stainless steel tube. The tube was wrapped with heating rope and insulation was wrapped around the heating rope. The ball valve on the bottom of the reactor is connected to a 3″ length of ⅛″ tube immersed in a cold water bath is connected to a 1/16″ tube bearing a ball valve and needle valve to collect liquid samples from the reactor. Procedure: 10.5 g of copper/zinc catalyst CZ 29/2T (Johnson Matthey) was weighed and loaded into the hydrogenation reactor. A 5% hydrogen in argon mixture was passed over the catalyst bed at 0.8 lit/min at a temperature of 180° C. for about 18 hours to reduce the catalyst. The heating was shut off and the catalyst allowed to cool. The catalyst was removed from the reactor under an argon atmosphere in a glove bag and placed in a porcelain dish and 0.7 ml of diketene was added dropwise to the catalyst pellets. The wetted catalyst pellets were poured back into the reactor, the reactor was sealed, removed from the glove bag and purged with argon and hydrogen three times each and then hydrogen filled to a pressure of about 1100 psi. Heating was started and temperature of the catalyst bed was about 209° C. The hydrogenation was continued for about 62 hours after which the reactor was cooled and a sample of liquid collected from the reactor bottom. GCMS analysis of the sample showed the formation of higher alcohols including 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 2-pentanol, hexanol isomers, methyl cyclohexanol, heptanol isomers, etc in the reaction. GCMS qualitative analysis of higher alcohols formed is shown in Table 1 also presents a theoretical estimation of the calorific value of a mixture. Besides the major alcohol peaks in the GCMS, peaks were also observed indicating formation of esters, hydrocarbons and other oxygenated carbon compounds.

After 18 hours the catalyst was cooled to room temperature and poured into a flat porcelain dish in a glove bag under argon. 1 gm of diketene was added dropwise to the catalyst pellets to wet them as evenly as possible. The reactor was resealed, removed from the glovebag, purged thrice with argon, twice with hydrogen and then filled with hydrogen to 1100 psi. Temperature was raised to 67° C. and allowed to stand for 4 hours. A gas sample was taken for CO2 and CO analysis indicating 2.55% CO and 0.5% CO2. Heating was shut off and the reactor was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. Next morning, heating was resumed and temperature was raised to 210° C. The reaction absorbed hydrogen with pressure dropping from 1200 psi to 940 psi so hydrogen was filled as required to keep pressure in the range of 1045 to 1240 psi. After 4.5 hours of heating at 210° C. a liquid sample was taken by cooling the sampling port with ice water bath and the heating was shut off. GCMS qualitative analysis of higher alcohols formed is shown in Table 2 and also presents a theoretical estimation of the calorific value of a mixture. Mixture of products indicated complete conversion of diketene, 48% by area of higher alcohols formed of which 9.4% were 1-butanol and 2-butanol combined.

The temperature of the reactor (catalyst bed) was in the 170 to 210° C. range during the reduction. The 5% hydrogen in argon was replaced by a stream of pure hydrogen at 0.4 l/min at a temperature of 160 to 180° C. for 40 minutes. Heating was stopped and the reactor cooled down with the 5% hydrogen stream. The reactor was placed in a glove bag under argon and catalyst removed and carefully wetted dropwise with 1 ml of diketene. The catalyst wetted with the diketene was then placed back in the reactor and the reactor sealed, removed from the glove bag and purged thrice with argon. Hydrogen pressure was set to 1100 psi and heating was started. The temperature rose rapidly from room temperature to around 188° C. as hydrogen was absorbed by the reaction. Heating was switched off about 30 minutes after temperature was reached. The pressure was between 1180 to 930 psi. The reactor vapors were condensed into a liquid using an ice water bath, collected and sampled on the GCMS. GCMS analysis of the sample showed the formation of higher alcohols including 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 2-pentanol, hexanols, heptanols and methyl cyclohexanol, etc in the reaction. GCMS qualitative analysis of higher alcohols formed is shown in Table 3, also presents a theoretical estimation of the calorific value of a mixture. Besides the major alcohol peaks in the GCMS, peaks were also observed indicating formation of esters, hydrocarbons and other oxygenated carbon compounds. GCMS qualitative analysis of higher alcohols formed is shown in Table 3 and also presents a theoretical estimation of the calorific value of a mixture. Complete conversion of diketene was observed, 44% of higher alcohols of which 1-butanol and 2-butanol were 9%.

A thermocouple was attached to the top arm of the cross with one of the (cross) side arms bearing a pressure gauge, pressure relief valve and a ball valve. The other side arm of the ¼″ union cross was connected to a 1/16″ tube which was attached to a Gilson 307 HPLC pump. The 1/16″ tube entered the reactor and extended down till it was just above the catalyst bed. The bottom arm of the cross was attached to the top of the ½″ stainless steel tube. A second thermocouple was installed in the middle section to measure internal temperature. The tube was wrapped with heating rope and insulation was wrapped around the heating rope. A third thermocouple was placed under the heating rope. All three thermocouples were connected to a digital display. The ball valve on the bottom of the reactor is connected to a coil of ⅛″ stainless steel tube that was connected to 2″ length of ¼ inch tube with a drain at its bottom for liquid condensate and a vent near its top that carried out non-condensing gases. This coiled tube and lower portion were cooled with ice water and served as a trap to collect liquid. The end of the gas vent had a ball valve and the liquid collecting end had a needle valve so that it could be opened slowly to collect liquid samples. The gas outlet of the condenser, including a port for gas sampling was connected to a back pressure gauge that enabled control of reactor pressure which was in turn connected to a flow meter that vented reactor gases to the hood via a tube. Procedure: 6.5 g of the CuO—ZnO catalyst (Unicat, LS-402, 5×2 mm) was placed in the reactor and covered on top with 1.0 g glass beads. The reactor was purged with nitrogen followed by a stream of 5% H2/nitrogen at 0.4 l/min overnight with temperature of the reactor 190 -195° C. and then 5% H2/nitrogen was replaced by a stream of pure hydrogen at 0.4 l/min at 195° C. for 1 h. The reactor was initially heated to 210° C., hydrogen pressure was set up to 300 psi at hydrogen flow rate of 0.3 l/min and HPLC pump was turned on to pump diketene (GC: 95.1% diketene, 3.5% acetic acid, 0.7% acetic anhydride) at a rate of 0.05 ml/min. The experiment was run for 2.3 h at temperature gradient from 210 to 230° C. (catalyst temp at middle of the reactor) and samples of the reaction mixture were collected for GS-MS analysis (in methyl acetate). GC analysis for volatile products on a Gowmac GC against quantitative standards showed samples S3, S5, S8 contained about 31 to 32% isopropanol and about 4% ethanol each by volume. GCMS qualitative analysis of products formed is shown in Table 4, also an estimation of the calorific value of a sample mixture 2 (S2) based on the GCMS chromatogram is shown in Table 4a.

Reduction of Methyl Acetoacetate (MAA) Experiments: Experiment 12: Hydrogenation of MAA with a copper-zinc catalyst; Continuous flow reactor set up: The reduction reaction was performed in a hydrogenation reactor (made from Swagelok parts using the required unions, port connectors, reducers and valves as needed) consisting of a 1″ diameter stainless steel tube reactor chamber that held catalyst. The reactor tube was wrapped in heat tape and insulation surrounded the heating tape. Five thermocouples were affixed to the reactor to monitor catalyst bed temperatures along the length of the reactor catalyst bed. The thermocouples were connected to a digital display. The top of the reactor was connected to a T-union one side arm of the union was connected to a 1/16″ tube that was connected to a waters HPLC pump. The intake of the pump was dipped in MAA contained in a 50 ml measuring cylinder. The other arm of the T-union on the top of the reactor was connected to a pressure transducer, hydrogen supply and a differential pressure gauge to adjust pressure and flow rate. The bottom end of the reactor was connected to a liquid condenser cooled by circulating ice water by a ¼″ stainless steel tube.

A thermocouple attached to the top arm, the side arms bearing a pressure gauge and pressure relief valve and a ball valve were attached to three arms of the cross and the bottom arm was attached to the top of the stainless steel tube. The tube was wrapped with heating rope and insulation was wrapped around the heating rope. The ball valve on the bottom of the reactor is connected to a ⅛″ stainless steel tube that had provision for cooling and collecting liquid samples that could be collected via a ball valve connected to a needle valve. 0.41 g of DHAA was dissolved in 1.5 mL of hot dioxane (99.8%) and the resulting homogenic solution was immediately pipetted evenly over 4.62 g of 2% Ru-alumina catalyst pellets (Alfa-Aesar). The resulting wetted catalyst was left to air for 30 minutes and then was poured into the reactor. The reactor was sealed and purged with argon and hydrogen three times each and then hydrogen was filled to a pressure of 1010 psi. Heating was started and temperature of the catalyst bed was maintained at about 200° C. (180-207° C.) for 2.5 hours. After 0.5 h the pressure in the reactor was dropped to 720 psi and was refilled with hydrogen to 1080 psi and it was 920 psi in the end of hydrogenation. The reactor was cooled down and a sample of liquid was collected from the reactor bottom and analyzed by GC/MS. The analysis indicated formation of compounds described in Table 1 below. Tables show an analysis of products using calorific values published from literature available on the National Institute of Standards and Technology website at nist.gov. For calorific values of molecules like 2-heptanol and 4-heptanol that were not readily available an isomer's heat of combustion like the 1-heptanol isomer's calorific value was used in calculations. The GCMS peaks were matched by agilent GCMS software to the NIST 2011 library of MS spectra. The quality of matches are listed on the last column of the table. The average energy of a fuel produced from the selected products of an experiment is on the last line of the tables. GCMS qualitative analysis of higher alcohols formed is shown in Table 14 and also presents a theoretical estimation of the calorific value of a mixture. 100% of DHAA was reacted. 33% of product observed was higher alcohols and some ketones. 18% higher alcohols were formed of which 16% was heptanols.

A stream of 5% hydrogen/95% argon was passed over the catalyst at 0.5 lit/min as the catalyst was heated at 175° C. After reducing for about 18 hours overnight, the reactor was cooled and the catalyst was poured into a porcelain dish at room temperature under an argon atmosphere in a glove bag. 600 mg of DHAA was suspended in 1.2 ml of dioxane and heated with a heat gun. The hot dioxane was immediately added to the catalyst beads to wet the beads, the DHAA began to fall out of solution as the catalyst cooled. The catalyst beads were poured back into the hydrogenation reactor and it was sealed and removed from the glove bag. The reactor was then purged thrice with argon, twice with hydrogen and then filled to 1000 psi. The reactor was heated with the temperature rising to 210° C. Hydrogen was refilled as it was absorbed by the reaction and pressure varied between 900 and 1220 psi. After 2.5 hours an ice bath was placed to cool the liquid sampling tube, heating switched off and a liquid sample collected. GCMS of the sample indicated peaks for 4-heptanone, 4-heptanol, 2-heptanol and 1-butanol in a ratio of 14.2:71.4:12.6:1.5 respectively. Other products like 2,6-dimethyl-4-heptanol, n-heptane and 2,6-dimethylheptane were observed as lesser products. All DHAA starting material was consumed. GCMS qualitative analysis of higher alcohols formed is shown in Table 16 and also presents a theoretical estimation of the calorific value of a mixture. 27% of products included higher alcohols, ketone and alkane products. 23% was higher alcohols of which 21% was heptanols.

Reaction systems used (shown in FIG. 17) consisted of an upper liquid reservoir designed to melt any solid DHAA. It was made of stainless steel and fitted with a pressure transducer at the top, a tube connection to a helium cylinder to apply pressure and control flow of liquid and a tube at the bottom for liquid flow to the reactor chamber below. The reservoir was immersed in a heat bath equipped with heating oil, means for heating the bath and thermocouples to monitor the temperature. The reservoir bottom tube was a 0.02″ ID tube connected to another tube leading into the steel pipe reactor equipped with four thermocouples along its length and a pressure transducer. The top of the reactor was connected to a common line conveying liquid from the reservoir and hydrogen gas from the hydrogen supply line which had a mass flow controller and thermocouple. The bottom of the reactor was connected to a chilled condenser that condensed liquids that were drained under pressure, collected and analyzed. The uncondensed gases and vapors exited the condenser through a tube that was equipped with a back pressure regulator that was used to maintain reactor system pressure.

A thermocouple was attached to the top arm of the cross with one of the (cross) side arms bearing a pressure gauge, pressure relief valve and a ball valve. The other side arm of the ¼″ union cross was connected to a 1/16″ tube which was attached to a Gilson 307 HPLC pump. The 1/16″ tube entered the reactor and extended down till it was just above the catalyst bed. The bottom arm of the cross was attached to the top of the ½″ stainless steel tube. The tube was wrapped with heating rope and insulation was wrapped around the heating rope. Another thermocouple was placed under the heating rope. Both the thermocouples were connected to a digital display. The ball valve on the bottom of the reactor is connected to a coil of ⅛″ stainless steel tube that was connected to 2″ length of ¼ inch tube with a drain at its bottom for liquid condensate and a vent near its top that carried out non-condensing gases. This coiled tube and lower portion are cooled with ice water and served as a trap to collect liquid. The end of the gas vent had a ball valve and the liquid collecting end had a needle valve so that it could be opened slowly to collect liquid samples. 4.1 g of gamma-alumina was loaded into the reactor and three different runs were done for the ketonization. Run a) The reactor was heated to 350° C. The HPLC pump was turned on and butyric acid was pumped at a rate of 0.25 ml/min. After the reaction had run for 15 minutes liquid samples were drawn. GCMS of the samples indicated formation of 6.5% 4-heptanone with 80% butyric acid remaining indicating a conversion of about 7.5% by GCMS. Run b) The experiment was run with the flow rate of butyric acid decreased to 0.1 ml/min from 0.25 ml/min with temperature raised to 420 to 460° C. GCMS samples indicated 49% heptanone and 40% butyric acid indicating a conversion of about 55%. Run c) The experiment was run with a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min, the temperatures ranged from 410 to 460° C. Samples of the reaction were collected. GCMS analysis of the product indicated 72.5% 4-heptanone was formed and 5.4% butyric remained indicating a conversion of about 93%.

A thermocouple 6 was attached to the top arm of the cross. One of the side arms was connected to a pressure gauge 5, pressure relief valve and a ball valve to feed hydrogen to the reactor. To control the flow rate of hydrogen, the ball valve was connected via 5 foot length of fine 0.005″ id tubing 3 connected by additional flexible tubing to a pressure gauge and a hydrogen cylinder. A 1/16″ tube for liquid feed to a Gilson 307 HPLC pump was fed from a reactant reservoir. The 1/16″ tube entered the reactor and extended down until it was just above the catalyst bed. The bottom arm of the cross union was attached to the top of the ½″ stainless steel reactor tube. The tube was wrapped with heating rope and insulation was wrapped around the heating rope. Another thermocouple was placed under the heating rope. Both the thermocouples were connected to a digital display. The ball valve on the bottom of the reactor is connected to a coil of ⅛″ stainless steel tube 7 that was connected to short length of ¼ inch tube with a drain at its bottom for liquid condensate and a vent near its top that carried out non-condensing gases. This coiled tube and lower portion are cooled with ice water and served as a trap to collect liquid. The end of the gas vent coming out of the top of the trap had a back pressure valve to control reactor pressure and maintain the required flow rate of hydrogen through the reactor which was calibrated for flow rates at different pressures before the reaction. The liquid collecting vent tube coming out of the bottom of the trap had a needle valve so that it could be opened slowly to collect liquid samples. Procedure: The reactor tube was filled with about 13 g of zinc copper oxide catalyst (Unicat MTS401) and the catalyst reduced in 95:5 N2/hydrogen stream at 0.2 liters/min overnight at a temperature of 180° C. The N2/hydrogen mixture was replaced by a hydrogen line and reduction continued for another hour and then stopped. The reactor pressure was set to 300 psi hydrogen with temperature at 175° C. Hydrogen flow was at 400 cc/min and the HPLC pump was started, pumping 4-heptanone at a rate of 0.2 ml/min Reaction was continued for about 90 minutes at this flow rate as samples were taken and analyzed by GCMS indicating 83.7% heptanol and 9.2% heptanone remaining (˜90% conversion by GCMS). Flow rate of 4-heptanone was lowered to 0.15 ml/min as temperature, reactor pressure and hydrogen flow rate were in the range of 180-190° C., 300 psi and 400 cc/min respectively. GCMS at the lower flow rate indicated 77.8% 4-heptanol and 5.3% heptanone which is about 93% conversion by GC. A total of 22 grams of 4-heptanone were pumped through the reactor and 20 g of liquid product mixture was collected. Experiment 24: Synthesis of Hydrocarbons from butyric acid on larger scale-reactor setup: A reaction system (shown in FIG. 18) consisting of two steel pipes, reactor 1 (R1) and reactor 2 (R2) connected in series was built to prepare heptane, 4-heptanol, and 4-heptanone. The first reactor R1, contained catalyst to ketonize butyric acid and pass the resulting product containing heptanone to the second reactor R2 containing catalyst which reduced 4-heptanone to form 4-heptanol, heptane, etc. R1 was made of a 1″ diameter ASA schedule 40 pipe, 12 inches in length having connections for thermocouples (6,7,8,9) on its side that measured catalyst bed temperatures along with a pressure transducer (5). The top of the tube was connected to a ⅛th inch tube which fed butyric acid onto the catalyst bed. The ⅛th″ tube was connected via a 1/16th inch tube (3) to a steel bottle containing butyric acid under a pressure using differential pressure transducer (4) used to deliver butyric acid a different rates. The bottom of the tube R1 was connected via a ¼″ inch tube to R2 which was ASA schedule 40 about 13 inches in length and diameter of 1.5 inches having connections for thermocouples (14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) on its side that measured catalyst bed temperatures along with a pressure transducer (13). A hydrogen line with a 0.09″ orfice (10) connected to flow controller (11) entered R2 at the top. The bottom of R2 was connected to a trap that condensed the liquid products of the reactors and conveyed the gaseous products out to a vent. The trap was cooled by circulating chilled liquid and contained an outlet at the bottom that was connected to a ball valve and needle valve in series so that liquid samples could be drawn off slowly. The gas outlet from the trap was connected to a back pressure valve (21) so that reactor pressure could be set at 300 psi or other pressures as desired. A gas flow meter (22) was added down stream from back pressure control valve (21). Reactor R1 was filled with 80 g of gamma-alumina and R2 was filled with 570 g of copper zinc oxide catalyst (MTS-401 Unicat). The catalyst bed in R2 was heated to 180° C. and a stream of 5% hydrogen in nitrogen was passed over the catalyst for about 16 hours to reduce it. Pure hydrogen was passed for an additional hour to complete reduction. Reactions were run as butyric acid was fed into R1 at 1 ml/min and after ketonization occurred the output of R1 was fed along with hydrogen flow rates at 4 SLPM through R2. Reactor pressure was at around 300 psi and temperature was raised. Samples of the reaction were drawn and analyzed by GCMS. Five experiments were run with typically more than 25 samples for each run. Thus more than 125 samples were taken. For instance, data from run 3 was charted in graph 2 below showing product composition of samples as the temperature changed and experiment progressed over time. Table 28 shows an example of deeper analysis of data points from graph 4 for sample 30 taken at around 15:14 on the x-axis. GCMS qualitative analysis shows the important compounds found in sample 30 listed along with their percentage. 100% of starting materials were converted. Product mixture shows above 95% hydrocarbons of which 72.5% is heptane and minor ketone products. Table 29 lists experimental calorific values of samples from different runs. Table 30 shows a theoretical energy calculation for the same sample 30 based on GCMS qualitative analysis. The table shows distribution of classes of compounds in the sample such as alcohols (such as 1-butanol, 4-heptanol, etc), ketones (such as 4-heptanone), alkanes (such as heptane, nonane, etc).

The feed stream of propanoic anhydride vapor was generated by addition of the anhydride from the dropping funnel 1 into the hot round bottom flask 2 immersed in an oil bath 3. The resulting vapor was passed to the top of a vertical hollow quartz tube 4 47 cm long and with an internal diameter of 22 mm. At the lower part of the quartz tube (5 cm from the bottom) was placed a removable silica foam monolith disk 6 with porosity 45 pores per inch, 20 mm diameter and 10 mm thickness. The disk was supported inside of the reactor by a built-in quartz frit and temperature of the disk was measured with an external thermocouple placed in a glass pocket located under the frit. The quartz tube was placed in a cylindrical furnace 5 where the temperature was controlled with a PID controller 7. The gaseous products produced from the quartz tube were passed through a reflux condenser 8 with cold water (5° C.) to separate the formed methylketene from propanoic acid and anhydride which were collected by a graduated cylinder 9 attached at the bottom receiver for liquid condensate. The top of the reflux condenser was connected to the Dewar condenser 10 equipped with a round bottom flask 11, immersed in a Dewar flask 12. The flask was connected to the second Dewar condenser 13 also equipped with a round bottom flask 14 and immersed in a Dewar flask 15. The flask 14 was connect to the empty bubbler 16 which was attached to a vacuum pump 17 with the outlet tube placed into the hood's exhausting vent. The furnace temperature was set to 650° C. and temperature of the silica foam disk 6 in the reactor was kept at 550-580° C. The dropping funnel was charged with 100 mL of propionic anhydride and the vacuum pump was turned on to maintain ˜80 mbar pressure in the reactor system. The first Dewar condenser 10 and Dewar flask 12 were filled with liquid nitrogen and then the anhydride was added at rate of ˜0.8 ml/min to the flask 2 immersed in an oil bath heated at 180-200° C. The process was continued for 2 h and the product was collected in the flask 11. After the process was stopped, the connection between the first Dewar condenser 10 and a reflux condenser 8 was blocked (by pinching a connecting tubing) and the second Dewar condenser 13 and Dewar flask 15 were filled up with liquid nitrogen. Dewar flask 12 was removed and the round bottom flask 11 with attached Dewar condenser 10 was slowly warmed up to room temperature to distill part of the collected methylketene into the second Dewar condenser 13 and round bottom flask 14. After 1 h the connection between flask 11 and Dewar condenser 13 was blocked and the flask was disconnected and protected with a balloon filled with nitrogen and left overnight. The bubbler 16 was filled with 50 ml of acetone including a few drops of triethylamine. The second Dewar flask 15 was removed and the round bottom flask 14 with attached Dewar condenser 13 was slowly warmed up to room temperature. After 1 h the flask 14 was disconnected, protected with a balloon filled with nitrogen and left overnight. In the flask 11 was obtained 10 g of the yellow liquid including: 10.4% of methylketene dimer, 51.4% of methylketene trimer, 5.0% propionic acid and 7.4% of propionic acid anhydride (Mixture A). In the flask 14 was obtained 4 g of the yellow liquid including 8.6% of methylketene dimer, 69.5% of methylketene trimer and 7.9% of propionic acid anhydride (Mixture B). The acetone solution in the bubbler 16 showed the presence of triethylamine and only traces of methylketene dimer and propionic anhydride. Experiment 26: Hydrogenation of methylketene dimer and trimer over a copper-zinc catalyst: The reduction reaction was performed in a hydrogenation reactor (FIG. 14) (made from Swagelok parts using the required unions, port connectors, reducers and valves as needed) consisting of a ½″ diameter stainless steel tube reactor wrapped in heat tape and insulation fitted with a ball valve at the bottom and a cross on the top. A thermocouple 6 was attached to the top arm of the cross. One of the side arms was connected to a pressure gauge 5, pressure relief valve and a ball valve to feed hydrogen to the reactor. To control the flow rate of hydrogen, the ball valve was connected via 5 foot length of fine 0.005″ id tubing 3 connected by additional flexible tubing to a pressure gauge and a hydrogen cylinder. A 1/16″ tube for liquid feed to a Gilson 307 HPLC pump was fed from a reactant reservoir. The 1/16″ tube entered the reactor and extended down till it was just above the catalyst bed. The bottom arm of the cross union was attached to the top of the ½″ stainless steel reactor tube. The tube was wrapped with heating rope and insulation was wrapped around the heating rope. Another thermocouple was placed under the heating rope. Both the thermocouples were connected to a digital display. The ball valve on the bottom of the reactor is connected to a coil of ⅛″ stainless steel tube 7 that was connected to short length of ¼ inch tube with a drain at its bottom for liquid condensate and a vent near its top that carried out non-condensing gases. This coiled tube and lower portion are cooled with ice water and served as a trap to collect liquid. The end of the gas vent coming out of the top of the trap had a back pressure valve to control reactor pressure and maintain the required flow rate of hydrogen through the reactor which was calibrated for flow rates at different pressures before the reaction. The liquid collecting vent tube coming out of the bottom of the trap had a needle valve so that it could be opened slowly to collect liquid samples. Procedure: The reactor tube was filled with 8.9 g of copper zinc oxide catalyst (Unicat MTS401) and the catalyst was reduced in 95:5 N2/hydrogen stream at 0.2 liters/min at a temperature of 160° C. for 18 h. The N2/hydrogen mixture was replaced by a hydrogen line and reduction was continued for another hour at 0.4 liters/min at 200° C. Then the reactor pressure was set to 300 psi hydrogen with temperature at 183° C. and hydrogen flow at 400 cc/min The HPLC pump was turned on and the Mixture A (from the methyl ketene reaction above) was pumped into the reactor at rate of 0.05 ml/min. After 30 min hydrogen flow rate was increased to 660 cc/min and temperature of the reactor to 211° C. and the liquid samples were collected. GCMS analysis for product taken over duration of reaction indicated formation of 2-methylpentanol, 3-pentanol, pentanone, as two major products of the hydrogenation along with 3-pentanone (6%) and other higher alcohols presented in smaller amounts. GCMS qualitative analysis of higher alcohols formed is shown in Table 31. 100% of the methyl ketene dimer/trimer mixture was reduced. 43-50% higher alcohol product was formed of which 16-27% was 3-pentanola and 19-28% was 2-methyl pentanol.

In the liquid reservoir was placed 292 g (300 ml) of propanoic acid. In the reactor 1 (ketonization step) was placed 220 g of gamma-alumina (bed of diameter 1.6″ and length 13.0″) and in the reactor 2 (reduction step) was placed 570 g copper-zinc oxide catalyst (bed of diameter 1.6″ and length 12.4″). Temperature of the reactors 1 and 2 was set at 400° C. and 200° C., respectively, heating begun and the reactor system was pressurized with hydrogen at 300 psi. The reaction was started and flow of propanoic acid was at about 1.0 ml/min. Hydrogen flow was at 4.8 SLPM and reactor pressure at 300 psia hydrogen. The ketonization reactor 1 maximum temperature was at 402° C. and average over its entire length was about 360° C. The hydrogenation reactor 2 maximum temperature was 233° C. and average temperature was 220° C. over its entire length. Product of the reaction was analyzed on a GCMS indicating a mixture with 65% 3-pentanol including other C4-8 alcohols with about 72% alcohols. Other products were 13% C7-14 aromatics and about 4% pentanone. GCMS qualitative analysis of products formed is shown in Table 32 and also presents a theoretical estimation of the calorific value of a mixture.

The latter two systems are employed to recover catalyst solutions, methyl iodide and methyl acetate and separate product acetic acid. The carbonylation reactor consists of a stirred autoclave within which the reacting liquid contents are maintained at constant level of approximately 1800 ml with contents analyzed periodically. Into this reactor are fed methanol, sufficient water and recycled catalyst solution from the flasher and recycled methyl acetate and methyl iodide from the acetic acid methyl iodide splitter column. The composition of the reaction medium is maintained such that there is 13-16% methyl iodide, 4-5 wt. % methyl acetate, 19-19.5 wt. % lithium iodide, 4-5 wt. % water, and 310 to 335 ppm rhodium with the balance of the composition acetic acid which is drawn off as it formed. CO gas containing some hydrogen with a partial pressure of about 20 psi is fed continuously to the system as the mixture is agitated for thorough mixing of gases as reactor pressure is kept at 28 atmospheres with reactor temperature at 189-191° C. Reaction medium is distilled out and acetic acid separated to yield about 14 gram moles of acetic acid/hr/lit of reaction medium. See Torrence et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,608. Direct Conversion of Methanol to Ethanol: The autoclave is charged with 0.52 g of rhodium dicarbonyl acetylacetonate, Rh(CO2)acac, (2 mmol), 0.82 g of ruthenium trichloride hydrate, 0.82 g of 1,3bis (diphenylphosphino)propane (2 mmol), 2.5 mL of methyl iodide (40.1 mmol) and 40 mL of methanol. The reactor contents are then heated to 140° C. and the pressure adjusted to 1,000 psig using a H2:CO mixture having a 2:1 mole ratio. The reaction is continued for 2.75 hours at 975±25 psig and stopped, during which period 3,350 psig of synthesis gas is consumed. The reactor is then cooled and recovered. Analysis of the recovered liquid product indicates formation and presence of about 27.5% ethanol, 10.1% acetaldehyde, 10.2% ethyl acetate, 11.5% methyl acetate, 2.5% acetic acid, 0.5% dimethyl acetal, 1.7% diethyl ether, 11.9% dimethyl ether 17.5% methanol and 2.9% methyl iodide. See Wegman et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,727,200. Carbonylation of Ethanol: The catalyst, RhCl3.3H2O at conc. of 7.63×10−6 mol cm−3, ethanol at conc. of 0.69×10−2 mol cm−3 and hydroiodic acid at concentration of 0.11×10−2 mol are dissolved in water. The solution is then charged into the reactor, flushed with carbon monoxide and the contents heated to 200° C. temperature within ten minutes. The reactor is pressurized with 2-3 atm of carbon monoxide and the reaction was started by switching on the stirrer. Pressure in the reactor was maintained using a constant pressure regulator between the reactor and the gas reservoir. The progress of the reaction was followed by observing the pressure drop in the reservoir as a function of time. The liquid samples were taken periodically and also analyzed by GC. After absorption 0.7 moles of CO, an analysis of a liquid phase showed a complete consumption of ethanol and formation of propionic acid with 99% selectivity at about 0.7×10−2 mol/cm−3 concentration.
