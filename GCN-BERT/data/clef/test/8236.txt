Preparation of compound 7-b.
Compound 7-c (0.84 g, 3 mmol), compound 1-f (1.0 g, 3 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.78 g, 6 mmol) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (100 mL). And the reaction mixture was stirred at 40°C for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was added to 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (2 mL), and then extracted with dichloromethane (5 mL × 3). The combined organic phases were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to deliver a yellow solid 7-b (1.3 g, yield: 79%). This product was used without further purification.
