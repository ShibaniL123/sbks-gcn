A mixture of 4,4'-((2,2-bis(bromomethyl)propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy))dibenzonitrile (2.80 g, 4.7 mmol, a side product from preparation of Compound T4), 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenol (0.91 mL, 6 mmol), potassium carbonate (1.38 g, 10 mmol), and DMF (20 mL) was stirred under argon and heated at 110Â° C. for 20 h. The reaction mixture was poured into ice/water (200 mL), neutralized with 3N HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate/toluene (1:1, 300 mL). The extract was washed with water (200 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and the volatiles were removed off under reduced pressure. The residue was chromatographed (silica gel, hexane/ethyl acetate, 8:2) to give Compound T5, 4,4'-((2-((3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)methyl)-2-(bromomethyl)-propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy)dibenzonitrile, (2.16 g, 75% yield).
