PRIORITY CLAIM This application claims priority to Australian provisional patent application 2012900346 filed on 31 Jan. 2012, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD The present disclosure relates to a fluorescent composition, use of a fluorescent composition, and to objects, kits and combinations products comprising a fluorescent composition. BACKGROUND There are many situations where it may be desirable to mark a product with a fluorescent agent. For example, the decorative appeal of some products is improved if all or part of the product can fluoresce under appropriate light conditions. Examples of such products include novelty items and ornamental organisms, such as plants and flowers. In other circumstances, it may be desirable to mark a product with a fluorescent agent, for example so as to tag or identify the product. For example, products may be marked with a fluorescent agent so that the product fluoresces with a selected wavelength upon irradiation with light of a wavelength able to excite the fluorophore, thereby allowing identification of the product. In circumstances where a fluorescent agent is added to a product so as to mark the product, the selection of the fluorescent properties of the fluorescent agent is an important consideration. For example, the excitation and emission characteristics of the fluorescent agent need to be matched with the properties of the product and its desired use. The selection of the vehicle used in conjunction with the fluorescent agent may also be an important consideration. The selection of the vehicle is particularly important in relation to the required means of application/introduction and/or the properties of the fluorescent agent. For example, if the agent is to be applied by way of spray application, the properties of the liquid vehicle are important in relation to droplet size produced upon spraying. In circumstances where a product is marked by application of a fluorescent agent to a surface of product, another important consideration is the properties of the surface of the product to which the fluorescent agent is to be applied. For example, some surfaces are inherently difficult to mark. This is particularly the case for surfaces that are predominantly hydrophobic or hydrophilic. The wettability of surfaces also varies greatly. Accordingly, there is a need to provide marking compositions that address one or more problems in the art and/or provide one or more advantages in the art.

Example 1 Fluorescent Agents Different types of fluorophores were tested to see the effect on flowers and to observe the fluorescence emitted when on the flowers. The following fluorophores were tested at the following concentrations: Xanthene based fluorophores: (i) 0.5% (w/v) Eosin Y (ii) 0.5% (w/v) Rhodamine 6G; (iii) 0.5% (w/v) Fluorescein; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon based Fluorophores: (i) 0.05% (w/v) 8-Hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (also known as Pyranine (an arylsulphonate flurophore) or “Solvent Green”). The above solutions were prepared by adding the fluorophore to tap water, in order to test the properties of the fluorophores in a non-sterilised, non-purified aqueous solution. The solutions were placed into a spray device for application to the surface of the relevant plants. Solutions were sprayed onto chrysanthemums and roses and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. Solutions of Xanthene based fluorophores (Eosin Y, Fluorescein and Rhodamine 6G) were rejected, since these solutions caused wilting of flowers and reduced vase life. A solution of 0.05% (w/v) Fluorescent brightener 28 (also known as Calcofluor White M2R) was also tested. Fluorescent brightener 28 was rejected since it emitted blue fluorescent light which was not very effective, when excited by UVA light. It was found that 0.05% (w/v) pyranine did not affect the vase life of flower and provided a bright green fluorescence, when excited by UVA light. It was concluded that fluorophores providing a strong emission in the green light spectrum were effective. It was further concluded that Xanthene-based fluorophores promoted wilting and reduced vase life, while polycyclic aromatic fluorophores (typified by pyranine) did not promote wilting and/or reduce vase life. Example 2 Pyranine Emission is pH Dependent Flowers were sprayed with 0.05% (w/v) pyranine solution at a pH of 7.0. The liquid was allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. Another solution containing 0.05% (w/v) pyranine was prepared and the pH of the solution altered to 3.0 using acetic acid solution. This solution was also sprayed on the flowers and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. It was observed that flowers sprayed with 0.05% (w/v) pyranine (pH of 7.0) emitted fluorescent green spots when excited by UVA light, while 0.05% (w/v) pyranine at pH 3.0 emitted a fluorescent blue colour, when excited by UV light. The pH of the solution was therefore found to affect the colour of the fluorescence emitted, when excited by UVA light. This result further demonstrated the ability of pyranine as a fluorophore whose fluorescence colour can be altered and maintained when sprayed onto a surface by alteration of pH. Example 3 Effect of a Polyethylene Glycol on Fluorescence To determine whether a polyethylene glycol may enhance fluorescence of a fluorophore, the effect of polyethylene glycol 1500 was tested on fluorescein applied to flowers. Polyethylene glycol at concentrations of 0.3% (w/v), 0.5% (w/v), 1% (w/v), 2% (w/v) concentration was tested. It was observed that the pH of the solution was lowered to 3.36-2.64 when 0.3% (w/v) to 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500 was added to the solution. Flowers were sprayed with the solution containing the respective concentrations of polyethylene glycol 1500 and allowed to dry overnight. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. It was found that all flowers sprayed with the fluorophore solution containing polyethylene glycol emitted blue colour fluorescence, while the flowers sprayed with only the fluorophore solution emitted a green fluorescence when excited by UV light. Example 4 Altering pH with Acetic Acid as Compared to Citric Acid Lemon juice (a source of citric acid) and vinegar (a source of acetic acid) were added to the fluorophore solution to decrease the pH of the solution so as to obtain blue fluorescence. The effect of lemon juice and vinegar was compared with each other. A solution containing 0.1% (w/v) of pyranine was prepared and lemon juice was added to adjust the pH of the solution to 3.0. A similar fluorophore solution, containing 0.1% (w/v) of pyranine was prepared and the pH of the solution was also adjusted to 3.0. The solutions were sprayed on individual flowers and were allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. Flowers sprayed with fluorophore solution containing lemon juice and flowers sprayed with fluorophore solution containing vinegar emitted blue fluorescent spots, when excited by UV light. It was observed that the colour of the fluorescent spots, on flowers sprayed with fluorophore solution containing vinegar, changed back to a green colour after 2 days. This effect may be attributable to acetic acid vaporising with time, hence altering the pH of the fluorophore and changing the colour of the fluorescence emitted. Example 5 Concentration of Pyranine The effect of different pyranine concentrations was tested to determine the relationship between concentration and fluorescence, and to determine if a higher concentration of the fluorophore affected the vase life of the flower. Concentrations of 0.05% (w/v), 0.1% (w/v), 0.2% (w/v) and 0.5% (w/v) pyranine were tested. Solutions were prepared with the respective concentrations of fluorophore using tap water. The solutions were applied on individual flowers and were allowed to dry overnight. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. The amount of fluorescence emitted by the flowers sprayed with various concentrations of pyranine solutions appeared to fade with increasing concentration of pyranine when excited by UV light. It was observed that with 0.2% (w/v) and 0.5% (w/v) concentration of pyranine the colour of the droplets turned from fluorescent green to non-fluorescent yellow. It was also found that the various concentrations of pyranine did not affect vase life. Hence, 0.1% (w/v) of pyranine was therefore selected as a suitable concentration for all future experiments. Example 6 Effect of Sealants Different sealants were tested to see if they would preserve the fluorophore on the flower and to test whether they prevented the fluorophore from being rubbed away. Chrysal Professional Glory and Pokon Leaf Shine were tested for this purpose. Flowers were sprayed with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution and allowed to dry for 2 hours at room temperature. It was then sprayed with Chrysal Professional Glory and allowed to dry for 2 hours. Another bunch of flowers was sprayed with the pyranine solution, and after drying Leaf Shine spray applied. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. In both cases, the flower wilted and the vase-life of the flower was found to be reduced drastically. In both cases the fluorophore rubbed off on the hand and it did not preserve the fluorophore, hence both products were not considered further. In a further experiment, the ability to protect the fluorophore from being rubbed off was tested by making up pyranine with Chrysal Professional Glory solution. The solution from Chrysal Professional Glory was mixed with pyranine to give a 0.1% (w/v) solution. This solution was sprayed on the flowers and was allowed to dry overnight. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. The colour of the fluorescence emitted by the fluorophore was yellowish green, when excited by UV light. The fluorophore rubbed off on the hand and was not preserved on the flower. Hence Chrysal Professional Glory was not used further. Example 7 pH Dependence of Pyranine Fluorescence To further investigate the pH dependence of pyranine fluorescence, the various colours emitted by the fluorophore was tested by altering the pH of the solution using lemon juice (a source of citric acid). The solution was made with 0.1% pyranine (w/v), 5% (w/v) sugar and the pH of the solution was altered from 6.84 to 6.00, 4.95, 4.46, 4.01, 3.69, 3.48, 3.01 using lemon juice. The fluorophore solutions with the different pH was made and sprayed onto flowers, which were allowed to dry overnight. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. Fluorescent Green spots were observed between a pH of 6.84 to 4.46 and fluorescent blue spots were observed between a pH of 4.46 to 3.01, when excited by UV light. FIG. 1A shows flowers sprayed with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution at a pH of 3.0 adjusted, when excited by UV light. FIG. 1B shows flowers sprayed with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution at a pH of 6.84, when excited by UV light. Example 8 Effect of Time of UV Exposure The effect of long term exposure of UV light was tested on flowers sprayed with fluorophore Flowers were sprayed with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution. The flowers were allowed to dry overnight. A UV torch Optimax™ 365, having an intensity of 50,000 μW/cm2 was shone on the sprayed flowers. It was observed for 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours. There was no visible change in the colour of fluorescence emitted on the flowers even after 6 hours of continuous UV exposure. Hence it was concluded that the fluorescence emitted by the pyranine 0.1% (w/v) solution sprayed on the flower is consistent even after long hours of UV exposure. Example 9 Effect of Sugars on Droplet Formation The effect of different types of sugar on the droplet formation of the pyranine fluorophore when sprayed on the flowers was tested. A pyranine solution at 0.1% (w/v) was prepared with 5% sucrose. In addition, a 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution with 5% glucose was also prepared. The solutions were sprayed onto flowers and allowed to dry overnight. A 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution was also prepared where no sugar was added. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. It was observed that 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution with 5% sucrose gave mist-like droplet formation, where the fluorescent green droplet is distributed all over the petal, as seen when excited by UV light. Glucose gave a similar type of mist like fluorescent green droplet distribution. With no sugar, the fluorophore spread throughout the surface of petal of the flower and did not form fine droplets, in part due to the petal of the flower being waxy and no sugar in solution to induce droplet formation of the pyranine fluorophore. These and other studies demonstrate that the concentration of the sugar (eg sucrose) needs to be varied with different substrates and/or fluorophores, depending on one or more of the solubility of the fluorophore, the physical texture (in particular the hydrophobicity) of the surface on to which the formulation is being sprayed, the droplet size, maintenance of the fluorophore in dispersion or solution, and the brightness of the formulation. Example 10 Calcium Chloride as a Substitute for a Sugar It was found that sugar in the fluorophore solution caused an increase in growth of bacteria and fungus. Calcium chloride was tested to check if it has hygroscopic properties and could replace sugar, hence eliminating the microbial growth. A pyranine solution at 0.1% (w/v) solution was prepared with a concentration of 5 mM calcium chloride. This was sprayed on flowers and allowed to dry overnight. A control solution containing only 0.1% (w/v) pyranine alone was prepared and sprayed on flowers and allowed to dry overnight. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. Flowers sprayed with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution with 5 mM calcium chloride did not exhibit any hygroscopic properties and also spread over the surface of the petal. The mist-like fluorescent spot formation was also not present on the petal of the flower as observed in the flower sprayed with the control solution, when observed under UV light. Example 11 Fixatives Different sealants were tested to preserve the fluorophore on flowers and to prevent the fluorophore from being rubbed away. Ironing Aid Starch (Coles Smart Buy), White Knight Crystal Clear Acrylic (White Knight) and Fixative Workable Mat (Micador) were tested for this purpose. Flowers were pre-sprayed with Ironing Aid Starch, White knight Crystal Clear Acrylic and Fixative Workable Mat (on different flowers) and allowed to dry for an hour. All flowers were then sprayed with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine containing 5% (w/v) sugar and allowed to dry overnight. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. Flowers pre-sprayed with Fixative Workable Mat and 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution containing 5% (w/v) sugar emitted fluorescent blue spots, when excited by UV light. In addition, this did not prevent fluorophore rubbing, hence the Fixative Workable Mat was not considered ideal for this purpose. Flowers pre-sprayed with honing Aid Atarch and 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution containing 5% (w/v) sugar showed an increase in the size of the droplets formed and did not give mist-like spot formation. In addition, the spray did not preserve the fluorophore on the petal hence it was not considered further. Flowers pre-sprayed with White Knight Crystal Clear Acrylic solution and 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution containing 5% (w/v) sugar caused the wilting of the flower and affected the vase-life of the flower. Furthermore it did not preserve the fluorophore on the flower and the fluorophore rubbed off. Hence this was not considered further Different sealants were also tested to preserve the fluorophore on the flower and to prevent the fluorophore from being rubbed away. Ironing Aid Starch, White Knight Crystal Clear Acrylic and Fixative Workable Mat were tested for this purpose Flowers were pre-sprayed with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine containing 5% (w/v) sugar and allowed to dry for an hour. These flowers were then post sprayed with Ironing Aid Starch, White Knight Crystal Clear Acrylic and Fixative Workable Mat, where each spray went on different flowers sprayed with the fluorophore. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. Flowers post sprayed with Ironing Aid Starch did not upset the mist-like fluorescent green droplet formation when excited by UV light; however it did not preserve the fluorophore on the flower. The fluorophore rubbed off on the hand, hence this spray was not considered. Flowers post sprayed with White Knight Crystal Clear Acrylic showed wilting of the flower and reduced vase life of the flower. The fluorophore again was not preserved using this spray and rubbed off on the hand and was hence not further used. Flowers post-sprayed with Fixative Workable Mat did not upset the mist-like fluorescent green droplet formation; however it did not prevent the fluorophore from being rubbed off from the flower. Hence this spray was not further used. Flowers were also sprayed with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution and immediately sprayed with Ironing Aid Starch solution. This was allowed to dry overnight and observed the next day. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. The fluorophore was not preserved on the flower even after it was sprayed with Ironing Aid Starch solution. The fluorophore rubbed off on the hand; hence this was not used further. Example 12 Effect of Sugar Concentration The amount of sugar in the fluorophore solution promoted the formation of bacteria and fungus and also caused the fluorophore solution to be sticky. Hence the effect of lower concentrations of sugar was tested, in order to determine the concentrations at which mist like droplet formation of the fluorophore solution was retained. 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution was prepared with 5% (w/v), 1% (w/v), 0.5% (w/v), and 0.1% (w/v) sugar. 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution with no sugar was also prepared and used as control solution. The different solutions were sprayed on flowers and were allowed to dry overnight. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor vase life. It was observed that 0.5% (w/v) sugar gave a similar mist-like fluorescent green droplet formation as compared to the fluorophores solution with 1% (w/v) and 5% (w/v) sugar, when excited by UV light. The control solution with no sugar and the 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution with 0.1% (w/v) sugar did not form mist-like fluorescent green droplets and the fluorophore spread through-out the surface of the flower, when observed under UV light. The amount of stickiness in the fluorophore solution with 0.5% (w/v) sugar was considerably reduced as compared to 5% (w/v) sugar. Hence 0.5% (w/v) sugar was used in all the future experiments. Example 13 Use of Polymers and Sealants Present in Hair Spray Hair spray (Taft) was tested to check if it could preserve the fluorophore on the flower and prevent it from being rubbed off. Flowers were sprayed with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution with 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and allowed to dry for three hours. The flowers were then sprayed with hair spray and allowed to dry for four hours. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment in order to determine vase life. The hair spray was found to cause the fluorophore to emit fluorescent blue colour, when excited by UV light. It furthermore did not prevent the rubbing of the fluorophore from the hand. Hence the hair spray was not used in future experiments Example 14 Use of PVA as a Sealant Poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) was also investigated to determine if it prevented the rubbing of the fluorophore from the flower. Fluorophore solution was prepared with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose and with varying concentrations of PVA: 1% (w/v), 0.5% (w/v) and 0.1% (w/v). Fluorophore solution with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine and 0.5% (w/v) sucrose was used as a control solution. The various solutions were prepared and sprayed on flowers and allowed to dry overnight. Lilies, carnations and chrysanthemums were used in this experiment. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. The fluorophore solution with 1% (w/v), 0.5% (w/v) and 0.1% (w/v) of PVA did not prevent the rubbing off of the fluorophore on all three different varieties of flowers. The amount of fluorophore that rubbed off from flowers with sturdy petal (carnations) was less compared to those flowers with fragile petals (lilies). Example 15 Use of Artist's Fixative as a Sealant Artist Fixative (Winsor and Newton) was tested to check if the fluorophore could be preserved on the flower and could prevent the rubbing off of the fluorophore. Flowers were sprayed with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine solution with 0.5% (w/v) sugar. This was immediately sprayed with Artist Fixative and allowed to dry for two hours. This experiment was performed on roses, carnations and chrysanthemums. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. It was observed that the fluorophore did not rub off when it was rubbed gently as seen in all three varieties of flowers. The fluorophore, however rubbed off if the petals were rubbed harshly, as seen in all three variety of flowers. Example 16 Use of Bicarbonate to Maintain pH Pyranine was found to emit a fluorescent green solution at a higher pH when excited with UV light. Sodium bicarbonate was observed to increase the pH of the solution. Sodium bicarbonates was added to pyranine solution to maintain a higher pH so as to ensure that the fluorescence emitted from the flower remains green. Fluorophore solution was prepared with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sugar and 0.1% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate. This was sprayed on flowers and allowed to dry overnight. A positive control with only 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sugar and without sodium bicarbonate was also tested. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor vase life. The flowers sprayed with the fluorophore solution containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate gave green coloured fluorescence when excited with UV-light. This was similar to the positive control and it did not affect the vase-life of the flower. Hence it was used further in all other experiments. Example 17 Fluorescence is Stable after Application of an Acidic Solution It was observed from previous experiments that a shift in pH when excited with UV light caused the colour of the fluorescence emitted from the fluorophore sprayed on the flowers to change. Flowers were sprayed with a solution which had a pH of 7.72 and later sprayed with dilute HCl solution to observe any change. Flowers sprayed with a solution containing 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sugar and 0.1% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate which had a pH of 7.72. This was allowed to dry overnight. The flowers were then sprayed with 1 mM HCl, 1.5 mM HCl and 2 mM HCl solution. A set of control flowers was observed where they were only sprayed with the fluorophore and not sprayed with dilute HCl solution. The fluorescence emitted by the flowers sprayed with the fluorophore on the first day was green when excited by UV light. However there was no change in colour to fluorescent blue when sprayed with dilute 1 mM HCl, 1.5 mM HCl and 2 mM HCl solution, as observed under UV light. The flowers emitted green fluorescence even after being sprayed with dilute HCl solution, when excited by UV light. Hence this experiment was not further considered. Example 18 Use of Methyl Paraben as an Anti-Microbial Agent The pyranine solution containing sugar enhanced the growth of bacteria and fungus; hence an anti-microbial agent, methyl paraben, was tested on the flowers. The fluorophore solution was made up with 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sugar and 0.1% (w/v) of methylparaben, in 10% (v/v) ethanol. This was sprayed on flowers and allowed to dry overnight. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor vase life. The fluorescent green colour emitted by the fluorophore was preserved when excited by UV light, however the solution caused wilting of the flowers and reduced the vase-life of the flower, hence this additive was not considered. Example 19 Effect of Different Sugars The effectiveness of different type of sugars on the droplet formation of the fluorophore solution was tested. Sucrose, glucose, fructose and mannitol were used for this purpose. Fluorophore solution containing 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.1% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate and 0.5% (w/v) of sucrose were prepared. Similar fluorophore solutions were prepared with the different sugar, namely glucose, fructose or mannitol. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. Sucrose and fructose gave similar results with mist-like droplet formation all over the flower. Green fluorescence was emitted from the fluorophore in both cases, when excited by UV light. With glucose, the amount of fluorophore sticking onto the surface of the petal decreased. Similar green fluorescence was observed even in the case of glucose, when excited by UV light. With mannitol, there was an increase in the size of droplet formation, although the fluorophore emitted a fluorescent green colour, when excited by UV light. Sucrose was used for all future experiments. Example 20 Sterilisation of Sugar Solutions Fluorophore solution containing sugar caused the increase in growth of bacteria and fungus. Hence, the fluorophore solutions were autoclaved and the effect of autoclaving on droplet formation and vase-life of the cut flower were tested. Fluorophore solution was prepared containing 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate. A similar solution was prepared with the same concentration of fructose. A small quantity of both the solutions prepared was kept aside for future use. Both the solutions were autoclaved at 121° C. in an Atherton Squirrel autoclave. This was then allowed to cool to room temperature and sprayed on flowers. Solutions which were kept aside previously (and which were not auto-claved) were also sprayed onto flowers. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor vase life. The fluorophore solution containing fructose appeared dark brown after it was autoclaved, whereas the fluorophore solution containing sucrose appeared to be fluorescent green. When the autoclaved fluorophore solution containing sucrose was sprayed on flowers, the droplets appeared to be bigger and the droplets had a slightly yellow appearance when excited by UV-light. A similar effect was observed when the autoclaved fluorophore solution containing fructose was sprayed on flowers. The vase life of the flower was not affected by the autoclaved solution. Example 21 Preservatives Bacterial and fungal growth was observed in the fluorophore solution containing sugar. Hence the preservatives, sodium benzoate and diazolidinyl urea were tested. The fluorophore solution prepared contained 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1%(w/v) sodium benzoate. The solution to test the effect of diazolidinyl urea contained 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1%(w/v) diazolidinyl urea. Fluorophore solution containing only 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate was prepared and used as positive control. All the solutions were sprayed on lilly chrysanthemums and allowed to dry overnight. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. A very strong smell was given by the fluorophore solution containing diazolidinyl urea, when it was being prepared. The flowers which were sprayed with the fluorophore solution which contained diazolidinyl urea, when excited by a UV light gave fluorescent green droplets. The droplet formation was similar to that of the positive control. The flowers which were sprayed with the fluorophore solution which contained sodium benzoate, gave fluorescent green droplets when excited by UV light. The vase life of the flowers was not affected when they were sprayed with fluorophore solution which contained diazolidinyl urea or sodium benzoate. Hence 0.1% (w/v) sodium benzoate was used in further experiments. Example 23 Sugar Concentration The effect of sugar concentration was further tested with the components sodium benzoate and sodium bicarbonate in the fluorophore solution. The fluorophore solution prepared contained 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate and 0.1% (w/v) sodium benzoate. Fluorophore solution with a higher concentration of sugar 1% (w/v) sugar, 1.5% (w/v) sugar, 2% (w/v) sugar was also prepared and tested. The different solutions were sprayed on gerberas and allowed to dry overnight. A negative control with no spray was also used to monitor the experiment to determine vase life. When the flowers sprayed with fluorophore solution with 0.5% (w/v) sucrose was compared with flowers sprayed with fluorophore solution containing 1% (w/v) sugar, 1.5% (w/v) sugar, 2% (w/v) sugar, it was observed that the flowers sprayed with 2% (w/v) sugar gave more droplets, as observed under the UV-lights. The amount of droplets sticking on to the petals of the flower increased with increasing concentration of the sugar in the fluorophore solution. However the flower sprayed with fluorophore solution containing 2% (w/v) sugar was extremely sticky when touched by hand due to the high sugar concentration. This was not observed in flowers sprayed with fluorophore containing 1.5% (w/v) sugar, 1% (w/v) sugar, and 0.5% (w/v) sugar. Hence fluorophore solution with 1.5% (w/v) sugar was used in further experiments. The vase life of the flowers were not affected by the high concentration of sugar. Example 24 Uptake of Fluorophore Freshly cut stems of flowers (roses and chrysanthemums) were prepared and the ends of the stems placed in a solution of 0.1% (w/v) pyranine, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose. The cut end of the flowers was left in the solution overnight and uptake of the fluorophore viewed under UVA light. FIG. 3 shows uptake of the fluorophore in a rose flower. The veins in the petals of the flower demonstrate fluorescence. The fluorophore is moved to the flowers, through the stem, in the transpiration stream. FIGS. 4 and 5 shows uptake of the fluorophore in a chrysanthemum flower. The veins in the petals of the flower demonstrate fluorescence. Once again, the fluorophore is moved to the flowers, through the stem, in the transpiration stream.
