The urethane resin used as a film for providing the coated granular material of the present invention is a urethane resin obtained by reaction of an aromatic diisocyanate with a polyol mixture comprising a polyesterpolyol and a C2-C8 polymethylene glycol. The molar ratio of the polyesterpolyol to the polymethylene glycol is 1:20 to 20:1. The polyesterpolyol is preferably a polyesterpolyol having 15 wt % or more of an oxycarbonyl structure (—O—C(═O)—) part in the molecule. The polyesterpolyol is generally polylactonepolyol, which means a compound produced by ring-opening-polymerizing a lactone monomer with a low molecular weight polyol. Examples of the lactone monomer include β-propiolactone, γ-butyrolactone, δ-valerolactone and ε-caprolactone. Examples of the low molecular weight polyol include divalent alcohol such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol and 1,8-octanediol; and trivalent alcohol such as 2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol(trimethylolpropane), 2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol, glycerin and triethanolamine. Preferable polyesterpolyol is polycaprolactonepolyol, which is a compound produced by ring-opening-polymerizing an ε-caprolactone monomer with the above-mentioned low molecular weight polyol. Typical chemical structures of the polycaprolactonepolyol(polycaprolactonediol or polycaprolactonetriol) having two or three hydroxyl groups in one molecule are shown below. This polycaprolactonepolyol is a polyol having at least one (1-oxohexa-1,6-diyl)oxy structure (—C(═O)—CH2—CH2—CH2—CH2—CH2—O—) in one molecule. [wherein, m represents an integer of 0 or more, n represents an integer of 1 or more and m+n is 2 or more, and R1 represents a divalent organic group (for example, ethylene group, tetramethylene group and the like)]. [wherein, m and p represent an integer of 0 or more, n represents an integer of 1 or more and m+n+p is 2 or more, and R2 represents a trivalent organic group (for example, propane-1,2,3-triyl group and the like)]. For example, a polycaprolactonepolyol produced by ring-opening-polymerizing 6 moles of ε-caprolactone with one mole of ethylene glycol has the following formula: [in-line-formulae]HO—[CH2—CH2—CH2—CH2—CH2—C(═O)—O]3—CH2—CH2—[O—C(═O)—CH2—CH2—CH2—CH2—CH2]3—OH[/in-line-formulae] The polycaprolactonepolyol has about 35 wt % of an oxycarbonyl structure (—O—C(═O)—) part in the molecule, namely, [in-line-formulae](44×6)/(62+114×6)=0.354[/in-line-formulae] wherein, each molecular weight of ε-caprolactone and ethylene glycol is 114 and 62, respectively, and the oxycarbonyl structure has 44 of the molecular weight. Further, the equivalent weight of the hydroxyl group to the polycaprolactonepolyol is 373, namely, [in-line-formulae](62+114×6)/2=373[/in-line-formulae] wherein, the molecular weight of the ε-caprolactone is divided by the number of the hydroxyl group. The molecular weight of the polycaprolactonepolyol is preferably 300 to 5000, more preferably 400 to 2500. Further, the equivalent weight of the hydroxyl group to the polycaprolactonepolyol is usually 200 to 1250. The amount of the polyesterpolyol is usually 15 to 80 parts by weight, preferably 20 to 70 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the aromatic diisocyanate and the polyol. Examples of the C2-C8 polymethylene glycol include ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol and 1,8-octanediol. Among them, 1,4-butanediol and 1,6-hexanediol are preferable. The amount of the polymethylene glycol is usually 1 to 25 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the aromatic diisocyanate and the polyol. Examples of the aromatic diisocyanate include diisocyanate compounds having one or two benzene rings such as 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), tolylene diisocyanate (TDI), xylylene diisocyanate (XDI), tolidine diisocyanate (TODI) and tetramethylenexylylene diisocyanate (TMXDI); and diisocyanate compounds having a naphthalene ring such as naphthalene 1,5-diisocyanate (NDI). Prepolymer such as a reaction product of the above-mentioned aromatic diisocyanate with a polyol may be used as the aromatic diisocyanate. Among them, MDI is preferable. The amount of the aromatic diisocyanate is usually 10 to 49 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the aromatic diisocyanate and the polyol. In an embodiment of the present invention, the polyol mixture for providing the urethane resin comprises a polyesterdiol (e.g., polycaprolactonediol), a C2-C8 polymethylene glycol and a triol (e.g., polycaprolactonetriol, castor oil, hydrogenated castor oil). The amounts of the polyesterdiol, C2-C8 polymethylene glycol, triol and aromatic diisocyanate are usually 20 to 55 parts, 1 to 15 parts, 10 to 40 parts and 10 to 49 parts by weight, respectively. In an embodiment of the present invention, the polyol mixture for providing the urethane resin comprises a polycaprolactonepolyol and a C2-C8 polymethylene glycol, and at least one selected from the group consisting of castor oil and hydrogenated (hardened) castor oil. The amounts of the polycaprolactonepolyol, C2-C8 polymethylene glycol, castor oil and/or hydrogenated castor oil and aromatic diisocyanate are usually 20 to 55 parts, 1 to 15 parts, 10 to 40 parts and 10 to 49 parts by weight, respectively. In the present invention, the molar ratio of the isocyanate (NCO) group in the aromatic diisocyanate to the hydroxyl (OH) group in the polyol mixture is generally 1:0.9-1:1.5, preferably 1:1-1:1.2. The urethane resin is produced usually by reacting an aromatic diisocyanate and a polyol, if necessary in the presence of a catalyst, on the surface of a bioactive substance-containing granule or on a coat film covering a bioactive substance-containing granule. The reaction of an aromatic diisocyanate and a polyol is not particularly restricted, and can be carried out by, for example, a method in which all aromatic diisocyanates and polyols are mixed and hardened, a method in which an aromatic diisocyanates and a part of polyols are mixed previously to prepare a polyisocyanate-terminal prepolymer, then, remaining polyols are mixed and hardened, and other, methods. Further, it is also possible that a small amount of organic solvent is mixed with a diisocyanate and a polyol, and a solvent is removed simultaneously with the reaction. The reaction conditions thereof can be selected arbitrarily, however, when the temperature is raised, the reaction speed of a hydroxyl group and an isocyanate group increases. By adding a catalyst, the reaction speed can be accelerated. Examples of the catalyst to be used for production of a urethane resin include organometal compounds such as potassium acetate, calcium acetate, stannous octoate, dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin dichloride, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutinthiostannic acid, stannous octylate, di-n-octyltin dilaurate, isopropyl titanate, bismuth 2-ethyl hexanoate, phosphine, zinc neodecanoate, tetrabutyl titanate, oxyisopropyl vanadate, n-propyl zirconate and the like, and amine catalysts such as triethylamine, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine, triethylenediamine, N-methylmorpholine, N,N-dimethyldidodecylamine, N-dodecylmorpholine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, N-ethylmorpholine, dimethylethanolamine, N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, 2,4,6-tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol and the like. A mixture having flowability of an aromatic diisocyanate and a polyol (further, catalyst to be added if necessary), before sufficient reaction of a diisocyanate group in the aromatic diisocyanate and a hydroxyl group in the polyol, is expressed as an unhardened urethane resin in some cases.

The coated granule of the present invention can be produced by forming a coat made of the above-mentioned urethane resin around a bioactive substance-containing granule, and the coating method is not particularly restricted. There are mentioned, for example, (1) a method in which a solution or emulsion of a urethane resin prepared separately is sprayed around a bioactive substance-containing granule, then, a solvent is removed to attain coating; (2) a method in which an aromatic diisocyanate and a polyol are added simultaneously to a bioactive substance-containing granule, and on the surface of the bioactive substance-containing granule, a urethane resin is prepared to attain coating; (3) a method in which an aromatic diisocyanate and a polyol are added sequentially to a bioactive substance-containing granule, and on the surface of the bioactive substance-containing granule, a urethane resin is prepared to attain coating; and other methods. An embodiment in the method (2) is a procedure of preparing a mixture of all the polyols and optionally a catalyst, mixing it with the aromatic diisocyanate just before adding to the bioactive substance-containing granule, and then adding the resulting mixture to the bioactive substance-containing granule under fluidizing or tumbling condition. Examples of the embodiments in the method (3) include a procedure of preparing a mixture of all the polyols in advance, adding the mixture and the aromatic diisocyanate by turns to the bioactive substance-containing granule under fluidizing or tumbling condition; a procedure of adding the aromatic diisocyanate, polyesterpolyol and C2-C8 polymethylene glycol, subsequently, to the bioactive substance-containing granule under fluidizing or tumbling condition; and a procedure of adding the polyesterpolyol, aromatic diisocyanate and C2-C8 polymethylene glycol, subsequently, to the bioactive substance-containing granule under fluidizing or tumbling condition. The reaction temperature of the aromatic diisocyanate with polyol is usually 20 to 200° C., preferably 50 to 150° C. Desired elution suppressing ability can be obtained even if the use amount of a resin used for coating is smaller providing a coat film in the coated granule of the present invention is uniform. Thus, it is preferable that the urethane resin is produced by reacting the aromatic diisocyanate and the polyol under the condition without solvent on the surface of a granular material containing a bioactive substance. Examples of the coated granule of the present invention used for applications in the agricultural field include coated granular fertilizers, coated pesticidal granules, solid pesticidal microcapsules, solid pesticidal microspheres and the like. In obtaining the coated granule of the present invention, coating can be performed without using a solvent in resin molding, if an unhardened urethane resin has suitable flowability for a suitable period at temperatures in producing a urethane resin. In the coated granule of the present invention, it is preferable that a urethane resin has a hydrophobic liquid compound having a boiling point of 100° C. or higher from the standpoint of bioactive substance elution suppressing ability. The hydrophobic liquid compound is usually immersed in a urethane resin or supported on its surface. The hydrophobic liquid compound is liquid at 20° C., and examples thereof include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as liquid paraffin, aromatic hydrocarbons such as phenylxylylethane, distyrylxylene, alkylbenzene (Solvesso 150; trade name of Exxon-Mobile Chemical), fatty acid ester compounds such as vegetable oils (e.g., soybean oil, cottonseed oil). In the coated granule of the present invention, it is preferable that the above-mentioned hydrophobic liquid compound is contained in an amount of 0.1 to 5 wt % in the coated granular material of the present invention, and in general, it is preferable that the hydrophobic liquid compound is added in an amount to an extent of slight presence of the hydrophobic liquid compound on the surface of the core granule. The method for producing a coated granule of the present invention will be illustrated in more detail referring to a method for producing a coated granular fertilizer as an example. Particles of a granular fertilizer are made into fluidizing condition or tumbling condition in an apparatus such as a jet flow apparatus, rolling pan, rolling drum and the like. The size of the particle is not particularly restricted, and usually 0.1 to 15mm, and its shape is preferably sphere, and may also be other configuration such as cylinder and the like. The particles under fluidizing or tumbling condition are, if necessary, heated. Next, an unhardened urethane resin as a mixture of an aromatic diisocyanate, a polyol and, a catalyst to be added if necessary, is added to the particle under fluidizing or tumbling condition. The addition method may be either a method of mixing components before quick addition, or a method of adding components separately. Thereafter, while maintaining the fluidizing or tumbling condition of the particles, the reaction of an isocyanate group in the aromatic diisocyanate and a hydroxyl group in the polyol is progressed, thereby, the surface of the particle is coated with a urethane resin. It is preferable to control the amount of the urethane resin to be added so that the thickness of a coat film formed in this one operation is usually 1 to 100 μm. Further, when larger thickness of a coat film is necessary, the thickness of a urethane resin coat film can be increased by repeating the above-mentioned operation. In the coated granule of the present invention, the thickness of an urethane resin coat film is usually 1 to 600 μm, preferably 8 to 400 μm, and the amount thereof is usually 1 to 20 wt % (based on coated granular material of the present invention), preferably 2 to 16 wt %. The particle size of the coated granule of the present invention is usually in the range of 0.1 to 15 mm. When a urethane resin has a hydrophobic liquid compound, the coated granular fertilizer of the present invention can be produced by a method in which a hydrophobic liquid compound is added to the granular fertilizer simultaneously with an unhardened urethane resin, a method in which a hydrophobic liquid compound is added to the granular fertilizer before coating with a urethane resin, a method in which a hydrophobic liquid compound is added, after coating with a urethane resin, to the granular fertilizer coated with a urethane resin, and the like, in the above-mentioned method for producing a coated granular fertilizer, and preferably, produced by a method in which a hydrophobic liquid compound is added to the granular fertilizer before coating with a urethane resin.
