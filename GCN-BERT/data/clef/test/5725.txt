(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-6-(((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)oxy)-1,2,3 ,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-hydroxy-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-1, 2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 92d (2.5 g, 5.821 mmol) was dissolved in 25 mL of dichlormethane, then 2,6-lutidine (1.25 g, 11.641 mmol) and trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (2.46 g, 8.732 mmol) were added at 0°C. The reaction solution was stirred for 2 hours at 0°C, then concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4 -((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-6-(((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)oxy)-1,2,3,4-tetr ahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 92e (2.5 g, yield 76%) as a light yellow solid.
