The present invention relates in general to plant cultivation, particularly for producing cut flowers, and in particular to cultivation out of ground of such plants. Structures intended to be used for cultivating plants or seeds are known. For example, GB-2 088 186 and US-3 667 159 describe seeding platforms adapted to receive seeds only in the first growth period thereof, and intended to be rested on the ground independently to each other. These platforms are made by moulding a foamed plastic material such as polystyrene, so as to define a series of conical seats in each of which a seed together with the respective earth is arranged. At the end of the first growth period of the seed, each little plant must be potted into another container. Beyond to the fact that these known platforms are intended only for the initial growth of seeds, their contact with the ground, if it is not adequately treated by using antiparasitic agents, may favour the contamination of the little plants by the parasites which are present in the ground. Moreover, EP-1 459 620 discloses a platform for cultivating plants, made by a plastic material in order to have thin walls and to define a plurality of containers which delimit shaped seats, each of which is adapted to receive a plant with the respective earth. Some containers of the platform are provided with a lower tubular body, in order to allow the platform to be kept in a condition raised with respect to the ground independently from other possible platforms. The platform of this document, because of its thin wall structure, is not adapted to thermally insulate the plants which are present in its containers in order to keep them in a condition of an ideal temperature for growth, neither it is adapted to be associated with other platforms in order to make a wide modular cultivation structure adapted to optimize the space inside an intensive cultivation area. In particular, the present invention relates to a structure for cultivating plants out of ground, particularly for producing cut flowers, of the type defined in the preamble of claim 1. Such a structure is known for example by US-A-4 453 344. Also US-A-5 507 116, US-A-4 312 152 and GB-A-929 647 disclose, at least in general terms, a structure of the type defined above. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art, the subject of the invention is a cultivating structure of the type defined in the annexed claims. The structure of the invention intends in particular to provide a modular structure for the intensive cultivation of plants out of ground, which can be used for cultivating plants both inside greenhouses or in open areas, and which allows to keep the plants perfectly separated from the ground in order to prevent their contamination by parasites of the earth and to avoid that fertilizers used during the growth of the plants may pollute the ground, keeping at the same time the plants received in the platforms of the structure in a condition of an ideal temperature for growth. Further characteristics of the invention will turn out to be more evident from the following detailed description, which has been provided only as a non-limitative example and is referred to the appended drawings in which: figures 1 to 3 are similar perspective views of three modifications of platforms of the structure according to the invention,figure 4 is an enlarged perspective view showing the arrangement of droplet irrigation pipes on a platform,figure 5 is a fragmentary and sectioned view of a detail indicated by arrow V in figure 4,figure 6 is a perspective view of a sprinkle irrigation pipe which can be associated with a platform in a raised position,figure 7 is a perspective exploded view of the main members of a structure according to the invention,figure 8 is a perspective view of a structure of the invention in its assembled condition,figure 9 is a front elevational view from arrow IX of figure 8, showing a first modification of a support member of the structure,figure 10 is an enlarged perspective view of a foot element indicated by arrow X in figure 8,figure 11 is a front elevational view similar to figure 9, showing a second modification of a support member of the structure,figure 12 is a perspective view of a third modification of a support member of the structure,figure 13 is a perspective schematic view of support means of the structure of the invention, including a support member of the type shown in figure 12,figure 14 is an enlarged perspective view of a box-shaped body indicated by arrow XIV of figure 7, which can be associated with a support member for holding a respective auxiliary upright, andfigure 15 is a perspective view of the box-shaped body of figure 14, in its condition assembled on a support member. With reference to the figures, a modular structure according to the invention, adapted to allow cultivation of plants out of ground, in particular plants for producing cut flowers, comprises a bench structure including a plurality of cultivation platforms generally indicated 10, arranged side by side and aligned longitudinally, and supported at a distance from the ground by support means 34. Each platform 10 has a substantially rectangular shape in plan, with a plurality of cavities delimited downwards by a bottom wall usually pierced by holes 13, each cavity defining a container intended to receive a plant with the relative earth during all its period of growth. Although the containers of each platform commonly have a conical shape with a circular base 12a, they may have any shape, such as an oval cross-section shape 12b, more extended in the longitudinal or in the transverse direction, or a square shape 12c, and may have any dimension as a function of the type of plant and of the amount of earth they will have to contain. Conveniently, each platform 10 is made by a plastic material, and so that the walls thereof are able to get an effect of thermal isulation toward the outer environment, for the plants contained in the containers 12a, 12b or 12c. In particular, the platforms 10 may be made by a foamed plastic material such as polystyrene or similar, or by a pair of half-shells arranged side by side and connected at respective edges in order to delimit an inner air chamber, or by a plastic material deriving from other known workings. A series of guide ducts 16 aligned along the longitudinal direction of the platforms themselves are formed integrally and parallel to the upper surface 14 of the platforms 10, which open at opposite sides into the containers 12a, 12b or 12c and are intended to receive a portion of a droplet irrigation pipe 22, of a type known per se, in order to keep it firmly in its position when such a pipe will be associated longitudinally with a series of adjacent platforms 10 in order to irrigate them. Preferably, the areas of the platforms 10 in which the guide ducts 16 are formed, have an arched or overturned V configuration, in order to allow that possible water droplets which might lie in the channels 16 may fall in one or the other of the two adjacent containers 12a, 12b or 12c. Moreover, each platform 10 has engagement formations made by holes transverse to the surface 14, in order to allow the insertion of hollow coupling sleeves 24. An end portion of a rod 26 is engaged in the sleeves 24, which rod supports at its opposite end a fork coupling formation 28, and which constitutes a holding arm adapted to support a sprinkle irrigation pipe 30 in a position raised with respect to the platforms 10. Thermal conditioning means of a type per se known, usually including pipes (not shown) in which a warm fluid flows, may be associated below the platforms 10 by support brackets, for example in the longitudinal cavity defined between the containers 12a or 12b. Conveniently, a series of through openings 32 (only shown with reference to the platform 10 provided with the containers 12a) are formed in the platform 10 above such a longitudinal cavity, which openings are adapted to allow the passage of the warm air from below the platform 10, starting from a zone close to the thermal conditioning means, to above the platform 10 where the plants to be cultivated are arranged. In the case of the platform 10 provided with the containers 12c, through holes (not shown) may be provided in the flanks of such containers, which holes extend in the longitudinal direction of the platform in order to allow the insertion of the conditioning pipes in such a manner that they may be incorporated in the earth contained in the containers 12a. A warm fluid can be fed into these pipes in order to heat the earth and the roots of the plants to be cultivated during the cold season, or a cooled fluid in order to cool the earth and the roots during the warm season, in the event of particular cultivations. A series of platforms 10 arranged adjacent and aligned in the longitudinal direction is supported at a distance from the ground by support means 34, which have also a modular structure. Such support means 34 comprise essentially a pair of longitudinal members 36 adapted to be inserted in corresponding longitudinal seats 20 formed integrally on the lower surface of the platforms 10, as well as a series of stand members, indicated in general by reference numeral 38, which allow to support the longitudinal members 36 to a predetermined height with respect to the ground. Preferably, the longitudinal members 36 are made by metallic profiled sections having an overturned U cross-section, mutually connected to each other at the ends by means of male/female coupling elements, in such a manner to allow to reach a length corresponding to the longitudinal extension of the structure to be used. Moreover, generally C-shaped elastic clip members (not shown in the figures) may be used in order to connect more firmly the platforms 10 to the longitudinal members 36, which can be snap engaged at predetermined positions of the platforms, for example in a central portion of their longer sides, so as to lock jointly the platforms 10 with respect to the longitudinal members 36. The stand members 38, which are conveniently of plastic material such as polyethylene or similar, may be made in a different manner depending on the load they will have to support or on the desired height of the platforms 10 with respect to the ground, as a consequence of the type of plants to be cultivated. In the most general case, the stand members 38 include a support member in the shape of a flat frame (indicated in the figures by reference numerals 40a, 40b, 40c), and at least a foot member 44, having also a flat structure. Each flat frame support member may be connected with one or two foot members arranged according to a perpendicular configuration, by means of a snap connection, so as to make the assemblying step of the whole structure fast and easy. Each foot member 44 (see in particular figure 10) has a generally triangular shape with a vertical reinforcing upright 45. A longitudinal slit 70 is formed inside the upright 45 in a position closer to the vertex thereof, which is interrupted by a transversal plate 72. At the vertex and at the center of the base side of each foot member 44, respective opposite hollow seats 58 and 60 are formed, whose function will be made more clear in the following. Moreover, at the base vertices of each foot member 44 respective vertical through holes (not shown in the figures) may be formed in order to allow the insertion of nails intended to fasten the structure to the ground. A first modification of a support element, shown in figures 7, 8 and 9, consists of a flat frame 40a intended to be associated with two foot members 44. The frame 40a includes a pair of vertical side uprights 48a connected downwards by a crosspiece 50 and upwards by a saddle structure which comprises a pair of tilted rods arranged substantially according to a V configuration. A pair of secondary vertical uprights 49 extend between the rods 52 and the crosspiece 50. The side uprights 48a end upwardly with finger appendages 54 projecting upwards to engage the inner cavity of the longitudinal members 36. A bracket member 56, intended to be inserted in the upper seat 58 of the respective foot member 44 when it is assembled, extends from each side upright 48a towards the opposite upright 48a, while the lower seat 60 of the same foot member 44 is engaged by a portion of the crosspiece 50. Each upright 48a, in a portion thereof close to the crosspiece 50, has a projection 53 projecting towards the inside of the frame 40a and intended to be inserted in the slit 70 of the respective foot member 44, in order to connect more firmly the foot members 44. A recess 53a is formed in a position corresponding to each projections 53 but on the outer side of the respective upright 48a, from which a tilted hole (not shown in the figures) extends, which crosses the upright 48a and also a portion of the crosspiece 50, in order to allow to insert a nail for fastening the structure to the ground. A series of channel shaped elements 55 are preferably interposed between the platforms 10 and the longitudinal members 36, preferably made by a molded plastic material, for example PET, and rested one on the other at their longitudinal ends so as to form a single channel whose extension is equal to that of the whole structure, in order to collect water falling from the holes 13 of the bottom of the containers 12a, 12b or 12c, and to direct it up to the end of the structure, so as to avoid it may fall directly on the ground. Each channel element 55 has vertical side walls 57 provided with folded edges 57a adapted to be supported on the longitudinal members 36, at the longitudinal seats 20 of the platforms 10, in order to keep the elements 55 associated with the support means 34. Preferably, a series of windows 57b is formed on the side walls 57 of the elements 55 in order to avoid the moisture may stagnate and produce condensate inside the elements 55. In the event the structure of the invention has to be used on a level ground so that the channel formed by the elements 55 does not have a sufficient slope to assure the correct outflow of the water, the elements 55 may be pierced at a bottom portion thereof and gutter elements 94 (figures 8 and 9) may be associated with the series of frame 40a of the structure so as to allow that a gutter is made below the elements 55. Each gutter element 94 has a central concave portion from whose opposite sides a pair of longitudinal edges extend, intended to be inserted between the teeth of a pair of opposite serrations 96 formed integrally on the secondary uprights 49 of the support element 40a. In particular, by virtue of the presence of such serrations 96, the slope of the gutter elements 94 may be easily adjusted between one frame 40a and the subsequent one, in order to allow to obtain a drain channel having the desired slope. Each side upright 48a of the support elements 40a has a series of seats 83 and 87 in proximity of the respective finger appendage 54, so that connection of a box-shaped body 82 (see in particular figures 14 and 15) having a bottom wall 88 and intended to define a holding pocket 68 is allowed. Each body 82 comprises in particular a pair of upper appendages 84 each having its free end rounded and adapted to be inserted in the seats 83 of the uprights 48a with possibility of rotation, as well as a plurality of tooth appendages 86 intended to snap engage the seats 87 of the same uprights. In order to connect a body 82 to an upright 48a, firstly the appendages 84 threof are inserted in the seats 83 of an upright 48a, so that the body 82 assumes the dashes line position of figure 15 and then, as a result of a rotation of the body 82 in the direction indicated by arrow A of figure 15, the body 82 is brought into a configuration parallel to the upright 48a, until its appendages 86 penetrate in the seats 87. In the pockets 68 so made, respective auxiliary uprights 90, for example provided with a series of hook formations, can be inserted, which allow to support a net 92 intended for supporting the stalks of the plants arranged on the platforms 10 during the growth thereof, with an adjustable height. As an alternative or in combination, the pockets 68 may be used for receiving support uprights of a removable laminar cover (not shown) adapted to define a greenhouse structure superimposed to the platforms 10. The aforesaid series of seats 83 and 87 for the engagement of the appendages 84 and 86 of a body 82 may be made, besides that in proximity of each finger appendage 54, also in a lower zone of a side upright 48a, for example in proximity of the recesses 53a. In this case, according to a modification not shown, the bodies 82 are not provided with the bottom wall 88, so that an auxiliary upright 90 associated with a side upright 48a of a support element 40a will have a length greater than that represented in figure 8, so as to engage simultaneously two bodies 82 associated with the same upright 48a at different heights, in order to assure a more firm positioning of the upright 90. In a second modification of the support element shown in figure 11, in which similar reference numerals have been used to indicate parts equal or similar to those of the previous modification, and for which only the parts different from the previous modification will be described, the support element is indicated by reference 40b. The element 40b has a flat frame shape with its side uprights 48b tilted and connected by a pair of rods 52 arranged according to a V configuration so as to define a vertex facing the lower crosspiece 50 of the respective frame. In this case, a single foot member 44 is associated with the support element 40b, whose upper and lower seats 58 and 60 are adapted to snap engage a fork formation 62 at the vertex defined by the rods 52, and a seat 64 formed centrally on the crosspiece 50, respectively. In a third modification of the support element shown in figures 12 and 13, in which similar reference numerals have been used to indicate parts equal or similar to those of the previous modification, and for which only the different parts are described, the support element is indicated by reference 40c. In particular, this modification is adapted for cultivating plants with a higher stalk, the respective support element being usually smaller than those of the previous modifications. The element 40c has a rectangular flat frame shape, and is intended to be associated with two foot members 44. Four opposite bracket formations extend sideways from the element 40c, two upper bracket formations 66 and two lower bracket formations 68, provided with an end projection. The upper bracket formations 66 are adapted to engage the upper seats 58 of the foot members 44 while the lower bracket formations 68 are intended to be inserted in their lower seats 60, respectively. In this case, the vertex portion of the foot members 44, which extends beyond the top of the element 40c, engages directly the hollow seat of the longitudinal members 36.
