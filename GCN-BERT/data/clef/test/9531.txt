(10) Preparation of tetra(n-butyl)ammonium (2S,5R)-2-((8-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabi cyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl sulfatesalt
Tert-butyl 3-((2S,5R)-6-hydroxyl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxamido)-8-azabicyclo[3.2. 1]octane-8-carboxylate (0.3 g, 0.76 mmol) was dissolved in isopropanol (3 mL) and water (3 mL), and triethylamine (20 mg, 0.2 mmol) and sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine complex (0.15 g, 1.1 mmol) were added. The reaction solution was stirred and reacted at 25 °C for 12 h, and ethyl acetate (10 mL) and water (10 mL) were added. The phases were separated, to the aqueous phase was added an aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (0.26 g, 0.76 mmol), extracted with dichloromethane (10 mL×3), and the organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtrated, concentrated to obtain the title compound in white color (0.32 g, yield 59.2 %).
