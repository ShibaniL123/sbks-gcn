Methods and Compositions Comprising 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid [0001] This application claims the benefit of the filing date of United States Provisional Patent Application No. 61/990,283 filed May 8, 2014, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. [0002] Disclosed herein are compositions for treating anxiety, inflammatory conditions and fertility-related disorders, and for increasing cognitive performance and managing weight comprising 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid and at least one polyunsaturated fatty acid. Further disclosed herein are methods for treating anxiety, inflammatory conditions and fertility-related disorders, and for increasing cognitive performance and managing weight, comprising administration of 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid, wherein such method may further comprise administration of at least one polyunsaturated fatty acid. [0003] Queen bee acid (10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid) is the predominant fatty acid constituent of royal jelly. Royal jelly is harvested from a select population of cells that specifically support the growth and development of queen bee larvae and is provided to the queen bee by the drones. Royal jelly is believed to play a role in the enhanced size, fertility and lifespan of queen bees. It is believed that queen bee acid (10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid) is one of the principal active components of royal jelly. [0004] Queen bee acid inhibits histone deacetylases and is now recognized as the epigenetic switch for the queen bee larvae phenotype (Spannhoff et al., Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Activity in Royal Jelly Might Facilitate Caste Switching in Bees, EMBO Reports, Vol. 12, No. 3, 2011). Other in vitro effects of queen bee acid include antitumor activity (Townsend et al., Studies on the in vitro Antitumor Activity of Fatty Acids: I. 10-Hydroxy-2- decenoic Acid from Royal Jelly, Cancer Res, 1960; 20:503-510; Izuta et al., 10-Hydroxy-2- decenoic Acid, a Major Fatty Acid from Royal Jelly Inhibits VEGF-induced Angiogenesis in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, eCam, 2009;6(4)489-494) and stimulation of neurogenesis from stem cells while inhibiting gliogenesis (Hattori et al, Royal Jelly Facilitates Restoration of the Cognitive Ability in Trimethyltin-Intoxicated Mice, eCAM 2009). These findings suggest that queen bee acid may be an active component of royal jelly. [0005] It has now been found that queen bee acid (10-hydroxy-decenoic acid) has an effect in the treatment of anxiety, inflammatory conditions and fertility-related disorders, and may increase cognitive performance and help manage weight, wherein managing weight is maintaining weight in a subject having a diseased state, or weight loss, particularly where such weight loss is due to age or stress. [0006] The queen bee acid can be in the form of a free fatty acid, salt, fatty acid ester (e.g., methyl or ethyl ester), monoacylglycerol (MAG), diacy glycerol (DAG) triacylglycerol (TAG), and/or phospholipid (PL) or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the queen bee acid is in the free fatty acid or salt form. [0007] Disclosed herein are compositions for treating anxiety, inflammatory conditions and fertility-related disorders, and for increasing cognitive performance and managing weight comprising 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid and at least one polyunsaturated fatty acid.

[0011] Disclosed herein are compositions for treating anxiety, inflammatory conditions and fertility-related disorders, and for increasing cognitive performance and managing weight comprising 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid or a derivative thereof, and at least one polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Further disclosed herein are methods for treating anxiety, inflammatory conditions and fertility-related disorders, and for increasing cognitive performance and managing weight, wherein such methods comprise administration of 10- Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid or a derivative thereof, and further comprising administration of at least one polyunsaturated fatty acid. [0012] In a further embodiment, compositions are provided comprising about 0.2 mg to about 5000 mg 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid and about 100 mg to about 4000 mg DHA in the form preferably of one or more capsules. Preferably, the respective amounts are about 12 mg to about 300 mg 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid mg and about 100 mg to about 1500 mg DHA. In the one or more capsules, the 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid may be provided in a form of a free acid or an ester. In particular, the free acid preferably is provided separate from DHA. In case both components are provided as esters, the QBA-ester may be combined with DHA in one dosage form. An advantage of providing the components in ester- form is that the components show improved stability, and can be provided in combined capsules. [0013] The features and advantages of the invention may be more readily understood by those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description. It is to be appreciated that certain features of the invention that are, for clarity reasons, described above and below in the context of separate embodiments, may also be combined as to subcombinations thereof. [0014] Embodiments identified herein as exemplary are intended to be illustrative and not limiting. [0015] The term "about" is intended to capture variations above and below the stated number that may achieve substantially the same results as the stated number. [0016] The term "therapeutically-effective amount" refers to that amount of a compound sufficient to modulate one or more of the symptoms of the condition or disease being treated. A "therapeutically-effect amount" and/or dosage range for compounds used in the method of treatment of the invention may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art via known criteria including age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and interpreted within the context of the disease being treated and/or prevented. [0017] "10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid" may be alternatively referred to as "Queen Bee Acid" or "QBA". It is understood that 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid is the chemical formula for "Queen Been Acid ("QBA")". [0018] Fatty acids are classified based on the length and saturation characteristics of the carbon chain. Fatty acids present in a microbial oil can have from 4 to 28 carbon atoms and are termed short chain, medium chain, or long chain fatty acids based on the number of carbons present in the chain. Fatty acids are termed saturated fatty acids when no double bonds are present between the carbon atoms, and are termed unsaturated fatty acids when double bonds are present. Unsaturated long chain fatty acids are monounsaturated when only one double bond is present and are polyunsaturated when more than one double bond is present. [0019] Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are classified based on the position of the first double bond from the methyl end of the fatty acid; omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids contain a first double bond at the third carbon, while omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids contain a first double bond at the sixth carbon. For example, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) with a chain length of 22 carbons and 6 double bonds, often designated as "22:6n-3." [0020] In one embodiment, the PUFA is selected from an omega-3 fatty acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, and mixtures thereof. In another embodiment, the PUFA is selected from long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC -PUFAs). In another embodiment, the LC PUFA has 20 carbon atoms or more, preferably C20 or C22 carbon atoms. In a still further embodiment, the PUFA is selected from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DP A), arachidonic acid (ARA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), stearidonic acid (SDA), and mixtures thereof. In another embodiment, the PUFA is selected from DHA, ARA, and mixtures thereof. In a further embodiment, the PUFA is ARA. In yet a further embodiment, the PUFA is DHA. [0021] The PUFAs can be in the form of a free fatty acid, salt, fatty acid ester (e.g., methyl or ethyl ester), monoacylglycerol (MAG), diacylglycerol (DAG), triacylglycerol (TAG), and/or phospholipid (PL), or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the PUFA is in the ethyl ester or glyceryl ester form, like the TAG form. [0022] Any source of PUFA can be used in the compositions and methods of the invention, including, for example, animal, plant and microbial sources. Preferred polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) sources can be any source of PUFA that are suitable for use in the present invention. [0023] Examples of animal sources include aquatic animals (e.g., fish, marine mammals, crustaceans, rotifers, etc.). Examples of plant sources include microalgae, flaxseeds, rapeseeds, corn, evening primrose and borage. Examples of microorganisms include microalgae, protists, bacteria and fungi (including yeast). The use of a microorganism source, such as microalgae, can provide organoleptic advantages. Preferably, the polyunsaturated fatty acid source comprises microalgae or microalgal oils. [0024] Preferably, when microorganisms are the source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the microorganisms are cultured in a fermentation medium in a fermenter. Alternatively, the microorganisms can be cultured photosynthetically in a photobioreactor or pond.

EXAMPLES Example 1 [0073] The concentration-response characteristics of 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid's (Queen Bee Acid; QBA) potential neurodevelopmental and brain health benefits were assessed in vitro. [0074] Neurons from the brain's hippocampus were derived from embryonic day (El 7) rat pups and incubated with QBA for 7 days. The cultures were then stained with neuron-specific marker, microtubule associated protein-2a (Map2a) and cell nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescent images of the staining were then captured with a confocal microscope. The staining was quantitated by dividing the percent area of the Map2a staining by the number of neurons. As shown by the results in Table 1, QBA increased the growth of brain cells in culture. Table 1 : In vitro Neurite Extension [0075] Neurons from the brain's hippocampus were derived from El 7 pups and incubated for 7 days. The cells were pre-treated with QBA for 48 hours and subsequently challenged with glutamate (25 μΜ) for 24 hours. The cultures were then stained with propidium iodide, a marker of cell death, and with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), a marker for mitochondrial health. The fluorescence of each of these markers was then quantitated with a fluorimeter. As shown by the results in Tables 2 and 3, QBA decreased cell death and increased cell health after the age-related neurodegenerative insult of glutamate toxicity. Table 2: Cell Death Table 3: Mitochondrial Health [0076] Neurons from the brain's hippocampus were derived from El 7 pups and incubated for 7 days. The neurons were then pre-treated with QBA for 48 hours and subsequently exposed to a hypoxia (< 0.3% (¾) for 48 hours. The cultures were stained with calcein AM, a marker of live cells, and with ethidium homodimer, a marker for dead cells. The fluorescence of each of these markers was then quantitated with a fluorimeter. [0077] As shown by the results in Tables 4 and 5, QBA decreased cell death and increased cell health after the age-related insult of low oxygen exposure. Table 4: In vitro Hypoxia Cell Death Table 5: In vitro Cell Health Example 2 [0078] The dose-response characteristics of 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid's (QBA's) potential brain health benefits during aging were assessed for mood in older rats (18-20 months old). [0079] Rats were fed QBA and subjected to an elevated plus-maze. The elevated plus-maze was elevated -85 cm above the floor and consisted of two open and two closed arms of the same size (50x10 cm). The closed arms were surrounded by walls 40 cm high, and the arms were constructed of black acrylic slabs that radiated from a central platform (10x10 cm) to form a plus sign. Each rat was placed in the central platform facing one of the open arms, and its behavior was recorded during a 5-min testing period with video capture software. More time spent in the open arms is an indication of reduced anxiety-like state. Rats were tested at 18 months old (N=l 1-13 per group). [0080] In the open field test each rat was placed in a novel environment consisting of an arena measuring 100 x 100 x 40 cm. Rats were placed in the middle of the chamber and behavior in the open field was recorded for thirty minutes with a digital camera and measured by software. More time spent in the center of the area is an indication of a reduced anxietylike state. Rats were tested at 15 months old (N=l l-12 per group). QBA (24 mg/kg/d) decreased anxiety in 15-18-month old male rats as measured by the time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze (Table 5) and by the number of center entries in the open field arena (Table 6). Table 5: Time in Open Arms - Elevated Plus Maze Table 6: Center Entries - Open Field QBA Dose Center Entries (#) (mg/kg/day) 0 1.46 0.4 1.82 4 2.50 12 1.82 Example 3 [0081] The dose-response characteristics of 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid's (QBA's) in combination with DHA for potential brain health benefits during aging were assessed for mood in 19-20 month-old male rats (N=l 1-14 per group). Rats were fed QBA alone or QBA + DHA and subjected to an elevated plus-maze. [0082] QBA + DHA decreased anxiety in rats similar to QBA alone as measured by the time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze (Table 7). Table 7: Time in Open Arms - Elevated Plus Maze Example 4 [0083] Cultures of the RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell line were pre-treated with 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (QBA) for 1 hour prior to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/niL). After 24 hours of incubation, interleukin 1 β (IL-Ιβ) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) levels were determined by Luminex technology and cell numbers were measured using Alamar Blue. Results are given as a ratio of cytokine concentration/cell number. [0084] As shown in Tables 9 and 10, QBA reduced the production of IL-Ιβ and TNFa in immune cells. Table 9: IL-Ιβ levels Table 10: Example 5 [0085] Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were pre-treated with 10- Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (QBA) for 1 hour prior to stimulation with aCD3/CD28. After 72 hours of incubation, cell number was assessed by Cell Titer Glow. [0086] As shown by the results in Table 1 1, concentrations of greater than 500 μΜ reduced the proliferation of human immune cells. Table 11: Proliferation of PBMC Example 6 [0087] The dose-response characteristics of 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid's (QBA's) potential brain health benefits during aging were assessed for cognitive performance in older male rats (16-17 months old; N=10-12 per group). Rats were fed QBA for 4-5 months prior to behavioral assessment. Spatial learning and memory performance was tested using the Barnes circular maze which consists of a 4-ft diameter, gray circular platform raised 90 cm above the floor level with 20 holes, 10 cm in diameter, evenly spaced around the circumference. Animals were trained to locate a black escape tunnel beneath one of the holes in response to aversive light stimuli. The latency to enter the escape box in each of two trials across four trial days was recorded. Shorter latencies across and within trial days is an indication of better cognitive performance. [0088] As shown by the results in Table 12, QBA increased the speed of learning acquisition in older (aged 16-17 months old) male rates as measured by the Barnes maze task. Table 12: Learning Acquisition - Barnes maze task Example 7 [0089] Aged male rats were fed 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (QBA) for approximately 7 months from 1 1 -months to 18-months of age and the weight of rats was recorded. [0090] QBA helped to maintain healthy body weight in a cohort of aging male rats ( =l l-14 per group). The data was analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA and the data showed a small but significant increase for all doses versus the control (0 mg/kg/day QBA). Table 13: Weight Significantly different (p<0.05) in Tukey's post hoc test from control Example 8 [0091] Aged male rats were fed 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (QBA) for approximately 7 months from 12-months to 20-months of age and the weight of rats was recorded. [0092] QBA helped to maintain healthy body weight in a cohort of aging male rats ( =l l-14 per group). The data was analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA and the data showed a small but significant increase for all doses versus the control (0 mg/kg/day QBA or 0 mg/kg/day QBA + 0.07% DHA). Table 14: Weight QBA Dose (mg/kg/day) 0 12 24 0 12 24 DHA (% weight of diet) 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.07% 0.07% 0.07% Study Day Avg Wt (g) Avg Wt (g) Avg Wt (g) Avg Wt (g) Avg Wt (g) Avg Wt (g) 130 612.8 616.9 630.3 635.2 620.2 625.4 137 615.2 621.5 633.5 633.1 624.4 629.4 144 619.9 619.1 642.1 632.5 626.2 627.5 151 624.0 620.5 638.6 634.6 625.4 633.4 Example 9 [0093] Aged male rats were fed 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (QBA) for approximately 7 months from 12-months to 20-months of age and the weight of rats was recorded (N=l l-14 per group). During the last month of QBA feeding animals were subjected to the psychological stress of the Barnes maze. [0094] QBA and QBA + DHA mitigated weight loss associated with the psychological stress, but DHA alone did not produce the same results. The data was analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA and the data showed a small but significant increase for all doses versus the control (0 mg/kg/day QBA or 0 mg/kg/day QBA + 0.07% DHA). Table 15: Weight after Barnes maze Example 10 [0095] Adult female Long-Evans rats (3 months-old) with abnormal ovulatory cycles were fed diets containing 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (QBA) or no QBA for six (6) weeks. Female rats having normal ovulatory cycle were used as positive controls and were not fed QBA. [0096] As shown in Table 16, supplementation with QBA at 12 mg/kg/day resulted in a similar proportion of normal to abnormal ovulatory cycle animals as the positive control group. Table 16: Ovulatory Cycle Status Example 1 1 [0097] Young adult female Long-Evans rats (3 months-old) with abnormal ovulatory cycles were fed diets containing 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (QBA) or no QBA for eight (8) weeks and then mated with a male rat. Female rats having normal ovulatory cycles were used as positive controls and were not fed QBA. The conception index was determined. The conception index is a measure of conception efficiency and is equal to the number of pregnancies divided by the number of discernable mating sessions multiplied by 100. [0098] As shown by the results in Table 17, supplementation with QBA increased the conception index. Table 17: Conception Index Example 12 [0099] Mice (45 days of age) were fed 60 mg/kg body weight/day QBA (equivalent to 24 mg/kg/d in rats; HED of -240 mg/day, N=10) or a control diet (N=15) for 28 days. Mice fed QBA had a greater percentage increase in body weight than mice fed the control diet with no differences in food consumption. After 28 days, all 10 of the mice fed QBA and 10 of the 15 control mice were subjected to a cell transfer insult wherein the mice were considered to be in a colitis-related disease state. The undiseased controls (N=5) and the diseased controls (N=10) continued on their control diets, and the diseased QBA-fed animals continued on their QBA diets (60 mg/kg body weight/day QBA), for an additional 49 days. [00100] QBA-treated mice in a diseased state maintained their weight similar to the undiseased control mice and were found to be no different than the undiseased controls. In contrast, the diseased controls lost significant weight in comparison to the undiseased controls over the course of the study.
