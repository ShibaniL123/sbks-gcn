Example 8. (R)-N-methyl-N-(1-(methylsulfonyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine
70.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask, and then dissolved with 1.0 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 0.0250 mL of methanesulfonyl chloride was added thereto, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0590 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and then stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and then purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 40.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(1-(methylsulfonyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 42.1%.
