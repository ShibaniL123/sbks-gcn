1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-bromo-8-(N-{(R)-Î±-[N-2-sulphoethyl)carbamoyl]-4-hydroxybenzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine
To a solution of 1,1-dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-bromo-8-carboxymethoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Method 2; 0.050 g, 9.27*10-5 mol) in DMF (6 ml) was added 2-{[(2R)-2-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanoyl]amino}ethanesulphonic acid (Method 6; 0.033 g, 1.20*10-4 mol) and N-methylmorpholine (0.041 ml, 3.72*10-4 mol). The mixture was stirred for 10 min and then TBTU (0.039 g, 1.21*10-4 mol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC using an MeCN / ammonium acetate buffer as eluent and freeze-dried, to give the title compound in 0.039 g (53 %) as a white solid. NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) 0.60-0.80 (m, 6H), 0.80-1.60 (m, 12H), 2.40-2.60 (m, 2H), 3.10-3.50 (m, 2H), 3.85 (brs, 2H), 4.70 (d (AB), 1H), 4.75 (d (AB), 1H), 5.25 (d, 1H), 6.70 (s, 1H), 6.75 (s, 1H), 6.85-7.80 (m, 10H), 8.15-8.25 (m, 1H). 8.45 (d, 1H), 9.40 (brs, 1H).
