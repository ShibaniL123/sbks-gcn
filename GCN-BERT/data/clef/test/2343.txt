A mixture of N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)azetidin-3-amine (220 mg, 0.51 mmol), 1-fluoro-3-iodopropane (106 mg, 0.57 mmol), and DIPEA (0.270 mL, 1.54 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The reaction was diluted with DCM and washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM, and the combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by preparative HPLC (Xbridge C18 column, 19 mm×150 mm; 5 μm; flow rate: 20 mL/min), eluting with 40 to 80% acetonitrile in water containing 0.2% ammonium hydroxide. Product fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by preparative SFC (2-ethylpyridine column, 19 mm×150 mm, 5 μm; flow rate: 75 mL/min; column temperature: 40° C.; outlet pressure: 100 bar), eluting with 15% methanol containing 0.2% ammonium hydroxide in carbon dioxide, to afford N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (82 mg, 33% two steps) as a white solid.
