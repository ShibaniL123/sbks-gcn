Step 5: (R)-4-(2-((2-(8-(Benzyloxy)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl)benzoic acid
A solution of (R)-phenyl 4-(2-((2-(8-(benzyloxy)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate (4.5 g, 6.0 mmol) in THF (30 mL) was added with 2M aqueous sodium hydroxide (30 mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to half the initial volume and then diluted with water (25 mL). The resulting mixture was acidified to pH 3 using 2M aqueous hydrochloric acid and then extracted with ethyl acetate (Ã—3). The combined organic phases were washed sequentially with water, brine (25 ml), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the title compound (4 g, 100%). Material used directly in the next step.
