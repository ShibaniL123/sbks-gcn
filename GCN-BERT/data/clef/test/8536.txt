TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a radically polymerizable composition, a cured product prepared by curing the composition, and a plastic lens formed of the composition. BACKGROUND ART Recently, resin materials have been widely used in optical parts such as an optical over-coating agent, a hard coating agent, an antireflection film, an eyeglass lens, an optical fiber, an optical waveguide, and a hologram because resin materials have good workability and high productivity. Resin materials having a high refractive index have been anticipated due to the trend of reducing the sizes and thicknesses of optical parts or from the viewpoint of controlling antireflection property. In particular, there have recently been growing demands for reduction in size and increases in resistivity and brightness in liquid crystal display elements used as a display of a liquid crystal television, a notebook computer, a portable gaming device, a cellular mobile phone, or the like. To meet these demands, it is essential to increase the refractive index of prism sheets. Manufacture of formed materials such as a prism sheet requires optical materials having a high refractive index and a low viscosity. However, existing resin materials have a problem in that an increase in refractive index results in an increase in viscosity and leads to crystallization. There has recently been proposed, as an optical material having a high refractive index, a compound having a fluorene skeleton to provide a material having a high refractive index. Known examples of such a compound include a difunctional compound in which an acryloyl group is bonded to a fluorene skeleton through an alkyleneoxy group (see PTLs 1 to 3); and a compound produced by reacting a diglycidyl ether having a fluorene skeleton with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid (see PTL 4). These compounds have received attention since they have high heat resistance and a high refractive index. However, these fluorene derivatives have the following problem. These fluorene derivatives are generally solids or liquids having a high viscosity of several tens of Pa·s or more at ordinary temperature. Therefore, when these fluorene derivatives are used for formed materials such as a prism sheet, dilution with a large amount of reactive diluent or the like is required to achieve an adequate viscosity. This reduces the refractive index of the resulting cured product. Examples of currently used reactive diluents include phenylthioethyl acrylate (PTEA), o-phenylphenoxyethyl acrylate (OPPEA), and naphthylthioethyl acrylate (NTEA). PTEA, despite having a high refractive index and a low viscosity, is not preferable because of its poor lightfastness and strong odor due to sulfur contained therein, which results in poor workability. NTEA is unsatisfactory in terms of lightfastness since it has a naphthalene ring. Thus, currently, OPPEA is often selected. A combination of a difunctional (meth)acrylate compound having a fluorene skeleton and OPPEA has been proposed as a composition for use in optical materials (see PTL 5). However, OPPEA, despite being a reactive diluent having a relatively high refractive index of 1.576, fails to reduce the viscosity of the difunctional (meth)acrylate compound having a fluorene skeleton sufficiently when used alone. Therefore, an example described in PTL 5 employs a reactive diluent as a third component. Thus, a reactive diluent that has a high refractive index and that allows the resulting composition to have a sufficiently low viscosity for formed material use has been anticipated.

Solution to Problem The inventors of the present invention have conducted extensive studies to achieve the object and, as a result, have found that a radically polymerizable composition having a high refractive index suitable for use in optical materials and a low viscosity can be provided by including phenylbenzyl acrylate; and bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl or a biphenyl compound having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a radically polymerizable composition including phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A); and bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) or a biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene. The present invention also relates to a radically polymerizable composition further including, in addition to the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene, a (meth)acrylate compound (Y) having a fluorene skeleton. The present invention further relates to a cured product formed by curing the radically polymerizable composition. The present invention further relates to a plastic lens formed of the radically polymerizable composition. Advantageous Effects of Invention According to the present invention, there can be provided a radically polymerizable composition that has a low viscosity suitable for use in coating and that forms a cured product having a high refractive index, and a cured product and a plastic lens that are formed by curing the composition. The radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention can be widely applied to optical parts such as an optical over-coating agent, a hard coating agent, an antireflection film, an eyeglass lens, an optical fiber, an optical waveguide, a hologram, and a prism.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A) included in a radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention may be ortho-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (OPBA), meta-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (MPBA), or para-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (PPBA). These compounds may be used alone or in combination of two or more. Among these compounds, ortho-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate and meta-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate are preferable because they have a relatively high refractive index and a low viscosity: a refractive index of 1.57 or more and a viscosity of 30 mPa·s or less in the form of a liquid at 25° C. Para-phenylbenzyl acrylate is also preferable because it has a considerably high refractive index of 1.59 or more in the form of a liquid at 40° C., while being solid at ordinary temperature. In particular, ortho-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate, meta-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate, and para-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate are preferably used in combination in order to achieve both a sufficiently low viscosity of the composition and a sufficiently high refractive index of the cured product formed of the composition. In this case, the mixing ratio is preferably set in such a manner that the molar ratio of ortho-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate and meta-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate to para-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate [{[ortho-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate]+[meta-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate]}/[para-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate]] is 55/45 to 10/90 in order to provide a composition that has a low viscosity and that forms a cured product having a sufficiently high refractive index. Furthermore, among these compounds, ortho-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate and para-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate are preferably used in combination because they are relatively easily manufactured. In this case, the mixing ratio is preferably set in such a manner that the molar ratio of ortho-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate to para-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate [[ortho-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate]/[para-phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate]] is 55/45 to 10/90 in order to provide a composition that has a low viscosity and that forms a cured product having a sufficiently high refractive index. The phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A) is produced by, for example, a method in which biphenyl methanol and (meth)acrylic acid are esterified or a method in which a halogenated methylbiphenyl such as chloromethylbiphenyl or bromomethylbiphenyl is caused to react with a salt of (meth)acrylic acid and an alkali metal such as potassium, sodium, or lithium. In the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention, the content of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A) is preferably 10 to 95 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the nonvolatile content of the radically polymerizable composition in order to form a cured product having a high refractive index. The content of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A) is more preferably 30 to 85 parts by mass in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition that forms a cured product having good releasability. The content of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A) is preferably 45 to 80 parts by mass and more preferably 50 to 75 in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition having a lower viscosity. Since the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) included in the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention has an aromatic ring in its molecular structure, a cured coating film having a high refractive index can be produced by adding the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B). In addition, since the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) has two (meth)acryloyl groups in its molecular structure, good curability is exhibited through radical polymerization. This contributes to an effect of improving the toughness of the resulting coating film. Examples of the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) include 2,2′-bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]-1,1′-biphenyl, 3,3′-bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]-1,1′-biphenyl, 4,4′-bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]-1,1′-biphenyl, 2,4′-bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]-1,1′-biphenyl, 2,4-bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]-1,1′-biphenyl, and 2,6-bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]-1,1′-biphenyl. These compounds may be used alone or in combination of two or more. Among these compounds, from the viewpoint of ease of manufacture, 2,2′-bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]-1,1′-biphenyl, 3,3′-bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]-1,1′-biphenyl, and 4,4′-bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]-1,1′-biphenyl are preferable, and 4,4′-bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]-1,1′-biphenyl is more preferable. The bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) is produced by, for example, a method in which biphenyldimethanol and (meth)acrylic acid are esterified or a method in which a bis(halogenated methyl)biphenyl such as bis(chloromethyl)biphenyl or bis(bromomethyl)biphenyl is caused to react with (meth)acrylic acid. In the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention, the content of the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) is preferably 5 to 70 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the nonvolatile content of the radically polymerizable composition in order to form a cured product having a high refractive index and high toughness. The content of the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) is more preferably 10 to 50 parts by mass in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition that forms a cured product having higher heat resistance. The content of the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) is preferably 15 to 30 parts by mass in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition having a lower viscosity. Since the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene used in the present invention has an aromatic ring in its molecular structure, a cured coating film having a high refractive index can be produced by adding the biphenyl compound (C). In the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene, the number of biphenyl structure units in its molecular structure is preferably 2 to 5 in order to achieve high solubility in the other components included in the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention. The biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene is produced by, for example, a method in which biphenyl is caused to react with p-formaldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst. In the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention, the content of the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene is preferably 0.5 to 15 parts by mass and more preferably 1 to 10 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the nonvolatile content of the radically polymerizable composition in order to form a cured product having a high refractive index. In particular, the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention, which includes the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) or the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene, preferably includes both the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene in order to provide a resin composition having a low viscosity and a high refractive index. In the present invention, the content of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A) is preferably 30 to 95 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass in total of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition that forms a cured product having a high refractive index. The content of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A) is more preferably 35 to 90 parts by mass in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition that forms a cured product having good releasability. In order to provide a radically polymerizable composition having a lower viscosity, the content of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A) is preferably 45 to 85 parts by mass and more preferably 55 to 80. In the present invention, the content of the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) is preferably 5 to 70 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass in total of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition that forms a cured product having a high refractive index. The content of the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) is preferably 10 to 60 parts by mass in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition that forms a cured product having higher heat resistance. The content of the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) is preferably 15 to 55 parts by mass in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition having a lower viscosity. In the present invention, the content of the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene is preferably 0.5 to 15 parts by mass and more preferably 1 to 10 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass in total of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition that forms a cured product having a high refractive index. In the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention, the total mass of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene is preferably 15 to 100 parts by mass, more preferably 25 to 95 parts by mass, and further preferably 35 to 80 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the nonvolatile content of the radically polymerizable composition in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition having a high refractive index and a low viscosity. In the case where the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention includes the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis(acryloylmethyl)biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene, these compounds may be simultaneously produced by a single reaction. Such a radically polymerizable composition is, for example, a radically polymerizable composition produced by reacting biphenyl, a hydrogen halide, and a formaldehyde derivative with one another to prepare a reaction mixture and further reacting the reaction mixture with acrylic acid or an alkali metal acrylate. This radically polymerizable composition may include, as a by-product of the reaction, a compound other than the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), or the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene. In this case, the total mass of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene is preferably 50 to 95 parts by mass and more preferably 65 to 80 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the composition in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition having a higher hardness and a lower viscosity. A specific example of the method for simultaneously producing a radical resin composition including the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis(acryloylmethyl)biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene by a single reaction is as follows. Biphenyl, a hydrogen halide, and a formaldehyde derivative are caused to react with one another in the presence of an acid catalyst to prepare a mixture including the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene, biphenyl, a methylchloro compound of biphenyl. Then, the methylchloro compound of biphenyl included in the mixture is caused to react with acrylic acid or an alkali metal acrylate to prepare a mixture including the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A) and the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B). In the case where the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis(acryloylmethyl)biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene are produced by the method described above, the content ratio of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene can be controlled as needed by changing the amount of the formaldehyde derivative used in the reaction or by changing the types or amounts of the acid catalyst and an organic acid. Specifically, the amount of formaldehyde used is preferably 1 to 25 moles and more preferably 1.5 to 5 moles relative to 1 mole of biphenyl in order to easily control the content ratio to be within the preferred range described above. Examples of the formaldehyde derivative include formalin, para-formaldehyde, and trioxane. The molar ratio of the hydrogen halide used relative to biphenyl is preferably excessively high. Examples of the hydrogen halide include concentrated hydrochloric acid and hydrogen chloride gas. Examples of the acid catalyst used in the reaction include sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid, trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, monochloroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and Lewis acids such as zinc chloride. In the reaction, an organic solvent such as dimethoxyethane, dioxane, cyclopentyl methyl ether, or acetic acid may be used. The reaction temperature is preferably 60° C. to 180° C. and more preferably 70° C. to 120° C. The reaction time is preferably 3 to 60 hours and more preferably 15 to 45 hours. In the case where the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis(acryloylmethyl)biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene are produced by the method described above, biphenyl may remain in the composition as an unreacted raw material. In this case, in the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention, the content of biphenyl is preferably 0.5 to 15 parts by mass and more preferably 1 to 10 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the nonvolatile content of the radically polymerizable composition in order to provide a composition having a high refractive index and a low viscosity, which are the intended effects of the present invention. The content of each component contained in the radically polymerizable composition produced by the method described above is measured by, for example, capillary gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, or gel permeation chromatography. Specifically, the chromatography may be performed using a capillary column such as “HP-1” produced by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (liquid phase: 100% dimethylpolysiloxane) by increasing the temperature from 50° C. to 325° C. The degree of polymerization of the biphenyl compound (C) contained in the product is determined by, for example, the following method. Silica gel column chromatography is performed to remove the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A) and the bis(acryloylmethyl)biphenyl (B). The remaining components are analyzed using a gas-chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) or a high-performance liquid-chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS). In addition to the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C), the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention may include a (meth)acrylate compound (Y) having a fluorene skeleton in its molecular structure in combination. The (meth)acrylate compound (Y) having a fluorene skeleton in its molecular structure has a high refractive index, but on the other hand, it has a considerably high viscosity or is solid at ordinary temperature. For example, the compound represented by general formula (1) below has a refractive index of 1.617 at 40° C. and is solid at ordinary temperature. A composition including the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B) or the biphenyl compound (C) having a molecular structure in which biphenyl structures are bonded to each other through a methylene, which are included in the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention as essential components, has a low viscosity and a high refractive index as described above. Therefore, when these compounds are used in combination with the (meth)acrylate compound (Y) having a fluorene skeleton in its molecular structure, a radically polymerizable synthetic composition having a low viscosity can be produced while taking advantage of the high refractive index of the (meth)acrylate compound (Y) having a fluorene skeleton in its molecular structure. An example of the (meth)acrylate compound (Y) having a fluorene skeleton in its molecular structure used in the present invention is a compound having a fluorene skeleton or a diphenylfluorene skeleton; and at least one (meth)acryloyl group. The number of the fluorene skeletons or the diphenylfluorene skeletons in the molecular structure may be one or two or more. Specific examples of the (meth)acrylate compound (Y) having a fluorene skeleton in its molecular structure used in the present invention include compounds represented by general formulae (2) to (7) below. [In general formula (2), X is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group; R1 and R4 are independently a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having a carbon number of 1 to 3; R2 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; R3 is a direct bond or a methylene group; and m is an integer of 0 to 5.] [In general formula (3), two X's are independently a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group; two R1's are independently a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having a carbon number of 1 to 3; two R2's are independently a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; two R3's are independently a direct bond or a methylene group; and m and n are independently an integer of 0 to 5.] [In general formula (4), two X's are independently a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group; two R1's are independently a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having a carbon number of 1 to 3; R2 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; and m and n are independently an integer of 0 to 5.] [In general formula (5), two X's are independently a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group; two R1's are independently a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having a carbon number of 1 to 3; two R2's are independently a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; and m and n are independently an integer of 0 to 5.] [In general formula (6), two R1's are independently a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having a carbon number of 1 to 3; two R2's are independently a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; two R3's are independently a hydrocarbon group having an carbon number of 1 to 6; two R4's are independently a cyano group, a halogen atom, or an alkyl group having a carbon number of 1 to 3; two a's are independently an integer of 1 to 4; two b's are independently an integer of 0 to 4; and m and n are independently an integer of 0 to 5.] [In general formula (7), one of two R1's is a hydroxyl group, and the other is an oxy(meth)acryloyl group; and one of two R1's is a hydroxyl group, and the other is an oxy(meth)acryloyl group.] The (meth)acrylate compound (Y) having a fluorene skeleton in its molecular structure may be used alone or in combination of two or more. In particular, a (meth)acrylate compound having a diphenylfluorene skeleton in its molecular structure, such as a compound represented by any one of general formulae (4) to (7), is preferable in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition having a higher refractive index. In order to provide a radically polymerizable composition having a lower viscosity, a (meth)acrylate compound having one diphenylfluorene skeleton in its molecular structure, such as a compound represented by any one of general formulae (4) to (6) is more preferable, and a compound represented by general formula (5) is particularly preferable.

In addition to the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C), the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention may include, in combination, a (meth)acrylate compound (Z) other than the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), or the (meth)acrylate compound (Y) having a fluorene skeleton.

These compounds may be used alone or in combination of two or more. In particular, benzyl (meth)acrylate, phenoxyethyl (meth)acrylate, phenylphenoxyethyl acrylate, di(meth)acrylate of an ethylene oxide adduct of bisphenol A, and di(meth)acrylate of a propylene oxide adduct of bisphenol A are preferable in order to provide a radically polymerizable composition having a higher refractive index. In the case where the radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention includes the (meth)acrylate compound (Z), the total mass of the phenylbenzyl (meth)acrylate (A), the bis[(meth)acryloylmethyl]biphenyl (B), and the biphenyl compound (C) is preferably 25 to 95 parts by mass and more preferably 35 to 80 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the nonvolatile content of the radically polymerizable composition in order to provide a composition having a high refractive index and a low viscosity, which are the intended effects of the present invention.

The composition is applied onto a substrate or formed into shape depending on its intended purpose and use, and subsequently irradiated with an active energy ray or heated. In the case where the composition is cured by being irradiated with an active energy ray, such an active energy ray is, for example, an electron beam, an ultraviolet ray, or visible light. In the case where an electron beam is used as the active energy ray, the curable composition according to the present invention may be cured using, for example, a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator, a Van de Graaff electron accelerator, a resonant transformer accelerator, or an electron beam generator of an insulated-core-transformer type, a Dynamitron type, a linear-filament type, or a high-frequency type. In the case where an ultraviolet ray is used as the active energy ray, the composition may be cured by being irradiated using a mercury lamp such as an ultrahigh-pressure mercury lamp, a high-pressure mercury lamp, or a low-pressure mercury lamp, a xenon lamp, carbon arc, a metal height lamp, a high-power LED-UV lamp, or the like. In this case, the amount of ultraviolet ray exposure is preferably 0.1 to 1000 mJ/cm2. When the composition is cured by being heated, it can be cured by being heated in the temperature range of 60° C. to 250° C. The refractive index of a cured product formed of the radically curable resin composition according to the present invention is preferably 1.610 or more, more preferably 1.620 or more, and further preferably 1.630 or more. When the refractive index is less than 1.610, such a refractive index is insufficient for use in optical materials. [Applications] The radically polymerizable composition according to the present invention described above in detail can be suitably used for plastic lenses such as an eyeglass lens, a digital camera lens, a Fresnel lens, and a prism lens; and various optical materials such as an optical over-coating agent, a hard coating agent, an antireflection film, an optical fiber, an optical waveguide, a hologram, a prism lens, an LED seal material, and a solar-battery coating material. Among these applications, in particular, the radically polymerizable composition can be suitably used for plastic lens and particularly useful as a prism lens for liquid crystal substrates because the radically polymerizable composition forms a cured product having a high refractive index, high heat resistance, and high moisture resistance. The prism lens for liquid crystal substrates is a sheet-shaped lens that includes a plurality of fine prismatic portions formed on one surface of a sheet-shaped molded body. Ordinary, the sheet-shaped lens is disposed on a back surface (light-source side) of a liquid crystal display element so that the prism plane faces the liquid crystal display element. Furthermore, a light-guiding sheet is disposed on the back surface of the sheet-shaped lens, or the prism lens also functions as the light-guiding sheet. Regarding the shape of the prismatic portions of the prism lens, the prism apex angle θ is preferably 70° to 110°, more preferably 75° to 100°, and particularly preferably 80° to 95° in order to achieve good light-condensing property and to improve luminance. The pitch of the prism is preferably 100 μm or less and particularly preferably 70 μm or less to prevent the formation of a moiré pattern on a screen and to further improve the definition of the screen. The difference between the depressions and projections of the prismatic portions is determined depending on the prism apex angle θ and the pitch of the prismatic portions, and is preferably 50 μm or less. The sheet thickness of the prism lens is preferably as large as possible from the viewpoint of strength, but is preferably as small as possible from an optical viewpoint in order to reduce the absorption of light. In order to achieve a good balance, the sheet thickness is preferably 50 to 1000 μm. The prism lens is produced from the composition according to the present invention by, for example, the following method. The composition is applied to a forming die such as a metal die or resin die having a prism pattern formed therein. The surface of the composition is smoothed and then a transparent substrate is superposed thereonto. The composition is cured by being irradiated with an active energy ray. The transparent substrate is not particularly limited as long as it has high transparency and preferably has a thickness of 3 mm or less in views of active-energy ray permeability, ease of handling, etc. Examples of material of the transparent substrate include synthesis resins such as an acrylic resin, a polycarbonate resin, a polyester resin, a polystyrene resin, a fluorine resin, a polyimide resin, and a mixture of these polymers; and glass. The prism sheet formed on the transparent substrate by the above-described method may be directly used or may be used as prismatic portions alone after the transparent substrate is removed. When the prism sheet is used without removing the transparent substrate from the prismatic portions, an adhesiveness-improving treatment such as a primer treatment is preferably performed on the surface of the transparent substrate since it is important to improve the adhesiveness between the prism lens and the transparent substrate from the viewpoints of weather resistance and durability. In the case where the transparent substrate is removed, a surface treatment with a silicone-based or fluorine-based release agent is preferably performed on the surface of the transparent substrate because it is preferable to relatively easily remove the transparent substrate.

A reaction was conducted for 30 hours. Immediately after the completion of the reaction, a lower layer was removed from the reaction solution, and 2.3 kg of toluene was added into an organic layer. The organic layer was then washed with 400 g of a 12.5% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, and distilled water. The organic layer was distilled off to prepare 908 g of a chloro intermediate in the form of a white solid. Acryloylation Nine hundred and eight grams of the intermediate prepared above was dissolved in 1603 g of DMF serving as a reaction solvent.

Example 1 Blend of Radically Polymerizable Composition A radically polymerizable composition (1) was prepared by mixing 100 parts by mass of the mixture (1) prepared in Production Example 6 with 4 parts by mass of a photopolymerization initiator (“Irgacure 184” produced by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc.). Production of Cured Film The radically polymerizable composition (1) prepared as described above was applied onto a chrome-plated metal sheet. A transparent PET film having an untreated surface was superposed onto a layer formed of the composition. The thickness of the layer formed of the composition was adjusted to 50 μm. The layer formed of the composition was cured by being irradiated with 500 mJ/cm2 of ultraviolet ray using a high-pressure mercury lamp from the transparent-substrate side. Thus, a layered body was prepared. The cured layer formed of the radically polymerizable composition was removed from the metal sheet and the transparent PET film of the layered body. Thus, a cured film was prepared. Production of Cured Film with PET Substrate A layered body was prepared as in Production of cured film described above, except that a transparent PET film having a surface adhesive-treated was used instead of the transparent PET film having an untreated surface. Only the metal sheet was removed from the layered body. Thus, a cured film with a PET substrate was prepared.

Fair: Changes in hue were observed, but no change in shape was observed. Poor: Changes in hue and shape were observed. Evaluation 5: Releasability Test The radically polymerizable composition (1) prepared as described above was applied onto a chrome-plated prism-forming metal die. A transparent PET film having an untreated surface was superposed onto the layer formed of the composition, and the thickness of the layer formed of the composition was adjusted to 50 μm. The layer formed of the composition was cured by being irradiated with 500 mJ/cm2 of ultraviolet ray using a high-pressure mercury lamp from the transparent-substrate side. An evaluation was conducted on the basis of the presence or absence of the cured product remaining on the metal die when a cured layer formed of the radically polymerizable composition was removed from the prism-forming metal die.
