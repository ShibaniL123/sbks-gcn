Example 19A
Methyl 1-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3-(2-phenylethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate
3.30 g (8.50 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 15A were suspended in 125 ml of dichloromethane, and 7.4 ml (85.0 mmol) of oxalyl chloride were added dropwise, as was one drop of DMF. After 2 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness. The residue obtained was dissolved again in 75 ml of dichloromethane, and 8.6 ml (212 mmol) of methanol were added. After the reaction mixture had been stirred at RT for about 18 h, it was concentrated to dryness again and the residue was chromatographed using a silica gel cartridge (Biotage, 100 g of silica gel, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 5:1â†’1:1). After combination of the product fractions, concentration and drying under high vacuum, 3.35 g (97% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
