This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/778,961, filed Mar. 13, 2013, entitled “Artificial Nucleic Acids,” the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND This disclosure pertains to artificial nucleic acids and, more particularly, to artificial nucleic acid backbones which do not hybridize well to DNA or RNA, as well as their production and uses, including for diagnostic and chemotherapeutic purposes. For about the last 20 years, a number of nucleic acid analogues have been synthesized to modify or improve nucleic acid hybridization characteristics. The properties of the nucleic acid analogues can be classified as those which hybridize to natural nucleic acids and those that hybridize only to themselves and not to natural nucleic acids. Peptide nucleic acids exhibit strong hybridization with DNA and RNA (Nielsen et al, Science 254: 1497-1500 (1991) and similarly locked nucleic acids show increased stability and discrimination properties when hybridized to nucleic acids (Koshkin et al, Tetrahedron 54: 3607-3630 (1998)). Other nucleic acid analogues with DNA and RNA binding properties include pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (Vilaivan et al, Artificial DNA; PNA & XNA, 2: 50-59 (2011)). Pyranosyl nucleic acid (p-RNA), and 3-deoxypyranosyl nucleic acid (p-DNA) are polymers that preferentially pair with complementary pRNA or pDNA versus natural DNA and RNA sequences (Schlonvogt et al. Helv. Chim. Acta 79, 2316 (1996), Ashkerman et al. Helv. Chim., Acta 85, 1443-1462 (2002)). Pentopyranosyl nucleic acid preparation and use for the production of a therapeutic, diagnostic and/or electronic component has been described (U.S. Pat. No. 6,506,896, U.S. Pat. No. 7,153,955). Acyclic phosphodiester nucleic acid backbones have been disclosed, for example, for GNA (Zang et al.), aTNA (Asanuma et al., J. Am Chem Soc., 132: 14702-14703 (2010) and UNA (Peterson et al., Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry, 9(10):3591-3597 (2011). The (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of glycol nucleic acid (GNA) do not cross-pair with each other or with DNA: however. (S)-GNA cross-pairs with RNA (Johnson et al., J. Org. Chem., 76:7964-74 (2011): Zhang et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 127: 4174-4175 (2005)). Benzene-phosphate backbone (Ueno et al., Nucl. Acids Symposium Series., 51: 293-294 (2007)) is another preferably self-hybridizing backbone. A number of purine and pyrimidine acyclic nucleosides were disclosed and tested as antivirals (Guillarme et al., Tetrahedron, 59: 2177-2184(2003)). Depurination is the cleavage of the glycosidic bond connecting the purine base to sugar during oligonucleotides synthesis and during the synthesis of the purine phosphoramidites. Limitation of depurination requires special protecting groups and reaction conditions (Froehler and Matteucci. Nucl. Acids Res., 11: 8031-8036 (1983). McBride et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 108: 2040-2048 (1986)). For these reasons, it is therefore desirable to utilize artificial nucleic acids that lack the glycosidic bond. The design of multiple nucleic acid sequences with the same Tm poses special challenges for use in applications such as microarrays and nano-fabrications. It is essential to prevent undesired hybridizations. It is also required that multiple nucleic acid sequences need to be designed that do not hybridize non-specifically with each other (Tanaka et al., Nucl. Acids. Res., 33: 903-911(2005)). These so-called orthogonal nucleic acids can be designed as described in U.S. Application Publication No. 2012/0015358. The orthogonal nucleic acids with low affinity for DNA or/and not recognizable by DNA processing enzymes can be especially useful for labeling, barcoding or anchoring of multiple DNA-containing substrates co-existing in one mixture or on one array. SUMMARY The present disclosure relates to artificial nucleosides, or nucleoside analogues, and nucleotides and oligonucleotides formed from these artificial nucleoside monomer units, and to oligonucleotides formed from artificial nucleoside monomer units in which one or more of the units is functionalized, and to the use of these novel compositions for diagnostic and chemotherapeutic purposes. The preferred artificial nucleosides can be characterized as 2-((nucleobase)methyl)butane-1,3-diols. Four different stereoisomers of the nucleoside analogues are possible. The nucleoside analogues can form oligomers that can include one or more phosphodiester bonds. Oligomers made up of the nucleoside analogues can also be utilized to form conjugates with oligomers having a natural nucleic acid backbone, different non-natural backbones, peptides, and the like.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS I. General The nucleoside analogues of the present disclosure can be generally represented by the following Formulas I and II: wherein B is a nucleic acid base which may be natural or artificial, X is —CH2— or substituted carbon, and n is 1 or 2. Preferred nucleoside analogues can be represented by the formulas shown below: wherein B is a nucleic acid base which may be natural or artificial. The preferred R,R stereoisomer of the nucleosides, when incorporated into oligonucleotides, forms homoduplexes of greater stability than DNA oligonucleotides of the same sequences. Oligonucleotides made up of the preferred R,R stereoisomer nucleosides demonstrate a reduced ability to hybridize to DNA to form heteroduplexes. Oligonucleotides made up of the preferred S,S stereoisomer nucleosides, the mirror image of the R,R steroisomers, demonstrate no ability to hybridize to DNA to form heteroduplexes because their orientation within the nucleic acid backbone is “left-handed” compared to a natural nucleic acid backbone. Furthermore, oligomers synthesized with the S,S steroisomers have the same self-hybridizing properties as the mirror image oligomers containing the R,R backbone. II. General Synthesis 2-((Nucleobase)methyl)butane-1,3-diols were generally prepared by Mitsunobu condensation of properly protected stereochemically pure 2-(hydroxymethyl)butane-1,3-diols with nucleobases or base precursors. Four different stereoisomers of such nucleosides are possible (FIG. 1). The (R,R)-nucleosides were prepared starting from known (2R,3R)-2-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)butan-1-ol (4, FIG. 2) (W. H. Ham et al. J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 8372-8374). The alcohol was condensed with thymine in the presence of triphenylphosphine and diisopropylazodicarboxylate to give protected nucleoside 5, which was then fully deprotected by a BCl3 treatment to yield thymidine 6. DMT-protection of the primary hydroxyl followed with phosphitylation of the secondary hydroxyl group afforded thymidine phosphoramidite 8. To make the respective adenine analogue (FIG. 2), the alcohol 4 was, first, tosylated, and the resulting tosylate 9 was reacted with cesium salt of adenine generating protected adenosine 10. Hydrogenation to remove the benzyl protection followed by benzoylation of the exocyclic gave intermediate 12. DMT protection of the primary hydroxyl group and deprotection of the secondary hydroxyl with tetrabutylammonium fluoride yielded DMT-protected N-benzoyl adenosine 14. Standard phosphitylation of the secondary hydroxyl afforded 2-cyanoethyl diisopropylphosphoramidite 15 completing the synthesis in 21% overall yield starting from 4. To make a cytosine analogue with the same nucleic acid backbone structure, the alcohol 4 was, first, converted to protected uracil 16 (FIG. 3). Debenzoylation to 17 followed by activation of the 4 position of uracil via the formation of the triazo intermediate 18 and reaction with ammonia gave protected cytidine 19. The protecting groups of 19 were removed by a treatment with BCl3 to give fully deprotected cytidine 20. The exocyclic aminogroup of 20 was selectively acetylated to yield N-acetylcytidine 21, which was then protected by the DMT group and phosphitylated to afford cytidine phosphoramidite 23. The guanosine phosphoramidite 29 was prepared from the alcohol 4 in 6 steps in 33% overall yield (FIG. 3). The Mitsunobu condensation of 4 with 2-amino-6-chloropurine gave 2-amino-6-chloropurine nucleoside intermediate 24. Treatment with aqueous TFA replaced the chloro group with a hydroxyl group simultaneously removing the TBDMS protection. The resulting guanosine analogue 25 was protected at the exocyclic amine with a DMF group and hydrogenated to remove the benzyl protection freeing the primary hydroxyl. Standard DMT protection of 27 and phosphitylation of 28 completed the synthesis of guanosine phosphoramidite 29. The starting alcohol 4 was also used to produce the (S,R) versions of 2-((nucleobase)methyl)butane-1,3-diols. It was sequentially protected with a TBDMS group and debenzylated to afford alcohol 31, starting material for the (S,R) nucleosides. The thymidine nucleoside 32 was obtained by Mitsunobu condensation of 31 with N-benzoylthymine. A treatment with TBAF removed both the TBDMS and benzoyl groups releasing the fully deprotected thymidine 33. DMT protection of the primary and phosphitylation of the secondary hydroxyls afforded 2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite 35. The respective guanosine nucleoside phosphoramidite 40 (FIG. 4) was prepared similarly to its (R,R) analogue except that it did not require the hydrogenation step for debenzylation. So was the case with the cytidine analogue 48. The adenosine phosphoramidite 54 was synthesized in 7 steps. This time the initial condensation step was done using the Mitsunobu conditions, as oppose to alkylation using an activated tosylate in case of the (R,R) isomer (FIG. 2), using alcohol 31 and 6-chloropurine. The resulting chloropurine nucleoside 49 was aminated with ammonia (compound 50), benzoylated at the resulting exocyclic amine (compound 51) and reacted with TBAF to deblock the hydroxyl groups and yield N-benzoyl adenosine 52. Dimethoxytritylation (53) and the subsequent phosphitylation afforded the desired phosphoramidite 54. A combination of the methods utilized to synthesize the (R,R) and (R,S) nucleosides was also used to synthesize the respective (S,S) stereoisomers of A, T, C and G nucleosides of general structure I starting from the (2S,3S) stereoisomer of compound 4. It has been shown that the (S,S) version of this nucleic acid backbone provides oligomers that form stable duplexes with complementary sequences of the same backbone (FIG. 7) but do not hybridize to natural DNA (FIG. 8). As expected, melting temperatures of the (S,S)-based and (R,R)-configured duplexes were essentially identical (FIG. 7). Cyclopentane-based nucleic acid monomers of the general structure II (X═—CH2—, n=1) have also been synthesized. This structure can be viewed as a locked (with a —CH2— bridging group) version of the nucleic acid backbone of structure I. The T and A nucleosides were prepared by Mitsunobu condensation of the suitably protected stereochemically pure (hydroxymethyl)cyclopentanediol 55, which had been prepared from penten-1-one as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0251387, with a protected nucleobase (FIG. 10) or a base precursor (FIG. 11). The T monomer (compound 59) was further furnished by removing the transient trityl and silyl protections from the primary and secondary hydroxyls and installing respective DMT and phosphoramidite groups. Analogously, the A monomer after having been aminated and protected was converted to the DMT phosphoramidite of structure 65. The G and C monomers can be prepared by combination of the methods shown in FIGS. 3, 10 and 11. The methods described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2011/0251387, incorporated by reference, in combination with the known Mutsunobu-based stereo inversion of secondary hydroxyl group and the methods described herein provide synthetic routes to all 8 possible stereo configurations of nucleosides of Formula II (X═—CH2—, n=1) above. Cyclohexane-based nucleic acid monomers of the general structure II wherein X═—CH2— and n=2 can be synthesized analogously using cyclohexen-1-one in place of cyclopenten-1-one as the starting material.
