Moreover, the present invention relates to a certain DPP-4 inhibitor for use in treating, preventing or reducing the risk of skin necrosis, particularly associated with or induced by infusions or injections, e.g. of a GLP-1 receptor agonist, insulin or insulin analogue or other drugs administered subcutaneously and/or via needle or syringe, typically pierced through the skin. Further, the present invention relates to the DPP-4 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 receptor agonists, each as defined herein, for use in the combination therapies as described herein. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a common chronic and progressive disease arising from a complex pathophysiology involving the dual endocrine effects of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion with the consequence not meeting the required demands to maintain plasma glucose levels in the normal range. This leads to chronic hyperglycaemia and its associated micro- and macrovascular complications or chronic damages, such as e.g. diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy or neuropathy, or macrovascular (e.g. cardio- or cerebro-vascular) complications. The vascular disease component plays a significant role, but is not the only factor in the spectrum of diabetes associated disorders. The high frequency of complications leads to a significant reduction of life expectancy. Diabetes is currently the most frequent cause of adult-onset loss of vision, renal failure, and amputation in the Industrialised World because of diabetes induced complications and is associated with a two to five fold increase in cardiovascular disease risk. Furthermore, diabetes (particularly type 2 diabetes) is often coexistent and interrelated with obesity and these two conditions together impose a particularly complex therapeutic challenge. Because of the effects of obesity on insulin resistance, weight loss and its maintainance is an important therapeutic objective in overweight or obese individuals with prediabetes, metabolic syndrome or diabetes. Studies have been demonstrated that weight reduction in subjects with type 2 diabetes is associated with descreased insulin resistance, improved measures of glycemia and lipemia, and reduced blood pressure. Maintainance of weight reduction over longer term is considered to improve glycemic control and prevent diabetic complications (e.g. reduction of risk for cardiovascular diseases or events). Thus, weight loss is recommended for all overweight or obese indivuduals who have or are at risk for diabetes. However, obese patients with type 2 diabetes have much greater difficulty losing weight and maintain the reduced weight than the general non-diabetic population. Overweight may be defined as the condition wherein the individual has a body mass index (BMI) greater than or 25 kg/m2 and less than 30 kg/m2. The terms “overweight” and “pre-obese” are used interchangeably. Obesity may be defined as the condition wherein the individual has a BMI equal to or greater than 30 kg/m2. According to a WHO definition the term obesity may be categorized as follows: class I obesity is the condition wherein the BMI is equal to or greater than 30 kg/m2 but lower than 35 kg/m2; class II obesity is the condition wherein the BMI is equal to or greater than 35 kg/m2 but lower than 40 kg/m2; class III obesity is the condition wherein the BMI is equal to or greater than 40 kg/m2. Obesity may include e.g. visceral or abdominal obesity. Visceral obesity may be defined as the condition wherein a waist-to-hip ratio of greater than or equal to 1.0 in men and 0.8 in women is measured. It defines the risk for insulin resistance and the development of pre-diabetes. Abdominal obesity may usually be defined as the condition wherein the waist circumference is >40 inches or 102 cm in men, and is >35 inches or 94 cm in women. With regard to a Japanese ethnicity or Japanese patients abdominal obesity may be defined as waist circumference≧85 cm in men and ≧90 cm in women (see e.g. investigating committee for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in Japan). Diabetes patients within the meaning of this invention may include patients having obesity or overweight. Obesity patients within the meaning of this invention may include, in one embodiment, patients with diabetes (particularly having type 2 diabetes). Obesity patients within the meaning of this invention may include, in another embodiment, patients without diabetes (particularly without type 1 or type 2 diabetes). The treatment of type 2 diabetes typically begins with diet and exercise, followed by oral antidiabetic monotherapy, and although conventional monotherapy may initially control blood glucose in some patients, it is however associated with a high secondary failure rate. The limitations of single-agent therapy for maintaining glycemic control may be overcome, at least in some patients, and for a limited period of time by combining multiple drugs to achieve reductions in blood glucose that cannot be sustained during long-term therapy with single agents. Available data support the conclusion that in most patients with type 2 diabetes current monotherapy will fail and treatment with multiple drugs will be required. But, because type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, even patients with good initial responses to conventional combination therapy will eventually require an increase of the dosage or further treatment with insulin because the blood glucose level is very difficult to maintain stable for a long period of time. Although existing combination therapy has the potential to enhance glycemic control, it is not without limitations (especially with regard to long term efficacy). Further, traditional therapies may show an increased risk for side effects, such as hypoglycemia or weight gain, which may compromise their efficacy and acceptability. Thus, for many patients, these existing drug therapies result in progressive deterioriation in metabolic control despite treatment and do not sufficiently control metabolic status especially over long-term and thus fail to achieve and to maintain glycemic control in advanced or late stage type 2 diabetes, including diabetes with inadequate glycemic control despite conventional oral or non-oral antidiabetic medication. Therefore, although intensive treatment of hyperglycemia can reduce the incidence of chronic damages, many patients with type 2 diabetes remain inadequately treated, partly because of limitations in long term efficacy, tolerability and dosing inconvenience of conventional antihyperglycemic therapies. In addition, obesity, overweight or weight gain (e.g. as side or adverse effect of some conventional antidiabetic medications) further complicates the treatment of diabetes and its micorvascular or macrovascular complications. This high incidence of therapeutic failure is a major contributor to the high rate of long-term hyperglycemia-associated complications or chronic damages (including micro- and makrovascular complications such as e.g. diabetic nephrophathy, retinopathy or neuropathy, or cardiovascular complications) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Oral antidiabetic drugs conventionally used in therapy (such as e.g. first- or second-line, and/or mono- or (initial or add-on) combination therapy) include, without being restricted thereto, metformin, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, glinides and α-glucosidase inhibitors. Non-oral (typically injected) antidiabetic drugs conventionally used in therapy (such as e.g. first- or second-line, and/or mono- or (initial or add-on) combination therapy) include, without being restricted thereto, GLP-1 or GLP-1 analogues, and insulin or insulin analogues. However, the use of these conventional antidiabetic or antihyperglycemic agents can be associated with various adverse effects. For example, metformin can be associated with lactic acidosis or gastrointestinal side effects; sulfonylureas, glinides and insulin or insulin analogues can be associated with hypoglycemia and weight gain; thiazolidinediones can be associated with edema, bone fracture, weight gain and heart failure/cardiac effects; and alpha-glucosidase blockers and GLP-1 or GLP-1 analogues can be associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects (e.g. dyspepsia, flatulence or diarrhea, or nausea or vomiting) and, most seriously (but rare), pancreatitis. Therefore, it remains a need in the art to provide efficacious, safe and tolerable antidiabetic therapies, particularly for obese or overweight diabetes patients. Further, it remains a need in the art to provide efficacious, safe and tolerable therapies for obesity patients with or without diabetes, particularly for reducing body weight and maintaining reduced body weight as well as for preventing rebound of weight gain following cessation of weight loss treatment in such patients. Within the management of the dual epidemic of type 2 diabetes and obesity (“diabesity”), it is an objective to find therapies which are safe, tolerable and effective in the treatment or prevention of these conditions together, particularly in achieving long term weight reduction and improving glycemic control. Further, within the therapy of type 2 diabetes, obesity or both, it is a need for treating the condition effectively, avoiding the complications inherent to the condition, and delaying disease progression. Furthermore, it remains a need that antidiabetic treatments not only prevent the long-term complications often found in advanced stages of diabetes disease, but also are a therapeutic option in those diabetes patients who have developed complications, such as renal impairment. Moreover, it remains a need to provide prevention or reduction of risk for adverse effects associated with conventional antidiabetic therapies. The enzyme DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) also known as CD26 is a serine protease known to lead to the cleavage of a dipeptide from the N-terminal end of a number of proteins having at their N-terminal end a prolin or alanin residue. Due to this property DPP-4 inhibitors interfere with the plasma level of bioactive peptides including the peptide GLP-1 and are considered to be promising drugs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. For example, DPP-4 inhibitors and their uses are disclosed in WO 2002/068420, WO 2004/018467, WO 2004/018468, WO 2004/018469, WO 2004/041820, WO 2004/046148, WO 2005/051950, WO 2005/082906, WO 2005/063750, WO 2005/085246, WO 2006/027204, WO 2006/029769, WO2007/014886; WO 2004/050658, WO 2004/111051, WO 2005/058901, WO 2005/097798; WO 2006/068163, WO 2007/071738, WO 2008/017670; WO 2007/128721, WO 2007/128724, WO 2007/128761, or WO 2009/121945. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormon secreted from enteroendocrine L cells of the intestine in response to food. Exogenous GLP-1 administration at pharmacological doses results in effects that are beneficial for treating type 2 diabetes. However, native GLP-1 is subject to rapid enzymatic degradation. The action of GLP-1 is mediated through the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). In the monitoring of the treatment of diabetes mellitus the HbA1c value, the product of a non-enzymatic glycation of the haemoglobin B chain, is of exceptional importance. As its formation depends essentially on the blood sugar level and the life time of the erythrocytes the HbA1c in the sense of a “blood sugar memory” reflects the average blood sugar level of the preceding 4-12 weeks. Diabetic patients whose HbA1c level has been well controlled over a long time by more intensive diabetes treatment (i.e. <6.5% of the total haemoglobin in the sample) are significantly better protected from diabetic microangiopathy. The available treatments for diabetes can give the diabetic an average improvement in their HbA1c level of the order of 1.0-1.5%. This reduction in the HbA1C level is not sufficient in all diabetics to bring them into the desired target range of <7.0%, preferably <6.5% and more preferably <6% HbA1c. Within the meaning of this invention, inadequate or insufficient glycemic control means in particular a condition wherein patients show HbA1c values above 6.5%, in particular above 7.0%, even more preferably above 7.5%, especially above 8%. An embodiment of patients with inadequate or insufficient glycemic control include, without being limited to, patients having a HbA1c value from 7.5 to 10% (or, in another embodiment, from 7.5 to 11%). A special sub-embodiment of inadequately controlled patients refers to patients with poor glycemic control including, without being limited, patients having a HbA1c value 9%. Within glycemic control, in addition to improvement of the HbA1c level, other recommended therapeutic goals for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients are improvement of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and of postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels to normal or as near normal as possible. Recommended desired target ranges of preprandial (fasting) plasma glucose are 70-130 mg/dL (or 90-130 mg/dL) or <110 mg/dL, and of two-hour postprandial plasma glucose are <180 mg/dL or <140 mg/dL. In one embodiment, diabetes patients within the meaning of this invention may include patients who have not previously been treated with an antidiabetic drug (drug-naïve patients). Thus, in an embodiment, the therapies described herein may be used in naïve patients. In another embodiment, diabetes patients within the meaning of this invention may include patients with advanced or late stage type 2 diabetes mellitus (including patients with failure to conventional antidiabetic therapy), such as e.g. patients with inadequate glycemic control on one, two or more conventional oral and/or non-oral antidiabetic drugs as defined herein, such as e.g. patients with insufficient glycemic control despite (mono-) therapy with metformin, a thiazolidinedione (particularly pioglitazone), a sulphonylurea, a glinide, GLP-1 or GLP-1 analogue, insulin or insulin analogue, or an α-glucosidase inhibitor, or despite dual combination therapy with metformin/sulphonylurea, metformin/thiazolidinedione (particularly pioglitazone), metformin/insulin, pioglitazone/sulphonylurea, pioglitazone/insulin, or sulphonylurea/insulin. Thus, in an embodiment, the therapies described herein may be used in patients experienced with therapy, e.g. with conventional oral and/or non-oral antidiabetic mono- or dual or triple combination medication as mentioned herein. A further embodiment of diabetic patients within the meaning of this invention refers to patients ineligible for metformin therapy including patients for whom metformin therapy is contraindicated, e.g. patients having one or more contraindications against metformin therapy according to label, such as for example patients with at least one contraindication selected from: renal disease, renal impairment or renal dysfunction (e.g., as specified by product information of locally approved metformin),dehydration,unstable or acute congestive heart failure,acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, andhereditary galactose intolerance; and patients who suffer from one or more intolerable side effects attributed to metformin, particularly gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin, such as for example patients suffering from at least one gastrointestinal side effect selected from: nausea,vomiting,diarrhoea,intestinal gas, andsevere abdominal discomfort. A further embodiment of the diabetes patients which may be amenable to the therapies of this invention may include, without being limited, those diabetes patients for whom normal metformin therapy is not appropriate, such as e.g. those diabetes patients who need reduced dose metformin therapy due to reduced tolerability, intolerability or contraindication against metformin or due to (mildly) impaired/reduced renal function (including elderly patients, such as e.g. ≧60-65 years). A further embodiment of diabetic patients within the meaning of this invention refers to patients having renal disease, renal dysfunction, or insufficiency or impairment of renal function (including mild, moderate and severe renal impairment), e.g. as suggested by elevated serum creatinine levels (e.g. serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age, e.g. ≧130-150 μmol/l, or ≧1.5 mg/dl 136 μmol/l) in men and ≧1.4 mg/dl (≧124 μmol/l) in women) or abnormal creatinine clearance (e.g. glomerular filtration rate (GFR)≦30-60 ml/min). In this context, for more detailed example, mild renal impairment may be e.g. suggested by a creatinine clearance of 50-80 ml/min (approximately corresponding to serum creatine levels of ≦1.7 mg/dL in men and ≦1.5 mg/dL in women); moderate renal impairment may be e.g. suggested by a creatinine clearance of 30-50 ml/min (approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of >1.7 to ≦3.0 mg/dL in men and >1.5 to ≦2.5 mg/dL in women); and severe renal impairment may be e.g. suggested by a creatinine clearance of <30 ml/min (approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of >3.0 mg/dL in men and >2.5 mg/dL in women). Patients with end-stage renal disease require dialysis (e.g. hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis). For other more detailed example, patients with renal disease, renal dysfunction or renal impairment include patients with chronic renal insufficiency or impairment, which can be stratified according to glomerular filtration rate (GFR, ml/min/1.73 m2) into 5 disease stages: stage 1 characterized by normal GFR 90 plus either persistent albuminuria or known structural or hereditary renal disease; stage 2 characterized by mild reduction of GFR (GFR 60-89) describing mild renal impairment; stage 3 characterized by moderate reduction of GFR (GFR 30-59) describing moderate renal impairment; stage 4 characterized by severe reduction of GFR (GFR 15-30) describing severe renal impairment; and terminal stage 5 characterized by requiring dialysis or GFR<15 describing established kidney failure (end-stage renal disease, ESRD). Within the scope of the present invention it has now been found that certain DPP-4 inhibitors as defined herein as well as pharmaceutical combinations, compositions or combined uses according to this invention of these DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g. exogenous GLP-1 or GLP-1 analogues) as defined herein have unexpected and particularly advantageous properties, which make them suitable for the purpose of this invention and/or for fulfilling one or more of above needs.

In alternative to the use of a GLP-1 receptor agonist (e.g. GLP-1 or GLP-1 analogue as defined herein), the initial weight and/or fat loss may also be induced by using diet, exercise and/or treatment with an anti-obesity or body weight reducing agent, such as e.g. one or more agents selected from sibutramine, a lipase inhibitor such as tetrahydrolipstatin (orlistat) or alizyme (cetilistat), a cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist (e.g. rimonabant), a MC4 receptor agonist, a NPY receptor agonist such as e.g. a NPY2 antagonist (e.g. velneperit), a 5HT2c receptor agonist (e.g. lorcaserin), a Ghrelin antagonist, Pyy 3-36, leptin, a DGAT-1 inhibitor, a noradrenaline-dopamine-5HT reuptake inhibitor (e.g. tesofensine), bupropion/naltrexone, bupropion/zonisamide, topiramate/phentermine and pramlintide/metreleptin; or a MCH antagonist, a CCK inhibitor, a FAS inhibitor, an ACC inhibitor, a SCD inhibitor, a beta3adrenoreceptor agonist, a MTP inhibitor (e.g. lomitapide) or amylin or an amylin analogue (e.g. davalintide or pramlintide). Within an embodiment of the combination therapy of this invention (e.g. for treating type 2 diabetes, obesity or both, or for reducing and maintaining body weight), the GLP-1 receptor agonist may be used for inducing (initial) body weight loss, and/or the DPP-4 inhibitor may be used for maintaining body weight loss. Another embodiment of the combination therapy of this invention (e.g. for treating type 2 diabetes, obesity or both, or for reducing and maintaining body weight and/or body fat), refers to a method comprising i) administering an effective amount of a GLP-1 receptor agonist to the patient, particularly for inducing body weight and/or body fat loss in the patient,ii) withdrawing the GLP-1 receptor agonist from the patient, particularly after the body weight and/or body fat is reduced in the patient, andiii) administering an effective amount of a DPP-4 inhibitor to the patient, particularly for delaying body weight and/or body fat gain and/or maintaining reduction in body weight and/or in body fat in the patient. Another embodiment of the combination therapy of this invention refers to the use of a certain DPP-4 inhibitor (particularly linagliptin) subsequent to body weight loss, particularly subsequent to a GLP-1 receptor agonist, optionally in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents. Other aspects of the present invention become apparent to the skilled person from the foregoing and following remarks (including the examples and claims). The aspects of the present invention, in particular the pharmaceutical compounds, compositions, combinations, methods and uses, refer to DPP-4 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 receptor agonists as defined hereinbefore and hereinafter. A DPP-4 inhibitor within the meaning of the present invention includes, without being limited to, any of those DPP-4 inhibitors mentioned hereinabove and hereinbelow, preferably orally active DPP-4 inhibitors. An embodiment of this invention refers to a DPP-4 inhibitor for use in the treatment and/or prevention of metabolic diseases (particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus) in type 2 diabetes patients, wherein said patients further suffering from renal disease, renal dysfunction or renal impairment, particularly characterized in that said DPP-4 inhibitor is administered to said patients in the same dose levels as to patients with normal renal function, thus e.g. said DPP-4 inhibitor does not require downward dosing adjustment for impaired renal function. For example, a DPP-4 inhibitor according to this invention (especially one which may be suited for patients with impaired renal function) may be such an oral DPP-4 inhibitor, which and whose active metabolites have preferably a relatively wide (e.g. about >100 fold) therapeutic window and/or, especially, that are primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion. In more detailed example, a DPP-4 inhibitor according to this invention (especially one which may be suited for patients with impaired renal function) may be such an orally administered DPP-4 inhibitor, which has a relatively wide (e.g. >100 fold) therapeutic window and/or which fulfils one or more of the following pharmacokinetic properties (preferably at its therapeutic oral dose levels): The DPP-4 inhibitor is substantially or mainly excreted via the liver (e.g. >80% or even>90% of the administered oral dose), and/or for which renal excretion represents no substantial or only a minor elimination pathway (e.g. <10%, preferably <7%, of the administered oral dose measured, for example, by following elimination of a radiolabelled carbon (14C) substance oral dose);The DPP-4 inhibitor is excreted mainly unchanged as parent drug (e.g. with a mean of >70%, or >80%, or, preferably, 90% of excreted radioactivity in urine and faeces after oral dosing of radiolabelled carbon (14C) substance), and/or which is eliminated to a non-substantial or only to a minor extent via metabolism (e.g. <30%, or <20%, or, preferably, 10%);The (main) metabolite(s) of the DPP-4 inhibitor is/are pharmacologically inactive. Such as e.g. the main metabolite does not bind to the target enzyme DPP-4 and, optionally, it is rapidly eliminated compared to the parent compound (e.g. with a terminal half-life of the metabolite of ≦20 h, or, preferably, ≦about 16 h, such as e.g. 15.9 h). In one embodiment, the (main) metabolite in plasma (which may be pharmacologically inactive) of a DPP-4 inhibitor having a 3-amino-piperidin-1-yl substituent is such a derivative where the amino group of the 3-amino-piperidin-1-yl moiety is replaced by a hydroxyl group to form the 3-hydroxy-piperidin-1-yl moiety (e.g. the 3-(S)-hydroxy-piperidin-1-yl moiety, which is formed by inversion of the configuration of the chiral center). Further properties of a DPP-4 inhibitor according to this invention may be one or more of the following: Rapid attainment of steady state (e.g. reaching steady state plasma levels (>90% of the steady state plasma concentration) between second and fifth day of treatment with therapeutic oral dose levels), little accumulation (e.g. with a mean accumulation ratio RA,AUC≦1.4 with therapeutic oral dose levels), and/or preserving a long-lasting effect on DPP-4 inhibition, preferably when used once-daily (e.g. with almost complete (>90%) DPP-4 inhibition at therapeutic oral dose levels, >80% inhibition over a 24 h interval after once-daily intake of therapeutic oral drug dose), significant decrease in 2 h postprandial blood glucose excursions by ≧80% (already on first day of therapy) at therapeutic dose levels, and cumulative amount of unchanged parent compound excreted in urine on first day being below 1% of the administered dose and increasing to not more than about 3-6% in steady state. Thus, for example, a DPP-4 inhibitor according to this invention may be characterized in that said DPP-4 inhibitor is excreted to a non-substantial or only to a minor extent (e.g. <10%, preferably <7% of administered oral dose) via the kidney (measured, for example, by following elimination of a radiolabelled carbon (14C) substance oral dose). Further, a DPP-4 inhibitor according to this invention may be characterized in that said DPP-4 inhibitor is excreted substantially or mainly via the liver or faeces (measured, for example, by following elimination of a radiolabelled carbon (14C) substance oral dose). Further, a DPP-4 inhibitor according to this invention may be characterized in that said DPP-4 inhibitor is excreted mainly unchanged as parent drug (e.g. with a mean of >70%, or >80%, or, preferably, 90% of excreted radioactivity in urine and faeces after oral dosing of radiolabelled carbon (14C) substance), said DPP-4 inhibitor is eliminated to a non-substantial or only to a minor extent via metabolism, and/or the main metabolite of said DPP-4 inhibitor is pharmacologically inactive or has a relatively wide therapeutic window. Further, a DPP-4 inhibitor according to this invention may be characterized in that said DPP-4 inhibitor does not significantly impair glomerular and/or tubular function of a type 2 diabetes patient with chronic renal insufficiency (e.g. mild, moderate or severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease), and/or said DPP-4 inhibitor does not require to be dose-adjusted in a type 2 diabetes patient with impaired renal function (e.g. mild, moderate or severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease). Further, a DPP-4 inhibitor according to this invention may be characterized in that said DPP-4 inhibitor provides its minimally effective dose at that dose that results in >50% inhibition of DPP-4 activity at trough (24 h after last dose) in >80% of patients, and/or said DPP-4 inhibitor provides its fully therapeutic dose at that dose that results in >80% inhibition of DPP-4 activity at trough (24 h after last dose) in >80% of patients.

A tablet of a DPP-4 inhibitor according to embodiment A of the invention may be film coated, preferably the film coat comprises hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), polyethylene glycol (PEG), talc, titanium dioxide and iron oxide (e.g. red and/or yellow). For details on dosage forms, formulations and administration of DPP-4 inhibitors of this invention and/or GLP-1 receptor agonists of this invention, reference is made to scientific literature and/or published patent documents, particularly to those cited herein. In a preferred embodiment the element DPP-4 inhibitor of the combination according to the invention is preferably administered orally. In another preferred embodiment the component GLP-1 receptor agonist of the combination is preferably administered by injection. Injectable formulations of the GLP-1 receptor agonists of this invention may be prepared according to known formulation techniques, e.g. using suitable liquid carriers, which usually comprise sterile water, and, optionally, further additives e.g. for aiding solubility or for preservation or the like, to obtain injectable solutions or suspensions. The pharmaceutical compositions (or formulations) may be packaged in a variety of ways. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container that contains the pharmaceutical composition in an appropriate form. Tablets are typically packed in an appropriate primary package for easy handling, distribution and storage and for assurance of proper stability of the composition at prolonged contact with the environment during storage. Primary containers for tablets may be bottles or blister packs. A suitable bottle, e.g. for a pharmaceutical composition or combination comprising a DPP-4 inhibitor according to embodiment A of the invention, may be made from glass or polymer (preferably polypropylene (PP) or high density polyethylene (HD-PE)) and sealed with a screw cap. The screw cap may be provided with a child resistant safety closure (e.g. press-and-twist closure) for preventing or hampering access to the contents by children. If required (e.g. in regions with high humidity), by the additional use of a desiccant (such as e.g. bentonite clay, molecular sieves, or, preferably, silica gel) the shelf life of the packaged composition can be prolonged. A suitable blister pack, e.g. for a pharmaceutical composition or combination comprising a DPP-4 inhibitor according to embodiment A of the invention, comprises or is formed of a top foil (which is breachable by the tablets) and a bottom part (which contains pockets for the tablets). The top foil may contain a metalic foil, particularly an aluminium or aluminium alloy foil (e.g. having a thickness of 20 μm to 45 μm, preferably 20 μm to 25 μm) that is coated with a heat-sealing polymer layer on its inner side (sealing side). The bottom part may contain a multi-layer polymer foil (such as e.g. poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) coated with poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC); or a PVC foil laminated with poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PCTFE)) or a multi-layer polymer-metal-polymer foil (such as e.g. a cold-formable laminated PVC/aluminium/polyamide composition). To ensure a long storage period especially under hot and wet climate conditions an additional overwrap or pouch made of a multi-layer polymer-metal-polymer foil (e.g. a laminated polyethylen/aluminium/polyester composition) may be used for the blister packs. Supplementary desiccant (such as e.g. bentonite clay, molecular sieves, or, preferably, silica gel) in this pouch package may prolong the shelf life even more under such harsh conditions. The article may further comprise a label or package insert, which refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that may contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. In one embodiment, the label or package inserts indicates that the composition can be used for any of the purposes described herein. With respect to the first embodiment (embodiment A), the dosage typically required of the DPP-4 inhibitors mentioned herein in embodiment A when administered intravenously is 0.1 mg to 10 mg, preferably 0.25 mg to 5 mg, and when administered orally is 0.5 mg to 100 mg, preferably 2.5 mg to 50 mg or 0.5 mg to 10 mg, more preferably 2.5 mg to 10 mg or 1 mg to 5 mg, in each case 1 to 4 times a day. Thus, e.g. the dosage of 1-[(4-methyl-quinazolin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-8-(3-(R)-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-xanthine when administered orally is 0.5 mg to 10 mg per patient per day, preferably 2.5 mg to 10 mg or 1 mg to 5 mg per patient per day. A dosage form prepared with a pharmaceutical composition comprising a DPP-4 inhibitor mentioned herein in embodiment A contain the active ingredient in a dosage range of 0.1-100 mg. Thus, e.g. particular dosage strengths of 1-[(4-methyl-quinazolin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-8-(3-(R)-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-xanthine are 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg. With respect to the second embodiment (embodiment B), the doses of DPP-4 inhibitors mentioned herein in embodiment B to be administered to mammals, for example human beings, of, for example, approximately 70 kg body weight, may be generally from about 0.5 mg to about 350 mg, for example from about 10 mg to about 250 mg, preferably 20-200 mg, more preferably 20-100 mg, of the active moiety per person per day, or from about 0.5 mg to about 20 mg, preferably 2.5-10 mg, per person per day, divided preferably into 1 to 4 single doses which may, for example, be of the same size. Single dosage strengths comprise, for example, 10, 25, 40, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 mg of the DPP-4 inhibitor active moiety. A dosage strength of the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin is usually between 25 and 200 mg of the active moiety. A recommended dose of sitagliptin is 100 mg calculated for the active moiety (free base anhydrate) once daily. Unit dosage strengths of sitagliptin free base anhydrate (active moiety) are 25, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 mg. Particular unit dosage strengths of sitagliptin (e.g. per tablet) are 25, 50 and 100 mg. An equivalent amount of sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate to the sitagliptin free base anhydrate is used in the pharmaceutical compositions, namely, 32.13, 64.25, 96.38, 128.5, 192.75, and 257 mg, respectively. Adjusted dosages of 25 and 50 mg sitagliptin are used for patients with renal failure. Typical dosage strengths of the dual combination of sitagliptin/metformin are 50/500 mg and 50/1000 mg. A dosage range of the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin is usually between 10 and 150 mg daily, in particular between 25 and 150 mg, 25 and 100 mg or 25 and 50 mg or 50 and 100 mg daily. Particular examples of daily oral dosage are 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 60, 80, 100 or 150 mg. In a more particular aspect, the daily administration of vildagliptin may be between 25 and 150 mg or between 50 and 100 mg. In another more particular aspect, the daily administration of vildagliptin may be 50 or 100 mg. The application of the active ingredient may occur up to three times a day, preferably one or two times a day. Particular dosage strengths are 50 mg or 100 mg vildagliptin. Typical dosage strengths of the dual combination of vildagliptin/metformin are 50/850 mg and 50/1000 mg. Alogliptin may be administered to a patient at a daily dose of between 5 mg/day and 250 mg/day, optionally between 10 mg and 200 mg, optionally between 10 mg and 150 mg, and optionally between 10 mg and 100 mg of alogliptin (in each instance based on the molecular weight of the free base form of alogliptin). Thus, specific dosage amounts that may be used include, but are not limited to 10 mg, 12.5 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg of alogliptin per day. Alogliptin may be administered in its free base form or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Saxagliptin may be administered to a patient at a daily dose of between 2.5 mg/day and 100 mg/day, optionally between 2.5 mg and 50 mg. Specific dosage amounts that may be used include, but are not limited to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg of saxagliptin per day. Typical dosage strengths of the dual combination of saxagliptin/metformin are 2.5/500 mg and 2.5/1000 mg. A special embodiment of the DPP-4 inhibitors of this invention refers to those orally administered DPP-4 inhibitors which are therapeutically efficacious at low dose levels, e.g. at oral dose levels<100 mg or <70 mg per patient per day, preferably <50 mg, more preferably <30 mg or <20 mg, even more preferably from 1 mg to 10 mg, particularly from 1 mg to 5 mg (more particularly 5 mg), per patient per day (if required, divided into 1 to 4 single doses, particularly 1 or 2 single doses, which may be of the same size, preferentially, administered orally once- or twice daily (more preferentially once-daily), advantageously, administered at any time of day, with or without food. Thus, for example, the daily oral amount 5 mg BI 1356 can be given in an once daily dosing regimen (i.e. 5 mg BI 1356 once daily) or in a twice daily dosing regimen (i.e. 2.5 mg BI 1356 twice daily), at any time of day, with or without food. The GLP-1 receptor agonist is typically administered by subcutaneous injection, e.g. ranging from thrice daily, twice daily, once daily to once weekly injection. Suitable doses and dosage forms of the GLP-1 receptor agonist may be determined by a person skilled in the art. For example, exenatide is administered twice daily by subcutaneous injection (Byetta, 5-30 μg, particularly 5-20μg, preferably 5-10 μg, specific dosage strengths are 5 or 10 μg) before a main meal. Exenatide LAR is administered once weekly by subcutaneous injection (0.1-3 mg, particularly 0.5 mg to 2.0 mg, specific dosage strengths are 0.8 mg or 2.0 mg). Liraglutide is administered once daily by subcutaneous injection (Victoza, 0.5-3 mg, particularly 0.5 mg to 2 mg, specific dosage strengths are 0.6 mg, 0.9 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg). Taspoglutide is administered once weekly by subcutaneous injection (1-30 mg, specific dosage strengths are 1 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg). Semaglutide is administered once weekly by subcutaneous injection (0.1-1.6 mg). Albiglutide is administered once weekly by subcutaneous injection (4-30 mg, specific dosage strengths are 4 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg). Lixisenatide is administered once daily by subcutaneous injection (10-20 μg, specific dosage strengths are 10 μg, 15 μg or 20 μg). Dulaglutide is administered once weekly by subcutaneous injection (0.25-3 mg, specific dosage strengths are 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg or 3.0 mg). Besides delivery by injection, other routes of administration of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be contemplated, for example, GLP-1 receptor agonists for use in combination therapy within the meaning of this invention also include, without being limited, such ones which are suited and/or formulated for oral delivery, continuous (subcutaneous) delivery, pulmonary (e.g. via inhalation) or nasal delivery, or transdermal delivery (e.g. via patch), with subcutaneous injection being preferred. The dosage of the active ingredients in the combinations and compositions in accordance with the present invention may be varied, although the amount of the active ingredients shall be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. Hence, the selected dosage and the selected dosage form shall depend on the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration and the duration of the treatment. Suitable dosage ranges for the combination are from the maximal tolerated dose for the single agent to lower doses, e.g. to one tenth of the maximal tolerated dose. A particularly preferred DPP-4 inhibitor to be emphasized within the meaning of this invention is 1-[(4-methyl-quinazolin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-8-(3-(R)-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-xanthine (also known as BI 1356 or linagliptin). BI 1356 exhibits high potency, 24 h duration of action, and a wide therapeutic window. In patients with type 2 diabetes receiving multiple oral doses of 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg of BI 1356 once daily for 12 days, BI 1356 shows favourable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile (see e.g. Table i below) with rapid attainment of steady state (e.g. reaching steady state plasma levels (>90% of the pre-dose plasma concentration on Day 13) between second and fifth day of treatment in all dose groups), little accumulation (e.g. with a mean accumulation ratio RA,AUC≦1.4 with doses above 1 mg) and preserving a long-lasting effect on DPP-4 inhibition (e.g. with almost complete (>90%) DPP-4 inhibition at the 5 mg and 10 mg dose levels, i.e. 92.3 and 97.3% inhibition at steady state, respectively, and >80% inhibition over a 24 h interval after drug intake), as well as significant decrease in 2 h postprandial blood glucose excursions by 80% (already on Day 1) in doses 2.5 mg, and with the cumulative amount of unchanged parent compound excreted in urine on Day 1 being below 1% of the administered dose and increasing to not more than about 3-6% on Day 12 (renal clearance CLR,ss is from about 14 to about 70 mL/min for the administered oral doses, e.g. for the 5 mg dose renal clearance is about 70 ml/min). In people with type 2 diabetes BI 1356 shows a placebo-like safety and tolerability. With low doses of about 5 mg, BI 1356 acts as a true once-daily oral drug with a full 24 h duration of DPP-4 inhibition. At therapeutic oral dose levels, BI 1356 is mainly excreted via the liver and only to a minor extent (about <7% of the administered oral dose) via the kidney. BI 1356 is primarily excreted unchanged via the bile. The fraction of BI 1356 eliminated via the kidneys increases only very slightly over time and with increasing dose, so that there will likely be no need to modify the dose of BI 1356 based on the patients' renal function. The non-renal elimination of BI 1356 in combination with its low accumulation potential and broad safety margin may be of significant benefit in a patient population that has a high prevalence of renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy.

Thus, depending on the functional disorders diagnosed, improved treatment outcomes may be obtained if a DPP-4 inhibitor is combined with active substances customary for the respective disorders, such as e.g. one or more active substances selected from among the other antidiabetic substances, especially active substances that lower the blood sugar level or the lipid level in the blood, raise the HDL level in the blood, lower blood pressure or are indicated in the treatment of atherosclerosis or obesity. The DPP-4 inhibitors mentioned above—besides their use in mono-therapy—may also be used in conjunction with other active substances, by means of which improved treatment results can be obtained. Such a combined treatment may be given as a free combination of the substances or in the form of a fixed combination, for example in a tablet or capsule.

The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein. Various modifications of the invention in addition to those described herein may become apparent to those skilled in the art from the present disclosure. Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. All patent applications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Further embodiments, features and advantages of the present invention may become apparent from the following examples. The following examples serve to illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention without restricting it. EXAMPLES The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of repeated administration of a GLP-1 receptor agonist, such as e.g. exenatide (30 μg/kg/day sc) by subcutaneous minipump for 10 or 28 days and exenatide (30 μg/kg/day sc) for 10 days followed by vehicle or BI 1356 (3 mg/kg po) given orally on body weight in dietary-induced obese (DIO) female Wistar rats (ie in an animal model of obesity). BI 1356 is a novel compound with potential for the treatment of obesity/diabetes. All experimental procedures concerning the use of laboratory animals are carried out under a Home Office Certificate of Designation. Methodology: Obesity is induced-in female Wistar rats for 20 weeks by giving the animals free access to powdered high fat diet (VRF1 plus 20% lard), ground chocolate, ground peanuts and tap water at all times. Two weeks before the start of the baseline readings, animals are housed singly in polypropylene cages with wire grid floors to enable the food intake of each rat to be recorded. Following a 5-day baseline period, osmotic minipumps (2ML2) delivering either vehicle or exenatide are implanted subcutaneously (sc) under anaesthetic. The surgery is performed over two days and therefore the study was divided into two arms (staggered by one day) and the data pooled. On day 11, the osmotic minipumps are removed from all animals and replaced with a new pump (2ML4) containing vehicle or exenatide for 10 days. In addition animals are treated orally with either vehicle (0.5% Natrosol) or BI 1356 and body weight is recorded daily as shown in FIG. 1. When the osmotic mini-pumps start to emerge through the wound clips, animals are re-clipped on one occasion per animal only. Rats are removed from the feeding laboratory for approximately 30 min and the wound resealed under brief (˜10 min) anaesthesia. If the wound re-opened the rat is terminated. Results: Exenatide leads to significant weight loss during the first 11 days. When the animals receive vehicle+vehicle from day 11 on, they gain weight again. However, the animals treated further with the DPP 4 inhibitor BI 1356 stabilize their body weight at the new weight level and are significantly lighter than the vehicle-treated control animals (see FIG. 1). Specific surgical procedures: Animals are anaesthetised using gaseous anaesthesia (isoflurane). Specifically, anaesthesia is induced with isoflurane (5%), O2 (2 l/min), N2O (2 l/min). During this time the implant site is shaved. All surgery will use aseptic technique. During surgery, anaesthesia is maintained with isoflurane at 2%, with O2 (1 l/min) and N2O (1 l/min). The incision is sited at the flank, and a pocket of suitable size is created and the pump inserted. Pumps are filled with vehicle or exenatide shortly before implantation. The wound is sealed by the use of one or more wound clips (VetTech Solutions). Betadine spray and Opsite dressing are applied to the wound. Immediately post surgery, the N2O gas stream is removed and O2 increased to a flow rate of 2 l/min. After approximately 1 min, isoflurane is turned off. Once animals begin to show signs of recovery (e.g. faster breathing rate, tail and/or limb movement) they are placed into the home cage on a heat mat with a heat lamp present. Animals are carefully monitored for up to 2 h following surgery and until they are fully recovered. As soon as the rats recover from the anaesthetic they have free access to food and water. FIG. 1: Body Weight Development FIG. 1: Results are adjusted means±sem; n=5-51 (n values in brackets are the number remaining on day 21.) SEMs are calculated from the residuals of the statistical model. Data analysed by ANCOVA with body weight on Day 1 as covariate.

Exenatide-treated animals show higher incidence for skin alterations, which lead often to euthanization of the respective animals. Linagliptin-treated animals show better survival (see FIG. 2, e.g. after about 22-23 days treatment, vehicle treated animals (A) show about 65% survival, exenatide+vehicle-treated animals (B) show about 67% survival, exenatide+BI 1356-treated animals (E) show about 75% survival, and exenatide-treated animals (F) show about 45% survival).

Means are adjusted for differences between the body weights of the different treatment groups at baseline (Day 1). SEMs are calculated from the residuals of the statistical model. On day 11, the mini-pump was removed and replaced with a second mini-pump. Animals treated with exenatide for 10 days were switched to vehicle treatment for the rest of the study. The change in body weight of animals treated with the DPP-4 inhibitor, linagliptin (3 mg/kg po), on exenatide withdrawal are illustrated on the figure (first bar from right: Exenatide; second bar from right: Exenatide followed by Linagliptin; third bar from right: Exenatide followed by Vehicle).

Data are adjusted for differences between treatment groups in body weight at baseline (Day 1). SEMs are calculated from the residuals of the statistical model. Comparisons against the control group were by the multiple t test: *p < 0.05. Comparisons against the vehicle-treated exenatide withdrawal group by multiple t test: $$ p < 0.01. The effect of linagliptin (BI 1356, 3mg/kg po, once daily for 28 days) either alone or in combination with a low dose of exenatide (3μg/kg/day sc) on body weight, carcass composition and relevant plasma markers of obese female Wistar rats fed a high-fat cafeteria diet (DIO) rats for approximately 20 weeks is assessed. Linagliptin has no effect on body weight, daily food intake, plasma glucose, insulin or carcass fat in DIO rats compared to vehicle-treated controls and does not augment the effect of a low dose of exenatide (delivered via a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump), when dosed in combination. In a follow on study (21 days duration), a high dose of exenatide (30μg/kg/day sc) is shown to reduce body weight (6%; p<0.001) and body fat (16% p<0.05) in DIO rats compared to vehicle-treated controls. Carcass protein (p=0.8) and water (p=0.7) are not affected. In DIO rats where the osmotic minipump delivering exenatide is removed (Day 10) and replaced by an osmotic minipump delivering saline, weight regain is observed such that the body weight of these animals is not significantly different to controls (p=0.239) after 21 days. In contrast, linagliptin (3mg/kg po) reduces weight regain after withdrawal of exenatide such that a significant difference from controls is evident (p<0.05). This weight regain is characterized principally by fat deposition and linagliptin-treated animals put on 10.6% less fat than vehicle-treated counterparts during exenatide withdrawal (p=0.07). In this context, please see also FIG. 3, FIG. 4 and Table (a). These data demonstrate that linagliptin has no weight reducing effect per se in untreated DIO rats or in DIO rats treated with exenatide but in DIO rats where weight loss is induced by a high dose of a GLP-1 receptor agonist or exenatide and then withdrawn, linagliptin reduces or delays subsequent weight regain. Linagliptin can therefore be used in controlling weight rebound during intermittent courses of treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist or exenatide. Diabetic patients may switch from one treatment to another in an effort to avoid unpleasant side effects like nausea that are frequently reported with a GLP-1 receptor agonist or exenatide treatment. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that linagliptin (BI 1356) does not significantly alter body weight, food intake or carcass composition in an established and validated animal model of obesity, i.e. drug-naïve female Wistar rats allowed continuous exposure to a simplified three-component cafeteria diet in order to develop marked obesity, insulin resistance (e.g. hyperinsulinaemia) and/or impaired glucose tolerance. Although exhibiting dietary-induced obesity, the rats used in the present studies do not exhibit a diabetic phenotype and, accordingly, their plasma glucose and HbA1c levels are within a normal range. Accordingly, the present data shows that treatment with linagliptin is a useful strategy for the weight-neutral treatment of diabetes since, in contrast to other drug classes (e.g. thiazolidinediones, sulphonylureas, insulin etc,) linagliptin is unlikely to promote weight gain, a major causative factor in the development of diabetes. Further, the present data are the first to demonstrate that dietary-induced obese rats treated with exenatide lose weight compared to vehicle controls but put this weight back on once withdrawn from the drug. Importantly, this body weight gain does not increase beyond the level of vehicle-treated controls and there is evidence that this weight gain, especially the increase in fat, may be reduced by treatment with linagliptin. Thus, the present invention provides a treatment regimen comprising inducing initial weight loss, e.g. via GLP-1 receptor agonism, and subsequently being replaced by or switching to a DPP-4 inhibitor (preferably linagliptin) treatment, which is favourable for reducing, preventing or delaying subsequent weight regain after weight loss, particularly the concomitant increase in body fat. It is further shown that also the direct combination of linagliptin and low dose of a GLP-1 receptor agonist (exenatide) has a positive effect on body fat which is greater than for the respective single agents (see Table (b)).

Multiple comparisons vs. vehicle are by Williams' test for groups treated solely with exenatide, and the multiple t test for all other groups: aP = 0.050, bP < 0.05, cP < 0.001. dP < 0.05 from the exenatide (3 μg/kg/day) group. GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1. These data show that adding linagliptin to a GLP-1 receptor agonist (e.g. exenatide) provides a dose-sparing effect on the use of the GLP-1 receptor agonist. In a further study the efficacy of chronic treatment with linagliptin on body weight, total body fat, intra-myocellular fat, and hepatic fat in a non-diabetic model of diet induced obesity (DIO) in comparison to the appetite suppressant subutramine is investigated: Rats are fed a high-fat diet for 3 months and received either vehicle, linagliptin (10 mg/kg), or sibutramine (5 mg/kg) for 6 additional weeks, while continuing the high-fat diet. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) analysis of total body fat, muscle fat, and liver fat is performed before treatment and at the end of the study. Sibutramine causes a significant reduction of body weight (−12%) versus control, whereas linagliptin has no significant effect (−3%). Total body fat is also significantly reduced by sibutramine (−12%), whereas linagliptin-treated animals show no significant reduction (−5%). However, linagliptin and sibutramine result both in a potent reduction of intramyocellular fat (−24% and −34%, respectively). In addition, treatment with linagliptin results in a profound decrease of hepatic fat (−39%), whereas the effect of sibutramine (−30%) does not reach significance (see Table (c)). Thus, linagliptin is weight neutral but improves intra-myocellular and hepatic lipid accumulation.

The effects of sibutramine on muscular and hepatic fat are attributed mainly to the known weight reduction induced by this compound. 1.
