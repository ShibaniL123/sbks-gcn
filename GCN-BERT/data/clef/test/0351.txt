INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE The sequence listing submitted with this application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to glutaminyl cyclase (QC, EC 2.3.2.5) that catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal glutamine residues into pyroglutamic acid (5-oxo-prolyl, pGlu*) under liberation of ammonia and the intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal glutamate residues into pyroglutamic acid under liberation of water. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Glutaminyl cyclase (QC, EC 2.3.2.5) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal glutamine residues into pyroglutamic acid (pGlu*) liberating ammonia. A QC was first isolated by Messer from the latex of the tropical plant Carica papaya in 1963 (Messer, M. 1963 Nature 4874, 1299). 24 years later, a corresponding enzymatic activity was discovered in animal pituitary (Busby, W. H. J. et al. 1987 J Biol Chem 262, 8532-8536; Fischer, W. H. and Spiess, J. 1987 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 84, 3628-3632). For the mammalian QC, the conversion of Gln into pGlu by QC could be shown for the precursors of TRH and GnRH (Busby, W. H. J. et al. 1987 J Biol Chem 262, 8532-8536; Fischer, W. H. and Spiess, J. 1987 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 84, 3628-3632). In addition, initial localization experiments of QC revealed a co-localization with its putative products of catalysis in bovine pituitary, further improving the suggested function in peptide hormone synthesis (Bockers, T. M. et al. 1995 J Neuroendocrinol 7, 445-453). In contrast, the physiological function of the plant QC is less clear. In the case of the enzyme from C. papaya, a role in the plant defense against pathogenic microorganisms was suggested (El Moussaoui, A. et al. 2001 Cell Mol Life Sci 58, 556-570). Putative QCs from other plants were identified by sequence comparisons recently (Dahl, S. W. et al. 2000 Protein Expr Purif 20, 27-36). The physiological function of these enzymes, however, is still ambiguous. The QCs known from plants and animals show a strict specificity for L-Glutamine in the N-terminal position of the substrates and their kinetic behavior was found to obey the Michaelis-Menten equation (Pohl, T. et al. 1991 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88, 10059-10063; Consalvo, A. P. et al. 1988 Anal Biochem 175, 131-138; Gololobov, M. Y. et al. 1996 Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler 377, 395-398). A comparison of the primary structures of the QCs from C. papaya and that of the highly conserved QC from mammals, however, did not reveal any sequence homology (Dahl, S. W. et al. 2000 Protein Expr Purif 20, 27-36). Whereas the plant QCs appear to belong to a new enzyme family (Dahl, S. W. et al. 2000 Protein Expr Purif 20, 27-36), the mammalian QCs were found to have a pronounced sequence homology to bacterial aminopeptidases (Bateman, R. C. et al. 2001 Biochemistry 40, 11246-11250), leading to the conclusion that the QCs from plants and animals have different evolutionary origins. Recently, it was shown that recombinant human QC as well as QC-activity from brain extracts catalyze both, the N-terminal glutaminyl as well as glutamate cyclization. Most striking is the finding, that cyclase-catalyzed Glu1-conversion is favored around pH 6.0 while Gln1-conversion to pGlu-derivatives occurs with a pH-optimum of around 8.0. Since the formation of pGlu-Aβ-related peptides can be suppressed by inhibition of recombinant human QC and QC-activity from pig pituitary extracts, the enzyme QC is a target in drug development for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. First inhibitors of QC are described in WO 2004/098625, WO 2004/098591, WO 2005/039548 and WO 2005/075436. EP 02 011 349.4 discloses polynucleotides encoding insect glutaminyl cyclase, as well as polypeptides encoded thereby and their use in methods of screening for agents that reduce glutaminyl cyclase activity. Such agents are useful as pesticides. DEFINITIONS The terms “ki” or “Kl” and “KD” are binding constants, which describe the binding of an inhibitor to and the subsequent release from an enzyme. Another measure is the “IC50” value, which reflects the inhibitor concentration, which at a given substrate concentration results in 50% enzyme activity. The term “DP IV-inhibitor” or “dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor” is generally known to a person skilled in the art and means enzyme inhibitors, which inhibit the catalytic activity of DP IV or DP IV-like enzymes. “DP IV-activity” is defined as the catalytic activity of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) and DP IV-like enzymes. These enzymes are post-proline (to a lesser extent post-alanine, post-serine or post-glycine) cleaving serine proteases found in various tissues of the body of a mammal including kidney, liver, and intestine, where they remove dipeptides from the N-terminus of biologically active peptides with a high specificity when proline or alanine form the residues that are adjacent to the N-terminal amino acid in their sequence. The term “PEP-inhibitor” or “prolyl endopeptidase inhibitor” is generally known to a person skilled in the art and means enzyme inhibitors, which inhibit the catalytic activity of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP, prolyl oligopeptidase, POP). “PEP-activity” is defined as the catalytic activity of an endoprotease that is capable to hydrolyze post proline bonds in peptides or proteins were the proline is in amino acid position 3 or higher counted from the N-terminus of a peptide or protein substrate. The term “QC” as used herein comprises glutaminyl cyclase (QC) and QC-like enzymes. QC and QC-like enzymes have identical or similar enzymatic activity, further defined as QC activity. In this regard, QC-like enzymes can fundamentally differ in their molecular structure from QC. Examples of QC-like enzymes are the glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like proteins (QPCTLs) from human (GenBank NM—017659), mouse (GenBank BC058181), Macaca fascicularis (GenBank AB168255), Macaca mulatta (GenBank XM—001110995), Canis familiaris (GenBank XM—541552), Rattus norvegicus (GenBank XM—001066591), Mus musculus (GenBank BC058181) and Bos taurus (GenBank BT026254). The term “QC activity” as used herein is defined as intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal glutamine residues into pyroglutamic acid (pGlu*) or of N-terminal L-homoglutamine or L-β-homoglutamine to a cyclic pyro-homoglutamine derivative under liberation of ammonia. See therefore schemes 1 and 2. The term “EC” as used herein comprises the activity of QC and QC-like enzymes as glutamate cyclase (EC), further defined as EC activity. The term “EC activity” as used herein is defined as intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal glutamate residues into pyroglutamic acid (pGlu*) by QC. See therefore scheme 3. The term “QC-inhibitor” “glutaminyl cyclase inhibitor” is generally known to a person skilled in the art and means enzyme inhibitors, which inhibit the catalytic activity of glutaminyl cyclase (QC) or its glutamyl cyclase (EC) activity. Potency of QC Inhibition In light of the correlation with QC inhibition, in preferred embodiments, the subject method and medical use utilize an agent with an IC50 for QC inhibition of 10 μM or less, more preferably of 1 μM or less, even more preferably of 0.1 μM or less or 0.01 μM or less, or most preferably 0.001 μM or less. Indeed, inhibitors with Ki values in the lower micromolar, preferably the nanomolar and even more preferably the picomolar range are contemplated. Thus, while the active agents are described herein, for convenience, as “QC inhibitors”, it will be understood that such nomenclature is not intending to limit the subject of the invention to a particular mechanism of action. Molecular Weight of QC Inhibitors In general, the QC inhibitors of the subject method or medical use will be small molecules, e.g., with molecular weights of 500 g/mole or less, 400 g/mole or less, preferably of 350 g/mole or less, and even more preferably of 300 g/mole or less and even of 250 g/mole or less. The term “subject” as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment. The term “therapeutically effective amount” as used herein, means that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” embraces both human and veterinary use: For example the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” embraces a veterinarily acceptable compound or a compound acceptable in human medicine and health care.

Tachykinins are active peptides which excite neurons, evoke behavioral responses, are potent vasodilators and secretagogues, and contract (directly or indirectly) many smooth muscles. QYNAD Gln-Tyr-Asn-Ala-Asp Acts on voltage-gated sodium channels. Glutamate is found in positions 3, 11 and 22 of the amyloid β-peptide. Among them the mutation from glutamic acid (E) to glutamine (Q) in position 22 (corresponding to amyloid precursor protein APP 693, Swissprot P05067) has been described as the so called Dutch type cerebroarterial amyloidosis mutation. The β-amyloid peptides with a pyroglutamic acid residue in position 3, 11 and/or 22 have been described to be more cytotoxic and hydrophobic than the amyloid β-peptides 1-40(42/43) (Saido T.C. 2000 Medical Hypotheses 54(3): 427-429). The multiple N-terminal variations, e.g. Abeta(3-40), Abeta(3-42), Abeta(11-40) and Abeta (11-42) can be generated by the β-secretase enzyme β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE) at different sites (Huse J. T. et al. 2002 J. Biol. Chem. 277 (18): 16278-16284), and/or by aminopeptidase or dipeptidylaminopeptidase processing from the full length peptides Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). In all cases, cyclization of the then N-terminal occurring glutamic acid residue is catalyzed by QC. Transepithelial transducing cells, particularly the gastrin (G) cell, co-ordinate gastric acid secretion with the arrival of food in the stomach. Recent work showed that multiple active products are generated from the gastrin precursor, and that there are multiple control points in gastrin biosynthesis. Biosynthetic precursors and intermediates (progastrin and Gly-gastrins) are putative growth factors; their products, the amidated gastrins, regulate epithelial cell proliferation, the differentiation of acid-producing parietal cells and histamine-secreting enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, and the expression of genes associated with histamine synthesis and storage in ECL cells, as well as acutely stimulating acid secretion. Gastrin also stimulates the production of members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, which in turn inhibit parietal cell function but stimulate the growth of surface epithelial cells. Plasma gastrin concentrations are elevated in subjects with Helicobacter pylori, who are known to have increased risk of duodenal ulcer disease and gastric cancer (Dockray, G. J. 1999 J Physiol 15 315-324). The peptide hormone gastrin, released from antral G cells, is known to stimulate the synthesis and release of histamine from ECL cells in the oxyntic mucosa via CCK-2 receptors. The mobilized histamine induces acid secretion by binding to the H(2) receptors located on parietal cells. Recent studies suggest that gastrin, in both its fully amidated and less processed forms (progastrin and glycine-extended gastrin), is also a growth factor for the gastrointestinal tract. It has been established that the major trophic effect of amidated gastrin is for the oxyntic mucosa of stomach, where it causes increased proliferation of gastric stem cells and ECL cells, resulting in increased parietal and ECL cell mass. On the other hand, the major trophic target of the less processed gastrin (e.g. glycine-extended gastrin) appears to be the colonic mucosa (Koh, T. J. and Chen, D. 2000 Regul Pept 9337-44). Neurotensin (NT) is a neuropeptide implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia that specifically modulates neurotransmitter systems previously demonstrated to be misregulated in this disorder. Clinical studies in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NT concentrations have been measured revealed a subset of schizophrenic patients with decreased CSF NT concentrations that are restored by effective antipsychotic drug treatment. Considerable evidence also exists concordant with the involvement of NT systems in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. The behavioral and biochemical effects of centrally administered NT remarkably resemble those of systemically administered antipsychotic drugs, and antipsychotic drugs increase NT neurotransmission. This concatenation of findings led to the hypothesis that NT functions as an endogenous antipsychotic. Moreover, typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs differentially alter NT neurotransmission in nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine terminal regions, and these effects are predictive of side effect liability and efficacy, respectively (Binder, E. B. et al. 2001 Biol Psychiatry 50 856-872). Fertilization promoting peptide (FPP), a tripeptide related to thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH), is found in seminal plasma. Recent evidence obtained in vitro and in vivo showed that FPP plays an important role in regulating sperm fertility. Specifically, FPP initially stimulates nonfertilizing (uncapacitated) spermatozoa to “switch on” and become fertile more quickly, but then arrests capacitation so that spermatozoa do not undergo spontaneous acrosome loss and therefore do not lose fertilizing potential. These responses are mimicked, and indeed augmented, by adenosine, known to regulate the adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cAMP signal transduction pathway. Both FPP and adenosine have been shown to stimulate cAMP production in uncapacitated cells but inhibit it in capacitated cells, with FPP receptors somehow interacting with adenosine receptors and G proteins to achieve regulation of AC. These events affect the tyrosine phosphorylation state of various proteins, some being important in the initial “switching on,” others possibly being involved in the acrosome reaction itself. Calcitonin and angiotensin 11, also found in seminal plasma, have similar effects in vitro on uncapacitated spermatozoa and can augment responses to FPP. These molecules have similar effects in vivo, affecting fertility by stimulating and then maintaining fertilizing potential. Either reductions in the availability of FPP, adenosine, calcitonin, and angiotensin 11 or defects in their receptors contribute to male infertility (Fraser, L. R. and Adeoya-Osiguwa, S. A. 2001 Vitam Horm 63, 1-28). CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL16, CCL18 and fractalkine play an important role in pathophysiological conditions, such as suppression of proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells, neoplasia, inflammatory host responses, cancer, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, vasculitis, humoral and cell-mediated immunity responses, leukocyte adhesion and migration processes at the endothelium, inflammatory bowel disease, restenosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertention, liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, nephrosclerosis, ventricular remodeling, heart failure, arteriopathy after organ transplantations and failure of vein grafts. Several cytotoxic T lymphocyte peptide-based vaccines against hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus and melanoma were recently studied in clinical trials. One interesting melanoma vaccine candidate alone or in combination with other tumor antigens, is the decapeptide ELA. This peptide is a Melan-A/MART-1 antigen immunodominant peptide analog, with an N-terminal glutamic acid. It has been reported that the amino group and gamma-carboxylic group of glutamic acids, as well as the amino group and gamma-carboxamide group of glutamines, condense easily to form pyroglutamic derivatives. To overcome this stability problem, several peptides of pharmaceutical interest have been developed with a pyroglutamic acid instead of N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid, without loss of pharmacological properties. Unfortunately compared with ELA, the pyroglutamic acid derivative (PyrELA) and also the N-terminal acetyl-capped derivative (AcELA) failed to elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. Despite the apparent minor modifications introduced in PyrELA and AcELA, these two derivatives probably have lower affinity than ELA for the specific class I major histocompatibility complex. Consequently, in order to conserve full activity of ELA, the formation of PyrELA must be avoided (Beck A. et al. 2001, J Pept Res 57(6):528-38.). Orexin A is a neuropeptide that plays a significant role in the regulation of food intake and sleep-wakefulness, possibly by coordinating the complex behavioral and physiologic responses of these complementary homeostatic functions. It plays also a role in the homeostatic regulation of energy metabolism, autonomic function, hormonal balance and the regulation of body fluids. Recently, increased levels of the pentapeptide QYNAD were identified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome compared to healthy individuals (Brinkmeier H. et al. 2000, Nature Medicine 6, 808-811). There is a big controversy in the literature about the mechanism of action of the pentapeptide Gln-Tyr-Asn-Ala-Asp (QYNAD), especially its efficacy to interact with and block sodium channels resulting in the promotion of axonal dysfunction, which are involved in inflammatory autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system. But recently, it could be demonstrated that not QYNAD, but its cyclized, pyroglutamated form, pEYNAD, is the active form, which blocks sodium channels resulting in the promotion of axonal dysfunction. Sodium channels are expressed at high density in myelinated axons and play an obligatory role in conducting action potentials along axons within the mammalian brain and spinal cord. Therefore, it is speculated that they are involved in several aspects of the pathophysiology of inflammatory autoimmune diseases, especially multiple sclerosis, the Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinizing polyradiculoneuropathy. Furthermore, QYNAD is a substrate of the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC, EC 2.3.2.5), which is also present in the brain of mammals, especially in human brain. Glutaminyl cyclase catalyzes effectively the formation of pEYNAD from its precursor QYNAD.

Pharmaceutical Compositions To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, at least one compound of formula (I), without the provisos, optionally in combination with at least one of the other aforementioned agents can be used as the active ingredient(s). The active ingredient(s) is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral such as intramuscular. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. Thus, for liquid oral preparations, such as for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like; for solid oral preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules, gelcaps and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques. For parenterals, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, though other ingredients, for example, for purposes such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may be included. Injectable suspensions may also prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful and the like, an amount of the active ingredient(s) necessary to deliver an effective dose as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, from about 0.03 mg to 100 mg/kg (preferred 0.1-30 mg/kg) and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.1-300 mg/kg per day (preferred 1-50 mg/kg per day) of each active ingredient or combination thereof. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirement of the patients, the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or post-periodic dosing may be employed. Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto injector devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of each active ingredient or combinations thereof of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the compositions of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of material can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate. This liquid forms in which the compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin. The pharmaceutical composition may contain between about 0.01 mg and 100 mg, preferably about 5 to 50 mg, of each compound, and may be constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected. Carriers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical excipients, including, but not limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions suitable for oral administration include solid forms, such as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including immediate release, timed release and sustained release formulations), granules, and powders, and liquid forms, such as solutions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions, and suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions. Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders; lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or betalactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. The liquid forms in suitable flavored suspending or dispersing agents such as the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl-cellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired. The compounds or combinations of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines. Compounds or combinations of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamid-ephenol, or polyethyl eneoxidepolyllysine substituted with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polyactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyeric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels. Compounds or combinations of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever treatment of the addressed disorders is required. The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 0.01 to 1.000 mg per mammal per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 500 milligrams of each active ingredient or combinations thereof for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg of body weight per day. Preferably, the range is from about 1 to about 50 mg/kg of body weight per day. The compounds or combinations may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day. Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of administration, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and the advancement of disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the particular patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages. In a further aspect, the invention also provides a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I), without the provisos, optionally in combination with at least one of the other aforementioned agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions are preferably in a unit dosage form in an amount appropriate for the relevant daily dosage.

Excitation/emission wavelengths were 380/460 nm. The assay reactions were initiated by addition of glutaminyl cyclase. QC activity was determined from a standard curve of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin under assay conditions. The kinetic data were evaluated using GraFit software. Spectrophotometric Assay of QC This novel assay was used to determine the kinetic parameters for most of the QC substrates. QC activity was analyzed spectrophotometrically using a continuous method, that was derived by adapting a previous discontinuous assay (Bateman, R. C. J. 1989 J Neurosci Methods 30, 23-28) utilizing glutamate dehydrogenase as auxiliary enzyme. Samples consisted of the respective QC substrate, 0.3 mM NADH, 14 mM α-Ketoglutaric acid and 30 U/ml glutamate dehydrogenase in a final volume of 250 μl. Reactions were started by addition of QC and persued by monitoring of the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm for 8-15 min. The initial velocities were evaluated and the enzymatic activity was determined from a standard curve of ammonia under assay conditions. All samples were measured at 30° C., using either the SPECTRAFluor Plus or the Sunrise (both from TECAN) reader for microplates. Kinetic data was evaluated using GraFit software. Inhibitor Assay For inhibitor testing, the sample composition was the same as described above, except of the putative inhibitory compound added. For a rapid test of QC-inhibition, samples contained 4 mM of the respective inhibitor and a substrate concentration at 1 KM. For detailed investigations of the inhibition and determination of Ki-values, influence of the inhibitor on the auxiliary enzymes was investigated first. In every case, there was no influence on either enzyme detected, thus enabling the reliable determination of the QC inhibition. The inhibitory constant was evaluated by fitting the set of progress curves to the general equation for competitive inhibition using GraFit software. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was carried out using the Hewlett-Packard G2025 LD-TOF System with a linear time of flight analyzer. The instrument was equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser, a potential acceleration source (5 kV) and a 1.0 m flight tube. Detector operation was in the positive-ion mode and signals are recorded and filtered using LeCroy 9350M digital storage oscilloscope linked to a personal computer. Samples (5 μl) were mixed with equal volumes of the matrix solution. For matrix solution DHAP/DAHC was used, prepared by solving 30 mg 2′,6′-dihydroxyacetophenone (Aldrich) and 44 mg diammonium hydrogen citrate (Fluka) in 1 ml acetonitrile/0.1% TFA in water (1/1, v/v). A small volume (≈1 μl) of the matrix-analyte-mixture was transferred to a probe tip and immediately evaporated in a vacuum chamber (Hewlett-Packard G2024A sample prep accessory) to ensure rapid and homogeneous sample crystallization. For long-term testing of Glu1-cyclization, Aβ-derived peptides were incubated in 100 μl 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2 or 0.1 M Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.5 at 30° C. Peptides were applied in 0.5 mM [Aβ(3-11)a] or 0.15 mM [Aβ(3-21)a] concentrations, and 0.2 U QC is added all 24 hours. In case of Aβ(3-21)a, the assays contained 1% DMSO. At different times, samples are removed from the assay tube, peptides extracted using ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, mixed with matrix solution (1:1 v/v) and subsequently the mass spectra recorded. Negative controls either contain no QC or heat deactivated enzyme. For the inhibitor studies the sample composition was the same as described above, with exception of the inhibitory compound added (5 mM or 2 mM of a test compound of the invention). The first QC inhibitors were disclosed in WO 2004/098591 and WO 2005/075436. There are no other potent QC inhibitors known in the art. The same holds true for combinations and compositions for the treatment of neuronal diseases comprising QC inhibitors. Compounds and combinations of the invention may have the advantage that they are, for example, more potent, more selective, have fewer side-effects, have better formulation and stability properties, have better pharmacokinetic properties, be more bioavailable, be able to cross blood brain barrier and are more effective in the brain of mammals, are more compatible or effective in combination with other drugs or be more readily synthesized than other compounds of the prior art.
