Technical field The present invention refers to the field of pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, in particular to a screening tool for anti-inflammatory drug discovery and for the detection of the risk or presence of inflammatory conditions. Said screening tool comprising the sequence of the FPR2/ALX gene promoter. Background of the invention - Prior Art Resolution of inflammation, an active process that prevents damage to the host and reestablishes homeostasis, is governed by specific mediators (Serhan, C.N., S.D. Brain, C.D. Buckley, D.W. Gilroy, C. Haslett, L.A. O'Neill, M. Perretti, A.G. Rossi, and J.L. Wallace. 2007. Resolution of inflammation: state of the art, definitions and terms. FASEB J 21:325-332). Among these, the arachidonic acid (AA)-derived lipoxins (LX), an acronym for lipoxygenase (LO)-interaction-products, were the first autacoids recognized to carry dual antiinflammatory and pro-resolution activities (Maderna, P., and C. Godson. 2009. Lipoxins: resolutionary road. Br J Pharmacol 158:947-959; Serhan, C.N., M. Hamberg, and B. Samuelsson. 1984a. Lipoxins: novel series of biologically active compounds formed from arachidonic acid in human leukocytes. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 81:5335-5339; Serhan, C.N., M. Hamberg, and B. Samuelsson. 1984b. Trihydroxytetraenes: a novel series of compounds formed from arachidonic acid in human leukocytes. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 118:943-949). LXA4 (5,6,15S-trihydroxy-7,9,11,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid) is biosynthesized during cell-cell interactions by transcellular metabolic routes involving 5-LO and 12- or 15-LO (Maderna, P., and C. Godson. 2009. Lipoxins: resolutionary road. Br J Pharmacol 158:947-959; Romano, M. 2010. Lipoxin and aspirin-triggered lipoxins. ScientificWorldJournal 10:1048-1064). Within the vasculature, different pathways lead to the biosynthesis of LX. During platelet-leukocyte interactions, leukotriene (LT)A4 released from leukocytes is converted into LXA4 and B4 by platelet 12-LO (Romano, M., and C.N. Serhan. 1992. Lipoxin generation by permeabilized human platelets. Biochemistry 31:8269-8277; Romano, M., X.S. Chen, Y. Takahashi, S. Yamamoto, C.D. Funk, and C.N. Serhan. 1993. Lipoxin synthase activity of human platelet 12-lipoxygenase. Biochem J 296 ( Pt 1):127-133). In addition, aspirin, a widely used anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drug, promotes the biosynthesis of C15 epimers of LX (5,6,15R-trihydroxy-7,9,11,13-trans-11-cis- eicosatetraenoic acid), also termed "aspirin triggered" LX (ATL) via acetylation of endothelial cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (Claria, J., and C.N. Serhan. 1995. Aspirin triggers previously undescribed bioactive eicosanoids by human endothelial cell-leukocyte interactions. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 92:9475-9479). ATL proved to mediate the anti-inflammatory actions of low-dose aspirin in humans, independently from inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis (Morris, T., M. Stables, A. Hobbs, P. de Souza, P. Colville-Nash, T. Warner, J. Newson, G. Bellingan, and D.W. Gilroy. 2009. Effects of low-dose aspirin on acute inflammatory responses in humans. J Immunol 183:2089-2096). Importantly, statins, through the S-nitrosilation of COX-2, also trigger the generation of 15-epi-LXA4 (Birnbaum, Y., Y. Ye, Y. Lin, S.Y. Freeberg, S.P. Nishi, J.D. Martinez, M.H. Huang, B.F. Uretsky, and J.R. Perez-Polo. 2006. Augmentation of myocardial production of 15-epi-lipoxin-a4 by pioglitazone and atorvastatin in the rat. Circulation 114:929-935; Planaguma, A., M.A. Pfeffer, G. Rubin, R. Croze, M. Uddin, C.N. Serhan, and B.D. Levy. 2010. Lovastatin decreases acute mucosal inflammation via 15-epi-lipoxin A4. Mucosal Immunol 3:270-279). LXA4 and ATL modulate the immune-inflammatory response by inhibiting polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration in inflamed tissues and stimulating phagocytosis of apoptotic PMN and microbes (Maderna, P., and C. Godson. 2009. Lipoxins: resolutionary road. Br J Pharmacol 158:947-959) in vivo, thus promoting resolution. Moreover, they display potent protective actions in the cardiovascular district, by directly stimulating the production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide, upregulating heme oxygenase-1, and reducing oxidative stress in endothelial cells (Maderna, P., and C. Godson. 2009. Lipoxins: resolutionary road. Br J Pharmacol 158:947-959). LXA4 and ATL exert their bioactions by activating a specific G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Initially reported as a structural homologue of the N-formyl peptide receptor and termed formyl peptide receptor like-1 (FPRL1) (Murphy, P.M., T. Ozcelik, R.T. Kenney, H.L. Tiffany, D. McDermott, and U. Francke. 1992. A structural homologue of the N-formyl peptide receptor. Characterization and chromosome mapping of a peptide chemoattractant receptor family. J Biol Chem 267:7637-7643; Perez, H.D., R. Holmes, E. Kelly, J. McClary, and W.H. Andrews. 1992. Cloning of a cDNA encoding a receptor related to the formyl peptide receptor of human neutrophils. Gene 118:303-304; Ye, R.D., S.L. Cavanagh, O. Quehenberger, E.R. Prossnitz, and C.G. Cochrane. 1992. Isolation of a cDNA that encodes a novel granulocyte N-formyl peptide receptor. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 184:582-589) it was later identified as the LXA4 receptor in human leukocytes (Fiore, S., J.F. Maddox, H.D. Perez, and C.N. Serhan. 1994. Identification of a human cDNA encoding a functional high affinity lipoxin A4 receptor. J Exp Med 180:253-260). The most recent nomenclature has renamed this receptor FPR2/ALX in light of its high affinity for LXA4 (Ye, R.D., F. Boulay, J.M. Wang, C. Dahlgren, C. Gerard, M. Parmentier, C.N. Serhan, and P.M. Murphy. 2009. International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. LXXIII. Nomenclature for the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family. Pharmacol Rev 61:119-161).The FPR2/ALX gene (Bao, L., N.P. Gerard, R.L. Jr Eddy, T.B. Shows, and C. Gerard. 1992. Mapping of genes for the human C5a receptor (C5AR), human FMLP receptor (FPR), and two FMLP receptor homologue orphan receptors (FPRH1, FPRH2) to chromosome 19. Genomics 13:437-440) is located on chromosome 19. It spans 9.6 kb and encompasses two exons and two introns. Alternative splicing produces four different transcripts, which encode the same seven transmembrane domain protein of 351 aminoacids. Human FPR2/ALX is highly expressed in myeloid cells and at a lower extent in lymphocytes, endothelial and epithelial cells (Romano, M., I. Recchia, and A. Recchiuti. 2007. Lipoxin receptors. ScientificWorldJournal 7:1393-1412). Orthologues of the human FPR2/ALX have been identified in the mouse (Takano, T., S. Fiore, J.F. Maddox, H.R. Brady, N.A. Petasis, and C.N. Serhan. 1997. Aspirin-triggered 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and LXA4 stable analogues are potent inhibitors of acute inflammation: evidence for anti-inflammatory receptors. J Exp Med 185:1693-1704) and rat (Chiang, N., T. Takano, M. Arita, S. Watanabe, and C.N. Serhan. 2003. A novel rat lipoxin A4 receptor that is conserved in structure and function. Br J Pharmacol 139:89-98). In addition to LXA4, FPR2/ALX is activated by the glucocorticoid-induced protein annexin-1 and its N-terminal peptides (Perretti, M., N. Chiang, M. La, I.M. Fierro, S. Marullo, S.J. Getting, E. Solito, and C.N. Serhan. 2002. Endogenous lipid- and peptide-derived anti-inflammatory pathways generated with glucocorticoid and aspirin treatment activate the lipoxin A4 receptor. Nat Med 8:1296-1302), representing the first identified GPCR able to mediate anti-inflammatory and proresolving actions of both lipid and peptide endogenous mediators. Recently, activation of FPR2/ALX by the omega 3-derived pro-resolution mediator, Resolvin D1 has been reported (Krishnamoorthy, S., A. Recchiuti, N. Chiang, S. Yacoubian, C.H. Lee, R. Yang, N.A. Petasis, and C.N. Serhan. 2010. Resolvin D1 binds human phagocytes with evidence for proresolving receptors. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 107:1660-1665) further supporting the relevance of this receptor in inflammation resolution. On the other hand, FPR2/ALX can trigger pro-inflammatory signaling when activated by some microbial and mitochondrial peptides (Romano, M., I. Recchia, and A. Recchiuti. 2007. Lipoxin receptors. ScientificWorldJournal 7:1393-1412) raising the question of its pathophysiological significance in vivo. This question has been addressed by gene manipulation studies. Overexpression of human FPR2/ALX in myeloid cells of transgenic mice reduced neutrophil infiltration in a model of zymosan-induced peritonitis in vivo in the absence of exogenously added agonists (Devchand, P.R., M. Arita, S. Hong, G. Bannenberg, R.L. Moussignac, K. Gronert, and C.N. Serhan. 2003. Human ALX receptor regulates neutrophil recruitment in transgenic mice: roles in inflammation and host defense. FASEB J 17:652-659). Moreover, genetic deletion of the murine orthologue of human FPR2/ALX resulted in a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype, with lack of resolution and no response to annexin 1 and LXA4 (Dufton, N., R. Hannon, V. Brancaleone, J. Dalli, H.B. Patel, M. Gray, F. D'Acquisto, J.C. Buckingham, M. Perretti, and R.J. Flower. 2010. Anti-inflammatory role of the murine formylpeptide receptor 2: ligand-specific effects on leukocyte responses and experimental inflammation. J Immunol 184:2611-2619). Along these lines, 15-epi-LXA4 biosynthesis and FPR2/ALX expression determine the magnitude and duration of the inflammatory reaction in humans (Morris, T., M. Stables, P. Colville-Nash, J. Newson, G. Bellingan, P.M. de Souza, and D.W. Gilroy. 2010. Dichotomy in duration and severity of acute inflammatory responses in humans arising from differentially expressed proresolution pathways. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107:8842-8847). Furthermore, decreased LXA4 biosynthesis and FPR2/ALX expression have been observed in asthmatic patients (Levy, B.D., C. Bonnans, E.S. Silverman, L.J. Palmer, G. Marigowda, and E. Israel. 2005. Diminished lipoxin biosynthesis in severe asthma. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 172:824-830; Planaguma, A., S. Kazani, G. Marigowda, O. Haworth, T.J. Mariani, E. Israel, E.R. Bleecker, D. Curran-Everett, S.C. Erzurum, W.J. Calhoun, M. Castro, K.F. Chung, B. Gaston, N.N. Jarjour, W.W. Busse, S.E. Wenzel, and B.D. Levy. 2008. Airway lipoxin A4 generation and lipoxin A4 receptor expression are decreased in severe asthma. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 178:574-582).These observations support the anti-inflammatory, pro-resolution function of the LXA4-FPR2/ALX axis, whose impairment may represent an underlying pathogenetic mechanism of inflammatory chronic diseases.

Technical problem Lipoxin (LX) A4, a main endogenous stop-signal of inflammation, activates the G protein-coupled receptor FPR2/ALX, which is highly expressed in myeloid cells and triggers anti-inflammatory signaling, in vivo. Thus, the mechanisms of FPR2/ALX expression may have potential pathophysiological and therapeutic relevance. Despite of accumulating evidence that FPR2/ALX expression level may have pathophysiological relevance, mechanisms that regulate this expression are poorly understood. Enhanced expression by glucocorticoids and selected cytokines has been documented (Sawmynaden, P., and M. Perretti. 2006. Glucocorticoid upregulation of the annexin-A1 receptor in leukocytes. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 349:1351-1355; Gronert, K., A. Gewirtz, J.L. Madara, and C.N. Serhan. 1998. Identification of a human enterocyte lipoxin A4 receptor that is regulated by interleukin (IL)-13 and interferon gamma and inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced IL-8 release. J Exp Med 187:1285-1294) but no information is currently available on the FPR2/ALX transcription machinery. The search of the FPR2/ALX promoter has been unfruitful for almost two decades despite of the substantial effort of a number of investigators worldwide. Initial attempts by the inventors were based on the FPR2/ALX gene structure reported by Murphy (SEQ. ID. NO. 1) (Murphy, P.M., T. Ozcelik, R.T. Kenney, H.L. Tiffany, D. McDermott, and U. Francke. 1992. A structural homologue of the N-formyl peptide receptor. Characterization and chromosome mapping of a peptide chemoattractant receptor family. J Biol Chem 267:7637-7643). Murphy et al. discloses a mRNA sequence of FPR2/ALX deriving from alternative splicing, comprising an open reading frame (ORF) of 1056 bp and a 5'-end with an intronic sequence followed by an exon. The sequence found by Murphy, however, does not comprise the regulatory sequences. For this reason the FPR2/ALX promoter could not be identified on the base of the Murphy's sequence. On the contrary, the proponents of the present invention based their investigation on a different mRNA species, deriving from alternative splicing and corresponding to the virtual genome asset labeled as c in Figure 1A. This species comprises the ORF described by Murphy, but displays a larger intronic sequence at the 5'-end and an exon upstream of the exon identified by Murphy. Therefore, the TSS and the gene promoter were identified on the base of said sequence, by localizing the FPR2/ALX transcription start site (TSS) and mapping a core promoter sequence of 346 bp. More in details, SEQ. ID. NO.1 is the FPR2/ALX gene structure reported by Murphy, wherein capital letters indicate the open reading frame: whereas SEQ. ID. NO.2 is the FPR2/ALX sequence utilized for the present invention, wherein capital letters indicate the open reading frame: Theoretically, the promoter should have mapped upstream of the open reading frame or of the exon of the above SEQ. ID. NO. 1, but the gene promoter was never identified in the Murphy's sequence. On the contrary, the inventors identified the core promoter sequence because they designed an alternative strategy, based on the reconstitution of the asset of the FPR2/ALX gene through the identification of the mRNA more abundant in cells (Figure 1A). This approach led to the discovery that post-transcriptional editing links the 5'-end of the open reading frame to the 3'-end of an exon, which is localized way upstream of the exon initially reported by Murphy. This approach enabled the inventors to design the strategy to map the FPR2/ALX promoter. The first step was to localize the TSS by 5' rapid amplification of DNA ends (RACE) analysis. Due to the relatively low abundance of FPR2/ALX mRNA species, the manufacturer's instructions provided with the 5' RACE kit (Invitrogen) were modified in using a gene specific reverse primer, instead of the Oligo dT reverse primer indicated by the manufacturer, in order to amplify the mature mRNA species to which an RNA oligo had been ligated at the 5' end. This modification permitted the enrichment of the FPR2/ALX mRNA sequences, thus minimizing the amplification of non-specific mRNAs and allowing the correct TSS mapping. Once localized the TSS, a 1500 bp sequence upstream the TSS was cloned into a reporter plasmid and tested for promoter activity. Said sequence showed strong luciferase activity in reporter gene assay. The chromatin immuno-precipitation revealed the presence of an Sp1 binding site within the core promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of this site and Sp1 overexpression showed that this transcription factor is key for maximal promoter activity, which is instead inhibited by DNA methylation. A single nucleotide mutation, -220 bp from the TSS, was detected in a subject with history of cardiovascular disease and in his two daughters. This mutation reduced by ~ 35-90% the promoter activity in vitro. Consistent with this, individuals carrying this mutation displayed respectively - 10 and 3 fold reduction in FPR2/ALX mRNA and protein levels in PMN compared to normal subjects and their relatives without the mutation. The inventors of the present invention also provided evidence of mutations that affect FPR2/ALX expression at the transcriptional level and are correlated with inflammatory disorders. Moreover, the inventors of the present invention found that the full promoter sequence (P-1500) comprises repressive sequences whose activation has a repressive effect on the activity of the promoter and, therefore, the expression of FPR2/ALX can be inhibited by repressive complexes likely operating upstream of the core promoter. In the field of pharmaceutical and more in particular of personalized medicine, there is a strong felt need of screening assay for new anti-inflammatory molecules and od diagnostic tools for detecting the presence and/or the risk of developing inflammatory diseases or events. The identification of the FPR2/ALX promoter and of the mutation related to inflammatory diseases allowed to obtain a cellular expression system useful for the screening of molecules, which influence the promoter and affect FPR2/ALX expression. Furthermore, said system is useful for assessing if a subject is at risk of inflammatory diseases and cardiovascular diseases in particular, and their responsiveness to drugs. Object of the invention Object of the present invention are the promoter sequences of the FPR2/ALX gene is the wild type sequence or a methylated form of the wild type sequence or a wild type sequence mutated in the Sp1 binding site or containing a SNP and the expression vectors and cell lines comprising said sequences. A further object of the present invention is the use of the above sequences as a tool in a screening system for anti-inflammatory drug discovery, wherein the screening system comprises a cell line transfected with a vector comprising a core promoter sequence wild type or mutated and a reporter gene. Further object of the present invention is a method for identifying active ingredients for preventing or treating inflammatory diseases comprising a step of adding said active ingredient to the screening system and a step of detecting the activity of said active ingredient on the expression of the reporter gene. Still another object of the present invention is a method for determining whether a subject has, or is at risk of developing inflammatory diseases, comprising determining the presence or absence of a variant allele A/G of nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the core promoter sequence wherein homozygosis or heterozygosis for the G allele indicates that the individual is at risk for cardiovascular disease. A further object of the present invention is a method for predicting the responsiveness of a subject at risk of having or developing an inflammatory disease and/or an inflammatory event, to a drug stimulating the activity of the FPR2/ALX gene promoter comprising a step of adding said active ingredient to two screening system, wherein one expressing the wild type and the other expressing the FPR2/ALX gene promoter sequence with a SNP, in parallel; a step of detecting the responsiveness of the wild type and promoter sequence with a SNP to said active ingredient and a step of comparing the expression of the reporter gene in the cell line expressing the wild type with the expression of the reporter gene in the cell line expressing promoter sequence with a SNP. A further object of the present invention are kits comprising the screening system suitable reagents for their use together, sequentially and separately. Further characteristics of the present invention would be clear from the following detailed description with reference to the experimental examples and the attached sheets of drawings.

Examples Example 1 Analysis of FPR2/ALX transcripts in human cell lines Human acute monocytic leukemia cells, THP1, were cultured at starting density of 2x105/mL in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI 1640, PAA, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% vol/vol fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, San Giuliano Milanese, Italy), 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin (P/S). Cells were cultured at 37 °C, 100% humidity and 5% CO2. Human breast cancer MDA-MB231 cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, PAA) containing high glucose (4.5 g/L at 25 mM) and supplemented with 100 U/mL P/S, and 10% vol/vol FBS. Total RNA was isolated from 80% confluent MDA-MB 231 using Rneasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using 100 ng of total RNA. The reaction was performed in a final volume of 20 µl using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Sigma-Aldrich). Primers For C (5' GGG CTT GAT TGC GTG GC 3' (SEQ ID NO: 29)) and Rev C (5' TCA GAC AGG GCC CTC TC 3' (SEQ ID NO: 30)) were designed to amplify a sequence of 524 bp located respectively at the 5' and 3' UTRs of the FPR2/ALX gene. PCR reaction mixtures contained 100 ng of forward and reverse primers, 10 ng cDNA, 0.2 mM dNTPs, Taq DNA polymerase buffer, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich). Mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of amplification (60 seconds at 95°C ; 60 s at 52°C; 60 seconds at 72°C). Products were separated by gel electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel, visualized by ethidium bromide staining and analysed using the Chemi Doc System (Bio-Rad). The FPR2/ALX mRNA sequences expressed in the human cell lines MDA-MB231 and THP1 were determined by RT-PCR. As expected, we detected the full-length 1056 bp transcript of the open reading frame, initially reported by Murphy (Figure 1A, top and SEQ. ID. NO. 1). However, we also detected in both cell types a 524 bp product encopassing the first exon and part of the open reading frame of the sequence c in figure 1A. These results indicate this last sequence is the only to give complete mRNA sequences in MDA-MB231 and THP1 cells. Therefore, we focused on this sequence to map the FPR2/ALX transcription start site (TSS). Example 2 Identification of the TSS Table 1 reports all the sequences of primers used in examples 1-6.

NO. 30Rev C5' TCA GAC AGG GCC CTC TC 3' To localize the TSS of FPR2/ALX, a RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5' end (RLM-RACE) strategy was used to obtain the full-length cDNA sequence at the 5' end, using the GeneRacerTM (Invitrogen) kit. Briefly, 5 µg of total RNA from THP1 cells was used to prepare 5'-racing cDNA. The first- strand cDNA was amplified using universal forward For Gene Race and reverse gene-specific primer Rev TSS (Table 1). An aliquot of the PCR products was used as template for a nested reaction with the For Gene RACE nested and Rev TSS Nested primers (Table 1). The agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products obtained with the For Gene Race and Rev TSS Race outer primers revealed a weak band of the expected size. This band was further amplified by nested PCR using the For Gene Race Nested and Rev TSS Nested primers. The 5'-RACE-nested PCR gave a single DNA fragment (Figure 1 D) that was cloned and sequenced. The TSS was identified by sequence analysis and mapped 65 bp upstream the ATG translation codon inside exon 1 (SEQ. ID. NO.31) Example 3 - FPR2/ALX promoter activity in human cell lines Having localized the TSS, a 1500 bp fragment of human genomic DNA (-1449/+51 from the TSS) was amplified by PCR, cloned into the promoterless pGL3 vector containing the luciferase reporter gene. For this purpose, Genomic DNA was extracted from the THP1 cells using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy). Two primers, (For 1500 bp e Rev 1500 bp, Table 1) were designed on the basis of genomic DNA sequence of 5'- flanking region of the FPR2/ALX gene to amplify a section of DNA starting -1449 bp upstream of the identified transcription start site (+1). In addition to the template (100 ng of genomic DNA) and primers For 1500 bp and Rev 1500 bp (100 ng), the reaction mixture contained 0.2 mM dNTPs, Pfu DNA polymerase buffer and 0,05 units of Jumpstart Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich), PCR consisted of 35 cycles of amplification (30 seconds at 94°C, 30 s at 52°C, and 120 seconds at 72°C). PCR products were recovered from low melting agarose gel and used as template in PCR reactions using primers For 1500 and Rev 1500, added of Kpn I and Xho I restriction sites, respectively (Table 1). PCR products were resolved by 1.5% agarose gel elecrophoresis, purified and ligated into the pGL3-basic reporter vector, which was previously digested with Kpn I and Xho I restriction endonuclease. The resulting plasmid was designated P-1500 bp and was sequenced to verify insertion and correct orientation of the cloned sequence. The promoter activity of the construct was analyzed by transfection into MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cells. Figures 2 shows the relative luciferase activity of the reporter construct. A slightly higher activity was detected in MDA-MB231 cells (18 fold over empty vector) compared to MCF7 cells (14 fold over empty vector). Therefore, said cell line was selected for further studies. The 1500 bp sequence was scanned using the MATInspector software for the presence of putative transcription factor binding sites. Canonical TATA (-92 bp) and CAAT (-144 bp) boxes and a putative binding site for Sp1 (-234 bp) were revealed and further investigated for their functional relevance. To this end, different length sequences of the 5' flanking region were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGL3 basic vector. The 1500 bp DNA fragment was used as template to make PCR products of sequences between -307/+39 bp (P-346), -230/+39 (P-269), -145/+39 (P-184),-1450/-450 (P-1000), -640/-340 (P-300), -84/+39 (P-123), - 32/+39 (P-71) (Figure 3A). These DNA-fragments were subcloned into pGL3 and the resulting constructs were sequenced to ensure fidelity of amplification. The above constructs were transfected into MDA-MB231 cells and tested for promoter activity. As shown in Figure 3, P-346, encompassing Sp1, CCAT and TATA binding sites, showed the highest promoter activity, ~100 fold over empty vector. This activity was completely lost when the sequence was cloned in reverse, indicating directionality of this promoter. Constructs P-1000 and P-300, localized upstream P-346, did not induce significant activity, while plasmids P-269, encompassing CCAT and TATA boxes, and P-184, encompassing only TATA binding sites, showed ~20 and ~15 fold luciferase activity over empty vector, respectively. Construct P-123, which did not contain Sp1, CCAT and TATA binding sites, had ~15 fold promoter activity over the pGL3 basic vector. Finally, P-71 did not show significant promoter activity. The results identify P-346 as core promoter and indicate that Sp1 may play a key role in the FPR2/ALX transcription machinery. Example 4 - Analysis of Sp1 binding and function A reporter plasmid expressing P-346 with mutated Sp1 binding site was generated using mutagenic primers (For Sp1 and Rev Sp1, Table 1). Both primers annealed to the same target sequence on opposite strands of P-346. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and the resulting plasmid was designated P-346 bp Sp1-mut. A reporter plasmid expressing the (A/G) SNP at -220 from the TSS in the FPR2/ALX promoter was generated using a 5'-primer annealing to -229/-213 bp from the TSS. Primers For Mut pt and Rev Mut pt (Table 1) annealed to the same target sequence on opposite strands of P-346 and the site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described above. The resulting plasmid was designated P-346 bp mut pt. CHIP-IT Kit (Active Motif) was used to study protein/DNA interactions. Briefly, MDA-MB231 cells were crosslinked for 10 minutes at room temperature with fixation solution. Cells were scraped off and homogenized with a dounce homogenizer. Cell lysates were centrifuged (5000 rpm, 10 minutes, 4°C) to isolate the nuclear fraction, which was suspended in shearing buffer, supplemented with protease inhibitors. After sonication on ice (10 pulses of 20 seconds) and centrifugation, supernatants were diluted in ChlP buffer and pre-cleared with Protein G beads (2 hours, 4°C). An aliquot (10 µl) of pre-cleared chromatin was stored at -20°C as "Input DNA". The supernatant was divided into three aliquots. One aliquot did not receive antibodies (negative control), the other two received either RNA pol II antibody or Sp1-specific antibody (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany). After incubation (16 hours, 4°C) on a rotating wheel, protein G beads were added to each of the antibody/chromatin incubations, which were kept under rotation for 1.5 hours at 4°C. Immunoprecipitated DNA was eluted from the washed Protein G beads and cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65°C overnight. The eluates were digested with proteinase K at 42°C for 2 hours and the DNA was purified using mini-columns provided with the ChlP-IT Kit. The FPR2/ALX promoter region was amplified by PCR using 5'-GCTGAAACTCTTCCCACTTC-3' (forward) (SEQ.ID.NO. 37) and 5'-GAGACTGGAGTTCATGCTTC-3' (reverse) (SEQ.ID.NO. 32) primers which cover the FPR2/ALX promoter from -345 bp to -225 bp from the TSS. For additional control, 197 bp of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was PCR amplified using the GAPDHf and GAPDHr primers provided with kit. PCR products were visualized after separation on 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 % ethidium bromide. In order to assess Sp1 binding to the FPR2/ALX promoter, we immunoprecipitated sheared chromatin with an Sp1-specific antibody and then carried out PCR amplification of a 120 bp sequence (-345 to -225 from the TSS) that included the putative Sp1 binding site. As shown in Figure 4A, we obtained a specific PCR product of the expected size, confirming SP1 binding to the predicted site in the FPR2/ALX promoter. Next, we examined the transactivation capacity of Sp1. To this end, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of the SP1 binding site (GG at -238 bp from the TSS was replaced with TT) (Figure 4B) SEQ. ID. NO. 33 SEQ. ID. NO. 34 and cloned the mutated sequence into a reporter plasmid (mut SP1), which was transfected into MDA-MB 231 cells. This mutation significantly reduced (P = 0.01) promoter activity of wt P-346 (Figure 4C). To obtain further evidence of the role played by Sp1 in the regulation of FPR2/ALX activity, we co-transfected an expression plasmid encoding for human Sp1 (pEVR2/Sp1) and P-346 into MDA-MB231 cells and determined the reporter gene activity. As shown in Figure 4C, the Sp1-expressing plasmid enhanced significantly the promoter activity of P-346 (P = 0.026), but it did not increase the activity of mutated P-346. Example 5 - Regulatory mechanisms of the FPR2/ALX promoter We next investigated epigenetic regulation of FPR2/ALX promoter activity. Although in silico analysis did not reveal CpG motifs within the P-1500, a number of potential targets for Hpall (CCGG motifs) and Sssl (CpG dinucleotides) methylases was found. Therefore P-1500 and P-346 were methylated in vitro. To this end, Four micrograms of plasmid DNA were incubated (16 h, 37 °C) with 0.8 units/µg of the methylases Hpall (Fermentas, Opelstrasse Germany), Sssl (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) and Hhal in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2,1 mM DTT, and 800 µM of S-adenosylmethionine. Methylation was confirmed by plasmid digestion with the restriction enzymes Hpall, BstUI and Hhal. The methylated plasmids were purified by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) and transfected into MDA-MB231 as described above. Cells were transfected with 2 µg of P-346 and were used equimolar amounts of other plasmids. Luciferase activity was measured as decribed above. Hpall and Sssl methylated P-1500 as well as P-346 in vitro and suppressed promoter activity (Figure 5). In contrast, only one predicted target for the Hhal methylase (GCGC motif) was found in P-1500 and none in P-346. Indeed, Hhal did not give appreciable methylation and promoter activity inhibition (results not shown). In accordance with data in Figure 5, the de-methylating agent 5-aza-dC increased both FPR2/ALX mRNA (by -10 fold) and protein (~ 3 fold) expression in MDA-MB231 cells (Figures 6A and B). For 5-aza- 2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) treatment, cells were seeded in 100 mm tissue culture dish and maintained for 96 h. 5-aza-dC was added after 24 h, and cells were incubated for 72 h with culture medium replaced every 24 h. Expression of GPCRs can be upregulated by the relative agonists. For example, LTB4 increases mRNA and protein expression of the LTB4 receptor 1 (BLT1) in endothelial cells (Qiu, H., A.S. Johansson, M. Sjöström, M.Wan, O. Schröder, J. Palmblad, and J.Z. Haeggström. 2006. Differential induction of BLT receptor expression on human endothelial cells by lipopolysaccharide, cytokines, and leukotriene B4. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 103:6913-6918). Moreover, FPR2/ALX cellular expression can be enhanced by corticosteroids (Sawmynaden, P., and M. Perretti. 2006. Glucocorticoid upregulation of the annexin-A1 receptor in leukocytes. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 349:1351-1355) and cytokines (Gronert, K., A. Gewirtz, J.L. Madara, and C.N. Serhan. 1998. Identification of a human enterocyte lipoxin A4 receptor that is regulated by interleukin (IL)-13 and interferon gamma and inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced IL-8 release. J Exp Med 187:1285-1294). Therefore, we examined the impact of LXA4 (primary FPR2/ALX agonist) as well as of corticosteroids and cytokines on the activity of the FPR2/ALX promoter. To this end, we transfected MDA-MB231 cells with P-1500 and P-346 for 24 hours before exposure to LXA4 (10 nM), dexametasone (1 µM), gamma interferon (IFN-γ) (5-100 nM), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (500 nM). Only LXA4 significantly enhanced luciferase activity of p-1500 and P-346 and enhanced FPR2/ALX mRNA levels (Figure 7), whereas the other agents did not give appreciable changes (results not shown). Example 6 - Identification of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the FPR2/ALX promoter In light of the emerging pathophysiological relevance of FPR2/ALX in human disease, the inventors asked whether genetic variants of the identified promoter sequence could be found in humans. Therefore, the core promoter in DNA from 100 healthy individuals and 100 patients with history of acute cardiovascular events was sequenced, in consideration of the documented protective action of the LXA4/LXA4 receptor in the vascular district (Chiang, N., C.N. Serhan, S.E. Dahlen, J.M. Drazen, D.W. Hay, G.E. Rovati, T. Shimizu, T. Yokomizo, and C. Brink. 2006. The lipoxin receptor ALX: potent ligand-specific and stereoselective actions in vivo. Pharmacol Rev 58:463-487). The analysis of polymorphisms was carried out by means of the following protocol: genomic DNA of 132 patients with acute coronary ischemia available from the Monzino Cardiologic Institute (Milan, Italy) and from 100 healthy subjects recruited at the Functional Genomic Unit of the Center of Excellence on Aging (Chieti, Italy) was sequenced following PCR amplification of the FPR2/ALX 5'flanking region. Two primers, For 346 bp and Rev 346 bp (Table 1), complementary to P-346 were used to amplify a portion of DNA starting - 306 bp upstream of the identified TSS (+1). PCR products were purified and sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Each PCR product was sequenced both in the forward and in the reverse strand. Detected mutations were confirmed by repeating the sequencing on a new PCR product. We found no mutations in healthy subjects. On the contrary, one patient with pregress acute coronary ischemia and affected by metabolic syndrome was heterozygous for a single base mutation (A/G) at -220 bp upstream the TSS. To evaluate the impact of this genetic variant on the promoter activity, the wild type core promoter was mutated in vitro introducing the A/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). (SEQ ID. NO: 35) (SEQ ID. NO: 36) Remarkably, the mutated construct (P-346 pt mut) showed ~ 35% reduction in promoter activity compared to the wild type P-346 when transfected into MDA-MB231 cells. This reduction reached ~ 90% when the mutant was transfected into the human airway cell line 16HBE14o- (Figure 8). The cells were grown to confluence in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM, PAA) with Earle's balanced salt solution, supplemented with 10% FBS vol/vol and 100 U/ml P/S on 100 mm plates coated with fibronectin and collagen. Gene sequence analysis of DNA from the proband relatives revealed that his two daughters both carried the A/G 220 variant in heterozygosis, whereas two brothers and one sister expressed the wt allele. The parents could not be genotyped because were deceased. Therefore FPR2/ALX mRNA and protein expression in PMN from these individuals as well from age and sex-matched normal individuals was evaluated. Blood samples were collected into citric acid-citrate-dextrose (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for leukocyte isolation and RNA extraction and into a citrate containing Vacutainer® tube (1/10 vol sodium citrate 0.129 mol/L, Becton Dickinson) for whole blood flow cytometry analysis. Blood leukocytes were separated by Ficoll-Histopaque/Dextran sedimentation. To carry out the quantitative real-time PCR, total RNA was isolated from MDA-MB231 or circulating PMN using Rneasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Sigma-Aldrich). Quantitative PCR was performed with an ABI PRISM 7900 HT real time PCR thermal cycler. Duplicates were set up for each sample and the expression of FPR2/ALX mRNA was quantified by the comparative ΔΔCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001), using FPR2/ALX assay on demand Applied Biosystem, (Hs 00265954_m1). Ct values were normalized using TaqManTM GAPDH assay on demand by Applied Biosystem,( Hs 99999905_m1) as housekeeping gene. For the evaluation of FPR2/ALX protein expression in PMN, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at 4°C and permeabilized with BD Permeabilizing Solution 2 (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for 10 minutes at room temperature. For each staining 5 x 105 cells were incubated with anti-FPR2/ALX (Genovac GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) (30 minutes, 4°C), followed by fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in the same buffer (30 minutes, 4°C). Secondary antibody-matched controls were used to assess unspecific fluorescence. Samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flowcytometer (Becton Dickinson) and data were analyzed using CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson). We observed that the three subjects heterozygous for the A/G 220 variant had lower levels of FPR2/ALX mRNA and protein in blood PMN compared to their wt relatives, who showed expression levels comparable to those observed in healthy individuals, age- and sex- matched.
