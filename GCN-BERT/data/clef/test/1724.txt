No. 7,816,379), which claims priority to KR10-2003-0093342 and KR10-2004-0058809, the full disclosure of each of these documents is incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field The present invention relates to novel derivatives of oxazolidinone, preparation methods of the same, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same for use in an antibiotic. 2. Description of the Related Art Used as orally administrable antibacterial agents, oxazolidinone compounds are not products of fermentation, but artificially synthesized ones, and various structures of their derivatives are known. For instance, 3-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone derivatives having one or two substituents are stated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,948,801, 4,461,773, 4,340,606, 4,476,136, 4,250,318 and 4,128,654. 3-[(Monosubstituted) phenyl]-2-oxazolidinone derivatives of Formula 2 are disclosed in EP 0312000, J. Med. Chem. 32, 1673 (1989), J. Med. Chem. 33, 2569 (1990), Tetrahedron, 45, 123 (1989), etc. Pharmacia & Upjohn developed oxazolidinone derivatives of Formulas 3 and 4 (WO 93/23384, WO 95/14684 and WO 95/07271). Having succeeded in gaining the approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of U.S.A., the oxazolidinone derivative of Formula 3, by the name of ‘Zyvox’, has come into the market. However, these conventional synthetic oxazolidinone compounds were found to suffer from the disadvantage of showing antibacterial activity against a narrow spectrum of bacteria, being toxic to humans, and being poor in therapeutic activity in vivo. Zyvox may be used restrictively as injection since the solubility of Zyvox against water is inadequate for use in injection, which is about 3 mg/ml. Further, WO 93/09103 discloses derivatives of phenyl oxazolidinone, substituted with heterocyclics such as thiazole, indole, oxazole and quinole, as well as pyridine, at position 4 of the phenyl ring. However, these derivatives of oxazolidinone are known as providing insufficient medicinal effects because the heterocyclics bear simple substituents such as alkyl or amino groups. In WO 01/94342, synthesizing derivatives of phenyl oxazolidinone, having with pyridine or derivatives of phenyl at position 4 of the phenyl ring was described. The compounds synthesized are potent in inhibitory activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria and are also superior antibiotic to Zyvox. However, The compounds are unable to be formulated as injection because solubility of the same is under 30 μg/ml. Accordingly, the intensive and thorough research on oxazolidinone derivatives, conducted by the present inventors aiming to overcome the above problems encountered in prior arts, resulted in the finding oxazolidinone derivatives as well as prodrugs thereof, wherein the prodrugs are prepared by reacting amino acid or phosphate with the oxazolidinone derivatives having hydroxyl group. Further, salts of the oxazolidinone derivatives prodruged were easily synthesized by using amine group of amino acid of the same to synthesize organic acid or inorganic acid and by using a hydroxyl group of phosphate and one selected from sodium and calcium. The oxazolidinone derivatives have excellent effects on antibiotic activity and the solubility of the same is greatly enhanced.

Further, the present invention provides a method of preparing the derivatives of oxazolidinone corresponding to Formula 1, as shown in Scheme 1 is defined below. In the Scheme 1, Z represents C1-4 alkyl group, X, R1, R1′, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined in Formula 1 and Y represents halogen. The method of preparing the derivatives of oxazolidinone according to the present invention comprises: substituting a halogen atom for a hydrogen atom on phenyl of a derivative (II) of hydroxymethyloxazolidinone thereby to form a derivative (III) (Step 1);substituting stannyl for a halogen atom (Y) of the derivative (III) to form a derivative (IV) (Step 2);reacting the derivative (IV) with pyridine or phenyl derivative that is substituted to bromine or iodine to form a derivative (V) of oxazolidinone having pyridine ring or phenyl ring (Step 3); andreacting the derivative (V) with amino acid having a protecting group and then with acid thereby to eliminate the protecting group and to form salts of the compounds corresponding to Formula 1, or subjecting the derivative (V) to react with phosphate and then with metallic salt thereby to form salts of the compounds corresponding to Formula 1 (Step 4). In the Step 1, the derivative (II) of hydroxymethyloxazolidinone may be synthesized by conventional methods. For example, a method may comprise substituting an amino group of anilin for a benzyloxycarbonyl group and reacting a substituted compound with glycidylbutylate in a state of strong bases thereby to form the derivative (II). The state may be prepared by adding a strong base; preferably the strong base may include n-butyllitium, sec-butyllitium, tert-butyllitium, etc., more preferably n-butyllitium. Further, it is preferable to subject the method at a temperature of about −78° C. in liquid nitrogen. The Step 1 is subjected to substitute a hydrogen atom of phenyl group of the derivative (II) for a halogen atom, preferably for an iodine atom. When the hydrogen atom is substituted for the iodine atom, the substituted reaction may be subjected preferably by adding iodine monochloride (ICI) or trifluoroacetic acid silver salt (CF3COOAg) and adding iodine at room temperature. The Step 2 is subjected the derivative (III) to react with hexamethylditin, hexabutylditin or tributyltin hydride by adding a catalyst of palladium to form the derivative (IV) of which iodine atom is substituted for a trimethylstannyl group or a tributylstannyl group. The catalyst of palladium may comprise dichlorobistriphenylphosphine palladium (II), tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium (0), etc. It is preferred to carry out the Step 2 in a solvent of 1,4-dioxan, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, 1-methyl-2-pyrolidone, etc. at a temperature of about 90 to 150° C. The Step 3 is carried out by reacting the derivative (IV) with a compound having hetero ring on phenyl or pyridine ring thereby to form the derivative (V). A catalyst of palladium added in the Step 3 may be identical to that of palladium in Step 2. It is preferred to carry out the Step 3 in a solvent of dimethylformamide, 1-methyl-2-pyrolidone, etc. at a temperature of about 100 to 120° C. The Step 4 is performed by reacting the derivative (V) with amino acid that is protecting an amino group with t-butyloxycarbonyl, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 4-dimethylaminopyridine thereby to form the derivative (I) having amino group. The amino acid may include alanine, glycine, proline, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, β-alanine, valine, etc. A solvent comprises dimethylformamide, 1-methyl-2-pyrolidone, etc. Preferably, a reaction by adding the derivative (V) with amino acid is carried out by stirring for about 5 hours above at room temperature. A mixture of the derivative (V) and amino acid reacts to a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, etc. to eliminate a protecting group. The solvent is removed from the mixture and the mixture is crystallized thereby to provide a salt of the derivative of oxazolidinone corresponding to Formula 1. Preferably, a reaction by adding the derivative (V) with amino acid is carried out by stirring for about 2 hours above at room temperature. The salt of the derivative of formula 1, prepared by using amino acid at position R3 or R4, in a method known similarly to the above method, may be gained. (S)-3-(4-trimethylstannyl-3-fluorophenyl)-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinylmethyl acetamide as a starting material in the method is known and the method is described in WO0194342. Further, a phosphate metallic salt of the derivative (I) may be formed by adding sodiummethoxide, sodium hydroxide, etc. to a composition in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol etc., the composition is prepared by dissolving the derivative (V) in trimethylphosphate or triethylphosphate, adding phosphorous oxy chloride and stirring for about 12 hours at room temperature. The phosphate metallic salt may be produced by reacting the derivative (V) with tetrazole and derivates of amidite at room temperature, oxidizing a reacted compound, synthesizing a derivative of alkylphosphate, eliminating alkyl group using a strong acid thereby to form a derivative of phosphate acid, and converting the derivative of phosphate acid into the phosphate metallic salt by the above-mentioned method. Further, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the derivatives of oxazolidinone corresponding to Formula 1 for use in an antibiotic. The oxazolidinone derivatives of the present invention show inhibitory activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) and have excellent relatively antibiotic activity with a relatively low concentration thereof or in vivo. Further, the derivatives of the present invention may exert potent antibacterial activity versus various human and animal pathogens, including Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococi, Enterococci and Streptococi, anaerobic microorganisms such as Bacteroides and Clostridia, and acid-resistant microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium. The derivatives of oxazolidinone, having hydroxyl, are reacted with amino acid or phosphate to form prodrugs thereof. The prodrugs have superior solubility to compounds that are not formed as prodrugs: the solubility of the prodrugs represents above 28 mg/ml and the solubility of the compound 10 mg/ml (compound 10). The prodrugs stabilize in water or acidic solution and change to hydroxylmethyl compounds by being reverted using esterase and phosphatase in a blood thereby to develop easy formulation for injection or oral administration. The composition of the present invention may comprise at least one effective ingredient having functions similar to those of the derivatives of oxazolidinone. For formulating a pharmaceutical composition, at least one specie of the compound of formula 1 may be admixed with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical acceptable carrier may include saline solution, sterile water, Ringer's solution, buffered saline solution, dextrose solution, malto-dextrin solution, glycerol, ethanol, etc. According to the user's necessity, the pharmaceutical composition may contain conventional expedient such as antioxidizing agent, buffer, soil cleaner, etc. Also, the compositions are admixed with diluents, disintegrants, surface active agents, binders, lubricants, aqueous solution, suspension, etc. to be formed for injection, powders, capsules, granules, tablet, etc. Preferably, the formulation is prepared using proper methods described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Science (the newest edition), Mack Publishing Company, Easton Pa., etc. according to diseases or ingredients. The compound of the present invention may be administrated orally or parenterally, such as intravenously, hypodermically, intra-abdominally, topically, etc. The dosage of the compound may vary depending upon the particular compound utilized, the mode of administration, the condition, and severity thereof, of the condition being treated, as well as the various physical factors related to the individual being treated. As used in accordance with invention, satisfactory results may be obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered to the individual in need at a daily dosage of about 10 mg to about 25 mg per kilogram of body weight, preferably about 13 mg to about 20 mg per kilogram of body weight, more preferably administered each of divided doses to many times per day. The Lethal Dose (LD50) of the oxazolidinone derivatives shows above 1 g/kg in test of acute toxicity so that the derivatives are found stable. (a) Advantageous Effects The oxazolidinone derivatives of the present invention show inhibitory activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria and lower toxicity. The prodrugs, prepared by reacting the compound having hydroxyl with amino acid or phosphate, have high solubility thereof against water. Further, the derivatives of the present invention may exert potent antibacterial activity versus various human and animal pathogens, including Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococi, Enterococci and Streptococi, anaerobic microorganisms such as Bacteroides and Clostridia, and acid-resistant microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium.
