Technical field The present invention relates to a process for preparing an aminoalkyl phenylcarbamate (4), comprising the steps of converting a hydroxy phenyl ketone (2) to a phenylcarbamate ketone (3), and converting the phenylcarbamate ketone (3) to the desired aminoalkyl phenylcarbamate (4). Optionally the aminoalkyl phenylcarbamate (4) may be resolved into its enantiomers and/or converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The invention allows access to aminoalkyl phenylcarbamates (4) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts prepared by the above process, in particular, to rivastigmine (1) and rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate (9). The aminoalkyl phenylcarbamates (4) may be comprised in pharmaceutical compositions. The aminoalkyl phenylcarbomates (4), prepared by a process of the present invention, may be used in a method of inhibiting acetylcholine esterase or treating dementia, senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, tardive dyskinesias, hyperkinesia, a confusion disorder, ataxia, Friedrich's ataxia, Down's syndrome, mania or an acute confusion disorder. Background art Certain aminoalkyl phenylcarbamates are selective acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and are therefore potentially useful as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of brain disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, tardive dyskinesias, confusion disorders and ataxia. One such compound, the hydrogen tartrate salt of (S)-N-ethyl,methyl-3-[1-(dimethylamino)ethyl]phenylcarbamate (rivastigmine (1)), is marketed as a pharmaceutical for the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Processes for the preparation of these types of phenylcarbamates are described in US 4 948 807, US 5 602 176, WO 2004/037771, Journal of Labelled Compounds and Radiopharmaceuticals (1997, vol. 39(8), pages 651-668), and Beilstein nos. RID 8695727, RID 816415 and RID 771876. Aminoalkyl phenylcarbamates are also described in Beilstein nos. BRN 3652483, BRN 3646129, BRN 3644242, BRN 3340624, BRN 3331553, BRN 3283495, BRN 3205503, BRN 9449166 and BRN 9030136. Other types of carbamates are described in WO 00/14057, and Beilstein nos. RID 945119 and BRN 3101218. However, these known processes are not satisfactory, particularly for industrial scale manufacture, as they have been found to involve zwitterionic intermediates, which are very water soluble and need to be isolated by concentration of the aqueous solvent. Other disadvantages of the processes are that they tend to leave large amounts of sulphated ash as residues and that pyrophoric and hazardous reagents such sodium hydride are employed.

Brief description of the drawings The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: Figure One shows a general reaction scheme illustrating the process of the present invention.Figure Two shows a reaction scheme illustrating a preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention.Figure Three shows a reaction scheme illustrating an alternative embodiment of the process of the present invention. Detailed description of the invention The inventors have found that the preparation of aminoalkyl phenylcarbamates is greatly improved by the process outlined in the scheme of Figure One, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are the same or different and can be as previously defined, preferably an alkyl group. Alternatively, R1-R2 and/or R3-R4 together form a ring. The process outlined in the scheme of Figure One is short, utilises readily available hydroxy phenyl ketones (2) as starting materials and does not require any hazardous chemical reagents. Each step of the process is high yielding and affords products of very high purity. Therefore the current invention provides a process for the preparation of aminoalkyl phenylcarbamates by a process comprising the steps specified in the scheme of Figure One. A preferred embodiment of the invention is a process for the preparation of rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate (9), as outlined in the scheme of Figure Two. The process of the invention, embodied by the process depicted in the scheme of Figure Two, avoids the problems of prior art processes as no zwitterionic intermediates are involved and consequently the intermediates can be efficiently isolated by extraction. The sulphated ash residues in the process of the invention are less than 0.1%, whereas in the prior art processes the sulphated ash residues can be greater than 20%. In addition, the process according to the invention avoids the use of pyrophoric and hazardous reagents such as sodium hydride and preferably replaces this reagent with less expensive and safer reagents such as potassium carbonate (see, for example, step (a) in the scheme of Figure Two). Figure Three shows a reaction scheme illustrating an alternative embodiment of the process of the present invention. The invention allows access to rivastigmine (1) and/or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts when prepared by a process according to the current invention. In a preferred embodiment rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate (9) is prepared by a process according to the invention. The processes outlined in the schemes of Figures Two and Three are examples of procedures comprising the process of the current invention and detailed procedures for these processes are found in the experimental procedures outlined below. Experimental details - Figure Two 3-O-((N-ethyl,methyl)carbamoyl)acetophenone (7) Acetone (1000ml) was charged in a flask equipped with a reflux condenser and mechanical stirrer. 3'-Hydroxyacetophenone (6) (125g, 0.919mol) was added with stirring at ambient temperature. This gave a yellow clear coloured solution. Potassium carbonate (381g, 2.757mol, 3eq) was added in one lot followed by addition of ethyl methyl carbamoyl chloride (EMCC, 167.5g, 1.379mol, 1.5eq) also in one lot. Acetone (250ml) used to rinse the addition funnel was added to the reaction. The reaction mixture was then heated to reflux (55°C). After 4 hours, potassium carbonate (25.5g, 0.18mol, 0.2eq) was added in one lot followed by acetone (92ml, 0.74 volumes). One hour after this addition, potassium carbonate (12.75g, 0.09mol, 0.1eq) was added in one lot. The reaction mass was allowed to cool to about 35°C and filtered though a sintered funnel under vacuum. The solid was discarded and the mother liquor was concentrated to obtain crude ketone (7) as a red coloured liquid. Yield: 229g, 112.74%. HPLC purity: 96.71%.

Concentrated hydrochloric acid (conc. HCl, 213ml, 2.04mol, 2eq) was added over 30 minutes. The temperature rose to about 8°C. Ketone (7) (225g, 1.02mol, 1eq) was added as one lot to the reaction mixture at 8-10°C. NaCNBH3 (44.867g, 0.714mol, 0.7eq) was added in one lot and the reaction mixture was brought up from 8-10°C to 24-26°C. The reaction mass was stirred for 48 hours after and filtered though a sintered funnel under vacuum. The solid was discarded and the mother liquor was concentrated to obtain 561g. Water (2.251) was added. The pH was about 8 (measured using pH paper). The aqueous solution was acidified with 1:9 dilute HCl (650ml) to pH 2.
