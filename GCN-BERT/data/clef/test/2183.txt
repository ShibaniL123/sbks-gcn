Step 4
To a solution of Compound 17i (6.6g, 10.7mmol) in dimethylacetamide (66 mL) were added cesium carbonate (9.05 g, 27.8 mmol) and 1,2-dibromoethane (2.61 g, 13.9 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of 2mol / L aqueous hydrochloric acid and water. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 18i (6.2 g, 98%) as a colorless foam compound.
