CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application is based on U.S. provisional application No. 61/952,346 filed on Mar. 13, 2014, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Applicant claims the priority of the U.S. provisional application No. 61/952,346. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present disclosure relates generally to racket sports. In particular, the invention relates to a racket sport system and method of play for an aerial projectile game. 2. Background Racket sports are highly participatory sports. Aside from the entertainment value and/or professional endeavor, there are various other reasons why racket sports appeal to individuals. For example, racket sports can be physically and mentally demanding which might appeal to those seeking to challenge and/or strengthen their bodies and minds. Racket sport participants might be drawn to the competitiveness of racket sports. Others might be drawn to the social aspects whereby participants play the same game with others. Moreover, racket sports can help participants improve reaction time and further develop hand-eye coordination. Whatever the reason, racket sports are played throughout the world. Whether for recreational purposes or competing through the sanction of official bodies; Badminton, Tennis, Table Tennis, Racquetball, and/or other racket sports require special courts and/or specific playing areas. Additionally, racket sports often involve a net or a wall. Racket sport participants generally try to maintain an advantage in a rally by maneuvering a projectile in positions that make returning the projectile difficult for their opponent(s). It is accordingly an objective of the present disclosure to provide a new racket sport system and method of play that incorporates some more challenging and/or different aspects and components than typical racket sports, and that can be played on virtually any surface. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A purpose of the invention is to provide a new racket sport system and method of play that integrates unique challenges and/or different aspects and components compared to typical racket sports. The racket sport system generally comprises of two truncated-cone containers, at least two rackets, and a game ball. The truncated-cone containers are components that players target to try to earn points. An advantage of the invention is that the system and method of play combines the use of rackets and a game ball to target containers to earn assisted and/or unassisted points as a team which encourages teamwork, improvement of reaction time, and further development of hand-eye coordination. With the objective of earning twenty-one points, the scoring system includes a one-point assisted play, a two-point unassisted play, a three-point assisted play, and a five-point assisted play. In addition to the scoring system, an immediate-victory-point play is a possibility as well. The immediate-victory-point is an advantageous feature whereby a team can win immediately in any round when a player serves the game ball into the top or front sidewall opening of the targeted container without the assistance from his/her teammate. Another advantage of the invention is the rebuttal feature whereby a team, whose opposing team earned twenty-one points, has a chance to overturn the twenty-one point win by scoring an immediate-victory-point. Another advantage of the invention is the possibility of playing on virtually any surface such as grass, wood, concrete, or snow for example. In use, a preferred embodiment of the invention is operated by two two-player teams in a playing area that is spacious enough for a team of players to serve a game ball as well as move around the targeted containers to receive the game ball for potential assistance. Further challenges and/or different aspects and components of the invention will become apparent from consideration of the drawings and the ensuing description of preferred embodiments of the invention. A person skilled in the art will realize that other embodiments of the invention are possible and that the details of the invention can be modified in a number of respects, all without departing from the inventive concept. Thus, the following drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is a front perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a transparent back perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the present invention; with dotted lines showing the tabs inserted into the corresponding slots, the front sidewall opening, and the bottom of the container. FIG. 3 is a plan view of the preferred embodiment of the container disassembled in a flat state. FIG. 4 is a perspective view of the general arrangement of a game of the present invention, with one player in mid-serve serving to the teammate at the opposing container. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A racket sport system and a method of play for an aerial projectile game generally shown in FIG. 4 are disclosed. The system may generally comprise at least two truncated-cone or pyramid shaped containers 10a, 10b, at least two rackets 17, and a game ball 16 (e.g., wiffleball). Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the truncated containers or pyramid shaped containers 10a, 10b act as the targeted containers whose entry points are the top opening 11 and front sidewall opening 12 of the containers. The method of game play may generally be as shown in FIG. 4, the two targeted containers 10a, 10b may face each other at a predetermined distance and two (or more), two-player teams 20, 21 (although just one-player teams or three-or-more-player teams can play) may take turns serving and receiving the game ball 16 to contact or enter the targeted containers 10a, 10b to score points. For two player teams, one of the two, two-player teams 20, 21 wins by either being the only team to earn exactly twenty-one points (or some other set number of points), by being one of the teams who earn exactly twenty-one points and earns the most points in the overtime round(s), or by being one of teams who scores an immediate-victory-point by serving the game ball 16 into one of the openings of an opposing targeted container without assistance. There are many advantages of such a racket sport system and method of play for an aerial projectile game, such as providing a more challenging and different game than just normal racket sports and that can be played on virtually any surface. There are also many features of a racket sport system and method of play for an aerial projectile game disclosed herein, of which one, a plurality, or all features might be used in any particular implementation. Additionally, in the following description, reference is made to the accompanying FIGS. which form a part hereof, and which show by way of illustration possible implementations. It is to be understood that other implementations may be utilized, and structural, as well as procedural, changes may be made without departing from the scope of this document. As a matter of convenience, various components will be described using exemplary materials, sizes, shapes, styles, dimensions, and the like. However, this document is not limited to the stated examples and other configurations, materials, sizes, shapes, styles, dimensions, and the like and methods are possible and within the teachings of the present disclosure. Components and Features There are a variety of racket sport system implementations for an aerial projectile game. Notwithstanding, for the exemplary purposes of this disclosure and referring to FIGS. 1-4, a specific implementation of a racket sport system and method of play for an aerial projectile game is disclosed. In general, this system may include at least two truncated-cone or pyramid shaped containers (not generally cylindrical), at least two rackets, and a game ball. In reference to FIG. 4, the containers are truncated-cone containers 10a, 10b, the rackets are badminton rackets 17, and the game ball 16 is a wiffleball. In other implementations, the containers could be pyramid shaped containers or some other shaped containers with a base portion that is larger than a top portion. The rackets 17 could also be a different type, style, and/or shape of racket and the game ball 16 could be a different type, style, and/or shape of game ball. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the containers 10a, 10b may or may not have open bottoms 13. When in use on some surfaces, it may be more advantageous to have an open bottom 13 versus a closed bottom, and vice versa. For example, an open bottom 13 may provide more stability on and engagement with a sand, grass, or snow surface for example. For implementations with closed bottoms, an additional gripping or non-slip surface may be included to facilitate stability on and engagement with cement, wood, and other traditional types of flat sports surfaces. The two truncated-cone containers 10a, 10b are the targeted containers and may each have a top opening 11 and a front sidewall opening 12 on the container for game ball 16 entry. Both the top opening 11 and the front sidewall opening 12 may be the same size and shape of openings. For example, they may both be circular openings of the same size. Alternatively, the openings may be of a different size and/or shape from one another in certain other implementations. The top of the container is the narrowest part of the targeted containers 10a, 10b. This makes the game more challenging (e.g., with implementations having a small top opening) as well as providing for a more stable base of the targeted containers (the wider base rests on the play surface and helps prevent the targeted containers from tipping over when hit by the game ball or a player for example). If the containers were cylindrical or an inverted truncated cone or some other similar shape, they would tend to fall over or be knocked over more easily by a player or the game ball. Also, for implementations with an open bottom 13, they would tend to further stabilize the containers in outdoor game areas, such as on grass, loose dirt, sand, snow, and the like for example. The containers may be assembled and disassembled as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. For the exemplary purposes of this disclosure, the containers may removably transition from an unfolded flat state to a folded, ready to use state. The flat state helps with shipping and storage. At any rate, the container may include at least one tab 14 on one edge (in the illustrated implementation there are three tabs 14). A corresponding edge may include at least one slot 15 (in the illustrated implementation there are five slots 15). The tabs 14 on the second edge can be inserted into the corresponding slots 15 on the first edge to form a truncated-cone container. Or they may be pulled out from the slots 15 to revert the containers to an unfolded state. When removably coupled together, the tabs 14 and slots 15 are on the opposite side of the containers where the front openings are located, though they could be located anywhere adjacent the front openings. Alternatively, in some implementations the targeted containers include (instead of tabs 14 and slots 15) snaps, buttons and holes, clamps, hasps, plugs and holes, hooks and loops, or the like components to removably couple the container edges together. Alternatively, in some implementations the containers are not foldable. Instead, they are just integrally formed containers or containers that are formed by affixing their components together. Specification and Materials It will be understood that implementations are not limited to the specific components disclosed herein, as virtually any components consistent with the intended operation of a racket sport system and method of play for an aerial projectile game may be utilized. Accordingly, for example, although particular components and so forth, are disclosed, such components may comprise any configuration, shape, size, style, type, model, version, class, grade, measurement, concentration, material, weight, quantity, and/or the like consistent with the intended operation of a racket sport system and method of play for an aerial projectile game. Implementations are not limited to uses of any specific components; provided that the components selected are consistent with the intended operation of a racket sport system and method of play for an aerial projectile game. Accordingly, the components defining implementations of a racket sport system and method of play for an aerial projectile game may be formed of any of many different types of materials or combinations thereof that can readily be formed into shaped objects having a variety of interior and exterior surface textures provided that the components selected are consistent with the intended operation of a racket sport system and method of play for an aerial projectile game. For example, the components may be formed of: rubbers (synthetic and/or natural) and/or other like materials; glasses (such as fiberglass), carbon-fiber, aramid-fiber, any combination thereof, and/or other like materials; polymers such as thermoplastics (such as ABS, Fluoropolymers, Polyacetal, Polyamide; Polycarbonate, Polyethylene, Polysulfone, and/or the like), thermosets (such as Epoxy, Phenolic Resin, Polyimide, Polyurethane, Silicone, and/or the like), any combination thereof, and/or other like materials; composites and/or other like materials; metals, such as zinc, magnesium, titanium, copper, iron, steel, carbon steel, alloy steel, tool steel, stainless steel, spring steel, aluminum, any combination thereof, and/or other like materials; alloys, such as aluminum alloy, titanium alloy, magnesium alloy, copper alloy, any combination thereof, and/or other like materials; any other suitable material; and/or any combination thereof. Various implementations may be manufactured using conventional procedures as added to and improved upon through the procedures described here. Some components may be manufactured simultaneously and integrally joined with one another, while other components may be purchased pre-manufactured or manufactured separately and then assembled with the integral components. Manufacture of these components separately or simultaneously may involve extrusion, pultrusion, vacuum forming, injection molding, blow molding, resin transfer molding, casting, forging, cold rolling, milling, drilling, routing, reaming, turning, grinding, stamping, cutting, bending, welding, soldering, hardening, riveting, bolting, punching, plating, and/or the like. If any of the components are manufactured separately, they may then be coupled with one another in any manner, such as with a slot and tab, adhesive, a weld, a fastener (e.g. a bolt, a nut, a screw, a nail, a rivet, a pin, and/or the like), wiring, any combination thereof, and/or the like for example, depending on, among other considerations, the particular material forming the components. Use and Operation Referring to FIG. 4, implementations of a racket sport system and method of play for an aerial projectile game are particularly useful with rackets 17 and a wiffleball as the game ball 16. However, implementations are not limited to such uses. Rather, any description relating to such uses is for the exemplary purposes of this disclosure, and implementations may also be used with a variety of other components, as well as in a variety of other indoor or outdoor applications with similar results. In describing the operation of a racket sport system for an aerial projectile game, a method of play may be as follows. While the following description uses as an example a game played by two, two-player teams 20, 21 who use rackets 17 to serve a wiffleball as the game ball 16 in turn to each of the two truncated-cone containers 10a, 10b, any number of players or teams is contemplated, as well as different types and numbers of system components. Furthermore, the racket sport system and method of play can be an indoor or an outdoor game. Playing areas for the game may include, but not limited to: lawns, parks, beaches, dirt lots, and gymnasiums. Playing areas should provide enough room to accommodate the distance of the two targeted containers 10a, 10b. Playing areas should also provide adequate room for a served game ball 16 and movement of the players 20a, 20b, 21a, 21b around the targeted containers 10a, 10b. So for the exemplary purposes of this disclosure, the game may be played between two, two-player teams 20, 21 who use rackets 17 to serve a game ball 16 to the targeted containers 10a, 10b. The two, targeted containers 10a, 10b each has a top opening 11 and front sidewall opening 12 for game ball 16 entry. The top may be the narrowest part of the targeted containers. The targeted containers 10a, 10b are arranged facing each other at opposite sides of the playing field at a distance of twenty-five feet apart for example, though other smaller and greater distances are contemplated. One player 20a, 21a from each of the teams 20, 21 will play on one side of the playing field near a targeted container 10a whereas the remaining player 20b, 21b from each of the teams 20, 21 will play on the opposite side of the playing field near the first targeted container 10b. To determine a starting team, one player 20a, 21a from each of the teams 20, 21 will stand behind a targeted container 10a and serve the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10b. The player 20a, 21a who served the game ball 16 to land closest to the front of the opposing targeted container 10b will decide which team is on the starting team and the subsequent team. For exemplary purposes of this disclosure, the team 20 whose player is illustrated in mid-serve will be the starting team and the other team 21 will be the subsequent team. A player 20a from the starting team 20 will stand somewhere behind the front of the targeted container 10a on his/her side of the playing field and use a racket 17 to serve the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10b. The other player 20b of the starting team 20 will stand anywhere in the playing field and act as the receiver to use a racket 17 to try to assist (when desired) the game ball 16 to contact or enter the targeted container 10b. The players 20a, 20b of the starting team 20 will then swap roles whereby the receiver becomes the server and the server becomes the receiver. The other player 20b from the starting team 20 will stand somewhere behind the front of the targeted container 10b on his/her side of the playing field and use a racket 17 to serve the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10a. During the starting team's 20 turn in the round, the players 20a, 20b will attempt to score assisted and/or unassisted points. A player 21a from the subsequent team 21 will stand somewhere behind the front of the targeted container 10a on his/her side of the playing field and use a racket 17 to serve the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10b. The other player 21b of the subsequent team 21 will stand anywhere in the playing field and act as the receiver to use a racket 17 to try to assist (when desired) the game ball 16 to contact or enter the targeted container 10b. The players 21a, 21b of the subsequent team 21 will then swap roles whereby the receiver becomes the server and the server becomes the receiver. The other player 21b from the subsequent team 20 will stand somewhere behind the front of the targeted container 10b on his/her side of the playing field and use a racket 17 to serve the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10a. During the subsequent team's 21 turn in the round, the players 21a, 21b will attempt to score assisted and/or unassisted points. As players 20a, 20b, 21a, 21b from the teams 20, 21 serve/receive and receive/serve; the score is adjusted according to the amount of assisted and/or unassisted points earned. It is to be understood that variations of the scoring system for assisted and unassisted points have been contemplated. The preferred scoring system for assisted points includes a one-point play, a three-point play, or a five-point play whereas the preferred scoring system for unassisted points includes a two-point play or an immediate-victory-point play. For exemplary purposes of the scoring system, FIG. 4 will be referenced to illustrate the scoring system. If a player 20a from the starting team 20 serves the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10b and the other player 20b of the starting team 20 uses his/her racket 17 to assist the game ball 16 to contact the targeted container 10b then an assisted one point is earned. The other player 20b of the starting team 20 will then swap roles from receiver to server and will serve the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10a for another chance for the starting team 20 to score points to complete their turn in the round. If the other player 20b from the starting team 20 serves the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10a and the player 20a of the starting team 20 uses his/her racket 17 to assist the game ball 16 to enter the top opening 11 of the targeted container 10a then an assisted three points are earned. In this exemplary scenario, the starting team 20 ended their turn in the round with four points because they made a one-point play plus a three-point play to equate to the four points. If a player 21a from the subsequent team 21 serves the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10b and the other player 21b of the subsequent team 21 uses his/her racket 17 to assist the game ball 16 to enter the front sidewall opening 12 of the targeted container 10b then an assisted five points are earned. The other player 21b of the subsequent team 21 will then swap roles from receiver to server and will serve the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10a for another chance for the subsequent team 21 to score points to complete their turn in the round. If the other player 21b from the subsequent team 21 serves the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10a and the player 21a of the subsequent team 21 uses his/her racket 17 to assist the game ball 16 to enter the top opening 11 of the targeted container 10a then an assisted three points are earned. In this exemplary scenario, the subsequent team 21 ended their turn in the round with eight points because they made a five-point play plus a three-point play to equate to the eight points. If a player 20a from the starting team 20 serves the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10b and the game ball 16 contacts the targeted container 10b without the assistance from the other player 20b then an unassisted two points are earned. The other player 20b of the starting team 20 will then swap roles from receiver to server and will serve the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10a for another chance for the starting team 20 to score points to complete their turn in the round. If the other player 20b from the starting team 20 serves the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10a and the game ball 16 enters through the top opening 11 or through the front sidewall opening 12 of the targeted container 10a without the assistance from the other player 20a then an immediate-victory-point is earned. In this exemplary scenario, the starting team 20 ended the game with a win because an immediate-victory-point was earned. If a team 20, 21 earns points that add up to be greater than twenty-points then that particular team is penalized by deducting the amount of points earned during that particular play that caused the penalty. If the starting team 20, for example, had twenty points to start a round and a player 20a serves the game ball 16 to the opposing targeted container 10b and the game ball 16 contacts the targeted container 10b without the assistance from the other player 20b then an unassisted two points would be earned to total twenty-two points, which is greater than twenty-one points. The penalty in this scenario would be a reduction of two points (the amount of points earned in that particular play) from their overall twenty points to equate to eighteen points. The objective of each team 20, 21 is to score an immediate-victory-point by serving the game ball 16 to enter inside an opposing container without assistance or to be the only team to score exactly twenty-one points for example. Scoring an immediate-victory-point at any time during a game is an automatic victory for the team of the player who scored the immediate-victory-point whereas scoring exactly twenty-one points does not necessarily guarantee a victory. Even when a team is the only team to score exactly twenty-one points, the other team still has a chance for a rebuttal. If the starting team 20, for example, is the first to score exactly twenty-one points then each player 21a, 21b on the subsequent team 21 will still have another serve to try to score exactly twenty-one points or earn an immediate-victory-point, granted, that the subsequent team 21 has at least eleven points as a team. On the other hand, if the subsequent team 21 is the first to score exactly twenty-one points then the starting team 20 will not be giving a chance to tie the game since they started the game. If both teams 20, 21 score exactly twenty-one points then the team that scores the most in the overtime round(s) will be declared victorious. If a team is the only one to score exactly twenty-one points then the opposing team will be given the opportunity for a rebuttal, whereby each player of the opposing team has one opportunity to score an immediate-victory-point. If the subsequent team 21, for example, is the only team to score exactly twenty-one points then the players 20a, 20b from the starting team 20 will each have one attempt to score an immediate-victory-point to try to trump the subsequent team's 21 twenty-one points. In the event that overtime occurs, no opportunity for a rebuttal will be given after the round(s) in overtime. In places where the description above refers to particular implementations, it should be readily apparent that a number of modifications may be made without departing from the spirit thereof and that these implementations may be alternatively applied. The presently disclosed implementations are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the disclosure being indicated by the appended claims rather than the foregoing description. 1.
