Compound 4A (50.0 g, 214.34 mmol), 4-chlorobenzimidamide hydrochloride (49.1 g, 257.21 mmol), and pyridine (0.7 g, 8.57 mmol) were put into 500 ml of ethanol, and the resulting mixture was reacted for 12 hours by being stirred and refluxed. After the reaction, the mixture was cooled to normal temperature, and then poured into 1 L of a mixed solution of water and ethanol at a ratio of 1:1 while being stirred, and then the resulting mixture was sufficiently stirred. The formed solid was filtered, and then sufficiently washed with water and hexane and then dried to prepare Compound 4B (23.7 g, 30%).
