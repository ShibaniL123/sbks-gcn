Intermediate 16: 5-Chloro-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
To a suspension of 1,6-diamino-2-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 9, 500 mg, 1.21 mmol) in MeOH (6.2 mL) at 0° C. was added Et3N (0.51 mL, 3.65 mmol), followed by trifluoroacetic anhydride (0.26 mL, 1.86 mmol) dropwise via syringe. The reaction was maintained at 0° C. for 10 min then stirred at rt for 16 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and sat. aq. NaHCO3, and then the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (×2), and the combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (233 mg, 66%).
