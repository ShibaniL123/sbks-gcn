STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT The present invention was made with United States government support under Grant Nos. U01-CA15142 and U54-CA15188 awarded by the National Cancer Institute. The United States government has rights in this invention. FIELD The present application relates to biodegradable polymeric buffers and, more particularly, to the use thereof for effecting intracellular pH alteration or buffering action. BACKGROUND Delivery of nucleic acid therapies to specific disease tissue and cells in the body is challenging due to large molecular weight, negative charge, and relatively poor stability especially in biological fluids that are rich in degrading enzymes (such as DNAse and RNAse). Many technologies for nucleic acid delivery utilize cationic lipids and polymers that form electrostatic complexes (such as lipoplexes and polyplexes) with negatively-charged nucleic acid constructs. These cationic systems can be inefficient for gene therapy (with plasmid DNA) or RNA interference therapy (with siRNA) due to lack of intracellular release and stability. In addition, cationic lipids and polymers can be toxic to cells and tissues. It would be beneficial to be able to use biodegradable polymers for effecting intracellular pH alteration or buffering action to trigger drug/oligonucleotide release. SUMMARY The present application is directed to biodegradable pH altering polymers. In accordance with certain aspects, the biodegradable pH altering polymers may be used to alter the pH of a microenvironment. In accordance with other aspects, the biodegradable pH altering polymers are utilized for targeted drug and gene delivery and their spontaneous release in intracellular sites of interest. In accordance with certain aspects, the biodegradable polymer with pH altering functions is capable of protecting an encapsulated payload during delivery and also facilitating internalization, and targeted release of the drug/payload in specific organelles or regions within the cells. Targeted release may be through a variety of mechanisms. For example, targeted release may be by degradation of the polymer matrix due to micro-environmental pH changes or due to the inherent pH change caused by the polymeric nanosystem, modulated by a change in microenvironmental pH shift. The pH altering effect may be achieved by controlling the density of pH altering functional groups on the biodegradable/biocompatible polymers thereby altering the pKa of the modified polymers. The pH altering groups such as amine derivatives may be conjugated to biodegradable polymers. Furthermore, fatty amines or hydrophobic molecules containing multiple amino functionalities may be conjugated to the hydrophilic backbone to facilitate self-assembly, to form stable nanoassemblies in solution. Also, cationic polyamine derivatives conjugated onto the biocompatible polymers may be tailored to stably complex DNA/SiRNA and/or drugs ensuring their encapsulation into the polymeric nanosystems without causing apparent toxicity. One of the advantages of such a system relates to the ability to control the composition of the polymer functionality to have the right balance of charge for encapsulating DNA/SiRNA and at the same time maintaining a net neutral or negative charge on the overall polymeric system, thereby rendering no or minimal toxicity to the non-target organs and tissue on in vivo administration. For this purpose, varying molecular weights of the biodegradable/biocompatible polymers, such as 10, 20, 40 kDa hyaluronic acid (HA) or dextrans with varying chain lengths, may be used to optimize the nanoassemblies. In accordance with certain aspects, the molecular weight of the HA derivatives may be in the range of about 10-100 kDa, more particularly about 10-40 kDa. In accordance with particularly useful aspects, the charge on the polymer may fall in the range from about −40 to +10 mV. Furthermore, the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance on the polymer, degree of functionalization and the number of amino groups may be controlled by altering the reaction conditions as well as by using various fatty amine derivatives with varying carbon chain lengths. Examples of suitable derivatives include, but are not limited to, butyl amine (C=4), hexyl amine (C=6), octyl amine (C=8) and stearyl amine (C=18). Derivatives with multiple nitrogen groups such as 1,3 diamine propane (C=10, N=4), 1,4 diamino butane (C=4, N=2), 1,6 diamino hexane (C=6, N=2) 1,2 aminoethyl piperazine (C=6, N=3) and spermine (C=10, N=4) may be used to arrive at the right combination of charge for SiRNA/drug encapsulation and stable self-assembly for formation of nanoparticles. In some cases, protected fatty acids such as BOC-1,4) diamino butane or BOC-1,3 diamino propane can be used to conjugate with a biodegradable polymer (e.g., hyaluronic acid) followed by deprotection to yield the free primary amine containing derivatives. These derivatives may further be modified via the free primary amine groups to form derivatives with variable carbon chain lengths containing nitrogen atoms in the backbone. In other cases, azide-alkyne click chemical ligations may be used to create HA based functional macrostructure with precise control on the density of lipid tails and/or charge density of polyamines. The present application also describes the pH altering functions of the nanosystems in vitro on incubation with cells and their effect on the release of the SiRNA/drug in the target sites within the cells. In one aspect, the present application provides a method of modifying the pH of a microenvironment in need of pH modification by introducing into the microenvironment a polymeric buffer, wherein the polymeric buffer comprises a biodegradable pH altering polymer or a biodegradable polymer conjugated with pH altering groups. In accordance with certain aspects, the pH altering groups may include at least one nitrogen-containing group and in certain cases, at least one amine group. The polymeric buffer may include primary, secondary or tertiary nitrogen containing molecules. The polymeric buffer may have a pKa of at least 3.0, more particularly from about 4.0-6.0, and, still more particularly, from about 4.5-5.0. In another aspect of the present application, the pH altering groups on the polymeric buffer may be derivatives of butyl amine, hexyl amine, octyl amine, stearyl amine, 1,3 diamine propane, 1,4 diamino butane, 1,6 diamino hexane, 1,2 aminoethyl piperazine or spermine. The biodegradable polymer in accordance with particular embodiments may be water soluble. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, hyaluronic acid (HA) or dextran. The % modification of the biodegradable polymer may be at least 5%, more particularly from about 10% to 80%, and in certain aspects, from about 10% to 40%. Specific examples of polymeric buffers include, but are not limited to, HA-butylamine, HA-hexylamine, HA-octylamine, HA-1-amino decane, HA-stearylamine, HA-oleyl amine, HA-1,6 diaminohexane, HA-1,8 diaminooctane, HA-choline, HA-polyethyleneimine and HA-spermine. In accordance with another embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions are provided comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier or diluent and at least one polymeric buffer, wherein the polymeric buffer comprises a biodegradable pH altering polymer or a biodegradable polymer conjugated with pH altering groups. The pharmaceutical composition may include a therapeutic agent. In accordance with certain aspects, the therapeutic agent may be a chemotherapeutic agent. In particular embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent is doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or tamoxifen. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is a functional nucleic acid or a functional nucleic acid construct. In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid is an siRNA molecule, an aptamer, or a ribozyme. The present application is also directed to a method of treating a subject having a tumor.

Methods of Preparation: Pharmaceutical Compositions This invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of the polymeric buffers as described herein or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The phrase “pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier” as used herein means a pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject pharmaceutical agent from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as butylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer solutions; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations. As set out above, certain embodiments of the present pharmaceutical agents may be provided in the form of pharmaceutically-acceptable salts. The term “pharmaceutically-acceptable salt”, in this respect, refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or by separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, napthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, and laurylsulphonate salts and the like.

In other cases, the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically-acceptable salts with pharmaceutically-acceptable bases. The term “pharmaceutically-acceptable salts” in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can likewise be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically-acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically-acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine and the like.

Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium stearate, and polyethylene oxide-polybutylene oxide copolymer as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions. Formulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient, which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of 100%, this amount will range from about 1% to about 99% of active ingredient, preferably from about 5% to about 70%, most preferably from about 10% to about 30%. Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste. In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like), the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; humectants, such as glycerol; disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, sodium carbonate, and sodium starch glycolate; solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate, and polyethylene oxide-polybutylene oxide copolymer; absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; lubricants, such a talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using a binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxybutylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxybutylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions, which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples are embedding compositions, which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more of the above-described excipients. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds of the invention include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, butylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Additionally, cyclodextrins, e.g., hydroxybutyl-.beta.-cyclodextrin, may be used to solubilize compounds. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents. Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active pharmaceutical agents of the invention. Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be apbutriate. Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or butellants which may be required. The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a compound of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary butellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and butane. Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the present invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving, or dispersing the pharmaceutical agents in the buter medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the pharmaceutical agents of the invention across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled, by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. One strategy for depot injections includes the use of polyethylene oxide-polybutylene oxide copolymers wherein the vehicle is fluid at room temperature and solidifies at body temperature. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly (orthoesters) and poly (anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions, which are compatible with body tissue. When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1% to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5% to 90%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, the compound of the present invention may be administered concurrently with another agent for treating the same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). The compounds of the invention may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, topically, orally, or by other acceptable means. The compounds may be used to treat conditions in mammals (i.e., humans, livestock, and domestic animals), birds, lizards, and any other organism, which can tolerate the compounds. The compositions can be introduced to target areas in need of pH alteration for a given microenvironment. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.

EXAMPLES Synthesis of Hyaluronic Acid Derivatives Scheme 1 (See FIG. 1): Sodium hyaluronate (100 mg, 0.25 mmol, mw 10 kDa/20 kDa/40 kDa) was dissolved in water at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. To this solution was added a 30 fold excess of an amine or hydrazide (pKa 3-8; 7.5 mmol) e.g., ethylenediamine, adipic hydrazide. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 6.8 with 0.1 M NaOH/0.1M HCl. 1ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (EDC) (192 mg, 1 mmol) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (135 mg, 1 mmol) was dissolved in DMSO/water (1:1). After mixing, the pH of the reaction was maintained at 6.8 by the addition of 0.1 M NaOH and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight. The pH was subsequently adjusted to 7.0 with 0.1 M NaOH and the derivatized hyaluronic acid was dialyzed exhaustively, to yield the purified product. The modified HA was precipitated by addition of 3 vol equivalents of ethanol. The precipitate was redissolved in water at a concentration of 5 mg/ml and the purified product was freeze-dried and kept at 4 degree C. The yield of the product was typically 80%. Scheme 2: To an aqueous solution of sodium hyaluronate (10 kDa/20 kDa/40 kDa, 3 mg/ml) was added a 30 fold molar excess of an amine (7.5 mmol), e.g., 1-4 diamino butane or 1-6 diamino hexane. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 7.5 with 0.1 M NaOH/0.1 M HCl. EDC (192 mg, 1 mmol) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS) (217 mg, 1 mmol) were dissolved in water (1 ml). After mixing, the pH of the reaction was maintained at 7.5 by the addition of 0.1 M NaOH and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight. The HA derivatives were purified and stored at 4 degree C. Specific examples are provided in Scheme 2: A (see FIG. 2); Scheme 2: B (see FIG. 3); Scheme 3: A (see FIG. 4); and Scheme 3: B (see FIG. 5). Scheme 4: Incorporating Polyamines Containing Secondary or Tertiary Amines with Higher Degree of Modifications. For gene delivery charge interaction plays a key role and by altering the reaction conditions one can improve the percentage modification of spermine on the surface of HA. To address this, the polymer can be reacted with polyamines in THF in the presence of DCC/NHS with the assumption that the modifications can be increased without additional cross linkings and that would further overcome the negative charges on the HA surface and thereby enhance the encapsulation, cell entry and endosome escape to ultimately show improved silencing. Scheme 4.2: Modifying HA with PEI With the intention of increasing the encapsulation/endosome release and activity, the HA backbone was modified with a highly cationic polyamine, poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) under mild reaction conditions without generating any crosslinking PEI has multiple amine groups that seem to efficiently condense with siRNA and form a core within self-assembled particles. On the complexation with siRNA, the zeta potential was inverted from positive for the PEI to negative for the siRNA/HA-PEI, reflecting the core-shell structure of the HA-PEI/siRNA complex with HA backbone exposed in the shell and the PEI grafted chains complexed with RNA molecules in the core. Hyaluronic acid (HA) polymer was chemically modified with polyethyleneimine (PEI) by using a coupling agent, 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). In brief, sodium hyaluronate (MW 20 kDa, 100 mg, 5 μmole, Lifecore Biomedical, Chaska, Minn.) was dissolved in 5 ml of dry formamide in a glass scintillation vial by warming up the reaction vial up to 50° C. After obtaining a clear solution the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and then ˜3.3 mg of the PEI (Polysciences Inc, Warrington, Pa., MW 10 kDa, ˜0.33 μmole) was added to the solution. Then, EDC (10 μmole, Sigma Aldrich, Mo.) was added into the reaction mixture and stirred for 12 hours using a magnetic stirrer. The resulting reaction mixture was added into a large excess of EtOH (200 ml) to precipitate the polymer. The EtOH washing step was repeated thrice to purify the polymer. Subsequently, the HA-PEI precipitate was further dialyzed using cellulose dialysis membranes (MW cut off ˜12-14 kDa) against deionized water for 96 hours. The purified product was then lyophilized and stored (yield: 90 mg, ˜86%, off-white fibrous product). A 3 mg portion of the lyophilized product was dissolved in 600 μl of D2O and characterized by 400 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Varian Inc., CA). FIG. 5 illustrates a proposed structure of PEI-modified HA following self-assembly with siRNA. By designing the complexes to include the HA molecules in the outer shell, one can explore the targeting properties of HA. Moreover, the negative charges present on the surface of HA can effectively shield the positive charges of the RNA/PEI complex, which leads to a decrease in toxicity that is normally associated with positively charged molecules. FIG. 7 shows the 1H-NMR spectra of the native HA polymer, native PEI, HA and PEI mixture and the purified HA-PEI conjugate. Scheme 6: ‘Clickable’ HA Based Functional Macrostructures for Stable Self-Assembly and Encapsulation of Diverse Drug Payloads. Materials: Sodium hyaluronate (molecular weight 40K, 20K and 10K) was obtained from Lifecore Biomedical. Copper sulfate, bromoethane, bromobutane, bromohexane, bromooctane, bromodecane, bromododecane, bromooctadecane, dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and hexane were purchased from Fisher Scientific. N-Ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylamineproyl)-carbodiimide (EDAC) was obtained from Bachem. N-hydroxysulfosccinimide (sulfo-NHS), sodium L-ascorbate, sodium azide, and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) was purchased from AK Scientific. FIG. 8 shows a scheme for “clickable” HA based functional macrostructures. Methods: Synthesis of “Clickable” HA For “click” conjugation of hyaluronic acid (HA), an o-pentynyl moiety was attached as shown in Scheme 1. HA (Mw=20 kDa, 1 g, 50 μmol) was dissolved in dry formamide solution (40 mL) at 50° C. after bubbling N2 into the solution for 15 min. After mixing to form a clear solution, 1.5 M MeLi (18.5 mL, 1.5 eq.) was added. The mixture was cooled in an ice-bath and 5-chloro-1-pentyne (0.6 mL, 0.3 eq.) was added slowly. Stirring was continued for 24 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The product was isolated by precipitating in 350 mL of ethanol, washing two times with 50 mL of ethanol, and purifying by dialysis against demineralized water and freeze drying (1.25 g, white solid) with degree of substitution (DS) ˜10%. Degree of substitution of 10 was determined by means of 1H-NMR. In accordance with another method to form the alkynyl-HA precursor, propargylamine, an alkynyl moiety, was attached as using EDC/sulfo NHS coupling. Briefly, HA (Mw=20 kDa, 1 g, 6.17 mol) was dissolved in 10 ml water. To it 5 m. of propargylamine was added and stirred. To it 2 molar excess of EDC/sulfo NHS was first dissolved in 5 ml of water and reacted for 30 min to 1 h. Subsequently, EDC/NHS mixture was added (1 ml each time drop-wise addition) to the vial containing HA and propargylamine. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight followed by purification using TFF system and lyophilization. The degree of substitution was determined by means of 1H-NMR spectroscopy. “Click” Synthesis of Lipid-Modified HA Experiments were carried out with alkynyl HA and alkyl bromides (CnH2n+1, n=2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18). In a representative experiment, HA (DS 10%, 250 mg) was dissolved in water (25 ml) and added to a round-bottom flask containing bromoethane (2 g, 18.35 mmol), sodium azide (2.38 g, 36.71 mmol), and copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (8 mg, 0.032 mmol), sodium ascorbate (19 mg, 0.129 mmol). After stirring the mixture at room temperature for 24 h, product was purified by dialysis against demineralized water and freeze-dried (180 mg, pale green solid). “Click” Synthesis of Thiol-Modified HA Sodium azide (NaN3, 0.5 g, 3.17 mmol) was added to a solution of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane (0.2 g, 3.17 mmol) in 15 mL of DMF at room temperature. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for overnight. The reaction mixture was partitioned between ether and water, and the organic layer was washed with water, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to give 1-azido-3-chloropropane (0.3 g, 92%) as a colorless viscous liquid. Solution of cysteamine (0.19 g, 2.5 mmol) in THF (15 ml) was added to a stirred suspension of 1-azido-3-chloropropane (0.3 g, 2.5 mmol) in THF (15 ml). After stirring under nitrogen for 3 days at room temperature, the solvent was evaporated in vacuo and the yellow solid residue was washed with THF/hexane (1/5). This product was dissolved in 25 ml water and added to a round-bottom flask containing alkynyl HA (DS 10%, 250 mg), copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (8 mg, 0.032 mmol), sodium ascorbate (19 mg, 0.129 mmol). After stirring the mixture at rt for 24 h, product was purified by dialysis against demineralized water and freeze-dried. “Click” Synthesis of PEG-Modified HA Methoxypolyethylene glycol azide 2000 (250 mg) and alkynyl HA (DS 10%, 250 mg) were dissolved in 25 ml water in a round-bottom flask. Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (8 mg, 0.032 mmol) and sodium ascorbate (19 mg, 0.129 mmol) were added and stirred the mixture at rt for 24 h. The product was purified by dialysis against demineralized water and freeze-dried. Chemical Synthesis of PEG-Modified HA HA (MW 20 kDa, 200 mg, 10 μmole) was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water. HOBt (20 μmol, 3 mg) solubilized in 100 μL of methanol was added drop-wise into the HA solution. EDC (20 μmol, 4 mg) and sulfo-NHS (20 μmol, 4 mg) were mixed together in 5 mL deionized water and allowed to stand for 15 min. The resultant EDC/sulfo-NHS solution was added drop-wise into the HA and HOBt solution for about 1 h. After stirring for 4 h, mPEG-NH2 solution (2 kDa, 20 mg, 10 μmol) in deionized water (5 mL) was slowly added to the stirred solution. This mixture was stirred for 1 day at room temperature. The resulting solution was then loaded into a dialysis bag (MWCO; 6-8 kDa) and dialyzed against the methanol and DDW mixture (1:1, v/v) for 2 days. After freeze-drying, a yellowish white powder was obtained as a product. The introduction ratio of PEG to HA was measured by 1H-NMR analysis. HA and HA-PEG were dissolved in D2O for analysis by 1H-NMR (400 MHz).

Table 2 shows the encapsulation of drugs in different HA derivatives with varying lipid modification. Attempted weight by loading and encapsulation efficiency resulted in percent by weight final loading. 8) In Vitro Cell Up Take Studies of Free Doxorubicin (DOX) and DOX Loaded HA Polymers: In order to determine the pH altering effects of the hyaluronic acid-lipid modified polymers and cellular trafficking of drugs, a model fluorescent drug, doxorubicin, was encapsulated into the unmodified and modified HA polymers and tested on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Method: The MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in 6 well culture plates and incubated with equimolar concentration (20 μM) of either the free doxorubicin (DOX), DOX encapsulated in the unmodified hyaluronic acid polymer (HA, 10 kDa, pKa˜3) or DOX encapsulated in one of the lipid-modified HA derivative, HA-1,8 diamino octane (HA-ODA, pKa˜5). After 1 h of incubation, the cells were washed thrice with PBS and the uptake of DOX in the cells was observed using a fluorescence microscope. The results are shown in FIG. 20, which shows fluorescence microscopy of free doxorubicin (DOX), DOX loaded unmodified hyaluronic acid (HA-DOX, PKa˜3) polymer and DOX loaded HA polymer modified with 1,8 diamino octane (HA-ODA-DOX, PKa˜5); magnification used, 40×. From the figure it can be seen that after 1 h incubation of free DOX or DOX loaded unmodified and lipid modified HA derivative, there was significantly higher uptake of DOX in the nucleus of the cells treated with HA-ODA-DOX formulation, however the uptake of DOX in the cells treated with either free DOX or unmodified HA-DOX formulation were not significantly different, wherein the uptake of DOX in the cells is found to be higher in the cytoplasm and endosomal/lysosomal compartments and much lower in the nucleus. This effect may be in part due to the efficient uptake of the drug within 1 h into the cells by both the unmodified polymer and the lipid-modified derivative but the higher pKa value of the HA-ODA derivative may have facilitated the endosomal/lysosomal escape of the encapsulated DOX and its efficient translocation into the nucleus. 9) Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Drug Loaded HA Nanoparticles on Ovarian Cancer Cells: TABLE 3 IC50 of Nanoparticles vs. IC50 of Free Drug. The IC50 of the encapsulated drug and the free drug were determined by cytotoxicity assays using SKOV3 cells at a 48 hour timepoint. Free drug Encapsulated drug Drug IC50 (μM) IC50 (μM) Doxorubicin 5.784 1.094 Idarubicin 3.82 4.2 Topotecan 0.22 0.73 Etoposide 4.58 3.37 Camptothecin 0.82 0.29 Paclitaxel 0.0101 0.00789 The general trend seen was that IC50 is improved in the case of the encapsulated drug. 10) Encapsulation of Oligonucleotides/siRNA in HA Based Nanoparticles: FIGS. 21A-C provide a putative representation of the formation of siRNA-loaded HA-nanosystem. The negatively charged siRNA is proposed to complex with the cationic polymer PEI forming the core, with the negatively charged HA forming the corona (A). The proposed structure is supported by the size and charge data from light scattering and transmission electron microscopy (B). Also 100% siRNA loading in HA nanosystem was observed by gel retardation assay that could be released in presence of polyacrylic acid (PAA). Determination of siRNA Entrapment Efficiency and Release Using Gel Retardation Assays To confirm if the particles encapsulated siRNA, an agarose gel electrophoresis was utilized (FIG. 22). The polymer/siRNA complex was prepared by mixing HA derivative with siRNA and incubating at RT for 30 min. These complexes were run on gel and determined the mean density of siRNA bands. More specifically, FIG. 22 provides electrophoretic retardation analysis of siRNA binding by HA-PEI derivatives at different mass ratios (90:1, 54:1, 45:1). The release of intact siRNA by polyacrylic acid was shown in each case. The binding percentage was calculated based on the relative intensity of free siRNA band in each well with respect to wells with free siRNA (in the absence of any polymers). When there was complete complexation, the free band completely disappeared. In cases when there was complete complexation and there was no free band on gel, an alternate method was utilized to confirm that there was siRNA encapsulation. Complexes were treated with a polyanionic poly acrylic acid and run on gel. This anionic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) would compete with the anionic polymer and release the siRNA which then appears as a free band in the gel. The ability of complexes to release siRNA after a challenge with the competing polyanionic PAA was determined by measuring the mean density of siRNA band that appear after the treatment. When particles were treated with poly acrylic acid, complexes with and without PAA were run on gel to confirm that the siRNA was intact when it was complexed. 11) In Vitro siRNA Delivery TABLE 4 The siRNA delivery efficiency into tumor cells was tested using various HA-lipid formulations as below: Self siRNA Activ- Size Charge assem- encap- ity in (nm) + (mV) + HA Derivative bly sulation cells siRNA siRNA HA- butylamine − − − — — in water (C4) HA- hexylamine + − − 1000 ± 1 −20 in water (C6) HA- octylamine + − − 200 ± 0.3 −20 in water (C8) HA-stearylamine + − − 190 ± 0.3 −15 in water (C18) HA- 1,6 + + − 320 ± 0.5 −8 diaminohexane in water HA-1,8 diaminooc- + + − 142 ± 0.2 −10 tane in water HA- choline in + + − 175 ± 0.4 0 water HA-spermine in + + + 190 ± 0.3 +16.5 water HA-polyeth- + + + 50 ± 0.9 −6.5 yleneimine (PEI) in PBS HA-PEI/HA-PEG + + + 85 ± 0.9 −5.5 in PBS HA-PEI/HA-PEG/ + + + 90 ± 1.2 −8.5 HA-SH in PBS 11) Preliminary Evaluations of Delivery in Cells Expressing CD44 Receptors The derivatives that formed good size nanoparticles and demonstrated good siRNA encapsulation were taken forward to evaluate the activity in cells. The prepared Cy3siRNA/polymer complexes were reverse transfected into cells expressing CD44 (MDA MB-468) at 50 nM siRNA concentration and incubated for 48 hours and examined under the confocal microscope to see if there was any cell uptake. FIG. 23 provides the confocal microscopy images of MDAMB-468 cells after treatment with HA PEI/Cy3siRNA at 50 nM for 12 h. The internalization of siRNA could be clearly seen in the cells (red signal). For competitive inhibition studies to determine the cellular uptake of HA nanoparticles, the cells were pre-treated with 2 ml of serum free culture medium containing HA at 10 mg/ml. After the treatment, the Cy3 labeled HA nanoparticles were added to the MDA-MB 468 cells followed by incubation of 24 hours. The cells were washed twice with PBS and examined under microscope. A large reduction in cell uptake was noticed in the cells that were pre-treated with excess HA, suggesting that these particles enter into cells by receptor mediated pathway. No activity was detected in cells that do not express CD44, again confirming that this is a receptor mediated pathway. FIG. 24 shows the results of the competitive inhibition study, where the cells were incubated with HA-PEI/Cy3-labeled siRNA in the presence and absence of excess free HA. A similar result was observed with HA-choline derivatives. FIGS. 25A-B show cellular uptake of HA-choline/cy3 siRNA in MDA-MB 468 cells. For competitive inhibition study, the cells were incubated with HA-choline in the presence and absence of excess free HA 12) Effects of Chloroquine in Enhancing Endosomal Escape Cell uptake studies showed that the hydrophobically modified derivatives of HA, despite their resultant negative charge, entered into cells but gave no cellular activity. It has been demonstrated previously that the cell entry was receptor mediated and it is independent of the charge on the surface. The presence of positive charge was most likely to help the complex to get out of the endosome. All the derivatives described herein, except the HA-SP and HA-PEI, demonstrated cell uptake but no gene down regulation. In order to confirm that these complexes are stuck in the endosome without being released, the transfection was done in the presence of a weak base, chloroquine. It has been reported that this small molecule helps to disrupt the endosome in addition to inhibit the endosome-lysosome fusion. Both of these activities together appear to help the complex to be released from the endosome. Treatment of cells with HA-SP/siRNA (at 90:1 ratio) and chloroquine demonstrated activity in cells whereas the same complex without chloroquine failed to show cell activity. The results are provided in FIG. 26, which shows HA-SP/PLK1 siRNA mediated PLK1 gene silencing in the presence of chloroquine in MDA MB 468 cells at 90:1 ratio. Cells treated with PLK1 siRNA formulated HA-SP or CTL siRNA formulated HA-SP in the presence or absence of chloroquine for 48 hours. The PLK1 gene expression was measured by qPCR. Data represented as a mean±SD (n=3). *p=0.01 compared to PBS and CTL treatment groups. 13) In Vitro Gene Silencing Studies After confirming the cell uptake, the ability of this HA-spermine complex to deliver a functional siRNA was evaluated using PLK1 targeted siRNA to inhibit PLK1 gene expression in CD44 expressing cells. Cells were transfected with different HA derivative/siRNA and at different concentrations (50-300 nM). After 48 hours, the RNA was extracted from the cells and subjected to quantitative PCR to determine the mRNA knockdown. Although all the fatty acid modified HAs have demonstrated cell uptake, most of them failed to down regulate the PLK1 gene expression. The spermine derivatized HA demonstrated about 40% activity at 100, 200 and 300 nM while the control siRNA/HA-SP in the same study did not produce any activity (FIGS. 27A-B). It's interesting to note that the HA-SP demonstrated activity only at the mass ratio of 54:1 (polymer:siRNA). It failed to demonstrate activity at a ratio of 18:1 (polymer:siRNA) or higher. It's also worth noting that the zeta potential of the 55:1 ratio complex was around +16.5 mV whereas the other one was around +5-6 mV or close to neutral. More specifically, FIG. 27 shows HA-SP/PLK1 siRNA mediated PLK1 gene silencing in MDAMB468 cells. Cells treated with PLK1 siRNA formulated HA-SP or CTL siRNA formulated HA-SP for 48 hours at mass ratios (1)54:1(A) or (2) 45: or 27:1. (B). The PLK1 gene expression was measured by qPCR. Data represented as mean±SD(n=3). *p=0.01 compared to PBS and CTL treatment groups. Since it's believed that these complexes enter into the cells by receptor mediated pathways, the resultant positive charge on the surface probably helps the complex to get out of the endosome. In addition to HA-SP, the PEI modified HA also demonstrated activity in the CD44 expressing MDA-MB 468 cells. Again, at the ratio of 54:1, the complex demonstrated good activity with good dose response. This complex also failed to show activity at 27:1, 18:1 or 9:1 ratios. In contrast to the HA-SP/siRNA complex, the HA-PEI became completely negative in charge after encapsulating the siRNA. Nonetheless, the complex showed good activity in cells, which suggests the core/shell structure of the HA-PEI/siRNA complex with HA backbone exposed in the shell and the PEI grafted chains complexed with siRNA molecules in the core. FIGS. 28A-B show the results for HA-PEI/PLK1 siRNA mediated PLK1 gene silencing in MDAMB468 cells. Cells treated with PLK1 siRNA formulated HA-PEI or CTL siRNA formulated HA-PEI for 48 hours at mass ratios (1) 54:1 or (2) 45:1 or 27:1. The PLK1 gene expression was measured by qPCR. Data represented as mean±SD(n=3). *p=0.01 and **p=0.02 compared to PBS and CTL treatment groups. 14) PLK1 siRNA Knockdown in A549/A549DDP NSCL Cancer Cells Non-small cell lung cancer cells were transfected with PLK1 siRNA encapsulated in HA-PEI or HA-PLL nanosystems at a concentration of 100 and 300 nM. Cells were harvested and RNA was extracted after 48 hrs. qPCR was run to determine the target gene knockdown. As seen in FIG. 29, HA-PEI and HA-PLL both could stably encapsulate PLK1 siRNA and exhibit marked downregulation of target gene in both sensitive and resistant lung cancer cells. 15) Live Animal Imaging and Tumor Targeting of HA Based Nanosystems. CD44 expressing A549 and A549DDP sensitive and resistant NSCL cancer bearing mice were imaged with indocyanine green (ICG) dye loaded HA nanosystem at the time shown. Time dependent accumulation of the dye loaded HA nanosystems in the tumor is clearly seen in FIG. 30. 16) Tissue Distribution of Survivin siRNA in A549DDP Tumor Bearing Mice. Mice were injected thrice with HA-PEI/PEG/survivin at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg and subsequently the tissues were collected at 1, 6 and 24 hours after the last dose. PCR method was utilized to quantitate the siRNA in tissue samples. Results are provided in FIG. 31. 17) In Vivo Gene Silencing: Survivin Gene Knockdown in A549DDP Tumors at Varying Time Points. Tumor bearing mice were intravenously injected with survivin siRNA encapsulated in HA-PEI/HA-PEG nanoparticles at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg for 3 days. At 24, 72 and 120 hours after injection, tumors were harvested and RNA was extracted. qPCR was run to determine the target KD. As shown in FIG. 32, the target gene knock down up to 5 days was observed. 18) Combination siRNA/Drug Efficacy and Safety FIGS. 33A-C provide results relating to efficacy of a combination siRNA and Cisplatin loaded in HA Nanosystems. A) HA-ODA/Cisplatin or its combination with bcl2 siRNA in HA-PEI nanosystem is shown; B) HA-ODA/Cisplatin or its combination with survivin siRNA in HA-PEI Nanosystem is shown; and C) The effect of HA-ODA/Cisplatin nanosystem or its combination with both bcl2 and survivin loaded in HA-PEI nanosystem is shown. From the results, it is clear that the combination treatment exhibits the best synergism in terms of tumor suppression. In Vivo Safety Evaluation of HA Nanosystems. FIG. 34 shows the % body weight change in mice that had single or combination treatment during the study period. It is evident from the results that at the administered dose of HA nanoparticles, no apparent toxicity or weight loss was observed indicating the safety of the delivery systems in vivo. 1.
