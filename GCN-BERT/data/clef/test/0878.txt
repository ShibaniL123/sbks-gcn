Step 47-5, preparation of tert-butyl N-(1-{6-[3-cyano-2-(methoxymethoxy)phenyl]-3-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-1,8-naphthyridin-4-yl}piperidin-4-yl)carbamate: to a mixture of tert-butyl N-(1-{3-chloro-6-[3-cyano-2-(methoxymethoxy)phenyl]-1,8-naphthyridin-4-yl}piperidin-4-yl)carbamate (106.8 mg, 0.20 mmol), 3,5-difluorophenylboronic acid (64.4 mg, 0.41 mmol), Pd[t-Bu2P(4-NMe2C6H4)]2Cl2) (14.4 mg, 0.02 mmol), and K2CO3 (84.6 mg, 0.61 mmol) in a sealed tube was added dioxane (3 mL) and water (0.3 mL).). The mixture was bubbled with N2 (g) for 10 min and then heated at 100Â° C. for 50 min. The mixture was concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography to give the title compound (104.8 mg, 0.17 mmol, 85.3% yield) as a brown gum. MS (M+1)+=602.6.
