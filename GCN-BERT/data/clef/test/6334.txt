DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In order to understand the technical features, purpose and the effect of the present invention more clearly, the preferred specific embodiments of the present invention will be described referring to the drawings. Referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, an electronic cigarette case comprises a cigarette case body 1. One end of the cigarette case body 1 defines an opening, and a section of the opening is a slope. A case cover 6 is mounted at one side of the opening of the cigarette case body 1, and is rotationally connected to the cigarette case body 1 by a connection part 7. The cigarette case 6 includes another slope matching the opening of the cigarette case body 1. The connection part 7 can be a hinge, a connection part with an independent folder, and so on, and can also be integrally formed with the cigarette case body 1 and the case cover 6, as shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. The cigarette case body 1 receives an accommodation structure 2, and the accommodation structure 2 includes a protrusion part 8 extending out of the cigarette case body 1. A first accommodation region configured for holding at least one electronic cigarette 100 (wherein, the first accommodation is not labeled in the drawings; the first accommodation region is configured for holding at least one electronic cigarette 100, and the number of the held electronic cigarette 100 can be determined according to the size of the cigarette case) is formed in the accommodation structure 2. A second accommodation region (not labeled in the drawings) is formed between an outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 and an inner surface of the cigarette case body 1. Referring to FIG. 5, the accommodation structure 2 includes a first combining part 21, a second combining part 22, and a holding cavity 23. The first accommodation region is formed by the holding cavity 23. The holding cavity 23 is formed between the first combining part 21 and the second combining part 22, and the shape of the holding cavity 23 matches the external shape of the electronic cigarette 100. Referring to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the accommodation structure 2 is inserted into and placed in the cigarette case body 1, and a seal cartridge 4 is embedded in the second combining part 22. A through hole (not labeled in the drawings) is defined in a bottom of the cigarette case body 1 that is far away from the opening, and a lock piece 5 passes through the through hole and is connected to the second combining part 22. Thus, the accommodation structure 2 is mounted inside the cigarette case 1 detachably by the lock piece 5. The lock piece 5 can be a screw or a bolt. Referring to FIG. 1, a gap space 3 with a width ranged from 0.5-5 millimeters is formed between the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 and the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1, and thereby forms the second accommodation region. Referring to FIGS. 2-4, the gap space 3 is configured to receive a paper document 200, which is generally an electronic cigarette operating instruction, an electronic cigarette certification, and so on. The gap space 3 includes various forms: When a first gap is formed between the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 and one corresponding side wall of the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1, and the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 is in contact with the other corresponding side walls of the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1, the gap space 3 with a bar-shaped cross-section is formed by the first gap. When a second gap is formed between the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 and two adjacent corresponding side walls of the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1, and the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 is in contact with the other corresponding side walls of the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1, the gap space 3 with an L-shaped cross-section is formed by the second gap. When a third gap is formed between the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 and three adjacent corresponding side walls of the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1, and the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 is in contact with the other corresponding side walls of the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1, the gap space 3 with a U-shaped cross-section is formed by the third gap. When the accommodation structure 2 is positioned in a middle portion of the cigarette case body 1, and none of the side walls of the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1 is in contact with the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2, the gap space 3 with an end-to-end closing-shaped cross-section is formed by a fourth gap between the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 and the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1. When the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 and the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1 are both camber curved surfaces, and a fifth gap is formed between the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 and a corresponding part of the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1, the gap space 3 with a camber-shaped cross-section is formed by the fifth gap. Preferably, the gap space 3 is formed by the first gap between the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 and one corresponding side wall of the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1, and the cross-section of the gap space 3 is bar-shaped. The gap space 3 can be formed at the same side of the cigarette case body 1 as the connection part 7, and can also be formed at a side of the cigarette case body 1 that is opposite to the connection part 7. Furthermore, the gap space 3 extends to a bottom of the cigarette case body 1 along a direction for inserting the electronic cigarette 100 into the cigarette case body 1. Referring to FIG. 1, the first combining part 21 of the accommodation structure 2 includes a protrusion part 8 extending out of the cigarette case body 1, and the protrusion part is generally U-shaped. Referring to FIG. 5, the protrusion part 8 includes a first protrusion surface 81, a second protrusion surface 82, and a third protrusion surface 83. A side of the first protrusion surface 81 that is opposite to the connection part 7 protrudes from the cigarette case body 1. The second protrusion surface 82 and the third protrusion surface 83 are respectively formed at ends of two side walls of the protrusion part 8 that are both adjacent to the first protrusion surface 81. Referring to FIG. 6, an outer side of the second protrusion surface 82 and/or an outer side of the third protrusion surface 83 can define at least one groove 810, an inner wall of the case cover 6 corresponding to the second protrusion surface 82 and/or the third protrusion surface 83 can form at least one bulge 620 corresponding to the groove 810, and the groove 810 is buckled with the bulge 620. Referring to FIG. 7, the outer side of the second protrusion surface 82 and/or the third protrusion surface 83 can also define at least one bulge 820, the inner wall of the case cover 6 corresponding to the second protrusion surface 82 and/or the third protrusion surface 83 can also form at least one groove 610 corresponding to the bulge 820, and the bulge 820 is buckled with the groove 610. In addition, the case cover 6 can be connected to the accommodation structure 2 by magnetic attraction or other kinds of connections, so as to connect the case cover 6 with the cigarette case body 1. The case cover 6 can also be directly connected to the cigarette case body 1 by magnetic attraction or other kinds of connections. In the present invention, by setting the second accommodation region configured for receiving the electronic cigarette operating instruction in the electronic cigarette case, that is, the gap space 3 formed between the outer surface of the accommodation structure 2 and the inner surface of the cigarette case body 1, the instruction can be taken out and inserted into the electronic cigarette case easily, and it is convenient for users to use. Furthermore, in assembly, the instruction can be directly inserted into the electronic cigarette case, which brings great convenience for the production and improves the production efficiency.
