In backlight computer displays or other systems, optical films are commonly used to direct light. For example, in backlight displays, brightness enhancement films use prismatic structures to direct light along the viewing axis (i.e., an axis normal to the display, or "on axis"). This enhances the brightness of the light viewed by the user of the display and allows the system to use less power to create a desired level of on axis illumination. Films for turning light can also be used in a wide range of other optical designs, such as for projection displays, traffic signals, and illuminated signs. Backlight displays and other systems use layers of films stacked and arranged so that the prismatic surfaces thereof are perpendicular to one another and are sandwiched between other optical films known as diffusers. Diffusers have highly irregular surfaces. The use of current commercial brightness enhancement films causes a sharp cut-off in brightness between about 40 and 50 degrees off-axis. At angles beyond this cutoff there are side-lobes in the angular brightness distribution. These side-lobes can result in a waste of energy because they are outside the desired viewing angle specifications of many liquid crystal display (LCD) devices. The side-lobes are also undesirable in security applications since they allow light to reach unintended viewers. Thus, there is a continuing and demonstrated need in the prior art for brightness enhancement films which suppress sidelobes in the angular distribution of brightness. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In a first embodiment, the invention features a structural shape for the surface of an optical substrate such that the brightness of diffuse light departing from the surface of the optical substrate at certain off axis aligles is reduced, at the expense ors small reduction in peak brightness measured near the viewing axis. The net result is an overall increase in useful illumination. Such an optical substrate comprises a surface characterized by a cross section of at least one prism having a curved sidewall or facet. In a second embodiment) the invention features a combination of a high index of refraction prismatic structure with a modified prism geometry. Brightneas performance is met or-exceeded, for example in on LCD back light display device, When the index of refraction of the prism structure is increased to a value above the index of refraction of materials commonly used in brightness enhancement film while the peak angle is allo3ved to increase beyond.90 degrees.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In Figure I a cross sectional view era backlight display device 100 is shown. The backlight display device 100 comprises an optical source 102 for generating light 104, A light guide 106 guides the light 104 therealong by total internal reflection (TIR), The light guide 106 contains disruptive features that cause the light 104 to escape the light guide 106. A reflective substrate 108 positioned along the lower surface of the light guide 106 reflects any light 104 escaping from the lower surface nf the light guido 106 back through the light guide 106 and toward an optical substrate 110. At least one optical substrate 110 is receptive of the light 104"from the light guide 106. The optical suhstrates 110 comprise a three-dimensinnal surface 112 defined by prismatic struotures 116 (Figs, 2, 3 and 4). The optical substrates ll0 may b e positioned, one above the other, in a crossed configuration wherein the prismatic structures 116 are positioned at an angle with respect to one another (e.g., 90 degrees) as seen in Figure 7. The prisms 116 have a prescribed peak angle, a, a height, h, a length, 1, and a pitch, p find one or both of the prismatic surfaces ! 12 may be randomized in their peak angle, a, beight, h, length, 1, and pitch, p. Yet further, one or both sides of the substrates 110 may have the prisms 116. In Figures 2, 3 and 4, in a.firat embodiment of the invention, the sidewall or facets 132 of the prisms 116 which comprise the surface 112 are curved. The curvature can be described as a segment of a parabola, or more generally as a polynomial surface van by the sag equation: cr 2 z = 1 + /1 - (1 + k )c r " " dr 2 + er ' d: ft'6 + Higher order terms in r(i) where z is the perpendicular deviatinn.(or "sag") In inicrons of the sidewall or facet 132 of the prisms 116 from a straight reference line 128, originating at a first reference point (b) at a b e of the prism and terminating at a second reference point (a) near the peak of the prism (see Figure 6) and c") is the radius of curvature of the facet. Here the coefficients of the polynomial may have the following approximate ranges: -20<c < 20,-10< d < 10,-10 <e< 10,-I0 < f< 10, and-1 <kor less than or equal to zero, wharf r is a radial coordinate or distance from an optical axis in microns. It is noted that c2r 2 is greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 1. Odd order terms in r (e.g., r I, is, i s, r 7, etc.) with appropriately chosen coefficients may also be used as in Eq. 1. The higher order terms for the even and odd order terms have appropriately chosen coefficients. Terms other than the first r 2 term may N be written as:.t . Linear segments 124, 126 or other approximations to the polynomial described by Eq. I may also be used as seen in Figure 6. Linear segments 124, 126 result in a compound angle prism having a first facet 126 at an angle of 0 and a second facet 124 atan angle of As best understood from Figure 6, the curvature of the curved sidewall or facet 132 oftbe prisms 116 can be either convex or eancave. In Figure 6, the side facets of the prism are positioned so as to form one or more compound facets 124, 126, respestivaly subtending an angle of iS or 0 with the base of the prism. Sample cross sections of the prisms 116, over a width w, are shown is Figures 2, 3 and 4. Figure 5 is a graphical depiction of brightness as a function of horizontal viewing angle for an optical substrate comprising a surface characterized first 11 g by a coast section of a right angled, straight-aided prism, second 122 by the curvod .sidewall or facet !n Figure 3, and third 120by the curved sidewall or facet in' Figure 4. As can be seen in Figure 5, for a right angled, straight-sided prism 118 the brightness shows significant side lobes 128, 130 at a horizontal view angle of approximately +/- 50 degrees. These aldelobes are not seen in either of the curved facetod prisms of Figures 3 and 4. However, there is a slight reduction in overall brightness for the curved prisms. As seen by comparing graph 122 with graph 120 in Figure 5, for a refractive index of approximately 1.6 in the optical substrate the steeper the curvature of the side wall the greater the reduction in ove fi brightness. Also, as seen in Figure 5, as the curvature of the facets increases away from the straight wall of a 90 degree prism, the wider is the central lobe and the lower is the central luminance and th sidelohes, In a second embodiment, a relatively high index of refraction for the optical substrate in combination with a modified prism ganmetry yields an enhanced brightness. In particular, Figure 8 displays a map of the central inminan in per cent of esossed optical substrates as a function of the prism peak angle and the refractive index of the substrate, wherein a refractive index of 1.6 and a peak angle of 90 degrees is taken to be 100 per cent. By increasing the peak angle to 100" degrees and increasing the refractive index of the optical substrate gunerally to greater than about 1.65 and ifi particular to between appreximately 1.7 and 1.8, the luminance is at least 102 per C Ilt. Figure 9 shows a graphical depiction of the far field horizontal luminance of crossed optical subsWates as a function of horizontal viewing angle. In Figure 9, a prior art luminance profile, based upon a refTactive index of 1.65 and a peak priam angle of degrees is shown at ! 50. As can be seen in Figure 9. the prior art shows sidelobas at g 152. By increasing the refractive index of the snbstrales to about 1.75 and the peak prism angle to about 100 degrees, as se n at 154, the central portion of the luminance profile (e.g. +/- 30 degrees) displays a higher peak luminance (about liB) with essentially no siddohes 156. Similarly, Figure I0 shows a graphical de 1 ietl 0 n of the far field vertical luminance of crossed optical substrates as a function of vertical viewing angle. In Figure 10, a prior ar luminance profile, based upon a refractive index of 1:6S and a peak prism angle of 90 degrees i's shown at 155. As can be seen in Figure 10, the prior art shows "sidelobes at 160. By increasing the refractive index of the substrates to about 1.75 and the peak prism angle to about 100 degrees, as n at 162, the can portion of the luminance profile (e.g. +/- 30 degrees) displays a higher peak luminance (about 118) with suppressed sidelines 164. Figure 11 shows a graphical depiction of the far fieM bor ontal luminance of esossnd optical substrates as a function of horizontal viewing angle. In Figure 1 !, a prior art luminance profile, based up m a refractive index of 1.60 and a peak prism angle ofgO degrees is shown at 166. As an be seen 1 igure 11, the prior art shows side-on at 168. As further seen at 170 in Figure 11, l y increasing the peak angin from degrees to about I00 degrees while keeping the refrasfiw index of the anbstrate at1.60, the sidelobes 172 are reduced slightly while he central segment of the luminance is only slightly less. Still further, by increasing the refractive Index of the substrates to about 1.75 and the peak prism angle to about lO0 degrees, as seen at 174, the central portion of the luminance profile (e.g. +/- 30 degrees) displays a slightly higher peak luminance (about 105) with slightly lower side-lobes 176. Similarly, Figure 12 shows a graphical depiction of the far field vertical inminance of crossed optical substrales as a function ofvexfical viewing angle. In Figure 12, a prior art luminance profile, based upon a refractive index of 1,60 and a peak prism angle of 90 degree's is shown at 178. As can be seen in Figure 12, the prior art shows side-lobes at 180 As further seen at 182 in Figure 12, by increasing the peak angle from 90 degrees to about 100 degrees while keeping the refractive index of the substrate at 1.60, the sidelohes 184 are reduced while the central segment of the luminance is only slightly less. Still further, by increasing the refractive index of the substrates to about 1:75 and the peak plasm angle to about 100 degrees, as seen at 186, the central portion of the luminance profile (e.g. +/- 30 degreas) displays a higher peak luminance (about 105) with slightly lower sidalobas 188. Thus, it can be seen from Figures 8 - 12 hst by increasing the refractive index'of the substrate 110 and/or by.increasJztg the peak angle; u, of the prism structures 116, an improvement is realized .in an increase in the on-axis luminance of the optical substrate 110 as well as areduction in the energy side-lobes of the horizontal and vertical luminance profile. The optical substrate 110 may be formed from an optically trans 1 arant polymer, an ultraviolet (UV) curable organic or inorga e material (or hybrid tbere, ot). In such an optical substrate 110, an index of refraction of reater than about 1,65 is preferred. Aside from the use of the optical stthst atas I 10 described above in backlight displays for brightness enhancement, the substrates can be used in a wide variety of other applications as well. Embodiments of the substrates ll0 can be used in Fresnal lenses, hybrid glass/plastic lenses, optical disks, diffuser films, holographic substrates or in combination with conventional lenses, prisms or minors. Such embodiments could be formed by modulating concentric circles or ellipses ha,(mg fixed characteristics. The optical substrate can also be used in single or multi-order reflective, transmissive or partially transmissive, devices, Whether light absorbing or non light absorbing; prisms, holographic optical elernants, or diffraction gretings. The substrates can be used in other applications such as projection displays, illuminated signs, and traffic signals. Anothes property of the invention is that the curved (or compound angle) facets increase the blurring of the light guide features. This is an advantage since it enhancea the visual appearance of the display.
