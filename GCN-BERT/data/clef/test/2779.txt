TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method for producing proteins, and more particularly, to a method for producing proteins including simultaneously performing expression and purification of target proteins in an automatic system using an automatic biological material purification apparatus including: a heating part; and a magnetic field applying part. BACKGROUND ART As a method for expressing recombinant proteins, a method for mainly using cells such as Escherichia coli and yeast, transforming a recombinant protein expression vector into the cell, and culturing the transformed cells to express proteins has been generally used. The above-described method requires a strain selection process which stably expresses recombinant protein and has a difficulty in expressing protein having toxicity in a cell, such that it takes at least several days to months to obtain one protein. Recently, a cell-free protein expression method synthesizing protein in a test tube without using cells has received attention, and various products related thereto has been developed. The cell-free protein expression method, which is a system of expressing protein by adding a template DNA capable of expressing protein, for example, an expression vector, a PCR product, a cell lysate, an expression solution, and a diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) distilled water into a tube, and performing a reaction at a proper temperature (30 to 40° C.) for a proper time (1 to 3 hours), has an advantage in that proteins having toxicity in a cell are capable of being expressed, and a required time may be remarkably reduced as compared to the above-mentioned method for expressing proteins using cells. Here, in order to express proteins, proper temperature and time are required. The reason is that an activity on an enzyme should be accompanied during all processes including synthesis of RNA from DNA in a tube and synthesis of protein from the RNA, wherein the above-described processes are capable of being performed in the case of maintaining a temperature when activities of a plurality of enzymes are shown, that is, 30 to 40° C. Since a plurality of proteins are mixed in a sample having expressed recombinant proteins, in order to easily purify the recombinant protein expressed from the sample, the expressed proteins should have an affinity with a specific material. Recently, a method for purification proteins by expressing a coupled state between recombinant protein and histidine and using an affinity of histidine and metal ions (nickel ion, cobalt ion, and the like) has been mainly used, and various products related thereto have been on sale. Among the methods, a method for using magnetic particles has been mainly used, wherein metal ions on a surface of the magnetic particles are coupled with histidine of the target protein, such that the target protein only is capable of being extracted from a plurality of proteins. However, according to the existing technologies according to the related art, high yield and high-purity purification may not be achieved and it is difficult to control protein complicated expression due to cell culture, which is non-effective, such that a basic issue which is reproducible production on the same proteins still has not been overcome. Therefore, a method for producing proteins capable of achieving high yield and high-purity purification and having reproducible synthesis efficiency on the same protein is required. Technical Problem The present inventors found a method for synthesis proteins including simultaneously performing expression and extraction of target proteins to be more effectively and easily performed as compared to the related art in a continuous study of an expression system effectively and easily controlling an expression of proteins and a method for biosynthesizing proteins using the same, thereby completing the present invention. An object of the present invention is to provide a method for synthesis proteins including simultaneously performing expression and extraction of target proteins in an automatic system using an automatic biological material purification apparatus including: a heating part; and a magnetic field applying part. In addition, an object of the present invention is to provide a protein synthesis kit simultaneously performing expression and purification of target proteins by combining a method for expressing cell-free protein with a method for purification protein using magnetic particles coupled with an affinity tag. Technical Solution In order to achieve objects of the present invention, there is provided a method for producing proteins capable of synthesizing and producing up to 16 kinds of target proteins within 6 hours using an automatic biological material purification apparatus including: a heating part; and a magnetic field applying part and applied by a combination of a method for expressing a cell-free protein with a method for purification proteins using magnetic particles coupled with an affinity tag. Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail. In one general aspect, a method for producing proteins includes: (1) preparing a template for cell-free protein synthesis; (2) adding the template to a cell-free protein expression solution to express proteins; (3) adding magnetic particles coupled with an affinity tag to the expressed protein to attach a target protein to the magnetic particles; and (4) separating the attached target protein from the magnetic particles, wherein expression and purification of the target protein are simultaneously performed in an automatic system using an automatic biological material purification apparatus including: a heating part; and a magnetic field applying part. A second multi well plate kit 420′ and a first multi well plate kit 420 may be used, the second multi well plate kit 420′ including: (a) a solution for diluting the template for cell-free protein synthesis; (b) the cell-free protein expression solution for expressing the target protein from the template; and the first multi well plate kit 420 including: (c) a magnetic particle solution for attaching the target protein to the magnetic particles; (d) an eluting solution for the target protein; (e) a magnetic particle reaction solution for coupling the target protein with the magnetic particle and a washing solution. In another general aspect, a method for producing proteins includes: (1) preparing a template for cell-free protein synthesis; (2) adding the template to a cell-free protein expression solution to express proteins; (3) adding magnetic particles coupled with an affinity tag to the expressed protein to attach a target protein to the magnetic particles; and (4) separating the attached target protein from the magnetic particles, wherein an automatic biological material purification apparatus including: a heating part; and a magnetic field applying part is used, a second multi well plate kit 420′ and a first multi well plate kit 420 are used, the second multi well plate kit including: (a) a solution for diluting the template for cell-free protein synthesis; (b) the cell-free protein expression solution for expressing the target protein from the template; and the first multi well plate kit including: (c) a magnetic particle solution for attaching the target protein; (d) an eluting solution for the target protein; (e) a magnetic particle reaction solution for coupling the target protein with the magnetic particle and a washing solution, and expression and purification of the target protein are simultaneously performed in an automatic system. The template for cell-free protein synthesis may be deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) having a circular form or a linear form. Preferably, a plasmid DNA may be used as the DNA having a circular form, a PCR product may be used as the DNA having a linear form, but the present invention is not limited thereto. In detail, the DNA having a linear form may be produced by obtaining a primary reactant by amplifying a target gene in a sample using a prepared primer set so as to amplify the target gene and provide overlapping sequences at 5′ and 3′ terminals and a premix for PCR; and secondarily amplifying the obtained primary reactant using the premix for PCR (hereinafter, referred to as ‘a kit for PCR’) containing the following composition A, [Composition A] (a) an upstream cassette set and a downstream cassette set positioned at both 5′ and 3′ terminals of the target gene, and (b) a secondary primer set having overlapping sequences at both 5′ and 3′ terminals of the cassette set.

In the present invention, a term: ‘cassette’ is collectively referred to as oligonucleotide having double strand which is shortly synthesized so as to be artificially connected to DNA product. Since a phosphate group is not found at 5′ terminal of the cassette, a single strand only in cassette consisting of double strands may be connected to a genome DNA. In the present invention, a term: ‘primer’, which is a singe strand nucleic acid sequence having a short and free 3′ hydroxyl group, indicates a short nucleic acid sequence forming a template and a base pair of a complementary nucleic acid and functioning as a starting point for a strand copy of an nucleic acid template.

Materials and methods used in Examples of the present invention are as follows. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Template DNA (1) Preparation of Plasmid DNA A template DNA-plasmid DNA was prepared for protein synthesis. Each gene was synthesized by a method for gene synthesis (NBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998, 248, 200-203), followed by treatment with a restriction enzyme, and cloning into an expression vector for E. coli. As the expression vector for E. coli, pBIVT (Bioneer Corporation, Korea), pIVEX (Roche, Germany), pET (Novagen, Germany), pK7, pQE, and the like, may be used, but the present invention is not limited thereto. In addition, the expression vector for E. coli, an affinity tag should be included in the expression vector. In the present Example, the expression vector including a histidine tag was used, and but the present invention is not limited thereto and thus, the expression vector may include another tag. In the present Example, CalmL3, RNaseH, DUSP3, CAT, AcGFP, EF-Ts, VF, Poly A polymerase, MMLV RTase, BM3, gene were used. More specifically, for the treatment with the restriction enzyme on a gene synthesis material, 1 μl of BamHI (Bioneer Corporation, Korea), 1 μl of NotI (Bioneer Corporation, Korea), 2 μl of 10× AccuCut™ buffer (Bioneer Corporation, Korea), 10 μl of gene synthesis material and 6 μl of sterile distilled water were added to each tube, mixed together, and disposed at a constant temperature of 37° C. for three hours. For the treatment with the restriction enzyme on an expression vector for E. coli, 1 μl of BamHI (Bioneer Corporation, Korea), 1 μl of NotI (Bioneer Corporation, Korea), 2 μl of 10× AccuCut™ buffer (Bioneer Corporation, Korea), 10 μl of expression vector for E. coli and 6 μl of sterile distilled water were added to each tube, mixed together, and disposed at a constant temperature of 37° C. for three hours. DNA was extracted from each reactant treated with each restriction enzyme using Accuprep Gel Extraction kit (Bioneer Corporation, Korea). 5 μl of 2× rapid ligation buffer (Promega Corporation, US), 1 μl of T4 DNA ligase (Promega Corporation, US), 3 μl of restriction enzyme treatment gene synthesis material, 1 μl of restriction enzyme treatment vector were added to a tube, mixed together, and disposed at a constant temperature of 16° C. for one hour. Then, 10 μl of the reaction solution disposed at constant temperature was put into 100 μl of E. coli competent cell, the mixture was placed on ice for 30 minutes and cultured at 42° C. for 90 seconds, and then placed again on ice for 5 minutes. The reactant was inoculated into a LB plate containing kanamycin and cultured at 37° C. for 16 hours. After white colony was taken and cultured in 10 ml of LB liquid medium for 16 hours, followed by centrifugation, the thus-obtained supernatant was removed and plasmid DNA was extracted from pellet using AccuPrep plasmid DNA prep kit (Bioneer Corporation, Korea). It was confirmed by sequencing whether or not the extracted DNA was gene synthesized by each gene synthesis method, and as DNA to be used for protein synthesis, corresponding colony was cultured to secure plasmid DNA by the same method.
