CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. 371 of international Patent Application No. PCT/US2011/038874, filed Jun. 2, 2011, which is a continuation-in-part of International Patent Application No. PCT/US10/61711, filed Dec. 22, 2010, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND Dentifrice formulations comprising peroxide are known and useful for cleaning and whitening teeth. The peroxide can bleach the teeth, remove stains, and kill cariogenic bacteria. However, peroxide compounds are highly reactive, and consequently difficult to formulate. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide can spontaneously decompose to form oxygen gas (O2) and water, so that on storage, the dentifrice containers may bloat, burst or leak, and the remaining formulation will not have enough peroxide remaining to clean and whiten teeth effectively. Some initially comprise very high levels of peroxide, which decomposes over time, so that the exact amount of peroxide delivered on application is variable and largely depends on how long and under what conditions the dentifrice has been stored. Abrasives comprising calcium phosphate salts, such as calcium pyrophosphate, dicalcium orthophosphate dihydrate, tricalcium phosphate, and calcium polymetaphosphate are useful in dentifrice materials, as in addition to providing an abrasive action which cleans the teeth, such salts provide a source of calcium and phosphate which can help build and repair the teeth. Calcium salts such as calcium carbonate are also commonly used as abrasives. However, under oxidizing conditions, calcium ions can readily form calcium peroxide (CaO2) and calcium oxide (CaO, also known as quicklime), which is highly reactive and corrosive, reacting exothermically with water for example to form calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). Thus dentifrices using calcium salts are not preferred for formulation with peroxide. Abrasive-free dentifrices comprising peroxide also present formulation challenges. While the problem with interaction with the abrasive is removed, the peroxide may still react with other components of the formulation and/or decompose to release O2. By exposure to aqueous environments, as in the oral cavity, the PVP-H2O2 dissociates into individual species (PVP polymer and H2O2). The PVP-H2O2 complex is generally comprised of about 80% by weight polyvinyl pyrrolidone and 20% by weight H2O2. Single phase whitening dentifrice compounds comprising PVP-H2O2 complexes are described, e.g., in WO/2007/037961, and its parent US Pub. No. US 2007-0071695 A1, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. While there are numerous publications of gels comprising peroxide, such gels are generally for use with dental trays or strips, rather than for application using a toothbrush, and such gels are not necessarily suitable for use as a dentifrice because they may adhere to the toothbrush, rather than rinsing off easily, and leave the consumer with an unpleasant experience due to the lack of foaming provided by the product. There is thus a need for improved peroxide dentifrice formulations that are stable for long-term storage and are suitable for everyday consumer use. SUMMARY In some embodiments, the present invention provides oral care compositions that are stable during long term storage and remain effective to clean and whiten teeth. In some embodiments, the invention provides an oral care composition comprising: (i) a crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone complexed with hydrogen peroxide and (ii) an abrasive. In some embodiments, the abrasive is a calcium abrasive. In other embodiments, the invention provides an oral care composition comprising a crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone complexed with hydrogen peroxide, and a stabilizing amount of additional linear and/or crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone. In further embodiments, the invention provides an oral care composition comprising (i) a crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone complexed with hydrogen peroxide, and an ethylene oxide, propylene oxide block co-polymer of formula (ethylene oxide)x-(propylene oxide)y wherein x is an integer of 80-150 and y is an integer 30-80, having an average molecular weight of greater than 5000 Da. Further embodiments of the invention will be apparent from the detailed description and the examples.

EXAMPLES Example 1 A gel dentifrice having a peroxide composition of about 1% is prepared having the following ingredients: TABLE 1 Ingredient % (w/w) 85% syrupy phosphoric acid 0.2 PEG118/PPG66 co-polymer 5 Glycerin 47 Propylene glycol 15 PEG 600 10 PVP 10 Crosslinked PVP/H2O2 5.5 TSPP 2 Sucralose 0.05 Sodium saccharine 0.6 Sodium monofluorophosphate 0.76 Sodium lauryl sulfate 2 BHT 0.03 Mint flavor 2 Example 2 A gel dentifrice having a peroxide composition of about 1% is prepared having the following ingredients: TABLE 2 Ingredient % (w/w) 85% syrupy phosphoric acid 0.2 Glycerin 25.36 PEG118/PPG66 co-polymer 7.5 PEG 600 10 Propylene glycol 25 Crosslinked PVP/H2O2 5.5 TSPP 2 Sucralose 0.05 Sodium saccharin 0.6 Sodium monofluorophosphate 0.76 Calcium pyrophosphate 10 PVP 9 BHT 0.03 Flavor 2 Sucralose 0.05 Sodium lauryl sulfate 2 Example 3 A toothpaste having a peroxide content of about 1% is prepared with the following ingredients: TABLE 3 Ingredient % (w/w) 85% syrupy phosphoric acid 0.2 PEG118/PPG66 co-polymer 10 Glycerin 5 PEG 600 10 Propylene glycol 25 Crosslinked PVP/H2O2 5.5 TSPP 2 Sucralose 0.05 Sodium saccharine 0.6 Sodium monofluorophosphate 0.76 Calcium pyrophosphate 35 Fumed silica 1.5 BHT 0.03 Mint flavor 2.25 Example 4 The in vitro whitening efficacy of the compositions of Examples 1 and 3 are tested versus commercial whitening dentifrices. Brushing Test: The in vitro whitening efficacy of the products is tested by brushing experiments. Bovine teeth are prophy stained to achieve similar initial lightness values. The bovine teeth are mounted in a tray for brushing study. A 1:1 slurry of dentifrice to deionized water is prepared and 25 grams added to brushing tray. The stained bovine teeth are brushed for for 20 minutes at 120 strokes/min. This is intended to approximate one week of bushing (1.5 min brushing, twice a day for seven days=21 minutes/week). Teeth are rinsed with 100 g deionized water, then the color (L*a*b* values) is measured with a spectrophotometer. This is repeated three times. The spectrophotometer used is Spectroshade from MHT. The measurement scale is the CIE L*a*b* (CIELAB) scale developed by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). CIELAB is an opponent color system based on the fact that retinal color stimuli are translated into distinctions between light and dark, red and green, and blue and yellow. CIELAB indicates these values with three axes: L*, a*, and b*. The L value indicates the lightness of a color, where L=0 is black and L=100 is white. ΔL=Lbrushed−Linitial. Thus, a larger positive ΔL value=whiter teeth. The a value ranges between +a=magenta and −a=green. The b value ranges between +b=yellow and −b=blue. The W value incorporates the L, a and b values to describe how close the measured color is to true white, where W*=(a2+b2+(L*−100)2)½. A larger negative ΔW value corresponds to greater whitening. In comparing the toothpaste formulation of Example 3 with a leading commercial whitening toothpaste (Brand A), the formulation of Example 3 shows significantly greater whitening: TABLE 4 ΔL using Brand A and Example 3: 20 mins 40 mins 60 mins 80 mins Brand A 2.1 + 0.6 3.1 + 0.7 3.6 + 0.6 3.8 + 1.0 Example 3 4.4 + 0.9 5.4 + 0.9 6.5 + 1.0 7.5 + 0.9 TABLE 5 ΔW using Brand A and Example 3: 20 mins 40 mins 60 mins 80 mins Brand A −2.2 + 0.5 −3.1 + 0.6 −3.5 + 0.4 −3.6 + 0.9 Example 3 −4.0 + 0.9 −4.8 + 1.4 −6.1 + 1.6 −7.0 + 1.3 Similar results are obtained with the gel of Example 1. After four cycles of brushing (80 minutes), the ΔL and ΔW are as follows: TABLE 6 ΔL and ΔW using Brand A and Example 1 ΔL ΔW Brand A 3.8 + 1.0 −3.6 + 0.9 Example 1 7.3 + 2.6 −6.0 + 2.8 Bleaching Test: Hard abrasive particles serve to break up the stain during the act of brushing when they are rubbed against the stain by the bristles of the toothbrush. Peroxide whitens both extrinsic (surface stains) and intrinsic stains (below the surface of enamel) through a chemical reaction in which the unsaturated bonds in colored stain molecules are oxidized by peroxide to become colorless. In this test method stained hydroxyapatite disks are soaked in dentifrice slurry. As disks are soaked, rather than brushed, stains will be bleached by toothpaste containing peroxide but should not be removed by toothpastes containing only abrasives. The substrate used is 1″ diameter hydroxyapatite (HAP) disks (human enamel is ˜96% hydroxyapatite by weight; human dentin is ˜70% hydroxyapatite by weight). The HAP are stained using a mixture of common foods that stain teeth: 1 part 1% instant coffee solution (Maxwell House), 1 part brewed black tea (Lipton Black Tea soaked for 2 min in hot water), 1 part red wine (Cabernet). The HAP disks are soaked overnight in artificial saliva. The saliva treated disks are soaked in staining solution for 2 hrs, rinsed with water, and dried. The disks are then soaked in a stifling dentifrice slurry for 2 min, rinsed with water and dried.

Example 5 The objective of the consumer test is to determine how the two test formulas with peroxide compare in consumer preference and whitening performance after 2 weeks of use vs. the leading peroxide and nonperoxide competition. Two Week Results: Both Examples 1 and 3 deliver higher % of noticeable whitening amongst consumers who perceived their teeth to be whiter vs. Brand A after 1 week of use [71% for Example 1 (1% gel), 77% for Example 3 (1% paste), 58% for Brand A]. Also two statements come up higher for both Examples than for Brand A: “This toothpaste gives me 360 degree coverage for an all over white” and “This toothpaste is the most convenient way to get noticeably whiter teeth in just 1 week”. Both Examples were significantly better than Brand B in overall and taste liking. Example 6 The toothpaste of Example 3 is tested for stability versus a commercially available 1% peroxide toothpaste. Peroxide-containing compositions which bloat to an unacceptable extent would not be expected to provide the level of whitening suitable for a toothpaste composition. Tube Bloating: The diameter of the tube is measured at the bottom (close to cap), the midpoint, and the top (close to crimp), before and after 1 week of aging at 60° C. The elevated temperature accelerates the aging, approximating the degree of degradation that can be expected to occur over long-term storage at room temperature.

GmbH, Berlin), which measures separation of the product by measuring optical transmission through the tube as a function of time. The results show that it takes longer for Example 3 to separate than Brand B: TABLE 10 Sample Example 3 Brand B Time to Separation at 133 ± 5 40 ± 10 2050 rpm (mins) Example 7 Bloating Study A bloating study was also conducted on gel based abrasive containing compositions of the present invention to evaluate their chemical stability profiles.
