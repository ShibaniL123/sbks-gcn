TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention is generally related to modified or mutated respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) proteins and methods for making and using them, including immunogenic compositions such as vaccines for the treatment and/or prevention of RSV infection. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a member of the genus Pneumovirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. Human RSV (HRSV) is the leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in young children and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in humans. RSV is also recognized as an important agent of disease in immunocompromised adults and in the elderly. Due to incomplete resistance to RSV in the infected host after a natural infection, RSV may infect multiple times during childhood and adult life. This virus has a genome comprised of a single strand negative-sense RNA, which is tightly associated with viral protein to form the nucleocapsid. The viral envelope is composed of a plasma membrane derived lipid bilayer that contains virally encoded structural proteins. A viral polymerase is packaged with the virion and transcribes genomic RNA into mRNA. The RSV genome encodes three transmembrane structural proteins, F, G, and SH, two matrix proteins, M and M2, three nucleocapsid proteins N, P, and L, and two nonstructural proteins, NS1 and NS2. Fusion of HRSV and cell membranes is thought to occur at the cell surface and is a necessary step for the transfer of viral ribonucleoprotein into the cell cytoplasm during the early stages of infection. This process is mediated by the fusion (F) protein, which also promotes fusion of the membrane of infected cells with that of adjacent cells to form a characteristic syncytia, which is both a prominent cytopathic effect and an additional mechanism of viral spread. Accordingly, neutralization of fusion activity is important in host immunity. Indeed, monoclonal antibodies developed against the F protein have been shown to neutralize virus infectivity and inhibit membrane fusion (Calder et al., 2000, Virology 271: 122-131). The F protein of RSV shares structural features and limited, but significant amino acid sequence identity with F glycoproteins of other paramyxoviruses. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor of 574 amino acids (F0) that is cotranslationally glycosylated on asparagines in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it assembles into homo-oligomers. Before reaching the cell surface, the F0 precursor is cleaved by a protease into F2 from the N terminus and F1 from the C terminus. The F2 and F1 chains remain covalently linked by one or more disulfide bonds. Immunoaffinity purified full-length F proteins have been found to accumulate in the form of micelles (also characterized as rosettes), similar to those observed with other full-length virus membrane glycoproteins (Wrigley et al., 1986, in Electron Microscopy of Proteins, Vol 5, p. 103-163, Academic Press, London). Under electron microscopy, the molecules in the rosettes appear either as inverted cone-shaped rods (˜70%) or lollipop-shaped (˜30%) structures with their wider ends projecting away from the centers of the rosettes. The rod conformational state is associated with an F glycoprotein in the pre-fusion inactivate state while the lollipop conformational state is associated with an F glycoprotein in the post-fusion, active state. Electron micrography can be used to distinguish between the prefusion and postfusion (alternatively designated prefusogenic and fusogenic) conformations, as demonstrated by Calder et al., 2000, Virology 271:122-131. The prefusion conformation can also be distinguished from the fusogenic (postfusion) conformation by liposome association assays. Additionally, prefusion and fusogenic conformations can be distinguished using antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) that specifically recognize conformation epitopes present on one or the other of the prefusion or fusogenic form of the RSV F protein, but not on the other form. Such conformation epitopes can be due to preferential exposure of an antigenic determinant on the surface of the molecule. Alternatively, conformational epitopes can arise from the juxtaposition of amino acids that are non-contiguous in the linear polypeptide. It has been shown previously that the F precursor is cleaved at two sites (site I, after residue 109 and site II, after residue 136), both preceded by motifs recognized by furin-like proteases. Site II is adjacent to a fusion peptide, and cleavage of the F protein at both sites is needed for membrane fusion (Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2001, PNAS 98(17): 9859-9864). When cleavage is completed at both sites, it is believed that there is a transition from cone-shaped to lollipop-shaped rods. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION As described herein, the present inventors have found that surprisingly high levels of expression of the fusion (F) protein can be achieved when certain modifications are made to the structure of the RSV F protein. Such modifications also unexpectedly reduce the cellular toxicity of the RSV F protein in a host cell. In addition, the modified F proteins of the present invention demonstrate an improved ability to exhibit the post-fusion “lollipop” morphology as opposed to the pre-fusion “rod” morphology. Thus, in one aspect, the modified F proteins of the present invention can also exhibit improved immunogenicity as compared to wild-type F proteins. These modifications have significant applications to the development of vaccines and methods of using said vaccines for the treatment and/or prevention of RSV. The present invention provides recombinant RSV F proteins that demonstrate increased expression, reduced cellular toxicity, and/or enhanced immunogenic properties as compared to wild-type RSV F proteins. In one aspect, the invention provides recombinant RSV F proteins comprising modified or mutated amino acid sequences as compared to wild-type RSV F proteins.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions As used herein, the term “adjuvant” refers to a compound that, when used in combination with a specific immunogen (e.g. a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein) in a formulation, will augment or otherwise alter or modify the resultant immune response. Modification of the immune response includes intensification or broadening the specificity of either or both antibody and cellular immune responses. Modification of the immune response can also mean decreasing or suppressing certain antigen-specific immune responses. As used herein, the term “antigenic formulation” or “antigenic composition” refers to a preparation which, when administered to a vertebrate, especially a bird or a mammal, will induce an immune response. As used herein, the term “avian influenza virus” refers to influenza viruses found chiefly in birds but that can also infect humans or other animals. In some instances, avian influenza viruses may be transmitted or spread from one human to another. An avian influenza virus that infects humans has the potential to cause an influenza pandemic, i.e., morbidity and/or mortality in humans. A pandemic occurs when a new strain of influenza virus (a virus against which humans have no natural immunity) emerges, spreading beyond individual localities, possibly around the globe, and infecting many humans at once. As used herein, an “effective dose” generally refers to that amount of a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein of the invention sufficient to induce immunity, to prevent and/or ameliorate an infection or to reduce at least one symptom of an infection or disease, and/or to enhance the efficacy of another dose of a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein. An effective dose may refer to the amount of a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein sufficient to delay or minimize the onset of an infection or disease. An effective dose may also refer to the amount of a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of an infection or disease. Further, an effective dose is the amount with respect to a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein of the invention alone, or in combination with other therapies, that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of an infection or disease. An effective dose may also be the amount sufficient to enhance a subject's (e.g., a human's) own immune response against a subsequent exposure to an infectious agent or disease. Levels of immunity can be monitored, e.g., by measuring amounts of neutralizing secretory and/or serum antibodies, e.g., by plaque neutralization, complement fixation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent, or microneutralization assay, or by measuring cellular responses, such as, but not limited to cytotoxic T cells, antigen presenting cells, helper T cells, dendritic cells and/or other cellular responses. T cell responses can be monitored, e.g., by measuring, for example, the amount of CD4+ and CD8+ cells present using specific markers by fluorescent flow cytometry or T cell assays, such as but not limited to T-cell proliferation assay, T-cell cytotoxic assay, TETRAMER assay, and/or ELISPOT assay. In the case of a vaccine, an “effective dose” is one that prevents disease and/or reduces the severity of symptoms. As used herein, the term “effective amount” refers to an amount of a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein necessary or sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect. An effective amount of the composition would be the amount that achieves a selected result, and such an amount could be determined as a matter of routine experimentation by a person skilled in the art. For example, an effective amount for preventing, treating and/or ameliorating an infection could be that amount necessary to cause activation of the immune system, resulting in the development of an antigen specific immune response upon exposure to a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein of the invention. The term is also synonymous with “sufficient amount.” As used herein, the term “expression” refers to the process by which polynucleic acids are transcribed into mRNA and translated into peptides, polypeptides, or proteins. If the polynucleic acid is derived from genomic DNA, expression may, if an appropriate eukaryotic host cell or organism is selected, include splicing of the mRNA. In the context of the present invention, the term also encompasses the yield of RSV F gene mRNA and RSV F proteins achieved following expression thereof. As used herein, the term “F protein” or “Fusion protein” or “F protein polypeptide” or “Fusion protein polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide or protein having all or part of an amino acid sequence of an RSV Fusion protein polypeptide. Similarly, the term “G protein” or “G protein polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide or protein having all or part of an amino acid sequence of an RSV Attachment protein polypeptide. Numerous RSV Fusion and Attachment proteins have been described and are known to those of skill in the art. WO/2008/114149, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, sets out exemplary F and G protein variants (for example, naturally occurring variants). As used herein, the terms “immunogens” or “antigens” refer to substances such as proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids that are capable of eliciting an immune response. Both terms also encompass epitopes, and are used interchangeably. As used herein the term “immune stimulator” refers to a compound that enhances an immune response via the body's own chemical messengers (cytokines). These molecules comprise various cytokines, lymphokines and chemokines with immunostimulatory, immunopotentiating, and pro-inflammatory activities, such as interferons (IFN-γ), interleukins (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13); growth factors (e.g., granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-colony stimulating factor (CSF)); and other immunostimulatory molecules, such as macrophage inflammatory factor, Flt3 ligand, B7.1; B7.2, etc. The immune stimulator molecules can be administered in the same formulation as VLPs of the invention, or can be administered separately. Either the protein or an expression vector encoding the protein can be administered to produce an immunostimulatory effect. As used herein, the term “immunogenic formulation” refers to a preparation which, when administered to a vertebrate, e.g. a mammal, will induce an immune response. As used herein, the term “infectious agent” refers to microorganisms that cause an infection in a vertebrate. Usually, the organisms are viruses, bacteria, parasites, protozoa and/or fungi. As used herein, the terms “mutated,” “modified,” “mutation,” or “modification” indicate any modification of a nucleic acid and/or polypeptide which results in an altered nucleic acid or polypeptide. Mutations include, for example, point mutations, deletions, or insertions of single or multiple residues in a polynucleotide, which includes alterations arising within a protein-encoding region of a gene as well as alterations in regions outside of a protein-encoding sequence, such as, but not limited to, regulatory or promoter sequences. A genetic alteration may be a mutation of any type. For instance, the mutation may constitute a point mutation, a frame-shift mutation, an insertion, or a deletion of part or all of a gene. In some embodiments, the mutations are naturally-occurring. In other embodiments, the mutations are the results of artificial mutation pressure. In still other embodiments, the mutations in the RSV F proteins are the result of genetic engineering. As used herein, the term “multivalent” refers to compositions which have one or more antigenic proteins/peptides or immunogens against multiple types or strains of infectious agents or diseases. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable vaccine” refers to a formulation which contains a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein of the present invention, which is in a form that is capable of being administered to a vertebrate and which induces a protective immune response sufficient to induce immunity to prevent and/or ameliorate an infection or disease, and/or to reduce at least one symptom of an infection or disease, and/or to enhance the efficacy of another dose of a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein. Typically, the vaccine comprises a conventional saline or buffered aqueous solution medium in which the composition of the present invention is suspended or dissolved. In this form, the composition of the present invention can be used conveniently to prevent, ameliorate, or otherwise treat an infection. Upon introduction into a host, the vaccine is able to provoke an immune response including, but not limited to, the production of antibodies and/or cytokines and/or the activation of cytotoxic T cells, antigen presenting cells, helper T cells, dendritic cells and/or other cellular responses. As used herein, the phrase “protective immune response” or “protective response” refers to an immune response mediated by antibodies against an infectious agent or disease, which is exhibited by a vertebrate (e.g., a human), that prevents or ameliorates an infection or reduces at least one disease symptom thereof. Modified or mutated RSV F proteins, RSV F micelles comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or VLPs comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein of the invention can stimulate the production of antibodies that, for example, neutralize infectious agents, blocks infectious agents from entering cells, blocks replication of the infectious agents, and/or protect host cells from infection and destruction. The term can also refer to an immune response that is mediated by T-lymphocytes and/or other white blood cells against an infectious agent or disease, exhibited by a vertebrate (e.g., a human), that prevents or ameliorates infection or disease, or reduces at least one symptom thereof. As used herein, the term “vertebrate” or “subject” or “patient” refers to any member of the subphylum cordata, including, without limitation, humans and other primates, including non-human primates such as chimpanzees and other apes and monkey species. Farm animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and horses; domestic mammals such as dogs and cats; laboratory animals including rodents such as mice, rats (including cotton rats) and guinea pigs; birds, including domestic, wild and game birds such as chickens, turkeys and other gallinaceous birds, ducks, geese, and the like are also non-limiting examples. The terms “mammals” and “animals” are included in this definition. Both adult and newborn individuals are intended to be covered. In particular, infants and young children are appropriate subjects or patients for a RSV vaccine. As used herein, the term “virus-like particle” (VLP) refers to a structure that in at least one attribute resembles a virus but which has not been demonstrated to be infectious. Virus-like particles in accordance with the invention do not carry genetic information encoding for the proteins of the virus-like particles. In general, virus-like particles lack a viral genome and, therefore, are noninfectious. In addition, virus-like particles can often be produced in large quantities by heterologous expression and can be easily purified. As used herein, the term “chimeric VLP” refers to VLPs that contain proteins, or portions thereof, from at least two different infectious agents (heterologous proteins). Usually, one of the proteins is derived from a virus that can drive the formation of VLPs from host cells. Examples, for illustrative purposes, are the BRSV M protein and/or the HRSV G or F proteins. The terms RSV VLPs and chimeric VLPs can be used interchangeably where appropriate. As used herein, the term “vaccine” refers to a preparation of dead or weakened pathogens, or of derived antigenic determinants that is used to induce formation of antibodies or immunity against the pathogen. A vaccine is given to provide immunity to the disease, for example, influenza, which is caused by influenza viruses. In addition, the term “vaccine” also refers to a suspension or solution of an immunogen (e.g. a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein) that is administered to a vertebrate to produce protective immunity, i.e., immunity that prevents or reduces the severity of disease associated with infection. The present invention provides for vaccine compositions that are immunogenic and may provide protection against a disease associated with infection. RSV F Proteins RSV-F proteins and methods are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/633,995, filed Dec. 9, 2009 (published Sep. 23, 2010 as U.S. Publication No. 2010/0239617), U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/121,126, filed Dec. 9, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/169,077, filed Apr. 14, 2009, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/224,787, filed Jul. 10, 2009, the disclosures of which are each incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. Two structural membrane proteins, F and G proteins, are expressed on the surface of RSV, and have been shown to be targets of neutralizing antibodies (Sullender, W., 2000, Clinical Microbiology Review 13, 1-15). These two proteins are also primarily responsible for viral recognition and entry into target cells; G protein binds to a specific cellular receptor and the F protein promotes fusion of the virus with the cell. The F protein is also expressed on the surface of infected cells and is responsible for subsequent fusion with other cells leading to syncytia formation. Thus, antibodies to the F protein can neutralize virus or block entry of the virus into the cell or prevent syncytia formation. Although antigenic and structural differences between A and B subtypes have been described for both the G and F proteins, the more significant antigenic differences reside on the G protein, where amino acid sequences are only 53% homologous and antigenic relatedness is 5% (Walsh et al. (1987) J. Infect. Dis. 155, 1198-1204; and Johnson et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 5625-5629). Conversely, antibodies raised to the F protein show a high degree of cross-reactivity among subtype A and B viruses. The RSV F protein directs penetration of RSV by fusion between the virion's envelope protein and the host cell plasma membrane. Later in infection, the F protein expressed on the cell surface can mediate fusion with neighboring cells to form syncytia. The F protein is a type I transmembrane surface protein that has a N-terminal cleaved signal peptide and a membrane anchor near the C-terminus. RSV F is synthesized as an inactive F0 precursor that assembles into a homotrimer and is activated by cleavage in the trans-Golgi complex by a cellular endoprotease to yield two disulfide-linked subunits, F1 and F2 subunits. The N-terminus of the F1 subunit that is created by cleavage contains a hydrophobic domain (the fusion peptide) that inserts directly into the target membrane to initiate fusion. The F1 subunit also contains heptad repeats that associate during fusion, driving a conformational shift that brings the viral and cellular membranes into close proximity (Collins and Crowe, 2007, Fields Virology, 5th ed., D. M Kipe et al., Lipincott, Williams and Wilkons, p. 1604). SEQ ID NO: 2 (GenBank Accession No. AAB59858) depicts a representative RSV F protein, which is encoded by the gene shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 (GenBank Accession No. M11486). In nature, the RSV F protein is expressed as a single polypeptide precursor, 574 amino acids in length, designated FO. In vivo, FO oligomerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and is proteolytically processed by a furin protease at two conserved furin consensus sequences (furin cleavage sites), RARR (SEQ ID NO: 23) (secondary) and KKRKRR (SEQ ID NO: 24) (primary) to generate an oligomer consisting of two disulfide-linked fragments. The smaller of these fragments is termed F2 and originates from the N-terminal portion of the FO precursor. It will be recognized by those of skill in the art that the abbreviations FO, F1 and F2 are commonly designated F0, F1 and F2 in the scientific literature. The larger, C-terminal F1 fragment anchors the F protein in the membrane via a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids, which are adjacent to a 24 amino acid cytoplasmic tail. Three F2-F1 dimers associate to form a mature F protein, which adopts a metastable prefusogenic (“prefusion”) conformation that is triggered to undergo a conformational change upon contact with a target cell membrane. This conformational change exposes a hydrophobic sequence, known as the fusion peptide, which associates with the host cell membrane and promotes fusion of the membrane of the virus, or an infected cell, with the target cell membrane. The F1 fragment contains at least two heptad repeat domains, designated HRA and HRB, and is situated in proximity to the fusion peptide and transmembrane anchor domains, respectively. In the prefusion conformation, the F2-F1 dimer forms a globular head and stalk structure, in which the HRA domains are in a segmented (extended) conformation in the globular head. In contrast, the HRB domains form a three-stranded coiled coil stalk extending from the head region. During transition from the prefusion to the postfusion conformations, the HRA domains collapse and are brought into proximity to the HRB domains to form an anti-parallel six helix bundle. In the postfusion state the fusion peptide and transmembrane domains are juxtaposed to facilitate membrane fusion. Although the conformational description provided above is based on molecular modeling of crystallographic data, the structural distinctions between the prefusion and postfusion conformations can be monitored without resort to crystallography. For example, electron micrography can be used to distinguish between the prefusion and postfusion (alternatively designated prefusogenic and fusogenic) conformations, as demonstrated by Calder et al., Virology, 271:122-131 (2000) and Morton et al., Virology, 311: 275-288, which are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of their technological teachings. The prefusion conformation can also be distinguished from the fusogenic (post-fusion) conformation by liposome association assays as described by Connolly et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 103:17903-17908 (2006), which is also incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of its technological teachings. Additionally, prefusion and fusogenic conformations can be distinguished using antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) that specifically recognize conformation epitopes present on one or the other of the prefusion or fusogenic form of the RSV F protein, but not on the other form. Such conformation epitopes can be due to preferential exposure of an antigenic determinant on the surface of the molecule. Alternatively, conformational epitopes can arise from the juxtaposition of amino acids that are non-contiguous in the linear polypeptide. Modified or Mutated RSV F Proteins The present inventors have found that surprisingly high levels of expression of the fusion (F) protein can be achieved when specific modifications are made to the structure of the RSV F protein. Such modifications also unexpectedly reduce the cellular toxicity of the RSV F protein in a host cell. In addition, the modified F proteins of the present invention demonstrate an improved ability to exhibit the post-fusion “lollipop” morphology as opposed to the pre-fusion “rod” morphology. Thus, in one aspect, the modified F proteins of the present invention can also exhibit improved (e.g. enhanced) immunogenicity as compared to wild-type F proteins (e.g. exemplified by SEQ ID NO: 2, which corresponds to GenBank Accession No. AAB59858). These modifications have significant applications to the development of vaccines and methods of using said vaccines for the treatment and/or prevention of RSV. In accordance with the invention, any number of mutations can be made to native or wild-type RSV F proteins, and in a preferred aspect, multiple mutations can be made to result in improved expression and/or immunogenic properties as compared to native or wild-type RSV F proteins. Such mutations include point mutations, frame shift mutations, deletions, and insertions, with one or more (e.g., one, two, three, or four, etc.) mutations preferred. The native F protein polypeptide can be selected from any F protein of an RSV A strain, RSV B strain, HRSV A strain, HRSV B strain, BRSV strain, or avian RSV strain, or from variants thereof (as defined above). In certain exemplary embodiments, the native F protein polypeptide is the F protein represented by SEQ ID NO: 2 (GenBank Accession No AAB59858). To facilitate understanding of this disclosure, all amino acid residue positions, regardless of strain, are given with respect to (that is, the amino acid residue position corresponds to) the amino acid position of the exemplary F protein. Comparable amino acid positions of the F protein from other RSV strains can be determined easily by those of ordinary skill in the art by aligning the amino acid sequences of the selected RSV strain with that of the exemplary sequence using readily available and well-known alignment algorithms (such as BLAST, e.g., using default parameters). Numerous additional examples of F protein polypeptides from different RSV strains are disclosed in WO/2008/114149 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Additional variants can arise through genetic drift, or can be produced artificially using site directed or random mutagenesis, or by recombination of two or more preexisting variants. Such additional variants are also suitable in the context of the modified or mutated RSV F proteins disclosed herein. Mutations may be introduced into the RSV F proteins of the present invention using any methodology known to those skilled in the art. Mutations may be introduced randomly by, for example, conducting a PCR reaction in the presence of manganese as a divalent metal ion cofactor. Alternatively, oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis may be used to create the mutant or modified RSV F proteins which allows for all possible classes of base pair changes at any determined site along the encoding DNA molecule. In general, this technique involves annealing an oligonucleotide complementary (except for one or more mismatches) to a single stranded nucleotide sequence coding for the RSV F protein of interest. The mismatched oligonucleotide is then extended by DNA polymerase, generating a double-stranded DNA molecule which contains the desired change in sequence in one strand. The changes in sequence can, for example, result in the deletion, substitution, or insertion of an amino acid. The double-stranded polynucleotide can then be inserted into an appropriate expression vector, and a mutant or modified polypeptide can thus be produced. The above-described oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis can, for example, be carried out via PCR. Additional RSV Proteins The invention also encompasses RSV virus-like particles (VLPs) comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein that can be formulated into vaccines or antigenic formulations for protecting vertebrates (e.g. humans) against RSV infection or at least one disease symptom thereof. In some embodiments, the VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein further comprises additional RSV proteins, such as M, N, G, and SH. In other embodiments, the VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein further comprises proteins from heterologous strains of virus, such as influenza virus proteins HA, NA, and M1. In one embodiment, the influenza virus protein M1 is derived from an avian influenza virus strain. RSV N protein binds tightly to both genomic RNA and the replicative intermediate anti-genomic RNA to form RNAse resistant nucleocapsid. SEQ ID NOs: 16 (wild-type) and 18 (codon-optimized) depict representative amino acid sequences of the RSV N protein and SEQ ID NOs: 15 (wild-type) and 17 (codon-optimized) depict representative nucleic acid sequences encoding the RSV N protein. Encompassed in this invention are RSV N proteins that are at least about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70% or about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98% or about 99% identical to SEQ ID NO: 18, and all fragments and variants (including chimeric proteins) thereof. RSV M protein is a non-glycosylated internal virion protein that accumulates in the plasma membrane that interacts with RSV F protein and other factors during virus morphogenesis. In certain preferred embodiments, the RSV M protein is a bovine RSV (BRSV) M protein. SEQ ID NOs: 12 (wild-type) and 14 (codon-optimized) depict representative amino acid sequences of the BRSV M protein and SEQ ID NOs: 11 (wild-type) and 13 (codon-optimized) depict representative nucleic acid sequences encoding the BRSV M protein. Encompassed in this invention are RSV (including, but not limited to, BRSV) M proteins that are at least about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70% or about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98% or about 99% identical to SEQ ID NOs: 12 and 14, and all fragments and variants (including chimeric proteins) thereof. RSV G protein is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a single hydrophobic region near the N-terminal end that serves as both an uncleaved signal peptide and a membrane anchor, leaving the C-terminal two-thirds of the molecule oriented externally. RSV G is also expressed as a secreted protein that arises from translational initiation at the second AUG in the ORF (at about amino acid 48), which lies within the signal/anchor. Most of the ectodomain of RSV G is highly divergent between RSV strains (Id., p. 1607). SEQ ID NO: 26 depicts a representative RSV G protein, which is encoded by the gene sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 25. Encompassed in this invention are RSV G proteins that are at least about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70% or about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98% or about 99% identical to SEQ ID NO: 26, and all fragments and variants (including chimeric proteins) thereof. The SH protein of RSV is a type II transmembrane protein that contains 64 (RSV subgroup A) or 65 amino acid residues (RSV subgroup B). Some studies have suggested that the RSV SH protein may have a role in viral fusion or in changing membrane permeability. However, RSV lacking the SH gene are viable, cause syncytia formation and grow as well as the wild-type virus, indicating that the SH protein is not necessary for virus entry into host cells or syncytia formation. The SH protein of RSV has shown the ability of inhibit TNF-α signaling. SEQ ID NO: 27 depicts a representative amino acid sequence of the RSV SH protein. Encompassed in this invention are RSV SH proteins that are at least about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70% or about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98% or about 99% identical to SEQ ID NO: 27, and all fragments and variants (including chimeric proteins) thereof. RSV Vaccines Currently, the only approved approach to prophylaxis of RSV disease is passive immunization. Initial evidence suggesting a protective role for IgG was obtained from observations involving maternal antibody in ferrets (Prince, G. A., Ph.D. diss., University of California, Los Angeles, 1975) and humans (Lambrecht et al., (1976) J. Infect. Dis. 134, 211-217; and Glezen et al. (1981) J. Pediatr. 98, 708-715). Hemming et al. (Morell et al., eds., 1986, Clinical Use of Intravenous Immunoglobulins, Academic Press, London at pages 285-294) recognized the possible utility of RSV antibody in treatment or prevention of RSV infection during studies involving the pharmacokinetics of an intravenous immunoglobulin (WIG) in newborns suspected of having neonatal sepsis. They noted that one infant, whose respiratory secretions yielded RSV, recovered rapidly after WIG infusion. Subsequent analysis of the IVIG lot revealed an unusually high titer of RSV neutralizing antibody. This same group of investigators then examined the ability of hyper-immune serum or immunoglobulin, enriched for RSV neutralizing antibody, to protect cotton rats and primates against RSV infection (Prince et al. (1985) Virus Res. 3, 193-206; Prince et al. (1990) J. Virol. 64, 3091-3092. Results of these studies suggested that RSV neutralizing antibody given prophylactically inhibited respiratory tract replication of RSV in cotton rats. When given therapeutically, RSV antibody reduced pulmonary viral replication both in cotton rats and in a nonhuman primate model. Furthermore, passive infusion of immune serum or immune globulin did not produce enhanced pulmonary pathology in cotton rats subsequently challenged with RSV. Since RSV infection can be prevented by providing neutralizing antibodies to a vertebrate, a vaccine comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein may induce, when administered to a vertebrate, neutralizing antibodies in vivo. The modified or mutated RSV F proteins are favorably used for the prevention and/or treatment of RSV infection. Thus, another aspect of this disclosure concerns a method for eliciting an immune response against RSV. The method involves administering an immunologically effective amount of a composition containing a modified or mutated RSV F protein to a subject (such as a human or animal subject). Administration of an immunologically effective amount of the composition elicits an immune response specific for epitopes present on the modified or mutated RSV F protein. Such an immune response can include B cell responses (e.g., the production of neutralizing antibodies) and/or T cell responses (e.g., the production of cytokines). Preferably, the immune response elicited by the modified or mutated RSV F protein includes elements that are specific for at least one conformational epitope present on the modified or mutated RSV F protein. In one embodiment, the immune response is specific for an epitope present on an RSV F protein found in the “lollipop” post-fusion active state. The RSV F proteins and compositions can be administered to a subject without enhancing viral disease following contact with RSV. Preferably, the modified or mutated RSV F proteins disclosed herein and suitably formulated immunogenic compositions elicit a Th1 biased immune response that reduces or prevents infection with a RSV and/or reduces or prevents a pathological response following infection with a RSV. In one embodiment, the RSV F proteins of the present invention are found in the form of micelles (e.g. rosettes). The micelles obtainable in accordance with the invention consist of aggregates of the immunogenically active F spike proteins having a rosette-like structure. The rosettes are visible in the electron microscope (Calder et al., 2000, Virology 271: 122-131). Preferably, the micelles of the present invention comprising modified or mutated RSV F proteins exhibit the “lollipop” morphology indicative of the post-fusion active state. In one embodiment, the micelles are purified following expression in a host cell. When administered to a subject, the micelles of the present invention preferably induce neutralizing antibodies. In some embodiments, the micelles may be administered with an adjuvant. In other embodiments, the micelles may be administered without an adjuvant. In another embodiment, the invention encompasses RSV virus-like particles (VLPs) comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein that can be formulated into vaccines or antigenic formulations for protecting vertebrates (e.g. humans) against RSV infection or at least one disease symptom thereof. The present invention also relates to RSV VLPs and vectors comprising wild-type and mutated RSV genes or a combination thereof derived from different strains of RSV virus, which when transfected into host cells, will produce virus like particles (VLPs) comprising RSV proteins. In some embodiments, RSV virus-like particles may further comprise at least one viral matrix protein (e.g. an RSV M protein). In one embodiment, the M protein is derived from a human strain of RSV. In another embodiment, the M protein is derived from a bovine strain of RSV. In other embodiments, the matrix protein may be an M1 protein from a strain of influenza virus. In one embodiment, the strain of influenza virus is an avian influenza strain. In a preferred embodiment, the avian influenza strain is the H5N1 strain A/Indonesia/5/05. In other embodiments, the matrix protein may be from Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). In some embodiments, the VLPs may further comprise an RSV G protein. In one embodiment, the G protein may be from HRSV group A. In another embodiment, the G protein may be from HRSV group B. In yet another embodiment, the RSV G may be derived from HRSV group A and/or group B. In some embodiments, the VLPs may further comprise an RSV SH protein. In one embodiment, the SH protein may be from HRSV group A. In another embodiment, the SH protein may be from HRSV group B. In yet another embodiment, the RSV SH may be derived from HRSV group A and/or group B. In some embodiments, VLPs may further comprise an RSV N protein. In one embodiment, the N protein may be from HRSV group A. In another embodiment, the N protein may be from HRSV group B. In yet another embodiment, the RSV N may be derived from HRSV group A and/or group B. In further embodiments, VLPs of the invention may comprise one or more heterologous immunogens, such as influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA). In some embodiments, the invention also comprises combinations of different RSV M, F, N, SH, and/or G proteins from the same and/or different strains in one or more VLPs. In addition, the VLPs can include one or more additional molecules for the enhancement of an immune response. In another embodiment of the invention, the RSV VLPs can carry agents such as nucleic acids, siRNA, microRNA, chemotherapeutic agents, imaging agents, and/or other agents that need to be delivered to a patient. VLPs of the invention are useful for preparing vaccines and immunogenic compositions. One important feature of VLPs is the ability to express surface proteins of interest so that the immune system of a vertebrate induces an immune response against the protein of interest. However, not all proteins can be expressed on the surface of VLPs. There may be many reasons why certain proteins are not expressed, or are poorly expressed, on the surface of VLPs. One reason is that the protein is not directed to the membrane of a host cell or that the protein does not have a transmembrane domain. As an example, sequences near the carboxyl terminus of influenza hemagglutinin may be important for incorporation of HA into the lipid bilayer of the mature influenza enveloped nucleocapsids and for the assembly of HA trimer interaction with the influenza matrix protein M1 (Ali, et al., (2000) J. Virol. 74, 8709-19). Thus, one embodiment of the invention comprises chimeric VLPs comprising a modified or mutated F protein from RSV and at least one immunogen which is not normally efficiently expressed on the cell surface or is not a normal RSV protein. In one embodiment, the modified or mutated RSV F protein may be fused with an immunogen of interest. In another embodiment, the modified or mutated RSV F protein associates with the immunogen via the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of a heterologous viral surface membrane protein, e.g., MMTV envelope protein. Other chimeric VLPs of the invention comprise VLPs comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein and at least one protein from a heterologous infectious agent. Examples of heterologous infectious agents include but are not limited to a virus, a bacterium, a protozoan, a fungus and/or a parasite. In one embodiment, the immunogen from another infectious agent is a heterologous viral protein. In another embodiment, the protein from a heterologous infectious agent is an envelope-associated protein. In another embodiment, the protein from another heterologous infectious agent is expressed on the surface of VLPs. In another embodiment, the protein from an infectious agent comprises an epitope that will generate a protective immune response in a vertebrate. In one embodiment, the protein from another infectious agent is co-expressed with a modified or mutated RSV F protein. In another embodiment, the protein from another infectious agent is fused to a modified or mutated RSV F protein. In another embodiment, only a portion of a protein from another infectious agent is fused to a modified or mutated RSV F protein. In another embodiment, only a portion of a protein from another infectious agent is fused to a portion of a modified or mutated RSV F protein. In another embodiment, the portion of the protein from another infectious agent fused to modified or mutated RSV F protein is expressed on the surface of VLPs. The invention also encompasses variants of the proteins expressed on or in the VLPs of the invention. The variants may contain alterations in the amino acid sequences of the constituent proteins. The term “variant” with respect to a protein refers to an amino acid sequence that is altered by one or more amino acids with respect to a reference sequence. The variant can have “conservative” changes, wherein a substituted amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties, e.g., replacement of leucine with isoleucine. Alternatively, a variant can have “nonconservative” changes, e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan. Analogous minor variations can also include amino acid deletion or insertion, or both. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues can be substituted, inserted, or deleted without eliminating biological or immunological activity can be found using computer programs well known in the art, for example, DNASTAR software. Natural variants can occur due to mutations in the proteins. These mutations may lead to antigenic variability within individual groups of infectious agents, for example influenza. Thus, a person infected with, for example, an influenza strain develops antibody against that virus, as newer virus strains appear, the antibodies against the older strains no longer recognize the newer virus and re-infection can occur. The invention encompasses all antigenic and genetic variability of proteins from infectious agents for making VLPs. General texts which describe molecular biological techniques, which are applicable to the present invention, such as cloning, mutation, cell culture and the like, include Berger and Kimmel, Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, Methods in Enzymology volume 152 Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif. (Berger); Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual (3rd Ed.), Vol. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2000 (“Sambrook”) and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., Current Protocols, a joint venture between Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., (“Ausubel”). These texts describe mutagenesis, the use of vectors, promoters and many other relevant topics related to, e.g., the cloning and mutating F and/or G molecules of RSV, etc. Thus, the invention also encompasses using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology to improve or alter the characteristics of the proteins expressed on or in the VLPs of the invention. Various types of mutagenesis can be used to produce and/or isolate variant nucleic acids that encode for protein molecules and/or to further modify/mutate the proteins in or on the VLPs of the invention. They include but are not limited to site-directed, random point mutagenesis, homologous recombination (DNA shuffling), mutagenesis using uracil containing templates, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, phosphorothioate-modified DNA mutagenesis, mutagenesis using gapped duplex DNA or the like. Additional suitable methods include point mismatch repair, mutagenesis using repair-deficient host strains, restriction-selection and restriction-purification, deletion mutagenesis, mutagenesis by total gene synthesis, double-strand break repair, and the like. Mutagenesis, e.g., involving chimeric constructs, is also included in the present invention. In one embodiment, mutagenesis can be guided by known information of the naturally occurring molecule or altered or mutated naturally occurring molecule, e.g., sequence, sequence comparisons, physical properties, crystal structure or the like. The invention further comprises protein variants which show substantial biological activity, e.g., able to elicit an effective antibody response when expressed on or in VLPs of the invention. Such variants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and substitutions selected according to general rules known in the art so as have little effect on activity. Methods of cloning the proteins are known in the art. For example, the gene encoding a specific RSV protein can be isolated by RT-PCR from polyadenylated mRNA extracted from cells which had been infected with a RSV virus. The resulting product gene can be cloned as a DNA insert into a vector. The term “vector” refers to the means by which a nucleic acid can be propagated and/or transferred between organisms, cells, or cellular components. Vectors include plasmids, viruses, bacteriophages, pro-viruses, phagemids, transposons, artificial chromosomes, and the like, that replicate autonomously or can integrate into a chromosome of a host cell. A vector can also be a naked RNA polynucleotide, a naked DNA polynucleotide, a polynucleotide composed of both DNA and RNA within the same strand, a poly-lysine-conjugated DNA or RNA, a peptide-conjugated DNA or RNA, a liposome-conjugated DNA, or the like, that is not autonomously replicating. In many, but not all, common embodiments, the vectors of the present invention are plasmids or bacmids. Thus, the invention comprises nucleotides that encode proteins, including chimeric molecules, cloned into an expression vector that can be expressed in a cell that induces the formation of VLPs of the invention. An “expression vector” is a vector, such as a plasmid that is capable of promoting expression, as well as replication of a nucleic acid incorporated therein. Typically, the nucleic acid to be expressed is “operably linked” to a promoter and/or enhancer, and is subject to transcription regulatory control by the promoter and/or enhancer. In one embodiment, the nucleotides encode for a modified or mutated RSV F protein (as discussed above). In another embodiment, the vector further comprises nucleotides that encode the M and/or G RSV proteins. In another embodiment, the vector further comprises nucleotides that encode the M and/or N RSV proteins. In another embodiment, the vector further comprises nucleotides that encode the M, G and/or N RSV proteins. In another embodiment, the vector further comprises nucleotides that encode a BRSV M protein and/or N RSV proteins. In another embodiment, the vector further comprises nucleotides that encode a BRSV M and/or G protein, or influenza HA and/or NA protein. In another embodiment, the nucleotides encode a modified or mutated RSV F and/or RSV G protein with an influenza HA and/or NA protein. In another embodiment, the expression vector is a baculovirus vector. In some embodiments of the invention, proteins may comprise mutations containing alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or activities of the encoded protein or how the proteins are made. Nucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, e.g., to optimize codon expression for a particular host (change codons in the human mRNA to those preferred by insect cells such as Sf9 cells. See U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0118191, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. In addition, the nucleotides can be sequenced to ensure that the correct coding regions were cloned and do not contain any unwanted mutations. The nucleotides can be subcloned into an expression vector (e.g. baculovirus) for expression in any cell. The above is only one example of how the RSV viral proteins can be cloned. A person with skill in the art understands that additional methods are available and are possible. The invention also provides for constructs and/or vectors that comprise RSV nucleotides that encode for RSV structural genes, including F, M, G, N, SH, or portions thereof, and/or any chimeric molecule described above. The vector may be, for example, a phage, plasmid, viral, or retroviral vector. The constructs and/or vectors that comprise RSV structural genes, including F, M, G, N, SH, or portions thereof, and/or any chimeric molecule described above, should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, such as the AcMNPV polyhedrin promoter (or other baculovirus), phage lambda PL promoter, the E. coli lac, phoA and tac promoters, the SV40 early and late promoters, and promoters of retroviral LTRs are non-limiting examples. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan depending on the host cell and/or the rate of expression desired. The expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination, and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome-binding site for translation. The coding portion of the transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating codon at the beginning and a termination codon appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated. Expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase, G418 or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline, kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in E. coli and other bacteria. Among vectors preferred are virus vectors, such as baculovirus, poxvirus (e.g., vaccinia virus, avipox virus, canarypox virus, fowlpox virus, raccoonpox virus, swinepox virus, etc.), adenovirus (e.g., canine adenovirus), herpesvirus, and retrovirus. Other vectors that can be used with the invention comprise vectors for use in bacteria, which comprise pQE70, pQE60 and pQE-9, pBluescript vectors, Phagescript vectors, pNH8A, pNH16a, pNH18A, pNH46A, ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5. Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are pFastBac1 pWINEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1 and pSG, pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG, and pSVL. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan. In one embodiment, the vector that comprises nucleotides encoding for RSV genes, including modified or mutated RSV F genes, as well as genes for M, G, N, SH or portions thereof, and/or any chimeric molecule described above, is pFastBac. The recombinant constructs mentioned above could be used to transfect, infect, or transform and can express RSV proteins, including a modified or mutated RSV F protein and at least one immunogen. In one embodiment, the recombinant construct comprises a modified or mutated RSV F, M, G, N, SH, or portions thereof, and/or any molecule described above, into eukaryotic cells and/or prokaryotic cells. Thus, the invention provides for host cells which comprise a vector (or vectors) that contain nucleic acids which code for RSV structural genes, including a modified or mutated RSV F; and at least one immunogen such as but not limited to RSV G, N, and SH, or portions thereof, and/or any molecule described above, and permit the expression of genes, including RSV F, G, N, M, or SH or portions thereof, and/or any molecule described above in the host cell under conditions which allow the formation of VLPs. Among eukaryotic host cells are yeast, insect, avian, plant, C. elegans (or nematode) and mammalian host cells. Non limiting examples of insect cells are, Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) cells, e.g. 5f9, Sf21, Trichoplusia ni cells, e.g. High Five cells, and Drosophila S2 cells. Examples of fungi (including yeast) host cells are S. cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis (K. lactis), species of Candida including C. albicans and C. glabrata, Aspergillus nidulans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe), Pichia pastoris, and Yarrowia lipolytica. Examples of mammalian cells are COS cells, baby hamster kidney cells, mouse L cells, LNCaP cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, and African green monkey cells, CV1 cells, HeLa cells, MDCK cells, Vero and Hep-2 cells. Xenopus laevis oocytes, or other cells of amphibian origin, may also be used. Examples of prokaryotic host cells include bacterial cells, for example, E. coli, B. subtilis, Salmonella typhi and mycobacteria. Vectors, e.g., vectors comprising polynucleotides of a modified or mutated RSV F protein; and at least one immunogen including but not limited to RSV G, N, or SH or portions thereof, and/or any chimeric molecule described above, can be transfected into host cells according to methods well known in the art. For example, introducing nucleic acids into eukaryotic cells can be by calcium phosphate co-precipitation, electroporation, microinjection, lipofection, and transfection employing polyamine transfection reagents. In one embodiment, the vector is a recombinant baculovirus. In another embodiment, the recombinant baculovirus is transfected into a eukaryotic cell. In a preferred embodiment, the cell is an insect cell. In another embodiment, the insect cell is a Sf9 cell. This invention also provides for constructs and methods that will increase the efficiency of VLP production. For example, the addition of leader sequences to the RSV F, M, G, N, SH, or portions thereof, and/or any chimeric or heterologous molecules described above, can improve the efficiency of protein transporting within the cell. For example, a heterologous signal sequence can be fused to the F, M, G, N, SH, or portions thereof, and/or any chimeric or heterologous molecule described above. In one embodiment, the signal sequence can be derived from the gene of an insect cell and fused to M, F, G, N, SH, or portions thereof, and/or any chimeric or heterologous molecules described above. In another embodiment, the signal peptide is the chitinase signal sequence, which works efficiently in baculovirus expression systems. Another method to increase efficiency of VLP production is to codon optimize the nucleotides that encode RSV including a modified or mutated RSV F protein, M, G, N, SH or portions thereof, and/or any chimeric or heterologous molecules described above for a specific cell type. For examples of codon optimizing nucleic acids for expression in Sf9 cell see SEQ ID Nos: 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 19, and 25. The invention also provides for methods of producing VLPs, the methods comprising expressing RSV genes including a modified or mutated RSV F protein, and at least one additional protein, including but not limited to RSV M, G, N, SH, or portions thereof, and/or any chimeric or heterologous molecules described above under conditions that allow VLP formation. Depending on the expression system and host cell selected, the VLPs are produced by growing host cells transformed by an expression vector under conditions whereby the recombinant proteins are expressed and VLPs are formed. In one embodiment, the invention comprises a method of producing a VLP, comprising transfecting vectors encoding at least one modified or mutated RSV F protein into a suitable host cell and expressing the modified or mutated RSV F protein under conditions that allow VLP formation. In another embodiment, the eukaryotic cell is selected from the group consisting of, yeast, insect, amphibian, avian or mammalian cells. The selection of the appropriate growth conditions is within the skill or a person with skill of one of ordinary skill in the art. Methods to grow cells engineered to produce VLPs of the invention include, but are not limited to, batch, batch-fed, continuous and perfusion cell culture techniques. Cell culture means the growth and propagation of cells in a bioreactor (a fermentation chamber) where cells propagate and express protein (e.g. recombinant proteins) for purification and isolation. Typically, cell culture is performed under sterile, controlled temperature and atmospheric conditions in a bioreactor. A bioreactor is a chamber used to culture cells in which environmental conditions such as temperature, atmosphere, agitation and/or pH can be monitored. In one embodiment, the bioreactor is a stainless steel chamber. In another embodiment, the bioreactor is a pre-sterilized plastic bag (e.g. Cellbag®, Wave Biotech, Bridgewater, N.J.). In other embodiment, the pre-sterilized plastic bags are about 50 L to 1000 L bags. The VLPs are then isolated using methods that preserve the integrity thereof, such as by gradient centrifugation, e.g., cesium chloride, sucrose and iodixanol, as well as standard purification techniques including, e.g., ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The following is an example of how VLPs of the invention can be made, isolated and purified. Usually VLPs are produced from recombinant cell lines engineered to create VLPs when the cells are grown in cell culture (see above). A person of skill in the art would understand that there are additional methods that can be utilized to make and purify VLPs of the invention, thus the invention is not limited to the method described. Production of VLPs of the invention can start by seeding Sf9 cells (non-infected) into shaker flasks, allowing the cells to expand and scaling up as the cells grow and multiply (for example from a 125-ml flask to a 50 L Wave bag). The medium used to grow the cell is formulated for the appropriate cell line (preferably serum free media, e.g. insect medium ExCell-420, JRH). Next, the cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus at the most efficient multiplicity of infection (e.g. from about 1 to about 3 plaque forming units per cell). Once infection has occurred, the modified or mutated RSV F protein, M, G, N, SH, or portions thereof, and/or any chimeric or heterologous molecule described above, are expressed from the virus genome, self assemble into VLPs and are secreted from the cells approximately 24 to 72 hours post infection. Usually, infection is most efficient when the cells are in mid-log phase of growth (4-8×106 cells/ml) and are at least about 90% viable. VLPs of the invention can be harvested approximately 48 to 96 hours post infection, when the levels of VLPs in the cell culture medium are near the maximum but before extensive cell lysis. The Sf9 cell density and viability at the time of harvest can be about 0.5×106 cells/ml to about 1.5×106 cells/ml with at least 20% viability, as shown by dye exclusion assay. Next, the medium is removed and clarified. NaCl can be added to the medium to a concentration of about 0.4 to about 1.0 M, preferably to about 0.5 M, to avoid VLP aggregation. The removal of cell and cellular debris from the cell culture medium containing VLPs of the invention can be accomplished by tangential flow filtration (TFF) with a single use, pre-sterilized hollow fiber 0.5 or 1.00 μm filter cartridge or a similar device. Next, VLPs in the clarified culture medium can be concentrated by ultra-filtration using a disposable, pre-sterilized 500,000 molecular weight cut off hollow fiber cartridge. The concentrated VLPs can be diafiltrated against 10 volumes pH 7.0 to 8.0 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5 M NaCl to remove residual medium components. The concentrated, diafiltered VLPs can be furthered purified on a 20% to 60% discontinuous sucrose gradient in pH 7.2 PBS buffer with 0.5 M NaCl by centrifugation at 6,500×g for 18 hours at about 4° C. to about 10° C. Usually VLPs will form a distinctive visible band between about 30% to about 40% sucrose or at the interface (in a 20% and 60% step gradient) that can be collected from the gradient and stored. This product can be diluted to comprise 200 mM of NaCl in preparation for the next step in the purification process. This product contains VLPs and may contain intact baculovirus particles. Further purification of VLPs can be achieved by anion exchange chromatography, or 44% isopycnic sucrose cushion centrifugation. In anion exchange chromatography, the sample from the sucrose gradient (see above) is loaded into column containing a medium with an anion (e.g. Matrix Fractogel EMD TMAE) and eluded via a salt gradient (from about 0.2 M to about 1.0 M of NaCl) that can separate the VLP from other contaminates (e.g. baculovirus and DNA/RNA). In the sucrose cushion method, the sample comprising the VLPs is added to a 44% sucrose cushion and centrifuged for about 18 hours at 30,000 g. VLPs form a band at the top of 44% sucrose, while baculovirus precipitates at the bottom and other contaminating proteins stay in the 0% sucrose layer at the top. The VLP peak or band is collected. The intact baculovirus can be inactivated, if desired. Inactivation can be accomplished by chemical methods, for example, formalin or β-propiolactone (BPL). Removal and/or inactivation of intact baculovirus can also be largely accomplished by using selective precipitation and chromatographic methods known in the art, as exemplified above. Methods of inactivation comprise incubating the sample containing the VLPs in 0.2% of BPL for 3 hours at about 25° C. to about 27° C. The baculovirus can also be inactivated by incubating the sample containing the VLPs at 0.05% BPL at 4° C. for 3 days, then at 37° C. for one hour. After the inactivation/removal step, the product comprising VLPs can be run through another diafiltration step to remove any reagent from the inactivation step and/or any residual sucrose, and to place the VLPs into the desired buffer (e.g. PBS). The solution comprising VLPs can be sterilized by methods known in the art (e.g. sterile filtration) and stored in the refrigerator or freezer. The above techniques can be practiced across a variety of scales. For example, T-flasks, shake-flasks, spinner bottles, up to industrial sized bioreactors. The bioreactors can comprise either a stainless steel tank or a pre-sterilized plastic bag (for example, the system sold by Wave Biotech, Bridgewater, N.J.). A person with skill in the art will know what is most desirable for their purposes. Expansion and production of baculovirus expression vectors and infection of cells with recombinant baculovirus to produce recombinant RSV VLPs can be accomplished in insect cells, for example Sf9 insect cells as previously described. In one embodiment, the cells are SF9 infected with recombinant baculovirus engineered to produce RSV VLPs.

Alternatively, the vaccine formulation is administered intranasally, either by drops, large particle aerosol (greater than about 10 microns), or spray into the upper respiratory tract. While any of the above routes of delivery results in an immune response, intranasal administration confers the added benefit of eliciting mucosal immunity at the site of entry of many viruses, including RSV and influenza. Thus, the invention also comprises a method of formulating a vaccine or antigenic composition that induces immunity to an infection or at least one disease symptom thereof to a mammal, comprising adding to the formulation an effective dose of a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein. In one embodiment, the infection is an RSV infection. While stimulation of immunity with a single dose is possible, additional dosages can be administered, by the same or different route, to achieve the desired effect. In neonates and infants, for example, multiple administrations may be required to elicit sufficient levels of immunity. Administration can continue at intervals throughout childhood, as necessary to maintain sufficient levels of protection against infections, e.g. RSV infection. Similarly, adults who are particularly susceptible to repeated or serious infections, such as, for example, health care workers, day care workers, family members of young children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised cardiopulmonary function may require multiple immunizations to establish and/or maintain protective immune responses. Levels of induced immunity can be monitored, for example, by measuring amounts of neutralizing secretory and serum antibodies, and dosages adjusted or vaccinations repeated as necessary to elicit and maintain desired levels of protection. Methods of administering a composition comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein (e.g. vaccine and/or antigenic formulations) include, but are not limited to, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous and subcutaneous), epidural, and mucosal (e.g., intranasal and oral or pulmonary routes or by suppositories). In a specific embodiment, compositions of the present invention are administered intramuscularly, intravenously, subcutaneously, transdermally or intradermally. The compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucous, colon, conjunctiva, nasopharynx, oropharynx, vagina, urethra, urinary bladder and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. In some embodiments, intranasal or other mucosal routes of administration of a composition of the invention may induce an antibody or other immune response that is substantially higher than other routes of administration. In another embodiment, intranasal or other mucosal routes of administration of a composition of the invention may induce an antibody or other immune response that will induce cross protection against other strains of RSV. Administration can be systemic or local. In yet another embodiment, the vaccine and/or immunogenic formulation is administered in such a manner as to target mucosal tissues in order to elicit an immune response at the site of immunization. For example, mucosal tissues such as gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) can be targeted for immunization by using oral administration of compositions which contain adjuvants with particular mucosal targeting properties. Additional mucosal tissues can also be targeted, such as nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue (NALT) and bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). Vaccines and/or immunogenic formulations of the invention may also be administered on a dosage schedule, for example, an initial administration of the vaccine composition with subsequent booster administrations. In particular embodiments, a second dose of the composition is administered anywhere from two weeks to one year, preferably from about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5 to about 6 months, after the initial administration. Additionally, a third dose may be administered after the second dose and from about three months to about two years, or even longer, preferably about 4, about 5, or about 6 months, or about 7 months to about one year after the initial administration. The third dose may be optionally administered when no or low levels of specific immunoglobulins are detected in the serum and/or urine or mucosal secretions of the subject after the second dose. In a preferred embodiment, a second dose is administered about one month after the first administration and a third dose is administered about six months after the first administration. In another embodiment, the second dose is administered about six months after the first administration. In another embodiment, the compositions of the invention can be administered as part of a combination therapy. For example, compositions of the invention can be formulated with other immunogenic compositions, antivirals and/or antibiotics. The dosage of the pharmaceutical composition can be determined readily by the skilled artisan, for example, by first identifying doses effective to elicit a prophylactic or therapeutic immune response, e.g., by measuring the serum titer of virus specific immunoglobulins or by measuring the inhibitory ratio of antibodies in serum samples, or urine samples, or mucosal secretions. The dosages can be determined from animal studies. A non-limiting list of animals used to study the efficacy of vaccines include the guinea pig, hamster, ferrets, chinchilla, mouse and cotton rat. Most animals are not natural hosts to infectious agents but can still serve in studies of various aspects of the disease. For example, any of the above animals can be dosed with a vaccine candidate, e.g. modified or mutated RSV F proteins, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or VLPs of the invention, to partially characterize the immune response induced, and/or to determine if any neutralizing antibodies have been produced. For example, many studies have been conducted in the mouse model because mice are small size and their low cost allows researchers to conduct studies on a larger scale. In addition, human clinical studies can be performed to determine the preferred effective dose for humans by a skilled artisan. Such clinical studies are routine and well known in the art. The precise dose to be employed will also depend on the route of administration. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal test systems. As also well known in the art, the immunogenicity of a particular composition can be enhanced by the use of non-specific stimulators of the immune response, known as adjuvants. Adjuvants have been used experimentally to promote a generalized increase in immunity against unknown antigens (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,611) Immunization protocols have used adjuvants to stimulate responses for many years, and as such, adjuvants are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Some adjuvants affect the way in which antigens are presented. For example, the immune response is increased when protein antigens are precipitated by alum. Emulsification of antigens also prolongs the duration of antigen presentation. The inclusion of any adjuvant described in Vogel et al., “A Compendium of Vaccine Adjuvants and Excipients (2nd Edition),” herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, is envisioned within the scope of this invention. Exemplary, adjuvants include complete Freund's adjuvant (a non-specific stimulator of the immune response containing killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis), incomplete Freund's adjuvants and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Other adjuvants comprise GMCSP, BCG, aluminum hydroxide, MDP compounds, such as thur-MDP and nor-MDP, CGP (MTP-PE), lipid A, and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). RIBI, which contains three components extracted from bacteria, MPL, trehalose dimycolate (TDM) and cell wall skeleton (CWS) in a 2% squalene/Tween 80 emulsion also is contemplated. MF-59, Novasomes®, MHC antigens may also be used. In one embodiment of the invention the adjuvant is a paucilamellar lipid vesicle having about two to ten bilayers arranged in the form of substantially spherical shells separated by aqueous layers surrounding a large amorphous central cavity free of lipid bilayers. Paucilamellar lipid vesicles may act to stimulate the immune response several ways, as non-specific stimulators, as carriers for the antigen, as carriers of additional adjuvants, and combinations thereof. Paucilamellar lipid vesicles act as non-specific immune stimulators when, for example, a vaccine is prepared by intermixing the antigen with the preformed vesicles such that the antigen remains extracellular to the vesicles. By encapsulating an antigen within the central cavity of the vesicle, the vesicle acts both as an immune stimulator and a carrier for the antigen. In another embodiment, the vesicles are primarily made of nonphospholipid vesicles. In other embodiments, the vesicles are Novasomes®. Novasomes® are paucilamellar nonphospholipid vesicles ranging from about 100 nm to about 500 nm. They comprise Brij 72, cholesterol, oleic acid and squalene. Novasomes have been shown to be an effective adjuvant for influenza antigens (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,629,021, 6,387,373, and 4,911,928, herein incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes). The compositions of the invention can also be formulated with “immune stimulators.” These are the body's own chemical messengers (cytokines) to increase the immune system's response Immune stimulators include, but are not limited to, various cytokines, lymphokines and chemokines with immunostimulatory, immunopotentiating, and pro-inflammatory activities, such as interleukins (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13); growth factors (e.g., granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-colony stimulating factor (CSF)); and other immunostimulatory molecules, such as macrophage inflammatory factor, Flt3 ligand, B7.1; B7.2, etc. The immunostimulatory molecules can be administered in the same formulation as the compositions of the invention, or can be administered separately. Either the protein or an expression vector encoding the protein can be administered to produce an immunostimulatory effect. Thus in one embodiment, the invention comprises antigentic and vaccine formulations comprising an adjuvant and/or an immune stimulator. Methods of Stimulating an Immune Response The modified or mutated RSV F proteins, the RSV F micelles comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or the VLPs of the invention are useful for preparing compositions that stimulate an immune response that confers immunity or substantial immunity to infectious agents. Both mucosal and cellular immunity may contribute to immunity to infectious agents and disease. Antibodies secreted locally in the upper respiratory tract are a major factor in resistance to natural infection. Secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) is involved in the protection of the upper respiratory tract and serum IgG in protection of the lower respiratory tract. The immune response induced by an infection protects against reinfection with the same virus or an antigenically similar viral strain. For example, RSV undergoes frequent and unpredictable changes; therefore, after natural infection, the effective period of protection provided by the host's immunity may only be effective for a few years against the new strains of virus circulating in the community. Thus, the invention encompasses a method of inducing immunity to infections or at least one disease symptom thereof in a subject, comprising administering at least one effective dose of a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein.

In another embodiment, the method comprises administering VLPs comprising M protein from BRSV and a chimeric RSV F and/or G protein and optionally HA or NA protein derived from an influenza virus, wherein the HA or NA protein is fused to the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of RSV F and/or G protein.

These VLPs contain BRSV M (including chimeric M), RSV F, G, and/or N proteins and may contain additional cellular constituents such as cellular proteins, baculovirus proteins, lipids, carbohydrates etc., but do not contain additional RSV proteins (other than fragments of BRSV M (including chimeric M), BRSV/RSV F, G, and/or N proteins. In another embodiment, the subject is a vertebrate. In one embodiment the vertebrate is a mammal. In another embodiment, the mammal is a human. In another embodiment, the method comprises inducing immunity to RSV infection or at least one disease symptom by administering the formulation in one dose. In another embodiment, the method comprises inducing immunity to RSV infection or at least one disease symptom by administering the formulation in multiple doses. The composition may be administered in a suitable protein dosage range.

As used throughout the disclosure, the term “about” means±10% of the indicated value. The invention also encompasses inducing immunity to an infection, or at least one symptom thereof, in a subject caused by an infectious agent, comprising administering at least one effective dose of a modified or mutated RSV F protein, an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein, or a VLP comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein.

Compositions of the invention can induce substantial immunity in a vertebrate (e.g. a human) when administered to the vertebrate. The substantial immunity results from an immune response against compositions of the invention that protects or ameliorates infection or at least reduces a symptom of infection in the vertebrate. In some instances, if the vertebrate is infected, the infection will be asymptomatic. The response may not be a fully protective response.

As used herein, an “antibody” is a protein comprising one or more polypeptides substantially or partially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. A typical immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” (about 25 kD) and one “heavy” chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. Antibodies exist as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. In one embodiment, the invention comprises a method of inducing a protective cellular response to RSV infection or at least one disease symptom in a subject, comprising administering at least one effective dose of a modified or mutated RSV F protein. In another embodiment, the invention comprises a method of inducing a protective cellular response to RSV infection or at least one disease symptom in a subject, comprising administering at least one effective dose an RSV F micelle comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein. In yet another embodiment, the invention comprises a method of inducing a protective cellular response to RSV infection or at least one disease symptom in a subject, comprising administering at least one effective dose a VLP, wherein the VLP comprises a modified or mutated RSV F protein as described above. Cell-mediated immunity also plays a role in recovery from RSV infection and may prevent RSV-associated complications. RSV-specific cellular lymphocytes have been detected in the blood and the lower respiratory tract secretions of infected subjects. Cytolysis of RSV-infected cells is mediated by CTLs in concert with RSV-specific antibodies and complement. The primary cytotoxic response is detectable in blood after 6-14 days and disappears by day 21 in infected or vaccinated individuals (Ennis et al., 1981). Cell-mediated immunity may also play a role in recovery from RSV infection and may prevent RSV-associated complications. RSV-specific cellular lymphocytes have been detected in the blood and the lower respiratory tract secretions of infected subjects. As mentioned above, the immunogenic compositions of the invention prevent or reduce at least one symptom of RSV infection in a subject. Symptoms of RSV are well known in the art. They include rhinorrhea, sore throat, headache, hoarseness, cough, sputum, fever, rales, wheezing, and dyspnea. Thus, the method of the invention comprises the prevention or reduction of at least one symptom associated with RSV infection. A reduction in a symptom may be determined subjectively or objectively, e.g., self assessment by a subject, by a clinician's assessment or by conducting an appropriate assay or measurement (e.g. body temperature), including, e.g., a quality of life assessment, a slowed progression of a RSV infection or additional symptoms, a reduced severity of a RSV symptoms or a suitable assays (e.g. antibody titer and/or T-cell activation assay). The objective assessment comprises both animal and human assessments. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples that should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the Figures and the Sequence Listing, are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. EXAMPLES Example 1 Generating Recombinant Bacmids, Transfection of Insect Cells to Make Recombinant Virus Stocks, Plaque Purification, and Infecting Insect Cells with Primary Virus Stock To construct recombinant virus, the viral genes of interest were codon optimized for Sf9 insect cells expression and cloned into pFastBac™ vectors. Once the desired constructs were identified and purified, one vial of MAX Efficiency® DH10Bac™ competent cells for each construct was thawed on ice. Approximately 1 ng (5 μl) of the desired pFastBac™ construct plasmid DNA was added to the cells and mixed gently. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 minutes. This was followed by heat-shock of the cells for 45 seconds at 42° C. without shaking. Next, the tubes were transferred to ice and chilled for 2 minutes. Subsequently 900 μl of room temperature S.O.C. Medium was added to each tube. The tubes were put on a shaker at 37° C. at 225 rpm for 4 hours. For each pFastBac™ transformation, 10-fold serial dilutions of the cells (10-1, 10-2 and 10-3) were prepared using S.O.C. medium. Next, 100 μl of each dilution was plated on an LB agar plate containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 7 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline, 100 μg/ml Bluo-gal, and 40 μg/ml IPTG. The plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37° C. White colonies were picked for analysis. Different bacmid DNAs from above were made for each construct and were isolated. These DNAs were precipitated and added to Sf9 cells for 5 hours. Next, 30 ml of Sf9 insect cells (2×106 cells/ml) were infected with baculovirus expressing viral proteins of interest with 0.3 ml of plaque eluate and incubated 48-72 hrs. Approximately 1 ml of crude culture (cells+medium) and clarified culture harvests were saved for expression analysis and the rest were saved for purification purposes. Example 2 Expression, Purification, and Analysis of Modified HRSV F Proteins Genes encoding modified HRSV F proteins of interest were synthesized in vitro as overlapping oligonucleotides, cloned and expressed in host cells. Cloning and expression of the modified RSV F genes were achieved following the methods known in the art. Recombinant plaques containing viral proteins of interest were picked and confirmed. The recombinant virus was then amplified by infection of Sf9 insect cells. In some cases, Sf9 insect cells were co-infected by a recombinant virus expressing modified F protein and another recombinant virus expressing other viral proteins (e.g., BRSV M protein and/or HRSV N protein). A culture of insect cells was infected at ˜3 MOI (Multiplicity of infection=virus ffu or pfu/cell) with baculovirus carrying the various constructs. The culture and supernatant were harvested 48-72 hours post-infection. The crude harvest, approximately 30 mL, was clarified by centrifugation for 15 minutes at approximately 800×g. The resulting crude cell harvests containing modified HRSV F protein were purified as described below. Modified HRSV F proteins of interest were purified from the infected Sf9 insect cell culture harvests. Non-ionic surfactant Tergitol® NP-9 (Nonylphenol Ethoxylate) was used in a membrane protein extraction protocol. Crude extraction was further purified by passing through anion exchange chromatography, lentil lectin affinity/HIC, and cation exchange chromatography. Protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained for total proteins by coomassie stain. Equal volumes of cell samples from crude harvest and 2× sample buffer containing βME (beta-mercaptoehtanol) were loaded, approximately 15 to 20 μl (about to 7.5 to 10 μl of the culture)/lane, onto an SDS Laemmli gel. In some cases, instead of chromatography, modified HRSV F proteins in the crude cell harvests were concentrated by 30% sucrose gradient separation method, and then were analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with coomassie, or Western Blot using anti-RSV F monoclonal antibody. Crude cell harvest containing modified recombinant F proteins, purified recombinant F proteins, or recombinant F proteins concentrated by sucrose gradient can be further analyzed by Western Blot using anti-RSV F monoclonal antibody and/or anti-RSV F polyclonal antibody. Example 3 Modified HRSV F Gene Encoding F Protein BV #541 Initial attempts to express the full length HRSV F protein proved unsuccessful in achieving high levels of expression. The F gene sequence used in the expression was SEQ ID NO: 1 (wild type HRSV F gene, GenBank Accession No. M11486). It encodes an inactive precursor (F0) of 574 aa. This precursor is cleaved twice by furin-like proteases during maturation to yield two disulfide-linked polypeptides, subunit F2 from the N terminus and F1 from the C terminus (FIG. 1). The two cleavages sites are at residues 109 and 136, which are preceded by furin-recognition motifs (RARR, aa 106-109 (SEQ ID NO: 23) and KKRKRR, aa 131-136 (SEQ ID NO: 24)). The F gene sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 contains suboptimal codon usage for expression in Sf9 insect cells and harbors 3 errors, producing a protein that can exhibit less than optimal folding (SEQ ID NO: 2, GenBank Accession No. AAB59858). In addition, a possible Poly (A) adenylation site (ATAAAA) was identified at the region encoding the F2 subunit. Moreover, the wild type F gene sequence is approximately 65% AT rich, while desired GC-AT ratio of a gene sequence in Sf9 insect cell expression system is approximately 1:1. In attempt to overcome poor expression levels of HRSV F protein, a new F gene sequence was designed so that: (a) the three GenBank sequencing errors were corrected; (b) the cryptic poly (A) site at the region encoding F2 subunit was modified; (c) F gene codons were optimized; and (d) the F gene encodes a modified F protein with inactivated primary cleavage site. The three corrected amino acids errors were P102A, I379V, and M447V. The cryptic poly (A) site in the HRSV F gene was corrected without changing the amino acid sequence. The codon optimization scheme was based on the following criteria: (1) abundance of aminoacyl-tRNAs for a particular codon in Lepidopteran species of insect cells for a given amino acid as described by Levin, D. B. et al. (Journal of General Virology, 2000, vol. 81, pp. 2313-2325), (2) maintenance of GC-AT ratio in gene sequences at approximately 1:1, (3) minimal introduction of palindromic or stem-loop DNA structures, and (4) minimal introduction of transcription and post-transcription repressor element sequences. An example of optimized F gene sequence was shown as SEQ ID NO: 19 (RSV-F BV #368). To inactivate the primary cleavage site (1° CS, KKRKRR, aa 131-136) of HRSV F protein, the furin recognition site was mutated to either KKQKQQ (SEQ ID NO: 28) or GRRQQR (SEQ ID NO: 29). Several modified F proteins with such cleavage site mutations were evaluated to determine the efficiency of cleavage prevention. FIG. 2 shows several of the modified F proteins that were evaluated. The results indicate that the primary cleavage site of HRSV F protein can be inactivated by three conservative amino acid changes R133Q, R135Q, and R136Q. These conservative amino acid changes from Arginine (R) which is a polar-charged molecule, to Glutamine (Q) which is a polar-neutral molecule, altered the charge status at these sites and prevented cleavage by furin-like proteases (see FIG. 3), while still preserving the F protein 3D structure. Prevention of cleavage at 1° CS resulted in reduced membrane fusion activity of the F protein. A non-limiting exemplary modified HRSV F gene sequence designed to have all modifications mentioned above is shown in FIG. 4. This modified F gene (SEQ ID NO: 5, RSV-F BV #541) encodes a modified F protein of SEQ ID NO: 6. The gene sequence was synthesized in vitro as overlapping oligonucleotides, cloned and expressed in host cells. Modified HRSV F protein BV #541 was purified from the infected Sf9 insect cell culture harvests, and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained by coomassie. The method of purification and SDS-PAGE analysis is described in Example 2. The expression level of the F protein RSV-F BV #541 (e.g. F protein 541) was improved as compared to the wild type F0 protein in Sf9 insect cells. Example 4 Modified HRSV F Protein with F1 Subunit Fusion Domain Partial Deletion To further improve expression of the RSV F protein, additional modified HRSV F genes were designed that comprised the following modifications: (a) the three GenBank sequencing errors were corrected; (b) the cryptic poly (A) site at the region encoding F2 subunit was modified; (c) F gene codons were optimized; and (d) the nucleotide sequences encoding the F1 subunit fusion domain was partially deleted. In one experiment, the nucleotide sequence encoding the first 10 amino acids of the F1 subunit fusion domain was deleted (corresponding to amino acids 137-146 of SEQ ID NO: 2). A non-limiting exemplary modified RSV F gene comprising said modifications is shown in FIG. 5, designated as SEQ ID NO: 9 (RSV-F BV #622, e.g. F protein 622), encoding a modified F protein of SEQ ID NO: 10. The modified HRSV F protein BV #622 was purified from the infected Sf9 insect cell culture harvests, and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with coomassie. The method of purification and SDS-PAGE analysis is described in Example 2. High expression levels of HRSV F protein BV #622 were observed, as displayed in the SDS-PAGE in FIG. 6. Example 5 Modified HRSV F Protein with Both Inactivated Primary Cleavage Site and F1 Fusion Domain Partial Deletion To determine if the combination of inactivated primary cleavage site and F1 fusion domain partial deletion can further promote expression of the RSV F protein, particularly in the Sf9 insect cells, another modified RSV F gene was designed comprising following modifications: (a) the three GenBank sequencing errors were corrected; (b) the cryptic poly (A) site at the region encoding F2 subunit was modified; (c) F gene codons were optimized; (d) the primary cleavage site was inactivated; and (e) the nucleotide sequence encoding the F1 subunit fusion domain was partially deleted. In one experiment, the nucleotide sequence encoding the first 10 amino acids of the F1 subunit fusion domain was deleted (corresponding to amino acids 137-146 of SEQ ID NO: 2). A non-limiting exemplary modified RSV F gene in which the first 10 amino acids of the F1 subunit fusion domain were deleted (corresponding to amino acids 137-146 of SEQ ID NO: 2) is shown in FIG. 7A, designated as SEQ ID NO: 7 (RSV-F BV #683, e.g. F protein 683), encoding the modified F protein of SEQ ID NO: 8. The modified RSV F protein BV #683 (e.g. F protein 683) was purified from the infected Sf9 insect cell culture harvests and analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with coomassie. The method of purification and SDS-PAGE analysis is described in Example 2. Further enhancements in the of expression levels were achieved, as displayed in the SDS-PAGE in FIG. 8. An non-limiting exemplary modified RSV F gene comprising said in which the first 10 amino acids of the F1 subunit fusion domain were deleted (corresponding to amino acids 137-146 of SEQ ID NO: 2) is shown in FIG. 7A, designated as SEQ ID NO: 7 (RSV-F BV #683, e.g. F protein 683), encoding the modified F protein of SEQ ID NO: 8. The modified RSV F protein BV #683 (e.g. F protein 683) was purified from the infected Sf9 insect cell culture harvests and analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with coomassie. The method of purification and SDS-PAGE analysis is described in Example 2. Further enhancements in the of expression levels were achieved, as displayed in the SDS-PAGE in FIG. 8. Alternate Example 5 Modified HRSV F Protein Fusion Domain Deletions Deletions in the F1 fusion domain of 42, 44, 46, 48, MO, 412, 414, 416 or 418 amino acids from Phe137-Val154 were introduced into clone #541 (FIG. 7A). Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus expressing these deletion mutants were analyzed for RSV F protein extracted from infected cells with a non-ionic detergent (FIG. 7B) and by FACS analysis of cells stained for RSV F (FIG. 7C). Deletions of up to 10 amino acids Phe137-Ser146 (FIG. 7A Δ2, Δ4, Δ6, Δ8 and Δ10) increased the level of soluble F1 extracted from the cells relative to the parent clone BV#541 (FIG. 7B). A dramatic loss in soluble RSV F was observed with increasing deletions of the fusion domain greater than 10 amino acids, likely due to mis-folding of the molecule. Consistent with these results, constructs with Δ2, Δ6 and Δ10 amino acid deletions of the F1 fusion peptide displayed the highest cell surface expression of RSV F (FIG. 7C). Example 6 Expression and Purification of Modified HRSV F Protein BV #683 Modified HRSV F protein BV #683 (e.g. F protein 683, SEQ ID NO: 8) was expressed in baculovirus expression system as described in Example 1, and recombinant plaques expressing HRSV F protein BV #683 were picked and confirmed. The recombinant virus was then amplified by infection of Sf9 insect cells. A culture of insect cells was infected at ˜3 MOI (Multiplicity of infection=virus ffu or pfu/cell) with baculovirus. The culture and supernatant were harvested 48-72 hrs post-infection. The crude harvest, approximately 30 mL, was clarified by centrifugation for 15 minutes at approximately 800×g. The resulting crude cell harvests containing HRSV F protein BV #683 were purified as described below. HRSV F protein BV #683 was purified from the infected Sf9 insect cell culture harvests. Non-ionic surfactant Tergitol® NP-9 (Nonylphenol Ethoxylate) was used to in a membrane protein extraction protocol. Crude extraction was further purified by passing through anion exchange chromatography, lentil lectin affinity/HIC and cation exchange chromatography. Purified HRSV F protein BV #683 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with coomassie, and Western Blot using anti-RSV F monoclonal antibody as described in Example 2. The results were shown in FIG. 9. Excellent expression levels of the HRSV F protein BV #683 (e.g. F protein 683, SEQ ID NO: 8) were achieved. It was estimated that the expression level was above 10 mg/L in crude cell culture, and recovered F protein BV #683 was about 3.5 mg/L cell culture. In some cases expression levels above 20 mg/L were achieved and about 5 mg/L modified F protein BV #683 was recovered (see FIG. 10). Purity of the recovered F protein BV #683 reached above 98% as determined by scanning densitometry (see FIG. 10). Example 7 Purified HRSV F Protein BV #683 Micelles (Rosettes) Purified HRSV F protein BV #683 was analyzed by negative stain electron microscopy (see FIG. 11). F proteins aggregated in the form of micelles (rosettes), similar to those observed for wild type HRSV F protein (Calder et al., 2000, Virology 271, pp. 122-131), and other full-length virus membrane glycoproteins (Wrigley et al., Academic Press, London, 1986, vol. 5, pp. 103-163). Under electron microscopy, the F spikes exhibited lollipop-shaped rod morphology with their wider ends projecting away from the centers of the rosettes (FIG. 11). Alternate Example 7 HPLC Analysis of of Purified HRSV F Protein BV #683 Micelles (Rosettes) Purified HRSV F protein BV #683 was analyzed by HPLC. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis showed purified RSV F micelles consisting of 90.1% F1+F2 at retention time of 11.195 min and 9.9% F1 polypeptide at retention time of 6.256 min (FIG. 12A). The F1+F2 peak at 11.195 min showed a double peak, suggesting different glycosylation species. The identity of F1+F2 and F1 were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of isolated HPLC peak fractions. Intact mass determination by mass spectrometry showed that F1 and F1+F2 had molecular weights of 50KDa and 61Kda, respectively, similar to the predicted molecular weights. Purified RSV F nanoparticles were further analyzed using HPLC size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The RSV F nanoparticles consisted primarily of covalently linked F1 and F2 (FIG. 12B; F1+F2) with a low level of free F1 subunits. F1+F2 was 95.8% of the total peak area, and F1 was 3.8% of the total peak area. The purity of RSV F particles was estimated to be >98%. The F1+F2 peak was eluted in the void volume of this SEC column and the F1 peak had a mass of about 180Kda, as expected for F1 trimers. An analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) study showed that the majority of species in RSV F nanoparticles had a molecular weight between about 1 million Da to about 8 million Da. The length of the single trimer was about 20 nm, and the micelle particle diameter was about 40 nm (see FIG. 12C). These results indicated that HRSV F protein BV #683 has the correct 3D structure for a native, active protein. In summary, a modified recombinant HRSV F protein (e.g., BV #683) has been designed, expressed, and purified. This modified full-length F is glycosylated. Modifications of the primary cleavage site and the fusion domain together greatly enhanced expression level of F protein. In addition, this modified F protein can be cleaved to F1 and F2 subunits, which are disulfide-linked. Trimers of the F1 and F2 subunits form lollipop-shaped spikes of 19.6 nm and particles of 40.2 nm. Moreover, this modified F protein is highly expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Purity of micelles >98% is achieved after purification. The fact that the spikes of this modified protein have a lollipop morphology, which can further form micelles particles of 40 nm, indicates that modified F protein BV #683 has correct 3D structure of a native protein. Example 8 Co-Expression of Modified HRSV F Protein with BRSV M and/or HRSV N in VLP Production The present invention also provides VLPs comprising a modified or mutated RSV F protein. Such VLPs are useful to induce neutralizing antibodies to viral protein antigens and thus can be administered to establish immunity against RSV. For example, such VLPs may comprise a modified RSV F protein, and a BRSV M and/or HRSV N proteins. Codons of genes encoding BRSV M (SEQ ID NO: 14) or HRSV N (SEQ ID NO: 18) proteins can be optimized for expression in insect cells. For example, an optimized BRSV M gene sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 13 and an optimized RSV N gene sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 17. In one experiment, a modified F protein BV #622 and another modified F protein BV #623 (SEQ ID NO: 21, modified such that both cleavage sites are inactivated) were either expressed alone, or co-expressed with HRSV N protein and BRSV M protein. Both crude cell harvests containing VLPs (intracellular) and VLPs pellets collected from 30% sucrose gradient separation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with coomassie, and Western Blot using anti-RSV F monoclonal antibody. FIG. 13 shows the structure of the modified F proteins BV #622 and BV #623, and results of SDS-PAGE and Western Blot analysis. BV #622 was highly expressed by itself or co-expressed with HRSV N protein and BRSV M protein, while BV #623 had very poor expression, indicating that inactivation of both cleavage sites inhibits F protein expression. In another experiment, modified F protein BV #622, double tandem gene BV #636 (BV #541+BRSV M), BV #683, BV #684 (BV #541 with YIAL L-domain introduced at the C terminus), and BV #685 (BV #541 with YKKL L-domain introduced at the C terminus) were either expressed alone, or co-expressed with HRSV N protein and BRSV M protein. L-domain (Late domain) is a conserved sequence in retroviruses, and presents within Gag acting in conjunction with cellular proteins to efficiently release virions from the surface of the cell (Ott et al., 2005, Journal of Virology 79: 9038-9045). The structure of each modified F protein is shown in FIG. 14. Both crude cell harvests containing VLPs (intracellular) and VLPs pellets collected from 30% sucrose gradient separation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with coomassie, and Western Blot using anti-RSV F monoclonal antibody. FIG. 14 shows the results of SDS-PAGE and Western Blot analysis of crude cell harvests containing VLPs (intracellular), and FIG. 15 shows results of SDS-PAGE and Western Blot analysis of VLPs pellets collected from 30% sucrose gradient separation. BV #622 and BV #683 were highly expressed by themselves or co-expressed with HRSV N protein and BRSV M protein, while BV #636, BV #684, and BV #685 had poor expression. Example 9 Screening of Chimeric HRSV F Proteins with High Expression Efforts were made to screen for additional RSV F proteins that could be highly expressed in soluble form in insect cells and could form VLPs with better yield. Various F genes were designed, expressed, and analyzed. Both Western Blot and SDS-PAGE were used to evaluate the expression. FIG. 16A to FIG. 16D summarize the structure, clone name, description, Western Blot/coomassie analysis results, and conclusion for each chimeric HRSV F clone. As the results indicated, wild type full length F protein was poorly expressed; chimeric HRSV F proteins that contain F1 but not F2 subunit could be expressed well, but the products were either insoluble, which might be due to misfolding, or could not assemble with other viral proteins to form VLPs with good yield after co-infections. Inactivation of the primary cleavage site alone did not result in substantial increases in expression, but better expression was achieved when inactivation of the primary cleavage site was combined with other modifications such as deletion of cryptic poly (A) site and correction of GenBank aa errors (e.g., BV #541). Introduction of the YKKL L-domain into the C terminus of BV #541 enhanced the secretion of VLPs containing modified F protein for about 2-3 folds in co-expression with BRSV M and HRSV N proteins. The results further showed that a double tandem chimeric gene consisting of BV #541 and BRSV M genes displayed both improved intracellular expression and improved VLP yield compared to co-infection of BV #541 and BRSV M proteins, indicating that BRSV M protein can facilitate production of VLPs containing a modified HRSV F protein in insect cells when tandemly expressed. A triple tandem chimeric gene consisting of BV #541, BRSV M, and HRSV N had even higher intracellular expression and much better VLP yield compared to above mentioned double tandem chimeric gene or co-infection of BV #541, BRSV M, and HRSV N proteins. Furthermore, the results suggested that chimeric HRSV F protein BV#683 (e.g. F protein 683, SEQ ID NO: 8) had the best intracellular expression. Expression of a double tandem chimeric gene consisting of BV#683 and BRSV M genes, or a triple tandem chimeric gene consisting of BV#683, BRSV M, and HRSV N genes is also embodied herein. These double and triple tandem chimeric gene should further improve VLP production compared to co-infection. Example 10 RSV Neutralization Assay and RSV Challenge Studies in Mice To test the efficiency of a vaccine comprising modified HRSV F protein BV #683 in prohibiting RSV infection, neutralization assays and RSV challenge studies were conducted in mice. The experimental procedures are shown in FIG. 17. Groups of mice (n=10) were injected intramuscularly (except for live RSV) with placebo (PBS solution), live RSV (given intranasally), formalin inactivated RSV vaccine (FI-RSV), 1 μg purified F particles (PFP, modified F protein BV #683), 1 μg purified F particles with Alum (PFP+Alum), 10 μg purified F particles, 10 μg purified F particles with Alum (PFP+Alum), or 30 μg purified F particles on day 0 and day 21. Each immunized group was challenged by live RSV on day 42 (21 days after the second immunization). Mouse serum from each group was harvested on day 0, day 31 (10 days after the second immunization), and day 46 (4 days following challenge with live RSV). Mouse serum from each treatment group was assayed for the presence of anti-RSV neutralization antibodies. Dilutions of serum from immunized mice were incubated with infectious RSV in 96-well microtiter plates. Serum was diluted from 1:20 to 1:2560. 50 μl diluted serum was mixed with 50 μl live RSV virus (Δ00 pfu) in each well. The virus/serum mixture was incubated first for 60 minutes at room temperature, and then mixed with 100 μl HEp-2 cells and incubated for 4 days. The number of infectious virus plaques were then counted after staining with crystal violet. The neutralization titer for each serum sample, defined as the inverse of the highest dilution of serum that produced 100% RSV neutralization (e.g., no plaques), was determined for each animal. The geometric mean serum neutralizing antibody titer at day 31 (10 days after the boost) and day 46 (4 days following challenge with live RSV) were graphed for each vaccine group. FIG. 18 shows the results of the neutralization assays. The results indicated that 10 μg or 30 μg purified F protein produced much higher neutralization titer as compared to live RSV. In addition, neutralization titers of PFP were enhanced with co-administration of Alum adjuvant. RSV challenge studies were carried out to determine if immunization could prevent and/or inhibit RSV replication in the lungs of the immunized animals. The amount of RSV in the lungs of immunized mice was determined by plaque assay using HEp-2 cells Immunized groups of mice mentioned above were infected with 1×106 pfu of infectious RSV long strain intranasally on day 42 (11 days after the second immunization). On day 46 (4 days after RSV infection), lungs of mice were removed, weighed, and homogenized. Homogenized lung tissue was clarified. Supernatant of clarified solution was diluted and subjected to plaque assay using HEp-2 cells to determine RSV titer in lung tissue (calculated as pfu/g lung tissue). Results are shown in FIG. 19, indicating that all mice immunized with recombinant RSV F protein BV #683 had undetectable RSV in the lungs, and even 1 μg purified recombinant HRSV F protein BV #683 without adjuvant exhibited excellent efficiency in inhibiting RSV replication (reduced more then 1000 times compared to placebo). To determine the stability of the RSV PFP vaccine used above, the vaccine was stored at 2-8° C. for 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 weeks, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with coomassie (FIG. 20). The results show that the RSV PFP vaccine is stable at 2-8° C., and there is no detectable degradation. Example 11 Recombinant RSV F Micelle Activity in Cotton Rats In this example, groups included cotton rats immunized at days 0 and 21 with live RSV (RSV), formalin inactivated RSV (FI-RSV), RSV-F protein BV #683 with and without aluminum (PFP and PFP+Aluminum Adjuvant), and PBS controls. As shown in FIG. 21, immunization with 30 μg of the F-micelle vaccine (RSV-F protein BV #683, i.e. F protein 683, SEQ ID NO: 8), with and without aluminum, produced robust neutralizing antibody responses following exposure to both RSV A and RSV B. In addition, it was observed that aluminum significantly enhanced the antibody response. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies were increased following a boost at day 46 or day 49 in RSV A and RSV B, respectively. While significant lung pathology was observed in rats immunized with formalin inactivated RSV (FI-RSV), no disease enhancement was seen with the F-micelle vaccine (FIG. 22). The use of the F-micelle vaccine and the F-micelle vaccine with adjuvant produced lower inflammation scores (4.0 and 2.8, respectively) than the primary RSV infection (PBS+RSV challenge) control group (5.8). As noted above, the FI-RSV treated group had a higher inflammation score than the primary RSV infection (PBS+RSV challenge) control group (9.0 versus 5.8). Moreover, the FI-RSV treated group had a significantly higher mean inflammation score (9.0) than the unchallenged placebo controls, live RSV+RSV challenge, F-micelle+RSV challenge, and F-micelle+aluminum+RSV challenge. Example 12 Preclinical Efficacy of the RSV F Nanoparticle Vaccine in Rats Efficacy of the RSV F Nanoparticle vaccine was tested in cotton rats. Neutralizing antibody responses against RSV-A were assessed in cotton rats immunized with RSV F vaccine±alum. In one study, cotton rats were immunized with one of the following treatment groups: (1) PBS; (2) RSV; (3) formalin inactivated-RSV (FI-RSV); (4) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (1 μg+alum) (5) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (6 μg+alum) (6) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (30 μg+alum) Rats were then bled on day 21 and day 49. Serum from day 49 was tested against RSV-A in neutralizing assays by using a plaque-reduction neutralization test. Results of this experiment are provided in FIG. 23. FIG. 23 is a graph showing neutralizing titers vs. each respective treatment group. The line for each treatment group indicates the geometric mean of end point titer that neutralized the RSV-A virus 100%. The results indicated that the vaccine of the invention neutralized RSV to a greater degree than RSV and FI-RSV. In another study, cotton rats were immunized with one of the following treatment groups. (1) PBS; (2) RSV; (3) FI-RSV; (4) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (1 μg) (5) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (1 μg+alum) (6) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (10 μg) (7) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (10 μg+alum) (8) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (30 μg) Cotton rats were immunized on day 0 and day 21 at 1 with one of the above treatment groups. Rats were subsequently bled on day 31. Sera from all groups were tested against RSV-A in a CPE assay. FIG. 24 shows the neutralizing antibody responses against RSV-A in cotton rats, expressed as Log 2 titers, vs. the respective vaccination group (x-axis). The vaccine of the invention neutralized RSV to a greater degree than RSV and FI-RSV. Additionally, nanoparticle vaccines administered with alum produced a greater number of neutralizing titers than nanoparticle vaccines without alum. In another experiment, cotton rats were immunized with one of the following treatment groups: (1) PBS; (2) RSV; (3) FI-RSV; (4) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (1 μg) (5) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (1 μg+alum) (6) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (6 μg) (7) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (6 μg+alum) (8) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (30 μg) (9) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (30 μg+alum) Cotton Rats were immunized with one of vaccine treatment groups (1)-(9) on day 0 and day 21, and subsequently challenged with RSV A strain virus on day 49. Lung tissues were harvested on day 54 (n=8/group). Tissue was then homogenized and evaluated for the presence of RSV virus using a Hep-2 monolayer plaque assay to detect infectious virus. FIG. 25 shows that neutralizing antibody elicited by RSV F nanoparticles was effective in preventing RSV virus replication in the lungs of challenged animals. In FIG. 25, RSV titers are expressed as log 10 pfu/per gram of lung tissue. An ELISA assay was also carried out on rat sera, treated with the above nine vaccination groups, to determine the presence or absence of anti-RSV antibodies. Sera was pooled for animals in each group and subject to the ELISA assay. Results are provided in FIGS. 26A and 26B as measured by ELISA units (corresponding to the 50% titer on a 4 parameter fit dilution curve; FIG. 26A) or RSV-F IgG titer (FIG. 26B). Animals treated with the vaccine of the present invention produced a greater number of detectable anti-RSV antibodies than animals treated with RSV or FI-RSV. Additionally, alum increased the antibody response. Functional activity of anti-RSV F antibody was evaluated in a RSV neutralization assay by determining the dilution of antisera capable of inhibiting 100% RSV cytopathic activity on HEp-2 cell monolayers Immunization with all doses of unadjuvanted RSV F nanoparticles resulted in the development of RSV neutralizing antibody (FIG. 26C). Consistent with results for the anti-RSV F IgG, co-administration of aluminum phosphate adjuvant increased RSV neutralizing antibody titers 3.5-18 fold. Neutralizing antibody titers induced with live RSV were comparable to the low dose RSF F adjuvanted group and likely a component was directed against the RSV G protein. Sera from cotton rats immunized with formalin inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) did not exhibit neutralizing activity (FIG. 26C; FI-RSV). Antigenic site II on the RSV F protein has been shown to be the target of palivizumab, a humanized RSV neutralizing monoclonal antibody used in prophylaxis for the prevention of RSV disease. To determine whether antibodies directed against antigenic site II were induced by immunization with RSV F nanoparticles, a palivizumab competitive ELISA was performed using pooled sera from the individual animals within each group. Sera obtained from either live RSV treated animals, FI-RSV immunized animals, or PBS control animals did not inhibit palivizumab binding (FIG. 26D). In contrast, serum pools obtained from animals immunized with RSV F nanoparticles had high levels of antibody that inhibited the binding of Palivizumab to RSV F (FIG. 26D). This result was achieved for pools from all doses, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant. These data demonstrate that the RSV F protein stimulates antibodies with the same specificity as palivizumab. Histopathology The histopathology of the cotton rat challenged with RSV was also studied. Cotton rats were immunized with one of the following vaccination groups on day 0 and day 21: (1) RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (1 μg, 6 μg, or 30 μg; +/−alum) (2) FI-RSV (3) RSV (4) PBS (5) PBS Rats from groups (1)-(4) were subsequently challenged with RSV A strain virus on day forty-nine. Rats from group (5) were not challenged with the virus. Lung tissue was isolated five days after challenge. Tissue were frozen, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Representative micrographs are provided to indicate peribronchiolitis condition in the control animals and 30 μg+alum vaccine groups (FIG. 27). Slides were evaluated in a blinded fashion using a score of 0 to 4 (0=no; 1=minimal; 2=mild; 3=moderate; 4=maximum inflammation) in order of increasing severity for each of the following 5 parameters: a) bronchiolitis; b) vasculitis; c) bronchitis; d) alveolitis and e) interstitial pneumonitis (as described in Prince G A, et al. (1986) J Virol 57: 721-728). The summary value for each of the five parameters was added together to arrive at a single summary score for each animal. Summary scores for each group were used to arrive at the total average score/group expressed as the arithmetic mean±the SEM. Analysis of the histopathology scores for the various experimental groups (Table 1) demonstrated that FI-RSV exacerbated inflammation upon subsequent challenge with live virus. The total histopathology score for FI-RSV was significantly higher than that observed for non-immune animals challenged with RSV (mean 5.63; p<0.0001, t-test). No significant increase in pathology was observed in any RSV F immunized group either in the presence or absence of alum relative to the control groups. The cotton rats infected with RSV and challenged with RSV had a mean score of 0.75. The next lowest histopathology scores of 1.13 and 1.43 were in the adjuvanted vaccine groups immunized respectively with 6 μg or 30 μg RSV F nanoparticles (Table 1). These data demonstrate that the adjuvanted RSV F nanoparticle vaccine inhibits lung inflammation after RSV challenge.

Pre immune and a pool of day 28 serum from mice immunized on day 0 with 30 μg RSV F with alum were mixed with 50 ng/mL biotin-Palivizumab epitope peptide. These samples were then serially diluted and incubated with purified RSV F coated ELISA plate. Streptavidin was used to determine Palivizumab bound to the plate. An unweighted four parameter logistic regression curve is presented in FIG. 28. The results indicated that antibodies produced by the nanoparticle vaccine of the invention competed with Palivizumab peptide for binding the target RSV. Example 14 RSV Nanoparticle Vaccine-Palivizumab Assay Binding of the RSV nanoparticle vaccine of the invention to Synagis was assayed. Binding of Synagis mAb to Palivizumab Epitope Peptide. ELISA plates were coated with streptavidin at 5 μg/mL. Palivizumab peptide at 1 μg/mL was bound to the plate to the streptavidin via a biotin linker. Synagis® at 10 μg/mL was serially diluted four fold and incubated to the peptide on the plate. Synagis® binding was detected using anti human HRP reaction. The results are provided in FIG. 29A (left graph). Binding of Synagis® to Recombinant RSV F Micelles. ELISA plates were coated with 2 μg/ml RSV F micelle antigen. Synagis® at 10 μg/mL concentration serially diluted four fold and reacted to RSV F on the plate. Anti human HRP reaction was used to determine the Synagis binding to RSV F micelles. An unweighted four parameter logistic regression curve is presented (FIG. 29B, right graph). The results indicated that Synagis® recognized and bound the vaccine of the invention. Example 15 Clinical Safety of the RSV F Nanoparticle Vaccine A Phase 1 randomized, observer blinded placebo controlled trial was carried out to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the RSV nanoparticle vaccine in healthy adults in a dose-escalating fashion. 150 healthy adults were administered two immunizations at day 0 and at day 30. The treatment groups are provided in Table 2, below. Demographic and subject dispositions for the subjects are provided in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Additionally, there were no vaccine related severe adverse events. Example 16 Immunogenicity of the RSV F Nanoparticle Vaccine The Phase 1 trial was carried out, as provided in Example 15. The immunogenicity of the RSV nanoparticle viruses was assessed. The scheme for various assays utilized to assess immunogenicity is provided in FIG. 30. RSV F/Synagis (Palivizumab) Peptide ELISA Treatment Placebo 5 μg + 15 μg + 30 μg + 30 μg 60 μg + 60 μg Groups (group Alum Alum Alum (group Alum (group 7) 1) (group 2) (group 3) (group 4) 5) (group 6) ELISA plates were coated with streptavidin at 5 μg/mL. Palivizumab peptide at 1 μg/mL was bound to Streptavidin. Human sera from subjects treated with the vaccine of the invention was introduced to the plates. Secondary antibody (anti human HRP) was then added to detect anti-RSV F IgG against the Palivizumab peptide. FIG. 31 provides the results of this study. Each of the nanoparticle vaccine treatment groups produced significantly more RSV IgG than the control group, and the alum groups performed better than the non-alum groups. In FIG. 31, each treatment group includes three measurements: (1) sera at day 1 (left bar), (2) sera at day 30 (middle bar), (3) sera at day 60 (right bar). Anti-RSV F IgG ELISA Treatment Placebo 5 μg + 15 μg + 30 μg + 30 μg 60 μg + 60 μg Groups (group 1) Alum Alum Alum (group Alum (group (group 2) (group 3) (group 4) 5) (group 6) 7) ELISA plates were coated with 2 μg/mL RSV F or RSV G antigen. Human sera from subjects treated with the vaccine of the invention followed by challenge with RSV was introduced to the plates. Secondary antibody (anti human HRP) was then added to detect anti-RSV F or anti-RSV G IgG in the human sera. Each of the nanoparticle vaccine treatment groups produced IgG antibodies against RSV F at all time points tested (FIG. 32A). In contrast, the vaccine treatment groups induced production of negligible amounts of anti-RSV G antibodies (FIG. 32B). In FIG. 32 A an B, each treatment group includes three measurements: (1) sera at day 1 (left bar), (2) sera at day 30 (middle bar), (3) sera at day 60 (right bar). The results of this experiment are also provided in Tables 5A and 5B, below. Table 5A shows the geometric mean of IgG levels in all groups. The geometric mean fold rise in IgG levels was also plotted for the alum groups (FIG. 33). A significant dose response was achieved (p<0.05). Table 5B shows the results of the ELISA (expressed as ELISA Units) for individual subjects in the 60 μg+Alum group.

FIG. 34 shows that day 60 antibodies were significantly higher than placebo for all groups. Post-immunization PRNTs in vaccine groups exceeded levels that have been estimated to be protective in the elderly, children and infants. FIG. 35 shows the reverse cumulative distribution for Day 0, Day 30 and Day 60 PRNTs in the placebo and 30 μg+Alum groups. Minimum titers at day 0 were 5 log2 and minimum titer post-immunization with RSV F recombinant nanoparticles at day 60 was 8.5 log2. Example 17 Avidity of Antibodies Induced by the RSV F Nanoparticle Vaccine The Phase 1 trial was carried out, as provided in Example 15. The avidity of antibodies in the human sera for RSV F was determined using a BIAcore SPR-based measurement system. RSV F protein was immobilized on a sensor surface, and sera were passed over the immobilized RSV F. Binding to the immobilized RSV F was measured based on the molecular mass on the sensor surface. Association and dissociation rates were measured as a function of time and plotted on a sensorgram, and the dissociation constant was calculated from the association and dissociation rates. FIG. 36 provides the controls for the BIAcore SPR-based assay. FIG. 36A shows the association rates (k-On), dissociation rates (k-Off), and dissociation constants (KD) for positive controls palivizumab antibody and RSV reference sera (available from BEI Resources and described in Yang et al. 2007, Biologicals 35; 183-187). FIG. 36B shows a sensorgram to demonstrate negative results from Day 0 and placebo control sera from the Phase 1 trial, in contrast to positive control palivizumab. FIG. 37 provides the binding curves for palivizumab antibody and a representative vaccinee (subject ID#1112, day 30). The results of the study for 13 subjects in the 60 μg vaccine+adjuvant group are provided in Table 6, below. At Day 30, the KD for these 13 subjects ranged from 0.11 pmol to 992 pmol; at Day 60, the KD ranged from 0.00194 pmol to 675 pmol. Thus, the avidity of antibodies in the human sera for RSV F was, like the palivizumab antibody control, in the picomolar range.

Palivizumab-like IgG antibodies (antibodies that compete with palivizumab epitope peptide for binding RSV F) in the sera from 13 subjects in the 60 μg+adjuvant group were measured via a competitive binding assay. The results, provided in Table 7 below, indicated that Palivizumab-like antibodies were well above protective levels (>40 μg/mL) in all subjects tested at both Day 30 and Day 60.

F protein was produced in Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus. The cells were lysed and solubilized with detergent, and the F protein was purified chromatographically. The antigen was administered by intramuscular injection, with or without adsorption to ALPO4. Healthy adults (N=150; mean age 31.3 years; 59% female) were enrolled in 6 cohorts, each including 20 active vaccine and 5 placebo recipients. Test articles were given as 2-dose series at a 30 day interval. RSV F antigen was tested at doses of 5, 15, 30 and 60 μg adsorbed to AlPO4, and 30 and 60 μg without adjuvant. Safety was monitored by soliciting local and systemic symptoms for 7 days after each dose, and ascertainment of unsolicited adverse events for 6 months. Functional antibodies were assessed using the plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) and microneutralization (MN) assays (which gave similar results) and ELISA assays for multiple antigens as below. The results of the trial indicated that MN responses appeared to lag anti-F responses (FIG. 38). MN antibody responses occurred in the active groups, but anti-F responses were much more dynamic Whereas baseline anti-F IgG titers spanned a more limited range, baseline microneutralization (MN) titers varied over a >32-fold range. The vaccine induced substantial MN responses in subjects with low MN baselines (geometric mean 3.9-fold rises in those in the lowest ⅓ of the population), but overall fold-rises were limited by the ⅓ of subjects with high baseline values (where <2-fold responses were noted). The results of the trial also showed that RSV F Nanoparticle Vaccine Elicited antibody Responses to antigenic site II Peptide 254-278 (FIG. 39). Synthetic RSV-F peptide 254-278, which harbors the palivizumab and motavizumab epitopes, was biotinylated and immobilized to streptavidin-coated plates. Serial dilutions of sera were incubated with the peptide coated plates. Bound IgG was detected after washing with enzyme-conjugated goat anti-human IgG. Pre-immunization titers were uniformly low, but increased 5- to 15-fold with receipt of RSV-F nanoparticle vaccine. FIG. 40 and Table 8 show the results of a palivizumab competition ELISA with human serum before and after RSV-F nanoparticle immunization. ELISA plates were coated with RSV F protein antigen at 2 μg/mL. Pre- and post-immunization sera were serially diluted, spiked with 50 ng/mL biotinylated palivizumab, and then incubated in the coated plates. Enzyme-conjugated streptavidin was used to detect palivizumab bound to the plate. A four-parameter fit was generated and the serum dilution yielding 50% palivizumab binding inhibition was interpolated. Antibodies competitive with Palivizumab were present in low titer in normal adult sera, but were markedly increased by immunization with the RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (FIG. 40A). FIG. 40B shows the geometric-mean fold increase in palivizumab binding inhibition post dose 1 and post dose 2 in all subject groups. Adjuvant enhanced the palivizumab inhibition of vaccine-induced sera, and the 60 ug+adjuvant group exhibited the highest levels of palivizumab inhibition.

Despite anti-F titers present at Day 0, most healthy young adult sera yielded values at or near the palivizumab competition assay LLOQ. On Day 60, placebo recipients had an unchanged distribution, but active vaccinees (in red) showed an increase in anti-F antibodies with enrichment of palivizumab-competitive specificities. Unlabeled palivizumab, added to normal serum, achieved 50% inhibition in the competitive ELISA at 2.1 μg/mL. This was used in Table 9 to calculate an approximate equivalent of “palivizumab-like” activity in vaccinee serum. In parallel, palivizumab was also spiked into 5 normal adult sera at three different levels, and its impact on MN titer was determined; increases in GMTs based on 2 replicates on each of 2 different days are shown in TABLE 9 50% inhibitory GMTs and calculated palivizumab-like activity in subject sera. 15 μg + 30 μg 30 μg + 60 μg + Placebo 5 μg + Al Al only Al 60 μg Al Day 0 GMT 6 6 7 7 5 10 7 (95% CI) (5-6) (5-8) (5-10) (5-10) (—) (7-15) (5-10) Day 0 11 13 15 15 10 21 15 “palivizumab equivalent” (μg/mL) Day 60 GMT 7 55 64 50 71 79 169 (95% CI) (6-9) (38-81) (51-80) (34-73) (57-88) (54-115) (127-224) Day 60 15 116 135 106 149 165 337 “palivizumab equivalent” (μg/mL) Day 0 GMT 6 6 7 7 5 10 7 (95% CI) (5-6) (5-8) (5-10) (5-10) (—) (7-15) (5-10) TABLE 10 Impact of defined palivizumab inputs on MN activity in human adult sera.

The levels of palivizumab-like activity achieved by the vaccine were commensurate with those that have been efficacious when passively administered to infants. Example 19 RSV F-Specific Monoclonal Antibodies Bind the RSV F Nanoparticle Vaccine Antigen Various RSV F neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are known in the art and described, for example, in Crowe J E et al., Virology 252; 373 (1998), and in Beeler et al., Journal of Virology 63; 2941 (1989), both of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. FIG. 42 shows a schematic representation of the antibody recognition regions of the RSV F vaccine antigen, which are Site I, Site II, and Site IV/V/IV. RSV F vaccine antigen was plated at 2 μg/mL. RSV-specific monoclonal antibodies were serially diluted four fold and incubated with the RSV F vaccine antigen, and antibody binding was detected using anti-mouse HRP. As shown in FIG. 42, the vaccine antigen was able to elicit binding of several neutralizing RSV F antibodies, including antibodies that bind at Site I, II, or IV/V/VI of the antigen. Example 20 RSV F Nanoparticle Vaccine-Induced Immune Responses in Cotton Rats In this example, the efficacy of the RSV F vaccine was further tested in four groups of female cotton rats (5 per group). Group 1 animals received two intramuscular vaccinations, one on Day 0 and one on Day 28, with Formalin Inactivated RSV virus (FI-RSV) adsorbed onto alum at a 1:25 dilution. Animals in Group 2 received intramuscular vaccinations on Day 0 and Day 28 with 30 μg of the recombinant RSV-F nanoparticle vaccine, formulated with adjuvant (2.4 mg/mL AIP04). Animals in Group 3 received the two vaccinations with 30 μg of the recombinant RSV-F nanoparticle vaccine in the absence of adjuvant. Animals in Group 4 were infected intranasally with 105 p.f.u of RSV-A2 (0.05 mL per nare) on Day 0 and Day 28. Sera were collected from all animals at Days 0, 28, and 49. Polyclonal sera samples from immunized and infected cotton rats were serially diluted five fold and incubated with the RSV F antigen, plated at 2 μg/mL. Bound antibody was detected using anti-rat HRP. As shown in FIG. 43, the RSV F vaccine induced robust anti-RSV IgG antibodies in cotton rats. Both RSV F vaccine groups elicited higher IgG titers compared to either immunization with FI-RSV or infection with RSV A2 at Days 28 and 49. The presence of adjuvant further increased the IgG titer at both Day 28 and Day 49 (FIG. 43). Neutralizing antibody responses in cotton rats were tested using a Hep-2 cell line infection assay. Serum dilutions were incubated with infectious RSV in plates, then the RSV/serum mixture was incubated with Hep-2 cells. The number of infectious virus plaques were counted, and neutralization titers were calculated as the inverse of the highest dilution of serum that produced 50% RSV inhibition of infection. Day 0 serum did not exhibit measurable neutralization titers in any group. FI-RSV groups did not exhibit neutralization titers at any timepoint. At Day 49, mice infected with RSV A2 exhibited similar levels of neutralizing antibody to those immunized with RSV F in the absence of adjuvant. The highest neutralization titers were detected at Day 49 in the RSV F vaccine+adjuvant group, indicating that neutralization titers were induced most robustly in animals receiving RSV F vaccine in the presence of adjuvant (FIG. 44). To determine if neutralization is inhibited by the presence of RSV-F, cotton rat sera were pre-incubated with 20 μg/mL of BSA, RSV F protein, RSV G protein, or both RSV F and RSV G protein, prior to incubation with Hep-2 cells in the neutralization assay. As shown in Table 11, pre-incubation with RSV F protein reduced neutralization titers to undetectable or nearly undetectable levels in sera from RSV A2-infected mice as well as mice immunized with the RSV F vaccine, with or without adjuvant. TABLE 11 Neutralization of RSV is inhibited by the presence of RSV F protein Cotton Rat BSA + RSVF + RSVG + RSV G + RSV Samples Sera Sera Sera F + Sera FI-RSV <20 <20 <20 <20 RSVF-Adj 1280 40 640 20 RSV F 320 <20 320 <20 RSV-A2 Infection 160 40 40 <20 A Hep-2 cell line fusion inhibition assay was used to test the ability of antibodies induced by FI-RSV, RSV F vaccine with or without adjuvant, or live RSV A2 to inhibit fusion-mediated RSV infection. Hep-2 cells were briefly pre-incubated with live RSV prior to incubation of the cells with serum dilutions from each group. The number of infectious virus plaques were counted, and fusion inhibition was expressed as the inverse of the dilution that resulted in 50% inhibition of plaque formation. FIG. 45 shows that fusion-mediated infection of Hep-2 cells was inhibited by Day 49 sera from infected rats or rats immunized with RSV F vaccine, with or without adjuvant. However, fusion inhibition was enhanced by the presence of adjuvant. Further, at the Day 28 timepoint, only sera from rats immunized with RSV F vaccine with adjuvant inhibited fusion. Pre-incubation of rat sera with RSV F protein abrogated the fusion inhibition capacity in all groups, as shown in Table 12, indicating that the inhibition of fusion was mediated by RSV F-specific antibodies. TABLE 12 Fusion inhibition is abrogated by the presence of RSV-F protein Cotton Rat Samples BSA RSVF FI-RSV <20 <20 RSVF-Adj 2560 20 RSV F 40 <20 RSV-A2 Infection 20 20 RSV-A2/RSV F 80 20 RSVF/RSV-A2 160 20 Serum samples from individual animals were assessed for the capacity to compete with palivizumab monoclonal antibody for binding to RSV F. Serial dilutions of serum samples were incubated with biotinylated palivizumab prior to incubation with plate-bound RSV F, followed by detection of bound palivizumab with avidin-HRP. Data were expressed as the inverse of the geometric mean titer of antibodies that exhibited 50% inhibition of palivizumab binding. Sera obtained from FI-RSV immunized animals did not inhibit palivizumab binding. Minimal inhibition of palivizumab binding was observed with sera from animals treated with live RSV. In contrast, sera from animals immunized with the RSV F vaccine exhibited competition with palivizumab for binding to RSV F nanoparticles, and competition was further enhanced with sera from animals that also received adjuvant (FIG. 46). Cotton rat sera from animals within each group were also assessed for the ability to inhibit the binding of other RSV-F-specific monoclonal antibodies. Serum-mediated inhibition of binding of antibodies 1107, 1153, 1243, 1112, or 1269, which bind to Sites I (1243), II (1107 and 1153), or IV, V, VI (1112 and 1269), of the RSV F protein, was determined Serial dilutions of sera from each group were incubated with biotinylated antibodies 1107, 1153, 1112, 1269, or 1243 prior to incubation with plate-bound RSV F, followed by detection with avidin-HRP. 50% inhibition titers were calculated as the inverse of the highest dilution at which binding to RSV F was 50% inhibited. As shown in FIG. 47, inhibition of neutralizing RSV F-specific monoclonal antibody binding to RSV F was enhanced with sera from rats immunized with RSV F vaccine compared to rats immunized with FI-RSV or live RSV-A2, and was further enhanced in the presence of adjuvant. The avidity of anti-RSV antibodies induced by immunization with the RSV F nanoparticle vaccine was compared to the avidity of anti-RSV antibodies induced by immunization with FI-RSV. Direct ELISAs were conducted in which serial dilutions of cotton rat sera were incubated in plates with bound RSV antigen, and levels of bound antibody prior to or after a 7 molar urea wash step were measured. Antibodies in sera from RSV F nanoparticle vaccine immunized animals exhibited higher avidity for RSV in comparison to antibodies in sera from FI-RSV immunized animals (FIG. 48). A larger percentage of the RSV-specific antibodies in sera from vaccine immunized animals was high avidity, as shown by the amount of antibody bound before and after the urea wash (FIG. 48 and Table 13).
