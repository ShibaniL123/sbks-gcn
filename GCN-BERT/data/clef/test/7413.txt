LOW-DENSITY HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE AND RELATED METHODS FIELD OF INVENTION [0001 ] In general, this invention relates to low-density, high-strength concrete that is self-compacting and lightweight, and to related concrete mixes that, among the many multiple uses thereof, may be used for walls, building structures, architectural panels, concrete blocks, insulation, poles and beams, roofing, fencing, shotcrete, floating structures, concrete backfill, and fireproofing, and includes the methods of manufacturing such items or structures using such a lightweight concrete, and the steps of providing such a lightweight concrete composition and the unmixed components thereof. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION [0002] Concrete is an important building material for structural purposes and nonstructural purposes alike. Concrete, generally speaking, includes cementitious materials and aggregate. There may be one or more types of cementitious material and one or more types of aggregate. Concrete may also include voids and reinforcing materials, such as fiber or steel rod (rebar), wire mesh or other forms of reinforcement. It can have high compressive strength, wear-resistance, durability, and water-resistance, be lightweight, readily formed into a variety of shapes and forms, and be very economical compared to alternative construction materials. The formation process includes the presence of water to permit the cementitious materials to harden and to form bonds with itself, with any aggregate, and with reinforcing materials. That hydration process, which involves some of the water present being used in those chemical reactions, is well-known and -understood. [0003] Yet the use or value of concrete as a building material may be limited by a number of factors. Those factors pertaining to finished structures and products include: weight, relatively poor tensile strength, ductility, the inability to readily cut, drill or nail, and poor insulating properties. Those factors pertaining to the concrete before setting include: weight, limited flowability (and/or reduced strength caused by adding water to overcome the same), requirement to vibrate or otherwise compact the concrete to limit voids, segregation of aggregate, and the like. Those factors pertaining to the precursor materials or components supplied for use in making concrete structures or products include: cost, weight, and segregation of aggregate and other materials. [0004] Lightweight concretes have been developed to reduce the limiting effect of the weight of both finished concrete structures and products and uncured concrete. Such lightweight concretes ("LWC") typically involve replacing some or all of the aggregate in a mix with another form of aggregate that is less dense than commonly-used aggregate. Such aggregate may be known as lightweight aggregate ("LWA"). LWCs often have lower strength (such as tensile, compressive, elastic modulus) than a comparable concrete not using LWA, but may have higher strength-to-weight ratios due to the reduced density of the concrete and the weight for a given structure or product. [0005] A structural LWC is ordinarily considered to have a density between about 90 - 120 Ib/cu.ft. and a compressive strength from 2500 psi to over 8000 psi. These values may be measured by ASTM C567 and ASTM C39, respectively. [0006] A variety of characteristics of the set concrete or its behavior during the manufacturing process can be measured and/or designed into that process. These include tensile strength, compressive strength, elastic modulus, modulus of rupture, plastic density, bulk density, oven-dried density, R-value, coefficient of thermal expansion, crack resistance, impact-resistance, fire resistance, slump, water/cement ratio, paste content by volume, weights, and weight-fractions. [0007] The amount or characteristics of the LWA used, or the amount of ordinary aggregate replaced by LWA, may be constrained by the need to meet certain minimum characteristics, including but not limited to tensile strength, compressive strength, elastic modulus, flexural strength, or modulus of rupture. Other constraints may include segregation of the LWA within the concrete. [0008] In some cases, other materials are added to the mix or to the precursor materials to improve one or more of the characteristics of the cured concrete or its behavior during the manufacturing process. These may be known as admixtures. Admixtures may be liquid or solid, but are typically liquid unless the mix is to be kept in the dry state, such as for making bagged concrete mix. [0009] It is an advantage for LWC to have a reduced density, higher strengths, higher strength-to-weight ratios, and increased R-value, as well as improved crack resistance, impact-resistance, and fire resistance. Reduction of the density and weight of the concrete offers a variety of advantages, including but not limited to: reduced structure weight and loading in dead loads in buildings and structures; easier and cheaper transportation and handling of the concrete products, lower transportation costs (equipment / fuel); improved thermal insulating properties, fire resistance, and acoustical properties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0010] An embodiment of the present invention includes a self-compacting LWC having a low density, high strength-to-weight ratio, good segregation-resistance, and a high R-value. An embodiment of the present invention includes a LWC having a high replacement volume, a low weight-fraction of aggregate to total dry raw materials, and highly-homogenous distribution of LWA. [0011] An embodiment of the present invention includes a LWC that has a density less than 50% of what is ordinarily found in structural LWC (about 90 - 120 Ib/cu.ft.) while having at least the minimum compressive strength of about 2500 psi of a structural LWC or, in another embodiment, at least a minimum compressive strength of about 3000 psi. [0012] An embodiment of the present invention includes a LWC that has a more moderate replacement volume and weight-fraction of aggregate to total dry raw materials, a highly-homogenous distribution of LWA, and a density between about 50% and 75% of what is ordinarily found in structural LWC (about 90 - 120 Ib/cu.ft.), while having at least a minimum compressive strength of about 2500 psi of a structural LWC and up to or above about 150% of that strength. [0013] An embodiment of the present invention includes a LWC having a low replacement volume, a high weight-fraction of aggregate to total dry raw materials, a highly-homogenous distribution of LWA, and a density about what is ordinarily found in structural LWC (about 90 - 120 Ib/cu.ft.), and a compressive strength of about two or three times the minimum compressive strength (2500 psi) of a structural LWC. [0014] That LWC includes a LWA that is composed of glass microspheres, which are substantially less dense than water, are closed-cell, smooth and non-absorptive, and vast majority of the particles are smaller than 115 microns. [0015] An embodiment of the invention is a LWC including a LWA composed of glass microspheres between around 0.10 and 0.40 specific gravity ("SG"), and whose size distribution is such that about 90% are smaller than about 115 microns, and about 10% are smaller than about 10 microns, and the median size is in the range of about 30-65 microns. Such glass microspheres may have about a 90% survival rate (i.e. they are not crushed) at pressures ranging from about 250 - 4000 psi or higher. [0016] Particular embodiments of the glass microsphere LWA is include one in which the density is about 0.15 SG, the median size is about 55 microns, and 80% are between about 25-90 microns. Such glass microspheres have about a 90% survival rate at about 300 psi. Another particular embodiment of the glass microspheres is one in which the density is about 0.35 SG, the median size is about 40 microns, and 80% are between about 10-75 microns, with about a 90% survival rate at about 3000 psi. [0017] An embodiment of the invention is a LWC including a LWA composed of a mixture of two or more particular types of glass microspheres, such that the two or more varieties compose all of the LWA in the LWC. [0018] An embodiment of the present invention includes a self-compacting LWC mix having a high replacement volume, a low weight-fraction of aggregate to total dry raw materials, and highly-homogenous mix properties. That LWC mix includes a LWA that is composed of glass microspheres, as described above. [0019] Embodiments of the LWC and LWC mixes include those in which other aggregates are present in addition to one or more types of LWA. Such ordinary aggregates may include, but are not limited to, sand, and gravel. Embodiments also include LWC including LWA both with reinforcing materials, such as fiber or steel rod (re-bar) or wire mesh or other forms of reinforcing, or without reinforcement. [0020] Embodiments of the LWC and LWC mixes include cementitious materials, which may include one or more materials such as hydraulic cements, Portland cements, fly ash, silica fume (fumed silica), pozzolana cements, gypsum cements, aluminous cements, magnesia cements, silica cements, and slag cements. Cements may also be colored. [0021 ] An embodiment of the present invention includes the steps of preparing a LWC mix having a high replacement volume, a low weight-fraction of aggregate to total dry raw materials, and highly-homogenous mix properties. [0022] An embodiment of the present invention includes the steps of preparing a LWC mix having a more moderate replacement volume and weight-fraction of aggregate to total dry raw materials, and highly-homogenous mix properties. [0023] An embodiment of the present invention includes the steps of preparing a LWC mix having a low replacement volume, high weight-fraction of aggregate to total dry raw materials, and highly-homogenous mix properties. [0024] Those LWC mixes includes a LWA that is composed of glass microspheres, as described above. A mix may be prepared with liquids for forming concrete therefrom, or as a dry mix, such as for a bagged concrete mix. A wet mix may be prepared, for example, in either a drum-type mixer, a pan-type mixer, or a ribbon blender. A dry mix may be prepared, for example, in a pan-type mixer. [0025] An embodiment of the present invention includes wet mix methods. These include ready mix methods, such as concrete precursor materials prepared and mixed on-site, either for use on-site or for transport, and such as concrete precursor materials forming the unmixed components of a LWC mix, prepared for batching and mixed during transportation. Admixtures may be added during mixing, or during batching. [0026] An embodiment of the present invention includes dry mix methods. These include dry concrete precursor materials prepared and mixed or blended on-site, with only dry admixtures if necessary, and bagged or otherwise prepared for sale. [0027] An embodiment of the present invention includes manufacturing and mixing processes. Such processes include a concrete manufacturer acquiring concrete precursor materials including water (such as either by purchase or extraction) and any admixtures, preparing batches, weighing or otherwise measuring them individually (or together in such a way as to permit the components to be measured), and providing the unmixed components of a LWC mix, such as by depositing the components into a concrete mixing truck. Such processes also include a concrete manufacturer acquiring concrete precursor materials including water (such as either by purchase or extraction) and any admixtures, preparing batches including weighing the components individually, holding them for delivery, and providing the components, such as by depositing the components into a stationary concrete mixer or other type of mixer. [0028] In the case of a stationary concrete mixer, such a concrete manufacturer may use the mixed concrete on-site, such as for a structure, or may be a pre-caster. A pre- caster will cast concrete products on- or off-site using molds or forms, but those products are typically transported for use elsewhere. Examples of pre-cast products include but are not limited to concrete blocks, structural beams, and architectural panels. [0029] An embodiment of the present invention includes a self-compacting LWC composition having a high strength after curing for 3 days, 7 days and 28 days, and has a low oven-dried density, including embodiments in which that density is below 130, 120, 110, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, and even 40 Ib./cu.ft., and embodiments at about 40 Ib./cu.ft. in which the compressive strengths are over 1200 and over about 1600 psi at 3-days, over about 1500 psi at 7-days, over about 1750 psi at 14-days, and over about 2750, over about 3100 and over about 3800 psi at 28-days.

[0030] An embodiment of the present invention including an ordinary aggregate such as sand includes a self-compacting LWC composition having a high strength after curing for 3 days, 7 days and 28 days, and has a low oven-dried density, including embodiments in which that density is above 90, and below 90, 80, 70, and even 60 Ib./cu.ft., including embodiments at or below about 60 Ib./cu.ft. in which the compressive strengths are over about 1700, about 2000 and about 2200 psi at 3-days, over 1800 and about 2750 psi at 7-days, and over about 2500 and about 4000 psi at 28-days. Embodiments also include LWC with an oven-dried density over 60 Ib./cu.ft. in which the compressive strengths are over about 2300, and about 3700 psi at 3-days, over about 2700 and about 4300 psi at 7-days, and over about 3000 and about 4700 psi at 10-days. Embodiments of the present invention at or below about 60 Ib./cu.ft. include a self-compacting LWC composition for which the strength-to-density ratio is at or above about 25 and about 40 for the 3-day compressive strength, at or above about 30 and about 50 for the 7-day compressive strength, and above about 40 and about 70 for the 28-day compressive strength. Embodiments also include a self-compacting LWC composition with an oven-dried density over 60 Ib./cu.ft. for which the strength-to- density ratio is at or above about 30 for the 3-day compressive strength, at or above about 35 for the 7-day compressive strength, and above about 40 for the 10-day compressive strength. [0031 ] An embodiment of the present invention including an ordinary aggregate such as gravel includes a self-compacting LWC composition having a high strength after curing for 7 days and 28 days, and has a low oven-dried density, including embodiments in which that density is about 120, about 100, or below about 80 Ib./cu.ft., and embodiments at about 120 Ib./cu.ft. in which the compressive strengths are over about 4000 and about 5000 psi at 3-days, over about 4000, about 5000 and about 6000 psi at 7-days, and over about 4000, about 5000 and about 7000 psi at 28-days.

[0049] An embodiment of the present invention includes a self-compacting LWC having a low density, high strength-to-weight ratio, high strength-to-density ratio, good segregation-resistance, and a high R-value. An embodiment of the present invention includes a LWC having a high replacement volume, a low weight-fraction of aggregate to total dry raw materials, and highly-homogenous distribution of LWA. [0050] An embodiment of the present invention includes a LWC that has a density about 50%, or even less (as low as about 30 or 35 Ib/cu.ft), as compared to the ordinary value for structural LWC (about 90 - 120 Ib/cu.ft.), and has 28-day compressive strengths of over 1750 psi, over 2000 psi, over 2500 psi and over 3000 psi. Embodiments of the present invention also includes a LWC that has a density that falls at about ½ to ¾ the ordinary value for structural LWC (about 90 - 120 Ib/cu.ft.), and has 28-day compressive strengths of over 2500 psi, and over 4000 psi. Embodiments of the present invention also includes a LWC that has a density that falls in about the same range as the ordinary value for structural LWC (about 90 - 120 Ib/cu.ft.), and has 28- day compressive strengths of over 5000 psi, and over 7000 psi. [0051 ] A LWA of an embodiment of the invention comprises glass microspheres, which are less dense than water and preferably substantially much less dense, are closed- cell, substantially resistant to volumetric change under pressure, smooth and non- absorptive, and vast majority of the microspheres are smaller than 115 microns. The glass microspheres may range between around 0.10 and 0.60 specific gravity ("SG"), and have a size distribution such that about 90% are smaller than about 115 microns, and about 10% are smaller than about 9 microns, and the median size is in the range of about 18-65 microns. Such glass microspheres may have about a 90% survival rate (i.e. they are not crushed) at pressures ranging from about 250 - 28000 psi. [0052] Through pressurization in a mercury penetrometer, microspheres and the materials in which they are utilized can have their isostatic crush strength measured. The crush strength distribution gets revealed by analyzing the volume change as the pressure increases. Such data gets analyzed by using a metric commonly referred to as the "survival rate" to which the apparent pore volume stays intact. Sphere size and wall strength determine the crush strength. Owing to the irreversible nature of crushing, the entrapment can be up to 100%. [0053] Particular embodiments of the glass microsphere LWA include one in which the density is about 0.15 SG, the median size is about 55 microns and some 80% are between about 25-90 microns. Such 0.15 SG glass microspheres have an approximate 90% survival rate at about 300 psi. Another particular embodiment of the glass microspheres is one in which the density is about 0.35 SG, the median size is about 40 microns, and 80% are between about 10-75 microns, with such 0.35 SG microspheres having an approximate 90% survival rate at about 3000 psi. In yet other embodiments, microspheres can be as large as 300 microns. [0054] Other types of hollow glass microspheres may have the following approximate characteristics: Table I: [0055] Concretes including a LWA having a higher crush strength are generally stronger. A LWA may be composed of a mixture of two or more particular types of glass microspheres, such that the two or more varieties compose all of the LWA in the LWC. This mixed LWA may have the advantage of enabling the concrete design to meet certain density and/or strength or strength-to-weight targets that would difficult with just one LWA. [0056] Embodiments of the LWC and LWC mixes also include those in which other aggregates are present, in addition to one or more types of LWA. Examples of such ordinary aggregates include sand, gravel, pea gravel, pumice, perlite, vermiculite, scoria, and diatomite; concrete aggregate, such as, expanded shale, expanded slate, expanded clay, expanded slag, pelletized aggregate, tuff, and macrolite; and masonry aggregate, such as, expanded shale, clay, slate, expanded blast furnace slag, sintered fly ash, coal cinders, pumice, scoria, pelletized aggregate and combinations of the foregoing. Other ordinary aggregates that may be used include but are not limited to basalt, sand, gravel, river sand, river gravel, volcanic sand, volcanic gravel, synthetic sand, and synthetic gravel. [0057] In either of such cases, the total aggregate volume fraction and weight fraction can be accounted for in this manner: 100% = + fLWA2 + . . . fLWAn + fAggl + fAgg2 + . . . fAggm [01 ] [0058] Here the number of types of LWA is from 1-n, and the number of types of ordinary aggregates is 1-m, and the ½ + fAgg values reflect either the weight fraction of that component or its volume fraction, as appropriate. [0059] Moreover, the volume and weight of the total aggregate can be described in the following manner: AggT = LWAi + LWA2 + ... LWAn + Aggi + Aggi + ... LWAm [02] [0060] Here the LWA and AGG values reflect either weight of that component or its volume, as appropriate. In an embodiment of the invention in which there is just one type of LWA and one ordinary aggregate, such as sand, these calculations may be simplified thusly: f LWA + fSand = 100% [03] LWA + Sand = AggT [04] [0061 ] In an embodiment of the invention in which there is just one type of LWA and two ordinary aggregates, such as sand and gravel, these calculations may be simplified thusly: f LWA + fsand + fGra ~ 100% [05] LWA + Sand + Gravel = AggT [06] [0062] Embodiments of the LWC and LWC mixes include cementitious materials. In embodiments of the invention, the LWC and LWC mixes include a hydraulic cement, Portland cement, including a Type I, Type l-P, Type II, Type l/l I (meeting both Types I and II criteria) or Type III Portland cement, fly ash, and silica fume. These cementitious materials undergo a chemical reaction resulting in the formation of bonds with itself and other cementitious materials present, with any aggregate, and with reinforcing materials. [0063] Such exemplary cement types are as defined in ASTM C150, and may be generally described as having the following particulary appropriate uses: Type I (general), Type l-P (blended with a pozzolan, including fly ash), Type IA (air-entraining Type I), Type II (general - with need for moderate sulfate resistance or moderate heat of hydration), Type IIA (air-entraining Type II), Type III (with need for high early strength), and Type IMA (air-entraining Type III). As is known to those of skill in the art, Portland cements are powder compositions produced by grinding Portland cement clinker, a limited amount of calcium sulfate which controls the set time, and up to 5% minor constituents (as allowed by various standards). As is known to those of skill in the art, Portland cements are powder compositions produced by grinding Portland cement clinker, a limited amount of calcium sulfate which controls the set time, and minor constituents (as allowed by various standards). The specific gravity of Portland cement is typically about 3.15. In an embodiment of the invention, the cement includes a HOLCIM brand Type l/ll Portland cement component, in particular HOLCIM St. Genevieve Type l/ll. [0064] Fly ash is a cementitious material that is a byproduct of coal combustion. Pulverized coal is burned in the presence of flame temperatures of to 1500 degrees Celsius. The gaseous inorganic matter cools to a liquid and then solid state, forming individual particles of fly ash. [0065] Types of fly ash include Class C and Class F. Based upon ASTM C618, Class F fly ash contains at least 70% pozzolanic compounds (silica oxide, alumina oxide, and iron oxide), and Class C fly ash contains between 50% and 70% of these compounds. Such fly ash can reduce concrete permeability, with Class F tending to have a proportionately greater effect. Class F fly ash also protects against sulfate attack, alkali silica reaction, corrosion of reinforcement, and chemical attack. The specific gravity of fly ash may range from 2.2 to 2.8. [0066] Fly ash, as a cementitious material reacts with water present in the mix. Fly ash is believed to improve workability of the cement mixture once mixed with water. In addition, use of fly ash holds down manufacturing costs, as it is less expensive by weight than either cement or microspheres. In one embodiment of the invention, BORAL brand Class F Fly Ash is used, with an SG of 2.49. In another embodiment of the invention, MRT Labadie brand Class C Fly Ash is used, with an SG of 2.75. [0067] Silica fume is a cementitious material that is a powdered form of microsilica. Silica fume, as a cementitious material reacts with the calcium hydroxide in the cement paste present in the mix. It is believed to improve strength and durability of the concrete product, by increasing the bonding strength of the cementitious materials in the concrete mix and reducing permability by filling voids in among cement particles and the LWA (such as the glass microspheres). Silica fume can have an SG of around 2.2. In one embodiment of the invention, EUCON brand MSA is used, with an SG of 2.29. [0068] It is believed that the LWA, for example the glass microspheres, used in the present invention may also be reacting with the above cementitious materials in the hydration process. In this case, the amount of cementitious materials considered to be present in a mix should account for that capability. A way to account for it is by evaluating the effective mass of cementitious materials (CM EFF) where that value is experimentally derived to capture the effect of the LWA present in the mix on the workability of the mix and strength of the concrete. If Mc is the mass of the cement, MSF is the mass of the silica fume, and MFA is the mass of the fly ash, and MLWA represents the mass(es) of the one or more LWAs present, and λ is a scaling factor for the effective cementitious mass of that LWA, then a way to express the result is (if for example there are two LWAs present): CMEFF = Mc + MSF + MFA + Al-MLWA1 + A2-MLWA2 [07] [0069] In an embodiment of the invention, the amount of water in the wet mix will depend in many instances on the desired water-to-cement (W/CM) ratio and amount of cement or cementitious materials in the concrete mix. In general, a lower W/CM ratio results in stronger concrete but also in a lower slump value and reduced workability and ability for the wet concrete mix to flow. More water is usually is used in mixing concrete than is required for merely for complete hydration. But thinning the paste reduces its strength. Admixtures can be used to reduce the amount of water needed for workability, but at the cost of increased manufacturing costs due to the expense of the admixtures. Ordinarily, a minimum W/CM ratio is 0.22 to permit sufficient hydration for the concrete to set properly. W/CM ratios can range upward therefrom to about 0.40, from about 0.57-0.62, about 0.68 or above, and at levels ranging between any of the values stated above. W/CM ratios around 0.22, or in the range of about 0.1 5-0.35, ordinarily are present in the case of the manufacture of concrete blocks, with the values for other concrete being higher. A higher W/CM ratio can be tolerated in multiple instances, including when the concrete's design strength and strength-to-weight ratios are higher. A higher ratio is also tolerable in the event the glass microspheres are reacting with cementious materials, allowing for a portion of such glass microspheres to be used in the cementious material calculations, thereby lowering the W/CM ratio. [0070] The W/CM ratio accounts for all water (here potable water), excluding water in any admixtures. This ratio is calculated by dividing the weight of that water by the total weight of all cementitious materials. That ratio can also be calculated by dividing the weight of that water by CMEFF, the effective weight of the cementitious materials. [0071 ] As shown in FIGS. 1A - 1 C, embodiments of the invention could also include LWC 1 including reinforcing materials, such as fiber 2 or steel rod (re-bar) 3 or wire mesh 4, and LWC mixes including reinforcing materials, such as fiber, as well as the processes of preparing and/or batching them. A fundamental function of reinforcing materials is to increase tensile strength and resist tensile stresses in portions of the concrete where cracking as well as other structural failures might otherwise occur. In particular, inclusion of fiber in a concrete mix can help reduce plastic shrinkage and thermal cracking and to improve abrasion resistance, as well as flexural characteristics of concrete products. Fiber is believed to bond with the concrete. [0072] Suitable fibers may include glass fibers, silicon carbide, PVA fibers aramid fibers, polyester, carbon fibers, composite fibers, fiberglass, steel fibers and combinations thereof. The fibers or combinations thereof can be used in a mesh or web structure, intertwined, interwoven, and oriented in any desirable direction, or non- oriented and randomly-distributed in the LWC as shown in FIG. 1A, or LWC mix. In an embodiment of the invention, a short, small diameter, monofilament PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) fiber is used, which meets ASTM C-1116, Section 4.1 .3 (at 1 .0 Ib/cu.yd). A particular example of such fiber is a NYCON brand PVA RECS15, having an 8-denier (38 micron) diameter, 0.375" (8mm) length, about 1 .3 (or 1 .01 ) SG and a tensile strength of 240 kpsi (1600 Mpa) and a flexural strength of 5,700 kpsi (40,000 Mpa). The fiber amount may be adjusted to provide desired properties to the concrete. [0073] A embodiment of the LWC mix may include admixtures to improve the characteristics of the mix and/or the set concrete. Such admixtures include an air entrainment admixture, a de-air entrainer admixture, a superplasticizer (or high range water reducer), a viscosity modifer (or rheology-modifier), a shrinkage reducer, latex, superabsorbent polymers, and a hydration stabilizer (or set retarding admixture). Other admixtures may include colorants, anti-foam agents, dispersing agents, water-proofing agents, set-accelerators, a water-reducer (or set retardant), bonding agents, freezing point decreasing agents, anti-washout admixtures, adhesiveness-improving agents, and air. Usually, admixtures get determined and calculated by a determined amount per 100 lbs of cementitious materials. Such admixtures typically form less than one percent by weight with respect to total weight of the mix (including water), but can be present at from amounts below 0.1 to around 2 or 3 weight percent, or at amounts therebetween. [0074] Exemplary plasticizing agents include, but are not limited to, polyhydroxycarboxylic acids or salts thereof, polycarboxylates or salts thereof; lignosulfonates, polyethylene glycols, and combinations thereof. [0075] A superplasticizer permits concrete production with better workability but with a reduced amount of water, assists in forming flowable and self-compacting concrete. Exemplary superplasticizing agents include alkaline or earth alkaline metal salts of lignin sulfonates; lignosulfonates, alkaline or earth alkaline metal salts of highly condensed naphthalene sulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensates; polynaphthalene sulfonates, alkaline or earth alkaline metal salts of one or more polycarboxylates; alkaline or earth alkaline metal salts of melamine/formaldehyde/sulfite condensates; sulfonic acid esters; carbohydrate esters; and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, EUCON brand SPC is used, which is a polycarboxylate-based superplasticizer. In other embodiment, BASF brand Glenium 7500 is used. [0076] An air entrainment admixture assists in forming small or microscopic air voids in the set concrete that results from a favorable size and spacing of air bubbles in the concrete mix. This helps protect the concrete from freeze/thaw cycle damage. It also improves W/CM ratio, resistance to segregation of compenents, workability, resistance to de-icing salts, sulfates, and corrosive water. An exemplary air entrainment admixture meets ASTM C260. In one embodiment, Euclid Chemical AEA-92 is used. [0077] A de-air entrainer admixture acts to reduce the entrained air (or plastic air content). This helps to mitigate the reduced strength caused by entrained air (i.e. the volume comprising air lacks the strength of cement or aggregate) and also also reduces the need to overdesign the concrete or object due to that decrease in strength. In one embodiment, BASF brand PS 1390 is used. [0078] A viscosity modifier (or rheology-modifying admixture), promotes formation of self-consolidating concrete by modifying the rheology of concrete, specifically by increasing the viscosity of the concrete while still allowing the concrete to flow without segregation of aggregate or other materials in the mix. The increased viscosity permits small particles, including LWA such as the glass microspheres, to remain suspended in the mix, rather than segregating by sinking or floating or rising to the top. An exemplary admixture meets ASTM C494 Type S, and in one embodiment is GRACE brand V-MAR 3 concrete rheology-modifying admixture, in another embodiment is EUCON brand AWA, and in another embodiment is BASF brand MasterMatrix VMA 362. [0079] A shrinkage reducer reduces shrinkage during the curing process by causing the concrete to expand during that process. This induces a compressive stress to offset tensile stresses caused by drying shrinkage. In one embodiment, BASF brand MasterLife SRA 20 is used. Other shrinkage reducers can include calcium oxide (CaO) and calcium sulfo-aluminate ((CaO)4(Al2O3)3(SO3). The latter two are appropriate for use with reinforced concrete. Other examples are Euclid Chemical Conex, which includes calcium oxide (CaO) and EUCON brand SRA-XT, which includes butyl ethers, ether, ethanol, and sodium hydroxide. [0080] Latex increases bonding within the concrete, reduces shrinkages and increases workability and compressive strength. Latex is a polymer, and Euclid Chemical FLEXCON and BASF brand STYROFAN are examples. [0081 ] Superabsorbent polymers can improve curing of the concrete, including by providing internal water curing, that is by serving as an internal reservoir of water that is not part of the mix water (thus keeping water/cement ratio down). That internal water is usable for the curing process to promote curing (and, thus strength) and mitigate against shrinkage (which may induce cracking). Reducing the mix water can also reduce slump during the curing process. Superabsorbent polymers are a form of polymer that can absorb large volumes of water relative to their dry volume, swell, and then reversibly release that water and shrink. Polyacrylic acids are an example. They may be used with lower water/cement ratios (such as below 0.45 or below 0.42 or lower). [0082] A hydration stabilizer (or set retarding admixture) permits concrete production with better predictability by retarding the setting of the concrete to permit time for activities such as mixing, transport, placing and finishing. By reducing the need to add water (thereby decreasing the W/CM ratio) to delay setting during these activities, a water-reducer can improve strength and reduced permeability. An exemplary admixture meets ASTM C494 Type D, and in one embodiment is EUCON brand STASIS, and in another embodiment is BASF brand Delvo. [0083] A water-reducer (or set retardant) permits concrete production with better predictability by retarding the setting of the concrete to permit time for activities such as mixing, transport, placing and finishing. By reducing the need to add water (thus increasing the W/CM ratio) to delay setting during these activities, a water-reducer can improve strength and reduce permeability. Exemplary water reducers include lignosulfonates, sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates, sulfonated melamine-formaldehyde resins, sulfonated vinylcopolynners, urea resins, and salts of hydroxy- or polyhydroxy-carboxylic acids, a 90/10 w/w mixture of polymers of the sodium salt of naphthalene sulfonic acid partially condensed with formaldehyde and sodium gluconate and combinations thereof. An example of a water-reducer is EUCON brand NR. [0084] The concrete composition can include the above components at above any of the lower levels of weight percent indicated in Table II, below any of the higher levels indicated, or at levels within the ranges indicated.

[0087] Total cementitious content is a measure of density of the cementitious materials in the wet mix concrete, and may be measured in pounds per cubic yard. In embodiments of the invention, the total cementitious content ranges from around 660 to around 700 lbs., around 750 lbs. and around 800 lbs, and around 825 lbs. Higher values tend to correlate with higher-strength concretes. In other embodiments, such as those including sand and/or coarse aggregate, the total cementitious content is about 800 lbs. and ranging from around 750 lbs. to around 825 lbs. [0088] The paste content by volume is a percentage measure of the non-aggregate content of the wet mix (including cementitious materials, water, and the plastic air content of that mix). The paste content by volume together with the total volume displaced the aggregates is equal to 100%. In embodiments of the invention, the paste content by volume is about 50%, ranging from 49.1 % to 50.6%, or higher with an increase in density. In other embodiments, such as those including sand and/or coarse aggregate, the paste content by volume is about 40% or about 50% ranging from 35% to 55%, or lower with an increase in density. [0089] The replacement volume of the LWA (VR) is the volume percentage displaced by the LWA in the wet mix, whether it is a single type of LWA or a mix of more than one type. In a mix having no ordinary aggregate (for instance, sand), the replacement volume is the volume percentage displaced by the LWA. In embodiments of the invention, VR may be about 50%, ranging from 49.6% to 53.4%, for mixes with no ordinary aggregate, around 10%, 30% or 40% (as density drops), and ranging from about 10% to about 43%, for mixes including sand, and around 17% or 30-35% (as density drops), and ranging from about 16% to about 37%, for mixes including coarse aggregates (and possibly sand). VR may also be at other levels ranging between any of levels stated above. [0090] Fresh concrete has certain characteristics of interest, including slump, plastic air content, workability and plastic density. [0091 ] Slump is an important measure of the workability of a concrete mix. Slump is a measure of how easily a wet mix flows. Slump is measured in inches, and may be measured according to ASTM C143. Neither particularly high nor particularly low values are inherently preferable. Extremely low-slump applications include the manufacture of concrete blocks and other products. Low-slump applications include circumstances in which early form removal is necessary or desired. Normal-slump applications includes circumstances in which pumpability is critical, such as when concrete must be pumped. In embodiments of the invention, slump ranged from about 5 to almost 40, including values around 5, 6, 8, 22, 25, 28, 32, and 38. [0092] Plastic air content is a measure of the percentage of the volume of the wet mix that constitutes air entrained in the mix, and may be measured according to ASTM C231 . A desirable target plastic air content may range from about 5.0% to 6.5%. In embodiments of the invention, the value ranged from 4.0% to 13.0%. In other embodiments of the invention, the value ranged from 2.4% to 2.8% and even might be as low 2%, 1 % or about 0%. [0093] Plastic density is a measure of the density of the wet mix, and may be measured according to ASTM C138. In embodiments of the invention, the value ranged from around 50 Ib./cu.ft. to around 55 Ib./cu.ft., including about 52 Ib./cu.ft., for lighter weight compositions, and around 70 Ib./cu.ft., including about 69 Ib./cu.ft., 74 Ib./cu.ft., 88 Ib./cu.ft. and 125 Ib./cu.ft, for heavier weight compositions. For embodiments of the invention including coarse aggregrate, such as gravel, the value ranged from around 85 Ib./cu.ft. to around 130 Ib./cu.ft., including about 85 Ib./cu.ft., about 100 Ib./cu.ft. and about 125 Ib./cu.ft. [0094] Cured concrete has many characteristics of interest, including bulk density, oven-dried density, thermal conductivity and insulation value (or R-value), permeable porosity, modulus of rupture, compressive strength, elastic modulus, tensile strength, resistance to fire and combustibility, freeze / thaw resistance, drying shrinkage, chloride ion penetrability, abrasion resistance, the ring test, and CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion). [0095] Compressive strength is a measure of the ability of the concrete to resist compressive loads tending to reduce its size until its failure, and may be measured according to ASTM C39. Higher compressive strength and strength-to-weight are an advantage with the invention because less weight reduces costs. This is the case, for example, in applications such as transportation and dead loads. Concrete compressive strength increases as the concrete ages, at least up to a point, and the hydration process (the chemical reaction within the cementitious materials) continues. Tests may be carried out at, for instance, 3, 4, 7, 14, and 28 days or even longer, as well as at other intervals. In embodiments of the invention, the measured values ranged as follows: 3-day: about 1100, about 1300, about 1700, about 2200 psi, about 2300 psi, about 3800 psi, about 2900 psi, about 4400 psi, and about 5000 psi; 4-day: about 1900 psi; 7-day: about 1300, about 1400, about 1600, about 1900, about 2600 and about 2750 psi, about 4400 psi, about 3200 psi, about 5100 psi, about 6000 psi, about 4700 psi; 10-day: about 3100 psi, about 4800 psi; 14-day: about 3000 psi; 28-day: about 2500 psi, about 2800, about 3300, about 4000, about 3400 psi, about 1770 psi, about 1750 psi, about 3800 psi, about 7000 psi, about 5100 psi. [0096] Elastic modulus is a measure of the concrete's tendency to be deformed elastically when a force is applied to it, and may be measured according to ASTM 649. Like compressive strength, elastic modulus increases as the concrete ages. Tests may be carried out at, for instance, 3, 7 and 28 days or even longer or at other intervals. In embodiments of the invention, the measured values ranged as follows: 3-day: about 400, about 500, about 650, about 850, about 1350, 2100 and about 3400 kpsi; 7-day: about 500, about 550, about 600, about 650, about 800, about 900, about 1400, about 2300 and about 3500 kpsi; 10-day: about 1400 and 2900 kpsi; 14-day: about 800 kpsi; 28-day: about 800, about 850, about 900, about 600, about 700, about 1100, about 550, about 1600, about 2400 and about 4200 kpsi. [0097] Tensile strength, or ultimate tensile strength, is a measure of the maximum stress that the concrete can withstand while being stretched or pulled before failing or breaking, and may be measured by ASTM C496. Like compressive strength, tensile strength increases as the concrete ages. Tests may be carried out at, for instance, 3, 7 and 28 days or even longer or at other intervals. In embodiments of the invention, the measured values ranged as follows: 3-day: about 130, about 140, about 160, about 200, about 230, about 300, about 320, about 420 and about 530 psi; 7-day: about 180, about 200, about 230, about 240, about 300, about 330, about 460, about 365 and about 640 psi; 14-day: about 360 psi; 28-day: about 260, about 235, about 260, about 300, about 340, about 420, about 390, about 480, and about 620 psi. [0098] Modulus of rupture (or flexural strength) is a measure of the concrete's ability to resist deformation under load, and may be measured according to ASTM C78. In embodiments of the invention, the measured values at 28 days ranged as follows: about 300, about 330, about 350, about 270, about 41 0, about 450, about 61 0, and about 91 0 psi. [0099] Oven-dried density is a measure of the density of a structural lightweight concrete, and may be measured according to ASTM C567. In embodiments of the invention, the measured values ranged as follows: about 36, and from about 39 to 42 Ib/cu.ft, and about 55-60 lb/cu.ft., as well as about 75-80 lb/cu.ft., about 1 00 lb/cu.ft., and about 120 Ib/cu.ft. Oven-dried densities of from about 35 to about 1 20 Ib./cu.ft,, below 35, between about 35 and about 40, below 40, below 45 Ib/cu.ft., about 60, about 70, about about 80 Ib/cu.ft., about 90, about 1 00, and about 1 20 Ib/cu.ft.may all be useful. [01 00] R-value is a measure of the insulating effect of a material. Where thickness (T) is in inches, and thermal conductivity CT is in (Btu-in.)/(hr-°F-sq.ft), R-value is defined as T / CT. Ct and R-value each have a non-linear relationship with the oven-dried density of concrete; the relationship is an inverse one for R-value. This relationship is depicted in FIG. 2, which displays the approximate thermal resistance (in R-value) for oven-dried concretes at 4", 5" and 6" thickness. R-value may be influence by actual moisture content and the thermal conductivity of the material used in the concrete. For concrete blocks (concrete masonry units) the R-values are about: 4" block: 0.80; 8" block: 1 .1 1 ; 1 2" block: 1 .28. For ordinary concrete the R-values are (at the listed density, in Ib/cu.ft.) at 1 " thickness: 60: 0.52; 70: 0.42; 80: 0.33; 90: 0.26; 1 00: 0.21 ; 120: 0.1 3. R-value for embodiments of the invention, based upon measured and expected oven-dry density, are expected to be (at the listed density, in Ib/cu.ft.) at 1 " thickness: 40: 1 .06; 60: 0.75; 70: 0.56; 90: 0.43; 100: 0.37; 11 0: 0.25. [01 01 ] Bulk density may be measured according to ASTM 642. The permeable pores percentage may be measured according to ASTM 642. The resistance to fire may be measured according to ASTM E136. The combustibility may be measured according to ASTM E119. [0102] Freeze / thaw resistance may be measured according to ASTM C666, and is a measure of the concrete's resistance to cracking as a result of enduring freeze / thaw cycling. [0103] Drying shrinkage may be measured according to ASTM C157, and is a measure of the percentage of volumetric reduction in size caused by the drop of the amount of water in the concrete as it dries. It can be measured as 'moist' at 7 days, and as 'dry' at 28 days. [0104] Chloride ion penetrability may be measured according to ASTM C1202, and is a measure of the ability of the concrete to resist ions of chloride to penetrate. In embodiments of the invention, the measured values ranged as follows (in coulumbs): about 133 to 283. [0105] Abrasion resistance may be measured according to ASTM C779, and is a measure of the ability of the concrete's surface to resist damage from abrasion. In embodiments of the invention, the measured values ranged as follows (in inches): about 0.032 to 0.036. [0106] The ring test may be measured according to ASTM C1581 , and is a measure of the ability of the concrete to resist nonstructural cracking. In embodiments of the invention, the measured values ranged as follows (in days): about 10.1 to 16.2. [0107] CTE is the coefficient of thermal expansion and may be measured according to AASHTO T 336. In one embodiment of the invention, the measured value was (in in./in./°F): 5.70 x 10-6. [0108] To further illustrate various illustrative embodiments of the present invention, the following examples of concretes made and test results and measurements therefrom are provided. EXAMPLES Examples 1-7 Aggregate: SG 0.35 microspheres [0109] Concrete preparation and mixing was done in accordance with ASTM C192. The process is described in reference to FIGS. 3A-3B. First, all necessary equipment was prepared in step 100. Then the dry ingredients were weighed and thereafter the liquid ingredients (steps 105 and 110). All weights for Examples 1 -7 are shown below in Table III (by weight) and Table IV (by weight percent). Paste content for Example 7 was estimated. Admixture amounts are fluid ounces per 100 lbs. of cementitious material. Then in step 115, all of the LWA was placed into the mixing pan 7 of a Hobart type pan mixer 6 (see FIG 5B). This LWA was composed of 3M brand S35 glass microspheres having a SG of about 0.35, a median size of about 40 microns and a microsphere size distribution such that about 80% are between about 10-75 microns, and with about a crushing strength 90% survival rate at about 3000 psi. Then, if the mix included an air entrainment admixture, the air entrainment admixture was added in step 120 together with about 80% of the water by weight to the lightweight aggregate in mixer 6. The air entrainment admixture was Euclid Chemical AEA-92. If the mix did not, about 80% of the water by weight was added in step 125 to the lightweight aggregate in mixer 6. In step 130, while adding water, mixer 6 was run slowly at first, and then on full once enough of the water had mixed with the LWA to reduce dust formation. Mixer 6 is then run until stopped (step 135). Thereafter, the fibers were added to mixer 6 in step 140. The fibers were NYCON brand PVA RECS15 8mm fibers. Mixer 6 was run for about a minute in step 145. As there is no sand or coarse aggregates in these mixes, in step 160 the cementitious materials and remaining admixtures (as listed on Table III) were added with the remaining (about 20%) water. The cementitious materials were HOLCIM brand Type l/l I cement, BORAL brand Class F fly ash and EUCON brand MSA silica fume. In steps 170 and 180, mixer 6 was run for about 3 minutes and thereafter, mixer 6 was stopped to permit the mix to rest for about 3 minutes. While mixer 6 was not running in step 190, mixer blades (paddles) 10 were cleaned off. Mixer 6 was run for about 2 minutes in step 200. At this point, the mix was tested in step 210 for compliance with target slump and target measured air indicated in Table III as target values after any adjustments, if any. If a mix did not comply, such mix was adjusted as required in step 220 to meet target slump and target measured air. If the measured air was too high, de-air entrainment admixture was added in step 225. If a mix was adjusted, then mixer 6 was run in step 230 for about 2 minutes, and the mix was again tested (see step 210) for compliance with target slump and target measured air. If it did not comply, the steps above were repeated. If a mix did comply, then the process of preparing the batch, mixing the batched materials, and forming the wet concrete mix was complete (step 240). Table III: Mix / A2 B2 B3 B9 B10 B10 B12 Ex.

Then the dry ingredients were weighed and thereafter, the liquid ingredients (steps 105 and 110). All weights for Examples 8-12 are shown below in Table VIII (by weight) and Table IX (by weight percent). Admixture amounts are fluid ounces per 100 lbs. of cementitious material.

The cementitious materials were HOLCIM brand Type l/ll cement, BORAL brand Class F fly ash and EUCON brand MSA silica fume. In steps 170 and 180, mixer 6 was run for about 3 minutes and thereafter, mixer 6 was stopped to permit the mix to rest for about 3 minutes. While mixer 6 was not running in step 190, the mixer blades (paddles) 10 were cleaned off. Mixer 6 was run for about 2 minutes in step 200.

The process is described in reference to FIGS. 3A-3B. First, all necessary equipment was prepared in step 100. Then the dry ingredients were weighed and thereafter the liquid ingredients (steps 105 and 110). All weights for Examples 13-17 are shown below in Table XIII (by weight) and Table XIV (by weight percent). Admixture amounts are fluid ounces per 100 lbs. of cementitious material. Then, in step 115, all of the LWA was placed into mixing pan 7 of a Hobart type pan mixer 6 (see FIG. 5B). For Example 13, this LWA was composed of 3M brand S15 glass microspheres having a SG of about 0.15, a median size of about 55 microns and a microsphere size distribution such that about 80% are between about 25-90 microns, and with about a 90% crushing strength survival rate at about 300 psi. For the remaining examples, this LWA was composed of 3M brand S35 glass microspheres having a SG of about 0.35, a median size of about 40 microns and a microsphere size distribution such that about 80% are between about 10-75 microns, and with about a crushing strength 90% survival rate at about 3000 psi. Then, if the mix included an air entrainment admixure, the air entrainment admixture was added in step 120 together with about 80% of the water by weight to the lightweight aggregate in mixer 6. The air entrainment admixture was Euclid Chemical AEA-92. If the mix did not, about 80% of the water by weight was added in step 125 to the lightweight aggregate in mixer 6. In step 130, while adding water, mixer 6 was run slowly at first, and then on full once enough of the water had mixed with the LWA to reduce dust formation. Mixer 6 is then run until stopped (step 135). Thereafter, the fibers were added to mixer 6 in step 140. The fibers were NYCON brand PVA RECS15 8mm fibers. Mixer 6 was run for about a minute in step 145. These mixes include sand but no coarse aggregates, so in step 150 the sand was added, followed by step 160, adding cementitious materials and remaining admixtures (as shown in Table XIII) with the remaining (about 20%) water. The cementitious materials were HOLCIM brand Type l/ll cement, BORAL brand Class F fly ash and EUCON brand MSA silica fume. The other aggregate was Meyer McHenry sand. In steps 170 and 180, mixer 6 was run for about 3 minutes and thereafter, mixer 6 was stopped to permit the mix to rest for about 3 minutes. While mixer 6 was not running, in step 190, the mixer blades (paddles) 10 were cleaned off. Mixer 6 was run for about 2 minutes in step 200. At this point, the mix was tested in step 210 for compliance with target slump and target measured air indicated in Table IX as target values after any adjustments, if any. If a mix did not comply, such mix was adjusted as required in step 220 to meet target slump and target measured air. If the measured air was too high, de-air entrainment admixture was added in step. 225. If a mix was adjusted, then mixer 6 was run in step 230 for about 2 minutes, and the mix was again tested (see step 210) for compliance with target slump and target measured air. If it did not comply, the steps above were repeated. If a mix did comply, then the process of preparing the batch, mixing the batched materials and forming the wet concrete mix was complete (step 240). Table XIII: Table XIV: F1 G1 Mix / Ex.

The process is described in reference to FIGS. 3A-3B. First, all necessary equipment was prepared in step 100. Then the dry ingredients were weighed and thereafter the liquid ingredients (steps 105 and 110). All weights for Examples 18-22 are shown below in Table XVIII (by weight) and Table XIX (by weight percent). Admixture amounts are fluid ounces per 100 lbs. of cementitious material.

These mixes include coarse aggregates and some include sand, so in step 150 the sand was added if in the mix design, and in step 155 the coarse aggregate was added, followed by step 160, adding cementitious materials and remaining admixtures (as shown in Table XVIII) with the remaining (about 20%) water. The cementitious materials were HOLCIM brand Type l/ll cement, BORAL brand Class F fly ash and EUCON brand MSA silica fume. The other aggregates were Meyer McHenry sand and Vulcan McCook CM-11 and Martin Marietta #8 coarse aggregates. In steps 170 and 180, mixer 6 was run for about 3 minutes and thereafter, mixer 6 was stopped to permit the mix to rest for about 3 minutes. While mixer 6 was not running, in step 190, the mixer blades (paddles) 10 were cleaned off. Mixer 6 was run for about 2 minutes in step 200. At this point, the mix was tested in step 210 for compliance with target slump and target measured air indicated in Table XII as target values after any adjustments, if any.

Accordingly, based upon predictions relying upon the experimentally-determined values, one may estimate a range of compressive strength values expected for a variety of concrete mixes that may or may not include such an admixture. These are found in Table XXIII below. Table XXIII: [0122] An embodiment of the invention may be prepared as a dry mix, such as for a bagged concrete mix. A bagging facility acquires bags and concrete precursor materials including cementitious materials, aggregates, dry admixtures, and reinforcing materials. Materials may be purchased or extracted. The precursor materials are prepared, including with any pre-mixing such as of dry admixtures. The precursor materials are blended in a continuous process. The dry mix is then bagged. As shown in FIG. 4, these steps include steps 300 and 310, acquire bags and any necessary Portland cement, class F fly ash, silica fume, sand, glass microspheres, dry admixtures, and reinforcing materials. If necessary, step 320 is to prepare cementitious materials, aggregates, dry admixtures, and reinforcing materials for blending, In step 325, carry out any necessary pre-mixing of the acquire materials. In step 330, blend all necessary materials in a continuous process. In step 340, place blended dry mix into bags, and 350 seal the bags. [0123] Different technologies are available for mixing concrete. In all cases, a concrete mixer (or sometimes, "cement mixer") is a device that homogeneously combines the materials being mixed, such as cementitious materials, aggregate, water, and any other additives or reinforcing materials, to form a concrete mix. In embodiments of the invention, there are both stationary and mobile concrete mixers. [0124] Turning to FIGS. 5A - 5B, among the former, there are twin-shaft mixers, vertical axis mixers, which includes both pan mixers 6 and planetary (or counter- current) mixers, and which typically is used for batches between about 1 -4 cu.yd., and drum mixers 12 (which includes both reversing drum mixers and tilting drum mixers). Drum mixers are suitable for the ready mix market as they are capable of high production speeds and are capable of producing in large volumes (batches between about 4-12 cu.yd. or more). All such mixers are charged for a batch of concrete by pouring the dry and wet components into the pan 7 or drum 13, either while it is stationary or in motion, and in a sequence determined by the concrete design. A motor 8, typically electric or gas/diesel-powered, drives a shaft 9 which directly or indirectly rotates and mixes the concrete mix, typically by paddle 10 or by friction and the material being carried along by the drum or by screw 14 in a drum mixer. In the case of drum mixers, as shown in FIG 5C, the mixed concrete is mixed by truck 15, and delivered, in the same manner as with stationary mixers. Batch plants are example of a drum mixer that is stationary, although components of the plant may be tractor-trailer mounted, transported to a location and assembled for use, and then disassembled and moved. [0125] Turning to FIG. 5C, another form of stationary mixer is the ribbon blender 27 having hopper 28, outlet 29, body 30, blade assembly 31 , ribbon blade 32, shaft 33 and supports 34. Blade assembly 31 is driven by driver 35 (typically electric or gas/diesel- powered) via shaft 33. Such a mixer is charged by pouring the dry and wet components into the hopper 28, either while blade assembly 31 is stationary or in motion, and in a sequence determined by the concrete design. Rotation of blade assembly 31 and thereby ribbon blade 32, causes mixing of the charged materials. [0126] The latter (mobile mixers) includes concrete transport trucks ("cement-mixers" or "in-transit mixers") as shown in FIG. 5D for mixing concrete and transporting it to the construction site. In embodiments of the invention, such trucks 15 have a powered rotating drum 13 the interior of which has a spiral blade 14. Rotating drum 13 in one direction pushes the concrete deeper into drum 13. Drum 13 is rotated in this (the "charging") direction while truck 15 is being charged with concrete, and while the concrete is being transported to the building site. Rotating drum 13 in the other (the "discharge") direction causes the Archimedes screw-type arrangement to discharge or force the concrete out of drum 13 onto chute 16. [0127] Examples of other mixers include: concrete mixing trailer, portable mixers, metered concrete trucks (containing weighed and loaded but unmixed components for mixing and use on-site), V blender, continuous processor, cone screw blenders, screw blenders, double cone blenders, planetary mixers, double planetary, high viscosity mixers, counter-rotating, double and triple shaft, vacuum mixers, high shear rotor stator, dispersion mixers, paddle mixers, jet mixers, mobile mixers, Banbury mixers, and intermix mixers. [0128] In embodiments of the invention, there are two modes of use of a concrete mixing truck: dry-charge-and-transport and pre-mixed transport. In the first mode, truck 15 is charged from a batch plant with the as-yet unmixed components of a concrete mix, including dry materials, water and other additives and/or reinforcements, in a sequence determined by the concrete design, with the rotation of drum 13 mixing the concrete during transport to the destination. In the second mode, truck 15 is charged from a batch plant at a concrete manufacturing plant (or "central mix" plant), with a concrete mix that has already had the dry materials, water and other additives and/or reinforcements added in a sequence determined by the concrete design, and already mixed before loading. In this case, rotation of drum 13 mixing the concrete during transport to the destination maintains the mix's liquid state until delivery. [0129] Once at the delivery or construction site, drum 13 is operated in the discharge direction to force the wet mix onto chutes 16 used to guide the mix directly to the job site. In this case, the job site may include other machines used to move or process the wet mix, such as a concrete placer or paving machine. If the use of chute 16 does not permit the concrete to reach the necessary location, concrete may be discharged into a concrete pump, connected to a flexible hose, or onto a conveyor belt which can be extended some distance (typically ten or more meters). A pump provides the means to move the material to precise locations, multi-floor buildings, and other distance prohibitive locations. Examples of pumps include a mobile concrete pump, which accepts for instance ready mix concrete, delivered by dump truck or concrete mixing truck. Such a mobile pump can place concrete at the desired position during the construction process using a pipe mounted on a movable boom. Another example is a stationary concrete pump, which operates similarly except that the pipe is stationary and mounted primarily vertically up the side of a structure during the construction process to provide concrete at the desired location. [0130] Embodiments of the present invention include different processes for preparing and supplying concrete for end use. [0131 ] In one embodiment, a central-mix facility may prepare and mix the concrete itself. This mix process is described in reference to FIG. 6. Step 400 is acquiring concrete precursor materials including water, cementitious materials, aggregates (including LWAs, sand and gravel), admixtures, and reinforcing materials. This may be done, for example, by purchase or extraction. In step 405, if necessary, the acquired materials are prepared, including any premixing. The individual materials are measured, step 420, typically by weight or volume and, in step 430, formed into batches of individual components. The concrete precursor materials are charged into a concrete mixer (dry, step 440, and water, step 450), typically a drum type, and mixed by operating the drum in step 460. The resultant wet mix may be either used for charging, in step 470, a concrete mixing truck or dump truck, or used on-site, in step 480, by discharging it into a pump or delivery apparatus. A concrete mixing truck 15 or dump truck may be owned or controlled by the central-mix facility or by a third-party. Such a third-party may be a builder or general contractor, or a contractor supplying such a party. In embodiments of the present invention, use on-site may include machinery to place the concrete mix for a structure or building or use of the mix for pre-casting. In embodiments of the invention, on-site use includes forming structural beams, architectural panels, sound barriers, blast walls, stadium seating, trench backfill around piping/conduit, insulated roofing, walls, tilt-wall panels, buildings, communication tower buildings, and many other uses typical of normal concrete. [0132] In one embodiment, a central-mix facility prepares the concrete precursor materials but delivers or provides those materials to another party for mixing. This mix process is also described in reference to FIG. 6. Step 400 is acquiring concrete precursor materials including water, cementitious materials, aggregates (including LWAs, sand and gravel), admixtures, and reinforcing materials. This may be done, for example, by purchase or extraction. In step 405, if necessary, the acquired materials are prepared, including any premixing. The individual materials are measured, step 420, typically by weight or volume, in step 430, and formed into batches of individual components. The concrete precursor materials are then used for charging a concrete mixing truck (dry, step 490, and water, step 500), or pre-measured bags. A concrete mixing truck then performs the mixing of the concrete in step 510, and delivers and discharges it as required in steps 520 and 530. Delivery may include to the site of a building or other structure under construction. Such a concrete mixing truck may be owned or controlled by, for instance, a builder or general contractor, or a contractor supplying such a party. [0133] Turning to FIGS. 7A - 7B, precast concrete is a construction product produced by casting concrete in a reusable mold 20 or "form," curing it in a controlled environment, transporting to the construction site and placing the precast item 21 where needed. This is in contrast to standard concrete manufacturing in which the wet mix is poured into site-specific forms 22 in-place and cured in-place to create an item 21 . Pre- casting may also involve casting concrete in a reusable mold 20 on-site, curing it in a controlled environment, and transporting it within the construction site to where it is needed. In embodiments of the invention, items 21 made by pre-casting include but are not limited to concrete blocks, structural beams, double-tees, architectural panels, sound barriers, blast walls, tilt-wall panels, electric and light poles, bridge deck panels, fire-proofing applied by spraying, fencing, cement board, concrete roofing tiles, and floating platforms. [0134] In one embodiment of the invention, precast (or "dry cast") manufacture of concrete blocks involves providing extremely low-slump concrete (almost zero), with a low W/CM ratio (about 0.22 or lower). LWC mixes described herein that do not include coarse aggregate would be expected to be acceptable for making concrete blocks, with the modifications of removing admixtures and reducing water to form to extremely low- slump concrete (almost zero), with a low W/CM ratio (about 0.22). An admixture could be used as a wetting agent for form removal. [0135] The mixing process steps are, as shown in FIG. 8A and with reference to FIG. 5C, is to first prepare equipment in step 600, and then, in steps 605 and 610, weigh any dry ingredients and liquid ingredients. In step 615, place all lightweight aggregate into hopper 28 of ribbon blender 27, while it is running. Then, in steps 620 and 625, place all cement and all water into hopper 28 of ribbon blender 27, while it is running. Then, in step 630, run ribbon blender 27 for about an additional minute. [0136] As shown in FIG. 8A and with reference to FIG. 8B, the LWC mix may be conveyed to block machine 40 at a measured flow rate in step 635 and placed into a reusable mold 41 for a concrete block in step 640. Mold 41 includes outer mold box 42 into which the LWC mix is place and one or more mold liners 43. Liners 43 determine the outer shape of the block and the inner shape of the block cavities. Such molds may be used for form different sizes and shapes of concrete blocks, such as those having 4", 8" or 12" thickness, or having two or three "cores" 44 (i.e. the hollow portion) or no core (i.e. solid blocks). Said shapes need not be rectangular, and can be curved or irregular, and liner 43 may form one block or multiple blocks having the same shape or having shapes differing from one another in the same liner. If required, in step 645, one or more mold liners 43 are inserted into the LWC mix inside of outer mold box 42 to form cores 44. In step 650, the concrete mix in mold 41 is subjected to high compression and vibration. However, the vibration required may be lower than ordinary concrete mixes. Due to the low slump, compression and vibration, block 45 is quickly able to stand unsupported. Following sufficient compression and vibration mold 41 is removed (or stripped) by withdrawing mold liners 43 (if required, in step 655) and removing outer mold box 42 in step 660. Blocks 45 are pushed down and out of the molds. And block 45 is then set aside for curing in step 665, following which the block may be transported to a construction site or sold for further sale. Curing may include steam-curing or other processes to develop desirable concrete properties. [0137] Example 23, and test results for compressive strength, and exemplary ranges in Example 24 of such a concrete are shown in Table XXIV: Table XXIV: [0138] The structural concrete blocks made met or exceeded design strengths. [0139] Values for R-value (a measure of the insulating effect of a material) were established by testing thermal conductivity of two specimens of a LWC per ASTM C177. The specimens were formed from a LWC mix according to Example 5. The specimens were (L/W/T in in.) 11 .97 x 12.04 x 2.05 and 11 .93 x 12.03 x 2.04, and had, respectively a dry density (in Ib/cu.ft.) of 41 .0 and 40.9. Thermal conductivity CT (in (Btu-in.)/(hr-°F- sq.ft)) was 1 .15. Calculated R-value results are presented below in Table XXV. Table XXV: [0140] In one embodiment, a bagging facility prepares the concrete precursor materials for bagging and delivery and/or sale of bagged dry concrete (blended or mixed). These steps include acquiring bags and concrete precursor materials including cementitious materials, aggregates, dry admixtures, and reinforcing materials. This may be done, for example, by purchase or extraction. A continuous process is used, in which the individual materials are measured by weight, blended, deposited into bags, which are sealed, and then sold and/or provided for sale. See FIG. 4. [0141 ] Another embodiment of the invention is a concrete mix (and the corresponding concrete) in which the measured entrained air is very low, including levels of below about 4%, about 3%, about 2%, about 1 % and about 0%, as measured following substantially complete mixing. Commonly, air is allowed to be, or is intentionally, entrained during mixing to volumetrically expand the concrete mix. This has beneficial effects of creating a larger volume of concrete and may improve other characteristics such as resistance to cracks and freeze/thaw cycle damage, W/CM ratio, resistance to segregation of components, workability, as well as resistance to de-icing salts, sulfates, and corrosive water. Adding entrained air, however, also results in a drop in strength of the cured concrete. This may result in the concrete mix having to be designed for a higher strength to compensate, resulting in extra material costs (e.g. cement and admixtures). In addition, once a concrete is mixed to have a design plasic air content, that level of entrained air can drop as a result of activities associated with the use of the mix, such as pumping (in which increased pressure on the mix forces out entrained air) and delays resulting from transportation or awaiting use of the mix. This results in a loss of design volume that can reduce the beneficial effects of the designed levels of entrained air and reduce profitability. Thus a design mix may have to use an elevated level of entrained air to overcome these concerns. In an embodiment of the invention, a closed-cell and non-absorptive particle, is suitable for displacing a volume within the mix to provide the advantage of the entrained air without the disadvantages. Also advantageous are particles that are dimensionally stable and that substantially resist change of volume under pressure. That displacement eliminates or reduces the need or utility for entrained air to serve that function. As an example, particles such as glass microspheres serve that function, resulting in a similarly expanded but stronger concrete. Those particles would be expected to form (as VR) about 5%-25% or more of the concrete mix by volume. Other useful ranges of VR may include about 1 %-6%, about 6%-20%, about 6%-15%, and about 8%-12%. In this embodiment, other aggregates would be likely to be used, including sand and/or coarse aggregates. Low- density microspheres may be preferable, for example those having S.G. 0.125 or 0.15, where the lower strength of such particles would be of lesser concern, or much higher density microspheres, for example those having S.G. of even 0.5 or 0.60 or 0.65, where the higher strength of such particles would be of value such as in concrete having ordinary density, high strength, and which is used in instances where lightweight concrete is not required but crack-resistance is desirable (such as in foundations or roads). Such concrete can be expected to have compressive strengths ranging upward from 3000 psi, to 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 7000, 9000 and 10000 psi and above, as well as at densities greater than 120 Ib./cu.ft. One mix expected to be appropriate, for example, is one having the general proportions of that in Example 21 . Such concrete mixes could be expected to be prepared in accordance with the steps set forth in FIGS. 3A-3B, and products or structures made therefrom in accordance with the steps set forth above. [0142] LWC mixes according to embodiments of the invention may also be used to form concrete roofing tiles, which may take various forms. Concrete roofing tiles are useful as they are hail-resistant and fire-proof, and provide good insulation. However, a roof composed of ordinary concrete roofing tiles is substantially heavier than the shingle / composition roof that is usually originally provided, and for which homes are typically designed to support. Concrete roofing tiles formed of LWC according to embodiments of the invention would be lighter and more readily installed, while still providing other advantages. LWC mixes described herein that do not include coarse aggregate would be expected to be acceptable for making concrete roofing tiles, with the potential modification of removing some or all of the admixtures and by reducing water to form to extremely low-slump concrete (almost zero), with a low W/CM ratio (about 0.22). [0143] The mixing process steps are, as shown in FIG. 8A and with reference to FIG. 5C, with regard to concrete block manufacturing. One method of making concrete roofing tiles is by supplying the LWC mix to the intake of an extruding machine, which extrudes an elongated sheet. A cutting tool cuts the elongated sheet at the appropriate lengths to form the individual concrete roofing tiles. After this, the concrete roofing tiles are set aside for curing, following which they may be transported to a construction site or sold for further sale. Curing may include steam-curing or other processes to develop desirable concrete properties. [0144] LWC mixes according to embodiments of the invention may also be used to form cement board. Cement board is a combination of cement and reinforcing elements, and are typically formed into 4'x8' or 3'x5' sheets of ¼" or ½" thickness or thicker. They are useful as wall elements where moisture resistance, impact-resistance, and/or strength are important. Typical reinforcing elements include cellulose fiber or wood chips. The cement material may also be formed between two layers of a fiberglass mesh or fiberglass mats. Ordinary cement board is, however, relatively heavy and more difficult to cut. Cement board formed of LWC according to embodiments of the invention would be lighter and more readily cut and installed . LWC mixes described herein that do not include coarse aggregate would be expected to be acceptable for making cement board. [0145] The mixing process steps are, as shown in FIG. 8A and with reference to FIG. 5C, with respect to concrete block manufacturing. One method of making cement board is by supplying the LWC mix to the intake of a sheet extruding machine, which extrudes an elongated sheet. A cutting tool cuts the elongated sheet at the appropriate lengths to form the individual sheets of cement board. Thereafter, the cement board sheets are set aside for curing, following which they may be transported to a construction site or sold for further sale. Curing may include steam-curing or other processes to develop desirable concrete properties. [0146] An embodiment of the present invention includes using a LWC composition or dry mix in applying shotcrete. A shotcrete process is one by which a concrete mix is conveyed by pressurization through a hose and pneumatically applied to a surface, while simultaneously being compacted during the application step. Typically, the mix is applied over some form of reinforcements, such as rebar, wire mesh or fibers. There are two variants: dry mix or wet mix. The dry mix process includes providing the dry mix components (e.g. cementious materials, dry admixtures, and LWA) in the respective appropriate ratios, mixing the dry mix components, loading the dry mix components in a storage container, using preumatic pressure to convey the dry materials out of that container and via a hose to a nozzle. At the nozzle, adding and mixing water with the dry materials, while expelling the dry mix and water toward the surface. The wet mix process includes providing the mix components (e.g. water, cementious materials, dry admixtures and LWA) in the respective appropriate ratios, mixing the mix components to form a concrete composition, loading the composition in a storage container, pumping the composition out of that container and via a hose to a nozzle. At the nozzle, using pneumatic pressure to expel the composition toward the surface. [0147] LWC according to embodiments of the invention may be readily cut with an ordinary wood saw, without needing a concrete or stone blade. This is so for those LWC in which all aggregate is LWA as described herein and does not include other ordinary aggregates such as sand. Moreover, a person may easily drive an ordinary nail meant for wood-construction into LWC made according to embodiments of the invention, without needing specially-hardened or carbide-tipped nails, and without needing a nail gun or explosive nail driver and/or drill. Moreover, the surface of a LWC according to embodiments of the invention may be paintable (paint-ready), such as for the interior or exterior of a home, or an architectural panel. Paint-ready, in this instance, requires that a surface be free of voids. [0148] LWC according to embodiments of the invention is expected to have substantially greater insulating properties (higher R-value, lower thermal conductivity) than ordinary concrete. This is based upon the understood relationship between density and conductivity. However, LWC according to embodiments of the invention has a much greater strength-to-weight (and -density) ratio, and thus can insulate better for a given mass and weight. [0149] In this instance, the LWA is much less dense even than water, is the lowest- density component, and has the natural tendency to float to the top of a mix. This has several undesirable consequences. A primary one is that it can cause uneven properties of the concrete product or structure, resulting in visual deficiencies (i.e. visible aggregate maldistribution). Ueven properties might mean a portion of the product or structure having an excessively high concentration of LWA, thus displacing cementitious materials, might be weaker than designed. However, LWC and LWC mixes according to embodiments of the invention have highly-homogenous mix properties, such that the mix density varies by less than 15%, less than 10%, and less than 1 %. That is, mix design largely prevents the LWA from segregating within the mix. This was revealed by pouring a sequence of about seven test samples (according to ASTM C192) from a mix over time, and testing their respective densities (according to ASTM C567). In this case, densities measured were extremely similar, differing among themselves by only about 1 %. [0150] An embodiment of the present invention includes a LWC having a strength-to- weight ratio substantially greater than that typically found in structural LWC, in which the ratio might be (expressed as compressive strength-to-density) about 2500 psi / 90 Ib/cu.ft. (about 27.8) up to about 6000 psi / 120 Ib/cu.ft. (about 50). Embodiments of the present invention include LWC mixes having 28-day compressive strength-to-density ratios about 81 .3 (3310 psi / 40.7 Ib/cu.ft.), about 71 .2 (2800 psi / 39.3 Ib/cu.ft.), about 71 .3 (4000 psi / 56.1 Ib/cu.ft.), about 97.0 (3310 psi / 40.7 Ib/cu.ft), about 48.5 (1770 psi / 36.5 Ib/cu.ft.), about 58.1 (7060 psi / 121 .5 Ib/cu.ft.), and about 48.6 (1750 psi / 36.0 Ib/cu.ft.). Embodiments of the present invention include LWC mixes having 7-day compressive strength-to-density ratios of about 29.8 (3625 psi / 121 .5 Ib/cu.ft.), 40.5 (1580 psi / 39.0 Ib/cu.ft.), 31 .2 (1890 psi / 60.5 Ib/cu.ft.), 50.6 (2757 psi / 54.5 Ib/cu.ft.), 62.4 (2427 psi / 40.5 Ib/cu.ft.). This ratio may also be calculated using tensile strength values or elastic modulus or modulus of rupture This ratio is preferably calculated using strengths or moduli from tests at 28 days or longer, but may also be calculated using tests carried out earlier in the curing process. Such ratios calculated using 28-day values are expected to be better, as the strength values can be expected to increase with age. [0151 ] An embodiment of the present invention includes a LWC having a high strength-replacement-volume factor ("Sv"). This value is calculated by multiplying the compressive or tensile strength by the replacement volume of the LWA (VR, volume percentage displaced by the LWA in the wet mix). Or it may be calculated by multiplying the elastic modulus or modulus of rupture by VR. This is a measure of strength of the concrete combined with the density-reducing effect reflected by VR, in which a higher value is better. In embodiments of the invention, Svc (based upon 28-day compressive strengths) ranges from about 870 to about 2000 psi, and includes these values: 1678, 1754, 1422 and 2010 psi (mixes in which the only aggregate is a LWA comprising glass microspheres) and from about 270 to about 1000 to about 1770 psi, and includes these values: 268, 1003, 1615, and 1771 psi (mixes in which either or both sand and a coarse aggregate were present in addition to a LWA comprising glass microspheres). In embodiments of the invention, SVT (based upon 7-day tensile strengths) ranges from about 90 to about 115, and includes these values: 89.5, 101 .8, 114.5, 94.32 psi (the first three being mixes in which the only aggregate is a LWA comprising glass microspheres). In embodiments of the invention, SVT (based upon 28-day tensile strengths) ranges from about 120 to about 180 psi, and includes these values: 118, 136.2, 156.5, and 180.7 psi (mixes in which the only aggregate is a LWA comprising glass microspheres) and from about 20 to about 175 psi, and includes these values: 23.8, 112.1 , 153.5, and 176.7 psi (mixes in which either or both sand and a coarse aggregate were present in addition to a LWA comprising glass microspheres). In embodiments of the invention, SVA (based upon the 28-day elastic modulus) ranges from about 270 to about 460 kpsi, and includes these values: 273.9, 344.5, 421 .6, 405.6, and 458.1 kpsi (mixes in which the only aggregate is a LWA comprising glass microspheres) and from about 160 to about 770 kpsi, and includes these values: 158.7, 373.8, 462.8, 598.1 , and 767.3 kpsi (mixes in which either or both sand and a coarse aggregate were present in addition to a LWA comprising glass microspheres). In embodiments of the invention, SVA (based upon the 7-day elastic modulus) ranges from about 250 to about 315 kpsi, and includes these values: 248.5, 254.5, 273.9 and 314.4 kpsi (the first three being mixes in which the only aggregate is a LWA comprising glass microspheres). This factor is preferably calculated using strengths or moduli from tests at 28 days or longer, but may also be calculated using tests carried out earlier in the curing process. [0152] An embodiment of the present invention includes a LWC mix having a low weight-fraction of aggregate to total dry raw materials (FAD). This is a measure of the density-reducing effect of using the embodiments of the LWA as described above, and in particular the lower-density glass microspheres such as the SG 0.15 microspheres. FAD ranges from about 10 to about 75, and includes these values: 30.32, 29.74%, 29.71 %, 30.01 %, 30.06%, 13.95%, 14.37%, and 13.85% (mixes in which the only aggregate is a LWA comprising glass microspheres; those falling below 15% included SG 0.15 microspheres and less fly ash) as well as 42.08% and 42.06% (each mixes in which sand is included in the aggregate with a LWA comprising glass microspheres). Other mixes with large amounts of sand or gravel had substantially higher values. [0153] An embodiment of the present invention includes a dry LWC mix having a a low weight-fraction of aggregate to total dry raw materials, and highly-homogenous mix properties, and which forms LWC having a low-density, low thermal conductivity, high strength-replacement-volume factor, a high strength-to-weight ratio, and a high strength-to-density ratio.

[0162] The proportions of various components in the tables for Examples 1 -24 are disclosed by weight, but could also be expressed as weight-fractions, weight-percent, volumes, volume-fractions, volume-percent, or relative ratios (e.g., by weight: 1 part water: 1 part cement: 1 .2 parts aggregate).
