FIELD The present invention is directed to a darts game apparatus. BACKGROUND A darts game apparatus so called as a soft dart is well known, in which a dart having a tip of plastic or the like at the leading edge is thrown to a target which is formed with a plurality of holes (pits) made of a resin material such as plastic, and skills are competed by gain points set at respective target portions to which the thrown dart hits. Here, it is significant for the darts game apparatus to provide a situation where players (or competitors) of a darts game can be more enthused about the darts game by displaying a gain point corresponding to the result of throwing the dart, and displaying performance when the gain point exceeds a fixed point. A darts game apparatus corresponding the above situation is an invention described in the patent document 1, which the present applicant has previously proposed. In the game apparatus described in the patent document 1, a target is provided on the front surface of a game housing, and a display unit is provided at an upper portion of the target to display performance when gain points become more than a fixed point. Further, as another technique, displaying of performance is similarly performed on a display unit at the upper portion of the game housing as previously proposed by the applicant, and a dart target board face is divided into a plurality of target segments, each of which is illuminated with different modes so that performance effects are raised. (See patent document 2) Furthermore, in conventional darts game apparatuses, the shape of a target is formed as being divided by a plurality of concentric circles and dividing lines so that a plurality of segments are defined. Therefore, the present applicant further had proposed the configuration such that an image of a dart target is displayed on an image display device, and a transparent panel body, which can hold a tip is provided in front of the display surface of the image display device. (See patent document 3) By this configuration, various modes of the target are obtained according to changes of images displayed on the image display device.

DESCRI PTION OF EMBODIMENTS The embodiments will be explained below according to drawings. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram indicating an outer shape of an embodiment of the darts game apparatus. In Fig. 1, (1) is a front view of the darts game apparatus, and (2) is a side view of the darts game apparatus. The darts game apparatus comprises a tabular main body 1 of an apparatus housing, and at least one projector, which projects an image on the surface of the main body1. In the example indicated in Fig. 1, projectors 2, 3 are provided on both upper and lower portions of the main body 1, but it may be possible to include at least one projector. It is possible to prevent a shadow of a dart, which hits a target and is retained from elongating in one direction by adjusting intensity of lights from the projectors 2,3, as explained in detailed later, by providing the projectors 2, 3 on the both of the upper and lower portions of the main body 1. Fig. 2 is an example of a performance image projected on the surface of the main body 1 by the projector 2, 3. Fig. 2 (1) is an example of that the darts game apparatus displays an advertising screen. An advertising image is projected on the surface of the main body 1 from the projectors 2, 3. As an example, a video indicating results in past darts games is displayed in the areas 4, 5 of the projected image, or performance images telling attraction of the darts game are displayed to attract players during the darts game being not performed. Further, in Fig. 2 (2), when a darts game is started, a projection image 6 is displayed to indicate an area position for detecting data of a card held up, so that game fees are received by a card settlement. The card is held up on the projected image 6, which indicates the detection position of the card data, as indicated in Fig. 2 (1), and player's data (data recorded on a credit card or member's card and the like) are read. Fig. 2 (2) is an example of a projection image when the player's data are read and the darts game is moved to a start mode. A target image 7 for darts, a score board 8 and a plurality of selection button (touch sensor) positions 9 are displayed. Further, Fig. 2 (3) is an example displaying a performance image, when a predetermined score is achieved during the darts game. The target image 7 performs the performance, which celebrates the score achievement by varying display of a plurality of colors. A score of competition results or other messages are displayed on the score board 8. Performance messages are also displayed by an image 10. It should be noted that the target image 7 is not limited as a round shape which used to be standard in conventional darts game apparatuses, but is possible to be freely modified such as a square shape or the like. Here, displaying images projected by the above projectors 2, 3 are performed by employing a projection mapping, which is a well-known technique. The projection mapping is a technology such that unevenness of a building or the like is converted to three dimensional digitized data in advance, and a three dimensional video is projected on the building by a projector. Hence, even the surface of the main body 1 has unevenness, projection is possible in consideration of the unevenness. Fig. 3 is a diagram explaining the structure of the main body 1, which is a housing of the darts game apparatus. In Fig. 3, (1a) and (1b) are diagrams showing the outline of front and side sectional views of the first embodiment of the main body 1. In Fig. 3, (2a) and (2b) are diagrams showing the outline of front and side sectional views of the second embodiment of the main body 1. In Fig. 3, a target unit 20 has a front surface, which can hold tips of darts, and a rear side, on which sensors are provided to detect hit darts. In the case of Fig. 3 (1a), (1b), the target unit 20 has a size as positioned about the center area of the main body 1, while in the case of Fig. 3 (2a), (2b), the target unit 20 has a size as same as the entire of the front surface of the main body 1. It should be noted that a front surface color of the target unit 20 is desired as mono-chromatic color such as light-colored, not affecting on the projected image. A structural example of the target unit 20 is depicted in Fig. 4. The structural example is shown in the case of Fig. 3 (1a), (1b), but is the same even in the case of Fig. 3 (2a), (2b). The target unit 20 comprises a plurality of target segments 21 of the same shape as indicated in Fig. 4 (1). Each of the plurality of target segments 21 comprises a plurality of receiving holes 22, which receive and hold tips of darts as shown in Fig. 4 (2). The target unit 20 is replaceable for each target segment 21. The receiving hole 22 is easy to be deformed and degraded due to plural time collisions by tips of darts, and thus it is important that the target unit 20 is replaceable for each target segment 21. It should be noted that the target unit 20 is configured by a plurality of same shape target segments 21, so that easiness of replacement of the target segment 21 is improved, and loads of an administrator for a darts game apparatus can be reduced, compared with the case of using target segments having different shapes. Fig. 5 is a diagram explaining a receiving hole 22 of the target segment 21, and the explanation will be made by indicating the sectional view of one target segment 21, as easily understood. Fig. 5 (1) indicates the state immediately before the dart hits the target segment 21, and Fig. 5 (2) indicates the state such that the dart 100 is stuck in the target segment 21, and due to the impact thereof, the target segment 21 is displaced toward the rear. Further, Fig. 5 (3) indicates the state such that the target segment 21 returns from the state of Fig. 5 (2) to the position shown in Fig. 5 (3), in the state of the dart 100 being stuck in the target segment 21. As shown in Fig. 5 (1), an elastic body 21 b fixed to a projection 21 a at the rear side of the target segment 21 does not give any pushing force to a sensor sheet 21 c, when the dart 100 is not stuck, and thus, not shown membrane switch provided inside of the sensor sheet 21 c is kept off. Then, as shown in Fig. 5 (2), the dart tip is received in the receiving hole 22 of the target segment 21, when the dart 100 hits the target segment 21, and at the same time, the target segment 21 is displaced to the rear so that the elastic body 21 c strongly pushes the sensor sheet 21 c to turn on contacts of the membrane switch and output a hitting detection signal from the sensor sheet 21 c. Moreover, the segment 21 is returned to an original position by the elastic force of the elastic body 21 b, in the state such that the dart tip, which is the distal portion of the dart 100, is kept in the receiving hole 22, as shown in Fig. 5 (3). Here, a method for detecting the state of the dart hitting the target segment 21 is not limited to the way of employing the sensor sheet 21 c as indicated in Fig. 5. For example, the hitting can be determined according to whether or not the tip of the dart 100 obstructs a light from a light emitting device by using light emitting and receiving devices, or a camera is provided which shoots the target segment 100, and a shot image is processed to determine the hitting. In addition, as another method, it is possible to use a distance sensor, which employs a technique similar to "Kinect" (registered trademark) equipment of Microsoft Corporation, U.S.A. Namely, the distant sensor includes a camera which shoots the target segment 21, a radiant section which radiates infrared rays, and a detection section which detects the infrared rays reflected from the target segment 21 and the dart 100. A virtual three dimensional space is generated based on the captured image data from the camera and the reflected infrared rays detected by the detection section, and distant (depth) information (largeness of Z axis direction) is generated for each pixel of the virtual three dimensional space image in an image angle of view at each certain cycle (one frame). As a result, it is possible to recognize the tip of the dart 100 by connecting coordinate points, sizes of which are small in the Z axis direction, when compared with the distance to the target segment 21. Accordingly, the point at which the largeness of the tip in Z axis direction is consistence with the target segment 21 is the leading end of the tip, and the point to which the dart 100 hits can be obtained from the coordinate of the leading end. In this way, internal switches are unnecessary, when the sensor sheet 21 c shown in Fig. 5 is not used as a method to detect the state of hitting. Hence, freedom of performance is improved, and selection of the target segment 21 becomes free in largeness. Further, it is possible to simplify the structure of the apparatus. Hence, the cost for device components are also reduced. Fig. 6 is a diagram showing an embodiment of a control circuit, which controls the darts game apparatus as explained above. This circuit is provided in the back side space of the main body 1 or in the spaces where the projector 2 is located at an upper position and the projector 3 is located at a lower position. In Fig. 6, the control block 200 is a circuit structure to control performance, and the control block 300 is a circuit structure to control sensors. In Fig. 6 the control block 200 includes projectors 2, 3 provided in the upper and lower portions of the main body 1. The operation in the block 200 is performed by the CPU (1) 202, which executes a control program installed in the ROM 201. The image data to be projected on the main body 1 as explained in Fig. 2 are written in the RAM 203. The image data read out by the CPU (I) 202 from the RAM 203 according to the control program are converted and drawn as video data in the video RAM 204. The video data drawn in the video RAM 204 are sequentially read out and projected by the projectors 2, 3. Here, it is well known that a projected image is distorted when projected by the projectors 2, 3, according to shapes of projection plane. Fig. 7 is a diagram explaining the distortion of projected image according to the shape of the projection plane. For example, the video on the projection plane is distorted as shown in Fig. 7 (2), when an image as shown in Fig. 7 (1) is projected on a spherical surface. Thus, it is possible to make the distortion of the video on the projected plane small, when a distortion compensation process is performed which gives a reverse distortion corresponding to such the distortion on the projected image in advance. Namely, in Fig. 7, an image data is given with a pre-distortion reverse to the distortion of the video on the projected plane of Fig. 7 (2), as shown in Fig. 7 (3), and thereafter, is projected. Hence, a video on the projection plane is given as less distorted video corresponding to Fig. 7 (1). In fact, when a projection image is generated by a projection mapping, a viewing point and a view screen are supposed, and points, which are lined with equal intervals on the view screen are defined as projection points viewed from the viewing point. Then, an intersecting point at which straight lines connecting the projection points and the viewing point intersects with a screen, that is, the front surface of the main body 1 is considered as projection points projected by the projectors 2, 3. In this way, a projection image without distortion can be obtained by tracing from the viewing point and projecting the projection points by the projectors. Accordingly, as returning to Fig. 6, distortion compensation control circuits 205, 206 are provided correspondingly at the input sites of the projectors 2, 3. In the distortion compensation control circuits 205, 206, viewing points are traced by the projection mapping technique so that the output image data are compensated as corresponding to determined points to be projected, and are input correspondingly to the projectors 2, 3. Here, projection areas by the projectors 2, 3 are not necessary to be fixed. Namely, a target image may be projected on either of areas of the main body 1, if the target unit 20 is provided on the whole surface of the main body 1 as shown in Fig. 3 (2a), (2b). Namely, it is considered as one production effect that a target image is shifted in a timely fashion, and displayed on different positions of the main body 1. Hence, in some cases, positons of the projected target image are biased to the upper portion or lower portion of the main body 1. In these cases, a distortion of a target image projected by one projector becomes larger than a distortion of the target image projected by the other projector. To avoid this inconvenience, in Fig. 6, CPU (I) 202 adaptively controls the amount of distortion compensation correspondingly to the image data in the distortion compensation control circuits 205, 206 corresponding to projectors 2, 3. Now, in the case that a plurality of projectors are used as the present embodiment, it is preferable to provide respective projectors, which respectively project images on the surface of the main body 1 from different directions. Namely, a shadow of the dart 100 is generated and is elongated in one direction, when the dart hits the target segment 21 and is held by the receiving hole 22, if the image is projected on the surface of the main body 1 from the same direction, even in the case of using one projector or a plurality of projectors is employed. That is, there is generated an area where a projected image cannot be displayed. Hence, a game is obstructed, so that a player lacks the ability to concentrate. Accordingly, it is preferable to provide respective projectors, as explained above. Further, in order to make a shadow hardly be generated, it is preferable that projection lights from plural projectors are of almost same strength in respective opposed directions at the position of the target image to be projected. Accordingly, the CPU (I) 202 controls distortion amounts as corresponding to positions of projected target images, and controls projection lights projected by the projector 2 and the projector 3 to be the same strength at target image positions. Next, the control block 300, which controls sensors will be explained in Fig. 6. A card sensor 301, a touch sensor 302, and a sensor sheet 303 are provided as various sensors. The card sensor 301 corresponding to cards such as a magnetic sensor or an RFID sensor is embedded on the surface panel of the main body1 correspondingly to a position indicated by the projection image 6, shown in Fig. 2 (1). Similarly, the touch sensor 302 is formed on the surface panel of the main body 1 correspondingly to the selection button position 9 indicated by the projection image 6, shown in Fig. 2 (2). The sensor sheet 303 corresponds to the sensor sheet 21 c previously explained in Fig. 5. Returning to Fig. 6, sensor outputs obtained by the card sensor 301, the touch sensor 302 and the sensor sheet 303 are input to I/O control board 304. A CPU (II) 305 provided in the control block 300 processes sensor outputs, which are input to the I/O control board 304, according to a control program stored in the ROM 306. Namely, the card sensor 301 recognizes a card held by a player in the state of projecting images in Fig. 2 (1), and the CPU (II) 305 controls a CPU (I) 202 to generate and project a start image (Fig. 2 (2)) of the darts game. When the touch sensor 302 detects that either touch sensor is touched, the CPU (II) 305 notifies the CPU (I) 202 to generate and project a corresponding production image. Further, when the CPU (II) 305 detects the output of the sensor sheet 303, the CPU (II) 305 records, accumulates, and notifies the result thereof to the CPU (II) 305 to generate and project a corresponding production image. In the above explanation, the sensor, which detects a position of a hit dart is explained as present in the main body 1, but the present invention is not restricted to this. For example, it is possible to project the projection light from the projector as sequentially scanned on the surface of the main body 1, and a sensor, which detects a reflection light corresponding to the projection light is provided at the projector, side. Namely, it is possible to detect whether or not a dart is present according to the strength of a reflection light to the projection light. Now, the structure of the darts game apparatus is explained as a single device in Fig. 6, but is not limited this. There is a case wherein skills are competed between plural darts game players. Fig. 8 depicts a conceptual diagram of a darts game apparatus, which is comprised of a plurality of game terminals T1-Tn, having the same configuration as the darts game apparatus as explained in Fig. 6, and being connected to a server SV through a network NW such as an internet or LAN. Each configuration of the plurality of darts game terminals T1-Tn is basically the same as that explained in Fig. 6. Each of the darts game terminals T1-Tn is connected to the network NW via the NW port 308. In the case of such the configuration, it is possible that the plurality of darts game terminals T1-Tn are not controlled to execute by respective CPUs, but the server SV collectively controls game progresses in the plurality of darts game terminals T1-Tn. Further, an effect display for a total system is controlled by the server SV as shown in Fig. 9. For example, in Fig. 9, all surfaces of the plurality of darts game terminals T1-Tn are supposed as one display area to produce a display of a large image 500. In this case, the server SV sends each of corresponding part images to the respective darts game terminals T1-Tn, which respectively display a part of the large image 500. Each of the darts game terminals T1-Tn synchronizes with clocks controlled by the server SV to project image data sent from the server SV by the projectors 2, 3 as explained in Fig. 6, so that a production image generated as a total system is displayed as shown in Fig. 9. As explained above, in the present invention, a large performance display can be possible without enlarging the housing of the darts game apparatus, by entire of the main body 1 of the darts game apparatus being functioned as a display. That is, an effective display was restricted only in a particular portion (for example, upper portion of the housing) in conventional apparatuses, but an entire surface of the housing can be used, so that it is possible to enhance the freedom of effective production by the apparatus according to the present invention. Furthermore, it is not necessary to limit the target of the darts game apparatus to a specific portion, and the shape of the target can be made without limiting to a round shape.
