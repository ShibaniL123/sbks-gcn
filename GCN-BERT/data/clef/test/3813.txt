Synthesis of 5-fluoro-6-[7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl]-N-methylnicotinamide (Compound Example 138)
i. A solution of sulfuric acid (2 ml, 98%) in water (2 ml) and 5-fluoro-6-[7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methylpyrazol-4-yl)-2-oxoimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl]pyridine-3-nitrile (110 mg, 0.26 mmol) were initially introduced in an 8 ml reaction vessel. The mixture was stirred at 80Â° C. overnight. Sodium hydroxide (4 mol/I) was used to adjust the pH to 8. The mixture was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was purified on silica gel with a 0.5% aqueous NH4HCO3 solution and CH3CN (82/18), giving 70 mg (61%) of 5-fluoro-6-[7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methylpyrazol-4-yl)-2-oxoimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl]pyridine-3-carboxylic acid as white solid.
