Botanical classification: Abelia×grandiflora. Varietal denomination: ‘Wevo1’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Abelia×grandiflora and will be referred to hereafter by its cultivar name, ‘Wevo1’. ‘Wevo1’ represents a new Abelia, a semi-evergreen shrub grown for landscape use. The Inventor discovered the new cultivar in June of 2008 as a naturally occurring branch mutation of Abelia×grandiflora ‘Abelops’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 20,961) that was growing in a container at his nursery in Reeuwijk, The Netherlands. Asexual propagation of the new cultivar was first accomplished by stem cuttings by the Inventor in Reeuwijk, The Netherlands in July of 2008. Asexual propagation by stem cuttings has determined that the characteristics of the new cultivar are stable and are reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The following traits have been repeatedly observed and represent the characteristics of the new cultivar. These attributes in combination distinguish ‘Wevo1’ as a unique cultivar of Abelia. 1. ‘Wevo1’ exhibits mature foliage that is variegated with green centers and white margins; the variegation is retained from spring until winter.2. ‘Wevo1’ exhibits white flowers.3. ‘Wevo1’ exhibits a dwarf and upright spreading plant habit; reaching about 1 m in height when mature. ‘Abelops’, the parent plant of ‘Wevo1’, differs from ‘Wevo1’ in having variegated foliage in which the white margin is wider, in having foliage that turns reddish in autumn, and in having flowers that are pinkish white in color. ‘Wevo1’ can also be compared to the cultivars ‘Kaleidoscope’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 16,988), ‘Wevo2’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 24,838) and ‘Raspberry Profusion’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 18,834). ‘Wevo2’ differs from ‘Wevo1’ in having foliage with a much thinner white margin. ‘Kaleidoscope’ differs from ‘Wevo1’ in having variegated foliage with green centers and wide yellow margins early in season with the leaves flushed with orange and red in autumn. ‘Raspberry Profusion’ differs from ‘Wevo1’ in having foliage that is non variegated and in having pink flowers. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The plants and plant parts in the photographs depict a two-year old plant of ‘Wevo1’ as grown in an unheated greenhouse in a 15-cm container in Reeuwijk, The Netherlands. The photograph in FIG. 1 provides a side view of ‘Wevo1’. The photograph in FIG. 2 provides a close-up view of the flowers of ‘Wevo1’. The photograph in FIG. 3 provides a close-up of the foliage of ‘Wevo1’. The colors in the photographs are as close as possible with the photographic and printing technology utilized and the color values cited in the detailed botanical description accurately describe the colors of the new Abelia. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The following is a detailed description of two year-old plants of the new cultivar as grown in an unheated greenhouse in 15-cm containers in Reeuwijk, The Netherlands with average day temperatures ranging from 10° C. to 24° C. and average night temperatures ranging from 2° C. to 14° C. The phenotype of the new cultivar may vary with variations in environmental, climatic, and cultural conditions, as it has not been tested under all possible environmental conditions. The color determination is in accordance with The 2007 R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society, London, England, except where general color terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
