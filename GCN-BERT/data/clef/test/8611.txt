Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-7-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Sodium nitrite (59.8 mg, 0.87 mmol) was added in water (0.2 mL) to a cooled solution of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (370 mg, 0.79 mmol) in propionic acid (2628 μL)/water (526 μL) at −10° C. The reaction was stirred for 1 hour, then ice-cold EtOAc (20 mL) was added. The reaction was quenched by addition of cold saturated NaHCO3 solution and stirred for 15 minutes, before being allowed to warm to room temperature. The layers were separated and the aqueous was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organics were dried and evaporated, then the crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 50% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-7-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (252 mg, 67%) as a beige solid.
