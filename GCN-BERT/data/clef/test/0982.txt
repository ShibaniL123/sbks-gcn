Example 5 : Preparation of 2'-amino-2-(2-aminopyridin-4-yl)-[4,4'-bipyrimidin]-5-ol (XXXIV)
Example 5-1 : Preparation of [4-(4-chloro-5-methoxy-pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyridin-2-yl]-carbamic acid-tert-butyl ester (XXX)
2,4-Dichloro-5-methoxypyrimidine (XXIX) (800 mg, 4.34 mmol) and [4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolan-2-yl)-pyridin-2-yl]-carbamic acid-tert-butyl ester (XXIV) (1.16 g, 3.62 mmol) were dissolved in ethylene glycol dimethyl ester/distilled water (10 ml / 2 ml) solution. Sodium carbonate (1.15 g, 10.86 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) (125.6 mg, 0.109 mmol) were added to the resulting solution and then the solution was stirred with reflux for 18 hrs. After completion of the reaction by addition of water, the solution was extracted with ethylacetate, washed with distilled water, and dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethylacetate = 1/1) to give the brown title compound (302.1 mg, 28.0 %).
