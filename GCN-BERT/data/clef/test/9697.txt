AIR BUBBLING VALVES SYSTEM IN ELECTROLYSIS CELLS THAT DECREASE THE PRODUCTION LOSSES DUE TO BREAKAGE OR PHYSICAL DAMAGES; AND ITS OPERATION METHOD DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS KNOWN IN THE ART The electrolytic deposit of metals from solution is normally done in masonry cells coated with electricity insulating materials, acid or alkali-resistant or temperature resistant. In these cells the fresh electrolyte is fed through one longitudinal end of the Cell while the worn electrolyte is discarded by the bottom opposite longitudinal end if the feeding was done through the upper part or vice-versa. Occasionally the transverse circulation of the electrolyte has been used, i.e. parallel to the faces of the anodes and cathodes with piping with holes located in front of each space inter-anode-cathode, that are placed longitudinally through the bottom at one side of the cell. Through this piping the fresh electrolyte is introduced, while the discharge is done by overflow, or through the other punched piping located at the opposite upper side of the cell. In order to improve the electricity efficiency, to avoid the deposition of metal on the vertical borders of the cathodes, to improve the quality of the cathode deposit and to decrease the production losses due to the cells maintenance, now removable insulating structures are being used with electrode guides to put position anodes and cathodes as disclosed in the Chilean Patent 45288 (application 1020-2004) . With the same previous objectives, air or other gases are often injected to shake the electrolyte and to make its concentration more uniform which helps to prevent the crystallization of the electrolyte and to decrease the effect of the limit layer. This can be done introducing punched tubes at the bottom of the cell through which air or other gases is injected, which requires the use of fans, feeding ducts and the distribution punched pipes. The fact of having pipes with gases sunken in the electrolyte make them tend to float making the fixation systems of the pipes to the cell complex. In recent years, the bubbling of air is done using microporous hoses as a standard of the process since they have the advantage over the punched pipes of allowing a better control of the bubbling characteristics. These microporous hoses like the punched pipes are installed longitudinally on the floor of the cell or next to it, they are normally fed through both ends in order to share the loss of pressure that occurs in the pipes or hoses as the air flows towards the center of the cell. During normal operation, the failure in the air distribution through the air distributors to their microporous hoses, arises from their physical fatigue, either because of material failure, bumps, accidental fall of anodes or cathodes on the pipes, because of the accidental fall of part of a cathode deposit; the breakage due to the stretching by a hook used to remove solids from inside the cell, that by doing it blindly the operation can cause that when rising the hook it tugs some of the microporous hoses (5) shown in Figure 1/7, stretching that also damages the front and the rear distribution heads as shown in Figures 2a/7, 2b/7, 3a/7 and 3b/7. In order to extend the shell life of the microporous hoses as well as of the punched pipes, attempts have been made to physically protect them with coatings of different types without having effectively solved the issues to date. In order to control the gas flow sprayed to a distribution system and provide exit openings in the distributing system in order that the fresh electrolyte currents and spraying gas from said exit opens go in a relatively uniform way through the cathodes of the cell, a method as the one described in the Chilean Patent application 200202154 was developed. Another method to operate a cell that incorporates bubbling gas is described in the Chilean Patent Application 200402120. In the National Search no insulation or protection methods against damages of pipes or microporous hoses of the distribution systems of bubbling gas in electrolytic cells were found. In the International Search, the physical protection for pipes and hoses refer preferably to cover completely those elements with an upper coating like the one disclosed in the Chinese Patent Application CN201593667(U), a lower curved protection to protect the radius of curvature in a horizontal plane, leaving the horizontal diametric plane upwards uncovered as in the Chinese Patent Application CN202040482U, a complete protection of the flexible element (electric conductor or hose) with a corrugated metal coating or a flexible mesh similar to the ones used in the flexible unions used in plumbing to prevent a radial expansion like the one described in the German Patent Application DEI02008049497 (Al) . Another protection method consists of wrapping with a tape made of elastic material and shock absorbent arranged in a spiral on the surface of the hose as disclosed in the German Patent Application DE 10 2009 053092 Α1. Another form of hose protection consists of covering with one or more concentric metal springs arranged in spiral over the hose like the ones used in some connections in automotive hydraulic breaks pipes as disclosed in the Chinese Patent Application CN201925657U. Another way to protect curved hoses is disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application JP2008223940 that covers with one or two moulded circular layers that can be easily separated in fractions.

The operating proce dure for the readjustment of the air or ine rt gas injection lines, starts with the no rmal opera t ion of the plant.

Therefore, in order to quality of the generated cathode deposition, it to adjust the aeration or gas injection lines, keep a constant and uniform bubbling flow. In this, the identification of the line where maintain the is necessary in order to order to do tl ■F auu3 occurred is done and consequently the one through which the air or inert gas leaks. The procedure consists of individually closincr t^0 of valves of each line and leave the othe lines with their valves opened, and make a νisual inspectio t ο determine whn51 her the b ubbling ret ijrns to i.ts norma characteristics regarding the uniformity and size of the bubble. Once the line is identified it is kept with its pair of valves closed and the normal cell electrowinning operation continues. This procedure is repeated each time a line failure is detected or when the bubbling does not exhibit the same characteristics it had at the beginning of the operation. Some traditional ways to carry out this invention are described below. One embodiment of this invention, without thereby losing its generality, is shown in Figure 1/7, which includes eight microporous hoses (5-1) to (5- 8), a front air distributor (2), a rear air distributor (3), and air stopcocks to the front (22a) and rear(22ρ) entrances of the distributors and stopcocks to the front entrance (22a-l) up to (22a-8) and to the rear entrance (22ρ-1) up to (22ρ-8) of each of the hoses (5-1) to (5-8) . When a significant air loss occurs in one of the hoses, its identification is done and then the front and rear stopcocks of the damaged branch are closed, which is done without the need of stopping the operation of the cell. Another embodiment of this invention, is shown in Figures 2b/7 and 3b/7 in which a protective cover is included (4) to protect the valves from bumps or accidental fall of heavy elements or objects used in the electrolytic plants. APPLICATION EXAMPLE In order to prove the usefulness of this invention a pilot quasi-isobaric feeding net was built such as the one shown in Figure 1/7, consisting of a straight grid with 8 microporous hoses . The quasi-isobaric grid is mounted on the structure shown in figure 6/7 which corresponds to a removable insulating structure to position anodes and cathodes. In this structure each hose is inserted in one of the boreholes (In) as can be that go up to its upper part as can be seen in Figure each hose is inserted in one of t he boreh oles (In) as can be seen in F igure 4/7. Once beaded the eight Tiicroporous hoses of the quas i-isobaric feeding net in the boreholes of the supports (14), they are connected t" ο 8 ciuc ;ts of rigid plastic material located at the front end and at the rear er id of the removable insulatinq structure to position anodes and cathodes Each of the rigid plastic material ducts are connected through a ball valve (22a) and (22ρ) to the air distributors (2) and (3) shown in Figure 1/7, located at the front and rear end of the device, subsequently connecting the isobaric feeding to the air general feeding (1) indicated in Figures 1/7, 2a/7 and 2b/7' . Once all the quasi-isobaric air feeding net is mounted on the removable insulating structure to position anodes and cathodes indicated in Figure 6/7 and also partially shown in Figure 5/7, all the set is installed inside the masonry electrolytic cell (10). Once the above is done, the air entrance to the fan of the plant that supplies the bubbling gas was connected, then 61 insoluble anodes and 60 stainless steel cathodes, spaced at 100 mm between cathodes centers, this number is fixed by the distance between the cathodes guides positions (9) of the removable insulating structure to position anodes and cathodes. Then the cell was filled with electrolyte and was connected to the electric power to deposit metal on the cathodes thereby starting the feeding of electrolyte and bubbling gas. The operating conditions were set at 2 volts between anodes and cathodes and electrolyte circulation at 30m/hour and bubbling gas feeding at 15 cum per hour. Then the microporous noses was damaged (5-2) breaking it, followed by the closing of the stopcocks (22δΐ-2) and (22ρ-2) in each end of the broken hose. The flow was kept at 15 cum per hour and the operation pressure of the system changed from 1,090 hectopascals to 1,100 hectopascals of absolute pressure and the bubbling process maintained its quality in terms of bubble size, number of them observed and uniformity of the bubbling. There was no loss of gas through the broken hose after the closing of the corresponding valve which permitted to continue with the operation until it finished despite the failure. process maintained its quality in terms of the size of the bubble, the number of bubbles observed and the uniformity of the bubbling. No gas loss was observed through any of the damaged hoses. operation unt il it finished despite the failure. The procedure was repeated breaking a second hose, (5 - 7 ) and closing the valves (22a-7) and (22ρ- 7) , and the f eeding of bubb1ing ga s flow w a s k e ρ t the same. This time the operat ing pressure was changed from the 1,100 hectopascals to 1, 110 hectopascals of absolute pressure.
