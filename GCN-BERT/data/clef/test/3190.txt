[0017] Figures 2A-B illustrate viewpoints of an embodiment of a blocking airway measuring device. [0018] Figiires 3A-B illustrate viewpoints of an embodiment of a caliper-type airway measuring device. [0019] Figure 4 illustrates a viewpoint of an embodiment of a circumscribing- type airway measuring device. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0020] Disclosed herein are embodiments of devices that can be used for measuring or approximating the size of airways, specifically the dimensions of the lumen of the airways. For example, embodiments of the device can be used to measure dimensions of the airways leading into a person's, or animal's, lungs. However, the disclosed devices can be used to measure other lumens as well, and the particular lumen being measuring is not limiting. Further, the measured dimensions can be, for example, volume, radius, circumference or diameter, though the particular dimensions are not limiting. [0021] In some embodiments, the size variations that can be determined by embodiments of the device can depend on the size of the lumen being measured and the device being measured for. As way of example, for segmented airways, the diameters of the airways can be on the order of about 3mm to about 12mm, and embodiments of the disclosed device can measure to approximately ÷ or - 0.0.5, 0.10, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, or 0.50 mm. In some embodiments, the measurements are a resolution between to device sizes, e.g., a 7mm or 6mm device. Embodiments of the disclosed devices can accurately indicate when an airway is above or below the size of a particular device for proper fitting. The particular dimensions being measured are not limiting. [0022] Typically, airways should be measured before other devices, such as intra- bronchial valves, tracheal tubes, or other devices are inserted into lungs. This measurement should be done prior to the insertion of the intended device in order to reduce the likelihood that an inappropriately-sized device is used in an airway, thus inhibiting or preventing damage to the airway based on too large, or too small, of a device. For example, too large of a device for the diameter of an airway can lead to permanent rupturing or deformation of the airway. [0023] Advantageously, embodiments of the disclosed devices can determine very small differences in the size of airways, which can be difficult, providing a user with accurate sizing data. Certain embodiments can be configured to approximate a size of a target airway within a predetermined size range (e.g., a predetermined diameter range). The sizing data can allow for insertion of further equipment into the airways which may otherwise damage or irritate the airways if the airways were not properly sized. In some embodiments, the disclosed sizing devices can advantageously center themselves in the lumen airway, exert relatively low radial force against the airway wall, and/or provide a method to mechanically measure or gauge the size of the airway. [0024] Certain previous catheters use tangs to indicate when an airway is too big for a device. With flexible tangs of different heights away from the center of a catheter, the operator can determine if the airway is in a certain range of diameters. Other devices use an expanding triangle configuration. These devices use a catheter that has a pull wire, which, when pulled back, expands two opposing members. When the members touch the wall of the airway, the user can read the diameter off of the handle, [0025] However, the airway wails can have varying degrees of compliance and mechanical sizing tools can displace the walls leading to measurement error, which can lead to the use of an improperly sized medical device, a problem that is common in the prior art. Further, tools that do not self-center can erroneously measure a cross- sectional chord rather than an actual diameter of the airway lumen. Moreover, some airways are not cylindrical, but can be tapered along the length or non-circular in cross section, leading to incorrect measurements. Thus, there are significant disadvantages to the airway lumen measuring devices that are currently being used. Sizing Device [0026] Disclosed herein are embodiments of sizing, or measuring, devices for measuring airways and airway lumens leading to lungs. In some embodiments, the sizing device can measure or approximate small to large variations in the size of airways, for example those leading to lungs. In some embodiments, these devices can be inserted directly into the airways in order to internally measure the size of the airways with little or no deforming, irritating, or damaging of the airways themselves. Embodiments of the sizing devices can center themselves within the lumen, providing a more accurate reading. In some embodiments, an endoscope, or other visual means, can be used to view the measurement device when inserted into the lung airways to determine the inner diameter of the lung airways. In some embodiments, the size of the airways can be determined after removal and review of the sizing device. [0027] In some embodiments, the below discussed sizing devices can be formed of a biocompatible material, such as nitinol, titanium, or steel. However, other materials, such as pol mers, plastics, metals, and ceramics, can be used as well and the particular material is not limiting. [0028] While ihe below disclosure discusses mainly manual methods for adjusting the measuremeni device, electronic, automated, or other methods of operating ihe measurement devices can be used as well and the methodology for insertion and expansion of the measurement device is not limiting. Whisker Sizing Device [0029] Figures 1A-D show an embodiment of an endoluminal sizing device 100 composed generally of a shaft 102 and a size determining portion 104. [0030] In some embodiments, the shaft 102 and the size determining portion 104 can be integrally formed. In some embodiments, they may be separately formed and attached to one another through, for example, mechanical, adhesive, or chemical means. The attachment of the shaft 1 2 and size determining portion 104 is not limiting. In some embodiments, the size determining portion 104 may be removable from the shaft 102. [0031] The size determining portion 104 can be configured to deploy, as further described in detail below, inside the lumen of an airway upon insertion of the device 100. In some embodiments, the size determining portion 104 may not deploy until it reaches a desired position in the airway lumen. For example, in some embodiments a sheath can be used which can at least partially, or fully, house the size determining portion 104 and/or the shaft 102. The sheath can prevent expansion of the size determining portion 104 until it is properly position. In some embodiments, a shaft 102 housed in the sheath can be pushed away from the sheath to allow insertion-then- expansion of the size determining portion 164 inside the lumen. In some embodiments, a sheath is withdrawn from the shaft 102 to deploy the size determining portion 104. However, other means for prevention of expansion of the size determining portion can be used as well, such as a catheter, working channel of a bronchoscope or endoscope, or other sheath-like device, and the particular means is not limiting. [0832] In some embodiments, the shaft 102 can be formed as a generally cylindrical/rod-like shape having a distal end 122 and proximal end 124. However, the shaft 102 can have other shapes and dimensions as well, and the shape of the shaft 182 is not limiting. If other shapes are used, such as squares or triangles, the edges of the shaft 1 2 can be rounded in order to prevent any irritation of the airway. In some embodiments, the shaft 102 can be relatively rigid. In some embodiments, the shaft 102 can be generally flexible. The rigidity of the shaft is not limiting. The shaft 102 can be used to move the size determining portion 104 into, through, and back out of the airways leading to the lungs. In some embodiments, the shaft 102 can be made of generally biocompatible material, though the type of material is not limiting. [0833] As mentioned, the size determining portion 104 can be attached to the shaft 1 2 in order to move the size determining portion 1 4 through the airway lumens. For example, the size determining portion 184 can be attached near the distal end 122 of the shaft 102 as shown in Figure 1A. In some embodiments, the size determining portion 104 can be located generally centered on the shaft 102. Further, as shown in Figure 1A, the size determining portion 104 can include an aperture 126 configured to fit around the shaft 182. The aperture 126 can include a connection means to attach the size determining portion 104 to the shaft 102. [0034] In some embodiments, the size determining portion 104 can comprise a hub 110, which may include the aperture 126, and one or more struts 112. In some embodiments, the hub 110 may have a shape generally similar to the shaft 182. For example, as shown in Figures 1A-D, the hub 1 0 can be generally circular/cylindrical, though the particular shape of the hub 100 is not limiting. In some embodiments, the hub 110 may be thin and thus cover only a small portion of the shaft 102, or may generally extend a portion of the length of the shaft 182, [0035] In some embodiments, the hub 110 may have 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 stmts 112 extending from its outer circumference, and the number of stmts is not limiting. The stmts 112 may be flexibly linked to the hub 110, thus allowing them to bend and wrap around the hub 111). In some embodiments, the struts 112 can be located circumferentially adjacent to one another. In some embodiments, struts 112 may not be located circumferentially adjacent, and can thus be located spaced apart along the length of the hub 110. In some embodiments, the struis 112 can have a thickness greater than the hub 11(5. In some embodiments, the stmts 112 can have a thickness less than the hub 11(5. In some embodiments, the siruts 112 can have a thickness the same as the hub 110. [00361 The plurality of struts 112 can be of different lengths and sizes, and their particular dimensions are not limiting. For example, struts 112 may have generally the same size in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the struts 112 may have generally different sizes. Once deployed, the struts 112 can expand to contact ihe lumen wall without substantially displacing any portion of ihe lumen wall, and thus without irritating or damaging the airways. [0037] As mentioned, in some embodiments, the stmts 112 can be configured to expand outward from the hub 1 0 towards the inner surface of the lumen of an airway. In some embodiments, the stmts 112 can expand radially outward from the hub 110. In some embodiments, the stmts 112 can expand radially outward from the hub H i) in a rotational fashion. In some embodiments, the struts 112 can expand radially outward from the hub 110 in a linear fashion. [00381 Ιβ some embodiments, the plurality of struts 112 can be generally spiral-shaped arms. The spiral-shaped arms can form a helix form, or can generally form the shape of a helix. The helix form of the plurality of struts 1 2 can be used to facilitate a seamless retraction of the spiral arms into a sheath if a sheath is being used. For example, the helix form can facilitate radial compressive force on the spiral arms as the arms are pulled into the sheath and/or as the sheath is extended over the arms. Thus, significant effort does not have to be used and there is less likelihood of breakage of the plurality of stmts 112. The helix form can also allow easier manufacturing of the measuring device. [0039] Additionally, each of the stmts 112 can further include at least one small protrusion 120, such as those shown in Figures 1A-C. In some embodiments, the siruts 112 can have a plurality of small protrusions 120. In some embodiments, the siruts 112 can all have the same amount of protrusions 120. In some embodiments, the struts 112 can all have different amounts of protrusions 120. In some embodiments, the small protrusions 120 can be whiskers, or thin filament whiskers, attached to a surface of the struts 112 facing an endoluminal wall. In some embodiments, the small protrusions 120 are formed by cutting and folding away portions of the struts 112. In some embodiments, the whiskers can extend away from the surface of the strut 112 facing an endo luminal wall. In some embodiments, each protrusion 120 can have the same length. In some embodiments, protrusion 128 can have a different length. [0040] In some embodiments, the protrusions 120 can be fonned from the same material as the strut 112. For example, the protrusions 120 can be a single ribbon, strip, slice, or portion of the material of the strut 112, which would give the protrusions 120 flexibility, and may reduce any need to additionally connect the protrusions 12(5 to the struts 112. The protrusion 120 may be pulled back from the strut 112 to any desired position for measurement of a lumen. [0041] In some embodiments, the thickness of the small protrusions 120 can be smaller in comparison to the thickness of the spiral arms as shown in Figure D. For example, the thickness of the struts 112 can be about 0.015 inches to about 0.020 inches, while the thickness of the small protrusions 120 can be about 0.002 inches to about 0.003 inches, though the particular dimensions are not limiting. The smaller thickness of the small protrusions 120 can allow the protrusions 120 to be more flexible than the struts 112. However, in some embodiments the struts 112 and small protrusions 120 can have generally the same thickness, as shown in Figures 1A-C. [0042] In some embodiments, when the strats 12 are inside the sheath, the small protrusions 120 can fold down substantially flush with the strats 112. Once the strats 112 are outside the sheath, the stnjts 112 can be extended radially outward from lumen axis, and the small protrusions 120 can unfurl to contact the lumen wall without damaging or irritating the lumen wall. The extension of the struts 112 and small protrusions 120 can occur automatically when the sheath is removed and does not require further input from the user, [0Θ43] When located in a large lumen, only the small protrusions 120 far out on the ends of the struts 112 will fold down due to contact with the lumen wall. However, as the lumen diameter decreases, more small protrusions 128 can fold down, indicating to a user that the lumen is smaller. In some embodiments, the small protrusions 120 fold down flush with the struts 112 to indicate the lumen size. In some embodiments, the small protrusions 120 are shaped so that as they fold down, they protrude into the inner radius of the strats 112 to indicate when the strut 112 is against the wall. In some embodiments, additional markings can be used to indicate the dimensions of the lumen. For example, one or more of the small protrusions 120 or struts 112 can have a color generally corresponding to a radius or diameter of the lumen at the point of contact with the colored portion. In some embodiments, certain protrusions 120 have a first color and certain other protrusions 128 have another color to indicate varying radial positions between the respective protrusions. In some embodiments, the outward radial force imposed by the small protrusions 120 and'Or struts 112 is such that the lumen wail is not substantially expanded/displaced radially outward. Advantageously, this can inhibit or prevent damage or irritation of the airways upon use of the emobidments of a sizing device 188. [0844] In some embodiments, the ends of small protrusions 120 can point in the same direction as the stmts 112, such as in a counterclockwise direction as shown in Figures 1A-C, In some embodiments, the ends of small protrusions 128 can point in ihe opposite direction as the struts 112, such as in a clockwise direction, [0045] In some embodiments, the small protrusions 120, or in fact any part of the device 100, can be made from nitinol, though other biocompatible metals and/or polymers can be used as well. The material forming the small protrusions 120 is not limiting. In some embodiments, the small protrusions 128 can be laser cut though the method of forming is not limiting. [0846] Upon insertion of the sizing device 188, a user may use medical imaging devices, such as a camera of an endoscope, to view the number, the location, and the form of expanded small protmsioris 128 having different sizes. The number, the location, and the form of expanded small protrusions 120 having different sizes can indicate the sizing of the lumen. For example, a user could tell which of the small protrusions 120 was expanded, which would let a user know the particular size of the lumen. A user may know this based on markings on the device 100, or may have prior knowledge of the sizing. Further, the device 180 ma be removed and a user could determine the particular size of the lumen by re viewing the device 1 8 after removal. Blocking Mechanism Sizing Device [0047] Figures 2A-B show an embodiment of a sizing device 208 that can include size determining portion 202 and a blocking mechanism 204. [0048] In some embodiments, the size determining/estimating portion 202 can be a plurality of wires 210, such as a plurality of generally longtidudinally extending wires as shown in Figure 2A, The wires 210 can extend generally in the same direction as the axis of a lumen to be measured 212, In some embodiments, the wires 210 can be generally straight upon insertion into the lumen 212. In some embodiments, the wires 210 can have a bend, such as shown in Figure 2 A, which can allow for the wires 218 to further bend in a predetermined direction. In some embodiments, the wires 210 may be shapeset with a slight bump-outward. The slight bump-outward shape of the wires can be used to appropriately expand the wires away from the axis when pushed. [0049] In some embodiments, the size determining portion 282 can have two, three, four, five or more wires 210, and the number of wires 210 is not limiting. In some embodiments, the wires 210 can be made of metal (e.g., nitinol) or polymer, though the type of material is not limiting. [0050] In some embodiments, the wires 218 can be formed as round wires, though the shape of the wires is not limiting. In some embodiments, the wires 210 can be cut from a plastic or a metal tube. In some embodiments, the entire device 280 can be formed from laser cut nitinol tubing. In some embodiments, the wires 218 can form a helix. In some embodiments, the wires 210 can form counter-wound helixes. In some embodiments, the wires 210 can form a braid. In some embodiments, the wires 210 can be covered with a flexible membrane. The flexible membrane can be biocompatible, and can prevent any problems using non-biocompatible wires 218. In some embodiments, the flexible membrane may be an elastic material, though the type of material is not limiting. [00511 The wires 210 can be connected to a blocking mechanism 204. The distal ends of the wires 210 may connect to the blocking mechanism 284 at a substantially- perpendicular angle, as shown in Figures 2A-B. However, the general angle of connection is not limiting, and other angles can be used. In some embodiments, the blocking mechanism 204 can be secured to the wall of the deployment catheter 206, thus preventing motion of the blocking mechanism 284 relative to the catheter. Accordingly, when a user pushes the wires 210 against the blocking mechanism 204 secured to the wall of the deployment catheter 286, the wires 218 can expand outward and away from each other while the catheter 206 and blocking mechanism 204 remain in the same position. [0052] Figure 2B illustrates the blocking mechanism 204 and wires 210 being located within the catheter 206, which can further be located within the lumen 212 of an airway. As shown, the catheter 206 and device 200 can have a generally circular cross- section, though the particular cross section is not limiting. Further, as shown the wires 210 can extend away from the center of the lumen 212 and towards the inner surface of the lumen 212, [0053] The size determining portion 202 can be deployed inside the lumen 212 for measurement of the lumen 212. In some embodiments, a shaft (not shown) can be used to adjust the position of the sizing device 28(5, and thus the size determining portion 282, within an airway lumen. For example, a shaft similar to the ones described above can be used to move the size determining portion 202. In some embodiments, the shaft can be attached to the sizing device 208, In some embodiments, the shaft can be integrally formed with ihe sizing device 280. [0054] In some embodiments, the wires 210 can be secured to the wall of the deployment catheter and limit the longitudinal movement of the sizing device 280, without the blocking mechanism 204. The distance the wire 210 can be pushed before contact with the lumen 212 can correlate to the lumen size and provide a user with the size of the lumen ihai the sizing device 208 is deployed in. A user may detect the lumen size by reading the distance the wires 218 are pushed (e.g., via a linear measurement at a proximal end of the wires) until the w ires touch the lumen wall. [0855] In some embodiments, the size determing portion 202 and blocking mechanism 284 can be inserted into a deployment cathether and/or sheath 206 for deployment of in the lumen 212 of an airway. Accordingly, the catheter 206 can be positioned to allow for the sizing device 200 to determine the size of a particular portion of an airway lumen. In some embodiments, the wires 218 can exit from ihe side of ihe deployment catheter 286 through, for example, cutouts, as shown in Figure 2A. [0056] In some embodiments, a similar configuration to that shown in Figures 2A-B can be used, except the wires 210 can expand radially outward when the blocking mechanism 204 is pulled proximaliy instead of the wires 218 being pushed distally. Accordingly, the motion is generally opposite of what is discussed above, though the structure is generally similar. [0057] In some embodiments, the proximal portions of the wire 218 can be secured to inhibit or prevent any longitudinal movement relative to the lumen wall 212. Similar to the above configuration, the distance the wire 210 can be compressed (or the amount the blocking mechanism 284 can be pulled) can be related to the lumen size. A user may detect the lumen size by reading the distance the wires 210 are compressed until the wires 21 touch ihe lumen wall 212. Caliper-Type Sizing Device [0058] Figures 3A-B show another embodiment of a sizing device for deteminmg or estimating the size of airway lumens. As shown, an endoluminal sizing device 400 can be made up of a measuring disc 402, a centering portion 404, and a size determining portion 406. Simiiar to the devices listed above, the size determining portion 406 can deploy (e.g., expand) inside the lumen of an airway 412, for example upon release from a sheath. In some embodiments, the sizing device 400 can be located on the end of a shaft or catheter 401, as shown in Figure 3A. This can allow a user to move the sizing device 400 to a particular location in an airway in order to measure it. Other methods of insertion can be used, and the method of insertion and translation of the sizing device 400 is not limiting. [00S9] Attached to the end of ihe shaft 401 can be the measuring disc 402 which can be used to measure the expansion of the size determining portion 406, though in some embodiments the measuring disc 402 can at least partially encircle the shaft 401. The measuring disc 402 can be generally circular in shape as shown in Figure 3B, though the the particular shape is not limiting. In some embodiments, the measuring disc 402 can be generally transparent or translucent to allow for a user to see through the measuring disc 402 to the size determining portion 486 beyond. In some embodiments, the measuring disc 402 is opaque. In some embodiments, the measuring disc 402 can be centered onto the shaft 401. In some embodiments, the measuring disc 402 can be integrally formed onto the shaft 401. In some embodiments, the measuring disc 402 can be attached to the shaft 401 through different means, such as mechanical, chemical, and adhesive. [0060] In some embodiments, as shown in Figure 3B the measuring disc 402 can have different marking 410 to reflect sizes. The markings 410 can be seen by a user in order to determine the size of an airway lumen. For example, the measuring disc 402 can have different rings showing different sizes, as shown as the circular markings 410 in Figure 3B. Different types of markings 410 can be used as well, and the type of markings 410 is not limiting. Further, different combinations of markings 410 can be used, or a single type of marking 410 can be used, [0061] A centering portion 404 can be connected to the measuring disc 402 opposite the shaft 401. In some embodiments, the centering portion 404 can be a wire or a tube, in some embodiments, the centering portion 404 can be generally rigid, in some embodiments, the centering portion 464 can be generally flexible. The centering portion 484 can be used to connect and align the measuring disc 482 and the size determing portion 486 along the axis of the lumen 412. [0862] In some embodiments, the size determining portion 406 can be composed of one or more struts 408 that can contract or expand according to the sizing of the lumen wall 412, The struts 408 can be, for example, wires, though the particular makeup of the struts 408 is not limiting. In some embodiments, the siruts 488 can form an expandable basket or a balloon shaped portion, [0863] In some embodiments, the struts 488 can be a combination of two or more of the aforementioned shapes, such as a plurality of wires and a balloon/basket shape, and the particular combination is not limiting. In some embodiments, the struts 488 can be formed from nitinol, though the material is not limiting. [0864] As mentioned, the centering portion 404 can be flexible, and can thus allow some motion of the centring portion 404 and the connected struts 488. If the centering portion 484 is flexible enough, it will allow the struts 408 to center the size determining portion 486 within a lumen 412, The flexible centering portion 484 thus allows for the siruts 408 to all compress in relatively the same manner, thereby centering the size determining portion 406, and none of the struts 408 may be under or overcompressed as compared to the other struts 488. [0865] In some embodiments, the size determining portion 406 can contract when placed inside the lumen. The degree of contraction can be scaled based on the measuring disc marking 418, Once the size determining portion 486 is placed inside the lumen wall, a user can view from the endoscope the size of the lumen by reading the location of the struts 488 with respect to the measuring disc marking 410. [0866] In some embodiments, the siruts 408 have generally free ends 489, such as the proximal ends, that extend within channels, or tracts, 411 in the measuring disc 402 and can move freely. Therefore, as the struts 488 expand outwards to contact the lumen 412, the free ends 489 can move within the channels 411 of the measuring disc 482. Thus, a user can view the measuring disc 481 and visualize where the free ends 489 are located, and can calculate the dimensions of the lumen 412. The measuring disc 482 can also contain a plurality of markings 410 that can be viewed by a user, and the user can compare the markings 418 to the free ends 489 to determine the size of the lumen 412. In some embodiments, the free ends 409 can be marked or can fluoresce in order to be easier for a user to visualize. [0067] In some embodiments, the proximal end of the size determining portion 406 can connect to the measuring disc 402 without a separate connecting mechanism. In some embodiments, the measuring disc 402 and the size determining portion 406 are connected by a connecting mechanism, such as the centering portion 404 shown in Figure 3A, In some embodiments, the connecting mechanism may include a centering mechanism to center the connecting mechanism substantially near the axis of the lumen. Circumscribing-Type Sizing Device [0068] Figure 4 illustrates another embodiment of a sizing device 500. In some embodiments, the device 580 can have a shaft 502 that extends in a lumen 514. The shaft 502 can be, for example, wires, metals, or polymers, and the type of material is not limiting. The shaft 502 can curve radially outwards, as shown in Figure 4. Thus, a generally spiral shape can be formed in the lumen 514 and can generally wrap around (circumscribe) the lumen. [0069] The device 500 can include a plurality of different portions 504/506/508 which can be visually different to indicate different sizing to a user. For example, the different portions 584/506/508 can be different colors, markings, or protrusions for ease of viewing. The portions 504/506/508 can be separated by different protrusions 511. At the end, the device 500 can have a measuring portion 510 having a free end 512. [0070] Thus, when in use, the portions 504/506/508 can extend and contact in the lumen 514, depending on the size of the lumen 514. From viewing the free end 512, a user can determine the size of the lumen. For example, a smaller lumen would contract the radius of portions 504/506/508, and thus the free end 512 would be located at a different position on the portions 504/506/588 than if the lumen was larger. The position of the free end 512 can be viewed by a user to determine the size of the lumen 514. Accordingly, the amount of overlap can indicate (by markings) the circumference of the lumen 514 in the plane of contact. [0071] In some embodiments, the free end 512 may be attached to the portions 504/506/508 in order to slide along the portions 504/506/588. In some embodiments, the free end 512 is proximal to the portions 504/506/508. In some embodiments, the free end 512 is distal to the portions 504/506/508.
