Step 5: Preparation of 4-chloro-6-fluoro-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
50 mg (0.166 mmol) of 6-fluoro-4-hydroxy-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one prepared in step 4 was dissolved in 2 mL of anhydrous toluene, to which 131 mg (0.498 mmol) of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and 50 μL (0.498 mmol) of trichloroacetonitrile (CCl3CN) were added, followed by stirring at 120° C. for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature. Ethyl acetate and water were added thereto, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 5/1-hexane/ethyl acetate, 3/1) to give 4 mg of the target compound 4-chloro-6-fluoro-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one as a pale yellow solid (0.013 mmol, yield: 8%).
