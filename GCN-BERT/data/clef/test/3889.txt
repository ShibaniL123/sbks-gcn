This application claims the benefit of the U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/810,128 filed Apr. 9, 2013 by the present inventor. This provisional patent application is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE There exists many versions of miniature golf games. Some commercial golf games are played outdoors with multiple greens and large putting surfaces; others use a board placed on tabletops. Still others use apparatus that is portable with many components that may be placed indoors or outdoors. However there is a need for a miniature golf game with a small number of inexpensive components that give an unlimited variety of layouts and shot difficulties to play with. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE A first embodiment of the invention presented herein describe a miniature golf game that has a portable putting green that may be placed on a horizontal flat surface such as a floor or rug in a house, or outdoors on level ground. The portable putting green has one or more depressions or cutouts simulating sand trap hazards and/or water hazards. Also imbedded in the putting green is a rotatable disk having hole simulating a golf cup, the center of the hole positioned away from the center of the rotatable disk. Also included in the first embodiment is a tee to be placed away from the green, a base holding the tee, obstructions located on the tee base, the obstructions serving to constrain the path of a shot toward the hole. Also included are two obstacles to place between the putting green and the tee base. Alternate embodiments are presented. The first embodiment miniature golf game is set up by placing the putting green on a flat level horizontal surface, placing the tee base a distance from the putting green, and placing the obstacles between the putting green and the tee. By positioning the putting green in various orientations relative to the tee base, orienting the tee base in various positions relative to the putting green, placing the obstacles in various positions between the putting green and the tee base, and finally rotating the rotatable disk relative to the putting position, a virtually infinite number of game layouts may be created for a player.

The terms right, left, rotated clockwise and counterclockwise apply to the figure the text refers to. The term layout refers to the positioning of the putting green on a horizontal surface, the rotational position of the disk relative to the putting green, and the positioning of the obstacles and the tee base relative to each other and to the putting green. FIG. 1 a shows a first embodiment of the present invention. The first embodiment consists of a putting green 101, a tee base 122, and two obstacles 110. FIG. 1b is a cross section of putting green 101. Putting green 101 is constructed using a putting green base 102 made of a rigid molded plastic. Putting green base 102 has a top surface 103, a beveled edge 112 on the periphery of the putting green base, two oval cavities 104 representing sand traps, a pinched oval cavity 106 representing a water hazard, a circular cavity 107, and a circular disk 108, matched to fit removably and tightly into a circular cavity 107. A circular hole 111 representing a cup is positioned on a circular disk 108 near an edge of circular disk 108. In the first embodiment, cavities are depressions in the molded plastic. In the first embodiment, tee base 122 consists of a tee platform 120 constructed out of molded plastic, a tee 118 constructed by making a small depression in the tee platform 120; and bumps 116, also constructed out of molded plastic, is attached to the tee platform 120. Tee base 122 has a cross section as illustrated in FIG. 1c. Also included in the first embodiment are two obstacles 110 made of routed plastic having the shape of a rock. The first embodiment is an attractive way to provide a golf game for children as well as adults and may be used indoors or outdoors. Referring to FIGS. 1a, 1b and 1c, putting green base 102, has approximate size of 23 inches by 26 inches, with trap hazards and water hazard cavities of size 4 inches by 6 inches. The regular circular disk 108 is made of foam that is colored green, and has diameter of 9.5 inches. The hole has diameter of 4.25 inches and has a center positioned 1.5 inches from the center of circular disk 108. The tee 118 has a width approximately a quarter of an inch, just small enough to hold a golf ball in position. In the first embodiment, putting green 101 and tee base 122 may be placed on an inside floor or on an approximately flat surface outdoors with obstacles 110 positioned between the putting green and the tee base. FIG. 2 a shows a second embodiment of the present invention. The second embodiment consists of a putting green 201 and a tee 218. The putting green is constructed from a putting green base 202. Putting green base 202 is constructed from a flat surface such as a rug remnant, or a piece of artificial turf. The putting green base 202 has base beveled edges 222 with two oval cavities 204 having oval beveled edges 220, a regular octagonal shaped cavity 209, an octagonal shaped disk 208 matched to fit removably and tightly into octagonal shaped cavity 209. A circular hole 211 is positioned in the octagonal disk near an edge of octagonal shaped disk 208. Tee 218 is constructed out of plastic, having a shape with cross section illustrated in FIG. 2c. FIG. 2c is shown in expanded scale relative to FIGS. 2a and 2b. In the second embodiment, the cavities are cutouts. The second embodiment is an inexpensive way to simulate a golf game for children as well as adults and may be used indoors or outdoors. Referring to FIGS. 2a, 2b and 2c, putting green base 202 may be constructed from a piece of artificial turf or a rug remnant. The dimensions of the various parts of the second embodiment are similar to those of the analogous parts of the first embodiment. Putting green 201 and tee 218 may be placed on an inside floor or on an approximately flat surface outdoors. Although not part of the second embodiment, obstacles 224 may be placed as shown in FIG. 2a; obstacles 224 may be any appropriately size item such as a small box, or a throw pillow. FIGS. 3 a through 3f illustrate various layouts and the affect the layouts have on shot placement and difficulty. These figures apply to the first embodiment, but with straightforward variations will apply to the second embodiment and alternate embodiments. FIG. 3 a illustrates a simple layout with no obstacles and a par-one straight path from the tee to the cup. FIG. 3 b is similar to FIG. 3a except that the putting green base 102 is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise so the path from the tee to the cup is slightly to the left. A path to the cup can be achieved with a single putt; however one of the oval cavities 104 is in play making it a difficult par-one shot. FIG. 3 c has a similar layout as FIG. 3a, except tee base 122 is placed a greater distance from the putting green 101 and two obstacles 110 have been added and positioned as shown in the figure. This layout creates a par-two rather than the par-one possibility of FIG. 3a. Note that the shot needs to avoid one of the bumps 116. FIG. 3 d has the putting green rotated 30 degrees clockwise from FIG. 3b, the rotatable disk is rotated so that the circular hole 111 is positioned to the left, the tee base 122 is positioned the same as FIG. 3b. and obstacles are added. This again is a par-two layout. FIG. 3 e and FIG. 3f show two layouts where the putting green, rotatable disk and obstacles are positioned similarly, but tee base 122 are rotated 30 degrees to the left and to the right respectively. In both cases they are two-par layouts, but different shot placements are required FIGS. 3 a through 3f described only a few of the virtually infinite robust number of layouts possible. Other layouts such as increasing distance between green and tee, adding additional obstacles, and making rules concerning out-of-bound penalties add challenge and variety. Alternate embodiments of the first and second embodiment are within the inventive concept presented herein. For example, the shape and dimensions of the putting green base may vary, the material that the putting green base and tee base are constructed of may be varied; the beveled edge or edges may have straight or curved bevels; the oval and pinched depressions may have different shapes, and different numbers of cavities and different locations on the putting green may be implemented. Inserts to the cavities and hole may be used, such as a tin cup inserted in the hole, and inserts in the hazard cavities simulating sand hazard or water hazards. A thin sheet of green felt, foam, or another material may be attached to the top surface 103 with the rotatable disk sized to be level with the top of the thin sheet. The thin sheet should provide the same travelling characteristics to a rolling golf ball as the circular disk. 1.
