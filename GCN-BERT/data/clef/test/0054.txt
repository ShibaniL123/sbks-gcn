SILICONE MODIFIED FATTY ACIDS, METHOD OF PREPARATION AND USAGE THEREOF CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. application No. 61/239,215 filed September 2, 2009, which is herein incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to silicone modified fatty carboxylic acid compounds. More specifically, the present invention relates to low molecular weight, i.e., short chain, silicone modified fatty carboxylic acids, their use and method of making same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There is a growing trend for natural based products in the personal care, pharmaceutical and retail industry. Use of vegetable oils and waxes is well known in the art; however, they generally have non-pleasant sensorial properties for personal care products. As a result, formulators typically employ low concentrations of these materials in their formulations. Formulators also frequently include ingredients to enhance the sensorial performance of skin care and hair care products. Silicones are one class of materials that are well known in the art for enhancing the sensory properties of personal care products. Typically, a formulator might separately add a vegetable oil or wax and a silicone to a personal care product in order to achieve a desired sensory profile. A number of silicone-modified fatty carboxylic acids are known in the art. Preparation of these prior art compounds included several processes, for example, a condensation reaction between siloxane containing hydroxyl groups and the carboxylic group of fatty acids. Another commonly used method includes hydrosilylation of olefinic esters in the presence of a metal catalyst. Another prior art process employed amino addition of an amino modified siloxane to the carboxylic group of a fatty carboxylic acid. Examples of these compounds and reactions are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,051,489 to O’Lenick, Jr., which discloses waxy lubricious solids prepared from silanol waxes for use in hair, skin and textile compositions. The compounds of this patent are prepared by reacting a silanol compound with a fatty carboxylic and or polycarboxylic acid, ester or anhydride. Another U.S. Patent No. 5,136,063 to O'Lenick, Jr. presents a series of silicone fatty esters suitable for applications in the treatment of textile and fibers. These compounds are prepared by way of a condensation reaction between the hydroxyl containing siloxane polymer and fatty carboxylic acid, ester or anhydride. U.S. Patent No. 5,1 1 5,049 discloses fatty carboxylic acid salts of organofunctional silicone amines. The synthesis of these compounds is performed via amino addition, where a silicone amine is neutralized by a fatty carboxylic acid. EP 0955340 discloses liquid silicone esters or blends prepared by means of hydrosilylation for use in personal care and textile softening compositions. U.S. Patent No. 4,912,242 discloses a process for the preparation of silicon esters through the hydrosilylation of allyl esters using a metal complex catalyst. U.S. Patent No. 4,725,658 to Thayer et al., discloses silicone esters prepared by hydrosilylation of fatty esters instead of fatty acids. Another disclosure of silicone-modified fatty acids includes U.S. Patent No. 3,563,941, which presents a silicone-carnauba copolymer synthesized by epoxy addition of an epoxy containing siloxane to the free hydroxyl groups present in the carnauba wax. The process of this patent utilizes carnauba wax containing unreacted hydroxyl radicals. The hydroxyl radicals react with epoxy groups of the silicon-containing compounds to form silicone-carnauba wax copolymer. In the present invention, however, it has been found that there are multiple benefits that can be obtained by first reacting a silicone with a fatty carboxylic acid and then incorporating this material into a personal, hair & skin (i.e., cosmetic composition), automotive, hard-surface, or textile enhancing composition. An object of the present invention is therefore to provide silicone-modified fatty carboxylic acids, i.e., silicone fatty esters, capable of imparting improved sensorial feeling on, for example, the skin or hair. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a modified silicone compound comprising the reaction product of: a) at least one cyclic ether silicone having the formula: MaMAbDcDBdTeTCfQg wherein; M=R1R2R3Si01/2 MA=R4R5R6SiOi/2 D=R7R8Si02/2 DB=R9R10SiO2/2 T=R11Si03/2 Tc=R12Si03/2; R1, R2, R3, R5, R6, R7, R8, R10, and R11 are each independently a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R4, R9, and R12 are each independently a monovalent hydrocarbon radical containing from 3 to 25 carbon atoms and possessing at least one epoxy or oxetane group; wherein subscripts a, b, c, d, e, f, and g are zero or positive and their sum is not greater than 25, with the proviso that at least one of subscripts b, d, and f is positive; and, b) at least one substantially pure fatty carboxylic acid. The present invention further provides a method for producing a modified silicone compound comprising: i) reacting at least one cyclic ether silicone having the formula: MaMAbDcDBdTeTCfQg wherein; M=R1R2R3Si0i/2 MA=R4R5R6SiOi/2 D=R7R8Si02/2 DB=R9R10SiO2/2 T=R11Si03/2 Tc=R12Si03/2; Q=Si04/2; R1, R2, R3, R5, R6, R7, R8, R10, and R11 are each independently a monovalent hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R4, R9, and R12 are each independently a monovalent hydrocarbon radical containing from 3 to 25 carbon atoms and possessing at least one epoxy or oxetane group; wherein subscripts a, b, c, d, e, f, and g are zero or positive and their sum is not greater than 25, with the proviso that at least one of subscripts b, d, and f is positive; with at least one substantially pure fatty carboxylic acid, in the presence of at least one catalyst. The novel fatty carboxylic acid-modified silicones of the present invention can, for example, improve the sensorial feeling on skin or hair, lower the viscosity and lower the color and the odor relative to the raw fatty acid. These siliconemodified fatty acids, i.e., silicone fatty esters, can be incorporated into cosmetic formulations in the form of emulsions, as blends with vegetable oils, and/or in a pure state.

And further according to yet another embodiment the present invention provides a personal care product comprising the modified silicone compound of the invention excluding a silicone compound prepared from sapucainha oil and at least one personal care product ingredient. Another embodiment of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a modified silicone compound derived from at least one cyclic silicone and a carboxylic acid of sapucainha oil and at least one pharmaceutical acceptable carrier. These cyclic ether silicone compounds can be prepared by hydrosilylation of an epoxy functional olefin with a hydride functional silicone. Examples may be found, for example, in U S. Patent Nos. 4,083,856, 6,365,696, and 5,258,480, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference. The following examples include, but are not limited to cyclic ether silicone compounds useful in the present invention: According to a specific embodiment, particular cyclic ether silicone compounds useful in the preparation of the modified silicone compound of the present invention include the following: I. I I. — SiO— SiO— Si— 1 S 1 Q, 1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyl-3-[2-(7-oxa-bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-yl)-ethyl]-trisiloxane; 1,1,3,3,5,5,5-heptamethyl-1-[2-(7-oxa-bicyclo[4.1,0]hept-3-yl)-ethyl]-trisiloxane; 1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyl-3-[2-(1-methyl-7-oxa-bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-yl)-propyl]- trisiloxane; 1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyl-3-oxiranyimethoxy-propyl-trisiloxane. 1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyl-3-(Ethyl-3-propoxymethyl-oxetanyl)-trisiloxane According to one embodiment of the invention, the number average molecular weight of the epoxy functional silicone used herein ranges from 150 g/mol to 2500 g/mol. According to another embodiment of the invention, the number average molecular weight of the epoxy functional silicone used herein ranges from 1 00 to 1 50 g/mol. According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the number average molecular weight of the epoxy functional silicone used herein ranges from 150 g/mol to 300 g/mol. The cyclic ether silicone compounds and fatty carboxylic acids of the invention react by the ring opening addition reaction of the carboxyl group on the fatty acid with the epoxy or oxirane group of the cyclic ether silicone compound. Since the fatty carboxylic acids contain free acid groups, i.e., -COOH, the silicone modified fatty acid copolymers contain ester linkages The amount of cyclic ether silicone compound used in the reaction is from about the stoichiometric equivalent, where there is not more than 1 epoxy group per 1 carboxylic acid group, or about a 1:1 to 1:10 cyclic ether silicone/fatty acid stoichiometric ratio. The fatty acids relevant to the practice of this invention include any fatty acid, i.e., fatty carboxylic acid, which is an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid, derived from, or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, the fatty carboxylic acids of the invention are considered to be substantially pure fatty carboxylic acids. By “substantially pure” it is meant that the fatty carboxylic acids used herein do not contain more than 5 percent nonfatty carboxylic acid components. Exemplary non-fatty carboxylic acid components include, for example, triglycerides, ionic salts, non-functional hydrocarbons, solvents and the like, which are not fatty acids as described herein. Natural fatty carboxylic acids commonly have a chain of 2 to 34 carbons (usually unbranched and even numbered), which may be saturated or unsaturated. However, larger fatty carboxylic acids are not common in nature or as synthetic materials. According to an embodiment of the invention the fatty carboxylic acid used to prepare the modified silicone compounds of the invention, are hydrocarbon radicals containing at least one carboxylic acid group and having from 4 to 28 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon radical may be saturated or unsaturated. However, the use of synthetic fatty acids having at least one carboxylic acid is contemplated herein. Another embodiment of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a modified silicone compound derived from at least one cyclic silicone and a carboxylic acid of sapucainha oil according to the method of the present invention and at least one pharmaceutical acceptable carrier. Illustrative examples of fatty carboxylic acids are oleic, linoleic, linolenic, palmitic, palmitoleic, myristic, stearic, chaulmoogric, hydnocarpic, gorlic, gollic, ricinoleic, behenic, malvalic acid, sterculic acid, 2-hydroxy-sterculic acid and caprylic acid, and combinations thereof. According to another embodiment of the invention, other fatty carboxylic acids are fatty carboxylic acids containing about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms and at least one carbon-carbon double bond. In still another embodiment, useful fatty carboxylic acids include, but are not limited to, the following: eleostearic acid, tall oil fatty acids, linseed oil fatty acids, tung oil fatty acids, safflower oil fatty acids, soybean oil fatty acids, and combinations thereof. Blends of fatty carboxylic acids can be used to prepare the modified silicone compounds of the invention. Examples of such blends include, but are not limited to, saponified olive oil, which typically contains the ingredients listed in Table A, below. Upon saponification of the oil the fatty carboxylic acid composition is similar in weight percent as the corresponding triglyceride in the parent compound. Free Acids 0.3% Oleic Acid Triglyceride 78-83% Polyunsaturated Linoleic Acid 6-9% Triglyceride Saturated Palmitic Acid 8-15% Triglyceride Stearic acid Triglyceride 1.5-3% As known in the art, natural fatty carboxylic acids can be prepared by saponifying a triglyceride and removing the glycerin as a by product. Whereas, synthetic fatty acids are typically prepared by oxidizing alpha olefins. Suitable catalysts for preparing the novel silicone modified fatty acids of the present invention include, for example, tertiary amines, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, alkali hydroxides and Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride, tin tetrachloride, aluminum trichloride and tetraisopropyl titanate. According to one embodiment of the invention, tetraisopropyl titanate is the catalyst used to prepare the silicone modified fatty carboxylic acids. The amount of catalyst that should be used is within the range from about 0.001 to 0.1 weight percent and preferably from about 0.001 to 0.01 weight percent of the total reactant components. The reaction can also be carried out in suitable organic solvent in order to use lower reaction temperatures. Suitable organic solvents include any neutral solvent free of active hydrogens such as esters, ethers, ketones, hydrocarbons, tertiary amines and amides. Examples of suitable organic solvents are pentane, isooctane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, isohexane, n-heptane, n-octane, nhexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, isobutylbenzene, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, petroleum naphtha and the like, alone or in admixture. Isopropanol is typically preferred for utilization as the organic solvent. The compounds of the present invention are best prepared by mixing a fatty carboxylic acid with an epoxy containing siloxane in the presence of a suitable catalyst. If desired the solution can be heated, usually to about 80-90°C, to reduce the reaction time. The modified silicone compound compositions obtainable through the method of this invention can vary from liquid to wax in physical appearance, with light to yellow color. These silicone esters are easily incorporated in cosmetic products and the achieved benefits in the formulations are spreading, lubricity and a nice sensorial feeling on the skin and/or hair. The modified silicone compound compositions of the present invention have particular value in the personal care products. Because of the unique characteristics of smoothness and sensorial feel, these compositions can be used alone, or blended with other personal care product ingredients, to form a variety of personal care products. Examples of personal care product ingredients include, but are not limited to, ester waxes, oils and fats of animal or vegetable origin, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, alkyl esters of fatty acids; hydrocarbon oils and waxes; water, organic solvents, perfumes, surfactants, oil-soluble vitamins, water-soluble vitamins, oilsoluble drugs, water-soluble drugs, actives, pharmaceutical compounds and the like. In particular, the modified silicone compound compositions of the invention are lubricious and will improve the properties of skin creams, skin care lotions, moisturizers, facial treatments such as ache or wrinkle removers, personal and facial cleansers, bath oils, perfumes, colognes, sachets, sunscreens, pre-shave and after-shave lotions, liquid soaps, shaving soaps, shaving lathers, and the like. They can be used in hair shampoos, hair conditioners, hair oils, hair waxes, hair sprays, mousses, permanents, depilatories, and cuticle coats, and the like to enhance gloss and drying time, and provide conditioning benefits. In addition, the modified silicone compounds of the present invention exhibit a variety of advantageous and beneficial properties such as clarity, shelf stability, and ease of preparation. Hence, they have wide application, but especially in skin care, sunscreens, antiperspirants, deodorants, in perfumes as a carrier, and for hair conditioners. Though this invention has already been described with substantial specificity, reference is made to the following examples to characterize more specific applications of this invention.

Displayed in the Tables 4 and 5 below are the Examples, Comparative examples and Formulations. Each Formulation was tested for tack by an eight-member panel. Each panel member placed an aliquot of each Formulation on the underside of the arm. The material was rubbed into the skin and the panel member rated each formulation on a scale of 1 to 5. 1 being the least tacky and 5 being the most.

Each panel member placed an aliquot of each sample on the underside of the arm. The material was rub into the skin and the panel member rated each sample on a scale of 1 to 5. 1 being the least tacky, oily, glossy or spreadable and 5 being the most. The control was natural olive oil. Example 5 was tested for oiliness, gloss, tack and spreading ability by a five-member panel. The control was saponified palm oil. Each panel member placed an aliquot of Example 5 and saponified palm oil on the underside of the arm. The material was rub into the skin and the panel member rated each sample on a scale of 1 to 5. 1 being the least tacky, oily, glossy or spreadable and 5 being the most. Results Table 6 below shows the average ratings for the five-member sensory panel performed with Example 4 and its blends with olive oil. The amount of modified silicone in each formulation is expressed in weight percent. All formulations are liquid at room temperature. Table 7 below shows the average ratings for the five-member sensory panel performed with Example 5 and saponified palm oil.

A decreasing range of oiliness and gloss is observed along the formulations comprising higher amounts of silicone fatty ester. Spreading ability and tack of the natural olive oil is very close to what is observed for blends comprising silicone fatty ester plus olive oil and the Example 4 tested in pure concentration. Furthermore the sensory panel revealed that Example 4 has better absorption onto the skin than natural olive oil and provides a dry touch in the skin that isn’t observed with the natural oil. A lower odor is noticed too. Results presented in Table 7 reveals that Example 5 has lower tack, oiliness and similar spreading ability relative to the palm fatty acid. On the other hand it is glossier, which usually is a desired property for hair care applications. As observed for Example 4, the silicone fatty ester derived from palm oil has better absorption onto the skin than the natural oil and presents lower odor too. Finally, results from table 6 and 7 illustrate that the sensory feeling on the skin can be adjusted by the use of different concentrations or types of siliconemodified fatty acids. Personal Care Formulation A containing Example 1 was prepared with the ingredients presented in Table B, below: Table B: Personal Care Formulation A (Bath Oil) Parts White Mineral Oil Isopropyl Myristate Oleth-2 Personal Care Formulation A containing Example 1 was prepared as a representative bath oil formulation and was prepared in the usual and customary manner as know in the art. The addition of Example 1 to Personal Care Formulation A decreased the tack and increased the spread ability of the formulation.
