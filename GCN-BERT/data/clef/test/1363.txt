Step 5
To Compound 203 (90 mg, 0.162 mmol) in ethanol (1 mL) and THF (1 mL) solution was added 2 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (0.81 mL, 1.62 mmol), the mixture was stirred under reflux for 7 hours. 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by diol silica gel chromatography (chloroform - methanol) to obtain Compound I-304 (56.1 mg, 64% yield) as a brown solid.
