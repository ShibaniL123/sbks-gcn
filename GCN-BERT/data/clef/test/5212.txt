SURGICAL SUTURING DEVICE WITH TRANSVERSE ENGAGEMENT Related Case This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/852,050, filed March 15, 2013, the subject matter of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Background of the Invention The present invention relates to an apparatus capable of enabling a practitioner to thread a suture in subcutaneous tissue from a remote access point, to surgical methods facilitated by such an apparatus, and to associated tools useful with the apparatus for performing such surgical methods. Various surgical methods require the placement of a suture deep inside subcutaneous tissue for the purpose of supporting, severing, ligating, or constricting tissue, vessels, ligaments, nerves or other anatomy or for pulling another device into position defined by the suture pathway. Typically, this necessitates making an incision through the skin and subcutaneous tissue in order to gain sufficient access for deploying the suture directly to the desired location, for example, in an open surgical procedure or for feeding a suture passing instrument with an endoscopic or laparoscopic instrument to a distal location from the initial point of access. An example of one such procedure, in the field of plastic surgery, is the mid-face lift. As part of this procedure, an incision is made in an inconspicuous location to conceal the incision and to make scarring less obvious. The facial tissue is then separated to achieve sufficient access and mobility of the tissue to permit one or more sutures to be deployed to reattach and/or reposition the tissue into a more aesthetically desirable result. In addition, it is often desirable to anchor ends of the sutures to a rigid structure, for purposes of support. In practice, however, the selection of an anchoring structure which is suitable for fixation, which is accessible, and which can provide an inconspicuous incision, often complicates the procedure and results in a significant distance between the supported tissue and the fixation structure. The can result in a procedure which requires extensive surgery, which can be expensive, which can create significant trauma to the tissue, and which can take a significant amount of time to heal (e.g., a matter of weeks), and may also create sub-optimal aesthetic results. Various procedures have been attempted to reduce the resulting trauma to a patient, the corresponding expense of the procedure, and the time required for recovery. For example, one attempted procedure has been to use needles to implant a device having barbed profiles capable of engaging subcutaneous tissue at a location remote from the point of access. In practice, however, such barbs have been found to be prone to release after a relatively short period of time, often on the order of a few months. Release of the barbs then allows the engaged tissue to sag. Other attempted procedures have made use of endoscopes to reduce the size of the accessing incision. However, endoscope-guided suturing devices are bulky mechanisms, and tend to require considerable separation of the tissue layers and the severing of connective fibers in order to pass the instrument from the incision at the anchor location to the intended base of the suture supporting loop, and to surgically release the naturally occurring connective fibers so that the lift will be effective. Moreover, in the case of an endoscopic-guided mid-face lift, significant care and skill are required to avoid rupturing critical branches of the facial nerve as the device traverses a path from the temporal fascia to the intended location. Furthermore, endoscopic suturing devices are limited in the amount of tissue that can be engaged distally to distribute the lifting force, which can make the sutures prone to pull through the tissue (so-called "cheese-wire effect") over time. Additionally, the endoscopic mid-face lift begins in the temporal fascia in the hairline in order to hide the insertion incision scar and to provide a suitable structure to anchor the sutures. However, this alters the naturally occurring anchor location of the mid-face tissue to a location which is substantially superior and which can result in a lift vector which is long and constrained by other anatomy, which can affect the aesthetics of the lift. It has therefore remained desirable to provide a minimally invasive technique for redirecting a suture along a desired pathway or to transfer a suture from one internal pathway to another through the use of external manipulation and tactile feel, as well as to achieve an optimum suture deployment vector for a desired procedure, while providing a practitioner with considerable flexibility in the choice of vector and suture configurations and the ability to capture multiple sutures. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus and associated tools are provided for enabling a practitioner to thread a suture in subcutaneous tissue from a remote access point, to facilitate any of a variety of surgical methods. In addition to enabling advantageous placement of the suture, the device utilizes small gage needles to penetrate the skin. As a result, there is no incision, or a concern for scarring, which enables the location of an anchoring point to be selected to optimize the procedure to be performed. For convenience of description, the discussion which follows will primarily refer to use of the present invention to perform a mid-face lift. Nevertheless, it is to be understood that improvements in accordance with the present invention can be used to perform other procedures, including other mid-face lift procedures, and other lift procedures, as well as other surgical procedures which can benefit from the noninvasive percutaneous deployment and manipulation of a suture in a pathway. As an example, and for the illustrative case of a mid-face lift, this enables the suture to be placed through the skin and into the periosteum of the zygomatic arch, which then serves as the anchoring structure for the mid-face lift. In addition to providing a strong anchoring location for the lift, the zygomatic arch is a naturally occurring anatomical fixation point for the tissue that comprises the mid-face. Additionally, the present invention enables an improved aesthetic result to be achieved by allowing the development of a more aesthetic lift vector and a shorter lift length. This is to be distinguished from other procedures, such as the modified "S-Lift", which provides access to the mid-face from an incision around the ear, and the previously described endoscopic lift, which can both disrupt and sever the connective tissue which connects the mid-face to the zygomatic arch, and which can result in a more dramatic aesthetic change with significant repositioning of tissue which may be considered undesirable and less natural. In addition to aesthetic advantages, and by providing a naturally occurring aesthetic vector which is shorter, the present invention can achieve a vector which, for the example of a mid-face lift, can advantageously be contained within a safe region known as the golden triangle, and which avoids having to insert surgical instruments past sensitive anatomy such as the temporal branch of the facial nerve which, if severed, can result in paralysis of the face . Additionally, the present invention enables the suture to be threaded inside the tissue without disrupting the surrounding tissue, in an advantageous configuration that is controlled by the surgeon, and which minimizes trauma and enables the surgeon to avoid the need to sever naturally occurring ligature connecting the mid-face to the zygomatic arch, Further, and for the illustrative example of a mid-face lift, the present invention enables the surgeon to deploy a suture in a triangular loop support structure with the apex of the triangle at the anchor location and a relatively wide base, typically on the order of 1 cm, in the soft tissue to better distribute the lifting force. The advantages obtained using the improvements of the present invention for the noninvasive percutaneous deployment of a suture pathway in the illustrative example of the mid-face lift are also applicable to various other procedures. As another illustrative example, improvements in accordance with the present invention can be used to create a subcutaneous suture loop around a tendon or a ligament without necessitating an incision. In the case of carpal tunnel surgery, a tendon is typically severed in an open procedure dissecting down to the tendon and the tendon is then severed with a scalpel. Instead, a suture loop, for example, in a U-shaped configuration) can be deployed around the tendon using the improvements of the present invention. Guidance of the structures around critical anatomy, such as nerves, can be achieved with ultrasonic guidance. Then, the suture loop can be manipulated back and forth to cut through the tissue. A separate needle can be deployed, if desired, to limit passage of the suture loop through engaged tissue in cases where a complete severing of the tissue is not to take place. As a further alternative, the procedure can be performed with saline, for example, for hydro-dissection, or with the addition of an anesthetic. Similar techniques can be used for the suturing used to repair an Achilles Tendon, or for repairing Varicose veins, or to close off an organ or vessel by tying it shut. Improved instruments and methods for deploying and manipulating sutures in subcutaneous tissue are described in International Application No. PCT/US2008/009012, filed July 25, 2008, which describes an external guide for aligning a suture with subcutaneous eyelets, and an expandable aperture for engaging a strand which is hidden from view; and in U.S. Patent Application No. 12/384,326, filed April 2, 2009 (also International Application No. PCT/US2010/000891, filed March 25, 2010), which describe an external guide for aligning a suture with internal eyelets which can be tethered, as well as removable, the subject matter of each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. In practice, however, the geometry of these guide structures must be taken into account by a practitioner when deploying such devices. This has the potential for reducing the practitioner's flexibility, which can in turn require sub-optimal positioning of the suture loop in order to accommodate variations in a patient's anatomy, which can limit the locations in the body where such devices can be used. There is also the potential for bending forces to affect guided needle systems, which can cause deflection of the needle to increase exponentially with the length of the needle. This can in turn limit the ability of the guiding needle to couple with its target as the distances increase, unless the needle profiles are increased in size to increase stiffness and/or the needle lengths are kept short and/or the size of the targeted elements is increased. However, this can limit the minimum bore diameter of the needles. In addition, such structures also involve the coupling of elements, such as eyelets, to the guides, which can result in additional components and procedural steps for the practitioner. In accordance with the present invention, subcutaneous coupling with a distally deployed cannula, or other cooperating element, permits even the more complex suture pathway to be configured in the subcutaneous tissue into a desired a loop configuration or some other prescribed pathway without requiring an external alignment structure. Morever, bending forces on subcutaneous tools are better accommodated by allowing for re-directed adjustment of the components to achieve the desired coupling, which can be confirmed by tactile feel, electronic sensing, as well as ultrasonic or other guidance systems toward subcutaneous needles for subcutaneous mating with target elements. This significantly increases the percutaneous flexibility of the practitioner to manipulate suture pathway into optimally desired configurations, making the use of improvements in accordance with the present invention appropriate for a wider variety of procedures and anatomical targets.

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments Figure 1 shows an embodiment of an apparatus produced in accordance with the present invention which is presently considered as being preferred. The engagement tool 1 includes a body 2 with a penetrating member 3 which is affixed to the body. In the preferred embodiment, the penetrating member 3 is made from a cannula which allows a capture mechanism 4 to translate within the penetrating member 3. In other embodiments, the penetrating member 3 can be of other constructions, including solid materials, and the capture mechanism can be affixed to the penetrating member or coupled to the outside of the penetrating member. The penetrating member 3 is shown with a pointed tip at the distal end of the penetrating member 3, which is preferred to facilitate entry into tissue such as skin. The tip of the penetrating member can also be of other configurations, including blunt or rounded shapes, if appropriate for an application where the device can readily pass through tissue without having a sharp point, such as when there is a prior incision or puncture. An introducer needle can be used to facilitate the insertion of a penetrating member having a blunt or rounded tip, if desired. In the preferred embodiment of Figure 1, an actuator 5 interacts with a carriage 6, which is preferably coupled to the proximal end of the capture mechanism 4. In this preferred embodiment, when the actuator is depressed, the actuator 5 rotates about a pivot and the gears of the actuator interact with the linear gears of the carriage, causing the capture mechanism 4 to reciprocate within the penetrating member 3. Figure 6 shows the engagement tool 1 with the actuator 5 depressed and rotated forward, placing the carriage 6 and the attached capture mechanism 4 in a retracted position and compressing a return spring 7 for returning the capture mechanism to its original state when the actuator mechanism is released. Any of a variety of actuator mechanisms can be used as alternatives. For example, the penetrating member can translate and the capture mechanism can be fixed, or the actuator can be directly coupled to the penetrating member or the capture mechanism, where no carriage is used, and where there is no spring return. It is also possible to manually couple a capture mechanism to the penetrating member without an actuator. Referring again to the preferred embodiment in Figure 1, the engagement tool 1 also includes an indicator 8. In applications where the penetrating member 3 is inserted into tissue, the penetrating member is typically hidden from view. The indicator 8, as shown, remains above the tissue and provides a visual indication of the location of features of the penetrating member. For example, an engagement locator 9 can be used to locate suture engaging features of the penetrating member, and a tip locator 10 can be used to locate the tip of the penetrating member. The indicator 8 is preferably made from a flexible material, for example, nitinol wire, which is sufficiently stiff to provide the desired visual indication, but with the added feature that the indicator can be bent out of the way of occluded tissue which may occur as the user introduces the device into the skin or manipulates the device toward the target location. In the preferred embodiment, the locators 9 and 10 are applied adhesive materials. Other flexible and non-flexible materials can also be used, as well as well as other forms of visual locators, such as beads or sleeves. A plurality of engagement locators 9 can be used to identify multiple engagement locations, if desired. Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the engagement region 2 identified in Figure 1, showing the distal end 11 of the penetrating member 3. In the preferred embodiment, the penetrating member 3 includes an engagement feature 12 which is shown as an "L" shaped relief in the penetrating member. While Figure 2 shows only one engagement feature 12, it is possible to have more than one engagement feature, if desired. Figure 5 is an isometric view of the region 5 shown in Figure 1. In the preferred embodiment the capture mechanism 4, which is shown in its forward-most position, includes an angled front tip. In this location, the engagement feature 12 is closed, preventing it from receiving an object, such as a cannula or suture. While it is also possible to leave the engagement feature partially open so that it can receive a small diameter object, such as a suture or cannula, unless the engagement feature is smoothly contoured it will act as a catch point when penetrating or retracting through tissue, particularly when used to penetrate skin. By blocking the opening with the capture mechanism, tissue is prevented from getting caught on or in the engagement feature. A further advantage of the illustrated embodiment is that while the capture mechanism 4 is in the state shown in Figure 2, a transition remains along the penetrating member at the engagement feature which provides the user with a tactile indication that an object, such as a cannula or suture, which is held in a generally transverse orientation to the penetrating member in Figure 2, traverses across the top of the penetrating member and comes in contact with the engagement feature 12, as will later be shown Figure 15. To be noted is that the term "transverse" is not intended to mean that the described features must meet at a right angle to each other, and that other angles can also be established for this. Figure 7 shows the distal end of the engagement mechanism 11 with the capture mechanism 4 in a retracted position. Figure 8 is an enlarged isometric view of the distal end of the engagement mechanism 11 shown in Figure 7. In this retracted state, the engagement feature is open to receive a desired object. The penetrating member 3 is preferably made from a cannula with a pointed tip. Referring to Figure 3, the cannula is preferably flattened into an oval geometry in the region 13, The main advantage of an oval geometry is structural strength, so that for a given depth of relief required to capture a desired object, there will still be sufficient strength in the penetrating member. While it is also possible to use a larger cannula for the penetrating member, to retain the structural integrity, it is typically desirable to minimize the size of the penetrating member to reduce unnecessary trauma to the tissue. Figures 3 and 4 show preferred cross sections for the bracketed regions 13 and 15. Bracketed region 14 is a transition region from the oval region 13 to the circular region 15. Figure 9 shows a preferred embodiment of a tethered cannula tool 16. The tethered cannula tool 16 includes an alternative embodiment body 17 which holds an outer cannula 18 and narrow cannula 19 sized to interact with the engagement feature 12 of the engagement tool 1. The cannulas 18 and 19 are further coupled with a strand 20, which is preferably a suture but which can also be a flexible wire. The cannula 19 is preferably slidingly received within the cannula 18, and the strand 20 is preferably slidingly received within the cannula 19. Figure 9 also shows an indicator 21 having cannula locators 22 and 23 which serve to identify the region where the narrow cannula 19 is exposed. The indicator 21 is preferably made with a flexible material, such as nitinol wire, for the same reasons as were previously discussed for the indicator 8 of the engagement tool 1 described in Figure 1, and the locators 22 and 23 are preferably made with drops of adhesive, as previously described. Again, the indicator 21 may be made of a flexible or stiff material, and various markings or identifiers can be used to identify regions of the cannulas 18 and 19. If the strand 20 is held in tension, the engagement tool 1 can interact with the strand without needing any of the other elements shown in Figure 9. As an alternative, a single cannula (either 18 or 19) can be used with the strand 20 to interact with the engagement tool 1. However, in practice, a tethered cannula which includes each of the elements 18, 19 and 20 is particularly advantageous when used in combination with the preferred embodiment of the engagement tool in Figure 1 as will be described below. Figures 10 shows a tethered cannula associated with the tool 16, including the outer cannula 18, narrow cannula 19 and tether 20, in transverse alignment with the engagement tool 1. Figures 11 and 12 are enlarged views of the region 11 of Figure 10. Figures 10 to 12 show the outer cannula 18 positioned at the opening of the engagement feature 12 of the penetrating member 3. The diameter of, and material forming the outer cannula are selected to give the tethered cannula sufficient strength, stiffness and geometry to facilitate engagement with the engagement tool. In use, it is advantageous to be able to manipulate the protruding member 3 of the engagement tool and the tethered cannula of the tool 16 into alignment. For the case where the tethered cannula is deployed first, the engagement tool is inserted into the tissue toward the tethered cannula. As the tip of the penetrating member of the engagement tool approaches the tethered cannula, the tissue can be manipulated by adjusting the attitude of the tethered cannula and the penetrating member until the tip of the penetrating member contacts the tethered cannula. The force of this manipulation exerts a bending force on the tethered cannula and, if the cannula is too weak, it becomes difficult to position the tissue so that the tethered cannula can contact the tip of the penetrating member and then progress along the upper surface of the protruding member, in the orientation shown, until coming into contact with the engagement region 12. As an alternative, it is also possible for the end of the outer cannula 18 opposite the tether to be inserted into the tissue toward a previously deployed penetrating member of the engagement tool, if preferred for a given procedure. To facilitate this, the tip of the outer cannula 18 opposite the tether can be pointed. In the preferred embodiment, the geometry of the engagement region 12 provides the user with tactile feedback that the tethered cannula is positioned for engagement. The indicator 8 and engagement locator 9 of the engagement tool also provide the user with a visual indication as to where the engagement will occur, as would the indicator 21 of the tethered cannula tool 16 shown in Figure 9, if used. While it is advantageous to have tactile feel and visual indicators, it is also possible to have other forms of indicators or alignment such as electrical signals that sense the contact of the different segments of the tethered cannula with other segments of the penetrating member of the engagement tool. Thin insulators, such as polymide tubing, can be used to isolate different elements of the tethered cannula and the penetrating member of the engagement tool so that when, for example, the outer cannula 18 contacts the penetrating member 3, a signal is produced, and when the outer cannula 18 is in contact with the penetrating member 3 at the engagement feature, another signal is produced. Further signals can similarly be developed when the narrow cannula is in contact with the penetrating member or with the capture mechanism. Ultrasound or other sensing devices can also be used to detect features of the penetrating member 3, if desired for a particular application. Referring to Figure 12, the width of the upper opening of the engagement feature 12 is sufficiently large for the narrow cannula 19 to enter the engagement feature when the capture mechanism 4 is retracted. While the width of the opening could also be designed to accommodate the outer cannula 18, it is advantageous to minimize the width of the opening to maintain as much structural integrity of the penetrating member as possible, so that it can be kept small in size. Referring next to Figure 13 and the enlarged view of zone 14 shown in Figures 14 and 15, the engagement tool is shown with the actuator 5 depressed and the capture mechanism 4 retracted. In a preferred sequence, the outer cannula 18 is held in contact with the penetrating member 3 at the engagement feature 12. When the capture mechanism 4 is retracted, the tethered cannula 18 is withdrawn in the orientation shown until the narrow cannula 19 can enter the vertical slot in the engagement feature 12. Again, while a vertical slot could be made to have a sufficient size to accommodate the outer cannula 18, sizing the slot to only accommodate a narrow cannula 19 allows the strength and the size of the penetrating member to be improved, as previously discussed. At this point the actuator 5 is released, as shown in Figure 16, and the capture mechanism advances to capture the narrow cannula 19 as shown in the enlarged views of the region 17 shown in Figures 17 and 18. The angled tip of the capture mechanism 4 then captures the narrow cannula 19 in the engagement feature 12 so it cannot be vertically removed from the engagement feature. In the preferred embodiment, the horizontal slot of the "L" shaped engagement feature is too small to receive the narrow cannula 19. However, as the narrow cannula 19 is axially withdrawn, the strand 20 can enter the engagement feature and is driven by the capture mechanism along the small horizontal slot of the "L", into the forward position shown Figure 19. The stroke of the capture mechanism 4 is preferably limited so that a gap is left at the distal end of the horizontal slot of the "L" shaped engagement feature to allow several sutures to freely slide through this region without being impinged upon by the capture mechanism. Figure 20 shows a plan view showing two strands 20 at the distal end of the horizontal slot of the engagement feature, with the capture mechanism 4 in its extended position. It is also possible to have the capture mechanism extend further, to engage the strand, if desired. An additional advantage of this configuration is that subsequently tethered cannulas can be engaged and captured without risking of losing the first strand from the first tether. This is because the first tether is always blocked from escaping the engagement feature by either the capture mechanism, a second outer cannula or a second narrow cannula. Figure 21 shows an alternative embodiment of the engagement mechanism. In this arrangement, the penetrating member 4a includes an engagement feature 12a which is "V" shaped. The capture mechanism 4a is a hook-like device which, in the state shown and when retracted, can capture the tethered cannula positioned in transverse alignment with the engagement feature 12a. The "V" shaped engagement feature of the penetrating member is less likely to catch tissue as it passes through, so there is less need to block the engagement feature during penetration or withdrawal, as is contemplated with the preferred embodiment. As with the preferred embodiment, the penetrating member 3a is again preferably made from a cannula where the section 13a is flattened into an oval cross section in order to maximize the available geometry of the engagement feature 12a. Figure 22 shows the region 22 of Figure 21. Upper portion of the penetrating member are slotted to provide a relief for the hook of the capture mechanism 4a. This allows the dimensions of the hook to be optimized, within the confines of the penetrating member 3a. Figures 23 and 24 show the hook retracted, in a position for capturing a tethered cannula located in the engagement region prior to retraction. It is to be noted that, as an alternative, the hook of the capture mechanism 4a can be oriented to face in the opposite direction as is shown in Figures 23 and 24, if desired, to instead face toward the distal tip and begin on the proximal side of the engagement feature. In such as an arrangement, the capture mechanism would extend toward the distal tip to engage a tethered cannula in a similar fashion as was described for the preferred embodiment. In addition, the capture mechanism 4a could be designed with two hooks, one hook facing distally toward the tip and another hook facing proximally away from the tip, so the tethered cannulas could be captured by either retracting or extending the hooks. As with the preferred embodiment, it is preferred that section 13a of the penetrating member 3a is flattened into an oval in the area of the engagement zone, instead of being round. As in the preferred embodiment, flattening a cannula in this region allows the engagement region to be of a larger dimension. As a further alternative, the entire cannula can be flattened, as well. Figures 25 and 26 show an alternative embodiment illustrating a penetrating member 3b having two engagement features 12b. Such a configuration can be used to interact with a rotating capture mechanism, for example. To be noted is that while the two engagement features 12b are shown with the same overall configuration, it is also possible for the engagement features 12b to have different configurations, if useful for a particular application. Figures 27 to 30 show an alternative embodiment capture mechanisms 4b which is rotated by 90 degrees in each progressive figure, corresponding to the rotational capture mechanism 4b shown in Figure 31. Figure 32 shows the capture mechanism 4b inserted into the penetrating member 3b, with the capture mechanism oriented as shown in Figure 28. By progressively rotating the capture mechanism, in this case by 90 degrees, the two engagement features 12b can be selectively closed off from receiving a tethered cannula, or open to receive a cannula, and then closed off again to capture a tethered cannula or a strand in the forward section of either of the engagement features. In Figure 32, the forward-most engagement feature 12b, closest to the distal tip of 3b, is shown in the open configuration, ready to receive a tethered cannula within the forward notch of the engagement feature, which is available to receive a narrow cannula. In Figure 33, the capture mechanism 4b is rotated by 90 degrees, as shown in Figure 29. In this orientation, a narrow cannula or strand (not shown) are captured in the forward notch of the engagement feature if present in the notch before rotation. In this orientation, the rear-most engagement feature 12b, which is farther from the distal tip, is open to receive a second tethered cannula. In Figure 34, the capture mechanism 4b is rotated by another 90 degrees, as is shown in Figure 30. In this orientation, the forward notches of both of the engagement features 12b have openings where a narrow cannula or strand can be captured by the capture mechanism 4b. Figures 35 and 36 show an alternative embodiment capture mechanism 4c having a flexible latch. The latch is preferably made from a flexible wire, in the configuration shown. However, other constructions can also be developed, if appropriate for a particular application. The curvature of the latch in the vicinity of the engagement feature 12c provides a smooth transition on the outer surface of the penetrating member 3c, to prevent tissue from being snagged by the engagement feature. The guard 25c is shown in a forward position, which prevents the latch from opening by making it difficult to flex. Figures 37 and 38 show the capture mechanism 4c with the guard 25c retracted, which then allows the capture mechanism 4c to flex, for opening the engagement feature 12c. Figures 39 and 40 show the capture mechanism 4c bent down to open the engagement feature 12c for receiving a tethered cannula or a strand. If desired, the capture mechanism 4c can be configured with a preferential bend so that when the guard 25c is retracted the capture mechanism 4c bends inwardly as shown, or the flexible capture mechanism 4c can be configured to bend outwardly, to continue to block the engagement feature with the guard 25c until it is bent inwardly by a force applied to it from a tethered cannula or a strand. Figures 41 and 42 show a further alternative embodiment of a capture mechanism 4d and a guard 25d. In this embodiment, the guard 25d is fixed and preferably cooperates with the capture mechanism 4d when placed in alignment with the guard 25d. While the capture mechanism 4d is shown as a flexible wire, other constructions can also be implemented. Alignment of the capture mechanism 4d with the guard 25d can be achieved by reciprocating the capture mechanism 4d, by rotating the capture mechanism 4d or by configuring the capture mechanism 4d to bend out of the way responsive to a force applied to the capture mechanism 4d. For example, Figures 43 and 44 show the capture mechanism 4d being bent inwardly, as would occur responsive to a force applied to it, for example, from a tethered cannula or a strand, which could then enter the engagement feature 12d. As a further alternative, the capture mechanism 4d can be retracted to provide an opening for the engagement feature, instead of using a capture mechanism 4d which is flexible. Figures 45 and 46 show an alternative embodiment capture mechanism 4e and guard 25℮. The guard 25℮ is fixed and provides a surface for receiving the capture mechanism 4℮. The capture mechanism 4e is shown as a small diameter wire, but can also be made from other thin-shaped materials supportable between the upper surface of the guard 25℮ and the penetrating member 3℮. In the configuration shown, the capture mechanism 4e is retractable, and both engagement features 12e are available to receive a tethered cannula or a strand. Figures 47 and 48 show the capture mechanism 4℮ of Figures 45 and 46 advanced so that the rear or proximal engagement feature 12℮ is closed. A tethered cannula or a strand located in the rear engagement feature 12℮ before such advancement would then be captured between the capture mechanism 4e and the rear engagement feature 12℮. Figures 49 and 50 show the capture mechanism 4e advanced further, so that a tethered cannula or a strand present in the forward (or distal) engagement feature 12℮ would similarly be captured as previously described. Figures 51 and 52 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism Ilf and capture mechanism 4f. The capture mechanism Ilf is formed as a flexible hook, and is preferably made from a wire, although other constructions are also possible. The penetrating member 3f includes a slot through which the capture mechanism 4f can pass, by flexing outwardly responsive to a force applied by a tethered cannula or strand entering the engagement feature 12f. Figures 53 and 54 show the capture mechanism 4f flexing outwardly through the slot. Once the tethered cannula or strand is moved to the forward notch of the engagement feature 12f, the capture mechanism 4f returns to the position shown in Figure 51 to capture the tethered cannula or strand. In such embodiments, it is advantageous for the capture mechanism 4f to normally flex inwardly. The guard 25f in this embodiment is shown to provide a surface for the capture mechanism 4f to abut against when inwardly positioned, as shown in Figure 52. Figures 55 and 56 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism llg and capture mechanism 4g. The capture mechanism 4g includes a flexible hook which is preferably bent so the hook will elevate through a slot formed in the penetrating member 3g. A guard could also be used to force the capture mechanism 4g outwardly, through the slot in the penetrating member 3g, if desired. Figures 57 and 58 show the capture mechanism 4g in an outwardly directed position. A tethered cannula in the engagement feature 12g will flex the guard over the tethered cannula and then capture the tethered cannula with the hook in the engagement feature 12g. Figure 59 shows an alternative embodiment capture mechanism 4h and penetrating member 3h, with the capture mechanism 4h retracted within the penetrating member 3h. Advancing the capture mechanism 4h, as shown in Figures 60 and 61, creates an engagement feature 12h between the penetrating member 3h and the capture mechanism 4h, in a position ready to receive a tethered cannula or a strand. Figures 62 and 63 show the capture mechanism 4h partially retracted into the penetrating member 3h, in a position where a tethered cannula or strand is preferably captured, for example, by deflecting the capture mechanism 4h away from the engagement feature 12h. Figure 64 shows an alternative embodiment capture mechanism 4h' retracted in a penetrating member 3h" having a beveled point rotated 180 degrees from the orientation shown in Figure 60. In this embodiment, the capture mechanism 4h' is again shown as a flexible wire, although other flexible constructions can also be implemented, if desired. Figures 65 and 66 show the capture mechanism 4h' in an extended position, forming an engagement feature 12h" between the penetrating member 3h' and the capture mechanism 4h'. In this configuration, the engagement feature 12h' is open and ready to receive a tethered cannula or a strand. Figures 67 and 68 show the capture mechanism 4h' retracted into the penetrating member 3h', in a position where a tethered cannula or strand is preferably captured, for example, by deflecting the capture mechanism 4h' away from the engagement feature 12h'. Figure 69 shows an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism Hi which includes a penetrating member 3i having a helical coil section. Multiple engagement features 12i are developed between the helical coils. For purposes of simplicity, only the engagement features are identified on the top side of the penetrating member 3i, even though additional engagement features are available between the helical coils from the bottom side of the penetrating member 3i. The capture mechanism 4i is shown with a bullet nose in the front, and is retracted relative to the engagement features 12i, which are then open and available for transverse engagement with a tethered cannula or strand. Other configurations for the tip of the capture mechanism 4i are also possible, although the angled tip of the preferred embodiment is presently considered preferred to facilitate the capture of a larger diameter tethered cannula. Figure 70 shows the capture mechanism 4i inserted through the engagement features 12i of the helical coils of the penetrating member 3i. As previously indicated, a tethered cannula or a strand can be positioned between and within one of the engagement features 12i defined by the helical coils. An advancing capture mechanism 4i can come in contact with and capture a tethered cannula or strand. By using a suitably narrow cannula, the tip of the capture mechanism 4i can capture the cannula between the coils. The dimensions of the capture mechanism 4i can be selected to be sufficiently small to allow the capture mechanism to continue to advance, or to stop on the narrow cannula until the narrow cannula is withdrawn and a strand is captured between the bottom surface of the capture mechanism 4i and the helical coils. It is preferred that the dimensions of the capture mechanism 4i are sufficiently small relative to the inner dimensions of the helical coils to allow a strand to pass freely while captured. Alternatively, the helical coils could be made flexible, to expand by flexing as the capture mechanism captures the strand, although this is not presently considered to be the preferred configuration for this . Figures 71, 72 and 73 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism llj which is similar in function to the engagement mechanism 11c shown in Figures 35 and 36. The penetrating member 3j includes an engagement feature 12j. The capture mechanism 4 j is shown constructed of a flexible wire but, as previously indicated, can be of some other construction. The guard 25j in the position shown in Figure 71 prevents the capture mechanism 4j from flexing inwardly to prevent a tethered cannula or strand from entering the capture zone of the engagement feature. Figure 72 shows the guard 25j retracted and the capture mechanism 4j in a position in which a downward force applied from a tethered cannula or a strand will cause the capture mechanism 4j to flex inwardly to open the engagement feature for receiving a narrow tethered cannula or a strand, as is shown in Figure 73 (tethered cannula or strand not shown). To be noted is that the front end of the guard 25j can be angled, as shown, to lift a narrow cannula or a tether into the forward slot of the engagement feature. Figures 74, 75, 76 and 77 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism Ilk which illustrates a capture mechanism 4k having multiple engagement features 12k. The illustrated penetrating member 3k is made from a cannula with a flattened distal tip, to again provide the advantage of allowing larger dimensions for the engagement features. Figure 74 shows the capture mechanism retracted. Figure 75 shows the capture mechanism extended to receive a tethered cannula or a strand. Figure 76 shows the proximal engagement feature 12k retracted to a position where a first tethered cannula or strand would be captured, leaving the distal engagement feature 12k available to receive another tethered cannula or strand, if desired. Figure 77 shows the capture mechanism 4k retracted to a position where a tethered cannula or strand can be captured in either or both of the engagement features 12k. Figures 78, 79, 80 and 81 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism Ilk' which is similar to the engagement mechanism Ilk in Figures 74 to 76. The penetrating member 3k' is shown with a pointed tip oriented with the bevel rotated 180° relative to the tip shown in Figures 74 to 76. In this orientation, as shown in Figure 81, the proximal engagement feature 12k' is behind the penetrating member 3k' when the capture mechanism 4k' is retracted to this position. With this arrangement, a tethered cannula could not be fully retracted to this position if located in the slot of the proximal engagement feature 12k'. However, a strand would be able to bend between the capture mechanism 4k' and the penetrating member 3k' if a sufficient gap is provided between the capture mechanism 4k' and the penetrating member 3k' for a given strand thickness and bend radius. Figures 82, 83, 84 and 84 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism Ilk'' which is similar to the engagement mechanisms Ilk and Ilk'. In this embodiment, the penetrating member 3k'' is shown with a contoured tip. The advantage of this arrangement is best illustrated in Figure 85, which shows the capture mechanism 4k'' retracted to a position where tethered cannulas or strands positioned in transverse alignment within the engagement features 12k'' prior to retraction, could be captured in the engagement features. In this position, the engagement features 12k'' are not fully blocked by the penetrating member 3k'', which enables the tethered cannulas to be captured, and for the strands to be captured without necessitating bending of the strand between the walls of the capture mechanism and the penetrating member. This has the advantage of capturing a strand without exposing the strand to cutting forces that could occur if the strand is forced against a sharp bevel, either by retraction of the capture mechanism or by the insertion or withdrawal of the penetrating member with a strand present in a captured engagement feature. In Figure 85, the engagement feature 12k'' in the distal position is in a location where a captured strand would not encounter a cutting force from a sharp edge of the penetrating member 3k'' during subsequent insertion or extraction of the penetrating member 3k'' along its axis. Figures 86 and 87 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism 111 which is similar to the engagement mechanism 11c shown in Figures 35 and 36, except that there is no guard and the capture mechanism 41 is a latch capable of flexing to provide access to the engagement feature 121 when an inwardly directed force from a tethered cannula or strand is applied against it, as is shown in Figure 87 (tethered cannula or strand not shown. In this embodiment, when a narrow tethered cannula or strand slides into the forward horizontal notch of the engagement feature, the latch releases and returns to the position shown in Figure 86, and the tethered cannula or strand is captured in the engagement feature by the latch. Figures 88 and 89 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism 11m including a penetrating member 3m with an engagement feature 12m having a capture mechanism 4m which is inflatable. Figure 88 shows the capture mechanism 4m deflated, with the engagement feature 12m open to receive a tethered cannula or strand. Figure 89 shows the capture mechanism 4m inflated, for example, with a fluid or a gas, through an inflation tube 26m, which then closes of the engagement feature. As shown in Figure 89, a tethered cannula or strand in the forward notch of the engagement feature 12m would be captured by the inflated capture mechanism. Figures 90 and 91 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism 11η including a penetrating member 3η with an engagement feature 12η. The capture mechanism 4η and the guard 25η are attached to a control rod 27η. Figure 90 shows the control rod 27η in a forward position, in which the guard 25η will close off the engagement feature 12η from receiving a tethered cannula or strand. Figure 91 shows the control rod retracted, with the capture mechanism 4η flexing inwardly, responsive to an inwardly directed force exerted by a tethered cannula or strand on the capture mechanism 4η (tethered cannula or strand not shown). As the tethered cannula or strand then moves into the forward notch of the engagement feature 12η, the capture mechanism 4η will flex outwardly and capture the tethered cannula or strand within the engagement feature 12η. Figures 92 and 93 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism 11ο including a penetrating member 3ο, which is shown as a cannula with engagement features 12ο, and a capture mechanism 4ο including a coil spring which resides in the penetrating member 3ο. In Figure 92, the coil spring is attached to a fixation location 28ο. In this configuration, multiple engagement features 12ο are shown between the coils in the section of the penetrating member having a relief in the penetrating member 3ο. For the case where the spring is a tension spring, if the spring is under tension the gap between the exposed coils will widen, and the engagement features 12ο will be available to receive a tethered cannula or strand. In Figure 93, the capture mechanism 4ο is shown with the coil spring no longer in tension. In this configuration, the pitch between the spring coils is selected to capture a tethered cannula or strand between the coils. If needed, an additional compressive force can be applied to the spring to further compress the coils and capture a tethered cannula or strand. The spring used with the capture mechanism 4ο can also be a compression spring, rather than a tension spring, and in such case would initially be open to receive a tethered cannula or strand, as shown in Figure 92, followed by the application of a force to the spring to compress it for capturing a tethered cannula or strand, as shown in Figure 93. Figures 94 and 95 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism llo'. As with engagement mechanism 11ο, a capture mechanism 4o' includes coils with a fixation location 29o', and the device functions in a similar manner to the engagement mechanism llo', with the main difference being that the coils in capture mechanism 4o' are wrapped around the outside of the penetrating member 3o' instead of being located inside the penetrating member 3ο described in Figures 92 and 93. For the engagement mechanism llo', the penetrating member 3o' can be solid, if desired. Figures 96 and 97 show an alternative embodiment engagement mechanism llo'' including a penetrating member 3o'' and a capture mechanism 4o'' which includes a coil. Figure 96 shows plural engagement features 12o'' which are produced between the coils protruding from the distal tip of the penetrating member 3o''. In this state, the engagement features 12o'' are available to receive a tethered cannula or a strand. Figure 97 shows the capture mechanism 4o'' partially retracted. A strand residing in an engagement feature 12o'' will be caught between the coils and the interior of the penetrating member 3ο'' as the capture mechanism is retracted inside the penetrating member. Figure 98 is a plan view of an engagement mechanism lip having a penetrating member 3ρ with an engagement feature 12ρ and a capture mechanism 4ρ which includes a small brush in the region of the engagement feature. The brush is designed to rotate inside the penetrating member. With a strand positioned in transverse alignment in the engagement feature, against the brush, the brush is rotated to capture the strand by winding it around the brush. The strand can be initially positioned at the engagement feature with a tethered cannula, and if so, the tethered cannula must be withdrawn to expose the strand directly to the brush of the capture mechanism 4ρ. Figures 99, 100, 101 and 102 are plan views of an engagement mechanism llq having a penetrating member 3q and a capture mechanisms 4q including a series of telescoping pieces that can be positioned axially to create engagement features 12q between one or more capture mechanisms 4q or between a capture mechanism and the penetrating member. A tethered cannula or strand can be positioned in one of the engagement features 12q and then captured by the movable telescoping capture mechanism 4q. Figures 99 to 102 show an example of the progressive positioning of several telescoping capture mechanisms 4q. In this illustration, as one telescoping capture mechanism advances to capture a tethered cannula or strand in the engagement region 12q distal to the capture mechanism, another engagement region emerges proximally behind it. Figures 103, 104 and 105 are plan views of an engagement mechanism Hr including a penetrating member 3r with engagement features 12r and a capture mechanism 4r. The capture mechanism 4r includes two hook-shaped regions, one facing forward and one facing rearward. Figure 103 shows the capture mechanism in a forward position with an engagement feature 12r defined between the rear hook area and the rear of the relief in the penetrating member 3r. In this position, the apparatus is ready to receive a tethered cannula or strand in the rear-most open engagement feature 12r. In Figure 104, the capture mechanism is retracted, which captures a tethered cannula or strand in the rear engagement feature 12r shown in Figure 101 and opens up another engagement feature 12r in the front of the forward facing hook of the capture mechanism. Figure 105 shows the capture mechanism 4r partially advanced to a central position so that both of the engagement features 12r from Figures 103 and 104 are closed. Figure 106 and 107 are plan views of an engagement mechanism 11s including a penetrating member 3s, a capture mechanism 4s which includes a magnet, and a strand 20s which includes magnetically attractive particles, such as beads. If the attraction between the magnet and the magnetically attractive particles are strong enough, it is possible that no other engagement features are required. Figure 107 shows the strand magnetically coupled with the magnetic capture mechanism 4s. In order to reduce the amount of magnetic attraction required, it may be advantageous to use a penetrating member 3s with an engagement feature coupled with a magnet. For example, a magnet could be used in place of the coil shown in Figures 96 and 97 for the capture mechanism, and the magnetic capture mechanism 4s could extend from the distal tip of the penetrating member, contact a magnetically attractive strand in transverse alignment and then, with a magnetic coupling, pull the strand through the penetrating member when the penetrating member is hollow, or retain the strand with the magnetic coupling at the tip of the penetrating member. A magnetic capture mechanism could also capture a strand using magnetically attractive particles within an engagement feature defined by a slot or relief in a penetrating member at a location which is not at the tip. Figure 108 is a plan view of an engagement mechanism lit including a penetrating member 3t with an engagement feature 12t and a capture mechanism 4t having a compressible foam-like or rubber-like material. A force applied by a tethered cannula or strand at the engagement feature 12t will compress the capture mechanism and allow the tethered cannula or strand to slip into the horizontal forward notch of the engagement feature. Figures 109 and 110 show an engagement mechanism llu including a penetrating member 3u with an engagement feature 12u and a capture mechanism 4u formed of a flexible material, such as a wire, that is bent and fixed in position so that when a tethered cannula or strand is forced inwardly into the engagement feature, the capture mechanism deforms and then snaps around the tethered cannula or strand. Figures 111 and 112 show an engagement mechanism 11ν including a penetrating member 3ν with an engagement feature 12ν and a capture mechanism 4ν having jaws that can be opened or closed to receive a tethered cannula or strand. Figures 113 and 114 show an engagement mechanism llw including a penetrating member 3w with an engagement feature 12w and a capture mechanism 4w having a flexible member with barbs. Figure 113 shows the capture mechanism 4w retracted and the engagement feature 12w open to receive a tethered cannula or strand. Figure 114 shows the capture mechanism 4w extended to capture a tethered cannula or strand. Figure 115 and 116 show an engagement mechanism 11χ including a penetrating member 3χ with an engagement feature 12χ and a capture mechanism 4χ including a spring loaded ball. Figure 115 shows the spring extended and the engagement feature 12χ closed off by the ball. Figure 116 shows the ball retracted and the engagement feature 12χ open to receive a tethered cannula or strand. The spring loaded ball can either be retracted axially by the user, or passively retracted with the application of an inward force produced by a tethered cannula or strand, at the engagement feature and against the front half of the ball. Figures 117 and 118 show an engagement mechanism lly including a penetrating member 3y with an engagement feature 12y and a capture mechanism 4y which includes a sheath. In Figure 117, the sheath 4y is extended over the engagement feature, closing it off and preventing it from receiving a tethered cannula or strand. Figure 118 shows the sheath 4y retracted and the engagement feature 12y open to receive a tethered cannula or strand. The sheath 4y can also be partially extended to capture a tethered cannula or strand in the narrow horizontal notch of the engagement feature 12y. Figures 119 and 120 show an engagement tool 1ζ including a fluid pathway 30ζ for dispensing fluid through the tool, which can be useful to administer anesthetic fluids for numbing tissue, and saline solutions for opening pathways through tissue by hydro-dissection. This can be especially useful if the tip of the penetrating member is blunt. Figure 121 shows a preferred embodiment of a routing tool 30 which can be used to position a tethered cannula or strand in transverse alignment with an engagement tool. The preferred embodiment includes a body 31 coupled with a penetrating member 32. The penetrating member 32 is shown with a pointed tip, which can optionally be provided. A blunting mechanism 33 is also preferably provided, and is coupled to a carriage 36 which causes the blunting mechanism 33 to translate along the axis of the penetrating member 32 to blunt the distal tip of the penetrating member 32, as is described, for example, in the above-referenced U.S. Patent Application No. 12/384,326, and International Application No. PCT/US2010/0008 91. An actuator mechanism 34 is provided which, as shown in Figure 121, is in a raised position. When the actuator mechanism 34 is depressed, it rotates around a pivot point and teeth on the actuator mechanism engage a gear 35, which engages the linear teeth of the carriage 36 and causes the carriage and the coupled blunting mechanism 33 to advance toward the distal tip of the penetrating member 32. When the carriage advances past a certain point, a flexible arm shown toward the rear of the carriage engages the small teeth of a rotating ratchet 38, rotating the large teeth of the ratchet 38 and allowing the latch 39 to flex or spring downward into a position which prevents the carriage 39 from returning, and compressing a spring mechanism 37 for keeping the carriage engaged against the front of the latch mechanism 39. This ensures that the blunting mechanism is latched into a blunt position, and that a force applied on the tip of the blunting mechanism 33 which extends past the tip of the penetrating member will be resisted by the latch 39 and will not result in the blunting mechanism retracting and exposing the sharp tip. In this state, the compressed spring 37 causes the actuator arm to partially rotate back from its fully depressed position when the actuator arm 34 is released. However the actuator arm 34 is not allowed to fully return to its top-most position because of the latch. Partial return of the carriage allows the flexible arm to travel slightly behind the ratchet mechanism 38 while the blunting mechanism is maintained slightly forward of the tip of the penetrating member 33 and slightly back from a fully forward position. Subsequent depression of the actuator 34 toward a fully forward position causes the rear arm on the carriage to again engage the small teeth of the ratchet 38 to rotate, causing the large teeth of the ratchet 38 to engage the latch 39 and raise it to a position where the carriage 35 is free to return to a rearward position from the force of the compressed spring 37, causing the actuator 34 to raise fully and the blunting mechanism 33 to retract, and exposing the pointed tip of the penetrating member 32. Also shown is an indicator 40 which is intended to remain above the tissue and provide an indication of the location of the distal tip of the penetrating member when hidden from view by tissue. Figure 122 shows the region 122 shown in Figure 121 of the front end of the penetrating member 32. In this embodiment, the front end 42 includes the distal tip 32 of the penetrating member, which is shown as a sharp tip having a bevel which is bent slightly inwardly toward the axis of the penetrating member, which is constructed from a cannula. In this embodiment, the blunting mechanism is a cannula 33 which translates inside of the penetrating member. The blunting mechanism is shown in a retracted position, with the sharp tip of the penetrating mechanism exposed. A strand 41 is coupled to the blunting mechanism and forms a loop for subsequent coupling with the strand of a tethered cannula or to a strand not attached to a cannula. The strand 41 preferably passes through two small slots in the blunting mechanism 33, and ends of the strands are retained by the blunting mechanism, preferably by the knots 43 shown, which prevent the strand 41 from being pulled through the slots. The penetrating member 33 preferably includes one or more slots which are aligned with the slots of the blunting mechanism. The slot or slots in the penetrating member 33 are sufficiently long to allow the strand 41 to translate when the blunting mechanism translates from its forward-most position to its rear-most position responsive to operations of the mechanisms associated with the routing tool 30, as previously described. Figure 123 shows the routing tool 30 with the actuator 34 depressed and in the latched forward position, where the blunting member 33 extends forward of the distal tip of the penetrating member 32. The spring 37 is shown compressed and the latch 39 is shown engaging the carriage 36, which prevents the carriage from fully returning. The ratchet mechanism 38 is shown rotated in a position where the larger teeth of the ratchet allow the latch 39 to lower into the latching position, and the rear arm of the carriage which engages the small teeth of the ratchet 38 is shown just rear of the small teeth of the ratchet. Figure 124 shows the region 124 of Figure 124. In this configuration, the outer diameter of the blunting mechanism 33 extends forward of the tip of the penetrating member 32 and contacts the bent tip of the beveled point of the penetrating member so that the tip does not act as a catch point. Figure 125 shows the routing tool 30 coupled with a tethered cannula 24, through the looped strand 41 of the routing tool and the strand 20 of the tethered cannula 24. By inserting the routing tool through tissue, a pathway is created. A separate strand can be coupled to the routing tool and positioned along this same pathway. In this way, coupling occurs by passing a strand through the loop 41 of the routing tool. Other techniques can also be used to couple a strand to the routing tool, if desired, such as inserting the strand through the lumen of the routing tool, or tying a strand to the routing too.l directly or through a strand affixed to the routing tool, or mechanically engaging the strand to the routing tool. Figure 126 shows the region 126 of Figure 125, showing the strand 20 passing through the loop of the strand 41. The routing tool can conveniently be coupled with a strand and, when used in conjunction with the engagement tool previously described, can be used to subcutaneously manipulate strands into various configurations, including desirable loops for supporting tissue or for severing an internal structure, such as a ligament. The routing tool shown is advantageously used by inserting it through tissue and then coupling it with a tethered cannula. This can be repeated several times, if desired, to position multiple tethered cannulas through tissue for subsequent engagement by the engagement tool, as previously described. It is also possible to have the routing tool provide the initial engagement with the engagement tool by positioning the routing tool and the engagement tool in transverse alignment at the engagement feature of the engagement tool. In this configuration, subsequently coupling a strand to the routing tool can facilitate the direct coupling of the strand to the engagement tool without necessitating a separate tethered cannula. Previously, it had been indicated that a strand under tension could be advantageously used to fully engage and capture the strand in many of the described engagement mechanisms. A strand coupled with the routing tool can be held in tension to facilitate this engagement. In this arrangement, once the routing tool is coupled to the strand, the combination of the strand and the routing tool can be considered as another embodiment of a tethered cannula. Figures 127, 128 and 129 show an alternative embodiment routing tool which can also be considered a tethered cannula, and which can facilitate a more direct engagement with an engagement tool. Instead of including a strand 41 to engage a subsequent strand, the routing tool includes a strand 20a, which is shown in the front end 42a of the penetrating member 32a. For embodiments where the penetrating member 32a includes a sharp point, the blunting mechanism 33a is preferably included and the strand 20a can pass through it if it is constructed from a cannula. With the blunting mechanism 33 extended, as shown in Figure 128, the diameter of the blunting mechanism can act as a narrow cannula and can extend farther than is shown in Figure 128. This enables the routing tool to engage the engagement tool in similar fashion to a tethered cannula, where the initial engagement can occur with an outer cannula, in this case the penetrating member 32a. Progressive engagement and capture can then occur with a narrow cannula, in this case, the extended blunting cannula 33a, followed by final engagement with the strand 20a. In the embodiments shown, the strand 20a includes a tip 44a. This tip 44a can be a long continuation of the strand which extends along the outside of the penetrating member, or it can be an obstructive member, such as a knot, having a sufficient size to be retained by the engagement feature of the engagement tool after it is captured. As a further alternative, magnetic particles can be provided to facilitate engagement and capture by an engagement tool with a magnet in the engagement feature. While the illustrated mechanism is shown with several elements, the front end 42a of the penetrating member of the routing tool can also be implemented with a tethered cannula having a blunt cannula, with a strand 20a coupled with the tip 44a. The primary advantage of the arrangement shown in Figures 127, 128 and 129 is that the routing tool does not have to exit from the tissue to couple with a separate tethered cannula. Instead, it can couple directly with the engagement tool inside the tissue, which can be an advantage when further penetration of the routing tool by the penetrating member is obstructed or undesirable. Figures 130 and 131 show an alternative embodiment routing tool 30b. In this configuration, the routing tool 30b includes a fluid pathway 45b for dispensing fluid through the tool. This can be useful for the administration of anesthetic fluids for numbing tissue and saline solutions for opening pathways through tissue, for example, through hydro-dissection, which is especially useful with penetrating members having blunt tips.
