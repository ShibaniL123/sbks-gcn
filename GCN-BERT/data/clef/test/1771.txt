FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to interferon-free and ribavirin-free treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] The HCV is an RNA virus belonging to the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family. The enveloped HCV virion contains a positive stranded RNA genome encoding all known virus-specific proteins in a single, uninterrupted, open reading frame. The open reading frame comprises approximately 9500 nucleotides and encodes a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. The polyprotein comprises a core protein, envelope proteins El and Ε2, a membrane bound protein ρ7, and the ηοηstructural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. [0004] Chronic HCV infection is associated with progressive liver pathology, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic hepatitis C may be treated with peginterferon-alpha in combination with ribavirin. Substantial limitations to efficacy and tolerability remain as many users suffer from side effects, and viral elimination from the body is often incomplete. Therefore, there is a need for new therapies to treat HCV infection. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0004a] In a first aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating HCV genotype 1 infection that achieves sustained virologic response (SVR) in at least 70% of treatment-naive patients infected with HCV genotype 1, comprising administering to a patient infected with HCV genotype 1 at least two direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs), wherein the at least two DAAs comprise: the combination of (2R,6S,13aS,14aR,16aS,Z)-N-(cyclopropylsulfonyl)-6-(5-methylpyrazine-2-carboxamido)-5,16-dioxo-2-(phenanthridin-6-yloxy)-l,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,ll,13a,14,14a,15,16,16a- hexadecahydrocyclopropa[e]pyrrolo[l,2-a][l,4]diazacyclopentadecine-14a-carboxamide (Compound 1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, N-(6-(3-tert-butyl-5-(2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-l(2H)-yl)-2-methoxyphenyl)naphthalen-2-yl)methanesulfonamide (Compound 2) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and dimethyl (2S,2’S)-l,r-((2S,2’S)-2,2’-(4,4’-((2S,5S)-l-(4-tert-butylphenyl)pyrrolidine-2,5,diyl)bis(4,l-phenylene))bis(azanediyl) bis(oxomethylene)bis(pyrrolidine-2,l-diyl)bis(3-methyl-l-oxobutane-2,l-diyl)dicarbamate (Compound 4) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or the combination of PSI-7977 and GS-5885, wherein the treatment does not include administration of either interferon or ribavirin, and wherein the treatment lasts for 12 weeks.

[0004c] In some embodiments, the treatment achieves SVR in at least 90% of treatment-naive patients. In some embodiments, the method is for the treatment of a treatment-naive patient. In some embodiments, the at least two DAAs are the combination of PSI-7977 and GS-5885, the PSI-7977 is administered 400 mg QD and the GS-5885 is administered 90 mg QD. [0005] As another aspect of the present invention, methods for treating HCV infection in a subject are provided. The methods comprise administering at least two direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for a duration of no more than twelve weeks, or for another duration as set forth herein. Preferably, the duration of the treatment is twelve weeks. The duration of the treatment can also be no more than eight weeks. Preferably, the two or more direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are administered in amounts effective to provide a sustained virological response (SVR) or achieve another desired measure of effectiveness in a subject. The subject is not administered ribavirin during the duration of administering the at least two DAAs. Put another way, the methods exclude the administration of ribavirin to the subject during the treatment regimen. The subject is also not administered interferon during the treatment regimen. Put another way, the methods exclude the administration of interferon to the subject, thereby avoiding the side effects associated with interferon. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise administering an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 (such as ritonavir) to the subject to improve the pharmacokinetics or bioavailability of one or more of the DAAs. As another aspect, methods for treating HCV infection in a subject are provided. The methods comprise administering (a) therapeutic agent 1, (b) at least one polymerase inhibitor selected from the group consisting of therapeutic agent 2, therapeutic agent 3, and combinations thereof, and (c) an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 to the subject for a duration of no more than twelve weeks, or for another duration as set forth herein (e.g., the treatment regimen can last for a duration of no more than 8 weeks). Preferably, therapeutic agent 1, the polymerase inhibitor(s), and the inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 are administered in amounts effective to provide high rates of SVR or another measure of effectiveness in the subject. As non-limiting examples, therapeutic agent 1 and the inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 can be co-formulated and administered once daily, and the polymerase inhibitor(s) can be administered once daily or twice daily, and the treatment regimen preferably lasts for twelve weeks (the treatment regimen can also last, for example, for eight weeks).

[0090] The current standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of HCV includes a course of treatment of interferon, e.g. pegylated interferon (e.g., pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or pegylated interferon-alpha-2b, such as PEGASYS by Roche, or PEG-INTRON by Schering-Plough) and the antiviral drug ribavirin (e.g., COPEGUS by Roche, REBETOL by Schering-Plough, or RIBASPHERE by Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals). The treatment often lasts for 24-48 weeks, depending on hepatitis C virus genotype. Other interferons include, but are not limited to, interferon-alpha-2a (e.g., Roferon-A by Roche), interferon-alpha-2b (e.g., Intron-A by Schering-Plough), and interferon alfacon-1 (consensus interferon) (e.g., Infergen by Valeant). Less than 50% of patients with chronic HCV infection with genotype 1 virus respond to this therapy. Further, interferon therapy has many side effects that hinder patient compliance and results in premature discontinuation of the treatment. [0091] The interferon/ribavirin-based treatment may be physically demanding, and can lead to temporary disability in some cases. A substantial proportion of patients will experience a panoply of side effects ranging from a “flu-like” syndrome (the most common, experienced for a few days after the weekly injection of interferon) to severe adverse events including anemia, cardiovascular events and psychiatric problems such as suicide or suicidal ideation. The latter are exacerbated by the general physiological stress experienced by the patients. Ribavirin also has a number of side effects, including, anemia, high pill burden (e.g. 5-6 pills a day split BID) and teratogenicity restricting use in women of childbearing age. [0092] The present methods provide effective treatment of HCV infection without the use of interferon or ribavirin and for a shorter period of time, such as a treatment duration of no more than twelve weeks, alternatively no more than eleven weeks, alternatively no more than ten weeks, alternatively no more than nine weeks, alternatively no more than eight weeks, alternatively no more than seven weeks, alternatively no more than six weeks, alternatively no more than five weeks, alternatively no more than four weeks, or alternatively, no more than three weeks. [0093] In some embodiments, the present technology provides methods for treating HCV infection in a subject comprising administering at least two DAAs in the absence of interferon and ribavirin for a duration of no more than twelve weeks, alternatively no more than eight weeks. Put another way, the present methods exclude interferon and ribavirin, or the subject does not receive interferon or ribavirin for the duration of the treatment. The at least two DAAs can be co-administered or can be administered independently (with the same or different dosing frequencies) and can be administered once a day, alternatively twice a day, alternatively three times a day. [0094] In some embodiments, the methods of treatment comprise daily administration of two or more DAAs, wherein a first DAA may be administered once a day, twice a day, or three times a day, and a second DAA may be administered once a day, twice a day, or three times a day. In some embodiments, a third DAA may be administered once a day, twice a day, or three times a day. The DAAs may be co-administered or administered at different times or frequencies. Preferably, in the methods, at least two DAAs are administered in effective amounts to provide a desired measure of effectiveness in the subject. Preferably, the treatment has reduced side effects as compared with interferon-containing treatments. [0095] Various measures may be used to express the effectiveness of the present methods of HCV treatment. One such measure is rapid virological response (RVR), meaning that HCV is undetectable in the subject after 4 weeks of treatment, for example, after 4 weeks of administration of two or more of DAAs. Another measure is early virological response (EVR), meaning that the subject has >21ogi0 reduction in viral load after 12 weeks of treatment. Another measure is complete EVR (cEVR), meaning the HCV is undetectable in the serum of the subject after 12 weeks of treatment. Another measure is extended RVR (eRVR), meaning achievement of RVR and cEVR, that is, HCV is undetectable at week 4 and 12. Another measure is the presence or absence of detectable virus at the end of therapy (EOT). Another measure is SVR, which, as used herein, means that the virus is undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 8 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR8); preferably, the virus is undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 12 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR12); more preferably, the virus is undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 16 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR16); and highly preferably, the virus is undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 24 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR24). SVR24 is often considered as a functional definition of cure; and a high rate of SVR at less than 24 week post-treatment (e.g., SVR8 or SVR12) can be predictive of a high rate of SVR24. Likewise, a high rate of SVR at less than 12 week post-treatment (e.g., SVR4 or SVR8) can be predictive of a high rate of SVR12. A high rate of EOT (e.g., at week 8 or week 12) can also be indicative of a significant rate of SVR 12 or SVR24. [0096] In some embodiments, the amounts of the two or more DAAs, and/or the duration of the treatment regimen of the two or more DAAs, are effective to provide an RVR in a subject, or an EVR in a subject, or a cEVR in a subject, or an eRVR in a subject, or an absence of detectable virus at EOT in a subject. In some embodiments, the present methods comprise treating a population of subjects having HCV infection (e.g. treatment naive subjects), and the methods comprise administering at least two DAAs to the subjects for a duration of no more than 12 weeks, or for another duration disclosed herein, wherein the at least two DAAs are administered to the subjects in amounts effective to provide an SVR (e.g., SVR after 8 weeks post-treatment, or SVR after 24 weeks post-treatment) in at least about 70% of the population, alternatively at least about 75% of the population, alternatively at least about 80% of the population, alternatively at least about 85% of the population, alternatively at least about 90% of the population, alternatively at least about 95% of the population, alternatively about 100% of the population. In some embodiments, the present methods comprise treating a population of IFN experienced subjects (e.g., interferon non-responders) having HCV infection, and the methods comprise administering at least two DAAs to the subjects for a duration of no more than 12 weeks, or for another duration disclosed herein, wherein the at least two DAAs are administered to the subjects in amounts effective to provide an SVR (e.g., SVR after 8 weeks post-treatment, or SVR after 24 weeks post-treatment) in at least about 50% of the population, alternatively at least about 55% of the population, alternatively at least about 60% of the population, alternatively at least about 65% of the population. In other embodiments, the amount of DAAs and the duration of the treatment are effective to provide one or more of an SVR (e.g., SVR after 8 weeks post-treatment, or SVR after 24 weeks post-treatment), an RVR, an EVR, a cEVR, an eRVR, or an absence of detectable virus at EOT, in at least about 50% of the population, alternatively at least about 55%, in at least about 60% of the population, alternatively at least about 65% of the population, alternatively at least about 70% of the population, alternatively at least about 75% of the population, alternatively at least about 80% of the population, alternatively at least about 85% of the population, alternatively at least about 90% of the population, alternatively at least about 95% of the population, alternatively about 100% of the population. For example, the present methods comprise administering at least two DAAs in amounts and for durations effective to provide an SVR (e.g., SVR after 8 weeks post-treatment, or SVR after 24 weeks post-treatment) in a subject. In some embodiments, the present technology provides for an SVR (e.g., SVR after 8 weeks post-treatment, or SVR after 24 weeks post-treatment) in at least about 50% of the population, alternatively at least about 55% of the population, in at least about 60% of the population, preferably in at least about 65% of the population, preferably in at least about 70% of the population, preferably at least about 75% of the patients treated by such methods herein described, more preferably in at least 80% of the population, and highly preferably in at least about 90% of the patients being treated. In some embodiments, a treatment of the present technology provides an RVR or undetectable level of HCV RNA in the bloodstream at four (4) weeks of treatment (preferably in addition to a SVR). [0097] A DAA of the present technology includes, but is not limited to, a protease inhibitor, a HCV polymerase inhibitor, an HCV NS5A inhibitor, an HCV NS3B inhibitor, an HCV NS4A inhibitor, an HCV NS5B inhibitor, an HCV entry inhibitor, a cyclophilin inhibitor, a CD81 inhibitor, or an internal ribosome entry site inhibitor. The HCV polymerase inhibitor may be a nucleoside or nucleotide polymerase inhibitor or a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor. The HCV polymerase inhibitor may be a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor or a non-nucleotide polymerase inhibitor.

[0100] It was unexpected that an interferon-free and ribavirin-free treatment using a combination of two or more DAAs, and for a duration of no more than 12 weeks, can achieve significant SVR. In some cases, such a treatment can achieve an SVR in at least about 75% of patients, and in some cases, such a treatment can achieve an SVR in at least about 85% of patients, and in certain cases, such a treatment can achieve an SVR in at least about 90% of patients. It was also unexpected that an interferon-free and ribavirin-free treatment using a combination of two or more DAAs, and for a duration of no more than 12 weeks, may achieve significant SVR in interferon non-responders (e.g., null responders), for example, such a treatment may achieve an SVR in at least about 50% of patients in the interferon non-responder population, preferably at least about 60% of patients in the interferon non-responder population, more preferably at least about 65% of patients in the interferon non-responder population. [0101] Accordingly, in one aspect, the present technology features a method of treating HCV infection, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a combination of two or more DAAs. The treatment lasts 8 weeks and does not include administration of any interferon or ribavirin. The DAAs can be administered at the same or different dosing frequencies.

[0113] In another embodiment, the present technology provides interferon- and ribavirin-free treatment comprising administering daily two DAAs, where the two DAAs include a HCV polymerase inhibitor, for example PSI-7977 and a NS5A inhibitor, for example BMS-790052 for a duration of no more than twelve weeks (e.g., no more than eleven weeks), preferably no more than eight weeks. [0114] In some embodiments, the present technology provides a method of treating Hepatitis C virus infection in a subject comprising administering daily a HCV protease inhibitor and a HCV polymerase inhibitor to the subject in the absence of interferon and ribavirin for a duration of no more than twelve weeks, preferably no more than eight weeks. In some embodiments, ritonavir (or an equivalent thereof) is co-administered with one or more protease inhibitors to improve the pharmacokinetics of the protease inhibitor(s). The treatment excludes administering ribavirin to the patient. In some embodiments, the HCV polymerase inhibitor is at least one nucleoside or nucleotide polymerase inhibitor or at least one non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor. In some embodiments, both a nucleoside or nucleotide polymerase inhibitor and a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor may be administered. [0115] The methods of the present technology as described herein may be used to treat a naive patient or a treatment experienced patient. Treatment experienced patients include interferon non-responders (e.g., null responders), partial responders (patients whose HCV RNA levels declined but never became undetectable), and relapsers (patients who achieved undetectable levels of HCV RNA during therapy but rebound). Methods of the present technology may also be used to treat patients who are not candidates for interferon treatment. Patients who are not candidates for interferon treatment include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following groups: patients intolerant to interferon, patients who refuse to take interferon treatment, patients with medical conditions which preclude them from taking interferon, and patients who have an increased risk of side effects or infection by taking interferon. [0116] In some embodiments, a cytochrome P-450 inhibitor, e.g. ritonavir, is administered either in the same or separate pharmaceutical composition with the protease inhibitor (e.g. Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof)) to improve the pharmacokinetics. A cytochrome Ρ450 inhibitor reduces the metabolism of some protease inhibitors, such as Compound 1, thereby improving the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the protease inhibitor, for example Compound 1. More preferably, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is co-formulated with ritonavir in the same dosage form. Other cytochrome Ρ450 inhibitors, such as cobicistat, may also be administered in lieu of ritonavir, to enhance the pharmacokinetics of Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof). [0117] Inhibitors of cytochrome Ρ450, such as ritonavir, may be co-administered with the DAAs, either sequentially or simultaneously, in the same or different compositions. In some embodiments, the cytochrome Ρ450 inhibitors are administered in order to improve the pharmacokinetics of at least one of the DAAs. Not to be bound by any theory, but a cytochrome Ρ450 inhibitor may also reduce the development of resistant strains of HCV when co-administered with a DAA, thus providing the effectiveness in a shorter treatment. In some embodiments, ritonavir is co-administered with therapeutic agent 1. In some embodiments, ritonavir is co-administered with therapeutic agent 1 in the same compositions. [0118] In some embodiments, the present technology provides a method of treating HCV infection comprising administering at least one protease inhibitor and at least one HCV polymerase inhibitor in a course of treatment of no more than, or less than, eight weeks in the absence of interferon and ribavirin.

[0160] The one or more DAAs can be administered, for example and without limitation, concurrently or sequentially, and at the same or different frequencies. For instance, For example, one DAA can be administered immediately before or after the administration of another DAA. A short delay or time gap may exist between the administration of one DAA and that of another DAA. The frequency of administration may also be different. For example, a first DAA may be administered once a day and a second DAA may be administered twice or three times a day. For example, a first DAA with or without ritonavir may be administered once daily, and a second DAA may be administered twice daily. [0161] The DAAs of the present technology can be co-formulated in a single dosage form. Non-limiting examples of suitable dosage forms include liquid or solid dosage forms.

More preferably, the dosage form is a solid dosage form in which at least one of the DAAs is in an amorphous form, or highly preferably molecularly dispersed, in a matrix which comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymer and a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant. The other DAAs can also be in an amorphous form or molecularly dispersed in the matrix, or formulated in different form(s) (e.g., in a crystalline form). [0162] The DAAs of the present technology can be formulated in different dosage forms.

[0172] It should be understood that the above-described embodiments and the following examples are given by way of illustration, not limitation. Various changes and modifications within the scope of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the present description. Example 1. Synergistic concentrations of Compound 1 and Compound 2 in genotype lb HCV replicon assay [0173] Examples 1-3 are for illustration and do not limit the scope of this disclosure in any way. Not to be bound by any theory, the unexpected synergistic effects from combining different classes of HCV inhibitors (e.g., a combination of a protease inhibitor (such as Compound 1) and a polymerase inhibitor (such as Compound 2), or a combination of a protease inhibitor (such as Compound 1) and a NS5A inhibitor (such as Compound 4)) may contribute to the effectiveness of the short-duration, interferon- and ribavirin-free therapies of the present technology. [0174] Materials'. A replicon cell line was derived from the human hepatoma cell line Huh7. It was derived from HCV genotype lb (Coni), and is a bicistronic subgenomic replicon, essentially similar to those described in Science 285(5424): 110-3 (1999). The first cistron of the construct contains a firefly luciferase reporter and a neomycin phosphotransferase selectable marker. Replicon cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 200 mg/ml G418, an aminoglycoside antibiotic (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37° C and 5% C02. [0175] Replicon Cell Culture: Replicon cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells per well of a 96-well plate in 100 μ1 DMEM containing 5% FBS. The following day, Compounds 1 and 2 were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to generate a 200Χ stock in a series of 6 two-fold dilutions. The dilution series was then further diluted 100-fold in the medium containing 5% FBS. [0176] Combination Studies: Combination studies were performed to evaluate the interaction effects of therapeutic agent 1 and therapeutic agent 2 in the replicon assay described above. The purpose of these studies was to determine whether there are doses or concentrations of each compound where synergy or antagonism is demonstrated with the other compound. Three experiments with three plates in each experiment were performed on three separate days. Six concentrations of Compound 1 alone and six concentrations of Compound 2 alone were assayed in each plate. In addition, 36 combinations of concentrations of the two compounds were assayed for each plate. The variable analyzed was the fraction of inhibition of the luciferase signal. [0177] The dilutions of each compound were combined with the dilutions of the other compound in a checkerboard fashion. The concentrations tested were chosen to ensure that the EC50 for each compound alone is in the middle of the serial dilution range. Medium with inhibitor(s) was added to the cell culture plates already containing 100 μ1 of DMEM with 5% FBS. The cells were incubated in a tissue culture incubator at 37° C and 5% C02 for three days. The inhibitor effects of compounds on HCV replication were determined by measuring activity of a luciferase reporter gene using a Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Passive Lysis buffer (30 μ1, Promega) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 15 minutes with rocking to lyse the cells. Luciferin solution (100 μ1, Promega) was added to each well and the luciferase activity was measured using a Victor II luminometer (Perkin-Elmer). To determine the EC50, the luciferase inhibition data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Three experiments were performed with three replicates per experiment. The percent inhibition results were analyzed for synergy, additivity and antagonism according to the Pritchard and Shipman model (Antiviral Research 14:181-206 (1990)). [0178] Combination Analysis: Prichard and Shipman proposed a direct approach to solve this drugdrug interaction problem. The method was able to calculate theoretical additive effects directly from the individual dose-response curves determined in the assay. The calculated theoretical additivity was then compared to the experimental dose-response surface, and subsequently subtracted to reveal any areas of aberrant interaction. The following equation was used to calculate the theoretical additive effects: Ζ=Χ+Υ(1-Χ) = Χ+ Υ- ΧΥ , where Ζ is the total inhibition produced by the combination of drugs X and Υ, with X and Υ representing the inhibition produced by drugs X and Υ alone respectively. [0179] A difference between the actual observed fraction of inhibition and the predicted value was calculated for each concentration combination for each plate in each experiment to determine whether the observed combined effect was greater than the theoretical additive effect Ζ calculated from the equation above. For each concentration combination, the replicates (across all plates and experiments) were used to calculate a mean difference between observed and predicted fraction of inhibition, its standard error and its two-sided 95% confidence interval. [0180] Synergy or antagonism for a concentration combination was determined based on the following 2 rules: First, the 95% Cl of the mean difference between observed and predicted fraction of inhibition at each concentration combination is calculated. If the lower bound of 95% Cl is larger than zero, then the drug combination would be considered having a synergistic effect; if the upper bound of 95% Cl is less than zero, then the drug combination would be considered having an antagonistic effect; otherwise, no significant antagonism or synergy at this concentration combination. [0181] Second, the synergistic or antagonistic effect must have its relative mean difference, the absolute mean difference divided by its corresponding observed mean inhibition, greater than 1%. By doing this, small differences of statistical significance caused by very small variance could be excluded. [0182] Combination of Therapeutic Agent 1 and Therapeutic Agent 2: The inhibitory effects on replicons produced by each drug alone or in combination with the other at concentrations up to ten-fold above the EC50 were examined in the genotype lb (Coni) replicon using a checkerboard titration pattern (two-fold serial dilutions) in a standard three-day antiviral assay. The concentrations tested were chosen to ensure that the EC50 values of the compounds were in the middle of the serial dilution range. For Compound 1, concentrations ranged from 0.031 ηΜ to 1.0 ηΜ. For Compound 2, concentrations ranged from 0.125 ηΜ to 4.0 ηΜ. Synergy, additivity, and antagonism were evaluated using the Pritchard and Shipman model [0183] Results: The results of the assay analysis are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 and Table 2. In the 3-D surface plot of Figure 1, deviations from expected interactions between Compound 1 and Compound 2 are purely additive at concentrations associated with a horizontal plane at 0%. Synergistic interactions between Compound 1 and Compound 2 appear as a peak above the horizontal plane with a height corresponding to the percent above calculated additivity. Antagonistic interactions between Compound 1 and Compound 2 appear as a pit or trough below the horizontal plane with a negative value signifying the percent below the calculated additivity. Synergistic interactions appear as dark grey, additive interactions appear white, and antagonistic interactions appear as speckled. [0184] As illustrated in the 3-D surface plot of Figure 1 and the contour plot of Figure 2, an additive or synergistic effect exists at most of the concentrations for Compound 1 and Compound 2. In particular, there is a concentration region showing synergy at most concentrations of Compound 1 and at the lower to mid-range dose concentrations of Compound 2. [0185] Table 2 below lists combinations of concentrations of Compound 1 and Compound 2 with statistically significant synergistic or antagonistic effects based on the Prichard and Shipman model analysis. For each combination of concentrations, Table 2 includes the mean difference in the observed and predicted fraction of inhibition, the standard deviation or error of the mean difference, and the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval. [0186] According to Table 2, all of the combinations of Compound 1 and Compound 2 listed in the table have statistically significant synergistic effects. [0187] The results presented in Figures 1 and 2 and Table 2 demonstrate that the combination of therapeutic agent 1 and therapeutic agent 2 achieves additivity or synergy at most of the concentration combinations of the two agents. Taken together, these in vitro replicon results suggest that therapeutic agent 2 should produce a significant antiviral effect in patients when administered in combination with therapeutic agent 1 in patients infected with HCV.

Synergistic concentrations of Compound 1 and Compound 4 in genotype lb HCV replicon assay [0188] Materials: The replicon cell line was derived from the human hepatoma cell line Huh7. It was derived from HCV genotype lb (Coni), and is a bicistronic subgenomic replicon, essentially similar to those described in Science 285(5424): 110-3 (1999). The first cistron of the construct contains a firefly luciferase reporter and a neomycin phosphotransferase selectable marker. Replicon cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 200 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37° C and 5% C02. [0189] Replicon Cell Culture: Replicon cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells per well of a 96-well plate in 100 μ1 DMEM containing 5% FBS. The following day, compounds were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to generate a 200Χ stock in a series of 6 two-fold dilutions. The dilution series was then further diluted 100-fold in the medium containing 5% FBS. [0190] Combination Studies: Combination studies were performed to evaluate the interaction effects of therapeutic agent 1 and therapeutic agent 4 in the replicon assay described above. The purpose of these studies was to determine doses or concentrations of each compound where synergy or antagonism is demonstrated with the other compound. Three experiments with three plates in each experiment were performed on three separate days. Six concentrations of Compound 1 alone and six concentrations of Compound 2 alone were assayed in each plate. In addition, 36 combinations of concentrations of the two compounds were assayed for each plate. The variable analyzed was the fraction of inhibition of the luciferase signal. [0191] The dilutions of each compound were combined with the dilutions of the other compound in a checkerboard fashion. The concentrations tested were chosen to ensure that the EC50 for each compound alone is in the middle of the serial dilution range. Medium with inhibitor(s) was added to the cell culture plates already containing 100 μ1 of DMEM with 5% FBS. The cells were incubated in a tissue culture incubator at 37° C and 5% C02 for three days. The inhibitor effects of compounds on HCV replication were determined by measuring activity of a luciferase reporter gene using a Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Passive Lysis buffer (30 μ1, Promega) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 15 minutes with rocking to lyse the cells. Luciferin solution (100 μ1, Promega) was added to each well and the luciferase activity was measured using a Victor II luminometer (Perkin-Elmer). To determine the EC50, the luciferase inhibition data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Three experiments were performed with three replicates per experiment. The percent inhibition results were analyzed for synergy, additivity and antagonism according to the Pritchard and Shipman model (Antiviral Research 14:181-206 (1990)). [0192] Combination Analysis: The Prichard and Shipman approach to calculating theoretical additive effects (described in Example 1) was used for the present example. [0193] The difference between the actual observed fraction of inhibition and the predicted value was calculated for each concentration combination for each plate in each experiment to determine whether the observed combined effect was greater than the theoretical additive effect Ζ calculated from the Prichard and Shipman equation. For each concentration combination, the replicates (across all plates and experiments) were used to calculate a mean difference between observed and predicted fraction of inhibition, its standard error and its two-sided 95% confidence interval. [0194] Synergy or antagonism for a concentration combination was determined based on the same rules set forth in Example 1. [0195] Combination of Therapeutic Agent 1 and Therapeutic Agent 4: The inhibitory effects in replicon produced by each drug alone or in combination with the other at concentrations up to ten-fold above the EC50 were examined in the genotype lb (Coni) replicon using a checkerboard titration pattern (two-fold serial dilutions) in the standard three-day antiviral assay. The concentrations tested were chosen to ensure that the EC50 values of the compounds were in the middle of the serial dilution range. For Compound 4, concentrations ranged from 0.0002 ηΜ to 0.0063 ηΜ, and for Compound 1, concentrations ranged from 0.023 ηΜ to 0.75 ηΜ. Synergy, additivity, and antagonism were evaluated using the Pritchard and Shipman model. [0196] Results: The results of the assay analysis are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 and Table 3. In the 3-D surface plot of Figure 3, deviations from expected interactions between Compound 1 and Compound 4 are purely additive at concentrations associated with a horizontal plane at 0%. Synergistic interactions between Compound 1 and Compound 4 appear as a peak above the horizontal plane with a height corresponding to the percent above calculated additivity. Antagonistic interactions between Compound 1 and Compound 4 appear as a pit or trough below the horizontal plane with a negative value signifying the percent below the calculated additivity. Synergistic interactions appear as shades of dark grey, additive interactions appear white, and antagonistic interactions appear as speckled. [0197] As illustrated in the 3-D surface plot of Figure 3 and the contour plot of Figure 4, an additive or synergistic effect exists at most of the concentrations for Compound 1 and Compound 4. In particular, there is a concentration region showing synergy at the lower dose concentrations of Compound 4 and mid-range dose concentrations of Compound 1. [0198] Table 3 below lists combinations of concentrations of Compound 1 and Compound 4 with statistically significant synergistic or antagonistic effects based on the Prichard and Shipman Model analysis. For each combination of concentrations, Table 3 includes the mean difference in the observed and predicted fraction of inhibition, the standard deviation or error of the mean difference, and the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval. [0199] According to Table 3, most of the combinations of Compound 1 and Compound 4 listed in the table have statistically significant synergistic effects. A small amount of antagonism was observed at the lowest concentrations of Compound 1. [0200] The results presented in Figures 3 and 4 and Table 3 demonstrate that the combination of therapeutic agent 4 and therapeutic agent 1 achieves additivity at most of the concentration combinations of the two agents and achieves synergy at certain concentration combinations, in particular, at low concentrations of therapeutic agent 4 and mid-range concentrations of therapeutic agent 1. Taken together, these in vitro replicon results suggest that therapeutic agent 4 should produce a significant antiviral effect in patients when administered in combination with therapeutic agent 1 in patients infected with HCV.

Example 3. Reduction of HCV-infected cells with combinations of therapeutic agents 1, 2 and 4 [0202] In order to quantify the frequency of resistant replicon colonies selected by therapeutic agent 1, therapeutic agent 2, therapeutic agent 4, or various combinations of these agents, the stable subgenomic replicon cell line derived from HCV genotype la (Η77; Genbank accession number AF011751) was utilized. The replicon construct was bicistronic and the cell line was generated by introducing the constructs into cell lines derived from the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7. The replicon also has a firefly luciferase reporter and a neomycin phosphotransferase (Ν℮ο) selectable marker. The two coding regions, separated by the FMDV 2a protease, comprise the first cistron of the bicistronic replicon construct, with the second cistron containing the HCV NS3-NS5B coding region with addition of adaptive mutations E1202G, K1691R, K2040R and S2204I. This HCV replicon cell line was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% (ν/ν) fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 pg/ml streptomycin, and 200 pg/ml G418 (all from Invitrogen). la-H77 replicon cells (105-106) were plated in 150 mm cell culture plates and grown in the presence of G418 (400 pg/ml) and Compound 1, Compound 2, and/or Compound 4 at concentrations that were either 10-fold (10Χ) or 100-fold (100Χ) above the EC50 value for the HCV genotype la replicon cell line. The EC50 values for Compound 1, Compound 2, and Compound 4 used for this experiment were 0.9, 7.7, and 0.01 ηΜ, respectively. After three weeks of treatment, the majority of replicon cells were cleared of replicon RNA and, therefore, were unable to survive in the G418-containing medium since the replicon RNA included the η℮ο marker conferring G418 resistance. The cells containing resistant replicon variants survived and formed colonies, and these colonies were stained with 1% crystal violet in 10% Protocol SafeFix II reagent (Fisher Scientific), and counted. As shown in Figure 5Α, the combination of Compound 4 plus either Compound 1 or Compound 2 at either 10-fold or 100-fold above their respective EC50 value resulted in significantly fewer colonies than either Compound 1, Compound 2, or Compound 4 alone at 10-fold or 100-fold above their respective EC50 value. [0203] Figure 5Β illustrates the percentage of colonies surviving two vs. three DAA combinations. In colony survival assays, la-H77 replicon cells were grown in the presence of a DAA combination and G418 for approximately three weeks, after which time the cells containing resistant replicon variants had formed colonies. The cells were stained with crystal violet and counted. “Triple Combination” is either a combination of Compounds 1, 2 and 4 at concentrations of 5-fold (5Χ) over their respective EC50 values, or a combination of Compounds 1, 2 and 4 at concentrations of 10-fold (10Χ) over their respective EC50 values. [0204] Figures 5C and 5D show the effect of a combination of Compounds 1 and 4 in long-term HCV RNA reduction assays in genotype 1 replicon cell lines. In long-term replicon RNA reduction assays, 106 replicon cells were plated in the absence of G418. The inhibitors at concentrations of either 10-fold (10Χ) or 100-fold (100Χ) over their respective EC50 values were added, and the cells were grown to approximately 95% confluence (4 days). At each passage, 106 cells were removed and frozen, and an additional 106 cells were passed into another flask with fresh media and inhibitors. RNA was extracted from 106 cells and HCV RNA was measured in a Real-Time RT-PCR assay. Figures 5C and 5D show that in both la and lb replicon cells, the combination of Compounds 1 and 4, each at 10-fold over EC50, is more effective at clearing cells of replicon than 100-fold over EC50 of either inhibitor alone. [0205] Predominant resistant variants selected by Compound 1, 2, or 4 in genotype 1 replicons were also determined. For Compound 1, the predominant resistance variants in la-H77 replicons include R155K, D168A and D168V with fold resistance of 26, 48 and 128, respectively; and the predominant resistance variants in lb-Conl replicons include R155K, Α156Τ and D168V with fold resistance of 48, 9 and 190, respectively. For Compound 2, the predominant resistance variants in la-H77 replicons include C316Y, Μ414Τ, Y448C and S556G with fold resistance of 1600, 36, 980 and 15, respectively; and the predominant resistance variants in lb-Conl replicons include C316Y, Μ414Τ and D559G with fold resistance of 1400, 26 and 100, respectively. For Compound 4, the predominant resistance variants in la-Η77 replicons include Μ28Τ, M28V, Q30R, Y93C and Υ93Η with fold resistance of 9000, 60, 800, 1700 and 41000, respectively; and the predominant resistance variants in lb-Conl replicons include Υ93Η with fold resistance of 55. These experiments also showed that in genotype la, a number of variants selected by Compounds 2 or 4 conferred higher levels of resistance than those selected by Compound 1, and that in genotype lb, one variant (C316Y) selected by Compound 2 conferred a higher level of resistance than those selected by either Compound 1 or Compound 4. [0206] The above examples show that the combination of two different classes of DAAs (e.g., a combination of a HCV protease inhibitor and a HCV polymerase inhibitor, or a combination of a HCV protease inhibitor and a HCV NS5A inhibitor, or a combination of a HCV polymerase inhibitor and a HCV NS5A inhibitor) can lead to an improved resistance barrier in patients relative to a single DAA alone, while the combination of three different classes of DAAs (e.g., a combination of a HCV protease inhibitor, a HCV polymerase inhibitor, and a HCV NS5A inhibitor) can lead to even more significant barrier to resistance. Improvement in the barrier to resistance achieved through co-administration of multiple DAAs of different classes or with different mechanism of action is expected to correlate with enhanced efficacy in patients. Example 4. Use of 2-DAA Combination without Interferon and Ribavirin to Treat Treatment-Naive Subjects Infected with Genotype 1,2 or 3 Genotype 1 [0207] Ten previously untreated subjects infected with HCV genotype 1 were treated with a 2-DAA combination for 12 weeks. The treatment was interferon- and ribavirin-free and was designed to last for 12 weeks. The 2-DAA combination included Compound 1/r (200/100 mg QD) and Compound 4 (25 mg QD). At week 3 the treatment, seven of the ten subjects showed no detectable HCV RNA; and the remaining three subjects had HCV RNA levels of less than 25 IU/mL. At week 4, eight subjects showed no detectable HCV RNA, and the remaining two showed (or were believed to have) an HCV RNA level of less than 25 IU/mL. At week 5, nine subjects had no detectable HCV RNA and the remaining one had an HCV RNA level of less than 25 IU/mL. At weeks 6 and 7 of the treatment, all ten subjects were tested and found no detectable HCV RNA. At weeks 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the treatment, one subject showed viral rebound (breakthrough), and the remaining nine subjects showed no detectable HCV RNA. [0208] At post-treatment week 2, at least seven subjects found no detectable HCV RNA. At post-treatment week 4, seven subjects found no detectable HCV RNA. At post-treatment week 8, seven subjects found no detectable HCV RNA. At post-treatment week 12, six subjects found no detectable HCV RNA. At post-treatment week 24, at least two subjects found no detectable HCV RNA. Genotype 2 [0209] Ten previously untreated subjects infected with HCV genotype 2 were treated with the same regimen of this Example. At week 3 of the treatment, eight of the ten subjects showed no detectable HCV RNA, one had viral rebound, and one had HCV RNA levels of less than 25 IU/mL. At week 5 of the treatment, nine of the ten subjects showed no detectable HCV RNA, and one had breakthrough. At weeks 10, 11 and 12 of the treatment, at least seven of the ten subjects were tested and found no detectable HCV RNA. [0210] At post-treatment week 2, six subjects found no detectable HCV RNA; and two more subjects had breakthrough. At post-treatment week 4, five subjects found no detectable HCV RNA. At post-treatment week 8, six subjects found no detectable HCV RNA. At post-treatment week 4, at least five subjects found no detectable HCV RNA. Genotype 3 [0211] Similarly, ten previously untreated subjects infected with HCV genotype 3 were treated with the same regimen of this Example. At weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the treatment, two subjects showed no detectable HCV RNA. At post-treatment weeks 2 and 4, the same two subjects were confirmed with no detectable HCV RNA. A number of subjects appeared to have breakthrough during the treatment. [0212] At post-treatment week 24, at least three subjects showed no detectable HCV RNA. Example 5. Use of 3-DAA Combination without Interferon and Ribavirin to Treat Treatment-Naive Subjects Infected with Genotype 1 [0213] Twelve previously untreated subjects with HCV genotype 1 infection were treated with a 3-DAA combination for 12 weeks. The treatment was interferon- and ribavirin-free. The 3-DAA combination included Compound 1/r (150/100 mg QD), Compound 2 (400 mg BID), and Compound 4 (25 mg QD). The weight based dosing of ribavirin ranged from 1000 to 1200 mg divided twice daily. [0214] At week 3 of the treatment, seven of the twelve subjects had no detectable HCV RNA, and the five remaining subjects had HCV RNA levels of less than 25 IU/mL. At week 4 of the treatment, nine of the twelve subjects had no detectable HCV RNA, and the three remaining subjects had HCV RNA levels of less than 25 IU/mL. At weeks 6 and 8, all twelve subjects had no detectable HCV RNA. At weeks 10 and 12, eleven of the twelve subjects showed no detectable HCV RNA, and one subject had detectable HCV RNA. [0215] At post-treatment weeks 2 and 4, at least ten of the twelve subjects were tested and found no detectable HCV RNA. At post-treatment week 8, at least seven of the twelve subjects were tested and found no detectable HCV RNA. Two subjects appeared to have breakthrough during or after the treatment. Further testing showed that at post-treatment weeks 12, at least nine of the initial twelve subjects found no detectable HCV RNA. [0216] A larger clinical study using the same drug combination showed about 91% (or about 97% if non-virologic failures were removed) SVR4 rate, and about 82% (or about 90% if non-virologic failures were removed) SVR12 rate, after 12-week treatment regimen in treatment-naive patients. Among these patients, the SVR4 and SVR12 rates (non-virologic failures removed) in genotype la patients were about 96% and 86%, respectively. All of these SVR4 and SVR12 rates were based on observed data. Example 6. Clinical Modeling for Interferon-free DAA Combination Therapies [0217] This example describes a novel clinical model for evaluating optimal doses and durations of interferon-free HCV therapies using combinations of different DAAs. This model reasonably predicted the effectiveness of numerous DAA combinations in interferon-free, short-duration therapies. [0218] A mechanistic model was used to model the relationship between DAA exposures and antiviral efficacy in HCV-infected subjects. This model was used to conduct clinical trial simulations of clinical outcomes following administration of various DAA combination regimens (e.g., specific DAA combinations and different doses of DAAs) and durations of therapy. [0219] Numerous DAAs have been extensively documented to select mutants following short duration of monotherapy (e.g., less than 1 week). The viral dynamic model of this Example included single and double mutants. Specifically, the model included 2 single mutants and one double mutant for each of the 2-DAA combination regimens. Thus, a 2-DAA combination regimen (e.g., a combination of a protease inhibitor and a NS5A inhibitor) included 2 single mutants and one double mutant. A 3-DAA combination (e.g., a combination of a protease inhibitor, a polymerase inhibitor and a NS5A inhibitor, such as a combination of a protease inhibitor, a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor (NNPI) and a NS5A inhibitor) included 3 single and 2 double mutants. [0220] The model has 3 components: hepatocytes (uninfected or target cell), infected cell and viral dynamics. The differential equations describing the dynamics of the 3 components are as follows: (1) Hepatocytes (Uninfected or Target Cell) Dynamics dT/dt = s - de*T- (l-r|)*p*T*(VLWT + VLPoly + VLProt + VLNS5A + VLNS5AProt + VLPolyProt) (2) Infected Cell Dynamics (a) Infected with Wild type Virus d IWT/dt = (l-r|)*P *T* VLWT - δ *IWT (h) Infected with Polymerase Mutant Virus d IPoly/dt = (l-r|)*P *T*VLPoly - 5*IPoly (c) Infected with Protease Mutant Virus d IProt/dt = (1 -η)*β *T*VLProt - δ *IProt (d) Infected with NS5A Mutant Virus d INS5A/dt = (1-η)^β *T*VLNS5A - δ *INS5A (℮) Infected with Protease-NS5A Double Mutant Virus d INS5AProt/dt = (1-η)=·=β *T*VLNS5AProt - δ *INS5AProt (β Infected with Protease- Polymerase Double Mutant Virus d IPolyProt/dt = (l-r|)*p*T*VLPolyProt - δ *IPolyProt (3) Viral dynamics (a) Wild Type Virus d VLWT/dt = (l-3^)*p*(l-Effl)*IWT + μ *(p*(l-Eff2)*Fitl*IPoly + p*(l-EfB)*Fit2*IProt + p*(l-Eff4)*Fit3*INS5A)- c*VLWT (b) Polymerase Mutant Virus d VLPoly/dt = (1- μ -(]))* p*(l-Eff2)*Fitl*IPoly + μ * p*(l-Effl)*IWT + φ * p*(l-Eff5)*Fit4* IPolyProt - c*VLPoly (c) Protease Mutant Virus d VLProt/dt = (1- μ - 2*(]))* p*(l-EfG)*Fit2*IProt + μ * p*(l-EfB)*IWT + φ *(p*(l-Eff5)*Fit4*IPolyProt + p*(l-Eff6)*Fit5*INS5AProt) - c*VLProt (d) NS5A Mutant Virus d VLNS5A/dt = (1- μ - φ)*p*(l-Eff4)*Fit3*INS5A + μ *p*(l-Effl)*IWT + φ *p*(l-Eff6) * Fit5 * IN S 5 AProt - c*VLNS5A (℮) NS5A and Protease Double Mutant Virus d VLNS5AProt/dt = (1-2* φ)*p*(l-Eff6)*Fit5*INS5AProt + φ *(p*(l-Eff4)*Fit3*INS5A + p*(l-EfG)*Fit2*IProt) - c*VLNS5AProt (β Poly and Protease Mutant Double Mutant Virus d VLPolyProt/dt = (1-2* (]))*p*(l-Eff5)*Fit4*IPolyPrc>t + φ *(p*(l-Ef£2)*Fitl*IPoly + p*(l-Eff3)*Fit2*IProt) - c*VLPolyProt [0221] The parameters used in the above equations are described in Table 5.

For example, the effect of DAA(s) on production of wild type virus is given as (1-Effl)* ρ where Efifl is the fraction of viral production that is inhibited. In the absence of drug Effl=0 and in the presence of drug Effl takes a value between 0 and 1. Efifl is described using an Emax model: Effl = Emax*Conc/(EC50 + Cone) where Emax represents maximum inhibition, Cone is the plasma DAA concentration and EC50 is the concentration that inhibits viral load production by 50%. As the fold-change in EC50 for the mutants compared to wild type virus was based on values obtained from in vitro replicon studies, EC50 was estimated only for wild type virus. [0223] For DAA combinations, the effect was assumed to be multiplicative and incorporated as follows: (1-Effl) = (l-EffDAA1)*(l-EffDAA2)*(l-EffDAA3) [0224] The effect of ribavirin (RBV) can also be added on infection rate β as an Emax model. In presence of ribavirin, the infection rate decreases by a factor (1-η) where η = ConcRBv /( EC50-RBV + ConcRBv) [0225] The model does not include a double mutant to the polymerase + Ν S5A inhibitors. In a 3-DAA regimens, a polymerase + NS5A double mutant is often wild type for the protease inhibitor. Hence, this double mutant is not expected to significantly affect clinical outcomes for a 3-DAA regimen simulation. On the other hand, the model can be readily adapted to simulate a 2-DAA regimen containing a polymerase inhibitor and a NS5A inhibitor by treating the polymerase inhibitor (e.g., PSI-7977) as a protease inhibitor in the model. [0226] The lowest available limit of detection (LOD) of viral load assays is 10 IU/mL. Assuming 3 virion particles per IU, this constitutes about 0.5 million viruses in the body at LOD. Hence, subjects have to be treated for significant period of time after their viral load falls below the LOD to achieve cure. This duration depends on the potency of the compounds and the individual response to therapy. [0227] In order to predict the duration required for cure, a “threshold” concept was used. For simulations, an HCV-infected subject was assumed to achieve SVR when viral load reaches less than 1 virion in the total plasma and extracellular fluid volume (about 15000 mL), i.e., viral load measurement of <1 copy/15000 mL or <0.33 IU/15000 mL. This translates to about 5 log IU/mL. Cf. Snoeck Ε el αℓ., Clin Pharmacol Ther. 87(6):706-13 (2010), wherein based on data from patients treated with peg-IFN and ribavirin, subjects were estimated to achieve SVR when the predicted number of infected cells fell below 1. While such low viral loads cannot be measured experimentally, they can be simulated using the viral dynamic model. [0228] The model can be used to predict SVR for any combination of DAAs, with or without interferon, and with or without ribavirin. [0229] As non-limiting examples, various interferon-free treatment regimens using different combinations of Compound 1, Compound 2 and/or Compound 4, with or without ribavirin, were evaluated using the model of this Example. The following approach was used to include mutants in the model: a. One single mutant per DAA b. One double mutant per DAA combination [0230] For a combination of two DAAs, e.g., a combination of Compound 1 and Compound 2, the model included one mutant resistant to Compound 1, one mutant resistant to Compound 2, and one double mutant resistant to both Compound 1 and Compound 2. Compound 1 is coadministered or co-formulated with ritonavir (or another pharmacokinetics enhancer) to improve its drug exposure. [0231] A double mutant to Compound 2 and Compound 4 was not included in the modeling. In the 3-DAA regimens, a Compound 2/Compound 4 double mutant is likely wild type for Compound 1 due to the high potency and resistant profile of Compound 1. Hence, the Compound 2/Compound 4 double mutant is not expected to affect clinical outcomes for treatments containing Compound 1. [0232] Single mutants included in the model were based on mutants observed for the individual DAAs in the Phase lb and 2a studies (e.g., clinical studies Μ10-351, Μ12-116, and Ml 1-602). For double mutants with resistance to 2 DAA classes, the sensitivity (EC50) of double mutants to drug was assumed to be a combination of the 2 single mutants. Thus, for Compound 1 and Compound 2, the single mutants were D168V and Μ414Τ, respectively, and the double mutant was D168V-M414T. In this scenario, the D168V mutant would be less sensitive to Compound 1 but would be as sensitive to Compound 2 as wild type virus. Similarly, the Μ414Τ mutant would be less sensitive to Compound 2 but would be as sensitive to Compound 1 as wild type virus. The double mutant D168V-M414T would be less sensitive to both Compound 1 and Compound 2. [0233] The fold change in EC50 for the mutants compared to wild type virus was based on values obtained from in vitro replicon studies. Since monotherapy data for Compound 4 indicated a variety of mutants with different EC50s, a value of 1000χ fold change in EC50 was used for Compound 4 for modeling and simulations. [0234] Baseline prevalence of the mutants was estimated during model fitting, while the mutation rate was based on the literature values. Both baseline prevalence and mutation rate determined mutant fitness. [0235] Pharmacokinetic data and viral load data from 140 treatment-naive HCV-infected subjects were used to construct the model. For modeling, number of target cells at baseline, number of infected cells at baseline, death rate of target cells and mutation rates were based on literature values. See, e.g., Snoeck et al. supra', Rong et αℓ. Sci Transl Med. 2(30):30ra32 (2000); Neal and Pravin, ACOP 2009 (http://2009.go-acop.org/sites/all/assets/webform/Lauren-Neal_ACoP_2009.pdf); Neumann et al. Science 282(5386): 103-7 (1998); Shudo et al. Antivir Ther. 13(7):919-26 (2008); and Dahari et al. J THEOR Biol. 247(2):371-81 (2007). The production rate of virus and infection rate of virus were derived from other parameters in the model. All other parameters were estimated. Exposure-antiviral response modeling was performed using NONMEM 7.2. [0236] Clinical trial simulations were performed using Trial Simulator version 2.2.1. Fifty subjects and 50 replicates were simulated for each treatment. A subject drop out rate from the study due to any reason was assumed to be 8% over 24 weeks based on available literature on trials in subjects with HCV. All simulations were conducted assuming 100% compliance. Covariates included in the simulations were genotype la/lb status. Clinical outcomes simulated included: (1) percentage of subjects below limit of detection (LOD) of 10 IU/mL and (2) percentage of subjects achieving SYR. [0237] Clinical trial simulations were conducted to determine optimal dose and duration for SVR. Over 80 scenarios were simulated to predict the percentage of subjects with SVR following administration of various 2- and 3-DAA combinations (e.g., Compound 1 + Compound 2, or Compound 1 + Compound 4, or Compound 1 + Compound 2 + Compound 4), without RBV, at a range of doses for each DAA (e.g., Compound 1/ritonavir at 250/100, 150/100 or 100/100 mg QD, Compound 4 at 5, 25 or 100 mg QD, and Compound 2 at 400 or 800 mg BID) and across a range of treatment durations (e.g., 2. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 weeks). [0238] Optimal dose and duration were predicted based on percentage of subjects with viral load of less than -51og IU/mL threshold for SVR. Selected and relevant results of simulation for the 2- and 3-DAA combinations of Compounds 1, 2 and/or 4 are shown in Figures 6Α, 6Β and 6C for two different doses of Compound 1. Figure 6Α shows the predicted median SVR percentage (“% SVR”) and 90% confidence interval (the vertical bar at the top of each SVR percentage column) for different treatment durations using a combination of Compound 1 and Compound 2; Figure 6Β shows the predicted median and 90% confidence interval for different treatment durations using a combination of Compound 1 and Compound 4; and Figure 6C shows the predicted median and 90% confidence interval for different treatment durations using a combination of Compound 1, Compound 2 and Compound 4. In each simulation, RBV was included, and Compound 1 was used with 100 mg ritonavir, and the subjects are HCV genotype 1, treatment-naive patients. SVR24 is lower than SVR12 in some cases due to drop out; longer durations are not necessarily predicted to improve SVR but could result in more dropouts resulting in lower SVR. [0239] The model predicted that with 8-12 weeks of dosing at least 80 to 90% subjects can achieve SVR with 2 and 3 DAA combinations. The model also predicted that durations shorter than 8 weeks can cure a significant number of subjects. A 2-DAA regimen was predicted to cure over 40% of the subjects and a 3-DAA regimen was predicted to cure about 60% of the subjects with only 6 weeks of dosing. Dosing for durations of over 12 weeks was not expected to increase the percentage of subjects with SVR significantly. Addition of the 3rd DAA was predicted to shorten treatment duration by 2 to 4 weeks as optimal durations for the 3-DAA combination of Compound 1, Compound 2 and Compound 4 were predicted to be 8-10 weeks. [0240] Figures 6Α, 6Β and 6C illustrate the predictions for DAA combinations without ribavirin. The model also predicts similar or comparable SVR percentages for these DAA combinations when used with ribavirin. In addition, the effect of interferon (e.g., pegylated interferon) can also be added by incorporating interferon similar to a DAA but without any resistant mutants. [0241] One of the advantages that the model provides is that it allows examination of various viral parameters and its effect on dose, duration and SVR. For example while experimentally determining the effect of mutants parameters is very difficult if not impossible, they can be examined using the model. Thus SVR in patient population that have different mutants can be predicted with the model. [0242] The model was used to simulate a treatment regimen which included 150/100 mg Compound 1/ritonavir QD + 400 mg Compound 3 QD + weight-based amounts of RBV BID for 12 weeks. Subjects under the treatment included 11 treatment naive subjects between the ages of 18 and 65. All subjects completed 12 weeks of therapy with Compound 1 and ritonavir (Compound 1/r) dosed in combination with Compound 3 and ribavirin (RBV). Compound 1 (150 mg once daily (QD)) was dosed with 100 mg QD ritonavir, 400 mg QD Compound 3, and weight-based amounts of RBV in treatment naive subjects infected with genotype (GT) 1 HCV. The percentage of subjects with HCV RNA less than LOD at 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12 weeks was summarized in Figure 7. The mean predicted versus observed percentage of subjects with below LOD (“% LOD”) at respective weeks are shown Figure 7. 95% confidence intervals for the predicted data (the vertical bar at the top of each respective predicted LOD percentage column) were also indicated. As shown in Figure 7, the model reasonably predicted the clinical outcome of %LOD. [0243] The model was also used to simulate another treatment regimen. The regimen included three groups of patients. In Group 1, previously untreated subjects having HCV infection were treated with a protease inhibitor (in combination with ritonavir), a polymerase inhibitor, and ribavirin. The treatment was without interferon. Subjects included 19 treatment naive subjects between the ages of 18 and 65. One subject discontinued the study at week 3. All of the remaining 18 subjects completed 12 weeks of therapy with Compound 1/r dosed in combination with Compound 2 and RBV. Compound 1 (250 mg QD) was dosed with 100 mg QD ritonavir, 400 mg BID Compound 2, and RBV in treatment naive subjects infected with GT1 HCV. [0244] In Group 2, previously untreated subjects having HCV infection were treated with a protease inhibitor (in combination with ritonavir), a polymerase inhibitor, and ribavirin. The treatment was without interferon. Subjects included 14 treatment naive subjects between the ages of 18 and 65. One subject discontinued the study at week 1. Therefore, a total of 13 subjects were under study. All of the thirteen subjects completed 12 weeks of therapy with Compound 1/r dosed in combination with Compound 2 and RBV. Compound 1 (150 mg QD) was dosed with 100 mg QD ritonavir, 400 mg BID Compound 2, and RBV in treatment naive subjects infected with GT1 HCV. [0245] In Group 3, peginterferon + ribavirin (P/RBV) non-responders were treated with a protease inhibitor (in combination with ritonavir), a polymerase inhibitor, and ribavirin. The treatment was without interferon. Subjects included 17 P/RBV non-responders between the ages of 18 and 65. Subjects were treated with Compound 1/r dosed in combination with Compound 2 and RBV for 12 weeks. Compound 1 (150 mg QD) was dosed with 100 mg QD ritonavir, 400 mg BID Compound 2, and RBV in P/RBV non-responders infected with GT1 HCV. During the treatment, four patients had breakthroughs and discontinued the study before week 7. [0246] The mean predicted versus observed percentage SVR (“% SVR”) after 12-week treatment are shown Figure 8. 95% confidence intervals for the predicted data (the vertical bar at the top of each respective predicted SVR percentage column) were also indicated. As shown in Figure 8, the predicted SVR percentages aligned well with the observed SVR percentages. Simulations also predict that the same treatment regimen but without ribavirin has similar or comparable LOD percentages for different treatment durations. [0247] The exposure response viral dynamic model of this Example provided a quantitative method to reasonably predict SVR for various combination of antiviral compounds. Based on the exposure-antiviral response modeling and clinical trial simulations, it demonstrated that (1) addition of a 3rd DAA to a 2-DAA combination can reduce optimal duration of treatment and/or increase SVR; (2) 8-12 weeks of dosing is the optimal duration of therapy for 2 and 3 DAA combinations of Compound 1/r, Compound 2 and Compound 4; and (3) durations shorter than 8 weeks of interferon-free treatment have been predicted to cure a significant percent of the subjects. Example 7. Clinical Modeling for Interferon-free DAA Combination Therapies Containing BMS-790052 and BMS-650032 [0248] The model described above was also used to predict the SVR percentage of interferon-free treatment regimens containing BMS-790052 and BMS-650032 without ribavirin, based on existing published clinical data including two Phase 1 and one Phase 2 study of BMS-790052 and one Phase 1 and one Phase 2a study of BMS-650032. Figure 9 shows the predicted median SVR percentage and 90% SVR confidence interval for different treatment durations of a 2-DAA regimen containing BMS-790052 (60 mg QD) and BMS-650032 (600 BID) in genotype 1 naive subjects. The combination of BMS-790052 (60 mg QD) plus BMS-650032 (600 mg BID) in genotype 1 subjects was predicted to achieve improved SVR for durations of 12 weeks or greater with predicted SVR rates of about 70% for 10 weeks of dosing. Similar regimens but containing ribavirin, or regimens with similar dosings of BMS-790052 and BMS-650032 with or without ribavirin, are expected to achieve similar SVR rates. Example 8. Clinical Modeling for Interferon-free Therapies Containing PSI-7977 [0249] Likewise, a 3-DAA regimen without interferon and ribavirin was modeled for genotype 1 patients based on existing clinical data. The 3-DAA regimen contains 200/100 mg QD Compound 1/r, 50 mg QD Compound 4, and 400 mg QD PSI-7977. Figure 10 depicts the predicted median SVR rates for different treatment durations of this 3-DAA combination. This 3-DAA combination was predicted to have over 60% SVR in 6 weeks and over 80% SVR at duration of 8-week, 10-week, 12-week or longer treatment. Similar regimens but containing ribavirin, or regimens with similar dosings of Compound 1/r, Compound 4 and PSI-7977 with or without ribavirin, are expected to achieve similar SVR rates. [0250] The model can also be used to predict SVR for regimens containing single DAA or single DAA with ribavirin. For example, the model predictions for PSI-7977 + ribavirin for various durations for treating HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive patients were obtained. Figure 11 depicts the predicted median and 90% confidence interval of SVR percentage for different treatment durations of such a regimen containing PSI-7977 (as the sole DAA; 400 mg QD) and ribavirin (600 mg BID). The 90% confidence interval for the predicted SVR (the vertical bar at the top of each respective predicted SVR percentage column) is also indicated in Figure 11. The prediction was based on the already published clinical data for PSI-7977. SVR rate for PSI-7977 + ribavirin was predicted to be around 75-90% following 12 weeks of dosing, and about 55-75% following 8 weeks dosing, in genotype 1 subjects. Similar SVR percentages for genotype 1 treatment-naive patients are expected for similar regimens containing similar PSI-7977 QD dosing (e.g., 200-600 mg QD) but without ribavirin. [0251] Data from two Phase 1 and one Phase 2 study of Daclatasvir (BMS-790052) and one Phase 1 and one Phase 2 study of PSI-7977 were used for estimating the pharmacokinetic and viral dynamic model parameters. Predictions for a 2-DAA combination with Daclatasvir (BMS-790052) and PSI-7977 in genotype 1 naive patients are shown in Figure 12. The model predicted that following 10-12 weeks of dosing with the combination of Daclatasvir and PSI-7977 without ribavirin, at least 90% of HCV genotype 1 naive patients can achieve SVR. [0252] Similarly, data from one Phase la study of TMC-435 and one Phase 1 and one Phase 2 study of PSI-7977 were used for estimating the pharmacokinetic and viral dynamic model parameters. Predictions for a 2-DAA combination with the TMC-435 and PSI-7977 in genotype 1 naive patients are shown in Figure 13. The model predicts that following 10-12 weeks of dosing with the combination of TMC-435 and PSI-7977 without ribavirin, at least 90% of HCV patients can achieve SVR. Example 9. Clinical Modeling for Interferon-free DAA Combination Therapies Containing Danoprevir and Mercitabine [0253] In addition, data from one Phase 1 and one Phase 2 study of Danoprevir and Mercitabine were used for estimating the pharmacokinetic and viral dynamic model parameters. Ritonavir was co-administered with danoprevir to improve the pharmacokinetics of danoprevir. Predictions for a 2-DAA combination with Danoprevir and Mercitabine in genotype 1 naive patients are shown in Figure 14. The model predicts that following 16 weeks of dosing with the combination of Danoprevir and Mercitabine without ribavirin, at least 90% of HCV patients can achieve SVR. Example 10. Clinical Modeling for Interferon-free DAA Combination Therapies Containing Tegobuvir (GS-9190), GS-9451 and GS-5885 [0254] Data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of GS-9190 (tegobuvir), GS-9451 and GS-5885 were used for estimating the pharmacokinetic and viral dynamic model parameters. Predictions for the combination with GS-9190 (tegobuvir), GS-9451 and GS-5885 and without ribavirin in genotype 1 naive patients are shown in Figure 15. The model predicts that following 12 weeks of dosing with the combination of GS-9190 (tegobuvir) + GS-9451 + GS-5885 + RBV and without ribavirin, about 70% of genotype 1 naive patients can achieve SVR and following 24 weeks of treatment > 80% of genotype 1 naive patients can achieve SVR. Example 11. Clinical Modeling for Interferon-free DAA Combination Therapies Containing PSI-7977 (GS-7977) [0255] Data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of GS-9451 and GS-7977 (PSI-7977) were used for estimating the pharmacokinetic and viral dynamic model parameters. Predictions for the combination with GS-9451 and GS-7977 (PSI-7977) and without ribavirin in genotype 1 naive patients are shown in Figure 16. [0256] Data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of GS-5885 and GS-7977 (PSI-7977) were used for estimating the pharmacokinetic and viral dynamic model parameters. Predictions for the combination with GS-5885 and GS-7977 (PSI-7977) and without ribavirin in genotype 1 naive patients are shown in Figure 16. [0257] Data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of GS-9451, GS-5885 and GS-7977 (PSI-7977) were used for estimating the pharmacokinetic and viral dynamic model parameters. Predictions for the combination with GS-9451, GS-5885 and GS-7977 (PSI-7977) and without ribavirin in genotype 1 naive patients are shown in Figure 16. [0258] The model predicts that following 12 weeks of dosing with the combination of GS-9451 and GS-7977 (PSI-7977), or the combination of GS-5885 and GS-7977 (PSI-7977), or the combination of GS-9451, GS-5885 and GS-7977 (PSI-7977), and in the absence of ribavirin, at least 90% of genotype 1 naive patients can achieve SVR. Example 12. Clinical Modeling for Interferon-free DAA Combination Therapies Containing TMC-43 and Daclatasvir (BMS-790052) [0259] Data from one Phase la study of TMC-435 and from two Phase 1 and one Phase 2 study of daclatasvir (BMS-790052) were used for estimating the pharmacokinetic and viral dynamic model parameters. Predictions for the combination with TMC-435 and daclatasvir in genotype 1 naive patients are shown in Figure 17. [0260] The model predicts that following 12 weeks of dosing with the combination of TMC-435 and daclatasvir (BMS-790052), about 80% of genotype 1 naive patients can achieve SVR.
