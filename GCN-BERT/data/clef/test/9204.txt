Preparation Example 3-2 : Preparation of methyl 6-bromo-3-hydroxypicolinate (LXVI)
Methyl 3-hydroxypicolinate (4.62 g, 30.17 mmol) was dissolved in distilled water (200 mL). To the resulting solution was slowly added dropwise bromine water (1.7 mL, 33.18 mmol) and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 hrs. The solution was diluted with ethylacetate and washed with water. The washed organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethylacetate = 3/1) to give the white title compound (5.07 g, 72 %).
