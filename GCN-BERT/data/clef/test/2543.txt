Step 2: 2-methyl-N-(1-(3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)ethylidene)propane-2-sulfinamide
To a mixture of the raw materials 1-(3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)ethanone (500 mg, 2.02 mmol), tert-butylsulfinamide (270 mg, 2.22 mmol) and tetraethyl titanate (911 mg, 4.00 mmol) was added tetrahydrofuran (100 mL). The resulting mixture was heated for 12 hours at reflux, then cooled to room temperature, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to afford 2-methyl-N-(1-(3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)ethylidene)propane-2-sulfinamide (300 mg, yield 42.3%)
