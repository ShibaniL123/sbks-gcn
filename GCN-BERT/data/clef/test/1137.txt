TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a novel nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocyclyl compound or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof useful as a pharmaceutical agent, a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same as an active ingredient; or a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of a disease, which comprises administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of such compound or salt thereof to a warm-blooded animal; and the like. BACKGROUND ART Lipolysis in adipocytes has been known to cause an increase in the level of triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and the like (for example, see Non-Patent Literature 1). Such abnormality in blood lipid levels causes hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and the like. Accordingly, suppression of lipolysis in adipocytes is useful for regulation of blood lipid levels, such as (i) an increase in the level of high density lipoprotein (HDL), or (ii) a decrease in the level of total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), or triglyceride (TG). It is anticipated that a compound having lipolysis-suppressive activity will be useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of dyslipidemia with low HDL cholesterol, hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia with high LDL cholesterol, dyslipidemia with high VLDL cholesterol, dyslipidemia with high triglyceride (hypertriglyceridemia), hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, lipid metabolism abnormality, arteriosclerosis, type I diabetes mellitus, type II diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, apoplectic stroke, adiposity, angina, chronic renal failure, peripheral vascular disorder, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, anorexia nervosa, metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the like, or for reduction in event occurrence or mortality due to cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease (for example, see Example E of Patent Literature 7, or Example 4 of Patent Literature 8). There is known an anthranilic acid derivative having regulating action on blood lipids level (for example, see Patent Literatures 1 to 7). However, the compound of the present invention differs from the above-described anthranilic acid derivative in terms of the structure of a heterocyclyl ring to which an amide group is bound.

Test Example 1 Adipocyte Lipolysis Assay The suppressive or promoting activity of a test compound on the lipolysis of neutral fat can be assayed according to an adipocyte lipolysis assay as a cell line assay. If a beta adrenoceptor is stimulated with isoproterenol or the like in adipocytes, lipolysis action in which neutral fat accumulated in the cells is decomposed into fatty acid and glycerol can be promoted, and as a result, the amount of such fatty acid or glycerol released out of the cells can be increased. When a test compound that suppresses lipolysis is added to adipocytes, lipolysis-promoting action by isoproterenol stimulation is reduced, and the concentration of fatty acid or glycerol in a medium is decreased. Accordingly, the suppressive activity of a test compound on lipolysis can be assayed by measuring the reduction percentage of the fatty acid concentration or glycerol concentration in a culture supernatant. Likewise, the promoting activity of a test compound on lipolysis can be assayed by measuring the increase percentage of the fatty acid concentration or glycerol concentration in a medium. [1] Substances Used (1) Human subcutaneous adipocytes disseminated onto a 96 well (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.: F-SA-1096) (2) Adipocyte Maintenance Medium (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.: AM 1) (3) Lipolysis assay buffer [137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 4.2 mM NaHCO3, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM KH2PO4, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 5 mM Glucose, 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 1% BSA, 1 μM Isoproterenol] (4) NEFA-C Test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) [2] Preparation of Screening Materials 1 μL each of a test compound prepared with DMSO was added to a lipolysis assay buffer that had previously been heated to 37° C., so that it resulted in a concentration of 100 mM, 10 mM, 1 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.01 mM, or 0 mM. In this operation, the actual concentration of the test compound in the buffer was 1/1000 of the above-described concentration. The above-described subcutaneous adipocytes were cultured in 200 μL of an Adipocyte Maintenance Medium in each well for 7 days. During this culturing operation, the medium was exchanged with a fresh one every 3 days. The medium was exchanged by discarding 100 μL of the medium in each well and then adding 100 μL of a fresh Adipocyte Maintenance Medium to the well. Thereafter, the adipocytes were washed with a Lipolysis assay buffer. Subsequently, 50 μL of a Lipolysis assay buffer that contained the above-described test compound was added to each well, and it was then incubated for 5 hours. In order to obtain the measurement value of the test compound in each concentration, 5 wells on a 96-well plate were used with respect to each concentration. As a positive control of a compound having lipolysis suppressive activity, nicotinic acid was used with reference to a previous report [Green A et. al., J. Biol. Chem., 1992, 267(5), 3223-9]. [3] Measurement Procedures 40 μL of a culture supernatant was extracted from each well, and the fatty acid concentration in the supernatant was then measured. Such fatty acid concentration was measured as follows, using the above-described NEFA-C Test Wako. 80 μL of liquid A included in the kit was added to 40 μL of the culture supernatant extracted from each well, and the obtained mixture was then incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. Thereafter, 160 μL of liquid B was added, and the obtained mixture was further incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. Thereafter, the absorbance at a wavelength of 550 nM was measured. At the same time, a standard fatty acid solution included in the kit was diluted to prepare a dilution series having a volume of 40 μL. According to the same operations as described above, liquid A and liquid B were added, and the absorbance was then measured. In accordance with instructions included with the kit, a calibration curve was prepared. Based on the thus prepared calibration curve, the fatty acid concentration in the culture supernatant was calculated. The reduction percentage of the fatty acid concentration was calculated with the following formula, setting the reduction percentage obtained by addition of 100 μM (final concentration) of nicotinic acid at 100%. [in-line-formulae]Fatty acid concentration reduction percentage(%)=[(Fatty acid concentration of test compound addition group−fatty acid concentration of nicotinic acid addition group)/(fatty acid concentration of control group−fatty acid concentration of nicotinic acid addition group)]×100[/in-line-formulae] The obtained fatty acid concentration reduction percentage was fitted to a four-parameter logistic model (referring to XLfit 4.1: CTC Laboratories Systems) as shown in the following formula. Based on the obtained fitting formula, an IC50 value was calculated as a test compound concentration that gives 50% of fatty acid concentration reduction percentage.
