This application claims priority to European application No. 12190802.4 filed on Oct. 31, 2012, the whole content of this application being incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention pertains to a process for manufacturing fluoropolymer hybrid composites and to uses thereof for several applications. BACKGROUND ART Organic-inorganic polymer hybrids, wherein inorganic solids on a nano or molecular level are dispersed in organic polymers, have raised a great deal of scientific, technological and industrial interests because of their unique properties. To elaborate organic-inorganic polymer hybrid composites, a sol-gel process using metal alkoxides is the most useful and important approach. By properly controlling the reaction conditions of hydrolysis and polycondensation of metal alkoxydes, in particular of alkoxysilanes (e.g. tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) or tetraethoxysilane (TEOS)), in the presence of pre-formed organic polymers, it is possible to obtain hybrids with improved properties compared to the original compounds. The polymer can enhance the toughness and processability of otherwise brittle inorganic materials, wherein the inorganic network can enhance scratch resistance, mechanical properties and surface characteristics of said hybrids. Hybrids made from sol-gel technique starting from fluoropolymers, in particular from vinylidene fluoride polymers are known in the art. For instance, WO 2011/121078 (SOLVAY SOLEXIS S.P.A.) Jun. 10, 2011 discloses a process for the manufacture of fluoropolymer hybrid organic-inorganic composites wherein at least a fraction of hydroxyl groups of a fluoropolymer are reacted in solution or in molten state with at least a fraction of hydrolysable groups of a metal compound of formula X4-mAYm (X is a hydrocarbon group, Y is a hydrolysable group, A is a metal selected from Si, Ti and Zr, m is an integer from 1 to 4). The hydrolysis and/or polycondensation of said metal compound or of pendant —Ym-1AX4-m groups can be carried out simultaneously to the step of reacting the hydroxyl groups of the fluoropolymer and the metal compound or can be carried out once said reaction has occurred. In case of reaction between said fluoropolymer and said metal compound in the molten state, the hydrolysis and/or polycondensation is preferably promoted by injection of water vapour, optionally in combination with a volatile acid catalyst.

The reactor was vented and pressurized with nitrogen to 1 bar, then 21.6 g of HEA monomer and 871 g of diethyl carbonate were introduced into the reactor, followed by 187 g of a 75% by weight solution of t-amyl perpivalate initiator in isododecane and 29043 g of VDF monomer. The reactor was then gradually heated to 57° C. to a final pressure of 110 bar. Temperature was maintained constant at 57° C. throughout the whole trial. Pressure was maintained constant at 110 bar throughout the whole trial by feeding a 2.5 g/l aqueous solution of HEA monomer to a total of 21.7 lt. After 182 minutes, the polymerization run was stopped by degassing the suspension until reaching atmospheric pressure. The polymer so obtained was then recovered, washed with demineralised water and oven-dried at 50° C. The VDF-HEA copolymer so obtained (21 Kg) contained 0.2% by moles of HEA, as determined by NMR, and had a melt flow index of 7.5 g/10 min (230° C., 2.16 Kg). Reactive Extrusion—General Procedure The process of the invention is carried out in a twin screw co-rotating intermeshing extruder (Leistritz 18 ZSE 18 HP having a screw diameter D of 18 mm and a screw length of 720 mm (40 D)). The extruder is equipped with a main feeder and two degassing units. The barrel is composed of eight temperature controlled zones and a cooled one (at the feeder) that allow to set the desired temperature profile. The molten polymer exits from a die, composed of two holes having each a diameter of 3 mm. The two extrudates are cooled in a water tank. Subsequently, the material is at the same time pulled by a pull roller and dried by compressed air just before being cut-off in pellets by the machine. The screw is composed of a region of conveying elements with a regular decrease of pitch (from zone 0 to 2), then a degassing unit for the developed gases and two other conveying elements (from zone 3 to 4); after this series of elements, six kneading blocks alternated with two conveying elements are located (from zone 4 to 6). Finally, four conveying elements with a second degassing unit are situated before the die exit. The temperature profile used is reported in Table 1 here below. The extruder speed was 200 rpm.

The SiO2 content was determined by using the following equation (1): [in-line-formulae]SiO2[%]=[[SiO2]/([SiO2]+[F])]×100 (1)[/in-line-formulae] wherein [SiO2] and [F] from equation (1) are calculated using the following equations (2) and (3), respectively: [in-line-formulae][SiO2]=([SiEDS]×60)/28 (2)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae][F]=([FEDS]×64)/38 (3)[/in-line-formulae] wherein: SiEDS and FEDS are the weight % of Si and F obtained by EDS,60 is the molecular weight of SiO2,28 is the atomic weight of Si,64 is the molecular weight of CH2═CF2, and38 is the atomic weight of two F elements. EXAMPLE 1 Manufacture of VDF-HEA/Silica Hybrid Composite (i) Manufacture of the Pre-Gelled Metal Compound In a 500 ml beaker equipped with a magnetic stirrer running at a moderated speed were introduced in sequence 200 g of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), 69.45 g of water (TEOS:H2O molar ratio=4:1), 50 g of ethanol (TEOS:EtOH weight ratio=4:1) and 2.69 g of citric acid (1% by weight based on the total weight of TEOS and water), and left under stirring for three hours at room temperature. (ii) Reactive Extrusion The extrusion conditions according to the general procedure as detailed hereinabove were followed. The pre-gelled metal compound aqueous solution obtained under step (i) of Example 1 was fed using a peristaltic pump in the main feeder of the twin-screw extruder. The VDF-HEA (0.2% by moles) copolymer [polymer (F-B)] was added thereto at a feed rate of 528 g/h while the pre-gelled metal compound aqueous solution was fed at a feed rate of 472 g/h. The pre-gelled metal compound aqueous solution was maintained under vigorous stirring during all the process. The amount of SiO2 in the fluoropolymer hybrid organic/inorganic composite pellets so obtained was 14.5% by weight. The theoretical amount of SiO2, calculated assuming complete TEOS hydrolysis and/or polycondensation, would be 20% by weight of the fluoropolymer hybrid organic/inorganic composite pellets. EXAMPLE 2 Manufacture of VDF-HEA/Silica Hybrid Composite The same procedure as detailed under Example 1 was followed but using a blend of SOLEF® 6008 PVDF homopolymer and the VDF/HEA (1.1% by moles) copolymer [polymer (F-A)] in a weight ratio of 80:20. The amount of SiO2 in the fluoropolymer hybrid organic/inorganic composite pellets so obtained was 8.8% by weight. The theoretical amount of SiO2, calculated assuming complete TEOS hydrolysis and/or polycondensation, would be 20% by weight of the fluoropolymer hybrid organic/inorganic composite pellets. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 Manufacture of VDF-HEA/Silica Hybrid Composite The VDF-HEA (0.2% by moles) copolymer [polymer (F-B)] and citric acid in an amount of 0.5% by weight of said polymer (F-B) were fed in the main feeder of the twin-screw extruder at a feed rate of 528 g/h. An aqueous medium containing 200 g of TEOS, 69.45 g of water and 50 g of ethanol was then fed using a peristaltic pump to the main feeder of the twin-screw extruder at a speed rate of 472 g/h. The same extrusion conditions as those reported under Example 1 were used. The amount of SiO2 in the fluoropolymer hybrid organic/inorganic composite pellets so obtained was 2.3% by weight. The theoretical amount of SiO2, calculated assuming complete TEOS hydrolysis and/or polycondensation, would be 20% by weight of the fluoropolymer hybrid organic/inorganic composite pellets. It has been thus shown that by the process of the invention fluoropolymer hybrid organic/inorganic composites are obtained that advantageously comprise enhanced amounts of inorganic domains as compared with composites obtained by the processes known in the art. EXAMPLE 3 Manufacture of a Film The pellets obtained from the process as detailed under Example 1 were processed by compression moulding at 230° C. in a press obtaining a 300 μm film with an elastic modulus of 1982 MPa. EXAMPLE 4 Manufacture of a Film The pellets obtained from the process as detailed under Example 2 were extruded in a Brabender single screw extruder having a diameter of 19 mm and a length to diameter ratio of 25. This extruder was equipped with a flat die having an opening of 100×0.5 mm. Different temperature profiles giving a range of melt temperatures between 190° C. and 270° C. were set: the higher the temperature, the smoother the final film. By setting the calendar temperature at 70° C. with a line speed of 0.4 m/min and a screw rotation speed of 20 rpm, a 500 μm film of good quality was obtained. 1.
