REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/979,635 filed on Apr. 15, 2014, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention generally relates to protective clothing for use with yard care power tools such as grass and weed trimmers, chainsaws, and sprayers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hand held grass and weed trimmers, using a rotating filament or a plastic rod to accomplish the trimming, are used widely in lawn maintenance. The trimmers generally are characterized by an elongated body in the form of a narrow shaft having forward and rear ends. A spool of cutting filament or a series of plastic rods generally are mounted at the forward end of the trimmer and a length of filament is unwound from the spool so as to perform the cutting action as the spool is rotated at high speeds. Although the trimmer is typically equipped with a shield at the forward end of the trimmer near the cutting filament, the shield is only marginally effective. As the trimmer operates, grass and weed clippings will reach the user, leaving the user covered in grass, weeds, and other small debris. This will leave the user dirty and oftentimes feeling sticky and uncomfortable and his clothing dirty and oftentimes stained. Depending upon the flora the user is working in, he can also get covered with residues from noxious plants such as poison ivy oil and painful briars which could leave the user in need of medical treatment. Though there are many protective coverings available to protect the user of a hand held weed and grass trimmer, they are primarily concerned with protecting the user from injury due to impact from flying debris such as stones and twigs. As such, they are not comfortable to wear nor are they purposed to keep the wearer and his clothing clean and dry. Schaub (U.S. Pat. No. 6,205,593) attempts to provide a protective covering. While providing a protective covering, the covering Schaub teaches is designed to provide a leg protector which when subjected to a repetitive impact absorbs the impact of flying debris. Schaub does not teach a protector which provides protection of the user's shoes nor does he teach a weather resistant protective covering. The protective covering taught by Schaub uses weights to keep the protective covering from bunching up on the user's legs so it is questionable whether the protective covering is truly lightweight. The protective covering taught by Schaub fits snuggly around the user's upper leg so it is questionable whether the protective covering is truly comfortable. The present invention provides an extremely light weight, breathable, adjustable, comfortable, and cleanable covering for the operator of a hand held weed and grass trimmer or sprayer. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises a protective covering for a user's leg while using a hand held grass and weed trimmer or other yard care power tool such as a chainsaw, a pressure washer, bug sprayer, power painter, and the like. The protective covering provides protection from dirt and grime to a user's leg from the lower portion of the upper leg down to the top of the user's shoes; effectively keeping the user's legs and clothing clean while using the hand held grass and weed trimmer. The protective covering comprises a readily washable and moisture resistant fabric. The fabric is notched with a V notch at the upper end which allows for easily pulling the protective covering over the user's pants and shoes. The fabric is flared at the lower end to protect the user's shoes. At the lower end, the fabric also arcs upwards towards the back of the user's shoes which improves the durability of the protective covering by reducing the opportunity for the protective covering to slip below the user's shoe while protecting the user's shoes. The protective cover is held in place on the user's leg by a combination of hook and loop fastener (such as VELCRO) and elastic strip attached at the protective cover's upper end; this combination of hook and loop fastener and elastic strip allows the protective cover to be attached above the user's knee and to fit comfortably and snuggly as the user moves about with the grass and weed trimmer. Preferably, the protective cover comprises a substantially conical, nonwoven polypropylene fabric. Due to the simplicity of the protective cover, it can be manufactured economically. The invention, and its objects and advantages, will become more apparent in the detailed description of the preferred embodiment presented below.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Various embodiments of the present invention provide a protective covering for the leg of a person operating a hand held grass/weed trimmer or similar power tools and sprayers. Referring to FIG. 1, a person wearing a preferred embodiment of a protective covering 100 of the present invention is depicted. The protective covering 100 comprises a lightweight, flexible, breathable, water resistant fabric formed into a substantially conical body 110. In the preferred embodiment, the lightweight, flexible, breathable fabric is comprised of 100 percent polypropylene. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polypropylene comprises a nonwoven polypropylene which has a fabric weight of between about 60 grams per square meter and about 120 grams per square meter. The polypropylene more preferably comprises a nonwoven polypropylene which has a fabric weight of about 80 grams per square meter. The protective covering 100 may also be comprised of a polypropylene polyethylene fabric, a polypropylene polybutylene fabric and the like. Referring to FIG. 2, a side view of a preferred embodiment of the protective covering 100 is depicted. The substantially conical body 110 possesses a height 140 and an upper end 120 and a lower end 130. The upper end 120 is narrower than the lower end 130. In one preferred embodiment, a diameter d1 of the upper end 120 is preferably between about 6 inches and 8 inches, and more preferably about 8 inches. A diameter d2 of the lower end 130 is preferably between about 8 inches and 12 inches and more preferably about 10 inches. The height 140 of the substantially conical body 110 will preferably be between about 22 inches and 26 inches and more preferably about 24 inches for use by a male wearer with a height of between about 5 feet 10 inches and about 6 feet 4 inches. The height 140 of the substantially conical body 110 will preferably be between about 20 inches and 24 inches and more preferably about 21 inches for use by a male wearer with a height of between about 5 feet 2 inches and about 5 feet 10 inches. For users with heights outside these ranges, the dimensions of the substantially conical body 110 will be proportionally adjusted to fit the user. The substantially conical body 110 is preferably formed via a rearward hem 150 along the back of the protective covering 100. Referring to FIG. 3, a rearward view of a preferred embodiment of the protective covering 100 is depicted. The rearward hem 150 of the substantially conical body 110 runs from the lower end 130 to a hem endpoint 160 below the upper end 120. The distance from the hem endpoint 160 and the upper end 120 is preferably about 12 inches to about 16 inches, and is more preferably about 14 inches when designed for use by a person with a height of about 5 feet 10 inches to about 6 feet. For users with heights outside these ranges, the dimensions of the substantially conical body 110 will be proportionally adjusted to fit the user. The substantially conical body 110 is preferably formed via a rearward hem 150 along the back of the protective covering 100. This will allow for the protective covering 100 to have a “V” notch opening 152 when the user pulls the protective covering 100 on or off. The V notch opening 152 allows for ease in pulling the protective covering 100 over the user's shoe. A rivet 162 is installed approximate to the hem endpoint 160 to provide additional support to the stress point of the rearward hem 150. The rivet 162 makes sure the rearward hem 150 is not ripped off, in situations such as, for e.g., when the user accidently steps on and pushes the V notch opening 152 etc. Referring again to FIG. 3, there is a tab 170 possessing a lead end 174 and a tail end 176 extending from the upper end 120. The tab 170 is preferably about three to twelve inches long and about 1.5 inches wide. The tab 170 is more preferably about 4.5 inches long. In the preferred embodiment, the tab widens to about 3 inches wide along a length of the V notch opening 152. This widening of the tab 170 as it approaches the substantially conical body 110 provides strength to the tab 170 and reduces the possibility of the tab 170 from ripping away from the substantially conical body 110. Referring again to FIG. 3, affixed to the upper end 120 is an elastic strip 210 and a hook and loop fastener 220. The elastic strip 210 is preferably affixed to the upper end 120 near the tail end 176 of the tab 170. The length of the elastic strip 210 is preferably about six inches to thirteen inches in length and more preferably about ten inches in length. The hook and loop fastener 220 is comprised of a hook pad 224 and a loop pad 226. The loop pad 226 is preferentially attached substantially to the length of the tab 170. The hook pad 224 is preferably affixed to the upper end 120 near the elastic strip 210. The hook pad 224 is preferably about four inches to about six inches in length. The hook and loop fastener 220 allows for the protective covering 100 to fit comfortably to the user's leg. The elastic strip 210 allows for the protective covering 100 to fit snuggly to the user's leg and remain secured as the user moves and the leg changes diameter as the user's muscles contract and expand. The loop pad 224 is preferably attached to the tab 170 to keep the tab 170 from picking up loose debris when the protective covering 100 is not in use. The tab 170 covers portions of the V notch opening 152 when the hook and loop fastener 220 is in fastened position yet designed to leave a slight opening for airflow and breathability. The elastic strip 210 and hook and loop fastener 220 are preferably attached to the upper end 120 via sewing. Other readily available means to attach the elastic strip 210 and hook and loop fastener 220 such as gluing or riveting may also be used. Other readily available means to attach the protective covering to the user's leg such as using a series of buttons and button eyelets, clip fasteners, tie strings, magnets, etc. may also be used. Thus, in somewhat general terms, the protective covering includes a first fastening element attached to the upper end 120 on a first side of the V-shaped notch 152, and a second fastening element attached to the upper end 120 on a second side of the V -shaped notch 152. The first and second fastening elements cooperatively work together to allow a user to easily open the V -shaped notch, slide his or her foot through the protective covering so the protective covering covers his or her leg, then engage the first and second fastening elements to close the V-shaped notch. Thus, the second fastening element is configured to detachably engage the first fastening element to selectively set a diametric opening size for the upper end 120 of the substantially conical body 110. In the preferred embodiment, the protective covering 100 comprises a continuous sheet of fabric extending from the upper end 120 to the lower end 130 that includes only hems to provide the desired shape. The protective covering 100 does not include any weights or structural ribs, and that allows it to be a light weight, breathable, and comfortable covering. Further, this simplicity of the protective covering 100, also allows it to be manufactured economically. Referring again to FIG. 2, it is readily apparent that the lower end 130 follows a gently sloping arc 135. The gently sloping arc 135 allows for the protective covering 100 to rest above the user's shoes and improves the durability of the protective covering by reducing the opportunity for the protective covering to slip below the user's shoe while still providing protection from debris to the user's shoes. The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention. 1.
