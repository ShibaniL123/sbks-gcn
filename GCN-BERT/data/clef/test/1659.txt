Process for the preparation of polymers containing amino groups employing a heterogeneous iron catalyst. Field of the invention The present invention is related to a process for the preparation of polymers containing amino groups by hydrogenation of nitrile groups containing polymers by heterogeneous catalysis, a catalyst suitable to carry out said process and the use of said catalyst for carrying out said reaction. Background of the invention The hydrogenation of all or a part of the nitrile groups to amino groups allows the further chemical modification of the polymers and thus to adjust their properties in a very wide range. Two typical techniques are known for hydrogenation of polymers that are based on homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Although homogeneous hydrogenation provides high conversions, it sometimes causes chain scission and often leads to polymer contamination with the metal due to catalyst extraction difficulties. On the other hand, heterogeneous hydrogenation often yields moderate conversions but is sometimes preferable to homogeneous hydrogenation due to reduced chain scission, no contamination of the polymer, and the ease of catalyst extraction, separation and regeneration. Furthermore, supported heterogeneous transition and noble metal catalysts are recyclable and produce less byproducts than homogeneous extraction products. Although the hydrogenation of nitriles to produce the corresponding amines has been studied extensively in the low molecular weight range, inter alia it is described in Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Hydrogenation of Nitriles into a liquid phase: Chemical, Catalytic and Mechanistic Aspects. C. de Bellefon, P. Fouilloux, Catal. Rev. Sci. Eng. (1994) 36 (3), 459-506 there are no indications on the transferability of said method to the hydrogenation of nitrile-containing polymers in general and on nitrile rubber in particular. The hydrogenation of nitrile groups of high molecular weight compounds is much less investigated. According to the Journal of Applied Polymer Science (2001 ) 79, 1618-1626 the hydrogenation of nitrile groups of nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) leads to an increase in the molar mass and gelling of the polymer In US 2456428 the hydrogenation of polymeric nitriles with at least 4 units was described with any of known hydrogenation catalysts (metallic nickel, colloidal platinum, finely dispersed palladium, copper chromite, oxides or sulfides of Cr, W or Mo; preferably Raney-Nickel). As an example a nitrile-styrene rubber was hydrogenated using a Raney Ni catalyst in benzene with addition of ammonia. But no information was given about the molecular weight before and after the hydrogenation and no quantitative analysis of the conversion of nitrile groups to amino groups was done. The hydrogenation of the butadiene-acrylonitrile co-polymer with molecular weights up to 100.000 by a two stage process wherein first, the C=C groups are hydrogenated on Pd/C and in the following step the CN fragments are hydrogenated on Ni Raney catalyst is disclosed in US 2,585,583. However, the drastic conditions of 250 °C and 930-950 atm do not allow commercial use of this method. Furthermore, US 2585 583 described that polymers with a higher molecular weight than 100000 cannot be hydrogenated in a clear fashion. In US 6,121 ,188, the hydrogenation of the nitrile groups of nitrile rubber was effected in the presence Co Raney with a particular mesoporous structure. In this case a 15% solution of nitrile rubber having a molecular weight of 3000 was hydrogenated in THF. It is further stated that by said method, the reduction of nitrile groups occurs first and the C=C double bond is hydrogenated thereafter. US 8,119,556 and US 7,767,859 disclose methods for producing a low-molecular primary amine by hydrogenation of the corresponding nitrile in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. The hydrogenation catalyst contains at least one metal selected from the group consisting of nickel, cobalt and iron and has to be pretreated with at least one agent selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers, esters and carbon monoxide at 150 to 500°C before its use in the hydrogenation of nitrile. However, iron- containing catalysts are not preferred and no examples thereof are actually shown. The use of Raney nickel doped with iron chromium, and zinc as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of low-molecular dinitrile compounds is disclosed in US 2011230681. JP2002201163 and JP2002205975 describe the continuous hydrogenation of low- molecular nitriles to their corresponding primary amines in a liquid phase over a suspended, activated Raney catalyst based on an alloy of aluminum and at least one transition metal selected from the group consisting of iron, cobalt and nickel, and, if desired, one or more further transition metals selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, chromium and manganese. The hydrogenation is carried out in the absence of ammonia and basic alkali metal compounds or alkaline earth metal compounds. Hitherto, data on hydrogenation of polymers containing amino groups by heterogeneous catalysis in general is scarce and available data either is limited to the hydrogenation of low-molecular polymers or to the use of mainly noble metals, Co Raney or Ni Raney catalysts. In particular, no actual example of a successful hydrogenation of nitrile side groups of polymers with high molecular weights Mw (weights higher than 200,000) on a heterogeneous catalyst in general and a supported Fe(0) catalyst in particular, has been disclosed. Summary of the invention The present invention is related to a process for the preparation of polymers containing amino groups via hydrogenation of nitrile groups containing polymers wherein the nitrile groups containing polymers are contacted with hydrogen in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst containing iron in the oxidation state 0 (Fe°). The present invention allows a good control of the degree of hydrogenation of C≡N bonds in particular for copolymers having a saturated main chain such as hydrogenated nitrile rubber or for copolymers or having residual double bonds in the range from 0.5 to 20 mol- % based on repeating units derived from diene monomers. The present invention further provides a process for the hydrogenation of nitrile groups in polymers such that the molecular weight of the rubber remains unchanged after the hydrogenation of the nitrile groups into amino groups. The present invention furthermore provides a process for the hydrogenation of nitrile groups of polymers to amino groups which avoids the destruction of the polymer chain during the hydrogenation and wwhich leads to marginal gel formation. Using iron catalysts the reaction can even be carried out in halogenated solvents like monochlorobenzene without dehydrohalogenation of the solvent. Detailed description of the invention.

When comonomers of this kind are employed it is possible to take the polymerization to high conversions and to obtain nitrile rubbers which have a comparatively higher average molecular weight Mw (weight average) and/or Mn (number average), and yet are gel-free. The proportions of conjugated diene and α,β-unsaturated nitrile in the NBR polymers may vary within wide ranges. The proportion of or the sum of the conjugated dienes is typically in the range from 40 to 90% preferably in the range from 50 to 85%, by weight, based on the overall polymer. The proportion of or the sum of the α,β-unsaturated nitriles is typically 10 to 60%, preferably 15 to 50%, by weight, based on the overall polymer. The proportions of the monomers add up in each case to 100% by weight. Typically, the additional monomers may, depending on their nature, be present in amounts of 0% to 40% by weight, based on the overall polymer. In this case, the corresponding proportions of the conjugated diene or dienes and/or of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile or nitriles are replaced by the proportions of the additional monomers, with the proportions of all the monomers adding up in each case to 100% by weight. If esters of (meth)acrylic acid are used as additional monomers, they are usually used in amounts of from 1 to 25% by weight. The nitrogen content of the nitrile rubbers of the invention is determined by the Kjeldahl method in accordance with DIN 53 625. Owing to the content of polar comonomers, the nitrile rubbers are usually soluble in methyl ethyl ketone to an extent of > 85% by weight at 20°C. The glass transition temperatures of the nitrile rubbers and hydrogenated nitrile rubbers of the invention are generally situated in the range from -70°C to +20°C, preferably in the -60°C to 10° range. Preference is given to nitrile rubbers according to the invention which comprise repeating units of acrylonitrile, 1 ,3-butadiene and optionally of one or more further copolymerizable monomers. Preference is likewise given to nitrile rubbers having repeating units of acrylo- nitrile, 1 ,3 butadiene and one or more esters or amides of α,β-unsaturated mono- carboxylic or dicarboxylic acids, and in particular repeating units of an alkylester of an α,β- unsaturated carboxylic acid, very particularly preferably of methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, t-butyl (meth)acrylate, hexyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, octyl (meth)acrylate or lauryl (meth)acrylate. The preparation of such nitrile rubbers is typically performed by emulsion-polymerization of the abovementioned monomers which is adequately known to those skilled in the art and is comprehensively described in the polymer literature. Nitrile rubbers which can be used for the purposes of the invention are also commercially available, e.g. as products from the product range of the trade names Perbunan® and Krynac® from Lanxess Deutschland GmbH. Hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubbers: The term hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubbers or "HNBR" for short is intended to mean all aforementioned nitrile rubbers which have been subjected to hydrogenation of a part or of all of their C=C double bonds. Preferably, the term refers to hydrogenated nitrile rubbers with a degree of hydrogenation, based on the C=C double bond originating from the conjugated diene, of at least 80, more preferably at least 90, even more preferably at least 95 and most preferably at least 98%. The degree of hydrogenation can be determined, for example, by NMR or by IR spectroscopy. For hydrogenation the nitrile rubber obtained from emulsion polymerization is converted into a solid rubber. The conversion of the nitrile rubber latex into a solid rubber is carried out by the methods known to the person skilled in the art. The nitrile rubber, from which impurities have been removed, is subsequently either dissolved in an organic solvent, if the impurities were removed from it by the purification methods known to the person skilled in the art, such as precipitation or coagulation and subsequent washing, or the retentate solution obtained by the method according to the present invention, which contains the dissolved and purified nitrile butadiene rubber, directly has a transition metal catalyst suitable for the hydrogenation added to it, and is hydrogenated. The hydrogenation of nitrile rubber is well known to a person skilled in the art from e.g. US-A-3,700,637; US-A-4,464,515 and DE A3-046.008, DE A3-227.650 and DE A3- 329,974. NBR and HNBR are also collectively referred to as (H)NBR in this application unless indicated otherwise. Catalyst The catalyst for the present process for the preparation of the polymers containing amino groups by hydrogenation of nitrile groups containing polymers contains iron in the oxidation state 0 on a support, preferably a porous and/or particulate support. As support materials, oxides such as silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, magnesium oxide and mixtures thereof, graphite, or polymers, for example copolymers of styrene and divinylbenzene can be used. The term silicon oxides extends in principle to all types of silicon dioxide and to synthetic and natural silicates, such as silicate minerals mesosilicates, borosilicates, cyclosilicates, inosilicates, phyllosilicates. Said term should also include Si02 is included in its various crystalline or amorphous forms, such as diatomaceous earth, silica, fumed silica, colloidal silica, silica gel or aerogel. Furthermore, should extend to mixed oxides, which contain, based on the weight of the mixed oxide without water of crystallization - at least 50% by weight, preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 90% by weight and most preferably at least 95 wt% silica and the balance being another oxidic material, such as MgO, CaO, T1O2, Zr02, Fe203, Al203, or alkali metal. The support material typically comprises less than 500 ppm halogen. In a preferred embodiment the carrier material comprises less than 2 wt%, preferably less than 1 wt%, more preferably less than 500 ppm of alkali metal. Typically, the support materials have a specific surface area ranging from 20 to 1000 m2/g, preferably in the range of from 80 to700 m2/g and particularly preferably in the range of 100 to 600 m2/g (BET surface area according to DIN 66131 ). If the catalyst of the invention is in a particulate form, its mean particle size determined by sieve analysis according to DIN 66165 (Method F) is typically in the range of 0.001 mm to 10 mm, preferably in the range of 0.005 mm to 1 mm and particularly preferably in the range of 0.01 mm to 0.1 mm. The catalyst of the invention can be obtained, for example, by incipient wetness impregnation with a solution or a slurry of one or more iron-containing compounds such as ammonium iron (III) oxalate trihydrate, iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate, iron (II) acetate, ammonium iron (III) citrate, iron (III) citrate, iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate, iron (II) chloride, iron (II) bromide, iron (III) bromide, ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate, iron (III) chloride, iron (II) chloride, iron (III ) chloride hexahydrate, iron (III) acetylacetonate, iron (II) oxalate dihydrate, iron (III) sulfate hydrate, iron (II) sulfate hydrate, iron (III) phosphate, iron (III) phosphate dihydrate, iron (III) oxalate hexahydrate , ammonium iron (III) sulfate or others on a support and subsequent drying. In a preferred embodiment, the supported catalyst is further impregnated with promoter(s) selected from the group consisting of alkaline and earth-alkaline compounds, in particular basic alkaline and earth-alkaline compounds such as e.g. NaOH, KOH, Na2C03, K2C03, Mg-Citrate. The impregnation can also be effected by washing the supported catalyst with an aqueous solution of the alkaline and/or earth-alkaline compounds. The content of the alkali or earth-alkali metal in the dried catalyst is preferably in the range of from 0.05 to 15wt%, preferably in the range of 0.5 to 10wt% and most preferably in the range of 1 to 5 wt% based on the weight of the catalyst. The impregnation with the promoting compound can be carried out directly after impregnation with the metal source and subsequent drying, or alternatively after calcination, prior to or after reduction of catalyst or in any order known to the person skilled in the art. Subsequently, the catalysts are calcined at temperatures above 150 ° C, preferably at temperatures of 200 to 600 ° C, particularly preferably at temperatures of 250 to 450 ° C. Then, the reduction of iron oxide with hydrogen is carried out at temperatures above 200 0 C, preferably at temperatures of preferably 350 to 450 ° C with a H2 flow of 200 to 600 ml / min, preferably from 300 to 500ml/min for 1 to 6 hours, preferably for 2 to 4 hours. It is also possible to add small amounts of a noble metal chosen from the group of Pt, Pd and Rh. In such case the amount of the noble metal (by weight) is preferably smaller than the amount of iron on the catalyst, more preferably between 1 and 50%, most preferably between 5 and 40 % of the amount of iron. In these cases, the heterogeneous catalyst typically contains Rh, Pd and/or Pt in amounts of from 0.01 to 10% by weight, preferably of from 0.5 to 7% by weight, most preferably of from 1 to 4% by weight. If the heterogeneous catalyst additionally contains Pt, Pd and/or Rh, impregnation with the noble metal can be carried out simultaneously or after the impregnation with the iron compound by contacting the support with a metal salt solution or slurry. All other steps such as drying, calcination and pre-reduction of the catalysts of the invention can be carried out analogously as described above. While the addition of said noble metals may not increase the actual yield of the reduction as such, it can provide improved long-time stability of the catalyst. The hydrogenation reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent which can dissolve the nitrile groups containing polymers at least partially or completely. Suitable solvents are, for example, halogenated organic solvents, preferably chlorinated aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents such as monochlorobenzene, dichloro- benzene, methylene chloride and chloroform, aliphatic non-cyclic and cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dibutyl ether, methyl tertbutylether, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as decaline, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, benzene and mixtures of these solvents. Tetrahydrofurane, decalin, dioxane, and mixtures thereof are preferred and monochlorobenzene is especially preferred. The choice of a solvent may be dictated by the solubility of the starting polymer which can appropriately be selected by the person skilled in the art in view of the solubility parameters. By using the inventive iron catalysts the hydrogenation can be carried out in chlorinated solvents, such as halogenated aromatic, aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic solvents, preferably in monochlorobenzene, without dehydrochlorination and also at much lower temperatures (e.g. 130 ° C) than reported for the hydrogenation of low molecular nitriles. Moreover, gel formation during the hydrogenation can be largely avoided. Furthermore, even at temperatures above 200°C, tetrahydrofurane and dioxane can be used as solvents showing no hydrogenolysis in opposite to Co Raney catalysts. In a preferred embodiment, the nitrile groups containing polymer is hydrogenated in a solvent in a concentration in the range of from 1 to 30% by weight, preferably from 4 to 20% by weight more preferably 6 to 15% by weight. The concentration of the solution may depend upon the molecular weight of the nitrile groups containing polymers that is to be hydrogenated. Polymers of higher molecular weight are generally more difficult to dissolve. The amount of the catalyst required for hydrogenation is a function of the temperature of hydrogenation and the desired degree of hydrogenation. The degree of saturation usually increases with the reaction temperature, catalyst concentration and mixing rate. Depending on the desired degree of saturation and the polymer molecular weight, these variables can be adjusted to achieve the desired reaction rate. The catalyst is preferably present in the reaction at a ratio of 0.01 to 1 .0 g, more preferably 0.1 to 0.2 g of catalyst per gram of the polymer. The hydrogenation is generally carried out under hydrogen pressure of from 0.5 MPa to 25 MPa, preferably in the range of from 1.5 MPa to 18 MPa, more preferably in the range of from 3 MPa to 15 MPa and particularly preferably in the range of from 5 MPa to 12 MPa. The reaction temperature is typically in the range of from 50°C to 250°C, preferably in the range of from 100°C to 180°C and most preferably in the range of from 120°C to 150°C. The hydrogenation can carried out in any suitable reactor, such as a fixed bed reactor, stirred reactor or spinning disc reactor. Typically, the reaction time is in the range of from 1 h to 72 h, preferably in the range of from 2h to 36 h and particularly preferably in the range of from 4h to 24 h. Preferably, the hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of ammonia or alkaline hydroxides. After the hydrogenation, the catalyst can be separated by filtration, centrifugation or by a magnetic field such as a permanent magnet or electromagnet. After the addition of antioxidants, the solvent is removed by vapor rotation and /or in a drying cabinet. Alternatively, the amino group containing HNBR can be isolated by steam stripping or precipitation with methanol or ethanol and drying afterwards. Alternatively, providing the catalyst in the metallic mesh basket with the reaction mixture circulation through the catalyst basket facilitates the hydrogenation since other devices for the separation of the supported catalyst such as a decanter, a centrifugal separator and a filter are not required at all. In a typical embodiment, contacting of completely or partially hydrogenated nitrile rubber with 12 MPa hydrogen and an iron catalyst of this invention in the presence of ammonia takes place at 130 ° C for 12 to 24h. Amino group containing polymers In a preferable embodiment, the obtained amino group containing polymers have a NH2- content of from 0.01 to 10 %, preferably of from 0.1 to 7 %, most preferably of from 1 to 5 % by weight. If the nitrile content of the polymer before reduction is known, the amino group content in the hydrogenated product polymer can be determined indirectly from the decrease of the intensity of the CN absorption band. If the nitrile content of the polymer before reduction is unknown, the amino group content in the hydrogenated product polymer can be determined by preparing a calibration chart from various samples of the same type of polymer, e.g. HNBR, with different acrylonitrile content in order to determine the acrylonitrile content. In addition, the total nitrogen content is determined by elemental analysis to calculate the acrylonitrile content before hydrogenation. This acrylonitrile content should give a specific absorbance according to the calibration curve. From a lower absorbance, one can easily calculate the amino content of the hydrogenated polymer. Typically, the obtained amino group containing polymers have a gel content of not more than 4 %, more preferably not more than 2 % and most preferably of less than 1 % by weight. The gel content is determined according to ASTM D 3616 by dissolving the amino group containing polymer in of methyl ethyl ketone at 25 °C while stirring, followed by separating the non-soluble content. The separated solid content is then dried, its weight is determined and the gel content is calculated. A particularly preferred embodiment concerns amino-group containing HNB possessing the amino- and/or gel content as define above. Preferably, the nitrile-group containing polymer has an acrylonitrile content of from 18 to 50 % by weight. The amount of remaining double bonds of e.g. HNBR can be determined by the IR- spectroscopic method described in Kautschuk + Gummi. Kunststoffe, Vol. 42 (1989), No. 2, pages 107-1 10 and Kautschuk + Gummi. Kunststoffe, Vol. 42 (1989), No.3, pages 194- 197. Examples I. Used materials The introduction of amino groups by partial hydrogenation of nitrile groups was done with Therban® 3406 of the Lanxess Deutschland GmbH. Therban® 3406 has the following characteristic properties: Content of acrylonitrile: 34 wt % Mooney viscosity (ML1 +4/100°C): 63 MU Residual double bond content: 0.8 Mol% Mn: 91.3 kg/mol Mw: 297 kg/mol PDI (Mw/Mn): 3.3 Hydrogenation in THF-dioxane II. a General method for catalyst preparation: A 7.6% Fe° supported catalyst was prepared by impregnating granular Si02 (silica gel) having a specific surface area of 350m2/g and an average pore size of 12 nm with an aqueous solution of ammonium iron(lll) oxalate trihydrate. In a typical preparation, 10 g of the dried support was impregnated until incipient wetness with 5 ml of the aqueous solution containing 0.55 g of (NH4)3Fe(C204)3 3 H20. After impregnation the sample was dried at 60 °C for 12 hours and then calcined at 240 °C for 3 hours. The reduction of metal oxides on the catalyst particles was carried out in a U-shaped reactor heated at a rate of 3°C/min to 420 °C and a hydrogen flow of 100 mL/min. The temperature of 420 °C was held for 3 hours then the reactor cooled down to room temperature while maintaining the hydrogen flow. Under inert conditions, toluene was added and the catalyst particles transferred into a glass vial to prevent oxidation. The iron loading in the sample prepared was 7.6 wt%. II. b Preparation of noble metal containing iron catalyst Noble metal containing iron catalyst particles were prepared in a two-step impregnation process by initially impregnating the granular Si02 with an aqueous solution of ammonium trioxalatoferrate trihydrate followed by impregnation with an aqueous solution of optionally tetraaminopalladium chloride monohydrate, tetraaminoplatinum chloride monohydrate or rhodium trichloride trihydrate, respectively before drying, reduction and work-up as described above. II. c Hydrogenation in THF-dioxane 2.5 g of HNBR (Therban 3406) was dissolved in 45 g of THF-dioxane (1 :1 ) mixture at 50°C under vigorous stirring. The prepared solution was loaded in the autoclave (the HNBR concentration, 5% mass) 2.5 g of the catalyst (typical particle size 0.05-0.1 mm) was transferred under argon into an autoclave which previously has been purged twice with argon and hydrogen. The autoclave was filled with 0.8 MPa ammonia and the initial H2 pressure in the autoclave was 5 MPa. After heating to 220°C, the pressure in the autoclave increased to about 10 MPa. The duration was typically 8h but could be varied from 5 h to 200 h. Stirring was effected by a screw. After the reaction the catalyst was filtered off or removed by a strong magnet and the solution of the polymer was allowed to stay under the IR lamp to remove the solvent. No hydrogenolysis of the THF:dioxane mixture was observed by chromatographic analysis. The results of the hydrogenation of HNBR (5% solution in THF/Dioxane, 1 :1 ) with different catalysts at 220°C for 24 h are presented in Table 1 . Co Raney catalyst was tested under the same conditions as a reference example. Table 1 : * <1 % (<0.01 g per 1 g of the polymer) as determined by optical measurement. Although the mixed noble metal and iron catalysts led to a lower CN-group conversion than the catalyst containing only iron, they still achieved a significant higher conversion than the Co-Raney catalysts and can be expected to provide better long-term performance than the catalyst containing only iron.
