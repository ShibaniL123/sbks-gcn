BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Abnormal cell proliferation can be triggered by various causes, including but not limited to, UV-radiation and cancer therapy. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, or EGFR (also referred to as ErbB1 and HER1), is a cell surface protein, which is activated by binding of its specific ligands, such as epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor α (TGFα), etc. The activation of EGFR causes cell proliferation, inhibition of cell death, and increased epidermal hyperplasia, i.e., the increase in number and size of normal cells in normal arrangement. When skin is stimulated by UV radiation, EGFR increases keratinocyte proliferation, suppresses apoptosis, and augments and accelerates epidermal hyperplasia. (T. B. El-Abaseri and L. A. Hansen, “EGFR Activation and Ultraviolet Light Induced Skin Carcinogenesis,” Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, vol. 2007, Article ID 97939, 4 pages, 2007). When stimulated by UV radiation, keratinocyte is activated through an EGFR dependent process and begins to create an abundance of keratinocyte cells. When the skin is exposed to UV-irradiation, apoptosis is suppressed by the EGFR-dependent pathway, causing cells to live longer than usual and also to carry genetic mutations that may lead to disease formation. The suppression of apoptosis, along with keratinocyte proliferation, considerably increases skin thickness and risks of other cell proliferation disorders or conditions. Epidermal hyperplasia can be partially attributed to an injury in the basal layer keratinocytes of the cell. Shortly after skin is exposed to UV radiation the keratinocytes begin to divide and multiply at more rapid pace. The EGFR-dependent process can trigger the increase in cell production in any type of cells, from regular cells, cells suffering from epidermal hyperplasia, to the increased production of cancer cells. Pharmacological inhibition of the UV-induced activation of EGFR in genetically initiated mouse skin tumorigenesis model suppresses tumorignesis and the activation of mitrogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways. (T. B. El-Abaseri and L. A. Hansen, 2007, supra). When a subject is treated with certain cancer therapies, especially certain chemotherapy drugs, the therapies may affect the growth of skin cells or capillaries (small blood vessels) in the hands and feet, which may result in hand and foot syndrome (HFS) characterized by dysesthasia and erythema on the hands and feet several days after treatment. In some extreme cases, these symptoms may evolve into blistering desquamation, crusting, ulceration, and epidermal necrosis. Biopsies show marked hyperkeratosis with parakeratosis in the stratum corneum of the epidermis, spongiosis with numerous pyknotic cells without associated lymphocytes in the stratum malpighii, focal areas of vacuolization in the basal layer, and a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and melanin deposition in the dermis. (D. Lorusso et al., Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin-related palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (‘hand-foot’ syndrome). Ann Oncol (2007) doi: 10.1093/annonc/md1477). However, underlying causes for HFS are largely unknown. The α adrenoceptor agonists have been used therapeutically for a number of conditions including hypertension, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, spasticity, glaucoma, diarrhea, and for the suppression of opiate withdrawal symptoms (J. P. Heible and R. R. Ruffolo Therapeutic Applications of Agents Interacting with α-Adrenoceptors, p.180-206 in Progress in Basic and Clinical Pharmacology Vol. 8, P. Lomax and E. S. Vesell Ed., Karger, 1991). Published US Patent Application US20050276830 discloses α2 adrenergic receptor agonists and their use for treating or preventing inflammatory skin disorders. There is a need of methods and compositions that would effectively treat or inhibit the progression of cell proliferation disorder associated with various maladies. The present invention relates to such improved methods and compositions. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Treatment with an α adrenergic receptor agonist, such as brimonidine, has resulted in a significant reduction of cell proliferation disorder in mammals, such as mice exposed to UV radiation.

Another general aspect of the present invention relates to a method of regulating an EGFR response in a subject to thereby result in treating or preventing of a disease or condition associated with EGFR in a subject, comprising administering to the subject in need thereof a composition comprising an effective amount of an α adrenergic receptor agonist and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, a “disease or condition associated with EGFR” can be any disease or condition that can be treated by regulating the activity of EGFR. Preferably, a “disease or condition associated with EGFR” is not associated with a skin tumor, which includes a skin cancer, a benign skin tumor and pre-malignant skin tumor, nor is the “disease or condition associated with EGFR” associated with rosacea, erythema, telangiectasias psoriasis, purpura, sagging skin or wrinkle. Examples of “disease or condition associated with EGFR” include non-skin tumors, such as tumors of the oral cavity, head and neck tissues, esophagus, including local and metastatic tumors located in these tissues; and other cell proliferative disorders, such as cell proliferation disorder. The term “disease or condition associated with EGFR” also encompasses hyperplasia, increased proliferation, and pre-neoplasic lesion. According to the present invention, in a method of regulating an EGFR response in a subject, the α adrenergic receptor agonist can be administered to the subject through any route of administration, including, but not limited to topical, epicutaneous, transdermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular deliveries. In a preferred embodiment, the α adrenergic receptor agonist is delivered to a skin area subject to UV-irradiation or chemotherapy-induced damages by topical application on the skin. One embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of regulating EGFR driven epithelial pathologies related to increased proliferation in a subject, which comprises topically administering to the subject a composition comprising an effective amount of an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “regulate” or “regulating” refers to achieving a controlled response after application of the composition. As used herein, “EGFR” refers to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, the cell-surface receptor for members of the epidermal growth factor family. EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptors of which there are four: EGFR, also referred to as ErbB1 or HER1; ErbB2 or HER2/c-neu; ErbB3 or HER3; and ErbB4 or HER4. As used herein, an “effective amount of an α adrenergic receptor agonist” with respect to regulating an EGFR response in a subject, means the amount of the α adrenergic receptor agonist that is sufficient to regulate EGFR response such that a disease or condition in a subject is prevented or treated. Another general aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating hand and foot syndrome (HFS) in a subject in need thereof. The method comprises topically administering to a skin area of the subject a topical composition comprising an effective amount of at least one alpha adrenergic receptor agonist and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the skin area has, or is prone to have, hand and foot syndrome. As used herein, “hand and foot syndrome” refers to reddening, swelling, numbness or desquamation on palms of the hands, soles of the feet, knees, elbows, elsewhere, or a combination thereof in a subject that occurs in response to a biological stimulus, or as a symptom of a disease. For example, “hand and foot syndrome” can occur from the use of a chemotherapy drug, or as a symptom of sickle-cell disease. In some cases hand and foot syndrome can also be referred to as acral erythema peculiar acral erythema, chemotherapy-induced acral crythema, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia, toxic erythema of the palms and soles, and Burgdorf's reaction. In a preferred embodiment, the α adrenergic receptor agonist is delivered to a skin area susceptible to chemotherapy-induced hand and foot syndrome by topical application to the skin area. As used herein, “chemotherapy-induced hand and foot syndrome” refers to an onset of the hand and foot syndrome in a subject as a result of use of a chemotherapy drug or other targeted cancer therapy. Chemotherapy and targeted cancer therapy drugs can include, but are not limited to, cytarabine, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, capecitabine, sorafenib, sunitinib. In a method according to an embodiment of the present invention, the α adrenergic receptor agonist can be applied to the susceptible skin area prior to, after, or both prior to and after, the chemotherapy treatment. As used herein, an “effective amount of an α adrenergic receptor agonist” with respect to reducing, inhibiting, or treating hand and foot syndrome in a subject, means the amount of the α adrenergic receptor agonist that is sufficient to prevent or reduce one or more symptoms associated with hand and foot syndrome, such that the hand and foot syndrome in a subject is prevented or treated. Underlying causes of chemotherapy-induced hand and foot syndrome are unknown, however theories include temperature differences, vascular anatomies, and cell-type differences in the extremities, and are based on the fact that most or all of the symptoms are observed in the hands and feet of the subject. Merely as an observation, and without wishing to be bound by any theories, it is observed that chemotherapy-induced hand and foot syndrome is associated with one or more of the following indicators in the affected skin areas: (a) erythema and oedema; (b) accumulation of cytotoxic drugs in the skin due to a high level of vessels; (c) drug metabolite excretion by sweat glands; (d) greater activity of rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolism of pyrimidine analogues in keratinocytes; and (e) abnormalities affecting the basal keratinocytes. Another general aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) in a subject in need thereof. The method comprises topically administering to a skin area of the subject a topical composition comprising an effective amount of at least one alpha adrenergic receptor agonist and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the skin area has, or is prone to have, CTCL. As used herein, the term “cutaneous T-cell lymphomas” or “CTCL” refers to a skin condition in which there is an abnormal neoplastic proliferation of T lymphocytes. CTCLs are characterized by accumulation of malignant T cells in the skin. Early disease resembles benign skin disorders but during disease progression cutaneous tumors develop, and eventually the malignant T cells can spread to lymph nodes and internal organs. CTCL typically presents with red, scaly patches or thickened plaques of skin that often mimic eczema or chronic dermatitis. Progression from limited skin involvement is variable and can be accompanied by tumor formation, ulceration, and exfoliation, complicated by itching and infections. In a preferred embodiment, the α adrenergic receptor agonist is delivered to a skin area susceptible to CTCL by topical application to the skin area. The α adrenergic receptor agonist can be applied to the skin area alone, or in combination with another treatment for CTCL, such as a treatment with Denileukin diftitox (Ontak), an engineered protein combining interleukin-2 and Diphtheria toxin; Bexarotene (Targretin), a retinoid; Vorinostat (Zolinza), a hydroxymate histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor; or Romidepsin (Istodax), a cyclic peptide histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, etc. The therapeutic effectiveness of an α adrenergic receptor agonist against CTCLs can be evaluated using various methods known in the art. For example, xenograft animal model of tumor stage CTCL can be used. Malignant T cells derived from CTCLs, such as MyLa2059, or HUT78 cells, are subcutaneously transplanted to an immune deficient mouse, such as NOD/SCID-B2m(-/-) (NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) B2m(tm1 Unc) /J), or CB-17 SCID beige mouse. Tumor growth at the xenograft site is monitored with or without the treatment. See, e.g., Krejsgaard, et al., 2010, 19(12):1096-102; Doebbeling Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research 2010, 29:11, both are incorporated herein by reference. Any or all of the aforementioned indicators can be treated with an α adrenergic receptor agonist, such as brimonidine. Briefly, erythema and oedema have been shown to be mitigated by topical application of an α adrenergic receptor agonist, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,410,102, incorporated herein by reference. Brimonidine is a vasoconstrictor with anti-inflammatory properties (Piwnica et al., Vasoconstriction and anti-inflammatory properties of the selective α-adrenergic receptor agonist brimonidine. J Dermatol Sci. 2014 July;75(1):49-54), that can relieve the high level of vessels and the greater activity of rate-limiting enzymes in the metabolism of pyrimidine analogues. Brimonidine and other α adrenergic receptor agonists can decrease the sweat gland activity and the toxicity mediated by the metabolite excretion from the sweat glands, as sweat glands on human skin contain alpha2α adrenergic receptors (see e.g., FIG. 5). Finally, brimonidine can mitigate abnormalities affecting basal keratinocytes, as further explained in Example 6 and the results shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. One skilled in the art will recognize that the effective amount of the α adrenergic receptor agonist to be used in the instant invention can vary with factors, such as the particular subject to be treated, e.g., age, diet, health, etc., degree of UV irradiation exposed to, dosage or particular chemotherapy drug exposed to, severity and complications of the cell proliferation disorder sought to be treated or inhibited, the α adrenergic receptor agonist used, the formulation used, etc. In view of the present disclosure, standard procedures can be performed to evaluate the effect of the administration of a composition to a subject, thus allowing a skilled artisan to determine the effective amount of the α adrenergic receptor agonist to be administered to the subject. Such effect can be, for example, a clinically observable beneficial effect of the a adrenergic receptor agonist in reducing or inhibiting the progression of cell proliferation disorder in a subject, or an in vivo or in vitro measurement on the EGFR activity, etc. The clinically observable beneficial effect can be a situation that, when a composition of the present invention is administered to a subject after signs and/or symptoms, such as those related to cell proliferation disorder, are observable, the signs and/or symptoms are prevented from further development or aggravation, or develop to a lesser degree than without administration of the specified composition according to embodiments of the present invention. The clinically observable beneficial effect can also be that, when a composition of the present invention is administered to a subject before signs and/or symptoms, such as that related to cell proliferation disorder, are observable, the signs and/or symptoms are prevented from occurring or subsequently occur to a lesser degree than without administration of the composition of the present invention. Methods of the present invention can be used in conjunction with one or more other treatments or medications for preventing or inhibiting the progression of skin or epithelium thickening, or treating existing signs and/or symptoms of skin or epithelium thickening. Examples of such other treatments or medications include, but are not limited to, retinoid and its derivatives, sun-screens or sun-blocks, anti-inflammatory agents, vitamins, such as vitamin D, nitroglycerin, etc. Methods of the present invention can also be used in conjunction with one or more other treatments or medications for regulating an EGFR response in a subject, such as another anti-proliferative agent. The other medicament or treatment can be administered to the subject simultaneously with, or in a sequence and within a time interval of, the administration of the α adrenergic receptor agonist, such that the active ingredients or agents can act together to treat or prevent cell proliferation disorder and signs and/or symptoms associated therewith. For example, the other medicament or treatment and the α adrenergic receptor agonist can be administered in the same or separate formulations at the same or different times. Any suitable route of administration can be employed to deliver the additional treatment or medication including, but not limited to, oral, intraoral, rectal, parenteral, topical, epicutaneous, transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intranasal, sublingual, buccal, intradural, intraocular, intrarespiratory, or nasal inhalation. A composition according to embodiments of the present invention comprises an effective amount or a therapeutically effective amount of an α adrenergic receptor agonist and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carriers useful for topical delivery of the specified compounds according to embodiments of the invention can be any carrier known in the art for topically administering pharmaceuticals, including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable solvents, such as a polyalcohol or water; emulsions (either oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions), such as creams or lotions; micro emulsions; gels; ointments; liposomes; powders; and aqueous solutions or suspensions. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes necessary and inert pharmaceutical excipients, including, but not limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. The topical composition according to embodiments of the present invention are prepared by mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with a therapeutically effective amount of an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist according to known methods in the art, for example, methods provided by standard reference texts such as, REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY 1577-1591, 1672-1673, 866-885 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed. 19th ed. 1995); TRANSDERMAL AND TOPICAL DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS (Ghosh, T. K., et al. ed. 1997), both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the topical composition of the invention is in the form of an emulsion. Emulsions, such as creams and lotions are suitable topical formulations for use in the invention. An emulsion is a dispersed system comprising at least two immiscible phases, one phase dispersed in the other as droplets ranging in diameter from 0.1 μm to 100 μm. An emulsifying agent is typically included to improve stability. When water is the dispersed phase and an oil is the dispersion medium, the emulsion is termed a water-in-oil emulsion. When an oil is dispersed as droplets throughout the aqueous phase, the emulsion is termed an oil-in-water emulsion. Emulsions, such as creams and lotions that can be used as topical carriers and their preparation are disclosed in REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY 282-291 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed. 19th ed. 1995), hereby incorporated herein by reference. In another embodiment, the topical composition of the invention is in the form of a gel, for example, a two-phase gel or a single-phase gel. Gels are semisolid systems consisting of suspensions of small inorganic particles or large organic molecules interpenetrated by a liquid. When the gel mass comprises a network of small discrete inorganic particles, it is classified as a two-phase gel. Single-phase gels consist of organic macromolecules distributed uniformly throughout a liquid such that no apparent boundaries exist between the dispersed macromolecules and the liquid. Suitable gels for use in the invention are disclosed in REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY 1517-1518 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed. 19th ed. 1995), hereby incorporated herein by reference. Other suitable gels for use with the invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,387,383 (issued May 14, 2002); U.S. Pat. No. 6,517,847 (issued Feb. 11, 2003); and U.S. Pat. No. 6,468,989 (issued Oct. 22, 2002), each of which patents is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In an embodiment, the topical composition further comprises an aqueous gel comprising water and a water-gelling amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable gelling agent selected from the group consisting of carbomers, glycerine polyacrylate, and mixtures thereof, and the topical composition has a physiologically acceptable pH. As used herein, “carbomer” is the USP designation for various polymeric acids that are dispersible but insoluble in water. When the acid dispersion is neutralized with a base a clear, stable gel is formed. Carbomer 934P is physiologically inert and is not a primary irritant or sensitizer. Other carbomers include 910, 940, 941, and 1342. Polymer thickeners (gelling agents) that may be used in compositions according to embodiments of the present invention include those known to one skilled in the art, such as hydrophilic and hydroalcoholic gelling agents frequently used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Preferably, the hydrophilic or hydroalcoholic gelling agent comprises “CARBOPOL®” (B.F. Goodrich, Cleveland, Ohio), “HYPAN®” (Kingston Technologies, Dayton, N.J.), “NATROSOL®” (Aqualon, Wilmington, Del.), “KLUCEL®” (Aqualon, Wilmington, Del.), or “STABILEZE®” (ISP Technologies, Wayne, N.J.). Preferably the gelling agent comprises between about 0.2% to about 4% by weight of the composition. More particularly, the preferred compositional weight percent range for “CARBOPOL®” is between about 0.5% to about 2%, while the preferred weight percent range for “NATROLSOL®” and “KLUCEL®” is between about 0.5% to about 4%. The preferred compositional weight percent range for both “HYPAN®” and “STABILEZE®” is between 0.5% to about 4%. “CARBOPOL®” is one of numerous cross-linked acrylic acid polymers that are given the general adopted name carbomer. These polymers dissolve in water and form a clear or slightly hazy gel upon neutralization with a caustic material such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, triethanolamine, or other amine bases. “KLUCEL®” is a cellulose polymer that is dispersed in water and forms a uniform gel upon complete hydration. Other preferred gelling polymers include hydroxyethylcellulose, cellulose gum, MVE/MA decadiene crosspolymer, PVM/MA copolymer, or a combination thereof.

EXAMPLE 5 Photo Study with Brimonidine Albino hairless SKH1-hr mice (36/sex/group) were treated for 40 weeks with UVR and brimonidine gel or vehicle according to the design in table 11. Mice were further observed for 12 weeks without treatment. Topical treatments were performed approximately one hour before UVR on Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week and approximately one hour after UVR Tuesday and Thursday of each week. See table 11. All procedures involving animals were conducted in a fully accredited animal facility and in accordance with the preapproved protocols. TABLE 11 Treatment Frequency of Solar- Duration of free Brimonidine Administration administration simulated Treatment follow-up Dosage tartrate (μL/mouse, on (days per UVR dose or exposure period Group Conc.

Tuesday and Thursday of each week: exposure to UVR approximately one hour before test item application. As the results shown in Table 12, topical application of brimonidine at 0.18%, 1%, and 2% concentrations surprisingly resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in UV-induced skin thickening. The UVR exposure was 600 RBU/week for all test groups in the table. TABLE 12 Group Comparisons of Skin Thickening Prevalence Group Vehicle 0.18% 1% 2% UV control UV treatment Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Male tested 36 36 36 36 36 Skin 589/35 514/34 392/27** 367/24** 797/35 Thickening Female tested 36 36 36 36 36 Skin 554/33 521/32 374/25** 381/23** 577/34 Thickening **p < 0.01 compared to the vehicle control group Total number of observations/number of mice with observation: 171 (males) and 181 females. Although treatment with 0.18% (w/w) brimonidine did not statistically reduce the UV-induced skin thickness, the incidence of skin thickening in this treatment group was still observably lower than that in the UV control group. Both groups treatment with 1% and 2% (w/w) brimonidine statistically reduced the UV-induced skin thickness compared to the UV control group. The observed reduction was clearly related to brimonidine as the vehicle control group has no effect compared to the UV control group alone, indicating that an alpha adrenergic receptor agonist is effective in reducing skin thickening, such as that induced by UV. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the observed reduction in the UV-induced skin thickening appeared to be due, at least in part, to the regulation of the EGFR response, e.g., by inhibiting the EGFR related keratinocyte proliferation or EGER related suppression of apoptosis when skin is stimulated by UV radiation. Thus, an alpha adrenergic receptor agonist can be used to regulate an EGFR response for the treatment of a disease or disorder associated with EGFR. EXAMPLE 6 UVB-induced Epidermal Hyperplasia Materials and Methods SKH1 mice were treated and exposed to UVB irradiation. The back skin of the mice was exposed to 120 mJ/cm2 UVB using the Biospectra system equipped with UVB sunlamps with a maximum emission peak at 312 nm. Irradiations were performed under isoflurane gaseous anesthesia. Mice were treated with vehicle (PEG400/EtOH/PHY (30/20/50) p/p) or brimonidine tartrate at 0.2% or 2%, by weight, administrated by topical application (100 μl) on a 10 cm2 area on the upper part of the back using a micropipette. The area is located on the upper part of the back to prevent the animals from liking themselves. Three applications were performed according to the following two treatment schedules: (a) pre-treatment: one application 1 hour prior to UVB irradiation, followed by two more applications 23 hours apart; (b) post-treatment: one application immediately following the UVB irradiation, followed by two more applications 23 hours apart. A compound reference, i.e., an EGFR inhibitor at 4%, by weight, in EtOH/H2O (76/24) was also administrated according to the pre-treatment schedule. One hour after the third topical treatment and one hour before euthanasia, mice received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) at 100 mg/kg. After mouse euthanasia using cervical dislocation, the back skin was removed and immediately fixed in formol. The formol-fixed skin samples were embedded in paraffin and then submitted to immunohistological studies for epidermal thickness and EdU detection. For epidermal thickness, two sections of 7 μm per animal were stained in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. Skin histology and the epidermis thickness were analyzed using image analysis (mScope 3.9, Aurora mScope) on scanned slide pictures (NanoZoomer C9600-12, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K). For EdU detection, two or three sections of 7 μm per animal were submitted to EdU staining. Briefly, paraffin sections were rehydrated and were incubated 30 minutes with Click-iT® reaction cocktail (Click-iT® EdU Imaging Kit with Alexa Fluor® 594 Azide from Life Technologies). Nuclei were also stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) diluted at 5 mg/mL in Vectashield Hard Set Mounting medium for Fluorescence (ref: H-1400 Vector Laboratories). The number of keratinocytes stained with Alexa Fluor® 594 was counted from digital images (NanoZoomer C9600-12, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K) and the epidermis length of each section determined using an in house dedicated tool. Data Analysis Data were analyzed using unpaired t test for validation of the UVB irradiation and one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test for the analysis of the treatment effect (Prism 6; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, Calif., USA). A p value of less than 0.05 was regarded as significant. Results The effect of brimonidine tartrate after topical administration on the murine UVB-induced epidermal hyperplasia model was evaluated. The histological analysis of H&E stained skin sections showed that UVB irradiation at 120 mJ/cm2 on mouse skin produces epidermal acanthosis (thickening of the skin) highly visible 48 hours following the irradiation (epidermis thickness increased by +127% in comparison with vehicle-treated mice). This acanthosis was inhibited fully (−96%) by topical pre-treatment with a reference treatment of an EGFR inhibitor at 4% (w/w) and partially (−23%) by the application of brimonidine tartrate at 2% (w/w), each was applied one hour before UVB irradiation and then twice more at 23 hours apart. However no effect was observed with a lower dose of 0.2% (w/w) brimonidine tartrate. In order to exclude a UVB-filter effect of brimonidine and support a pharmacological activity, the same experiments were conducted according to the post-treatment schedule. Similar results were obtained in this case with a slight decrease of the epidermal thickness with 0.2% (w/w) brimonidine tartrate, and a largest and significant decrease with 2% (w/w) brimonidine tartrate (−16% and −32% respectively). To better characterize the effect of brimonidine tartrate on epidermal hyperplasia, a proliferation marker was analyzed. EdU, a thymidine analogue, was incorporated into cellular DNA during DNA replication, and the incorporated EdU was detected through a “click” reaction with a fluorescent Alexa Fluor®594 azide (Zeng, Bain Res. 2010). It was confirmed that one UVB irradiation produces an increment of proliferating keratinocytes stained with Alexa Fluor®594 (more than 4 fold). As shown in FIG. 2, the reference compound EGFR inhibitor decreased by 64% the number of proliferating keratinocytes. Brimondine tartrate at 2% in pre- and post-treatment successfully reduced the number of EdU positive cells (−59% and −64% respectively). This effect was also observed with the lower dose, 0.2% brimonidine tartrate, in post-treatment (decrease of 25%). FIG. 1 shows the response of mouse skin to one UVB irradiation and the impact of 2% brimonidine tartrate treatment upon epidermis thickness. Acanthosis was inhibited by topical application of an EGFR inhibitor at 4% (w/w). H&E stained dorsal skin sections shown in FIG. 1 are as follows: Section A: non irradiated skin treated with the vehicle; Section B: non irradiated skin treated with EtOH/H2O; Section C: irradiated skin treated with vehicle according to the pre-treatment schedule; Section D: irradiated skin treated with 2% (w/w) brimonidine tartrate according to the pre-treatment schedule; Section E: irradiated skin treated with vehicle according to the post-treatment schedule; Section F: irradiated skin treated with 2% (w/w) brimonidine tartrate according to the post-treatment schedule; Section G: irradiated skin treated with EtOH/H2O according to the pre-treatment schedule; Section H: irradiated skin treated with an EGFR inhibitor at 4% (w/w) according to the pre-treatment schedule. FIG. 2 is a quantification analysis of the effects of topical application of 0.2% and 2%, by weight, brimonidine tartrate according to the pre- and post-treatment schedules on epidermal thickness. The reduction in epidermal thickness caused by a post-treatment with 2% (w/w) brimonidine tartrate was statistically significant (**p<0.01). An EGFR inhibitor at 4% (w/w) was used a reference treatment (mean±SD). FIG. 3 shows the response of mouse skin to one UVB irradiation and the impact of 2% (w/w) brimonidine tartrate treatment upon keratinocyte proliferation. Acanthosis was inhibited by topical application of an EGFR inhibitor at 4% (w/w). EdU staining (pink) and DAPI staining (blue) show keratinocyte and nuclei, respectively, in the sections shown in FIG. 3 as follows: (A)non irradiated skin treated with the vehicle; (B) non irradiated skin treated with EtOH/H2O; (C) irradiated skin treated with vehicle according to the pre-treatment schedule; (D) irradiated skin treated with 2% (w/w) brimonidine tartrate according to the pre-treatment schedule; (E) irradiated skin treated with vehicle according to the post-treatment schedule; (F) irradiated skin treated with 2% (w/w) brimonidine tartrate according to the post-treatment schedule; (G) irradiated skin treated with EtOH/H2O according to the pre-treatment schedule; (H) irradiated skin treated with an EGFR inhibitor at 4% (w/w) according to the pre-treatment schedule. FIG. 4 is a quantification analysis of the effects of topical application of 0.2% and 2%, by weight, brimonidine tartrate according to the pre- and post-treatment schedules on epidermal proliferation. EdU incorporation was calculated as the number of EdU positive cells in the basal layer of the epidermis relative to the epidermis length. The reduction in epidermal proliferation caused by a treatment with brimonidine tartrate was statistically significant (*p<0.05 and ****p<0.0001) for both doses (0.2% and 2% brimonidine tartrate) administered according to the post-treatment schedule and for the 2% brimonidine tartrate dose administered according to the pre-treatment schedule. An EGFR inhibitor at 4% (w/w) was used a reference treatment (mean±SD). EXAMPLE 7 Immunohistochemistry In a human skin biopsy, Alpha2a adrenergic receptor was detected by immunohistochemistry on vessels and on sweat glands, as it is shown in FIG. 5. Cut sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were prepared. These sections were dewaxed, and Alpha2a adrenergic receptor was detected with a polyclonal antibody (Abcam, dilution 1:10). The antibody was detected with an Ultravision detection system, AEC substrate (Termofisher). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. EXAMPLE 8 Treatment in a Hand and Foot Syndrome Animal Model Protocol for Preparation of a Chemotherapy-induced HFS Animal Model A female SD rat is used to prepare a chemotherapy-induced HFS animal model, according to the protocol described in Yokomichi (Yokomichi et al., Pathogenesis of Hand-Foot Syndrome induced by PEG-modified liposomal Doxorubicin, Hum Cell. March 2013; 26(1): 8-18), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Briefly, a PEG-modified liposomal doxorubicin formulation (PEGL-DOX), a chemotherapy drug commonly used against recurrent ovarian cancer, is administered at 5 or 10 mg/kg to seven week old female SD rats via tail vain injection once every 3 days for 10 days. The limbs are visually inspected for onset HFS 10 days later. Treatment with Brimonidine Skin tissue from the hind limbs is treated with a brimonidine topical formulation as described in any of the preceding examples. Treatment is measured by visual inspection or H&E, EdU or DAPI staining of skin tissue samples from the treatment area.
