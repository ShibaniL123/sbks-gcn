Step 2. 3-(4-Aminoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-4-chlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride
7-(2-Chlorophenyl)imidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine (0.030 g, 0.12 mmol) in DCM (10 mL) and under N2 at 0° C. was treated with chlorosulfonic acid (0.081 mL, 1.22 mmol), added dropwise. The ice bath was removed. The mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 1 hour, followed by heating to 50° C. overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM and added to stirred ice water. After the ice melted, layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2×). The combined extracts were dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The product was purified by flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient from 0-100%, EtOAc in Hexanes, and was isolated as a light yellow oil (0.030 g, 71%). LCMS for C11H5Cl2N5O2S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=344.0, found 344.0.
