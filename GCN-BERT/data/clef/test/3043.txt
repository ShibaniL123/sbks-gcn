Example 22A
Methyl 6-formyl-3-methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylate
5.0 g (12.4 mmol) of the compound from example 14A were dissolved in 98 ml of anhydrous THF under argon, and the mixture was cooled to −50° C. This was followed by successive dropwise addition of 35.4 ml (37.2 mmol) of a 1.05 M solution of isopropylmagnesium chloride/lithium chloride complex in THF and 3.2 ml (37.2 mmol) of 1,4-dioxane. The reaction mixture was stirred at −50° C. for 1 h and then cooled to −78° C. Then 9.5 ml (124 mmol) of absolute DMF were added dropwise. The reaction mixture was brought to RT while stirring overnight, and ethyl acetate and water were then added. The phases were separated, and the organic phase was washed once with water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. In the attempt to purify the residue by column chromatography (silica gel, eluent: cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 6:1), the product precipitated out on the column. The chromatographic purification was then stopped and the silica gel was stirred with ethyl acetate. After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was stirred in methanol, and the solid was filtered off and dried under reduced pressure. This gave 2.29 g (59% of theory, purity 98%) of the title compound
