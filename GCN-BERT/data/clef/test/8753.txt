[001 ] EXTRACTION OF GOLD FROM FINE CARBON RESIDUE [002] BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [003] Field of the Invention [004] The present invention relates in general to system and method of gold recovery and in particular, to a method of recovering gold from fine carbon residue produced during a process in which gold is recovered from its ores using activated coarse carbon. [005] Description of Related Art [006] The processes in which gold is recovered from its ores using activated coarse carbon are very well known and have been in use for a number of years. The disadvantage of the conventional coarse carbon gold recovery methods is that during the process of gold recovery, the activated coarse carbon is eventually reduced in size into a gold-loaded fine carbon, which are disposed in the tailings as waste due to the very high cost of recovering (or extracting) the remaining gold from the gold-loaded fine carbon. [007] Accordingly, there is a need for recovery of gold from gold-loaded fine carbon, which due to its high dispersion ability and developed surface accumulates significant quantity of precious metal, but resists processing by known methods. [008] BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [009] A non-limiting, exemplary aspect of the present invention provides a method for recovering gold from gold-loaded fine carbon, comprising: oxidizing the gold-loaded fine carbon, resulting in a non-carbonaceous gold-bearing residue Μ. [0010] Another non-limiting, exemplary aspect of the present invention provides a method for recovering gold from gold-loaded fine carbon comprising: mechanical and chemical treatment of gold-loaded fine carbon concurrently with thermal application in presence of one or more oxidation facilitator compounds and one or more sources of oxygen, resulting in a non-carbonaceous gold-bearing residue Μ while preventing vitrification of impurities found in the gold-loaded fine carbon that block recovery of gold. [0011] Such stated advantages of the invention are only examples and should not be construed as limiting the present invention. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of preferred non-limiting exemplary embodiments, taken together with the drawings and the claims that follow. [0012] BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0013] It is to be understood that the drawings are to be used for the purposes of exemplary illustration only and not as a definition of the limits of the invention. Throughout the disclosure, the word “exemplary” may be used to mean “serving as an example, instance, or illustration,” but the absence of the term “exemplary” does not denote a limiting embodiment. Any embodiment described as “exemplary” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. In the drawings, like reference character(s) present corresponding part(s) throughout. [0014] FIG. 1 is a non-limiting, exemplary system overview of extraction of gold from gold-loaded fine carbon in accordance with the present invention; and [0015] FIGS. 2A and 2Β are non-limiting, exemplary detailed illustrations of a system and method of extraction of gold from gold-loaded fine carbon in accordance with the present invention; and [0016] FIGS. 3 A and 3Β are non-limiting, exemplary schematic illustrations of a cylindrical vessel shown in FIG. 2Α, including an exemplary disc in accordance with the present invention. [0017] DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0018] The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention and is not intended to represent the only forms in which the present invention may be constructed and or utilized. [0019] FIG. 1 is a non-limiting, exemplary system overview of extraction of gold from gold-loaded fine carbon in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated, the present invention provides a system and a method 100 for recovering gold 102 from gold-loaded fine carbon 104, which may have resulted from a conventional coarse carbon gold recovery process 106. The present invention provides a system and a method for low temperature gasification 108 of carbonaceous compounds (carbon particles) of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104, which results in a ηοηcarbonaceous gold-bearing residue 110, where gold is recovered from the ηοηcarbonaceous gold-bearing residue 110 by any well known conventional gold recovery methods 106. Non-limiting, non-exhaustive listings of examples of conventional gold recovery methods 106 may include, for example, Carbon-In-Leach, Carbon-In-Pulp, etc. The well-known methods use the well-known process of gold cyanidation technique for extracting gold from ore, than using the common process of Carbon-In-Pulp (CIP) or Carbon-In-Leach (CIL) for final recovery of the leached gold. [0020] The low temperature gasification 108 of carbonaceous compounds (carbon particles) of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 includes impregnating the gold-loaded fine carbon with oxygen, and then oxidizing of carbon particles of the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon, which results in a non-carbonaceous gold-bearing residue Μ as follows: MC + 02 => Μ + C02 where C is carbon, O is oxygen. Thereafter, gold from the non-carbonaceous gold-bearing residue 110 may be recovered by well known conventional gold recovery methods 106. [0021] It should be noted that gold-loaded fine carbon 104 generally include graphite-like structures that are mixtures of oxides, silicates, and carbonates of Na, Κ, Si, and others (SiC>2, AfiCfi, etc.) that increase their mechanical structural firmness and increase their resistance to chemical reaction (oxidation). Conventional methods may use application of high levels of thermal energy such as application of high temperatures of heat (higher than about 650 °C) to forcibly bum off the carbon particles of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104. However, application of high temperatures (higher than 650 °C) to forcibly bum the carbon particles generally results in the vitrification of the graphite-like stmctures of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104. Asa result, any gold within the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 is encapsulated or covered within a vitreous film (or layer), preventing further extraction of gold. Accordingly, the present invention provides a system and a method 100 that enables oxidation of the carbon particles of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 at low temperatures, which obviate difficulties related to any potential vitrification of the graphite-like stmctures of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104. As detailed below, the present invention provides a thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime to commence the low temperature oxidation (gasification process 108) of carbonaceous compounds (carbon particles) of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104, which results in the ηοηcarbonaceous gold-bearing residue 110. [0022] FIGS. 2A and 2Β are non-limiting, exemplary detailed illustrations of a system and method of extraction of gold from gold-loaded fine carbon in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated and detailed further below, thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime of the present invention increases the speed of gasification of carbon particles of the gold-loaded fine carbons 104, and includes mechanical treatment of and concurrent thermal application (of less than 650 °C) to gold-loaded fine carbons 104 in the presence of oxidation facilitator compounds and oxygen sources (dopants). In general and as further detailed below, the mechanical treatment of the gold-loaded fine carbons 104 increase the surface areas and concentrations of defects of the graphite-like crystal stmctures therein, and the concurrent application of thermal energy intensifies the oxidation process in the presents of the oxidation facilitator compounds and oxygen sources (dopants). [0023] As illustrated FIG. 2A, prior to the application of thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime of the present invention, the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 is first impregnated with oxygen using an aqueous reagent solution 202, which in general, is comprised of one or more oxidation facilitator compounds mixed with one or more sources of oxygen in water. Non-limiting, non-exhaustive listings of the one or more oxidation facilitator compounds may include a combination of oxides, but preferably, hydroxides of alkali metals, and the sources of oxygen may be derived from various oxygen reach dopants. Non-limiting, non-exhaustive listing of the oxygen reach dopants may be selected from nitrates (e.g., ΚΝΟ3, №ΝΟ3, ΝΗ4ΝΟ3), persulfates (e.g., K2S2O8 (NH4), S2O8, Na2S208), permanganates (e.g., ΚΜηΟ4), or others. [0024] In general, the hydroxides of alkali metals facilitate the oxidation process by the following well known processes: • formations of phenolate groups, which deform and destruct Carbon-Carbon (C-C) bonds; • Isomerization of phenolate groups of carbon derivatives with formation of carbonate and transfer charges; • formations of intercalates that facilitate penetration of oxygen Ο2 into interlayer space forming graphite oxide; and • formations of potassium intercalcatus along with the graphite oxide, carbon atoms of which being in SP3 orbital configuration contribute to disruptive oxidation of polycyclic natural structures with rupture of C-C bonds along peripheral areas of graphite and basic areas, which strongly accelerate the oxidation process. [0025] Preparing the aqueous reagent solution 202 includes dissolving a predetermined quantity of hydroxides of alkali metals in water, and then adding of oxygen dopants to the aqueous solution of hydroxides of alkali metals to form the aqueous reagent solution 202. Thereafter, adding the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 to the aqueous reagent solution 202 while mixing the aqueous reagent solution in a mixer 204 to impregnate the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 with oxygen to generate a gold-loaded fine carbon that is impregnated with oxygen. [0026] In general, as a non-limiting example, approximately 1 kg of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 may be mixed with approximately 0.1 to about 0.3 dm3 of aqueous reagent solution 204 to form the oxygen reach impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208. Non-limiting examples of concentrations of the hydroxides of alkali metals in the mixture 204 may be approximately 0.05 to about 0.5 % over 100% weight of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 and oxygen reach dopants included may comprise of approximately 0.1 to about 1% over 100% weight of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104. In general, non-limiting example of duration of mixing 204 is approximately from about 10 to about 20 minutes (preferably 15 minutes) at a temperature of approximately 20 °C+/- 10 °C (preferably 25 °C (+/- 5 °C), which is ambient room temperature). [0027] In general, conventional coarse carbon gold recovery methods 106 (e.g., gold cyanidation) use an aqueous based solution as a medium for the gold recovery process and hence, in most instances, the resulting gold-loaded fine carbon 104 is screened, filtered, or removed out of the entire process mixed within the aqueous based solution. In general, (optionally) it is preferred if the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 is separated 206 from the aqueous based solution prior to processing by the methodologies of the present invention simply because the actual amount of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 collected takes much less space to store for later processing than the entire aqueous based solution mixture that includes the gold-loaded fine carbon 104. The optional step of filtering, removal, or separation 206 of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 from the aqueous based solution may be accomplished by a variety of well-known manners, non-limiting examples of which may include a simple sedimentation process where the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 settles and is collected at a bottom of a collector tank, and then removed or separated. Another very simple method of separation is to simply allow the aqueous solution to evaporate, leaving behind the gold-loaded fine carbon 104, ready for mixing 204. [0028] As further illustrated in FIG. 2Α, the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 is then put through a thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime to commence the low temperature oxidation (gasification process 108) of carbonaceous compounds (carbon particles). As stated above, the thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime includes the mechanical treatment of and concurrent thermal application to the oxygen reach impregnated gold loaded fine carbon 208, resulting in chemical activation (oxidation) of carbon particles to form non-carbonaceous gold-bearing residue 110 without vitrification of impurities found in the gold-loaded fine carbon 104. [0029] In general, the mechanical treatment of the impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 is to increase its surface area, increase the concentration of defects of crystal structure graphite, and removal of diffusion drag during chemical reaction, which may be accomplished by milling of the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 to small particle sizes that are less than 100 micron, preferably to about 50 to 60 microns. The diffusion drag is the result of film, layer, or covering of residue on the surface of the remaining oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 due to further milling and application of heat. The diffusion drag is the impedance or slowing down of penetration of oxygen gas and heat into the remaining oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208. The diffusion drag therefore, impedes the gasification of the carbon particles of the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208, and is removed by the applied mechanical motion of the milling balls 218 impacted against the fine carbon 208. In other words, the residue that causes the diffusion drag is mechanical removed when milling elements 218 come into contact with the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 to further mill the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208. [0030] In general, the concurrent thermal application of the thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime (concurrent in relation to the mechanical treatment) may include heating the impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 to a temperature of less than 650 °C, preferably to about 500 °C +/- 50 °C (to avoid vitrification) for a predetermined time (about 4 to 4.5 hours). The chemical activation occurs when the sources of oxygen (the dopans added to the aqueous reagent solution 202) actively isolate oxygen at proper temperature and mechanical activation within the defected areas of the carbon (due to mechanical treatments), oxidizing (gasifying) the graphite-like parts of the carbon particles within the gold-loaded fine carbon. [0031] As further illustrated in FIG. 2Α, processing the impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 through the thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime includes the use of a rotary mill-kiln 210 in accordance with the present invention for oxidation of carbon. The rotary mill-kiln 210 of the present invention includes a rotating body 212 that has a milling zone 214 that mill the impregnated oxygen reach gold-loaded fine carbon 208 into small size particles of less than 100 micron (preferably 50 to 60 microns), with the milling zone 214 including a heat source 216 (electric or combustion) for application of thermal energy to generate heat at approximate temperatures of about 450 °C to 550 °C for sufficient duration (about 4 to 4.5 hours) for conversion of impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 into non-carbonaceous gold-bearing residue 110. In general, the mechanical milling of the impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 leads to irregular solid structures that serve to increase the speed or rate of oxidation of carbon (increase reactivity). The gold from the residue 110 may be recovered by well-known conventional gold recovery methods 106 (FIG. 2Β). [0032] As further illustrated in FIG. 2Α, the rotating body 212 of the rotary mill-kiln 210 of the present invention includes milling elements (or ball mills) 218 that freely move within the milling zone 214 of the rotating body 212 to grind and crush the impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208. The rotating body 212 is comprised of a cylindrical vessel that has a central longitudinal pivot axis 220 about which the rotating body 212 pivots. The cylindrical vessel has an ingress end (or loading chamber) 222 and an egress end (unloading chamber) 224 that rest on a set of rotation mechanisms 226 that cause the rotation of the cylindrical vessel 212 about the central longitudinal pivot axis 220. In general, the rotational mechanism 226 may comprise of well-known members such as rollers, motors, etc. to facilitate in rotation of the body 212. The entire rotary mill-kiln 210 may rest on a base-stand 228 at a slight sloping angle, with the ingress side at a higher elevation than the egress side. [0033] As indicated above, the cylindrical vessel 212 of the rotary mill-kiln 210 includes the milling elements 218 therein that freely move and are maintained within a partition section (the milling zone) 214 of the cylindrical vessel 212 by a set of partitions 230 and 232. The partitions 230 and 232 are comprised of disc-like structures (best illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3Β) with at least one hole 234, and are coupled with the interior surface of the cylindrical vessel 212 by a variety of means, including, for example, welding the discs 230 and 232 to the interior surface of the cylindrical vessel 212. In general, the diameter 306 of the hole 234 of the disc-like structures 230 and 232 is of sufficient size that allows the passage of oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 while maintaining the milling balls 218 within the partitioned section 214. In other words, the solid body portion 302 of the disc-like structures 230 and 232 has sufficient height 304 that block the milling elements (or balls) 218 from moving outside the partitioned section 214. That is, the milling balls 218 have sufficient weight that cannot overcome the height 304 of the discs 230 and 232 during rotation of the cylindrical vessel 212 (which moves milling balls 218 within the partitioned chamber 214). It is preferable if the partitions 230 and 232 are coupled with the interior surface of the cylindrical vessel 212 at an orientation that is generally perpendicular to the central longitudinal pivot axis 220, with the hole 234 at the center of the discs 230 and 232. It should be noted that the discs 230 and 232 need not have a single hole, but may comprise of a plurality of smaller holes, forming a grill-like structure instead of the single hole 234, with diameters of the grill openings small enough that would continue to block the exit of the milling elements 218 from the partitioned chamber 214. Alternatively, the hole 234 may be eccentric (off-centered) so long as the body 302 of the discs 230 and 232 continue to maintain the milling elements 218 within the partitioned chamber 214. [0034] Referring back to FIG. 2Α, as the cylindrical vessel 212 of the rotary mill-kiln 210 rotates about its axis 220 (the discs 230 and 232 welded to the interior surface thereof also rotate), the milling balls 218 move within the partitioned chamber 214 to mill the oxygen reach impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 and hence, provide the required mechanical impact (milling) of the thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime of the present invention. Concurrently, heat at a temperature of about 500 °C +/- 50 °C is also supplied via the heat source 216 to provide the required thermochemical activation of the thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime of the present invention for gasification of the oxygen reach impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208. [0035] As illustrated in FIG. 2Α, oxygen reach impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 enters the rotary mill-kiln 210 via a feed 236 and is moved into the first zone or chamber 238 by an augur 240 through the ingress end (or loading chamber) 222. The first zone or chamber 238 may be thought of as an initial drying zone within which the oxygen reach impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 is substantially dried by thermal application of heat via a heat source 242 (electric or combustion) at an approximate temperature of about 200 °C for a sufficient duration (about 0.5 hour) for substantial removal of moisture (to evaporate water). It should be noted that the process of heating at 200 °C also commences and aids in the oxidation of carbons. Thereafter, the substantially dried oxygen reach impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 is passed through the hole 234 of the first disc 230 and into the milling zone 214. [0036] As further illustrated in FIG. 2A, the cylindrical vessel 212 further includes the final oxidation zone 244 that continues to apply thermal energy in a form of heat at an approximate temperature of about 450 °C to 550 °C via a heat source 246 (electrical or combustion) for predetermined time of about 1 to about 1.5 hours, where non-carbonaceous gold-bearing residue 110 exits via the egress end (unloading chamber) 224 and is collected and process by conventional gold recovery process 106 for extraction of gold 102. Most gases (including water vapor) are exhausted through the exhaust 250. [0037] In general, any one or more of the following non-catalyst chemical reactions (gasification) may occur (or concurrently occur) in any one or more of the partitioned zones 238, 214, and 244 in relation to the carbon particles of the oxygen reach impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208: C(soiid) + Ο2 => CO2 + Q (94 kcal) 2C(soiid) + 02 => 2CO + Q (52.8 kcal) C(soiid) + CO2 => 2CO - (Q (41.2 kcal) C(soiid) + H20(gas) => CO + H2 - Q (31.4 kcal) C(soiid) + 2H20(gas) => CO2 + H2 - Q (21.6 kcal) resulting in the non-carbonaceous gold-bearing residue 110, where C is carbon, Ο is oxygen, Η is hydrogen, Q is energy (with “+Q” being exothermic and “-Q” being endothermic). The above reactions may be generalized as follows where Sold + Gas => Gaseous Products + non-carbonaceous gold-bearing residue 110. It should be noted that water (Η2Ο) is the result of the mixture of the gold-loaded fine carbon 104 with the aqueous reagent solution 202 at mixing 204, which forms the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208. [0038] Examples of the above described thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime in accordance with the present invention are presented in tabular form in Table 1. [0039] TABLE 1 Processing of Gold-Loaded Fine Carbon Batch # Partitioned Chamber 214 Regime (Temperature & Time) Mass Loss, % Au Yield, % 1 350 °C to 370 °C and 3 Hours 23 85.4 2 400 °C to 450 °C and 4 Hours 22.4 89 to 90 3 450 °C to 500 °C and 4 Hours 24 91 to 92 4 500 °C to 520 °C and 4.5 Hours 25 97 to 98 [0040] For the above examples shown in table 1, a single batch of gold-loaded fine carbon 104 was used and divided into four smaller, substantially equal batches, with each smaller batch processed separately. It should be noted that batch #2 had lesser amount of gold-loaded fine carbon 104 and hence, the reason for lesser mass loss. Nonetheless, the percentage of gold yielded for this batch #2 is about 89% to 90%, which is higher than the first batch due to higher temperature and duration of thermo-kinetic chemical activation processing. [0041] As indicated in the above table 1, in order to extract the highest percentage of gold (batch #4), the optimum temperature and time for the middle partitioned chamber or zone 214 is approximately at 500 °C to 520 °C for about 4.5 hours, which generates a mass loss of about 25 % (gasification of carbon), with a gold yield of about 97% to 98%. The optimum temperature and time (batch #4) for the first partitioned chamber 238 is at approximate temperature of about 200 °C for about 0.5 hours, and the optimal temperature and time (batch #4) for the final partitioned chamber 244 operations is at approximately 500 °C to 520 °C for about 1 hour. Stated otherwise, the total optimal operation time (batch #4) through the thermo-kinetic chemical activation process in accordance with the present invention is approximately 6 hours. It should be noted that although optimally the entire process takes place in about 6 hours, the second zone 214 preferably has a minimum processing time of about 4 to 4.5 hours, with the rest of the other two zones 238 and 244 dividing the remaining time preferably, with the zone 238 being about 0.5 hour and zone 244 about 1.5 hours. [0042] The rate at which (and the amount of) the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 that is fed into the rotary mill-kiln 210, and the rate at which (and the amount of) the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 that is processed through each partitioned chamber or zone 238, 214, and 244 depends on many factors, including the dimensions of the rotary mill-kiln 210. [0043] In general, the time τ, it takes for any other matter or substance to enter, pass through, and exit a well known, conventional, average sized rotary-kiln (which are not partitioned and do not have a milling zone) would be substantially shorter (than 4 hours), which is dictated by the following formula: [0044] = 0.19L nSD ’ [0045] wherein L is the axial length of the entire cylindrical vessel of a conventional rotary kiln, η is the number of rotations per minute, S is the inclinations (or slope) of the cylindrical vessel (with the ingress side at a higher elevation than the egress side), and D is the inner diameter of the cylindrical vessel. Accordingly, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the time for processing matter within a conventional rotary kiln is not sufficient and hence, should be longer than or be modified to some other time r2 (e.g., minimum of about 4 hours) that is required for the completion of the thermo-kinetic chemical activation regime of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention has modified the conventional rotary kiln into the illustrated rotary mill-kiln 210 by the partitioning discs 230 and 232, which slow the travel time of the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 through the cylindrical vessel 212 to the preferred time of about 6 hours, which means r2 > τ,. Accordingly, the partitioning discs 230 and 232 server to contain the milling elements 218 within the partitioned chamber 214 (as indicated above) and also serve to slow the travel time of the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 throughout the entire axial length L of the cylindrical vessel 212. In the exemplary rotary mill-kiln 210 illustrated in accordance with the present invention, the non-limiting, exemplary dimensions used for experiments indicated in table 1 above may be as follows: Partitioned Chamber 238 Partitioned Chamber 214 Partitioned Chamber 244 Ll= 0.5m Vl= 0.15m3 L2= 4m V2= 1.2m3 L3= 1.5m V3= 0.45m3 [0046] [0047] In general, the height 304 (FIGS. 3Α and 3Β) of the body 302 of the discs 230 and 232 creates a barrier, which generates the maximum amount or volume Vn of the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 that may be maintained and processed within each chamber 238, 214, and 244 without the fine carbon 208 exiting the respective chamber and into the next, subsequent chamber through hole 234 of the discs 230 and 232. (The highest level is at the tangent line 308 shown in FIG. 3Β, above which, the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 will spill over the next, subseauent chamber.) Therefore, the rate at which (and the amount of) the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 that is fed into the rotary mill-kiln 210, and the rate at which (and the amount of) the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 that is processed through each chamber or zone 238, 214, and 244 depends on the capacity of each chamber in terms of volume VN (VI, V2, and V3 best shown in FIG. 3Α) created within the respective chambers 238, 214, and 244 by the height 304 of body 302 of each disc 230 and 232, the longitudinal axial length Ln of each chamber 238, 214, and 244, and the arc of the cylindrical vessel 212. In the instant invention, the chamber 238 has the shortest length LI, the milling zone or chamber 214 has longest length L2, and the final zone or chamber 244 has a length L3 with a span that is between the lengths LI and L2 of the respective first and second chambers 238 and 214, with the height 304 being the same for all partitions. This results in the travel time for the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 through each respective chamber 238, 214, and 244 is equal to about 0.5 hours for the first chamber 238, about 4 hours for the milling zone chamber 214, and about 1.5 hours for the final zone 244. Therefore, increasing the volume Vn or capacity for each chamber would allow for processing of a larger amount of the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 within the preferred minimum 4 hours, and decreasing the volume VN would require processing of lesser amount of the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208 within the preferred minimum 4 hours. [0048] Although the invention has been described in considerable detail in language specific to structural features and or method acts, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. Rather, the specific features and acts are disclosed as exemplary preferred forms of implementing the claimed invention. Stated otherwise, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein, as well as the abstract, are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. Therefore, while exemplary illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described, numerous variations and alternative embodiments will occur to those skilled in the art. For example, the partitioning of the cylindrical vessel 212 in accordance with the present preferred embodiment enables continuous operation (processing) of the oxygen impregnated gold-loaded fine carbon 208. However, alternatively, it is possible to remove the partitions 230 and 230, increase the number of milling elements 218 so that they are spread throughout the interior chamber of the cylindrical vessel (i.e., the entire cylindrical vessel 212 becomes chamber 214), and allow a batch processing (thermo-kinetic chemical activation in batches) of the oxygen impregnated go Id-loaded fine carbon 208. In this alternative method, each batch is processed for duration of about 4 to 6 hours at an approximate temperature of 500 °C (+/- 50 °C). Of course, continuous processing is more efficient and therefore, preferred over batch processing. Such variations and alternate embodiments are contemplated, and can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
