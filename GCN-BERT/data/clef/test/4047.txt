Porcine parvovirus The present invention relates to a novel porcine parvovirus, to proteins of the virus and to vaccines based upon the virus and proteins thereof. The invention also relates to DNA fragments comprising a gene of the virus and to DNA vaccines based upon genes of the virus. Further the invention relates to antibodies that are reactive with the novel virus and to diagnostic tests for the detection of the virus or antibodies against the virus. Over the last decades, world-wide a strong increase is seen in the consumption of pig meat. As a consequence, an increase is seen in the number and the size of farms, in order to meet the increasing needs of the market. As is known from animal husbandry in general, large numbers of animals living closely together are vulnerable to all kinds of diseases, even diseases hardly known or seen or even unknown before the days of large-scale commercial farming. One of the diseases in pigs that has been known for over 60 years now is haemorrhagic bowel syndrome (HBS). This disease is referred to as a syndrome due to the fact that the cause of the disease is not clear and the consistency of the various clinical signs is not always fully clear. HBS is a disease that occurs in infrequent, explosive outbreaks. Rapidly growing swine of 4-6 months old are primarily affected. In most cases, the disease is observed in fattening pigs. Pigs die suddenly without evidence of diarrhea, although the extent of mortality varies (1 3). Swiss autopsy data, based on more than 16000 pigs, showed an incidence of HBS of 2.66%. In the USA, HBS is reported to cause 0.5%-7% of all mortalities during the growth-finish phase (3). Hemorrhagic bowel syndrome should not be seen as a single disease with a single cause. The most prominent symptom of HBS is intestinal hemorrhages, often accompanied by intestinal volvulus (torsions of the intestine). However, these symptoms are also an indication for gastric ulcers and ileitis, which complicates the diagnosis of HBS. Rotation of the entire intestine may occur, causing blood to pool and stagnate. Intestinal volvulus can be observed in up to 80% of the HBS cases (1 3). Other frequently noticed symptoms of the disease are thin intestinal walls, and bloody fluid in the intestines. The precise etiology of HBS is unclear. As indicated above, rather than having a single cause, the etiology of the syndrome is most likely multifactorial. Stress, several environmental and management aspects may play a role. Predisposing factors may include vigorous exercise, handling, fighting, piling, or irregular feeding. There is no conclusive evidence that an infectious agent (bacterial or viral) can cause HBS (1'3), although Clostridium sp. and E. coli have been isolated from animals suffering from HBS. Attempts to reproduce disease by administering filtered intestinal contents from animals suffering from HBS, intravenously or orally, to healthy animals failed. Attempts to reproduce disease by oral inoculation of E. coli and Clostridium perfringens type A isolated from infected swine equally failed. On the other hand it is known that the frequency of the disease can be lowered to a certain extent by the administration of antibiotics in the feed. This strengthens the idea that the disease is indeed multifactorial: a combined effect of e.g. stress, and one or more pathogens. It is an objective of the present invention to provide a new infectious agent associated with this disease as well as vaccines aiming at combating the disease or at least decreasing the mortality of the disease. Moreover, it is an objective of the present invention to provide means to detect and identify the disease- associated infectious agent. Recently, HBS-diagnosed pigs were collected from several farms during an outbreak of disease in Mexico. The affected pigs didn't have previous symptoms of disease and died suddenly, between 2 and 6 hours after first signs of illness. On necropsy the pigs showed abnormalities in small intestine, i.a. hemorrhagic symptoms, a thin intestinal wall and bloody fluids in the intestines. No abnormalities were found in other organs, except for observations of enlarged, swollen reddish lymph nodes. The disease was confirmed as HBS. Samples from necropsied affected pigs from various farms were analysed for the presence of viruses and surprisingly a novel virus was found in 76% of the animals. The fact that the virus was not detected in all animals may have to do with the amount of time passed between the death of the animals and the moment they were submitted to post-mortem section. This can i.a. be concluded from the fact that the amounts of virus found per animal varied to a great extent. It is contemplated by the inventors that in the pigs in which the virus is seemingly absent, this is likely due to the fact that the amount of virus present was in those pigs below the detection level at the moment of analysis. Furthermore, the site of initial virus replication is not known for this novel virus, and thus the primary site of virus replication after infection may not have been sampled. Since the novel virus was detected in these HBS-diagnosed pigs, the virus will be further referred to as HBS -associated virus. Haemorrhagic bowel syndrome can now be characterized by the presence of the novel virus according to the invention at some stage during the disease in organs of animals suffering from HBS, in combination with the following clinical symptoms: intestinal hemorrhages, often accompanied by intestinal volvulus, thin intestinal walls and bloody fluids in the intestines. The sequence of the viral genome was analysed and revealed that the novel virus bears some albeit a relatively low level of resemblance to a recently identified genus of the Parvovirinae subfamily within the Parvoviridae. Parvoviruses are linear, non-segmented single-stranded DNA viruses, with an average genome size of 5000 nucleotides and a size in the range of 18-26 nm in diameter. The almost full length DNA sequence of a representative of the new porcine parvovirus is presented in SEQ ID NO: 10. The novel virus comprises two large Open Reading Frames (ORFs): ORFl encoding nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) consisting of 662 amino acids is found at position 0134-2122 of SEQ ID NO: 10 and ORF2 encoding Capsid Protein (CP) consisting of 1189 amino acids is found at position 2130-5699 of SEQ ID NO: 10. An example of the DNA sequence of ORF2, the gene encoding the Capsid Protein, is depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1. SEQ ID NO: 2 represents the amino acid sequence of the Capsid Protein. An example of the DNA sequence of ORFl encoding nonstructural protein NS1 is depicted in SEQ ID NO: 3. SEQ ID NO: 4 represents the amino acid sequence of the nonstructural protein NS1. The sub-family of the Parvovirinae currently comprises 7 genera (15): 1) PARV4-like virus 2) Erythrovirus 3) Bocavirus 4) Dependovirus 5) Amdovirus 6) Parvovirus 7) A newly proposed parvo clade At this moment, six different parvoviruses have been identified that infect pigs: a) Classic porcine parvovirus type 1 (PPV1), a member of the genus Parvovirus b) porcine parvovirus type 2 (PPV2), a member of the genus PARV4-like virus c) porcine parvovirus type 3 (PPV3, also known as porcine PARV4, hokovirus or partetravirus), also a member of the genus PARV4-like virus d) porcine parvovirus type 4 (PPV4), a member of the newly proposed clade e) porcine parvovirus type 5 (PPV5), also a member of the newly proposed clade f) porcine bocavirus (PBoV), a member of the genus Bocavirus PPV1 is known to be the causative agent of SMEDI, a syndrome connected with stillbirth, mummification, embryonic death and infertility. (4'5) PPV2 is not known to cause disease as such, but is suggested to be a co-factor in the development of Porcine Circovirus Associated Disease (PCVAD) (6'7). PPV3 is also not known to cause disease as such, but is possibly also a co-factor in the development of Porcine Circovirus Associated Disease (PCVAD) (8 11). PPV4 was isolated originally from lung tissue of pigs. The tissue appeared to be co-infected with porcine circovirus. Is not known to cause disease and has also not convincingly been associated with a disease caused by another pathogen (12 14). PPV5 is also not known to cause any symptoms or lesions and is not associated with a disease caused by another pathogen (15 16). Porcine Bocavirus is a relatively new type of porcine parvovirus for which clinical significance and epidemiology are largely unexplored yet (17). The amino acid sequences of ORF1 and ORF2 of the novel virus were used to make phylogenetic trees based on the Maximum Likelihood method, the Poisson correction model and bootstrap analysis (500 replicates). These trees were made using the program MEGA, version 5, using standard settings. (MEGA5: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis Using Maximum Likelihood, Evolutionary Distance, and Maximum Parsimony Methods. Koichiro Tamura, Daniel Peterson, Nicholas Peterson, Glen Stecher, Masatoshi Nei and Sudhir Kumar. Mol. Biol. Evol. 28(10): 2731-2739. 2011 doi:10.1093/molbev/msrl21 Advance Access publication May 4, 2011). The phylogenetic tree of ORF1 is presented in figure 1, that of ORF2 in figure 2. The percentage bootstrap support is specified at the nodes. Distance bars indicate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. As follows from these phylogenetic trees, the novel porcine parvovirus is more related to Porcine Parvovirus 5 (PPV5) and Porcine Parvovirus 4 (PPV4) than to PPV1, 2 or 3, or the Bocaviruses. It was found that both the NS1 coding sequence and the Capsid Protein coding sequence shows a certain fit in that part of the Parvovirinae phylogenetic tree that also comprises the unrelated viruses PPV4 and PPV5. For this reason the inventors decided to tentatively place the novel virus in the group of the new clade viruses. However, the sequence identity with existing Porcine parvoviruses even within the group of the new clade virus is relatively low. For this reason it is even conceivable that the novel virus belongs to a new genus within the family Parvovirinae. SEQ ID NO: 1 and 3 show typical examples of the nucleotide sequence of the genes encoding the Capsid Protein and the nonstructural protein NSl of a virus according to the invention. It will be understood that for these proteins natural variations can exist between individual representatives of the HBS-associated virus. Genetic variations leading to minor changes in e.g. the Capsid Protein sequence do exist. This is equally true for the NSl gene. First of all, there is the so-called "wobble in the second and third base" explaining that nucleotide changes may occur that remain unnoticed in the amino acid sequence they encode: e.g. triplets TTA, TTG, TCA, TCT, TCG and TCC all encode Leucine. In addition, minor variations between representatives of the novel porcine parvovirus according to the invention may be seen in amino acid sequence. These variations can be reflected by (an) amino acid difference(s) in the overall sequence or by deletions, substitutions, insertions, inversions or additions of (an) amino acid(s) in said sequence. Amino acid substitutions which do not essentially alter biological and immunological activities, have been described, e.g. by Neurath et al in "The Proteins" Academic Press New York (1979). Amino acid replacements between related amino acids or replacements which have occurred frequently in evolution are, inter alia, Ser/Ala, Ser/Gly, Asp/Gly, Asp/Asn, Ile/Val (see Dayhof, M.D., Atlas of protein sequence and structure, Nat. Biomed. Res. Found., Washington D.C., 1978, vol. 5, suppl. 3). Other amino acid substitutions include Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/Thr, Ser/Asn, Ala/Val, Thr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Leu/Ile, Leu/Val and Ala/Glu. Based on this information, Lipman and Pearson developed a method for rapid and sensitive protein comparison (Science 227, 1435-1441, 1985) and determining the functional similarity between homologous proteins. Such amino acid substitutions of the exemplary embodiments of this invention, as well as variations having deletions and/or insertions are within the scope of the invention. This explains why the Capsid Protein and the nonstructural protein NSl, when isolated from different representatives of a porcine parvovirus according to the invention, may have homology levels that are significantly below 100%, while still representing the Capsid Protein and the nonstructural protein NSl of the porcine parvovirus according to the invention. This is clearly reflected e.g. in the phylogenetic tree in figure 1 of a paper by Xiao et al.,(6) where it is shown that even within one single genus the PARV4-like virus genus consisting of highly related parvoviruses nevertheless have significantly different overall genomic nucleotide sequences as well as significantly different NSl gene nucleotide sequences. Thus, the virus according to the invention is described i.a. as an isolated virus which is a member of the sub-family Parvovirinae of the family of the Parvoviridae, said virus being characterized in that a) the virus is an HBS-associated virus and b) the virus has a viral genome comprising a gene encoding a Capsid Protein (CP), wherein the nucleotide sequence of the CP gene has a level of identity of at least 80% to the nucleotide sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1. For the purpose of this invention, a level of identity is to be understood as the level of identity of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and the corresponding region encoding the Capsid Protein of a porcine parvovirus of which the level of identity has to be determined. A suitable program for the determination of a level of identity is the nucleotide blast program (blastn) of NCBFs Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, using the "Align two or more sequences" option and standard settings (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). For the purpose of this invention, isolated means: set free from tissue with which the virus is associated in nature. An example of an isolated virus is the virus as present in cell culture. A preferred form of this embodiment relates to a virus that has a Capsid Protein gene that has a level of identity of at least 82%, more preferably 84%, 86%, 88%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%> or even 100%, in that order of preference, to the nucleotide sequence of the Capsid Protein as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1. An alternative way to describe the virus according to the present invention relates to the sequence of the NSl gene of the virus. SEQ ID NO: 3 shows a typical example of the nucleotide sequence of the NSl gene of a virus according to the invention. As explained above, natural variations leading to minor changes in the NSl sequence are however found. Thus, a virus according to the invention can thus also be described as an isolated virus which is a member of the sub-family Parvovirinae of the family of the Parvoviridae, said virus being characterized in that a) the virus is an HBS-associated virus and b) the virus has a viral genome comprising a gene encoding a non-structural protein 1 (NSl), wherein the nucleotide sequence of the NSl gene has a level of identity of at least 80% to the nucleotide sequence as depicted i SEQ ID NO: 3. A preferred form of this embodiment relates to such a virus that has an NSl gene that has a level of identity of at least 82%, more preferably 84%, 86%, 88%, 90%, 91 %, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%> or even 100%, in that order of preference, to the nucleotide sequence of the NSl gene as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 3. Thus, in summary a virus according to the present invention is an isolated vims which is a member of the sub-family Parvovirinae of the family of the Parvoviridae, said vims being characterized in that a) the virus is an H BS-associated virus and b) the virus has a viral genome comprising a gene encoding a Capsid Protein (CP) and a gene encoding a non-structural protein 1 (NSl), wherein the nucleotide sequence of the CP gene has a level of identity of at least 80%) to the nucleotide sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1 or the nucleotide sequence of the NSl gene has a level of identity of at least 80% to the nucleotide sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 3. A preferred form of this embodiment relates to an isolated virus which is a member of the sub-family Parvovirinae of the family of the Parvoviridae, said virus being characterized in that a) the virus is an H BS-associated virus and b) the virus has a viral genome comprising a gene encoding a Capsid Protein (CP) and a gene encoding a non-structural protein 1 (NSl), wherein the nucleotide sequence of the CP gene has a level of identity at least 80%) to the nucleotide sequence as depicted in SEQ I D NO: 1 and the nucleotide sequence of the NSl gene has a level of identity of at least 80%) to the nucleotide sequence as depicted in SEQ I D NO: 3. Still another, alternative, way to characterize the virus according to the invention depends on a PCR-test using primer sets that are specific for the Capsid Protein gene sequence or the NSl gene sequence of a virus according to the invention. Two different primer sets of which the sequence is depicted in SEQ ID NO: 5-6 and SEQ ID NO: 7-8 were elected for their specificity for the virus. The PCR-test using the first primer set (SEQ ID NO: 5-6) that specifically reacts with the Capsid Protein gene of the virus uses the two primers Bowl_Q_ORF2_FW : CTACATCTGCGCCTGAC and Bowl_Q_ORF2_REV : GTGGTGAGAAGGCAAGAC, For Quantitative(Q)-PCR experiments, the PCR probe BOW1_Q_ORF2_PROBE : 6FAM- CACGAGCTAGAGCGTGCTAAACAG-BHQl as depicted in SEQ DI NO.: 9 is used in addition to these two primers. The PCR-test using the second primer set (SEQ ID NO: 7-8) specifically reacts with the NS1 gene of the virus and uses the two primers BOW1_ORFI_774_F : TGTTGAGTGTGGTGGATTGG and Bowl_ORFl_1626_R: AAGGAAGCTGGACCGAGAG. The tests, which are described in more detail in the Examples section, are standard PCR tests. If a member of the of the subfamily of the Parvovirinae subfamily within the Parvoviridae is analysed using the primer sets described above, the following can be said: if an analysis of the PCR-product of the first primer set reveals a PCR product of approximately 140 base pairs or if analysis of the PCR-product of the second primer set reveals a PCR product of approximately 853 base pairs, this unequivocally demonstrates that the analysed virus belongs to the virus according to the invention. Merely as an example: a PCR product of approximately 853 base pairs is a PCR product with a length of between 853 + 10 and 853 - 10 base pairs. A PCR product of approximately 140 base pairs is a PCR product with a length of between 140 + 10 and 140 - 10 base pairs. Thus again another form of this embodiment of the present invention relates to an isolated virus which is a member of the of the subfamily of the Parvovirinae subfamily within the Parvoviridae, characterized in that: a) the virus is an HBS-associated virus and b) the viral genomic DNA reacts in a PCR reaction with a primer set as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 5 and 6 to give a PCR product of 140 +/- 10 base pairs or reacts in a PCR reaction with a primer set as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 7 and 8 to give a PCR product of 853 +/- 10 base pairs. A preferred form of this embodiment relates to a virus according to the invention wherein the viral genomic DNA reacts in a PCR reaction with a primer set as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 5 and 6 to give a PCR product of 140 +/- 10 base pairs and reacts in a PCR reaction with a primer set as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 7 and 8 to give a PCR product of 853 +/- 10 base pairs. A more preferred form of this embodiment relates to a virus according to the invention wherein the virus has a viral genome comprising a gene encoding a Capsid Protein (CP) and a gene encoding a nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), wherein the nucleotide sequence of the CP gene has a level of identity of at least 80% to the nucleotide sequence as depicted in SEQ I D NO: 1 or the nucleotide sequence of the NS l gene has a level of identity of at least 80% to the nucleotide sequence as depicted in SEQ 1 D NO: 3 and wherein the viral genomic DNA reacts in a PCR reaction with a primer set as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 5 and 6 to give a PCR product of 140 +/- 10 base pairs and reacts in a PCR reaction with a primer set as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 7 and 8 to give a PCR product of 853 +/- 10 base pairs. The virus according to the invention can be in a live, a live attenuated or an inactivated form. As indicated above, the DNA sequences of the genes encoding the CP and NSlof the virus have now been characterized. The identification of these genes is highly useful, since they can now be used i.a. as a basis for DNA-vaccines, for use in the preparation of subunit vaccines on the basis of these proteins or for diagnostic purposes, as will extensively be explained below. Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a DNA fragment comprising a gene encoding a Capsid Protein characterized in that that gene has a level of identity of at least 80% to the nucleotide sequence of the CP gene as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1. A preferred form of this embodiment relates to such a DNA fragment comprising a gene having a level of identity of at least 82%, more preferably 84%, 86%, 88%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%> or even 100%, in that order of preference, to the nucleotide sequence of the CP as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1. Again another embodiment of the present invention relates to a DNA fragment comprising a gene encoding an NS1 characterized in that that gene has a level of identity of at least 80%> to the nucleotide sequence of the NS1 gene as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 3. A preferred form of this embodiment relates to such a DNA fragment comprising a gene having a level of identity of at least 82%, more preferably 84%, 86%, 88%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%> or even 100%, in that order of preference, to the nucleotide sequence of the NS1 as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 3. Still another embodiment of the present invention relates to a CP characterized in that this CP is encoded by a DNA fragment encoding a CP according to the invention. Such CPs of the virus according to the invention are highly suitable because they are suitable for use in vaccines, more specifically in subunit vaccines, they can be used to raise antibodies and they make diagnostic tests possible, as explained below. A preferred form of this embodiment relates to a CP having the amino acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 2. Again another embodiment of the present invention relates to an NS1, characterized in that that NS1 is encoded by a DNA fragment encoding an NS1 according to the invention. Such NSl 's of the virus according to the invention are highly suitable i.a. because they make diagnostic tests possible, as explained below. A preferred form of this embodiment relates to an NS1 having the amino acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 4. It is one of the merits of the present invention that it is now for the first time possible to follow the course of viral infection and to analyse the presence or absence of the novel virus in the various organs and body fluids of pigs suffering from HBS. This helped to gain more insight in the development of disease. It is known that in the weeks or even days before an individual pig shows full clinical signs of HBS, no abnormalities are found. The average timing between the first symptoms and death of the animals is about 2-6 hours. Shortly before death, the animals seem to suffer from abdominal distension and some of them scream before dying. The animals on the farms that developed clinical signs were euthanized before they died of the disease. On the various Mexican farms from which HBS-pigs were collected, the HBS-incidence varied between 1 -2%. A total of 33 euthanized HBS-diagnosed animals collected from different farms, one group of 17 aged between 18-27 weeks (Example 1) and one group of 16 aged between 12-26 weeks (Example 2), were analysed. PCR reactions with the primer sets as described above revealed that in group 1, 5 out of 14 sera (3 sera were missing from the collection) were found positive for the virus and one rectal swap was found positive. A total of 8 full blood samples was found positive, and 12 out of 15 lymph nodes were found positive . In group 2, 5 out of 16 sera were positive for the virus and one rectal swap was found positive. From a representative animal of each group (animal 2 group 1, animal 10 group 2), organs were analysed for the presence of the virus. It was found that all sampled organs including lymph nodes, lung, spleen, intestine, kidney and liver, as well as feces tested positive for the virus. It is another merit of the present invention that it is now possible to infect healthy pigs with the novel virus and to examine the route of viral infection. With this aim, organ material and feces from HBS-animals were homogenized in tissue culture medium. The homogenates were freeze-thawed once (-70°C), centrifuged and filtered on 5 μιη, 0.45 μιη and 0.22 μιη filters to remove remaining tissue material. An inoculum A was made of the following material of a representative animal: feces, lymph nodes, lung, spleen and intestine of animal 10 group 2. An inoculum B was made of the following material of another representative animal: feces, lymph nodes, lung, kidney and liver of animal 2 group 1. Full details of these experiments are given in the Examples section below (Example 3). The inoculums (A or B) were given as a 4 x 2mL IM dose and an oral dose of 20 ml to a total of 4 Boars and 8 gilts (Landrace / high health status / SPF) of 12-14 weeks of age at time of inoculation as follows: Group 1 : five animals, of which three animals received inoculum A, two served as contact sentinels. Group 2 : four animals, of which three animals received inoculum B, one served as contact sentinel. Group 3 : three animals, all of which received inoculum B. One animal (male) was sacrificed prior to inoculation and served as negative control. The animals were screened for presence of the novel virus in serum, feces, nasal swaps and eye swaps prior to inoculation. Blood samples, rectal/nasal/eye swaps were taken at several time points. Full details of the animal experiments are given in the Examples section below. It was found that in 6 out of 6 inoculated animals the virus could be detected in serum as well as in rectal, nasal and eye swaps at 7 days after inoculation. In all of the 3 non-inoculated animals, the sentinels, the virus could be detected in the serum at 14 days after the inoculation of the other animals. Rectal/nasal and eye swaps of all sentinel animals were positive at day 7 after inoculation (Example 3, groups 1 ,2). In 3 out of 3 sera of inoculated animals on day 3 post inoculation, virus was detected (Example 3, group 3). Thus, although it is true that the incidence of HBS is reported to be relatively low, given the highly contagious nature of the virus in combination with its high speed of infection, it may be expected that by far most, if not all, pigs in farms where HBS occurs will experience an infection with the virus. It is therefore highly advisable to vaccinate all animals in farms where HBS occurs, against infection with the HBS-associated porcine parvovirus according to the invention. Such vaccination would eradicate at least a viral component of the multifactorial syndrome. And this in turn would prevent or at least decrease the severity of the disease. It is also one of the merits of the present invention that since the novel porcine parvovirus has now been isolated and associated with HBS, the virus and/or protective subunits of the virus can be used as the starting material for vaccination purposes. Thus, another embodiment of the present invention relates to vaccines for combating HBS in pigs, wherein such vaccines comprise a virus according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that are suitable for use in a vaccine according to the invention are sterile water, saline, aqueous buffers such as PBS and the like. In addition a vaccine according to the invention may comprise other additives such as adjuvants, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and others, as described below. Combating in this respect should be interpreted in a broad sense: combating HBS is considered to comprise vaccination in order to prevent the signs of the disease as well as vaccination to diminish the signs of the disease as outlined above. Therapeutic vaccination once the virus is diagnosed in an infected animal that is not yet suffering from the syndrome is of course equally efficient. Therapeutic vaccination after the syndrome is diagnosed would seem not efficient, given the very short time between first clinical signs and death. A vaccine according to the invention may comprise the virus according to the invention in attenuated live or inactivated form. Attenuated live virus vaccines, i.e. vaccines comprising the virus according to the invention in a live attenuated form, have the advantage over inactivated vaccines that they best mimic the natural way of infection. In addition, their replicating abilities allow vaccination with low amounts of viruses; their number will automatically increase until it reaches the trigger level of the immune system. From that moment on, the immune system will be triggered and will finally eliminate the viruses. A live attenuated virus is a virus that has a decreased level of virulence when compared to virus isolated from the field. A virus having a decreased level of virulence is considered a virus that even in combination with other factors involved in HBS does not induce mortality in pigs. Therefore, one preferred form of this embodiment of the invention relates to a vaccine comprising a virus according to the invention wherein said virus is in a live attenuated form. Attenuated viruses can e.g. be obtained by growing the viruses according to the invention in the presence of a mutagenic agent, followed by selection of virus that shows a decrease in progeny level and/or in replication speed. Many such agents are known in the art. Another very often used method is serial in vitro passage. Viruses then get adapted to the cell line used for the serial passage, so that they behave attenuated when transferred to the natural host again as a vaccine. Still another way of obtaining attenuated viruses is to subject them to growth under temperatures deviating from the temperature of their natural habitat. Selection methods for temperature sensitive mutants (Ts- mutants) are well-known in the art. Such methods comprise growing viruses in the presence of a mutagen followed by growth at a sub-optimal temperature and at the optimal temperature, titration of progeny virus on cell layers and visual selection of those plaques that grow slower at the optimal temperature. Such small plaques comprise slow-growing and thus desired live attenuated viruses. Live attenuated vaccines for combatting porcine parvovirus type PPV have been described i.a. by Paul & Mengeling (32), by Paul & Mengeling (33) and by Fujisaki e& Murakami (34). A possible disadvantage of the use of live attenuated viruses however might be that inherently there is a certain level of virulence left. This is not a real disadvantage as long as the level of virulence is acceptable, i.e. as long as the vaccine at least prevents the pigs from dying. Of course, the lower the rest virulence of the live attenuated vaccine is, the less influence the vaccination has on weight gain during/after vaccination. Inactivated vaccines are, in contrast to their live attenuated counterparts, inherently safe, because there is no rest virulence left. In spite of the fact that they usually comprise a somewhat higher dose of viruses compared to live attenuated vaccines, they may e.g. be the preferred form of vaccine in pigs that are suffering already from other diseases. Pigs that are kept under sub-optimal conditions, such as incomplete nutrition or sub-optimal housing would also benefit from inactivated vaccines. Therefore, another preferred form of this embodiment relates to a vaccine comprising a virus according to the invention wherein said virus is in an inactivated form. It is known that whole inactivated parvoviruses in general, be it porcine or canine parvoviruses, are an very efficient and safe basis for vaccines. Merely as an example: MSD AH (Boxmeer, The Netherlands) produces a commercially available inactivated porcine parvovirus type PPV vaccine: Porcilis Parvo. Hipra (Spain) also produces a commercially available inactivated porcine parvovirus type PPV vaccine: PARVOSUIN® MR/AD. Zoetis produces an inactivated Canine parvovirus: PARVAC and an inactivated porcine parvovirus type PPV vaccine: Porcine PARVAC. Novartis provides methods for the inactivation of parvovirus in US-Patent US4193991. Such inactivated whole virus vaccines can equally be made for the novel porcine parvovirus according to the invention. As is the case for known parvovirus vaccines, the production basically comprises the steps of growing the novel parvovirus on susceptible porcine cells, harvesting the virus, inactivating the virus and mixing the inactivated virus with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The standard way of inactivation is a classical treatment with formaldehyde. Other methods well-known in the art for inactivation are UV-radiation, gamma-radiation, treatment with binary ethylene- imine, thimerosal and the like. The skilled person knows how to apply these methods. Preferably the virus is inactivated with β-propiolactone, glutaraldehyde, ethylene-imine or formaldehyde. It goes without saying that other ways of inactivating the virus are also embodied in the present invention. As indicated above, the virus can be grown in cell culture on susceptible porcine cells or cell lines. Thus, another embodiment of the invention relates to a cell culture comprising a HBS -associated porcine parvovirus according to the present invention. Examples of cells and cell lines are SK6, PK15, primary or immortalized porcine kidney cells, primary or immortalized porcine alveolar lung macrophages. Practically the whole viral genome of the novel porcine parvovirus has now been determined and the DNA sequence of a representative of the novel virus is presented in SEQ ID NO: 10. The Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) of the genome are not presented here. Since parvoviruses by definition belong to the smallest viruses known, the whole ss-DNA encoding the parvovirus according to the invention can easily be made synthetically. For this reason, the parvovirus can easily be made in vivo using the viral DNA as starting material. The Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) of the genome of other, known, parvovirus such as i.a. described by Qiu et al. (37) and by Wang et al. (38) can be used to complete the viral genome as presented in SEQ ID NO: 10. The ITRs merely play a role in the replication of the viral genome, and as such they are not relevant from an immunological point of view. Thus for the purpose of producing a virus according to the invention the ITRs are interchangeable. Cloning of full-length parvoviral DNA into a plasmid such as e.g. Bluescript II SK, and the subsequent generation of whole parvovirus through transfection of porcine cells with an expression plasmid encoding the novel porcine parvovirus is i.a. described by Qiu et al. (37) and by Wang et al. (38). A permissive cell line such as SK6, PK15, primary or immortalized porcine kidney cells, primary or immortalized porcine alveolar lung macrophages would be the preferred cell line for this purpose. Nevertheless, if desired non- permissive cell lines can also be used: the genome of the novel parvovirus can i.a. be replicated in non- permissive cells with the help of adenovirus genes as described by Guan et al. (39). Although whole inactivated parvoviruses provide a good basis for vaccines, their production may be expensive, depending i.a. upon the type of host cells used, the substrate and the cell culture medium used. In the specific case of parvoviruses, an attractive alternative for the use of whole viruses is the use of parvovirus CP subunits, more preferably subunits in the form of so-called empty capsids. Such empty capsids are basically virus-like particles that however do not comprise the parvoviral genome. As a consequence, parvoviral empty capsid particles do not have to be inactivated before use in a vaccine, and therefore they have the additional advantage that they are intrinsically safe. Empty capsids can be obtained by mere expression of ORF2 encoding the Capsid Protein, in a suitable expression system. The so-formed capsid protein self-assembles into empty virus particles. Parvoviral empty capsids can readily be made in large amounts and they are highly immunogenic. By far most expression systems currently in use for making parvoviral empty capsids are baculovirus- based expression systems. Methods for the production of highly immunogenic parvovirus empty capsids in baculovirus-based expression systems have been e.g. described for porcine parvovirus type PPV by Martinez (18), Casal (19), Zhou et al. (20) and by Hao Feng (21). For other parvoviruses, such methods have been described e.g. by Saliki (22) and by Brown (23). Furthermore, baculovirus expression systems and baculovirus expression vectors in general have been described extensively in textbooks such as by O'Reilly at al. (24) and Murhammer (25). Baculovirus-based expression systems are also commercially available, e.g. from Invitrogen Corporation, 1600 Faraday Avenue, Carlsbad, California 92008, USA. An alternative for Baculovirus-based expression systems are yeast-based expression systems. Yeast expression systems are e.g. described by Gellissen et al. (29). Ready-to-use expression systems are i.a. commercially available from Research Corp. Technologies, 5210 East Williams Circle, Suite 240, Tucson, AZ 85711-4410 USA. Yeast and insect cell expression systems are also e.g. commercially available from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. 4030 Fabian Way, Palo Alto, California 94303-4607, USA. Expression of the Capsid Protein is of course also possible in mammalian cell based expression systems as known in the art, but these systems would most likely be more expensive to use, when compared to the baculovirus-based expression systems. Thus another form of this embodiment relates to a vaccine for combating HBS -associated porcine parvovirus in pigs, characterized in that said vaccine comprises an immunogenically effective amount of a Capsid Protein according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A preferred form of this embodiment relates to a vaccine for combating HBS-associated porcine parvovirus in pigs, characterized in that said vaccine comprises an immunogenically effective amount of a Capsid Protein according to the invention in the form of empty capsids. The amount of empty capsids in a vaccine and the route of administration would be comparable with that of inactivated whole virus particles, since in terms of immunogenicity and similarity of the capsid they are comparable to inactivated whole virus particles. Usually, an amount of between 1 and 100 μg of the novel parvovirus empty capsids would be very suitable as a vaccine dose. From a point of view of costs, a preferred amount would be in the range of 1 -50 μg of empty capsids, more preferred in the range of 1 -25 μg. Casal (19) describes that for both canine parvovirus and porcine parvovirus doses as low as 1-3 μg in the presence of conventional adjuvants confer total protection on the corresponding host against the disease. A vaccine according to the invention on the basis of inactivated whole virus or empty capsids preferably comprises an adjuvant. Conventional adjuvants, well-known in the art are e.g. Freund's Complete and (R) Incomplete adjuvant, vitamin E, non-ionic block polymers, muramyl dipeptides, Quill A , mineral oil (R) (R) (R) (R) e.g. Bayol or Markol , vegetable oil, and Carbopol (a homopolymer), or Diluvac Forte. The vaccine may also comprise a so-called "vehicle". A vehicle is a compound to which the polypeptide adheres, without being covalently bound to it. Often used vehicle compounds are e.g. aluminum hydroxide, -phosphate or -oxide, silica, Kaolin, and Bentonite. Casal (19) successfully used i.a. aluminum hydroxide and Quill A in his parvovirus vaccines. In principle a vaccine according to the invention can be given just once. However, especially in the case of inactivated vaccines, be it whole virus vaccines or empty capsid vaccines, preferably also a first and possibly a second booster vaccination is given. A first booster would usually be given at least two weeks after the first vaccination. A very suitable moment for a booster vaccination is between 3 and 16 weeks after the first vaccination. A second booster, if necessary, would usually be given between 4 and 50 weeks after the first booster. An alternative to the inactivated whole virus vaccine approach and the empty capsid vaccine approach is the use of live recombinant non-parvovirus vectors that have pigs as their host animal, as carriers of the novel porcine parvoviral Capsid Protein gene. Amongst the suitable recombinant non-parvovirus vectors that have pigs as their host animal, two vectors are especially suitable as carriers: Pseudorabies virus (PRV) and Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV). The use of such recombinant viruses in vaccines has the additional advantage that the vaccinated animals become at the same time vaccinated against both PRV and PPV or CSFV and PPV. Chen et al. (27) describe the construction and use of a live attenuated PRV recombinant vector expressing a porcine parvovirus type PPV Capsid Protein. This PRV recombinant was administered to eight -day-old piglets in an amount of 5xl05TCID50 and this amount of vaccine proved to be safe and provided an excellent immunity against both PRV and PPV. Live attenuated CSFV vectors are also very suitable as live recombinant vectors. Merely as an example; live attenuated CSFV from which the Npro gene has been deleted, has been described by Mayer et al.(28) Such a live attenuated virus allows, i.a. at the site of the deletion of the Npro gene, for the insertion of the gene encoding the Capsid Protein. Such a live recombinant CSFV vector equally forms a suitable carrier for the novel porcine parvoviral Capsid Protein gene. The expression of the Capsid Protein gene can be brought under the control of any suitable heterologous promoter that is functional in a mammalian cell (see below). A heterologous promoter is a promoter that is not the promoter responsible for the transcription of the CP gene in the wild-type form of the novel porcine parvovirus according to the invention. It may be a parvoviral promoter responsible for the transcription of a CP or NS1 of another parvovirus, that does not belong to the parvoviruses according to the invention or it may be a non-parvoviral promoter. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention relates to a DNA fragment comprising a gene encoding a CP according to the invention, characterized in that said gene is under the control of a functional heterologous promoter. Chen et al(27) made use of the CMV promoter for driving the expression of the Capsid protein gene, but other suitable promoters that are functional in a mammalian cell are known in the art. A promoter that is functional in a mammalian cell is a promoter that is capable of driving the transcription of a gene that is located downstream of the promoter in a mammalian cell. Examples of suitable promoters that are functional in a mammalian cell include classic promoters such as the (human) cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (Seed, B. et al., Nature 329, 840-842, 1987; Fynan, E.F. et al., PNAS 90, 11478-11482,1993; Ulmer, J.B. et al., Science 259, 1745-1748, 1993), Rous sarcoma virus LTR (RSV, Gorman, CM. et al., PNAS 79, 6777-6781, 1982; Fynan et al., supra; Ulmer et al., supra), the MPSV LTR (Stacey et al., J. Virology 50, 725-732, 1984), SV40 immediate early promoter (Sprague J. et al., J. Virology 45, 773 ,1983), the SV-40 promoter (Berman, P.W. et al., Science, 222, 524- 527, 1983), the metallothionein promoter (Brinster, R.L. et al., Nature 296, 39-42, 1982), the heat shock promoter (Voellmy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82, 4949-53, 1985), the major late promoter of Ad2 and the β-actin promoter (Tang et al., Nature 356, 152-154, 1992). The regulatory sequences may also include terminator and poly-adenylation sequences. Amongst the sequences that can be used are the well- known bovine growth hormone poly-adenylation sequence, the SV40 poly-adenylation sequence, the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) terminator and poly-adenylation sequences. Thus another form of this embodiment relates to a vaccine for combating HBS -associated porcine parvovirus in pigs, characterized in that said vaccine comprises a live recombinant non-parvovirus vector comprising a DNA fragment comprising a gene encoding a CP according to the invention under the control of a functional promoter and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. It goes without saying that the live recombinant non-parvovirus vector should be expressing an immunogenically effective amount of the Capsid Protein. An alternative for vaccination with an inactivated whole virus vaccine, an empty capsid vaccine or a live recombinant non-parvovirus vector, is the use of DNA vaccination. Such DNA vaccination is based upon the introduction of a DNA fragment carrying the gene encoding the Capsid Protein under the control of a suitable promoter, into the host animal. Once the DNA is taken up by the host's cells, the gene encoding the Capsid Protein is transcribed and the transcript is translated into Capsid Protein in the host's cells. This closely mimics the natural infection process of the parvovirus. Suitable promoters are promoters that are functional in mammalian cells, as exemplified above. A DNA fragment carrying the gene encoding the Capsid Protein under the control of a suitable promoter could e.g. be a plasmid. This plasmid may be in a circular or linear form. Examples of successful DNA vaccination of pigs are i.a. the successful vaccination against Aujeszky's disease as described in Gerdts et al. (30), Journal of General Virology 78: 2139-2146 (1997). They describe a DNA vaccine wherein a DNA fragment is used that carries glycoprotein C under the control of the major immediate early promoter of human cytomegalovirus. Vaccination was done four times with two weeks intervals with an amount of 50 μg of DNA. Vaccinated animals developed serum antibodies that recognized the respective antigen in an immunoblot and that exhibited neutralizing activity. Another example of successful DNA vaccination of pigs is given by Gorres et al. (31). They described successful DNA vaccination of pigs against both pandemic and classical swine H1N1 influenza. They vaccinated with a prime vaccination and 2 homologous boosts at 3 and 6 weeks post priming, of a DNA vaccine comprising the HA gene of influenza H1N1 under the control of a functional promoter. Therefore, again another form of this embodiment relates to a vaccine for combating HBS-associated porcine parvovirus in pigs, characterized in that said vaccine comprises a DNA fragment comprising a gene encoding a Capsid Protein according to the present invention under the control of a functional promoter, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. It goes without saying that the DNA fragment comprising a gene encoding a Capsid Protein should be expressing an immunogenically effective amount of the Capsid Protein. What constitutes an "immunogenically effective amount" for a vaccine according to the invention that is based upon a whole parvovirus according to the invention, an empty capsid according to the invention, a live recombinant vector or a DNA vaccine according to the invention depends on the desired effect and on the target organism. The term "immunogenically effective amount" as used herein relates to the amount of parvovirus, empty capsid, live recombinant vector or DNA vaccine that is necessary to induce an immune response in pigs to the extent that it decreases the pathological effects caused by infection with a wild-type HBS-associated porcine parvovirus, when compared to the pathological effects caused by infection with a wild-type HBS- associated porcine parvovirus in non-immunized pigs. It is well within the capacity of the skilled person to determine whether a treatment is "immunologically effective", for instance by administering an experimental challenge infection to vaccinated animals and next determining a target animal's clinical signs of disease, serological parameters or by measuring re- isolation of the pathogen, followed by comparison of these findings with those observed in field- infected pigs. The amount of virus administered will depend on the route of administration, the presence of an adjuvant and the moment of administration. A preferred amount of a live vaccine comprising virus according to the invention is expressed for instance as Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50). For instance for a live virus a dose range between 10 and 109 TCID50 per animal dose may advantageously be used, depending on the rest virulence of the virus. Preferably a range between 102 and 106 TCID50 is used. Many ways of administration can be applied, all known in the art. Vaccines according to the invention are preferably administered to the animal via injection (intramuscular or via the intraperitoneal route) or per OS. The protocol for the administration can be optimized in accordance with standard vaccination practice. In all cases, administration through an intradermal injector (IDAL) is a preferred way of administration. If a vaccine comprises inactivated virus or empty capsids according to the invention, the dose would also be expressed as the number of virus particles to be administered. The dose would usually be somewhat higher when compared to the administration of live virus particles, because live virus particles replicate to a certain extent in the target animal, before they are removed by the immune system. For vaccines on the basis of inactivated virus, an amount of virus particles in the range of about 104 to 109 particles would usually be suitable, depending on the adjuvant used. If a vaccine comprises subunits, e.g. the CP according to the invention, the dose could also be expressed in micrograms of protein. For vaccines on the basis of subunits, a suitable dose would usually be in the range between 5 and 500 micrograms of protein, again depending on the adjuvant used. If a vaccine comprises a DNA fragment comprising a gene encoding the Capsid Protein, the dose would be expressed in micrograms of DNA. For vaccines on the basis of subunits, a suitable dose would usually be in the range between 5 and 500 micrograms of DNA, i.a. depending on the efficiency of the expression plasmid used. In many cases an amount of between 20 and 50 micrograms of plasmid per animal would be sufficient for an effective vaccination. A vaccine according to the invention may take any form that is suitable for administration in the context of pig farming, and that matches the desired route of application and desired effect. Preparation of a vaccine according to the invention is carried out by means conventional for the skilled person. Oral routes are preferred when it comes to ease of administration of the vaccine. For oral administration the vaccine is preferably mixed with a suitable carrier for oral administration i.e. cellulose, food or a metabolisable substance such as alpha-cellulose or different oils of vegetable or animal origin. In practice, swine are vaccinated against a number of pathogenic viruses or micro-organisms. Therefore it is highly attractive, both for practical and economic reasons, to combine a vaccine according to the invention for pigs with e.g. an additional immunogen of a virus or micro-organism pathogenic to pigs, or genetic information encoding an immunogen of said virus or micro-organism. Thus, a preferred form of this embodiment relates to a vaccine according to the invention, wherein that vaccine comprises at least one other pig-pathogenic microorganism or pig-pathogenic virus and/or at least one other immunogenic component and/or genetic material encoding said other immunogenic component, of said pig-pathogenic microorganism or pig-pathogenic virus. An immunogen or immunogenic component is a compound that induces an immune response in an animal. It can e.g. be a whole virus or bacterium, or a protein or a sugar moiety of that virus or bacterium. The most common pathogenic viruses and micro-organisms that are pathogenic for swine are Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, African Swine Fever virus, Nipah virus, Porcine Circovirus, Porcine Torque Teno virus, Pseudorabies virus, Porcine influenza virus, Porcine parvovirus, Porcine respiratory and Reproductive syndrome virus (PRRS), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDV), Foot and Mouth disease virus, Transmissible gastro-enteritis virus, Rotavirus, Escherichia coli, Erysipelo rhusiopathiae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Salmonella cholerasuis, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Therefore, a more preferred form of the invention relates to a vaccine according to the invention, wherein the virus or micro-organism pathogenic to swine is selected from the group of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, African Swine Fever virus, Nipah virus, Porcine Circovirus, Porcine Torque Teno virus, Pseudorabies virus, Porcine influenza virus, Porcine parvovirus, Porcine respiratory and Reproductive syndrome virus (PRRS), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDV), Foot and Mouth disease virus, Transmissible gastro-enteritis virus, Rotavirus, Escherichia coli, Erysipelo rhusiopathiae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Salmonella cholerasuis, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Still another embodiment relates to a method for the preparation of a vaccine according to the invention, wherein the method comprises the mixing of a virus according to the invention and/or an empty capsid and/or a CP according to the invention and/or a DNA fragment encoding a CP according to the invention and/or a live recombinant non-parvovirus vector encoding a CP according to the invention, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Again another embodiment of the present invention relates to a virus according to the invention and/or an empty capsid and/or a CP according to the invention and/or a DNA fragment encoding a CP according to the invention and/or a live recombinant non-parvovirus vector encoding a CP according to the invention, for use in a vaccine. As mentioned above, the haemorrhagic bowel syndrome is a multifactorial syndrome. It is a compilation of factors that eventually trigger HBS. This means that it is important to know if the HBS-associated porcine parvovirus is present in a certain pig-population well before the first clinical signs become manifest. Thus, for efficient protection against disease, a quick and correct detection of the presence of the HBS -associated porcine parvovirus is important. Therefore it is another objective of this invention to provide diagnostic tools suitable for the detection of HBS -associated porcine parvovirus. These tools partially rely on the availability of antibodies against the virus. Such antibodies can e.g. be used in diagnostic tests for HBS-associated porcine parvovirus. Antibodies or antiserum comprising antibodies against the HBS-associated porcine parvovirus according to the invention can quickly and easily be obtained through vaccination of e.g. pigs, poultry or e.g. rabbits with the virus according to the invention followed, after about four weeks, by bleeding, centrifugation of the coagulated blood and decanting of the sera. Such methods are well-known in the art. Other methods for the preparation of antibodies raised against the HBS-associated porcine parvovirus, which may be polyclonal, monospecific or monoclonal (or derivatives thereof) are also well-known in the art. If polyclonal antibodies are desired, techniques for producing and processing polyclonal sera are well- known in the art for decades, see e.g. Mayer and Walter (35). Monoclonal antibodies, reactive against the virus according to the invention can be prepared by immunizing inbred mice by techniques also long known in the art, see e.g. Kohler and Milstein (36). Thus, another embodiment of the present invention relates to antibodies or antisera that are reactive with the virus according to the invention. A diagnostic test kit based upon the detection of a virus according to the invention or antigenic material of that virus and therefore suitable for the detection of HBS-associated porcine parvovirus infection may e.g. comprise a standard ELISA test. In one example of such a test the walls of the wells of an ELISA plate are coated with antibodies directed against the virus. After incubation with the material to be tested, labeled antibodies reactive with the virus are added to the wells. If the material to be tested would indeed comprise the novel porcine parvovirus according to the invention, this virus would bind to the antibodies coated to the wells of the ELISA. Labeled antibodies reactive with the virus that would subsequently be added to the wells would in turn bind to the virus and a color reaction would then reveal the presence of antigenic material of the virus. Therefore, still another embodiment of the present invention relates to diagnostic test kits for the detection of a virus according to the invention or antigenic material of the virus, that comprise antibodies reactive with a virus according to the invention or with antigenic material thereof. Antigenic material of the virus is to be interpreted in a broad sense. It can be e.g. the virus in a disintegrated form, or viral envelope material comprising viral outer membrane proteins. As long as the material of the virus reacts with antiserum raised against the virus, the material is considered to be antigenic material. A diagnostic test kit based upon the detection in serum of antibodies reactive with the virus according to the invention or antigenic material of the virus and therefore suitable for the detection of HBS-associated porcine parvovirus infection may also e.g. comprise a standard ELISA test. In such a test the walls of the wells of an ELISA plate can e.g. be coated with the virus according to the invention or antigenic material thereof. After incubation with the material to be tested, e.g. serum of an animal suspected from being infected with the novel porcine parvovirus according to the invention, labeled antibodies reactive with the virus according to the invention are added to the wells. If anti- HBS-associated porcine parvovirus antibodies would be present in the tested serum, these antibodies will bind to the viruses coated to the wells of the ELISA. As a consequence the later added labeled antibodies reactive with the virus would not bind and no color reaction would be found. A lack of color reaction would thus reveal the presence of antibodies reactive with the virus according to the invention. Therefore, still another embodiment of the present invention relates to diagnostic test kits for the detection of antibodies reactive with the virus according to the invention or with antigenic material of the virus that comprise the virus according to the invention or antigenic material thereof. The design of the immunoassay may vary. For example, the immunoassay may be based upon competition or direct reaction. Furthermore, protocols may use solid supports or may use cellular material. The detection of the antibody-antigen complex may involve the use of labeled antibodies; the labels may be, for example, enzymes, fluorescent-, chemoluminescent-, radio-active- or dye molecules. Suitable methods for the detection of antibodies reactive with a virus according to the present invention in the sample include, in addition to the ELISA mentioned above, immunofluorescence test (IFT) and Western blot analysis. An alternative but quick and easy diagnostic test for diagnosing the presence or absence of a virus according to the invention is a PCR test as referred to above, comprising a PCR primer set reactive with a specific region of the CP or the NS1 gene of HBS-associated porcine parvovirus. Specific in this context means unique for e.g. the CP or the NS1 gene of HBS-associated porcine parvovirus, i.e. not present in other members of the family Parvoviridae. Preferably such a test would use the primer set (SEQ ID NO: 5-6) that specifically reacts with the Capsid Protein of the virus or the primer set (SEQ ID NO: 7-8) specifically reactive with the NS1 of the virus. It goes without saying, that more primers can be used than the primers identified above. The present invention provides for the first time the unique sequence of the CP and the NS1 gene of HBS-associated porcine parvovirus. This allows the skilled person to select without any additional efforts, other selective primers. By simple computer-analysis of the CP or the NS1 gene of HBS-associated porcine parvovirus gene sequence provided by the present invention with the, known, CP or NSl gene of other, non-HBS- associated, porcine parvovirus members of the family Parvoviridae, the skilled person is able to develop other specific PCR-primers for diagnostic tests for the detection of a HBS-associated porcine parvovirus and/or the discrimination between an HBS-associated porcine parvovirus and other viral (porcine) pathogens. PCR-primers that specifically react with the CP or the NSl gene of HBS-associated porcine parvovirus are understood to be those primers that react only with the CP or the NSl gene of HBS-associated porcine parvovirus and not with the CP or the NSl gene of another (porcine) pathogenic virus, or group of (porcine) pathogenic viruses. Thus, another embodiment relates to a diagnostic test kit for the detection of a virus according to the invention, characterised in that said test kit comprises a PCR primer set that is specifically reactive with a region of the CP or the NSl gene of HBS-associated porcine parvovirus. A preferred form of this embodiment relates to a diagnostic test kit for the detection of a virus according to the invention, characterised in that said test comprises the primer set as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 5-6 or the primer set as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 7-8.

All procedures were carried out on ice. Organs were defrosted and subsequently homogenized (10% w/v) in tissue culture medium. The homogenate was freeze-thawed once (-70°C). Subsequently, the homogenate was centrifuged and filtered on 5 μιη, 0.45 μιη and 0.22 μιη filters to remove remaining tissue material. The filtered homogenate was stored at -70°C until inoculation. Inoculums (A or B) were given as a 4 x 2mL IM dose (4 different organs, left neck, right neck, left leg, right leg) and an oral dose of 20 niL (10 feces homogenate + 4 x 2.5 ml homogenate of different organs). Inoculums were administered at room temperature.

Sentinel: day 18 p.i.; day 31 p.i Group 2: Inoculated: day 14 p.i.; day 29 p.i (2 animals) Sentinel: day 22 p.i. Group 3: Inoculated: day 4 p.i. (1 animal); day 7 p.i. (2 animals). Results PCR Animal 10 sample set 2 used for inoculum: All organs tested positive for new parvovirus: Feces, Lymph nodes, Lung, Spleen, Intestine, Kidney, Liver Animal 2 sample set 1 used for inoculum: All organs tested positive for new parvovirus: Feces, Lymph nodes, Lung, Kidney, Liver Animal experiment Result of PCR on swabs/sera: Table 4A-B-C Organ samples were taken for histology, for PCR analysis and for virus isolation. Organs for virus isolation were stored at -70°C. Hepatic lymph nodes (10% homogenates) were analysed using PCR. Group 1 : all inoculated animals serum + (positive) on day 7 Sentinel serum - (negative) on day 7 Swabs: see Table 4 A Group 2: all inoculated animals serum + on day 7 Sentinel serum - on day 7 Swabs: see Table 4B Group 3: all inoculated animals serum + on day 4 Swabs: see Table 4C PCR results Necropsied organ d. 10 p. i. (inoculum A, group 1) d. 14 p.i. (inoculum B, group 2) Serum positive positive Spleen positive positive Mesenteric Lymph Node positive positive Hepatic Lymph Node positive positive Inguinal Lymph Node positive positive Lung positive positive Tonsil positive positive Kidney positive positive Nasal mucosa positive positive Large Intestine positive positive Liver positive positive Small Intestine positive positive Stomach positive positive Brain positive positive Bile weakly positive weakly positive 50% Small Intestine Content not detected not detected 25 %> Large Intestine Content not detected not detected Urine not detected not detected Results Lymph nodes Hepatic lymph nodes of all 13 animals collected at time of necropsy were homogenized 10%> (w/v) in culture medium. DNA was isolated from the homogenate and presence of virus was analysed by PCR. The control lymph node was negative for new parvovirus, all 12 inoculated or sentinel pigs were positive for virus. Conclusion: On the basis of the data presented above, it can be concluded that the new parvovirus replicates in pigs. The route of transmission most likely oral/nasal via direct contact, but oral/fecal transmission and transmission through the air cannot be excluded. Fecal excretion is however limited. The virus is found in multiple organs. Based on the combined results in Example 1-3 it is expected that in a subset of animals; in about 1-2% of total infected animals, infection with the new parvovirus causes disease around the time of appearance of the virus in the blood (viremia). Shedding in the feces is minimal, but virus remains present in the blood > 30 days after infection. Also nasal and eye swabs remain PCR positive >30 days after infection. In the infected pigs as described in Example 3, no hemorrhagic bowel syndrome was observed, but this was to be expected, based on both a low incidence of the disease; 1 -2%> in general population and the fact that the animals used in Example 3 were relatively young and in excellent condition. They had, other than pigs in a commercial farm setting, no predisposing risk factors.
