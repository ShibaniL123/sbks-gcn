TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing sesquiterpene lactone derivative as active ingredient for treating the gastrointestinal diseases. More particularly, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing sesquiterpene lactone derivative derived from parthenolide as active ingredient for treating or preventing the gastrointestinal diseases, such as, the gastritis and/or stomach ulcer. DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART It has been reported that sesquiterpene lactone compounds, such as, epi-tulipinolide, parthenolide, costunolide, tulipinolide, liferolide and/or dihydrochrysanolide are included in the extract from the bark of Liriodendron tulipifera (please refer to R W Doskotch, S L Keely, C D Hufford, F S El-Feraly, Phytochemistry, 14:769-773(1975); R W Doskotch, J H Wilton, F M Harraz, E H Fairchild, C- T Huang, F S El-Feraly, J. Nat. Prod, 46:923-929 (1983)). Especially, parthenolide has been known as useful active ingredient in the extract of the bark of Liriodendron tulipifera. Therefore, parthenolide has been used for treating the disease. Further, it has been known that parthenolide can modulate the inflammatory disease mediated by NF-κB in vitro, and that it also can induce the apoptosis of acute myeloid leukemia (please refer to M W Feltenstein et al, Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 79 (2): 299-302 (2004)). Further, the inhibition of NF-κB activity can be useful for treating obesity derived from lipopolysaccharide (please refer to S J Zunino et al, Cancer letters 254 (1): 119-127 (2007)). Therefore, we can anticipate that parthenolide derivative from the extract of the bark of Liriodendron tulipifera may be useful for treating inflammatory disease mediated by NF-κB. Based upon such proposition, the inventors have prepared a number of parthenolide derivatives having various kinds of substitution radicals to select useful compound for treating or preventing the gastritis and/or stomach ulcer. Further, the efficacy for treating or preventing the gastritis and/or stomach ulcer has been measured using these compounds. Because sesquiterpene lactone compounds are lipid soluble, the low solubility of sesquiterpene lactone compounds occurs in the body fluid, which can cause the insufficient bioavailability. Even though costunolide and/or tulipinolide extracted from the bark of Liriodendron tulipifera has been useful for treating the gastritis and/or stomach ulcer, these compounds showed the cytotoxicity, especially chromosomal toxicity, which causes the critical struggle for developing it as the medicine. Therefore, the inventors of present application have synthesized a number of compounds suitable for treating the gastritis and/or stomach ulcer without showing cytotoxicity, especially chromosomal toxicity. The efficacy and safety of these compounds as a drug for treating the gastritis and/or stomach ulcer have been measured through animal test. Accordingly, the inventors of present application have prepared bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (B) or bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (C) by cyclizing 10 member ring structure (A) of sesquiterpene lactone, such as, epi-tulipinolide or parthenolide. Further, the inventors of present application have also found that such bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (B) and/or bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (C) show high efficacy as a drug for treating or preventing the gastritis and/or stomach ulcer, while these compounds show very low cytotoxicity, especially chromosomal toxicity. Problem to be Solved The problem to be solved is to develop the bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (B) or the bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (C) by cyclizing 10 member ring structure (A) of sesquiterpene lactone, such as, epi-tulipinolide or parthenolide. Accordingly, it has been found that such bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (B) and/or bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (C) show high efficacy as a drug for treating or preventing the gastritis and/or stomach ulcer, while these compounds show very low cytotoxicity, especially chromosomal toxicity. Means for Solving the Problem The object of present application is to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing sesquiterpene lactone compound represented by formula CD-101 derived from parthenolide for treating or preventing the gastritis and/or stomach ulcer. Further, the ED50 of CD-101 compound shows 1.24±0.1 mg/kg according to HCl-ethanol inducing stomach ulcer model. Further, the ED50 of CD-101 compound shows 2.78±0.1 mg/kg according to indomethacin inducing stomach ulcer model. Further, said CD-101 compound shows neither cytotoxicity nor chromosomal aberration according to chromosomal aberration test using Chinese hamster lung cell. The other object of present application is to provide a process for preparing sesquiterpene lactone compound represented by formula CD-101 comprising the steps of: (1) obtaining the reaction mixture after reacting parthenolide and p-tosylic acid in the presence of methanol solvent, and neutralizing said reaction mixture with disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4); (2) obtaining ethyl acetate layer after separating aqueous layer and ethyl acetate layer by adding ethyl acetate, and drying the solvent in ethyl acetate layer; and (3) isolating and purifying CD-101 compound using column chromatography and HPLC after dissolving dried product in step (2) with eluent. Further, the eluent for column chromatography is mixture of hexane:ethyl acetate (v/v 3:1), while said eluent for HPLC is mixture of water and methanol. Advantageous Effect The outstanding advantageous effect of present application is to afford the bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (B) or the bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (C) by cyclizing 10 member ring structure (A) of sesquiterpene lactone, such as, epi-tulipinolide or parthenolide. Accordingly, such bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (B) and/or bicyclic sesquiterpene lactone compound (C) show high efficacy as a drug for treating or preventing the gastritis and/or stomach ulcer, while these compounds show very low cytotoxicity, especially chromosomal toxicity.

The test material has been dissolved and diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Regardless of metabolic activation system, 12 concentration steps (2.43, 4.87, 9.75, 19.5, 39.1, 78.1, 156.3, 312.5, 625, 1250, 2500, 5000 μg/ml) of test material have been prepared. The cells have been cultured for 24 hours as the same way of main test. In case of using metabolic activation system, the medium has been replaced by normal medium after 6 hour from the treatment of metabolic activator. The medium has been further cultured for 18 hours. Based upon the data of cell growth inhibition test, maximum concentration has been determined when the cell growth has been inhibited up to 50% as the relative cell numbers. The Table 4 shows the concentration of this test. 2: Main Test Regardless of metabolic activation system, the test materials have been prepared after 24 hours from the initiation of test. Then, the number of chromosomal aberration has been counted. In case of direct method without metabolic activation system, the frequency of chromosomal aberration has not meaningfully increased compared to negative control in all reacting concentration. Further, in case of using metabolic activation system, the frequency of chromosomal aberration also has not meaningfully increased compared to negative control in all reacting concentration, according to the treatment of metabolic activator for 6 hours as well as the recovery of treated material for 18 hours (Table 4). It has been confirmed that CD-101, CD-102 and CD-103 compound do not induce the chromosomal aberration as to the CHL cell. However, it has been also confirmed that open 10-member ring germacranolide lactone derivatives induce the chromosomal aberration as to CL cell. From this result, we can find out that 10-member ring germacranolide lactone structure has been changed into bicyclic ring structure not to induce the chromosomal aberration (Table 5).
