Step 8 Synthesis of Compound (I-31)
Compound 18 (17 mg, 0.03 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (1 mL), and triethylamine (0.041 mL, 0.296 mmol) and acetyl chloride (5.27 ÂµL, 0.074 mmol) were added to the solution. The reaction mixture was left standing overnight. Water was added to the residue, followed by extraction with chloroform. Then, the organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was purified by silicagel column chromatography (chloroform-methanol) to give Compound (I-31) (racemate, 15 mg, Yield 87.4%).
