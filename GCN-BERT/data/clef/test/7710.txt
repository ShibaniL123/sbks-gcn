FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to curing devices, and more particularly, to a curing device for use in curing a nail gel. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A gel manicure is a type of nail treatment which involves applying a nail gel to a user's nails, irradiating the nail gel with a light from a curing device, and curing the nail gel. Upon completion of the above gel manicure process, the nails are beautified, and their beauty can last for a long period of time. According to the prior art, the curing device uses an ultra-violet light (UV light) as the light source. Referring to FIG. 1, the curing device 10 comprises a casing 11 and a plurality of UV light lamps 12 disposed inside the casing 11. The nail gel applied to the nails is irradiated with the UV light emitted from the UV light lamps 12 and thus cured. However, due to the limited range of the angle of the irradiation of the UV light lamps 12, not only is the curing of the nail gel uneven, but it is also necessary to extend the duration of the irradiation of the UV light lamps 12 in order for the curing of the nail gel to be complete. Furthermore, another conventional curing device 20 is also commercially available. Referring to FIG. 2, the conventional curing device 20 comprises a casing 21, a plurality of UV light lamps 22 and a plurality of reflection mirrors 23. The UV light lamps 22 are disposed in the casing 21, so are the reflection mirrors 23. After being emitted from the UV light lamps 22, UV light is reflected off the reflection mirrors 23 to fall uniformly on the nail gel, thereby solving a drawback of the prior art—the uneven curing of the nail gel. However, there is still another drawback of the prior art—in the presence of the reflection mirrors 23, the UV light lamps 22 tend to be overheated to the detriment of the service life thereof, not to mention that the user's nails are likely to be scorched. Accordingly, it is imperative to provide a curing device which not only cures the nail gel quickly and evenly but is also effective in heat dissipation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the aforesaid drawbacks of the prior art, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a curing device for curing a nail gel quickly and evenly. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a nail gel curing device effective in heat dissipation. In order to achieve the above and other objectives, the present invention provides a curing device for curing a nail gel. The curing device comprises a body, a motor, at least a vane, and at least a light source assembly. The motor is disposed at the body. The vane is disposed at a shaft of the motor. The light source assembly is disposed at the vane. The motor drives the vane to rotate and drives the light source assembly to rotate synchronously. In an embodiment of the curing device of the present invention, the body is in the form of a rod. In an embodiment of the curing device of the present invention, the body is in the form of a hollow-cored casing, and the motor is disposed inside the hollow-cored casing. In an embodiment of the curing device of the present invention, both the vane and the light source assembly are provided in the plural, and the light source assemblies are disposed at the vanes, respectively. In an embodiment of the curing device of the present invention, the light source assembly comprises a plurality of light emitting diodes (LEDs). Accordingly, the curing device of the present invention is characterized in that: with the vane driving the light source assembly to rotate, the curing device of the present invention cures the nail gel quickly and evenly; and the rotation of the vane speeds up the dissipation of heat generated from the curing device of the present invention.

As shown in the diagrams, the curing device 101 comprises a body 110, a motor 120, at least a vane 130 and at least a light source assembly 140. In the first embodiment, the body 110 is in the form of a rod, such that it is easy for the user to grip the body 110. The motor 120 is disposed at an end of the body 110 (i.e., the rod). An internal battery or an external power source supplies power to the motor 120. An end of the vane 130 is disposed at a shaft of the motor 120. The shaft of the motor 120 rotates to drive the vane 130 to rotate. At least a light source assembly 140 is disposed on a surface of the vane 130. The rotation of the vane 130 causes the rotation of the light source assembly 140, and both occur synchronously. In the first embodiment, to operate the curing device 101, the user follows the steps: apply a nail gel G to a user's nails; the user grips body 110 (i.e., the rod) of the curing device 101 by hand in a manner that the nails with the nail gel G face the vane 130 and the light source assembly 140; the shaft of the motor 120 rotates to drive the vane 130 to rotate and drive the light source assembly 140 to rotate, such that the light emitted the light source assembly 140 falls evenly on the nail gel G of the nails; cure the nail gel G quickly and evenly; the rotation of the vane 130 is accompanied by the generation of an air current in the vicinity of the light source assembly 140 to thereby enhance the heat dissipation of the curing device 101. Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown a front view of a curing device 102 according to the second embodiment of the present invention. Understandably, the second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that both the vane 130 and the light source assembly 140 of the curing device 102 are provided in the plural. As shown in the diagram, both the vane 130 and the light source assembly 140 are in the number of two, and the light source assemblies 140 are disposed at the vanes 130, respectively. Preferably, the vanes 130 are arranged in a symmetrical pattern, such that the vanes 130 are unlikely to shake while rotating. Understandably, it is feasible that the vanes 130 of the curing device of the present invention 102 are provided, as needed, in the number of two, three, four or eight, so as to enhance the heat dissipation of the curing device 102. Furthermore, it is feasible that the light source assemblies 140 of the curing device of the present invention 102 are provided, as needed, in the number greater than two, such that the light source assemblies 140 emit, more often and more, light rays to irradiate the nail gel G on the user's nails to speed up the curing of the nail gel G. Referring to FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, there are shown in FIG. 7 a perspective view of a curing device 103 according to the third embodiment of the present invention, and in FIG. 8 a schematic view of the curing device 103 in operation according to the third embodiment of the present invention. Understandably, the third embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that the curing device 103 is characterized in that the body 110 is in the form of a hollow-cored casing, whereas the motor 120 is disposed on the inner sidewall of the body 110 (i.e., the hollow-cored casing), such that the curing device 103 of the present invention is hands-free and thus features ease of use. In the third embodiment, to operate the curing device 103, the user follows the steps: apply a nail gel G to a user's nails; the user puts his or her hands into the body 110 (i.e., the hollow-cored casing) of the curing device 103 in a manner that the nails with the nail gel G face the vane 120 and the light source assembly 140; the shaft of the motor 120 rotates to drive the vane 130 to rotate and drive the light source assembly 140 to rotate, such that the light emitted from the light source assembly 140 falls evenly on the nail gel G of the nails; cure the nail gel G quickly and evenly; the rotation of the vane 130 is accompanied by the generation of an air current in the vicinity of the light source assembly 140 to thereby enhance the heat dissipation of the curing device 103. Furthermore, the light source assembly 140 of the curing devices 101, 102, 103 comprises preferably a plurality of light emitting diodes (LEDs). When compared with conventional UV light lamps, LEDs not only operate at low temperature and thus safely, but also speed up the curing of the nail gel because of the specific wavelength of the light emitted from the LEDs, thereby allowing the curing devices 101, 102, 103 to cure the nail gel G quickly and safely. In conclusion, the curing devices of the present invention are characterized in that: a vane drives a light source assembly to rotate, and thus the curing of a nail gel is quick and uniform; rotation of the vane speeds up the dissipation of heat generated from the curing devices of the present invention.
