This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/262,840, filed Apr. 28, 2014. This prior application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a process for killing spores, and to an aqueous composition containing an antimicrobial agent (e.g., peracetic acid) and a peroxide (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) for use in the process for killing spores. BACKGROUND Spores are a highly resistant, dormant cell type formed by some types of bacteria. Endospores (or simply spores) form within the vegetative mother cell in response to adverse changes in the environment, most commonly nutrient depletion. The mother cell undergoes an asymmetrical cell division, where it replicates its genetic material, which is then surrounded by multiple concentric and spore specific layers. The mother cell then disintegrates, releasing the mature dormant spore which requires neither nutrients, water nor air for survival and is protected against a variety of trauma, including extremes of temperature, radiation, and chemical assault. Spore forming bacteria cause a number of serious diseases in humans, including botulism, gas gangrene, tetanus, and acute food poisoning. Anthrax results from infection by the aerobic spore form Bacillus anthracis. SUMMARY Spores are difficult to kill and a problem in the art of sterilization relates to providing an effective process for killing spores. This invention provides a solution to this problem. This invention relates to a process for killing spores and to an aqueous composition for use in the process. The aqueous composition may comprise water, an antimicrobial agent (e.g., peracetic acid) and a peroxide (e.g., hydrogen peroxide). The process may comprise contacting the spores with the aqueous composition to kill the spores. Alternatively, the process may comprise a two-step process that employs a first aqueous composition comprising water and the peroxide, and a second aqueous composition comprising water and the antimicrobial agent, the process comprising contacting the spores with these aqueous compositions to kill the spores. With this alternative the spores may be contacted with the first and second aqueous compositions either simultaneously or sequentially.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a bacterial spore that can be killed in accordance with the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION All ranges and ratio limits disclosed in the specification and claims may be combined in any manner. It is to be understood that unless specifically stated otherwise, references to “a,” “an,” and/or “the” may include one or more than one, and that reference to an item in the singular may also include the item in the plural. The phrase “and/or” should be understood to mean “either or both” of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the “and/or” clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified unless clearly indicated to the contrary. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to “A and/or B,” when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as “comprising” can refer, in one embodiment, to A without B (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B without A (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc. The word “or” should be understood to have the same meaning as “and/or” as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list, “or” or “and/or” shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as “only one of” or “exactly one of,” may refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general, the term “or” as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. “one or the other but not both”) when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as “either,” “one of,” “only one of,” or “exactly one of.” The phrase “at least one,” in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase “at least one” refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, “at least one of A and B” (or, equivalently, “at least one of A or B,” or, equivalently “at least one of A and/or B”) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc. The transitional words or phrases, such as “comprising,” “including,” “carrying,” “having,” “containing,” “involving,” “holding,” and the like, are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. The term “killing” (or “kill”) spores refers to rendering the spores incapable of returning to vegetative growth. In an embodiment, the term killing spores refers to rendering the spores incapable of reproduction, metabolism and/or growth. The term “log reduction” is a mathematical term to show the number of live spores killed by contacting the spores with the aqueous composition of the invention. A “4 log reduction” means that the number of live spores is 10,000 times smaller. A “5 log reduction” means that the number of live spores is 100,000 times smaller. A “6 log reduction” means that the number of live spores is 1,000,000 times smaller. The term “antimicrobial agent” refers to a substance that kills microorganisms or inhibits their growth. The term “disinfectant” refers to a substance that is applied to non-living objects to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that are on the objects. The term “antibiotic” refers to a substance that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms within the body. The term “antiseptic” refers to a substance that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms on living tissue. The term “biocide” refers to a substance that kills or inhibits the growth of living organisms. The biocide can be a pesticide. The biocide can be a fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, algaecide, molluscicide, miticide or rodenticide. The term “sanitizer” refers to a substance that cleans and disinfects. The sterilization of spores is often taken as referring to a process for achieving a total absence of living spores. Processes that are less rigorous than sterilization may include, for example, disinfection, sanitization, decontamination, cleaning, and the like. The aqueous compositions and processes provided for herein may be used to achieve at least a 4 log reduction, or at least a 5 log reduction, or at least a 6 log reduction in the number of spores capable of returning to vegetative growth, or in an embodiment, capable of reproduction, metabolism and/or growth. When at least a 6 log reduction is achieved, the process may be referred to as a sterilization process. When a 4 log reduction or a 5 log reduction is achieved, the process may be considered to be less rigorous than a sterilization, but nevertheless useful for various disinfection, sanitization, decontamination and/or cleaning applications. Bacterial spores typically comprise multiple concentric layers surrounding a central core. This is illustrated in FIG. 1 wherein a bacterial spore is shown which has a central core, inner membrane, germ cell wall, cortex, outer membrane, spore coat and occasionally an exosporium. Oxidizing agents for years have been thought to attack DNA, RNA, protein and most organic matter equally. However, while not wishing to be bound by theory, with the present invention it is believed that the mechanism that is provided involves the peroxide (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) first piercing holes in multiple layers surrounding the central core of the spores, and then the antimicrobial agent advancing through the pierced holes and attacking the central core to kill the spores. This mechanism is believed to occur when using aqueous compositions with relatively low concentrations of the peroxide (e.g., in the range from about 0.01 to about 7% by weight) and the antimicrobial agent (e.g., in the range from about 0.001 to about 0.5% by weight). In an embodiment, this mechanism is believed to occur when relatively low concentrations of the antimicrobial agent and peroxide are used, as indicated above, and the antimicrobial agent to peroxide weight ratio is relatively low (e.g., in the range from about 0.001 to about 0.5). Hence, in this embodiment, the ratio of antimicrobial agent to peroxide is important with respect to biocidal potentials. In embodiments wherein the concentrations of the antimicrobial agent and peroxide are relatively low, as indicated above, advantages of the inventive process include relatively low costs due to the fact that the concentrations of the antimicrobial agent and peroxide used in the process are relatively low in comparison to normal concentrations used in other products using these ingredients. Other advantages of these embodiments include low levels of corrosion of surfaces treated due to the low concentrations of the antimicrobial agent and peroxide. In an embodiment, higher concentrations of the antimicrobial agent, for example concentrations of antimicrobial agent of up to about 95% by weight, or up to about 60% by weight, and the peroxide, for example concentrations of up to about 14% by weight, may be used advantageously when the aqueous composition is applied to spores which are on a substrate. In this embodiment, some of the antimicrobial agent and peroxide may be absorbed and/or neutralized by the substrate. As a result, higher concentrations of the antimicrobial agent and peroxide may be required to kill the spores that are on the substrate. With this embodiment, it is believed that the above-indicated mechanism still applies, but the concentrations of antimicrobial agent and peroxide are increased to account for the fact that when applied to a substrate some of the antimicrobial agent and/or peroxide may be absorbed and/or neutralized by the substrate. The water may comprise tap water, deionized water, distilled water, water purified by osmosis, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The peroxide may comprise any compound containing an oxygen-oxygen single bond, or a peroxide group or peroxide ion. Examples include hydrogen peroxide; organic peroxides (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, acetyl acetone peroxide, acetyl benzoyl peroxide, diacetyl peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, methyl isobutyl ketone peroxide, acetone peroxide, or a mixture of two or more thereof); peroxy acids (e.g., peroxy carboxylic acid); organic hydroperoxides (e.g., t-butyl hydroperoxide, ethylhydroperoxide, or cumene hydroperoxide); inorganic peroxides such as peroxide salts (e.g., alkali metal or alkaline earth metal peroxides); acid peroxides (e.g., peroxymonosulfuric acid or peroxydisulfuric acid); and mixtures of two or more thereof. The hydrogen peroxide may be derived from any source of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is typically available as a solution in water. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations of about 3 to about 8% by weight may be used. Commercial grades of about 30% to about 40% by weight, or about 35% by weight, hydrogen peroxide may be used. Commercial grades of about 70 to about 98% by weight hydrogen peroxide may be used. The higher concentrations would be diluted to provide the desired concentrations of hydrogen peroxide that are indicated above. The antimicrobial agent may comprise a disinfectant, antibiotic, antiseptic, biocide and/or sanitizer. The antimicrobial agent may comprise peracetic acid. The antimicrobial agent may comprise an alcohol, chlorine, a chlorine compound, an aldehyde, an oxidizing agent, iodine, ozone, a phenolic, a quaternary ammonium compound, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The antimicrobial agent may comprise formaldehyde, ortho-phthalaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, silver dihydrogen citrate, polyaminopropyl biguanide, sodium bicarbonate, lactic acid, chlorine bleach, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The antimicrobial agent may comprise methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, isopropanol, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The antimicrobial agent may comprise a hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, a dichloroisocyanurate, a monochloroisocyanurate, a halogenated hydantoin, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The antimicrobial agent may comprise sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, sodium chlorite, N-chloro-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide sodium salt, 2,4-dichorobenzyl alcohol, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The antimicrobial agent may comprise performic acid, potassium permanganate, potassium peroxymonosulfate, or a mixture of two or more thereof.

Many of these antimicrobial agents may not be effective in the killing of spores on their own, but when combined with hydrogen peroxide at the concentration levels indicated above many of these antimicrobial agents are useful for killing spores. The aqueous composition (or second aqueous composition when using a two-step process) may further comprise acetic acid, sulfuric acid, or a mixture thereof. The concentration of acetic acid may range up to about 60% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 60% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 30% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 10% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 5% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 2% by weight.

EXAMPLES The efficacy of the inventive process is assessed using a time kill suspension test method and spores of Bacillus subtilis. Peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are prepared as concentrated stocks (3× concentrate). Each test contains 100 μl of the PAA concentrate and 100 μl of the H2O2 concentrate. Controls containing only PAA or H2O2 are also prepared. These contain 100 μl of either the PAA concentrate or H2O2 concentrate and 100 μl of de-ionized water. To each test, 100 μl of spores are added while starting the timer concurrently. The samples are mixed thoroughly. The temperature of the samples is room temperature. At the appropriate contact times, 10 μl of the appropriate test sample are placed into 90 μl of the appropriate neutralizing solution, mixed thoroughly and incubated for at least 10 minutes. Ten fold serial dilutions are prepared through 10−6 and plated using the drop counting method. The plates are then incubated aerobically at 37° C. for 1-2 days. Following incubation, colony forming units (CFU) are counted using standard plate count techniques and converted to log 10 values for analysis. The results are indicated in the tables below.

For PAA concentrations 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04% (in the absence of H2O2), the values shown are extrapolated based on the experimental data obtained for PAA concentrations 0.08, 0.16 and 0.32%. Similarly, for H2O2 concentrations 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4% (in the absence of PAA), the values shown are extrapolated from experimental data. All other values are generated from spore kill data. Table 2 illustrates the potentiation of spore killing by PAA when in the presence of H2O2. At higher PAA concentrations (0.08 and 0.16% PAA) relatively little activity is gained by the addition of even very high concentrations of H2O2. For example, 0.16% PAA is only 3.41 times more active in the presence of 6.4% H2O2, as compared to the activity of 0.16% PAA alone. However, as the concentration of PAA is reduced, the effect of adding H2O2 becomes more dramatic, with PAA spore killing activity being hundreds, thousands and even tens of thousands of times greater when in the presence of low concentrations of H2O2. For example, 0.02% PAA is 333.11 times more active in combination with 0.8% H2O2 than when used alone. Table 3 illustrates the potentiation of spore killing by H2O2 when in the presence of PAA. The enhancement of the spore killing activity of H2O2 when in the presence of PAA is far less pronounced, with relative improvement in the spore killing activity of H2O2 in combination with all but the highest concentrations of PAA being no greater than about 100 times.
