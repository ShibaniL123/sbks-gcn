It may be desirable for reasons of economics or of rubber technology to minimize the necessary or desirable proportion of further silanes. The amounts used of the rubber auxiliaries may be conventionally known amounts, depending inter alia on the intended purpose. As a function of the processing aid used, conventional amounts may be amounts of from 0.001 to 50% by weight, preferably from 0.001 to 30% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.01 to 30% by weight, very particularly preferably from 0.1 to 30% by weight, based on rubber (phr). The rubber mixtures of the invention may be sulfur-vulcanizable rubber mixtures. The rubber mixtures of the invention may be peroxidically crosslinkable rubber mixtures. Crosslinking agents that may be used are sulfur or sulfur-donor substances. The amount of sulfur can be from 0.1 to 10% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on the rubber. The azocarbonyl-functionalized silanes of formula I may be used as adhesion promoter between inorganic materials (e.g. glass beads, glass splinters, glass surfaces, glass fibers, metals, oxidic fillers, silicas) and organic polymers (e.g. thermosets, thermoplastics, elastomers), or as crosslinking agent and surface modifier for oxidic surfaces. The azocarbonyl-functionalized silanes of formula I may be used as coupling reagents in filled rubber mixtures, such as seals.

The invention further provides a process for the production of the rubber mixtures of the invention, which comprises mixing at least one rubber selected from the group of ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer (EPDM), ethylene-propylene copolymer (EPM), chloroprene rubber (CR), chloropolyethylene (CM), chloro-isobutene-isoprene (chlorobutyl) rubber (CIIR), chlorosulfonyl polyethylene (CSM), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EAM), alkyl acrylate copolymer (ACM), polyester polyurethane (AU), polyether polyurethane (EU), bromo-isobutene-isoprene (bromobutyl)rubber (BIIR), polychlorotrifluoroethylene (CFM), isobutene-isoprene rubber (butyl rubber, IIR), isobutene rubber (IM), polyisoprene (IR), thermoplastic polyester polyurethane (YAU), thermoplastic polyether polyurethane (YEU), silicone rubber with methyl groups on the polymer chain (MQ), hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (HNBR), acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) or carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (XNBR), preferably ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer (EPDM), at least one oxidic filler, and at least one silicon containing azocarbonyl-functionalized silane of formula I. The process for the production of the rubber mixtures of the invention may be conducted at temperatures greater than 25° C., including from 80° C. to 220° C., preferably from 100° C. to 200° C., particularly preferably from 110° C. to 180° C. and may be conducted continuously or batchwise. The addition of the silicon containing azocarbonyl-functionalized silanes of formula I, and also the addition of the fillers, may take place when the temperatures of the composition are from 100 to 220° C. However, it may also take place at lower temperatures of from 40 to 100° C., e.g. together with further rubber auxiliaries. The blending of the rubbers with the filler and, optionally, with rubber auxiliaries and with the azocarbonyl-functionalized silanes of the general formula I may take place in or on conventional mixing assemblies, such as rolls, internal mixers, and mixing extruders. These rubber mixtures may usually be produced in internal mixers, beginning with one or more successive thermomechanical mixing stages in which the rubbers, the filler, the silicon containing azocarbonyl-functionalized silanes of formula I and the rubber auxiliaries are incorporated by mixing at from 100 to 180° C. The sequence of addition and the juncture of addition of the individual components here may have a decisive effect on the resultant properties of the mixture. The crosslinking chemicals may usually be admixed in an internal mixer or on a roll at from 40 to 110° C. with the rubber mixture thus obtained, and processed to give what is known as a crude mixture for the subsequent steps of the process, for example shaping and vulcanization. Vulcanization of the rubber mixtures of the invention may take place at temperatures of from 80 to 220° C., preferably from 130 to 190° C., if appropriate under a pressure of from 10 to 200 bar. The rubber mixtures of the invention may be used for the production of seals, vibrators, glass-run channels, radiators, garden and appliance hoses, tubings, washers, belts, electrical insulations, and speaker cone surrounds, in electrical cable-jointings, profiles, outer casing on wires, roofing membranes, geomembranes, rubber mechanical goods, plastic impact modifications, thermoplastic, vulcanizates and many other applications.

Wehmeier; Degree thesis 1998 at the Technical University of Münster, Steinfurt site, Chemical Engineering Department, and Filler dispersion Analysis by Topography Measurements Degussa AG, Applied Technology Advanced Fillers, Technical Report TR 820. As an alternative, the dispersion coefficient can also be determined by the DIAS method (optically) at the Deutsches Institut für Kautschuktechnologie in Hanover, Germany (see H. Geisler, DIK aktuell, 1st edition (1997) and Medalia, Rubber Age, April 1965). The best degree of dispersion achievable is 100%, and accordingly the worst will theoretically be 0%. Silicas whose dispersion coefficient is greater or equal to 90% are regarded as highly dispersible (HD).
