190.4: 5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one
297 mg (0.3 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and then 4 g (25.7 mmol) of 2,3-difluorophenylboronic acid are added to a solution of 1.6 g (5.1 mmol) of 5-bromo-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one and 12.9 mL (25.7 mmol) of an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate of concentration 2M in 48 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide and 16 mL of water, previously degassed. The reaction mixture is heated at 90Â° C. for 1.5 h. After cooling, the reaction mixture is hydrolysed and then diluted with ethyl acetate. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are combined, washed once with water and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a heptane/ethyl acetate mixture 80/20 to give 0.7 g (41%) of 5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one in the form of a yellow oil.
