STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST [0002] This invention was made with government support under HR0011-13-2-0018 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and CA151880 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention. SEQUENCE LISTING [0003] This application contains, as a separate part of the disclosure, a Sequence Listing in computer readable form (filename: 2013-201_SeqListing.txt; Created: December 3, 2014; 1,893 bytes), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0004] The present disclosure relates to liposomal particles, methods of making the same, and uses thereof. Liposomal particles are useful in gene regulation and drug delivery. BACKGROUND [0005] Chemistry has been explored to create liposomes and small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). For example, Vogel et al, "DNA Controlled Assembly of Lipid Membranes," U.S. Patent Publication Number 2010/0144848, discloses that DNA modified with two lipophilic anchors can form liposomes or SUVs. This post modification technique does not favor high surface density modification. [0006] Hook et el., "Oligonucleotides Related to Lipid Membrane Attachment," U.S. Patent Publication Number 2013/0252852 describes liposomes or SUVs created having an oligonucleotide having a first strand and a second strand of nucleic acid and two or more hydrophobic anchoring moieties located in its terminal ends, wherein the hydrophobic anchoring moieties are found in the bilayer. Since two cholesterol molecules are used to anchor a molecule into the lipid bilayer, this post modification technique does not favor high surface density modification. [0007] Lu et al., "Amphiphilic Substances and Functionalized Lipid Vesicles Including the Same," U.S. Patent Publication Number 2010/0166842 describes liposomes or SUVs comprising at least two nucleotide segments hybridized with each other. This non-post modification technique based vesicle is less efficient in stabilizing vesicles since it incorporates stabilizing moieties on both sides of the lipid bilayer. [0008] Non-patent literature also reveals chemistry to create liposomes and SUVs, but each of these chemistries has its issues too. For example, "Liposome- Anchored Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Aptamers" Bioconjugate Chem., 1998, 9, 573-582, describes the synthesis of aptamer DNA-functionalized liposomes and their application toward selective cancer cell targeting. The liposomes created by this method averaged 80 nanometers in size, had aptamer DNA molecules on both sides of the bilipid layer, and did not demonstrate gene regulation. [0009] "Reversible Cell-Specific Drug Delivery with Aptamer-Functionalized Liposomes" Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2009, 48, 6494-6498, describes the synthesis of aptamer DNA- functionalized liposomes and their application toward selective cancer cell targeting and drug delivery. The liposomes created by this method averaged between 140 nanometers and 200 nanometers, utilize a cholesterol unit to anchor DNA into the lipid bilayer, comprise apatamer DNA molecules on both sides of the bilipid layer, and did not exhibit gene regulation. [0010] "Selective delivery of an anticancer drug with aptamer-functionalized liposomes to breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo" J. Mater. Chem. B, 2013, 1, 5288, discloses the synthesis of aptamer DNA-functionalized liposomes and their application toward selective cancer cell targeting and drug delivery. This work is an extension of the research disclosed in "Reversible Cell-Specific Drug Delivery with Aptamer-Functionalized Liposomes" above. Like before, these particles utilize a cholesterol unit to anchor DNA into the lipid bilayer, comprise aptamer DNA molecules on both sides of the bilipid layer, and did not exhibit gene regulation. [0011] The research in "Phospholipid Membranes Decorated by Cholesterol-Based Oligonucleotides as Soft Hybrid Nanostructures" /. Phys. Chem. B, 2008, 112, 10942-10952, characterizes cholesterol DNA-functionalized liposomes. In this report, liposomes of 33 to 35 nm in size were prepared from l-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipid and post functionalized with cholesterol modified DNA molecule. This report does not demonstrate gene regulation, and these particles utilize a cholesterol unit to anchor DNA into the lipid bilayer. [0012] "Bivalent Cholesterol-Based Coupling of Oligonucleotides to Lipid Membrane Assemblies" J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 10224-10225, describes the development of partially duplexed DNA strand containing two cholesterol units for anchoring into the lipid bilayer. The use of two cholesterol units to anchor a DNA strand into the lipid bilayer results in decreased surface density of oligonucleotides associated with the liposome. [0013] In "Quantification of Oligonucleotide Modifications of Small Unilamellar Lipid Vesicles" Anal. Chem. 2006, 78, 7493-7498, the researchers describe the development of a technique for the quantification of DNA strands on a functionalized liposomal nanoparticle. The particle described comprises a partially duplexed DNA strand containing two cholesterol units for anchoring into the lipid bilayer. The use of two cholesterol units to anchor a DNA strand into the lipid bilayer results in decreased surface density of oligonucleotides associated with the liposome. [0014] "Single-Molecule Detection and Mismatch Discrimination of Unlabeled DNA Targets" Nano Lett. 2008, 8, 183-188, discloseslOO nanometer sized liposomes functionalized with partially duplexed DNA strand containing two cholesterol units. This work is an extension of the research disclosed in "Bivalent Cholesterol-Based Coupling of Oligonucleotides to Lipid Membrane Assemblies" and "Quantification of Oligonucleotide Modifications of Small Unilamellar Lipid Vesicles" above. Like before, these particles comprise a partially duplexed DNA strand containing two cholesterol units for anchoring into the lipid bilayer. The use of the two cholesterol units to anchor a DNA strand into the lipid bilayer results in decreased surface density of oligonucleotides associated with the liposome. [0015] "DNA-Induced Programmable Fusion of Phospholipid Vesicles" J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 9584-9585, is an analytical paper on the fusion of cholesterol DNA-functionalized liposomal nanoparticles. The vesicles utilized in this paper were at least 100 nanometers in size. [0016] "Determinants for Membrane Fusion Induced by Cholesterol-Modified DNA Zippers" J. Phys. Chem. B, 2008, 112, 8264-8274, is an analytical paper on fusion of cholesterol DNA- functionalized liposomal nanoparticle, and is a continuation of the work from "DNA-Induced Programmable Fusion of Phospholipid Vesicles" described above. This paper combines sequence specific fusion with the utilization of a partially duplexed DNA strand containing two cholesterol units to anchor the oligonucleotide into the lipid bilayer (e.g., the partially duplexed DNA strand found in "Quantification of Oligonucleotide Modifications of Small Unilamellar Lipid Vesicles" above). [0017] "Liposome-Based Chemical barcodes for Single Molecule DNA Detection Using Imaging Mass Spectrometry" Nano Lett, 2010, 10, 732-737, is an analytical paper on detection of specific DNA targets depending on the DNA sequence. This is an extension of the work from the same group that reported "DNA-Induced Programmable Fusion of Phospholipid Vesicles" that combines sequence specific fusion with different DNA anchoring (using bischolesteryl anchor, see: Anal. Chem. 2006, 78, 7493-7498). [0018] "Programmable Assembly of DNA-Functionalized Liposomes by DNA" is an analytical paper that discloses the assembly of cholesterol DNA functionalized liposomes. In this report, liposomes with a hydrodynamic diameter of 114 and 251 nm were synthesized and post synthetically functionalized with cholesterol modified DNA molecules. The particles in this report utilize cholesterol anchoring of the oligonucleotide molecule into the lipid bilayer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0019] Liposomes are spherical, self-closed structures in a varying size range consisting of one or several hydrophobic lipid bilayers with a hydrophilic core. The diameter of these lipid based carriers range from 0.15-1 micrometers, which is significantly higher than an effective therapeutic range of 20-100 nanometers. Liposomes termed small unilamellar vesicles (SUV), can be synthesized in the 20-50 nanometer size range, but encounter challenges such as instability and aggregation leading to inter-particle fusion. This inter-particle fusion limits the use of SUVs in therapeutics. [0020] To combat this instability, SUVs can be functionalized with polymers, peptides, DNA, and other molecules of interest by two distinct techniques. In a first approach, a modified molecule of interest is added to the mixture of lipids, lipid film or hydration buffer during the synthesis of liposome. This approach results in a liposomes containing a functional molecule of interest on both inner and outer layers of the liposomal membrane. Generally speaking, structures created by this method are not stable at a size smaller than 80 nanometers (nm). In an alternative approach, a SUV may be made by anchoring a substrate of interest into the lipid bilayer of the preformed vesicle (a "post modification technique"). This alternative approach yields a liposomal nanoparticle containing a functional molecule of interest on the outer layer of the liposomal membrane. Importantly, this alternative post modification approach allows the creation of liposome of any size, even less than 50 nanometers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0063] Spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanoparticle conjugates are structures typically synthesized from inorganic nanoparticle templates and shells of highly oriented nucleic acid ligands immobilized on the surface of such particles [Mirkin et al., Nature 382: 607 (1996)]. SNAs have been prepared in a variety of different forms [Cutler et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 134: 1376 (2012); Will et al., In Nanomaterials for Biomedicine; American Chemical Society: Vol. 1119, p 1-20 (2012)]. Core compositions, including gold, silica [Young et al., Nano Lett. 12: 3867 (2012)], iron oxide [Cutler et al., Nano Lett. 10: 1477 (2010); Zhang et al., Nat. Mater. 12: 741 (2013)], and Ag [Lee et al., Nano Lett. 7: 2112 (2007)] with shell compositions consisting of DNA, RNA, LNA [Seferos et al., ChemBioChem 8: 1230 (2007)], and PNA [Lytton-Jean et al., Advanced Materials 21: 706 (2009)] have all been prepared and explored. Hollow SNA structures consisting of cross-linked oligonucleotide [Cutler et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133: 9254 (2011)] have been synthesized along with micelle-block copolymer structures [Li et al., Nano Lett. 4: 1055 (2004); Alemdaroglu et al., Advanced Materials 20: 899 (2008); Liu et al., Chemistry - A European Journal 16: 3791 (2010); Chien et al., Chem. Commun. 47: 167 (2011)]. Although there is now a tremendous structural and compositional diversity among the known SNAs, they all share some common properties and features. Their polyvalent architectures allow them to cooperatively bind oligonucleotides and form duplex structures that exhibit very narrow melting transitions. These properties have been exploited in the development of high sensitivity and high selectivity genomic detection systems [Rosi et al., Chem. Rev. 105: 1547 (2005)]. While linear nucleic acids do not enter cells well without polymer, peptide, or viral transfection agents, the three-dimensional SNA structure is recognized by class A scavenger receptors [Patel et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 21: 2250 (2010); Choi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110: 7625 (2013)] and is rapidly taken into over 60 different cell types without the need for an ancillary transfection agent [McAllister et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124: 15198 (2002); Whitehead et al., Nat Rev Drug Discov 8: 129 (2009); Zhang et al., Biomaterials 31: 1805 (2010)]. This property has made such structures important elements in strategies for both intracellular detection [Zheng et al., Nano Lett. 9: 3258 (2009); Prigodich et al., ACS Nano 3: 2147 (2009)] and gene regulation via antisense or siRNA pathways [Rosi et al., Science 312: 1027 (2006); Agbasi-Porter et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 17: 1178 (2006); Giljohann et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 131: 2072 (2009); Jensen et al., Science Translational Medicine 5: 209ral52 (2013)]. [0064] The barrier to therapeutic use is high, however, especially when such structures are made from materials that have known problems with clearance or unknown biodistribution characteristics. Ideally, one would like an SNA structure that is made from readily available starting materials, can be synthesized at scale, and consists of components that have been a part of FDA approved pharmaceuticals [Cutler et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 134: 1376 (2012); Farokhzad et al., Drug Delivery Rev. 58: 1456 (2006)]. Herein, a strategy for making such structures is provided, which consist of small liposomal cores stabilized with a dense shell of a charged polymer with a hydrophobic tail that can intercalate between the phospholipids that define the liposome structure. One such charged polymer contemplated for use is a nucleic acid. As with conventional SNAs, these liposomal structures rapidly enter multiple cell lines and are used in some embodiments to effectively knockdown gene expression via antisense pathways. Conventional SNAs have been shown to enter cells derived from many organs and tissues, including Breast (SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, AU-565), Brain (U87, LN229, U118), Bladder (HT- 1376, 5637, T24), Colon (LS513), Cervix (HeLa, SiHa), Skin (C166, KB, MCF 10A), Kidney (MDCK), Brain (Rat Hippocampus Neurons, Astrocytes, Glial Cells), Bladder, Blood (PBMC, T-cells), Pancreas (Human ฮฒ-Islets), Skin (Human), Blood (Sup Tl, Jurkat), Leukemia (K562), Liver (HepG2), Kidney (293T), Ovary (CHO), Fibroblast (NIH3T3), Macrophage (RAW264.7). The spherical nucleic acid architecture facilitates the entry of these constructs into cells by binding to scavenger receptor A, a cell-membrane receptor. A few non-limiting examples of cell lines which express this receptor are HeLa, SKOV-3, U87, Neuro 2A, RAW cells, HepG2, Hep3B, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, C8S, C166 Bend3, A549, Rab9, HeyA8, Jurkat cells. [0065] The major drawback of employment of SUVs is their inherent instability in solution due to high propensity to fuse into bigger liposomal structures. It is disclosed herein that functionalization of these structures with a dense layer of negatively charged DNA increases their stability by, e.g., decreasing particle-particle interaction due to the repulsion of the negatively charged particle surfaces. In the course of the studies described herein, it was found that tocopherol functionalized DNA provides higher density of DNA strands on the particle compared to other known hydrophobic DNA analogues, significantly increasing stability of the particle. In addition to the general colloidal stability, high density of the DNA will increase the uptake of this nanoparticle via a scavenger receptor B pathway and will allow efficient delivery of the genetic material into a cell. Finally, the dense layer of DNA is expected to increase particle stability in a body, its circulation rate, and therefore improve bio distribution of this nanomedicine. [0066] The present disclosure teaches that by increasing the surface negative charge of SUVs, via the attachment of anionic entities including, but not limited to, DNA and RNA, the colloidal stability of these vesicles is increased. Additionally, the dense spherical arrangement and radial orientation of nucleic acids exhibits unique chemical and biological properties, unlike their linear counterparts. These spherical nucleic acids (SNA) are non-toxic and though anionic, can efficiently enter cells without the aid of ancillary cationic transfection agents in a non- immunogenic fashion. These exceptional properties allow their use as delivery agents for gene regulation in different therapies. The liposome-template mediated synthesis of SNAs provides an alternative platform to metal core SNAs which limits SNAs therapeutic diversity with bioaccumulation of the metal core and inability to encapsulate therapeutic entities. [0067] Tocopherol modified oligonucleotides and methods of making such oligonucleotides, liposomal particles and methods of making same, and uses of liposomal particles now will be described more fully hereinafter. Indeed, the disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. These embodiments are provided in sufficient written detail to describe and enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, along with disclosure of the best mode for practicing the invention, as defined by the claims and equivalents thereof. [0068] Likewise, many modifications and other embodiments of the methods described herein will come to mind to one of skill in the art to which the invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. Terminology [0069] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which the invention pertains. Although any methods and materials similar to or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the preferred methods and materials are described herein. [0070] Certain terms are first defined. Additional terms are defined throughout the specification. [0071] For the sake of brevity, a description of an embodiment of the disclosure in terms of a small unilamellar vesicle (SUV), a liposomal SNA (LSNA), a liposomal particle, or a spherical nucleic acid (SNA) may also be applicable to an embodiment that uses any of the other foregoing terms. By way of example, a method of regulating gene expression using a liposomal SNA may also be described herein as a method of regulating gene expression using a liposomal particle. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are liposomal particles of sub- 100 nanometer size and are used as the precursors to LSNAs. SUVs and LSNAs, as such, can be considered subclasses of liposomal particles. [0072] Terms used herein are intended as "open" terms (for example, the term "including" should be interpreted as "including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited to"). [0073] Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B and C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense of one having ordinary skill in the art would understand the convention (for example, "a system having at least one of A, B and C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description or figures, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase "A or B" will be understood to include the possibilities of "A or B" or "A and B." [0074] All language such as "from," "to," "up to," "at least," "greater than," "less than," and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can subsequently be broken down into sub-ranges as discussed above. [0075] A range includes each individual member. Thus, for example, a group having 1-3 members refers to groups having 1, 2, or 3 members. Similarly, a group having 6 members refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 members, and so forth. [0076] The modal verb "may" refers to the preferred use or selection of one or more options or choices among the several described embodiments or features contained within the same. Where no options or choices are disclosed regarding a particular embodiment or feature contained in the same, the modal verb "may" refers to an affirmative act regarding how to make or use an aspect of a described embodiment or feature contained in the same, or a definitive decision to use a specific skill regarding a described embodiment or feature contained in the same. In this latter context, the modal verb "may" has the same meaning and connotation as the auxiliary verb "can." [0077] As used herein, the articles "a" and "an" refer to one or to more than one (for example, to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. [0078] "About" and "approximately" shall generally mean an acceptable degree of error for the quantity measured given the nature or precision of the measurements. Exemplary degrees of error are within 20-25 percent ( ), typically, within 10%, and more typically, within 5% of a given value or range of values. [0079] The chemical structures described herein are named according to IUPAC nomenclature rules and include art-accepted common names and abbreviations where appropriate. The IUPAC nomenclature can be derived with chemical structure drawing software programs, such as ChemDrawยฎ (PerkinElmer, Inc.), ChemDoodleยฎ (iChemLabs, LLC) and Marvin (ChemAxon Ltd.). The chemical structure controls in the disclosure to the extent that an IUPAC name is misnamed or otherwise conflicts with the chemical structure disclosed herein. [0080] Headings, for example, (A), (B), (i) etc., are presented merely for ease of reading the specification and claims. The use of headings in the specification or claims does not require the steps or elements be performed in alphabetical or numerical order or the order in which they are presented. [0081] The present disclosure describes novel particles, termed liposomal particles, methods of making the same, and uses of these particles. The present liposomal particles are advantageous over other known liposomal based materials in that they are stable at a particle size that is smaller than other known liposomal particles, and the dense layer of DNA increases particle stability in a body, and therefore increases the circulation rate of liposomal vesicles, which improves bio-distribution of these particles inside the body. A. Tocopherol Modified Oligonucleotides [0082] In a first embodiment, an architecture comprising a tocopherol modified oligonucleotide is disclosed. A tocopherol-modified oligonucleotide comprises a lipophilic end and a non-lipophilic end. The lipophilic end comprises tocopherol, and may be chosen from the group consisting of a tocopherol derivative, alpha-tocopherol, beta-tocopherol, gamma- tocopherol and delta-tocopherol. The lipophilic end, in further embodiments, comprises palmitoyl, dipalmitoyl, stearyl, or distearyl. [0083] The non-lipophilic end of the tocopherol-modified oligonucleotide is an oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide is either RNA or DNA. The RNA can be an inhibitory RNA (RNAi) that performs a regulatory function, and is chosen from the group consisting of a small RNAi that is selected from the group consisting of a small inhibitory RNA (siRNA), an RNA that forms a triplex with double stranded DNA, and a ribozyme. Alternatively, the RNA is microRNA that performs a regulatory function. In still further embodiments, the RNA is a piwi- interacting RNA (piRNA). The DNA is, in some embodiments, an antisense-DNA. [0084] Oligonucleotides contemplated for use according to the disclosure are from about 5 to about 100 nucleotides in length.

Modified Oligonucleotides [0085] Specific examples of oligonucleotides include those containing modified backbones or non-natural internucleoside linkages. Oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. Modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone are considered to be within the meaning of "oligonucleotide." [0086] Modified oligonucleotide backbones containing a phosphorus atom include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'-alkylene phosphonates, 5'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3'-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and boranophosphates having normal 3'-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more internucleotide linkages is a 3' to 3', 5' to 5' or 2' to 2' linkage. Also contemplated are oligonucleotides having inverted polarity comprising a single 3' to 3' linkage at the 3'-most internucleotide linkage, i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleotide is missing or has a hydroxyl group in place thereof). Salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also contemplated. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of the above phosphorus-containing linkages include, U.S. Pat.

[0096] A "modified base" or other similar term refers to a composition which can pair with a natural base {e.g., adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and/or thymine) and/or can pair with a non- naturally occurring base. In certain aspects, the modified base provides a Tm differential of 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, or 2ยฐC. or less. Exemplary modified bases are described in EP 1 072 679 and WO 97/12896. [0097] By "nucleobase" is meant the naturally occurring nucleobases adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), thymine (T) and uracil (U) as well as non-naturally occurring nucleobases such as xanthine, diaminopurine, 8-oxo-N6-methyladenine, 7-deazaxanthine, 7-deazaguanine, N4,N4- ethanocytosin, N',N'-ethano-2,6-diaminopurine, 5-methylcytosine (mC), 5-(C3โ C6)-alkynyl- cytosine, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, pseudoisocytosine, 2-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-tr- iazolopyridin, isocytosine, isoguanine, inosine and the "non-naturally occurring" nucleobases described in Benner et al., U.S. Pat.

The term "nucleosidic base" or "base unit" is further intended to include compounds such as heterocyclic compounds that can serve like nucleobases including certain "universal bases" that are not nucleosidic bases in the most classical sense but serve as nucleosidic bases. Especially mentioned as universal bases are 3-nitropyrrole, optionally substituted indoles (e.g. , 5-nitroindole), and optionally substituted hypoxanthine.

The tocopherol is chosen from the group consisting of alpha-tocopherol, beta- tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol and delta-tocopherol. The non-lipophilic end of the tocopherol modified oligonucleotide is an oligonucleotide. This oligonucleotide is, in various embodiments, either RNA or DNA.

Indirect attachment includes, for example and without limitation, attachment to an oligonucleotide that is in turn attached to the liposomal particle. [0105] In some embodiments, the liposomal particle further comprises a diagnostic agent encapsulated on the internal side of the liposomal particle. This diagnostic agent is in some embodiments gadolinium. [0106] With respect to the surface density of oligonucleotides on the surface of a liposomal particle of the disclosure, it is contemplated that a liposomal particle as described herein comprises from about 1 to about 100 oligonucleotides on its surface. In various embodiments, a liposomal particle comprises from about 10 to about 100, or from 10 to about 90, or from about 10 to about 80, or from about 10 to about 70, or from about 10 to about 60, or from about 10 to about 50, or from about 10 to about 40, or from about 10 to about 30, or from about 10 to about 20 oligonucleotides on its surface.

Methods of Making Liposomal Particles [0107] In a fourth embodiment, methods of making liposomal particles are disclosed. First, a phospholipid, solvent, and a tocopherol modified oligonucleotide are provided. Then, the phospholipid is added to the solvent to form a first mixture comprising liposomes. The size of the liposomes in the first mixture is between about 100 nanometers and about 150 nanometers. [0108] Next, the liposomes are disrupted to create a second mixture comprising liposomes and small unilamellar vesicles (SUV). The size of the liposomes and SUVs in the second mixture is between about 20 nanometers and about 150 nanometers. [0109] Next, the SUVs having a particle size between about 20 nanometers and about 50 nanometers are isolated from the second mixture. Finally, the tocopherol modified oligonucleotide is added to the isolated SUVs to make a liposomal particle. [0110] The particle size of the liposomal particles created by a method of the disclosure is less than or equal to about 50 nanometers.

E. Uses of Liposomal Particles in Gene Regulation/Therapy [0112] Methods for inhibiting gene product expression provided herein include those wherein expression of the target gene product is inhibited by at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, or 100% compared to gene product expression in the absence of a liposome SNA. In other words, methods provided embrace those which results in essentially any degree of inhibition of expression of a target gene product. [0113] The degree of inhibition is determined in vivo from a body fluid sample or from a biopsy sample or by imaging techniques well known in the art. Alternatively, the degree of inhibition is determined in a cell culture assay, generally as a predictable measure of a degree of inhibition that can be expected in vivo resulting from use of a specific type of liposomal SNA and a specific oligonucleotide. [0114] In some aspects of the disclosure, it is contemplated that a liposomal particle performs both a gene inhibitory function as well as a therapeutic agent delivery function. In such aspects, a therapeutic agent is encapsulated in a liposomal particle of the disclosure and the particle is additionally functionalized with one or more oligonucleotides designed to effect inhibition of target gene expression. In further embodiments, a therapeutic agent is attached to a liposomal particle of the disclosure. [0115] In various aspects, the methods include use of an oligonucleotide which is 100% complementary to the target polynucleotide, i.e., a perfect match, while in other aspects, the oligonucleotide is at least (meaning greater than or equal to) about 95% complementary to the polynucleotide over the length of the oligonucleotide, at least about 90%, at least about 85%, at least about 80%, at least about 75%, at least about 70%, at least about 65%, at least about 60%, at least about 55%, at least about 50%, at least about 45%, at least about 40%, at least about 35%, at least about 30%, at least about 25%, at least about 20% complementary to the polynucleotide over the length of the oligonucleotide to the extent that the oligonucleotide is able to achieve the desired degree of inhibition of a target gene product. [0116] It is understood in the art that the sequence of an antisense compound need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be specifically hybridizable. Moreover, an oligonucleotide may hybridize over one or more segments such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure or hairpin structure). The percent complementarity is determined over the length of the oligonucleotide. For example, given an antisense compound in which 18 of 20 nucleotides of the antisense compound are complementary to a 20 nucleotide region in a target polynucleotide of 100 nucleotides total length, the oligonucleotide would be 90 percent complementary. In this example, the remaining noncomplementary nucleotides may be clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleobases and need not be contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleotides. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region of a target nucleic acid can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403-410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656). [0117] Accordingly, in a fifth embodiment, methods of utilizing liposomal particles in gene regulation therapy are provided. This method comprises the step of hybridizing a polynucleotide encoding said gene product with one or more oligonucleotides complementary to all or a portion of said polynucleotide, said oligonucleotide being attached to a liposomal particle, wherein hybridizing between said polynucleotide and said oligonucleotide occurs over a length of said polynucleotide with a degree of complementarity sufficient to inhibit expression of said gene product. The liposomal particle has a diameter that is about less than or equal to 50 nanometers. The inhibition of gene expression may occur in vivo or in vitro. [0118] The oligonucleotide utilized in this method is either RNA or DNA. The RNA can be an inhibitory RNA (RNAi) that performs a regulatory function, and in various embodiments is selected from the group consisting of a small inhibitory RNA (siRNA), an RNA that forms a triplex with double stranded DNA, and a ribozyme. Alternatively, the RNA is microRNA that performs a regulatory function. The DNA is, in some embodiments, an antisense-DNA. [0119] In another aspect of the disclosure, a liposomal particle is used in a method for treating a traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the United States, there have been over 244,000 cases of TBI in the military since 2000, and it is the leading cause of death and disability in people under the age of 45. Further, it is currently difficult to predict the neurological outcome of "mild severity" incidents, and the secondary phase of the injury (e.g. , inflammation, ischemia, and apoptosis) is very difficult to treat. [0120] Thus, in some embodiments, methods of the disclosure are directed to the use of a liposomal particle designed to target and regulate the expression of a gene product implicated in TBI. For example and without limitation, the target gene product is selected from the group consisting of histone deacetylase (HDAC), BCL2-associated X (BAX), a matrix metallopeptidase/metalloproteinase (MMP; including, without limitation, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9)), a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF; including, without limitation, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIFl-a)), and calpain. F. Use of Liposomal Particles in Immune Regulation [0121] Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins, expressed in sentinel cells, that plays a key role in regulation of innate immune system. The mammalian immune system uses two general strategies to combat infectious diseases. Pathogen exposure rapidly triggers an innate immune response that is characterized by the production of immuno stimulatory cytokines, chemokines and polyreactive IgM antibodies. The innate immune system is activated by exposure to Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed by a diverse group of infectious microorganisms. The recognition of PAMPs is mediated by members of the Toll-like family of receptors. TLR receptors, such as TLR 4, TLR 8 and TLR 9 that response to specific oligonucleotide are located inside special intracellular compartments, called endosomes. The mechanism of modulation of TLR 4, TLR 8 and TLR9 receptors is based on DNA-protein interactions. [0122] Synthetic immuno stimulatory oligonucleotides that contain CpG motifs that are similar to those found in bacterial DNA stimulate a similar response of the TLR receptors. Therefore immunomodulatory ODNs have various potential therapeutic uses, including treatment of immune deficiency and cancer. Employment of liposomal nanoparticles functionalized with immunomodulatory ODNs will allow for increased preferential uptake and therefore increased therapeutic efficacy. Notably, smaller particles (25 to 40 nm) such as those provided herein penetrate tissue barriers more efficiently, therefore providing more effective activation of innate immune responses. Thus, small liposomal nanoparticles of 30 nm in size, functionalized with stabilized with functional CpG motif-containing DNA, would provide enhanced therapeutic effect. [0123] Down regulation of the immune system would involve knocking down the gene responsible for the expression of the Toll-like receptor. This antisense approach involves use of liposomal nanoparticles functionalized with specific antisense oligonucleotide sequences to knock out the expression of any toll-like protein. [0124] Accordingly, in a sixth embodiment, methods of utilizing liposomal particles for modulating toll-like receptors are disclosed. The method either up-regulates or down-regulates the Toll-like-receptor through the use of a TLR agonist or a TLR antagonist, respectively. The method comprises contacting a cell having a toll-like receptor with a liposomal particle. The toll-like receptors modulated include toll-like receptor 1, toll-like receptor 2, toll-like receptor 3, toll-like receptor 4, toll-like receptor 5, toll-like receptor 6, toll-like receptor 7, toll-like receptor 8, toll-like receptor 9, toll-like receptor 10, toll-like receptor 11, toll-like receptor 12, and tolllike receptor 13. G. Use of Liposomal Particles in Nanoflare Technology [0125] In additional aspects of the disclosure, a liposomal particle is used to detect an intracellular target. Such methods are disclosed in U.S. Patent Number 8,507,200, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. [0126] Briefly, an oligonucleotide containing a recognition sequence that is specific for a target molecule is attached to a liposomal particle as described herein. Thus, "recognition sequence" as used herein is understood to mean a sequence that is partially or completely complementary to a target molecule of interest. [0127] The liposomal particle with attached oligonucleotide containing a recognition sequence is initially associated with a reporter sequence. As used herein, a "reporter sequence" is understood to mean a sequence that is partially or completely complementary and therefore able to hybridize to the recognition sequence. The reporter sequence is labeled with a detectable label (such as, without limitation, a fluorophore), and is also referred to as a nanoflare. The reporter sequence is in various aspects comprised of fewer, the same or more bases than the recognition sequence, such that binding of the recognition sequence to its target molecule causes release of the hybridized reporter sequence, thereby resulting in a detectable and measurable change in the label attached to the reporter sequence. [0128] The invention is illustrated by the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting in any way. EXAMPLES Example 1 - General [0129] All reagents were obtained from the suppliers in highest purity and used without any further purification. HPLC was performed on a Varian Prostar system. UV/Vis was recorded on a Varian Cary 300 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a SPEX FluoroLog fluorometer. Example 2 - Synthesis of Oligonucleotides [0130] Oligonucleotides were synthesized in 1.0 micromolar scale on an automated DNA synthesizer (ABI 3400, Applied Biosystems, Inc.). After cleavage and deprotection with aqueous ammonium hydroxide (55 ยฐC, 14 h), the DNA was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and quantified by UV spectrometer. Example 3 - Synthesis of Liposomal Particles [0131] The lipid monomer (40 ฮผฮนฮทฮฟฮ of l,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine(DOPC) dissolved in chloroform) was added to a 20 mL vial and then evaporated before overnight lyophilization to remove the solvent resulting in a thin lipid film. The film was then rehydrated with HBS buffer ( 5.0 mL, 20 mM Hepes buffer, 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4) followed by vigorous mixing to form a liposomal suspension and was then probe- sonicated in an ice bath for 30 min without pulsating. The resulting suspension was then ultracentrifuged at 104,986 g and 4 ยฐC for 90 min. The phospholipid concentration was calculated using elemental analysis. [0132] Next, the DNA/RNA strands were synthesized with the a-tocopherol modification via standard solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry on an Expedite Nucleotide Synthesis System. The strands were cleaved from the solid support and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. [0133] Lastly, the appropriate DNA/RNA (16 ฮผฮ) was added to the 1.3 mM solution of SUVs and allowed to stir overnight. The particles were then purified the next day by centrifugation filters with cut-off of 100 kDa. The particles were then analyzed via TEM and dynamic light scattering. Gel electrophoresis of liposomal particles encapsulated with FITC and surface functionalized with CY5-labeled DNA is shown in Figure 13. Example 4 - Visualization of the Cellular Uptake of Liposomal Particles [0134] To visualize the cellular uptake of LSNAs, HeLa cells were grown on a Lab-Tekยฎ II Chamber #1.5 German Coverglass System (Nalge Nunc International) overnight and incubated with Cy5-labled LSNAs (0.1 ฮผฮ of DNA concentration). After 16 hours of incubation, the media was replaced with fresh media, and live cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. All images were obtained with a Zeiss 510 LSM at 40x magnification using a Mai Tai 3308 laser (Spectra- Physics). Fluorescence emission was collected at 390 - 465 nm and 650-710 nm, with excitation at 729 and 633 nm respectively (Figure 5). The left panel of Figure 5 shows entry of liposomal fluorescein into HeLa cells, while the right panel of Figure 5 shows co-localization of fluorescein and Cy5 suggesting delivery of the entire liposome into the cell. Example 4 - Cell Viability [0135] The cytotoxicity of liposomal particles was evaluated with a Alamar Blueยฎ Assay (Invitrogen). Briefly, HeLa cells were seeded on a 96 well plate in 200 ฮผฮ^ of media and incubated for 24 hours. The cells were then treated with FITC encapsulated bare SUVs and DNA functionalized LSNAs at varying concentrations of phospholipid concentrations (0, 32.5, 65, 162.5 ฮผฮ). After 16 hours, medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS 3 times and then incubated with 90 ฮผฮ^ fresh culture medium in addition to 10 ฮผฮ^ of alamar blue reagent for 4 hours. They were then analyzed by checking the excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm. Example 5 - Preparation of SUVs Materials [0136] The l,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid monomer (DOPC), were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. either in dry powder form or in a chloroform solution and used without further purification. Phosphoramidites and other DNA synthesis reagents were purchased from Glen Research, Inc., at the highest purity and were used as received from the manufacturer. Instrumentation [0137] Lyophilization was carried out using a Freezone Lyohilizer (Labconco, Kansas City, MO). Sonication was conducted using a titanium- alloy solid probe sonicator (500 watt Vibra- Cellโข VC 505, Sonics & Materials, Inc., Newtown, CT) set at 40% intensity of 20 kHz without pulsing. Ultracentrifugation was carried out using Beckman-Coulter Avanti J-30I (Beckmann- Coulter, Inc., Indianapolis, IN). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using Hitachi-2300 STEM electron microscope. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was collected using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments, UK). MALDI-ToF analysis was performed using Bruker Autoflex III SmartBean mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Inc., MA, USA). Fluorescence measurements were carried out on Fluorlog-3 system (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc., NJ, USA). UV-Vis spectroscopy was collected using Cary 5000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. (Varian Inc., CA, USA). Oligonucleotide Synthesis [0138] The oligonucleotides were synthesized using automated solid-support phosphoramidite synthesis on an Expedite 8909 Nucleotide Synthesis System (MM48 Synthesizer, Bioautomation) using DCI as an activator. Tocopherol phosphoramidite was coupled via an automated protocol using extended 15 minutes coupling time. After the completion of solid phase synthesis, the oligonucleotide strands were cleaved from the solid support using an overnight treatment with aqueous ammonium hydroxide (28-30% aqueous solution, Aldrich), after which time the excess of the ammonia was removed using a gentle flow of nitrogen gas (house nitrogen was used). The oligonucleotides were purified using Microsorb C18 column on a reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC, Varian) using a gradient of TEAA (triethylammonium acetate) buffer and acetonitrile (gradient: 10% v/v to 100% v/v acetonitrile over 30 min). The collected fractions containing product were concentrated on a lyophilizer. The obtained oligonucleotides were re-suspended in nanopure water and purity was analyzed using MALDI-TOF and denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques.

Oligonucleotide sequences used in the experiments. Synthesis of small unilamellar vesicles [0139] The volume of lipid monomer stock solution (25 - 50 mg) was added to a 20 mL vial and placed into a 25 mL glass vial and the solvent was carefully evaporated using a stream of nitrogen. The obtained lipid monomer was further dried overnight under vacuum to remove the residual chloroform. The resulting lipid film was then hydrated with 20 mM HBS (5.0 mL) followed by vortexing the vial to form a liposomal suspension. This suspension was further probe- sonicated for 30 min keeping the temperature of the lipid mixture below 10 ยฐC (cooling with an ice-water bath). After the sonication, the suspension was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000xg for 90 min at 12 ยฐC. After the centrifugation, the clear supernatant containing the desired small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) was collected and the pellet was discarded (Figure 1). To obtain particles with a narrower size distribution, the obtained SUV particles were further extruded through polycarbonate membrane (30 nm pore size). [0140] The obtained SUVs were further analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques (Figure 11). The final phospholipid concentration in a given sample was determined via inductive coupled plasmon mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The number of liposomes in solution and the number of oligonucleotides on the surface of a liposome can be calculated according to the equation depicted in Figure 12. Preparation of DNA functionalized Liposomal SNAs [0141] In order to prepare liposomal SNAs, 15 ฮผฮ of the desired 3'-tocopherol modified oligonucleotide was added to a SUV solution (1.3 mM of [phospholipid]) and allowed to shake overnight. The resulting solution was then purified via gel filtration chromatography on cross- linked sepharose column (Separose CL 4B, Aldrich). The particle size distribution was analyzed using DLS. To observe the liposomal SNAs using TEM, the samples were placed onto plasma- cleaned carbon TEM grids and further stained with solution of uranyl acetate (2% w/v) (stained for 2 min then washed with water and allowed to dry). The dried grid was then imaged under the Hitachi-2300 STEM electron microscope. Gel electrophoresis of Liposomal SNAs [0142] All gel electrophoresis experiments were conducted in a 1% agarose gel in lxTBE (tris borate, EDTA) buffer. The samples were loaded in the wells with the aid of glycerol (30% v/v, 5 ฮผ > as a loading agent. The gel chamber was filled with lxTBE and was precooled with ice. The gels were run at 70V for 1 hour at 10 ยฐC and the images of the gel were recorded with Fluorchem Q with a Cy5 filter. Quantification of DNA density on the liposomal surface [0143] To determine the loading of DNA on the surface of liposomes, an increasing concentration of Cy5 -labeled 3' tocopherol-modified DNA was incubated overnight with a fixed concentration of SUVs (1.3 mM of [P]). The liposomal SNAs were then analyzed using gel electrophoresis. To quantify the DNA density functionalized on the SUVs, the constructs were dissolved in 1% SDS solution and absorbance was collected at 260 nm and calculated using the extinction coefficient of the respective DNA strand. The number of liposomes in the corresponding solution was calculated using the theoretical equation with the assumption that the phospholipid concentration of the liposomes remains constant after functionalization. Melting Assays [0144] A two nanoparticle-component system was formed using liposomal SNAs functionalized with strands complementary to the linker strand as described in Table 1. The aggregates were formed by addition of two DNA functionalized Liposomal SNAs and hybridizing them to the linker strand in a 1: 1 ratio (the total DNA concentration 1.5 ฮผฮ, volume 1 mL). The absorbance spectra for the liposomal SNAs with the linker was collected using Cary 5000 UV-Vis spectrometer and compared to the absorbance spectra of liposomal SNAs without the linker. The aggregates were then subjected to a gradual increase in temperature at a rate of 0.25 ยฐC/min from 20 to 65 ยฐC and the absorbance was monitored at 260 nm for the aggregates. Rhodamine encapsulation [0145] Dry DOPC monomer (25 mg) was resuspended in a 20 mM Sulforhodamine B solution in HBS (5 mL). The resulting suspension was gradually extruded through a series of polycarbonate membranes, 100 nm, 80 nm, 50 nm, 30 nm sizes. The rhodamine containing liposomes were separated from the free rhodamine via gel filtration chromatography on cross- linked sepharose (Sepharose CL-4B, Aldrich). The obtained particles were functionalized with DNA-tocopherol conjugates using the procedure described above. To analyze the serum stability of the constructs, the rhodamine containing liposomes and liposomal-SNAs were suspended in 10% fetal bovine serum solution in HBS, and the release of the dye was monitored in a Fluorlog- 3 system by exciting the sample at 420 nm and measuring the intensity at 480 nm. Cell Culture studies [0146] SKOV-3 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were grown in the McCoy's 5 A medium with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U of penicillin and 50 ฮผg of streptomycin and maintained at 37 ยฐC with 5% C02 as per ATCC instructions. For cellular studies, the cells were plated 24 hours prior to the treatment at the 50% confluency. Confocal Microscopy of Liposomal SNAs [0147] For visualizing of the cellular internalization of liposomal SNAs, the SKOV3 cells were plated on 35 mm FluoroDishโข chamber at 50% confluent. The cells were incubated with Cy5-labeled liposomal SNAs (ฮ.ฮฮผฮ of DNA concentration) in media for 20 hours followed by three washes with lx PBS containing 0.01% (by volume) tween-20 then replaced with fresh media. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 3342 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The live cells were then imaged with Zeiss LSM 510 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope with Mai Tai 3308 laser (Spectra-Physics) at 40 x magnification. The Hoechst was excited at 780 nm and collected at 390-495 nm and excited at 640 nm and emission at 650-710 nm. Flow Cytometry Experiments [0148] To compare the cellular uptake of liposomal SNAs to free-DNA strand, the cells were plated on a 96 well in 100 ฮผฮ^ of media and incubated with 0.1 ฮผฮ concentration of free-DNA or liposomal SNAs and for 24 hours. The untreated cells were used as a negative control for the experiment. After the incubation period, the cells were washed 3 times with 1 x PBS containing 0.01 (by volume) of Tween-20 and then trypsinized to form a suspension. Flow cytometry was performed on the cellular suspension using Cy5 intensity channel on Guava easyCyte 8HT (Millipore, USA) using the signal from the untreated cells as for background intensity. The error values were calculated using the standard error of the mean of median signal from different wells representing a single sample. Cytotoxicity studies (MTT assay): [0149] To evaluate the cytotoxicity of the liposomal SNAs, the SKOV-3 cells were plated on a 96 well 24 hours before the experiment. The cells were treated with liposomal SNAs at varying concentration of DNA for 24 hours. The cytotoxicity of liposomal SNAs was compared to DharmaFECTยฎ 1 (Dharmacon), a commercially available transfection agent. The cells were transfected with varying concentrations of DNA transfected with DharmaFECTยฎ 1 following the manufacturer's transfection protocol. The cells, that didn't receive the treatment, were used as a negative control. After the incubation period of 24 hours, the cells were washed three times with lx PBS and incubated with alamarBlueยฎ solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and incubated at 37 ยฐC in 5% C02 for 4 hours. The fluorescence emission at 590 nm was recorded using the BioTek, Synergy H4 Hybrid Reader. Western Blotting to quantify HER2 protein knockdown [0150] The SKOV-3 cells were plated in a 6-well plate and incubated at 37 ยฐC in 5% C02 overnight. The cells were incubated with anti-HER2 antisense liposomal SNAs and scrambled liposomal SNAs. After a treatment of 24 hours, the medium was replaced with fresh medium and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 48 hours. To analyze the HER2 protein knockdown, the cells were collected and re-suspended in 100 ฮผฮ^ of mammalian cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, MA, USA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. (Thermo Scientific, IL, USA). The protein concentration in the cell ly sates was determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, IL, USA). Equal amounts (20 ฮผg) of proteins were fractionated by 4-20% Precast gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membranes (Thermo Scientific, IL, USA). The membrane was blocked using 5% dry non-fat milk solution (w/v) in tris-buffered saline (TBS). The proteins were detected with primary rabbit antibodies against HER2 (1: 1000), and GAPDH (1:500) followed by anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1: 10,000) (LI-COR Biosciences, NE, USA). The fluorescence signal was recorded using the Odysseyยฎ Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, NE, USA). Synthesis [0151] A typical liposomal SNA was synthesized in two steps (Figure 7). The first step involves the preparation of 30 nm diameter unilamellar vesicles from lipid monomers. This size particle is ideal from the standpoints of SNA transfection and is in the appropriate range for maximizing higher blood circulation and minimizing clearance through the kidneys. Unfortunately, liposomes in this size regime are often unstable and fuse to form larger structures. Therefore, a goal of this work was to determine a way of synthesizing such structures and avoiding such particle growth pathways. [0152] To prepare small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), DOPC (l,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine), an unsaturated lipid containing two oleic acid derivatives extending from a phosphate moiety and terminated with a quaternary ammonium head group, was selected. In a typical experiment, a suspension of DOPC monomers in 20 mM HBS was sonicated to produce on average 30 nm SUV particles. The particles were isolated by centrifugation (100,000 x g). Further extrusion of this material, through a polycarbonate membrane with 30 nm pores yielded particles with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.11 in 70% overall yield. The particles were then redispersed in saline, and DLS was used to confirm their 30 + 3 nm diameter, which was also subsequently confirmed by TEM analysis using negative staining. [0153] The second step of the synthesis involves surface functionalization of the liposome with a nucleic acid derivative possessing a hydrophobic tocopherol moiety, which effectively inserts into the lipid bilayer defining the SUV. Although a variety of hydrophobic head groups might be suitable [Pfeiffer et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126: 10224 (2004); Banchelli et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 112: 10942 (2008); Dave et al., ACS Nano 5: 1304 (2011); Jakobsen et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 24: 1485 (2013)], a-tocopherol (a form of vitamin E) was chosen because of its biocompatibility and low cost. The a-tocopherol was installed onto nucleic acid strands (DNA) via a conventional oligonucleotide synthesis, utilizing a commercially available tocopherol phosphoramidite derivative (Glenn Research). The liposomal SNAs were synthesized by incubating a suspension of SUVs (1.3 mM by lipid) with the nucleic acid- tocopherol conjugates (16 mM) using a lipid- to-nucleic acid ratio of 8: 1 for 12 hours at room temperature. The liposome-free tocopherol-nucleic acid was then removed from the sample by size exclusion chromatography on a sepharose column (Sepharose 4LB). In the case of DNA, a significant drop in the zeta potential from -1 to -23 occurs after this step, indicating liposome surface functionalization with the negatively charged nucleic acid. In addition, dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis of the final nanoparticle samples showed an increase in particle size from 30 to 46 nm, consistent with the loading of the 8-9 nm long duplex structure. To determine quantitatively the average number of nucleic strands loaded onto the surface of a liposome, the liposomal-SNAs were dissolved in the presence of Triton X to release them. The final nucleic acid concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm relative to a calibrated oligonucleotide standard. The liposomal SNAs coated with DNA had on average of 70 strands per particle (Figure 17). This density is lower than a typical gold-based SNA structure [Hurst et al., Anal. Chem. 78:8313 (2006)] but sufficient to exhibit many of the cooperative properties of such structures. A graphical depiction of a liposomal SNA is provided in Figure 16. [0154] These liposome SNA structures have several interesting properties. First, they are remarkably stable compared to the native 30 nm liposome constructs from which they have been derived (Figure 2, Figure 8). For example, if the SUVs without an oligonucleotide surface layer are stored for four days at 37 ยฐC (physiological temperature), they fuse and form larger polydisperse structures (on average 100 nm structures with some micron-sized entities). In contrast, the liposomal SNAs show no evidence of particle degradation or fusion over the same time period under nearly identical conditions. This increase in stability for the liposomal-SNA system is likely a result of the repulsive forces between the negatively charged nucleic acid strands that comprise the liposomal-SNAs surface, which both stabilizes the individual particles and inhibit particle-particle fusion interactions [Li et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 24: 1790 (2013)]. Moreover, the negatively charged DNA corona on the liposomal-SNA serves as a protecting layer for the liposomal core preventing its degradation in the presence of serum proteins [Senior et al., Life Sci. 30: 2123 (1982); Kim et al., Arch. Pharmacal Res. 14: 336 (1991); Sulkowski et al., J. Mol. Struct. 744-747: 737 (2005)]. For example, serum stability of the liposomal-SNAs system was investigated by measuring the release of a sulforhodamine dye physically incorporated within the core of a liposomal-SNA at a self-quenching concentration of 20 mM (core concentration). In this experiment, rupture of the liposomal core results in a release of the sulforhodamine dye from the interior of the particle and a subsequent elimination of self- quenching, thus giving rise to an increase in fluorescence [Versluis et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 135: 8057 (2013)]. In a typical experiment, rhodamine-containing liposomal nanoparticles were incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 ยฐC, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded continuously for 3 hours. The same stability study was performed for non-functionalized particles. Similar to the thermal stability studies, DNA-functionalized particles remained stable in serum for the duration of experiment. No release of the dye was observed during 3 hours of incubation. In contrast, incubation of the bare DOPC liposomes led to a significant release of the rhodamine fluorophore indicating fast decomposition of the liposomal structure in serum (Figure 8). [0155] A second property of liposomal SNAs is their ability to cooperatively bind complementary nucleic acids. This is a hallmark feature of all SNAs and derives from the densely packed and highly oriented configuration of the surface-bound nucleic acids. To explore the binding and subsequent melting properties of the liposomal-SNA constructs, two sets of liposomal-SNA nanoparticles were synthesized, each made with different DNA sequences: particle A and particle B. A DNA linker sequence that is complementary to the oligonucleotide sequences of the liposomal-SNAs was used to facilitate polymerization through hybridization. Upon addition of the linker sequence to an equimolar mixture of the two liposomal SNA particles, aggregation occurred as evidenced by DLS and eventually a flaky precipitate was formed [Dave et al., ACS Nano 5: 1304 (2011)]. These aggregates were re-suspended in 20 mM HBS (150 mM NaCl), and a melting analysis was performed by monitoring the absorbance at 260 nm. Importantly, a remarkably narrow melting transition was observed at 47.5 ยฐC (full width at half-maximum of the first derivative is approximately 2 ยฐC), which is highly diagnostic of an SNA structure with a high surface density of nucleic acids (Figure 9). [0156] An important property of SNAs pertains to their ability to enter cells without the need for ancillary transfection agents [Cutler et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 134: 1376 (2012)]. To determine if liposomal SNAs exhibit this behavior, ovarian cancer ascites (SKOV3, American Type Culture Collection) were incubated in the presence of the liposomal SNAs synthesized with a 5'-Cy5-labeled DNA in the absence of any transfection agents at different DNA concentrations. The uptake of liposomal-SNAs in SKOV3 cells was analyzed using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry techniques. Remarkably, liposomal SNAs readily entered cells in high quantities even after 1 hour of incubation, which demonstrates their utility as intracellular probes and target regulating agents. In addition, no significant uptake of free DNA strand (5'-Cy5-labeled) in SKOV3 cells was detected even after 36 hours of incubation under identical conditions. Similar to the Au-SNAs, high uptake of liposomal-SNAs in SKOV3 cells didn't cause any toxicity even at high concentrations (Figure 10). Conversely, employment of the DharmaFECT in an attempt to deliver equal DNA delivered by the liposomal-SNAs resulted in a significant cytotoxicity, which reduced cell viability to 35% over a 24 hour time period of incubation. [0157] After establishing that liposomal-SNAs are not cytotoxic, a liposomal-SNA was synthesized that was capable of knocking down human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) - an oncogene overexpressed in SKOV3 cells [Zhang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 134: 16488 (2012)]. To compare the effectiveness of the antisense activity of liposomal-SNAs to that of conventional transfection systems, SKOV3 cells were incubated in the presence of anti-HER2 liposomal-SNAs, and control liposomal-SNAs (each at a total DNA concentration of 1 ฮผฮ). After 72 hours of incubation, the cells were harvested and analyzed for protein content by Western blotting. Importantly, HER2 protein levels were reduced by 85% in the presence of anti-HER2 liposomal-SNAs compared to the internal reference gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Figure 10). Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential to use the liposomal-SNAs to effect both cellular transfection and gene regulation. [0158] In summary, a scalable synthetic route for novel metal-free liposomal SNAs has been developed. Such structures are assembled rapidly from readily available, non-toxic starting materials. The nucleic acid architecture not only stabilizes these small liposomal structures but also facilitates their internalization by SKOV3 cells. Consequently, such structures show utility as new biocompatible gene regulation constructs that exhibit many of the attractive properties of the more conventional gold nanoparticle-based SNAs. Example 6 - Testing liposomal particles in Ramos-Blueโข Cells [0159] Ramos-Blueโข cells are NF-KB/AP-1 reporter B lymphocyte cells. Ramos-Blue is a B lymphocyte cell line that stably expresses an NF- ฮบฮ /AP-1 -inducible SEAP (secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase) reporter gene. When stimulated, they produce SEAP in the supernatant that can be readily monitored using the QUANTI-Blue assay. QUANTI-Blue is a SEAP detection medium that turns blue in the presence of SEAP (Figure 14). [0160] When contacted with CpG-containing oligonucleotides, activation of the Ramos-Blue cells was detected (Figure 15). Representative compounds were synthesized based on the TLR 9-agonizing oligonucleotide CpG 7909 (5 '-TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT- 3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 8)). These include CpG 7909 with a phosphodiester backbone densely functionalized on 13 nm gold nanoparticles (CpG 7909-po SNA (Au)), CpG 7909 with a fully phosphorothioate backbone (CpG 7909-ps), a liposomal SNA with a phosphodiester CpG 7909 (7909 targeting (particle)), a liposomal SNA with the C and G of the all phosphodiester backbone oligonucleotide inverted to eliminate the TLR 9 binding site (7909 control (particle)), CpG 7909 with a phosphodiester backbone and 3'-tocopherol lipid without being formulated into a liposomal SNA (7909 targeting (tocopherol)), and a control sequence with the C and G inverted that is also not formulated into a liposomal SNA (7909 control (tocopherol)). These compounds were serially diluted then incubated with Ramos-Blue cells, a cell line that expresses secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) upon activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF- KB, overnight and then probed for SEAP levels in the cell culture media via the QuantiBlue kit (InVivogen). Activation is measured by absorption of light at 650 nm. Example 7 - Use of liposomal particles to regulate HIFl-a [0161] To further demonstrate the effectiveness of a composition of the disclosure, liposomal particles were designed to individually target HIFl-a and BAX. The experiments utilized the Neuro-2a (N2A) cell line, which is a fast-growing mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Contacting the N2A cells with liposomal particles targeting both HIFl-a (Figure 18) and BAX (Figure 19) showed a significant reducdtion in the amount of target gene product. In each of the experiments, the relative amount of mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) 72 hours after beginning treatment of the N2A cells in 6-well plates - cells were treated with the liposomal particles for 24 hours in OptiMEM prior to removal of the liposomal particles and replacement of the media with MEM and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). [0162] For the experiments in which HIFl-a was targeted, the N2A cells were first subjected to Cocl2-stimulated hypoxia, which increased HIFl-a mRNA expression by about 50%. Next, the N2A cells were contacted with the liposomal particles functionalized with siRNA directed against HIFl-a. The contacting resulted in a knockdown of HIFl-a of about 50% (Figure 18). [0163] For the experiments in which BAX was targeted, treatment of N2A cells with the resulted in an approximate 65% knockdown of BAX mRNA by the liposomal particles and greater than 50% knockdown of BAX mRNA by lipid micelle SNAs (as measured against control liposomal SNAs) (Figure 19). [0164] These experiments showed that the liposomal particles of the disclosure are highly effective at inhibiting target gene expression in mammalian cells.
