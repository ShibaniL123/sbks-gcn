STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002] The invention was made with Government support under Contract No. 1PO1AG034906 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights to the invention. TECHNICAL FIELD [0003] In at least one aspect, the present invention relates to methods to specifically target and kill cancer cells and alleviate toxic effects of chemotherapy. BACKGROUND [0004] Cancer is a ubiquitous disease afflicting mammals and in particular humans. Progress in treating cancer has been steady though a non-surgical cure in most cancers has not been realized. Research has shown that cancer is a multifaceted illness that is currently not completely understood. Therefore, future treatment protocols will undoubtedly involve pathways not currently appreciated. [0005] A relatively new pathway for treating cancer involves Short-Term Starvation (STS) and Fasting Mimicking Diets. Short-term starvation and fasting mimicking diets have been shown to be effective in the sensitization of a variety of cancer cell types to chemotherapy by Differential Stress Sensitization (DSS), while protecting normal cells and tissues by Differential Stress Resistance (DSR). [0006] Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods for treating subject afflicted with cancer. SUMMARY [0007] The present invention solves one or more problems of the prior art by providing, in at least one embodiment, a method of alleviating or treating symptoms of cancer and/or effects of chemotherapy or of kinase inhibitors. The method includes a step of identifying a subject having cancer. A reduced caloric diet is administered to the subject for a first time period. Characteristically, the reduced caloric diet provides at most 1000 kcal per day. A kinase inhibitor is administered to the subject. [0008] In another embodiment, a method for treating cancer and/or alleviating a symptom of chemotherapy is provided. The method includes a step of identifying a subject having cancer. A reduced caloric diet is administered to the subject for a first time period. Characteristically, the reduced caloric diet provides at most 1000 kcal per day. A chemotherapeutic agent is administered to the subject after the first time period. [0009] In another embodiment, a method for alleviating a side effect of kinase inhibitor treatment is provided. The method includes a step of identifying a subject being treated with a kinase inhibitor. A reduced caloric diet is administered to the subject for a first time period. Characteristically, the reduced caloric diet provides at most 1000 kcal per day. A kinase inhibitor is administered to the subject. [0010] Advantageously in the embodiments of the invention, STS or FMD in combination with kinases inhibitors is used to: a) offer a safe and powerful tool in the treatment of cancer without chemotherapy, b) potentiate the already beneficial effect of short term starvation in combination with chemo-drugs in cancer treatment (Fig.3and 4), and c) to reverse the toxic effects observed during administration of the kinase inhibitors combined with traditional chemo-drugs alone (Fig.2).

[0041] In an embodiment, a method of alleviating or treating symptoms of cancer and/or side effects of chemotherapy or side effects of kinase inhibitors includes a step of identifying a subject in need thereof. A reduced caloric diet is administered to the subject for a first time period. Characteristically, the reduced caloric diet providing at most 1000 kcal per day. A kinase inhibitor is administered to the subject before, after, or during the first time period. [0042] In another embodiment, a method for alleviating a side effect of kinase inhibitor treatment is provided. The method includes a step of identifying a subject being treated with a kinase inhibitor. In a refinement, the kinase inhibitor is an mTOR protein kinase. A reduced caloric diet is administered to the subject for a first time period. Characteristically, the reduced caloric diet provides at most 1000 kcal per day. A kinase inhibitor is administered to the subject. In some refinements, the steps of administering the reduced caloric diet and administering of the kinase inhibitor constitute a treatment cycle that can be repeated a plurality of times as set forth below. [0043] In still another embodiment of the present invention, a subject having cancer and/or receiving chemotherapy is identified. A kinase inhibitor (e.g., Rapamyicin) is administered to the subject along with a reduced caloric diet. The reduced caloric diet is either a short-term starvation (STS) or a fasting mimicking diet (FMD) that is administered for a first time period. In a refinement, the kinase inhibitor is an mTOR protein kinase. In short-term starvation, the subject is provided with substantially 0 kilocalories per day. In general, the FMD diet provides less than about 1000 kilocalories per day when administered. Details of the FMD diet are set for the below in more detail. In another variation, a chemotherapeutic agent that is different than the kinase inhibitor is also administered to the subject during treatment. Examples of suitable chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, topotecan, vincristine, doxorubicin, and combinations thereof. Dosages of the chemotherapeutic agents are those known in the art for treating various cancers with such agents. The present embodiment is found particularly useful for treating subject having melanoma, neuroblastoma, or breast cancer or being treated by chemotherapy for these conditions. Moreover, the treatment protocol of the present embodiment results in a lower tumor volume than treatment with chemotherapeutic agents that do not combine kinase inhibitors with the reduced caloric diet set forth herein. In other refinements, the steps of administering the reduced caloric diet, administering of the chemotherapeutic agent and administering of the kinase inhibitor constitute a treatment cycle that can be repeated a plurality of times. Advantageously, the methods of the invention which include STS or FMDs. reduce or completely reverse mortality induced by doxorubicin and worsened by the combination of doxorubicin and rapamycin. [0044] In the context of the present embodiments, it should be appreciated that multiple changes occur during STS and FMD at the molecular and physiological levels including (but not exclusively) the down-regulation of factors including IGF-I, and signal transduction proteins such as mTOR and PKA. Advantageously, the methods of the present invention cause a reduction in a variety of amino acids, insulin and glucose while increasing ketone bodies (KB) (see Figure 1 described below in detail). In particular, the methods induce cancer cells, which are typically in a glycolytic state (Warburg effect), to switch and rely on respiration for energy production and survival. All these molecules, actors and proteins modulate normal-cell growth in part by regulating serine/threonine protein kinases. Virtually all cancer cells have mutations in oncogenes, which make them unresponsive to external changes. However, internally the cancer cells can in some cases switch to an alternative pathway. Advantageously, this phenomenon supports the inventive concept of administrating kinases inhibitors with STS/FMD, in which the STS/FMD prevent or inhibit the activation of the alternative pathways. [0045] Specific kinases and other growth inhibitors can reduce cancer progression, particularly if the inhibitor acts downstream of the oncogenic mutation. The multiple changes induced by STS and FMD promote an additional growth inhibitory effect that can affect pathways not targeted by the kinase inhibitor. In particular, FMD causes a significant reduction in a wide variety of nutrients along with a significant increase in others such as ketone bodies and fatty acids, Therefore, the combination of STS and FMD with kinase inhibitors provides a synergistic pro-death role with inhibitors of kinases and other proteins affecting cell growth. These effects can occur during STS/FMD regimen but can be potentiated further by chemotherapy (see Figures 3 and 4 described below). In addition, kinases and other signal transduction inhibitors can delay cancer growth but also cause major side effects and even death (Fig. 2D) to normal cells. The STS or FMD reverses the increased mortality induced by the co-administration of kinase inhibitors with chemotherapy, in part by reducing the activity of the pathways affected by the kinase inhibitor in normal cells (see Figure 2 described below). [0046] Examples of STS and FMD protocols that can be used in the present embodiments are found in U.S. Pat. Appl. Nos. 12/430,058 and 13/488,590; the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In a variation, the reduced caloric diet provides a hypo-caloric or calorie free diet. The diet contains dietary materials capable of providing nutrition to a human subject while providing no more than 1000 kcal per day, and in particular, no more than 813-957 kcal per day. In a variation, the reduced caloric diet provides from about 100 to 1000 kcal per day to the subject. In a refinement, the reduced caloric diet provides at most, in increasing order of preferences 1000, 957, 700, 500, 300, or 100 kcal per day to the subject. In still another refinement, the diet provides 0 kcal per day. [0047] In variations of the embodiments set forth herein, the reduced caloric diet provides protein to the subject in an amount that is less than or equal to 30-36 g per day. In a refinement, the reduced caloric diet provides protein to the subject in an amount that is less than or equal to, in increasing order of preference, 40, 35, 20, 10, or 5 g, or 0 g per day. If carbohydrates are present in the dietary materials, no more than half of the energy of the reduced caloric diet is in the carbohydrates. In a refinement, the STS/FMD diet may be administered to the subject for 3-10 consecutive days prior to when the subject is exposed to chemotherapy. The diet may also be administered to the subject for 24 hours following the exposure. Preferably, the diet may be administered to the subject for both 3-10 consecutive days prior to when the subject is exposed to chemotherapy and 24 hours following the exposure. [0048] In a variation of each of the embodiment set forth herein, the kinase inhibitor can be administered within a week of the start of a cycle of the reduced caloric diet (i.e., the first time perior). In still another refinement, the kinase inhibitor can be administered within 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days of the start of a cycle the reduced caloric diet. In another variation, the kinase inhibitor is administered after but within a week of the end of a cycle of the reduced calorie diet. In still another refinement, the kinase inhibitor can be administered after but within 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days of the end of a cycle the reduced calorie diet. In another variation, the reduced caloric diet is administered for a total time period of 3 days to 14 days per treatment cycle. In still another refinement, the reduced caloric diet is administered for a total time period per treatment cycle of 3 days to 10 days. As set forth above, the steps of administering the reduced caloric diet, administering of the chemotherapeutic agent (when used), and administering of the kinase inhibitor constitute a treatment cycle that can be repeated a plurality of times at predetermined intervals. For example, this treatment cycle can be repeated at intervals from two weeks to two months. In a refinement, this treatment cycle can be repeated at intervals from two weeks to 1 month. [0049] In other variations of the embodiments set forth herein, the reduced caloric diet provides nutrition while providing no more than 11 kcal (e.g., no more than 8, 5, or 2 kcal, or 0 kcal) energy per kg body weight of the subject per day and no more than 0.4 g (e.g., 0.3, 0.2, or 0.1 g or 0 g) protein per kg body weight of the animal or human per day. If carbohydrates are present in the diet, no more than half of the energy is in the carbohydrates. In some embodiments, the diet is capable of providing no more than 700 kcal (e.g., 600, 400, or 200 kcal or 0 kcal) total energy per day. When the subject is exposed to chemotherapy, normal cells, but not abnormal cells such as cancer cells, in the animal or human are protected. For example, the diet may be administered to the animal or human for 3-10 consecutive days prior to the subject's exposure to chemotherapy. The diet may also be administered to the subject for 24 hours following the exposure. Preferably, the diet may be administered to the subject for both 3-10 consecutive days prior to the subject's exposure to chemotherapy and 24 hours following the exposure. [0050] In another variation, the STS/FMD protocol used for the reduced caloric diet involves fasting mimicking diets. For example, the subject suffering from cancer may be fasted for 48-140 hours prior to one round of chemotherapy or 4-56 hours following the chemotherapy. Preferably, the subject suffering from cancer is given a FMD for 48-140 hours prior to one round of chemotherapy and 4-56 hours following the chemotherapy. [0051] Examples of FMD diets are found in U.S. Pat. Appl. Nos. 14060494 and 14178953; the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by references. Typically, in the FMD protocol a subject's diet is substituted for a predetermined number of days (i.e. 5 days). During this period, subjects consume plenty of water. For healthy subjects of normal weight (Body Mass Index or BMI between 18.5-25), the diet is consumed once a month (5 days on the diet and 25-26 days on their normal diet) for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter (5 days every 3 months). The weight of the subject is measured and the subject must regain at least 95% of the weight lost during the diet before the next cycle is begun. Subjects with BMI of less than 18.5 should not undertake the FMD unless recommended and supervised by a physician. The same regimen (once every month for 3 months followed by once every 3 months thereafter) can be adopted for the treatment, or in support of the treatment, of all of the conditions presented in the patent applications. U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 14178953 provides a low protein version of the FMD diet. [0052] As set forth above, the embodiments of the invention call for the administration of a kinase inhibitor, and in particular, an mTOR kinase inhibitor. Rapamycin is one particularly useful mTOR kinase inhibitor. Typically, rapamycin is administered in a dosage of 5 to 20 mg per day. Examples of other kinase inhibitors include, Afatinib (Gilotrif) (target is EGFR/ErbB2 for treating non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) - 40 mg orally once daily); Axitinib (target is VEGFR 1 /VEGFR2/VEGFR3/PDGFRB/ c-KIT for treating Renal Cell Carcinoma - 5 mg twice daily); Ruxolitinib (target is JAK for treating myelofibrosis - between 5 and 25 mg orally twice a day depending on the WBC count); Imatinib (gleevec) (target is Bcr - Abl for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) - 400 mg to 600 mg once daily); Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) (target is BRAF for treating late stage melanoma - 960 mg every 12hours); Bosutinib (Bosulif) (target is BcrAbl/SRC for treating Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia - 500 mg once a day with food); and combinations thereof. [0053] An FMD for mammal subjects and in particular humans, substitutes the normal diet of a cancer patient for a period of 5 to 21 days with a 17 day maximum for most patients (see below) with frequency to be determined based on the frequency and efficacy of other treatments, with more frequent use needed when other treatments are not effective in cancer treatment. The ability of the patient to regain weight before the next cycle is initiated must also be considered, with patients with more severe symptoms able to regain weight receiving the diet as frequently as the other treatments are given and patients who are not regaining weight or are unable to undergo the full dietary period being placed on the FMD only after they return to the normal weight (weight before treatment is initiated but also BMI above 18). The FMD consists of ingredients which are Generally Regarded As Safe (RGAS). Calories are consumed according to the subject's body weight. For day 1, total calorie consumption is 4.5-7 calorie per pound (or 10-16 calorie per kilogram). The diet should be at least 90% plant based. The day 1 diet should contain less than 30 g of sugars, less than 28 g of plant based proteins, 20-30 grams of plant based monounsaturated fats, 6-10 g of plant based polyunsaturated fats and 2-12 g of plant based saturated fats. For days 2-21, total calorie consumption is 3-5 calorie per pound (or 7-11 calorie per kilogram). The days 2-21 diet should contain less than 20 g of sugars, less than 18 g of plant based proteins, 10-15 g of plant based monounsaturated fats, 3-5 g of plant based polyunsaturated fats and 1-6 grams of plant based saturated fats, 10-30 grams of glycerol diluted in 1 liter of water/day, based on body weight (10 grams for a 100 pound person, 20 grams for a 200 pound person and 30 grams for a 300 pound person). Diet should also be high nourishment containing approximately 50% of the RDA (daily) for vitamins, minerals + essential fatty acids. The minimum length will be 5 or 6 days and the maximum length 21 days (based on safety data and standard of care practice at fasting clinics). [0054] The following examples are intended to illustrate, but not to limit, the scope of the invention. While such examples are typical of those that might be used, other procedures known to those skilled in the art may alternatively be utilized. Indeed, those of ordinary skill in the art can readily envision and produce further embodiments, based on the teachings herein, without undue experimentation. DSS and DSR Experiments [0055] The methods of the present invention have been largely tested in in vitro and in vivo murine models. STS and FMD have also been tested in different clinical trials, which have shown the safety and feasibility of the two dietary interventions. FMD diet has shown to be as effective as STS in evoking both DSS and DSR. [0056] Methods: Short term starvation (STS) or fasting mimicking diet (FMD) were administrated bi-weekly for periods of 48h or 4 days, respectively. The end of the dietary intervention coincided with the administration of doxorubicin by intravenous injection. The animals were given a period of 10 to 12 days to recover bodyweight between one cycle of dietary intervention and the next. Rapamycin was administrated intraperitoneally every day during the ad lib feeding but not during dietary intervention, for the entire duration of the experiment. Physiological and molecular markers such as circulating glucose, ketone bodies and S6K levels were observed in order to validate the efficacy of the treatment. Figure 1A shows that rapamycin treatment induces an insulin-resistance-like state causing an increase of blood glucose. The decreased blood glucose in Rapa + STS/FMD mice supports the hypothesis that mice treated with Rapa and STS/FMD are more resistant than mice treated with rapamycin alone. Figure IB shows that as expected, ketone bodies (KB) levels were significantly increased during STS/FMD, with or without rapamycin administration. One-way ANOVA test was performed and differences with p-value<0.05 were considered significant (p-value<0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 are indicated as *, *, and respectively). [0057] Diet (mouse): Mice were maintained on irradiated TD.7912 rodent chow (Harlan Teklad). In brief, this diet contains 3.T5kcal/g of digestible energy with calories supplied by protein, carbohydrate and fat in a percent ratio of 25: 58: 17. Food was provided ad lib. On average, mice in the control group consumed 14.9 kcal/day (or 3.9 g/day), Our experimental FMD diet is based on a nutritional screen that identified ingredients allowing high nourishment during periods of low calorie consumption (Brandhorst, Wei et al., 2013. Exp Gerontol. 2013 Oct;48(10): 1120-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exger.2013.02.016. Epub 2013 Feb 21). Prior to supplying the FMD diet, animals were transferred into fresh cages to avoid feeding on residual chow and coprophagy. The FMD diet consists of two different components designated as day 1 diet and day 2-4 diet that were fed in this order, respectively. The day 1 diet contains 1.88 kcal/g and was designed to adapt the mouse to a period of low caloric intake during the subsequent feeding days. The day 2-4 diet is identical on all feeding days and contains 0.36 kcal/g. The day 1 and days 2-4 diets were fed as the average intake (~4 g) of the ad lib fed control group every two weeks. Due to the different caloric densities of the supplied FMD diet, mice in this cohort had a -50% reduction in consumed calories on day 1 and consumed 9.7% of the control cohort on days 2 to 4. Mice consumed all the supplied food on each day of the FMD regimen and showed no signs of food aversion. After the end of the day 2-4 diet, we supplied TD.7912 chow ad lib for 10 days before starting another FMD cycle. [0058] Figures 2A-C provide experimental results showing induced stress resistance in mice. In these experiments, 12 week old female C57BL/6 mice were divided in the following experimental groups; ad lib (ad libitum feeding), STS/FMD, DXR, STS/FMD + DXR (Fig. 2). In order to observe the response to every treatment in presence or not of rapamycin, each group was present as duplicate but only one underwent rapamycin treatment. The administration of rapamycin was performed for a period of 14 days at the end of which a high dose of doxorubicin was administrated iv (24 mg/kg/). The animals belonging to the STS + DXR groups were fed a very low calorie and no protein FMD for 48h prior the injection of doxorubicin. Following doxorubicin injection the animal were monitored every day and the survival was recorded (Fig.2). Figure 2 A provides the treatment schedule for this stress resistance experiment. Figure 2B provides the survival data at day 20. Figure 2C provides a plot of the blood glucose levels for each of the experimental groups. It is also observed that the administration of rapamycin during chemotherapy sensitizes the mice to the drug leading to an increased mortality. However the experiment of Figure 2B show that STS can reverse the sensitization of normal tissue to chemotherapy induced by rapamycin. Cancer Related Experiments [0059] A mTOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin in combination with STS and with the chemotherapy drugs was administered to an animal, human subject or cancer cells to retard cancer growth and improve the survival. The chemotherapy drugs tested were the anthracycline doxorubicin alone or in a mix with two other chemo-drugs, topotecan and vincristine (TVD), which are commonly used to treat adult and children with cancer. [0060] Figures 3A-B provide results for experiments in which the efficacy of STS in combination with rapamycin in reducing tumor growth were tested in vitro on human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), murine breast cancer (4T1) and murine melanoma (B16) cell lines. Figure 3A provides plots of the cell viability for human neuroblastoma cell lines treated with rapamycin and the chemotherapy drug cocktail TVD (topotecan + vincristine + doxorubicin) under ad lib feeding or STS conditions. Figure 3B provides plots of the cell viability for a breast cancer (4T1) cell line treated with rapamycin and the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DXR) under ad lib feeding or STS conditions. Figure 3B provides plots of the cell viability for a melanoma (B16) cell line treated with rapamycin and the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DXR) under ad lib feeding or STS conditions. In each of these experiments, the cell viability was determined by Trypan blue staining for all the cell line tested and the effectiveness of each treatment on viability was determined by performing Student t-test (p-value<0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 are indicated as *, *, and respectively). The results show that short term starvation (STS) augments the efficacy of rapamycin and chemotherapy in reducing cell viability in multiple cancer cell lines. [0061] In a murine breast cancer (4T1) and murine melanoma (B16) mouse allograft models, it is demonstrated that STS and rapamycin have an additive effect in reducing tumor progression, which confirms that STS potentiates the effects of the mTOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin on cancer cells. Figures 4A-E provide the results of tumor progression studies. Figure 4A provides the timeline for the indicating the schedule indicating the schedule for the tumor progression studies involving a reduced caloric diet and rapamycin. In general, Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously with 2xl05 4T1 or B16 cells respectively. Once the tumor was palpable, the mice were grouped and underwent multiple cycles of STS combined with DXR administration. Figure 4B provides a plot of the tumor volume versus time for a 4T1 murine breast cancer model in Balb/c mice treated rapamycin and multiple cycles of STS (Shaded bar in A) combined with DXR administration. Figure 4C is a bar chart indicating tumor volume at the end of the experiment in Figure 4B. Figure 4D provides a plot of the tumor volume versus time for a murine melanoma model in C57BL/6 mice treated rapamycin and multiple cycles of STS combined with DXR administration. Figure 4E is a bar chart indicating tumor volume at the end of the experiment in Figure 4D. One-way ANOVA analysis was performed to determine the significance of the tumor size differences and the effectiveness of the treatment tested (p-value<0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 are indicated as *, *, and respectively). For the 4T1 murine breast cancer model, female Balb/c mice were injected subcutaneously s.c. in the right flank with 2xl05 4T1 cancer cells and ad lib fed with standard diet until the tumor was palpable. For our B16 murine melanoma model, female C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously s.c. in the right flank with 2xl05 B16 cancer cells and ad lib fed with standard diet until the tumor was palpable. At this point the tumor volume was determined and the mice were arranged in the following experimental groups; ad lib (ad libitum feeding), STS/FMD, DXR, STS/FMD + DXR. In order to observe the response to every treatment in presence or not of rapamycin, each group was present as duplicate but only one underwent rapamycin treatment. The mice were subject to a daily injection of rapamycin and to a multi-cycle treatment (for a total of three) where each cycle was composed as follows: mice belonging to the STS/FMD and STS/FMD + DXR groups underwent 48 to 72h of complete food deprivation with free access to water and then re-fed with standard chow diet for -10 days between cycles to recover the bodyweight lost. The animals from the STS/FMD + DXR group were also injected intravenously with Doxorubicin at the end of the first, second and third cycle respectively. The animals from DXR group were ad lib fed and injected with Doxorubicin as well. The experiments show that fasting enhances the effect of rapamycin in decreasing tumor progression. [0062] In summary, the combination of STS/FMD with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin has additive effects in retarding the growth and survival of a wide variety of cancer cells and tumors. This combined treatment also prevents the chemotherapy-dependent sensitization of normal cells caused by the administration of rapamycin alone. The results suggest that STS/FMD can potentiate the effect of other inhibitors of nutrient signaling pathways including the AKT-TOR-S6K and Ras- cAMP-PKA and MAPK. Because of the wide/broad acting effect of STS or the equivalent FMD on a variety of molecules, growth factors and nutrients outside and inside of cells, the potentiating effect observed with rapamycin is expected to apply to many different kinase/growth inhibitors used in cancer treatment. Because rapamycin and many other kinase and/or growth inhibitors are widely used for the treatment of certain tumors in humans, these results have important implications for the safety and efficacy of those therapies.
