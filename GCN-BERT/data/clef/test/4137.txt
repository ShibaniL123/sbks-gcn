RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority to the U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/992,123, filed on May 12, 2014, by Payne et al. and entitled “CURCUMIN-PEPTIDE CONJUGATES AND FORMULATIONS THEREOF,” the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, including the drawings. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is in the field of formulations of nutraceuticals, and more specifically, in the field of formulations having bioavailable curcuminoids. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE Turmeric is a curry spice obtained from the rhizome of Curcuma longa of the ginger family, and has a long history of use in ayurvedic medicine and in traditional Asian diets. The principal bioactive component of turmeric is curcumin (1,7-bis[4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl]-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione), a yellow pigment first identified in 1910. Curcumin is used widely in the United States for food coloring (e.g, in mustard, cheese, spices, cereals, potato flakes, soups, pickles, ice cream, and yogurt), and also as a nutraceutical. Recently, Curcumin has become a focus of pharmaceutical development. A June 2011 report stated that 61 clinical trials registered with the U.S. National Institutes of Health were completed or underway on the use of dietary curcumin in treating a variety of clinical disorders. Commercial curcumin contains curcumin itself (77%), desmethoxycurcumin (DMC, 17%) and bisdesmethoxycurcumin (BDMC, 3%); the latter two differ from curcumin only by lacking one or both methoxy groups, respectively. As a group these compounds and their derivatives for pharmaceutical use are referred to as curcuminoids. Among the major cellular metabolites of these three compounds are the tetrahydrocurcuminoids, in which both vinylidene groups are reduced, i.e., THC (tetrahydrocurcumin), TDMC (tetrahydrodesmethoxycurcumin) and TBDMC (tetrahydrobisdesmethoxycurcumin). The tetrahydrocurcuminoids retain the bioactivity but are colorless and more chemically stable than the curcuminoids. Curcumin's medicinal properties include reported effects that are antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal, antiteratogenic, antiproliferative and antimetaststic, and it is safe for human consumption even at the level of 8 g/day ingestion for sustained periods. Studies have shown that to varying degrees curcumin promotes wound healing and has therapeutic and or preventive effects against diabetes, asthma, allergies, cataracts, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, myelodysplastic syndromes, cystic fibrosis, myocardial infarctions, high cholesterol, stroke, malaria, HIV, HSV-1, psoriasis, and others. Among the diseases for which curcumin has ameliorative effects are autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, and several types of cancer. Medicinal use of curcumin has been limited because the compound is virtually insoluble (dissolution of only ca. 600 ng/mL) in water at acidic and physiological pH and hydrolyzes rapidly at alkaline pH. Plasma concentrations from high human oral doses (8-12 g/day) of curcumin are just in the nanomolar range. Most therapeutic in vitro studies on curcumin have solubilized it in organic solvents. Those solvents include dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), acetone and ethanol but they have limited suitability for in vivo studies themselves. Curcumin's poor solubility decreases its bioavailability throughout the body, and specifically at the brain, where curcumin does not readily cross the brain-blood barrier. Consequently, there is an ongoing need for methods and processes that enhance curcumin's bioavailability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Disclosed here are compositions comprising a curcuminoid-peptide complex. Also disclosed are methods of preparing a curcuminoid-peptide complex, comprising obtaining a curcuminoid; obtaining a peptide; and mixing the curcuminoid and the peptide in a solvent. Also disclosed are methods of treating a subject, the method comprising identifying a subject in need of treatment of a curcumin-related disorder, and administering to the subject a nutraceutical composition comprising a curcuminoid-peptide complex as described. Also disclosed are therapeutic compositions comprising a curcuminoid-peptide complex as described and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, or carrier. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a photograph of a gel electrophoresis experiment showing curcumin is bound to whey protein. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS The present inventors have discovered that the ingestion of a curcumin-peptide complex significantly increases the serum bioavailability of curcumin as compared to the ingestion of uncomplexed curcumin. Thus, in one aspect, disclosed herein are curcuminoid-peptide complexes comprising a curcuminoid compound linked to a peptide compound. By “peptide” in the context of a “peptide compound” or a “peptide complex” it is meant a compound composed of one or more amino acids. When the peptide has more than one amino acids, the peptide has at least two amino acids linked together by a peptide bond. In some embodiments, the peptide comprises any of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, or modified amino acids. In certain embodiments, the compound is an oligopeptide, for example a bipeptide, having two amino acids, a tripeptide, having three amino acids, a 4-mer, 5-mer, and the like. In some embodiments, the oligopeptide comprises between 2-20 amino acids. In other embodiments, the peptide compound is a polypeptide having between 21-100 amino acids. By “N-mer,” where N is an integer, it is meant an oligo- or polypeptide having N amino acids. In other embodiments, the peptide compound is a protein or a protein fragment. In some embodiments, a protein is naturally occurring and is a full sequence polypeptide expressed by a cell. In other embodiments, a protein is a synthetic protein having a sequence that is not found in nature. In some embodiments, the synthetic protein is expressed by a cell using recombinant technologies, whereas in other embodiments, the synthetic protein is synthesized using a peptide synthesizer. A protein fragment is an oligo- or polypeptide having a sequence identical to a sequence fragment found in a protein. All amino acids, proteins, or peptides within the scope of the present disclosure and claims may be either artificially or naturally occurring or have any forms of modifications (chemical or enzymatic post translational). In some embodiments, the curcuminoid compound is bound to the peptide compound to form the complex. In these embodiments, the curcuminoid compound is either bound directly to an amino acid of the peptide, or is bound through a linker compound. In some embodiments, the linker is an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl moiety, which may be substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of —OH, —SH, —COOH, —N—C(O)H, —N—C(O)OH, —C(O)NH, and the like. In some embodiment, the linker is bound to the amino acid or the curcuminoid compound through a substituent. In other embodiments, the curcuminoid compound is linked by hydrogen bonding to the peptide compound to form the complex. In yet other embodiments, the curcuminoid compound is linked by electrostatic forces to the peptide compound to form the complex. In yet other embodiments, the curcuminoid compound is linked by lipophilic interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces, or pi stacking) to the peptide compound to form the complex. In other embodiments, the curcuminoid compound is linked by covalent bonding to the peptide compound to form the complex. In some embodiments, the peptide is a full-length protein. In certain embodiments, the protein is one that is found in the serum of a mammal. In other embodiments, the protein is derived from an animal source other than a mammal. In some of these embodiments, the protein is derived from an avian source, for example an egg protein. In still other embodiment, the protein is derived from plants, such as grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, vegetables, and the like. In some embodiments, the protein is obtained from whey, rice, pea, flaxseed, soy bean, egg. In some embodiments, the protein is albumin. In other embodiments, the peptide comprises cysteine or tyrosine. In certain embodiments, the peptide is N-acetyl cysteine. In certain embodiments, only a single amino acid, for example, cysteine or tyrosine, is used. In some embodiments, the protein obtained from natural sources is not an isolated and purified protein. Instead, the protein is a mixture of various proteins that are isolated together. These proteins are the isolates of the particular source. Thus, for example, whey protein isolate (WPI) is the mixture of isolated proteins obtained from whey, whereas rice protein isolate (RPI) is the mixture of isolated proteins obtained from rice. Those of ordinary skill in the art know how to obtain protein isolates, for example WPI. Throughout the present disclosure, the terms “whey protein,” “whey protein isolate,” and “WPI” are used interchangeably. Examples of oligo- and polypeptides and full-length proteins used in the complexes described herein include, but are not limited to whey protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α); cyclooxygenase (COX) (including COX-1 and COX-2); α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) (also known as orosomucoid); myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2); any one of the group of enzymes called histone acetyl-transferases (HATs), such as p300/CBP; any one of the group of enzymes called histone deacetylases (HDAC); glyoxalase I (GLOI); xanthine oxidase (XO); a proteasome; sarco (endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA); human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease; any one of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), for example DNMT1; DNA polymerase (pol) λ; any one of the ribonucleases (RNases), for example RNase A; any one of the lipoxygenases (LOXs); any one of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); lysozyme; any one of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of enzymes; cellular sarcoma (c-Src); glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β; ErbB2; phosphorylase kinase; any one of the protein reductases, for example thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and aldose reductase (ALR2); thioredoxin reductase; any one of the caseins; human serum albumin (HSA); bovine serum albumin (BSA); fibrinogen; β-lactoglobulin (β-LG); α-lactalbumin; human serum immunoglobulin (Ig); FtsZ; transthyretin (TTR); glutathione (GSH); and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). In some embodiments, the curcuminoid-peptide complex is a complex of curcumin and whey protein isolate (WPI). In certain embodiments, the WPI is a milk-derived whey protein. Milk whey protein is a mixture of β-lactoglobulin (˜65%), α-lactalbumin (˜25%), bovine serum albumin (˜8%), and immunoglobulins. In some of these embodiments, the complex is formed by mixing the curcumin and the WPI in ethanol. Thus, in these embodiments, there is no covalent linkage between the curcumin and the WPI. However, in other embodiments, the curcumin and the WPI form a covalent bond. In certain embodiments, the ratio of curcumin to WPI is 1:1 w/w (mg of curcumin:g of WPI). In other embodiments the ratio of curcumin:WPI is 1:≦10 w/w (mg:g). In still other embodiments the ratio of curcumin:WPI is 10:≦1 w/w (mg:g). In certain embodiments the ratio of curcumin:WPI is 25:1 w/w (mg:g). In other embodiments the ratio of curcumin:WPI is 1:50 w/w (mg:g). In some embodiments, the WPI is obtained from a commercially available source, which comprises 85% WPI in the available powder. In some embodiments, the curcumin is obtained from a commercially available source, which comprises 95% curcumin in the available powder. In another aspect, disclosed herein is a nutraceutical composition comprising a curcuminoid-peptide complex, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. The term “carrier” defines a chemical compound that facilitates the incorporation of a compound into cells or tissues. For example dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a commonly utilized carrier as it facilitates the uptake of many organic compounds into the cells or tissues of an organism. A common carrier is water, where an aqueous solution of the product of interest is prepared and administered to a subject. The term “diluent” defines chemical compounds diluted in water that will dissolve the compound of interest as well as stabilize the biologically active form of the compound. Salts dissolved in buffered solutions are utilized as diluents in the art. One commonly used buffered solution is phosphate buffered saline because it mimics the salt conditions of human blood. Since buffer salts can control the pH of a solution at low concentrations, a buffered diluent rarely modifies the biological activity of a compound. In certain embodiments, the same substance can act as a carrier, diluent, or excipient, or have any of the two roles, or have all three roles. Thus, a single additive to the therapeutic composition can have multiple functions. The term “physiologically acceptable” defines a carrier or diluent that does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the compound. The therapeutic compositions disclosed herein may be manufactured in a manner that is itself known, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, drying, encapsulating, entrapping or tabletting processes. The therapeutic compositions disclosed herein thus may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the curcuminoid-peptide complex into preparations which can be used nutraceutically. Any of the well-known techniques, carriers, and excipients may be used as suitable and as understood in the art; e.g., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, above. For oral administration, the curcuminoid-peptide complex can be formulated readily by combining the curcuminoid-peptide complex with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the presently disclosed complexes to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject. The therapeutic preparations for oral use can be obtained by mixing one or more solid excipient with the disclosed curcuminoid-peptide complexex, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. The therapeutic preparations that can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. The therapeutic compositions suitable for use in the methods disclosed herein include compositions where the curcuminoid-peptide complex is contained in an amount effective to achieve its intended purpose. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of the curcuminoid-peptide complex effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated. Typically, the dose range of the curcumin administered to the patient is from about 0.5 to 1000 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. The dosage may be a single one or a series of two or more given in the course of one or more days, as is needed by the patient. In some embodiments, the dosages is between 0.1 mg to 50 mg. In other embodiments, the dosage is between 1 mg to 30 mg. Other dose ranges include between 10 to 50 mg, between 20 to 50 mg, between 30 to 50 mg, between 40 to 50 mg, between 20 to 40 mg, between 10 to 20 mg, between 10 to 30 mg, between 20 to 30 mg, and between 30 to 40 mg. The dose may also be at 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, or 50 mg. In another aspect, disclosed herein is a method of treating a curcumin-related disorder, the method comprising identifying a subject in need thereof and administering to the subject a therapeutically effect amount of a curcuminoid-peptide complex as disclosed herein. The term “subject” refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, who is the object of treatment, observation or experiment. The mammal may be selected from the group consisting of mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, cats, sheep, goats, cows, primates, such as monkeys, chimpanzees, and apes, and humans. The term “therapeutically effective amount” is used to indicate an amount of the curcuminoid-peptide complex that elicits the biological or medicinal response indicated. This response may occur in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, and includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease being treated. The term “treat,” “treating,” “treatment,” or any other variation thereof, does not indicate the complete cure from a disorder. Any amelioration of alleviation of the symptoms of a diseases or disorder to any degree, or any increase in the comfort of the subject, is considered treatment. In another aspect, disclosed herein is a method of treating a curcumin-related disorder, the method comprising identifying a subject in need thereof and administering to the subject a therapeutically effect amount of a curcuminoid-peptide complex as disclosed herein, where subsequent to the administration, the serum Cmax of curcumin is <500 ng/mL. In some embodiments, the serum Cmax of curcumin is <0.001% of the administered dose of curcumin. A “curcumin-related disorder” is a disorder that has been shown to be ameliorated by the administration of curcumin or a curcuminoid compound to the subject. Examples of curcumin-related disorders include, but are not limited to, diabetes, asthma, allergies, cataracts, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, myelodysplastic syndromes, cystic fibrosis, myocardial infarctions, high cholesterol, stroke, malaria, HIV, HSV-1, psoriasis, and others. Among the diseases for which curcumin has ameliorative effects are autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, and several types of cancer. The definition of the pharmacokinetic parameter Cmax is well-known to those of skill in the art. Briefly, Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration after a dosage administration. In another aspect, disclosed herein is a method of preparing a curcuminoid-peptide complex, as described above, the method comprising obtaining a curcuminoid; obtaining a peptide; and mixing the curcuminoid and the peptide in a solvent. In some embodiments, the solvent is a polar solvent, while in other embodiments, the solvent is an apolar solvent. In some embodiments, the polar solvent is water, whereas in other embodiments, the polar solvent is an alcohol. In some embodiments, the alcohol is ethanol. In other embodiments, the solvent is an alkaline solution. In these embodiments, curcumin is solubilized in the alkaline solution, and then the protein is added. The solution is then made acidic prior to drying the curcumin-protein mixture. EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of Curcumin-Whey Protein Isolate Complex A curcumin-WPI complex was prepared for administration to human subjects. The following materials were used: WPI: 85% protein by weightCurcumin powder: 95% curcuminoidsEthanol: 100% ethyl alcohol Ratio of Curcumin:WPI of 1:50 w/w. A 0.5% w/v tincture (solution) was prepared by mixing 5 g curcumin powder with 1000 mL ethanol. The mixture was placed on a magnetic stirring hot plate, with a speed setting at medium, and temperature setting at 50° C. for 30 minutes or until solution turned clear. To the resulting solution was added 250 g WPI powder. The mixture was placed on a rotary evaporator (rotovap) at slow speed (20-30 rpm), having a water bath temperature of 50° C., and low vacuum for 30 minutes, or until 90% of the ethanol was evaporated. The resulting mixture was placed in a kiln oven to remove the remainder of the ethanol. Alternatively, the mixture was placed in a lyophilizer, or alternatively, was placed in a flow hood or left to air dry. The curcumin/WPI complex is a fluffy powder with an opaque color in the yellow to orange range. In contrast to pure curcumin, the curcumin:WPI complex powder mixes freely with water, forming a suspension. The curcumin:WPI powder can be easily cleaned from glass, plastic and metal surfaces with detergent. The curcumin:WPI complex only minimally stains clothing. Vigorous washing with detergent solutions is usually sufficient to remove staining. Ratio of Curcumin:WPI of 25:1 w/w (mg:g). The above procedure was repeated, except with 25 mg curcumin powder and 1 g WPI powder. A similar product was obtained. A standard SDS-PAGE gel of the curcumin:WPI complex was run to determine whether the curcumin was bound to the protein. FIG. 1 shows the resulting gel. This gel was viewed under UV after electrophoresis without fixing or staining. The stain seen in lanes 6-8 is the result of the curcumin staining of the WPI. The lane marked M is the molecular weight marker, which has three fluorescent bands running at 75, 50 and 25 kD. Lane 1-8 correspond to the curcumin:WPI complex at 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 micrograms of the curcumin:WPI sample, respectively. As can be seen from lanes 6-8, the curcumin is complexed with the WPI. For lanes 1-5, either there is not enough curcumin for visualization or the curcumin is removed by the treatment with SDS-PAGE lysis buffer, heating, or other steps in the procedure. Example 2 Preparation of curcumin-Amino Acid Complexes Following the method of Example 1, curcumin was dissolved in 95% ethanol, followed by the addition of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). An escalating ratio of the concentrations of curcumin to n-acetyl cysteine was used to find the saturation level. The optimal concentration was found at around 100 mg of curcumin to 1000 mg of NAC in a 0.5% (w/v) solution of curcumin in ethanol. Optimal concentration was noted when low number of Curcumin crystal formation was observed in the macroscopic field. Similarly, curcumin was dissolved in 95% ethanol, followed by the addition of cysteine. An escalating ratio of the concentrations of curcumin to cysteine was used to find the saturation level. The optimal concentration was found at around 100 mg of curcumin to 1000 mg of cysteine in a 0.5% (w/v) solution of curcumin in ethanol. Optimal concentration was noted when low number of Curcumin crystal formation was observed in the macroscopic field. Further, a healthy human volunteer subject was dosed with 1.8 grams of the cysteine-curcumin complex. The maximum measured blood concentration of the cysteine-curcumin complex was found to be 300 ng/mL. This compared with two dosing of the 25 mg/g curcumin:WPI complex (equivalent to 50 mg of curcumin), which resulted in a measured blood concentration of 70 ng/mL. In a similar experiment, curcumin was dissolved in 95% ethanol, followed by the addition of tyrosine. No binding of the curcumin to the tyrosine was observed. The curcumin solidified in a singular layer above the tyrosine layer. When observed under a microscope the tyrosine layer had no visual coloration and the curcumin crystals were completely separate from the tyrosine. Example 3 Administration of Curcumin:WPI Complex Two healthy individuals were administered a single dose of the curcumin:WPI complex, having a ratio of curcumin:WPI of 25:1 w/w (mg:g). The dosage contained 25 mg of curcumin. Blood was drawn from each individual at 20 min, 50 min, and 90 min, and the level of serum curcumin was calculated. The results are shown in Table 1, below.
