lO 3o This invention relates to an improved method of distillation particularly for use in the refining of the crude cil obtained from tar sands, such as are found in the province of Alberta, Canada, and elsewhere, but which may also be used in the petroleum industry generally. " ' As this process is particularly for refining the crude cil obtained from tar sands, it will be so described herein for the sake of convenience but it will be understood that it may be used for the refining of any crude cil. One known process for tar sands crude cil consists essentially in mixing the crude sand cil from the standard hot water Washing process which usually leaves a p oentà B of minerals in the crude, with 50% of the actual cil in the wet crude of a light distillation to reduce both the gravity and viscosity of the cil. It is then passed through a continuous settler where considerable mineral matter and water is settled out. As the overflow contains about 50% of water, it is pumped through aheater where the water present is converted into steam. The resulting stesm-oil foam is separated into practically dry cil and steam in a steam separator. The refining itself in said known process consists in heating the dry dilute crude cil to 825°F. and flashing it in a flash chamber, the vapors from which are passed into a fractionating column. The resulting distillates are combined and used for diluting the wet crude cil, while the bottoms from the flash chamber and column are used as fuel. There is always some difficulty in establishing conditions in the refinery that result in recovery of ai1 the distillates added to the crude along with enough new distillate to cause the supply to build up and yet have a bottom product that is not too heavy to handle in the piping and pumping system used° The treatment of the heavy cil so that it will flow through pipe lines is of major importance for the economic utilization of ideal i lO th Albe2ta tar sands deposits. The well-known fluidized coking process has so far been the only step in the right direction, but it has many disadvantages such as, for example, the disposal problem of large amounts of very hot sand, high maintenance costs, high capital investment for plant, the inability to accurately and evenly control dissociation temperature throughout a large volume of fluidized sand, the presence of catalizer poisons in the coker distillate, and last but not least, in that it is limited to the production of only one major product which, even after mild hydrogenatïon, is still not pure enough to serve properly as charging stock for catalytic cracking into gasoline, as toomany catalizer poisons remain in it. The present method or process comprises essentially superheating a natural gas that will quickly dissolve in etude cil. The expression "natural gas" is intended to include casing head gas, wet or dry, refinery gases and/or carbon dioxide. Although any suitable gas may be used, it is preferable to use one that will act as a solventïn the crude cil. The superheated gas is mixed with the crude cil in order almost instantaneously te raise the temperature thereof and te reduce its viscosity. This heated cil is sprayed together with superheated steam under pressure into a separator where flash equilibrium and steam distillate takes place. All or any desired percentage of volatile hydrocarbons may be vaporized, and this is controlled by the temperature of the cil and the quantity and superheat of the steam used. The control may be such that distillation takes place without any chemical chance in the volatile hydrocarbons, that is, without gas, asphalt or coke formation, or there maybe mild cracking or c0 mp1 comp te any desired extent. In the petroleum industry, distillation is regarded as the most important refining process. Essentially, the fluidízed cokíng process which has been proposed for tar sand cil, is a distillation process lO 6144i:6 which takes place under dissociation equilibrium conditions, so that chemical work in addition to purely physical work, is performed at the same time. General refinery practice is approximately as follows: Crude cil is pumped first through a heat exchange system at a pump pressure of 125 to 200 psì and then through a tube still. The tube still consists of bundles of special alloy tubes arranged in an insulated firebox to receive convection and radiant heat from burning fuel. In the tubes the moving cil is heated to a definite temperature. The hot cil is flashed into the vaporizer section of a fractionating column. Steam is frequently added in the column to lower the boiling point. This method of vaporization possesses a number of advantages that accrue from the contact of vapor and liquid. When a liquid mixture heated under pressure is flashed by pressure drop, the vapor produced acts as an inert gas and tends tovaporize the liquid as steam in steam distillation. This is flash eqtùlibrium vaporization. The result is a lowered boiling point, less thermal decomposition, an recovery of higher boiling compounds of the crude cil. Efficiency and economy are absolutely essential in refining crude cil obtained from tar sands. A most important feature of the present invention is the first step which consists of preheating the crude cil. In the past, it has not been possible to do this in a practical and economical manner. The fluidized coking process, for example, is forced to use cil at the outside temperature, though it is clearly undesirable from the viewpoint of economy and thermodynamics. For this heating step, I superheat a suitable natural gas which will quickly dissolve in crude cil. Such a gas may be casing head gas, wet or dry, refinery gases, or carbon dioxide. This superheated natural gas is intimately mixed with the crude cil. It has been found that the amount of any one gas held in solution in any one crude cil, Y k while following Heroeyfs law, must be determined by experiment for each particular crude oil and each particular gas, since such solubilities net only differ greatly for different types of gases, but also differ between gases of the same type, and even much more greatly between different types of oil. The amount of any gas held in solution in a lìquid is dependent upon pressure and temperature, as stated in Henry's law. A given quantity of liquid will dissolve at constant temperature quantities (by weight) of the gas which are proportiona! to the pressure of the gas. Thus, with increasìng presstu-es, proportionately larger quantities of gas wíll be held in solution. As already stated, the solubility of natural gas in any tar sand oil is dependent upon the nature of the oil used as a solvent, and the solubility factor must be experimentally determined for any particular tar sand oil in conjunction with the particular natural gas which will be used. Henry's law, previously given, indicates that change of temperature as well as change of pressure, affects the solubility of a gas in liquid. Other conditions remaining constant, the quantity of gas that will dissolve in tar sand oil depends upon the temperature. As the temperature increases, the amount of gas that can be dissolved in the oil decreases but, even at the higher temperatures, large quantities of gas will dissolve in the oil. What has been said regarding the solubility of gas in tar sand crude, also applies generally to its major products or fractions, although here it may be changed by the presence of other products. The greatest single effect of dissolving hot natural gas under high pressure in tar sand cil is a great decrease in viscosity, which is so great that it permits in a following step almost ideal heat transfer from steam to the oil, which is not obtainable under any other conditions. i0 61441:6 A general or total process consisting of a succession of process steps for producing marketable petroleum products from tar sands would not have much chance to be competitive with the standard petroleum products made from crudes that come from cil wells, unless the utmost economy is practised. Economy here not only includes investment costs, which must be kept very much lower than has heretofore been thought possible, but furthermore, each process step must be thermodynamically sound, that is, it must be made as nearly completely reversible as possible. Maintenance costs must be kept very low too. These are among the objects of my process. Undoubtedly the greatest single problem that has to do with the treatment of tar sa à cil for the above purposes resides in heat transfer. Crude tar subsoils are se viscous and at present still so full of mineral impurities that they would not possibly be heated in pipe stills« And heated to a high temperature they must be, and this furthermore in such a way that no undesirable cracking takes place. In my preferred practice, I heat the tar sand cil which is either to be distilled only or else dissociated to IO° or 12CF. below the atomizing temperature which as a maximum is the boiling point of the highest boiling constituent of th@ mixture at its partial pressure, although it may, of course, be less if correspondingly more steam is used for atomizing. There is no way impracticably available of doing r this, other than the way I have developed. Before dissolving the natural gas in the cil I heat it first to a suitably high temperature in a suitable superheater, following which the hot gas is dissolved in predetermined amounts in the cil in any convenient manner in one or more steps. For all or part of the solution step I preferably employ a high pressure absorber which consists essentially of a slotted cylinder suitably mounted within a solid casing and rotating at high speed. The centrifugal force resulting from this rotation causes the cil to pass outwards at considerable velocity through narrow slots formed in the cylinder wall. Intimate contact between liquid and gas is the result. There are two effects: First, the cil is sheared as it passes through the slots, and second, the layers of liquid emerging from these slots cause the major shearing in contacïng the relatively slower moving mass of the liquid outside the drum in the absorber. Conditions of extreme turbulence are produced and intimate contact between cil and gas is attained and maintained. In the preferred practice of the invention, the absorber will be so dimensioned and designed that despite the original high viscosity of cold tar sand cil, the viscosity will be sufficiently decreased in a matter of seconds from heating and gas absorption to make it suitable for being dispersed in a two-fluid nozzle. There is nothing particularly new in the construction and operation of such gas absorbers; what is new is my process step of preheating the gas under pressure prior to absorption in the cil, so as to heat the cil and make the resulting hot solution of natural gas in tar sand cil correspondingly much less viscous, thus saving in power, and using such absorbera under my process conditions as an essential and indispensable step in the distillation of tar sand and/ or any other very heavy cil, such as a lO°B ' crude. Instead of heating and diluting the cil in a single step, as described above, I may accomplish this in two steps. I may direct the superheated natural gas and the crude cil through a two-fluid nozzle before directing the mixture to the high pressure absorber. Some information concerning the solubility of natural gas in tar sand cil may be gained from the book entitled "Increasing the Recovery of Petroleum" by Wentworth H. Osgood (first volume) publìshed by McGraw-Hill Co., of New York. The author gives solubility data for I certain crudes from wells. Some curses are shown for pressures ranging from i00 to I000 psi, showing the gas absorption in cubic feet per barrel. The crudes referred to are much lighter than tar sand cil. No high temperatures are mentioned in the book. However, the heating of natural gas to high temperatures and creating suitable pressures for the purpose of heating and reducing the viscosity of crude cil is novel. As previously stated, the solubility of natural gas in cil depends in a high degree on the nature of the particular cil which is to b e processed, and on the solubility of the gas itself. Both of these factors must be determined in the laboratory. When the coefficient cf solubility of the gas in cil has been determined for cOo. and 760 mm, or one atmosphere, it is possible te apply Henry's law te ascertain the amount which will be dissolved at any stated higher pressure. It will give approximately correct results, although it does not hold entirely good. Yet it is possible to correct for any éther temperature, for which the total solubïlïty will be reduced. The figure obtained for the solubility of a given natural ) as in a particular tar sand cil at X atmosphere pressure and at Y° absolute temperature will hold good for a saturated solution which is unable to absorb any more at that temperature without an increase in pressure. It follows that if at the same temperature and pressure, less gas is brought together with the cil than would saturate it, the whole of the gas would be absorbed, without leaving any gas residue. The solution at that temperature and pressure would be unsaturated, but the use of unsaturated solutions is desirable for it makes for safety, and avoids complications in the plant and in operation. Another point te be taken into consideration is that it will very often be economical enough to use gas-oil solutions in later process steps, for instance, for flash-equilibrium distillation with superheated lO 61441 6 steam at temperatures where the heavy cil has very little, if any, vapor pressure of its o wn, which is always the case when the solution is made way below the boiling points of the cil constituents, which are high, and raised still higher by the pressure at which the solution is made. For high solution temperatures, however, regardless of high pressure, the vapor pressure of the cil can no longer be neglected9 and the total pressure becomes the sum of the partial pressloees, that is the partial pressure of the cil vapor and the partial pressure of the gas. In such a case correspondingly higher gas pressures have to be used in order to get the same amount of gas into solution as heretofore. It is entirely possible that in some instances compressors may have to be employed within the scope of my invention, instead of using pipe line pressures direct or after reduction by expansion in valves. The crude cil is now heated and fluid enough for distillation. During distillation according tothe present process, two chemically completely different czd results are obtained: in the first one, the chemical constitution of the distiì1 ing hydrocarbonés remains what it was before and no deleterious chemïoål changes take place during distillation. In the second one, distillation is combined with thermal conversion! here distillation under my special conditions produces the required vapor phase from the liquid phase by flashing, and additional extremely high temperature steam alters the chemical constitution of the hydrocarbons in the vapor mixture in a way that maybe accurately predetermined by the methods of chemical thermodynamics. In other words, it is possible now to determine the required dissociation constants for the hydrocarbons which are to be converted into other and more valuable hydrocarbons. On the basis of the dissociation constant, dissociation equilibria may be determined for any temperature° The deciding factor is the absolute tèmperature to which the vapor phase hydrocarbons are subjected. The whole process is practically instantaneous and so rapid that both vaporization and thermal cemversion take place continuously and practically simultaneously and may be completed in less than one second. The products are then separated in any suitable manner, such as by condensation. Such thermal conversion may be used in place of fluidized coking, to obtain the same and better results in a simpler, cheaper and much more practical way. My process may be employed for the treatment of cil fractions or cuts as well as for the crude tar sand cil itself, or for that matter a crude cil or fractions or cuts therefrom may be treated. But the prìncipal object is to provide a basically new method which will do away with the limitations and disadvantages of all others that have been hitherto used or proposed. ) The preheated cil and superheated steam are sprayed together, resulting in an instantaneous vaporizing of the cil by direct and continuous heat transfer. It may be stated here that although I prefer te preheat the cil in the manner :d so ìSed above, it is possible to use cold cil at this point, but the results are net nearly so satisfactory and it is doubtful whether it would' be economically feasible. The flashed cil and steam pass through a separator where a small percentage of the cll which does not Vaporize carries away any non-volatile residue. By control of the cil and steam ratio the percentage distilled can be regulated se that an unvaporized fraction and all solids are removed at the separator drain. The steam and cil vapors passing through the separator can then be fractionally condensed. As the cil is vaporized in contact wíth its own vapor, the complete benefits of flash equilibrium vaporization are realized. Furthermore, the steam acts as an inert gas to lower the boiling point and to supply sensible latent heat. j ) :1: ,. ...... 61441 6 - I0 - When the old methods of vaporization are used, the higher boiling fractions of the crude cil are decomposed at the high temperatures necessary for their vaporization. Cracking is appreciable at 650°F., and it has been observed that vigorous decomposition starts to take place at temperatures exceeding 710°F. A factor that cannot be neglected when considering thetemperature is the time that the cil is held at the higher temperature. For very short periods of time the heavier 0ils can be heated to higher temperatures without cracking. During my vaporizing step, there is no decomposition when the cil is heated to comparatively high temperatures because of the instantaneous direct heat transfer from the highly superheated steam to the innumerable particles of a most finely divided cil spray under conditions of great turbulence. This results in obtaining various ours or fractions commercially, completely unobtainable at present. The deciding factor here is the element of time, and the absence of higher wall temperatures as is the case with the prior processes, so that there is no catalysis. In the tube stills now in common use, solid coke is deposited because of the prolonged heating(of the cil film. As the coke is deposited, the temperature in the tube rises and more coke forms until the tube reaches thetemperature of the furnace or bursts. This results ,t in shut-down and replacement of expensive alloy tubes. Hea t ånsferç usually measured in BTU per square foot of heat transfer surface per hour per degree temperature difference. Under the conditions of my process it is large even pår second. The reason is this: If a cubic foot of tar sand crude oll could be subdivided into little globules of 0o001 mm each, then that one cubic foot of cil would expose 72,000 square feet to heat transfer from steam. I cannot do quite as well as that, but it is easy, according to my process, to subdivide it finely enough so that many thousands of square feet of heat transfer surface are exposed for each cubic foot of cil. - ll - It is quite easy, when you are dealing with a suitable gas solution in hot cil, to produce perfect atomization. This by itself results in excellent heat transfer, but the conditions under which it is done in my process increase the heat transfer surface enormously as follows: Each little globule of oil-gas solutìon that is sprayed is flashed separately into an envelope of steam which acts just like a vacuum. It literally explodes into that vacuum, and the vapor pressure of the dissolved gases, which expand, literally tears the cil globule, that was already small owing to fine atomization, into an infinite number of exceedingly small, substantially colloidal pieces. This subdivision process continues, until the smallest globules are simply aggregates of a number of cil molecules still held together by cohesion, and finally they appear, if the vapor is dry, saturated or superheated, in vapor form as individual molecules. If the vapor is wet, as it is made to be when it is intended to throw out az4y colloidal minerals (like catalyser poisons) that might be suspended in the vapor by centrifugal action in a separator, then, of course, the smallest particles of liquid phase hydrocarbonsI present ate multi-molecular aggregates. They condense at once aröund the colloidal mineral particles, thus forming much larger aggregates, which may be separated centrifugally, but by themselves the colloids could not. T mç must first have their mass sufficiently enlarged. I Another factor that helps to make heat transfer in my process actually instantaneous, is the fact that relative thermal conduotivities increase by the square root of the velocity. Heat transfer when twofluìd nozzles are used, takes place under conditions of very great turbulenceç and very high velocities, as can easily be shown when the mean velocity of flow is in centimeters per second, the other units being square entimeters per second and gram calories. Various tests by physìcists have shown that the specific conductance (or conductivity of transfer) varies approximately as the square root of the velocity of the fluid. 61441 6 4o By providing the means and the method of producing what might well be called infinitely large heat transfer surfaces between steam and cil instantaneously, I also make it possible to establish thermal equilibria instantaneously, and these may be purely thermal, like the equilibrium which we call vapor pressure between the cil and its vapor, or they may be chemical equilibria as are those in all processes of thermal conversion. The only thing which decides what kind ofv -"« «- --.- --, ' thermal or chemical, is going, to exist, is the energy state at the end of the operation, that is, when the fluid leaves the nozzle. And this energy state is under the absolute control of the operator who merely has to alter the relative quantities, the ratio of steam to cil, their respective temperatures and pressures according to what he wants to de. Thermodynamically it makes no difference how this final energy state is brought about, whether in a fraction of a second or in hours, whether in one step or many steps, the only thing that counts is the energy state of thé system at the beginning and at the end of the operation. However, where a long time is token, as it is ïn fluidized cokiv there are undesirable side-reactions, and losses. In process there are none, as it is so exceedingly rapid. Another advantage is that the oll "refining" plant can be so tied into the steam plant that most of the process heat can be used reversibly, that is recovered in the process of making steam° The principal advantages of my method of vaporization can be summarized as follows: I. Instantaneous heat transfer and vaporization, 2. Direct heat transfer, 3. Continuous operation, 4. Self-cleanly features..removal of sand. spended matter, anm non-voAa iAe components OEn e separator, 5Compactness of equipment, 6. flexibilité of operation, 7. Bafe operation, 8.

Precision control, 12. Any crude, including tar sands crude, yie squalitatively and quantitatively much more valuable products, many of which are commercially entirely new. A It is necessary for each different tar sand cil to determìne the optimum conditions for operating my process so that the ratio, lbs. steam/lb, cil, may be kept to a minimum. My method of vaporization can be considered as a combination of flash equilibrium distillation and steam distillation. The steam serves as a source of heat as well as an inert diluent gas to lower the boiling point. The cil vapor also acts as a diluent gas and effects a lowering of the boiling point. And, last but net least, the natural gas which is dissolved in the cil as described above lowers the boiling point still further. When the cil is heated and flashed at one temperature, a certain percentage of it is vaporized. Numerous flashings at different temperatures results in a flash vaporization curve when the temperature is plotted against the corresponding equilibrium flashes. Flash vaporization curves can be estimated from true boìling point curves or from distillations according to the standard of the American Sooi@ty of Testing Materials. Only two ways are available to reduce the boiling point! namely,i to lower the pressure (vacuum) or te introduce an inert or dissimilar gas, süch as steam. In both ica if e»b0 i1 ing point is reduced the same number of degrees F., the concentration of cil molecules per unit volume will be the same. Using Dalton's law and assuming the final pressure to p. » be 15 pounds par square inch, the ratio l a. stea f b.oeil m yobe calculated for various boiling points and various percentages ofr distillation. The results show that greater amounts of samare re lUoEreà as the boiling point is lowered. In addition, it will be found that with lower percentages of distillation, :lower boiling points can be used and small steam-to-oil ratios maintained. s already stated, the steam supplies the necessary sensible æd latent heat te vaporize the cil. The amount of steam required for this purpose will depend upon the thermal properties of the cil, the degree of cil preheat, and the percentage distilled, Also it depends upon the initial and final state of the steam° q 61 4 4 1 6 A careful investigation has indicated that the very desirable lower ratio Ibs. steam/lb, cil is favoured by the following conditions in the order of their relative importance: l. Higher oïl preheat Higher steam superheat 3. Lower steam pressure i0 Obviously, a lower boiling point, and a lower percentage distilled will reduce the ibs. steam/lb, cil ratio correspondingly, other conditions remaining constant. In accordance with the old axiom "The higher the temperature of heat reception, the greater the efficiency", and in my preferred practice I use the most highly superheated high pressure steam that can be made considering the available materials of construction for the superheater tubes. Generating and superheating:the steam to high temperatures under very high pressure leads to great savings in plant and operating costs, an item that is very important in connection with tar sand 0il refining. This high temperature - high pressure ate is then throttled down to the 'required operating pressure substantivai , . without loss of any heat, as illustrated in a graph hereinafter, referred to, prior to its use in my process as above described. At hindi superheat (say 1300°-I40Q°F. ) a wide range of pressures can be used, and I can still maintain a low ratio of steam to cil. Whatever the pressure may be during instantaneous heat transfer prior to the pressure drop which results in flashing, a low total pressure is desirable during vaporization, since back pressure would raise the boiling point of the cil. Where Feld scrubbers are used for rational condensation of the vapor mixture, a suitable back pressure would be atmospheric plus the few inches of water column required to overcome the resistance to flow set up by a battery of these scrubbers» It should be understood thai the same pound of steam that would IO lower the boiling point also provides a pound of steam for vaporizing the cil. Thus, the amount of steam required to lower the boiling point of an cil to a definite temperature and to a fixed percentage distilled is equal to the amount of steam required to vaporize the cil. Tar sand oils may vary considerably in their thermal properties, and not enough is known about them at present. However, I find that a steam-to-oil ratio of one and a half pounds of highly superheated steam to one pound of tar sand cil that is reasonably dry, results in making the cil fit for pipe lìne transporation, if that is the desired object for which my process was to be used. There are, of course, many other applications within the scope of my present invention, for which the steam-oil ratio would have to be higher, especially those involving the chemical work of endothermic reactions. When calculating the vapor pressures, partial pressures, and parts per million of cil by weight remaining at any time or anywhere in the system in the steam, it is best, because of the inevitable variations in the volatility of tar sand oils from different locations, to make a laboratory distillation of a der a high vacua, for inst ce under 0.2 mm pressure. The data e obtained then permits calculation of the vapor pressures, partial pressures and parts permillion of cil remaining in the steam as a function @ the steam temperature. In order to determine a vapor pressure curve for each cut, another vapor pressure and corresponding temperature is needed. This value can be found by extrapolating on Bell's curve, for change of vapor pressure with temperature for similar hydrocarbons. A Duhring line curve may then be constructed foreach cut, using mercury as a reference substance, and it will be possible to obtain vapor pressures for any of the steam temperatures contemplated. The vapor pressures and corresponding partial pressures for each out of the cil must also be determined for various saturated steam temperatures where my process is used under higher 614L£16 : than atmospheric pressure. From the partial pressure and the molecular weíght the parts per million weight of cil vapor present in the steam may then be computed. Molecular weights are, of course, determined by standard laboratory methods. From the practical viewpoint it should be recalled that cil as a vapor cannot be removed by centrifugal separation. Only those parts which are in liquid phase, regardless of how small the liquid phase particles may be while they are dispersed in the vapor mixture, are subject to complete centrifugal separation. The above explanation will serve to indicate when, why and how precision separation of any desired fraction is possible and practical with my process. I have already explained how my present invention may be used Æo advantage for the equilibrium flash-steam distillation of tar sand cil and I have shown the only method which is entirely practical for heating this very viscous cil to very high preheat quickly enough so that there will be little or no cracking, by the employment of hot natural gas that goes into solution in the cil for the necessary heat transfer. Because of the well-known hlgh sulfur contents of ai1 tar sand oils, averaging 5%, all of it in chemical combination with hydrocarbons, my process is extra important and valuable because it entirely prevents ar v changes of the sulfur in the structure of the respective molecules taking place. The type or types of sulfur compounds which were originally in the cil are found in the distillates and on this hinges the relative ease of sulfu removal, as well as the cost to a large extent. I have previously indicated how my process maybe used for auy of the many purposes of thermal conversion. These include not only the production of coker distillate, but also the production of gasoline from the latter after mild hydrogenation. If it is used before mild hydrogenation, as it can be right in the tar sand field, then the product itself would have to be hydrogenated. This would to advantage replace the Houdry process as well as fluidized, catalytic cracking. • • . •• r• 3o ,61441 6 Whatever the ultimate objecte are, whether the production of coker distillates, or gasoline, or whether the object might be to make out of tar sand cil suitable charging stocks for any of the many processes now used in the petroleum and porto-chemical industries, there are certain essential requirements which in all cases have to be met, and my present process can meet them. They are: First, it is highly desirable to provide chemically pure steam without which it is impossible to get superheaters that will stand up for any length of time when steam is to be superheated to such extreme temperatures as 2000° or 2500°F., even at the low pressures which are characteristic of ai1 these strongly endothermic reactions. The total steam required both for charging the liquid phase charging stock (which, as already explained, is a hot gaseous solution under pressure) instantaneously into the vapor phase by flash equilibriumsteam distillation, may be divided into two parts in the amounts required each for distillation proper and for the thermal conversion. The steam is then throttled down to whatever low pressure may be required for that particular operation, say to I0 pounds gauge pressure, and further superheated. This results in the continuous production of the necessary process steam having the precise thermal properties required from it for whatever the purpose of this thermal conversion may be. Heat transfer in ordinary distillation, including mild cracking, takes place at relatively high pressures, and requires high pressure steam, for example, ordinary steam ..... pressures of 100 or more pounds. Endothermic processes, such as thermal conversion, require low pressures and very high temperatures, for example, I0 psi or less and 2000° to 250G°F. steam. Assume kerosene, naphta, or somewhat heavier distillate cil derived from tar sand crude cil is to be thermally converted predominantly to unsaturated gases containing 02 , 03 , and 04 hydrocarbons. This would require a contact time of one second at a temperature of 1350°F. It i » il ii i ii• i • i/) le 61441 6 would involve the mixing of one to two pounds of steam per pound of cil, the steam being made available at less than lO pounds gauge pressure and a temperature of 2100°-250OOF. The cil would be supplied at temperatures in the range of 850°-]lO°F.' The weight ratio of steam will, in part, be determined by the temperature of the cil and whether it is made available as a liquid or as a l or. At an average ratio of steam to cil charge of 1.5 lbs./Ib., the thermal conversion steam requirements for about 50,000 lbs. per hour of naphta charge would be 75,000 Ibs. I have already shown that my present and economic way whereby many products, old from the ultra viscous, heavy cil occurring unlimited quantities. The equipment needed cost a great deal less than that needed for processes. It will be much safer, simpler, maintenance will be very much less, and the processes can be made completely automatic. process ï m de commercially practical by the initial process step of making the cil suitable for dispersing it in the finest possible spray in s,team by first dissolving enough ho natural gas in it under pressure. The exact pressur$ and temperature conditions from which this will result with any tar sand cil are only of secondary importance. At most it only affects the pump work which is relatively small even for high pressures. The pressure at which the two-fluid spray nozzle operates and from which the mixed vapor is then discharged into the flash chamber may be any that is suitable for the purpose concerned. Whether or not the vapor mixture under pressure is expanded during flashing through a back pressure regulator or valve is a matter of choice. Either may be satisfactory. There is one thing, however, of practical importance that should be mentioned, and that is hat I use two principal means for separation: invention provides a practical and new, may be manufactured in the tar sands in almost to carry out my process will fluidized coking or other easier to operate, lO any solids that may be in the cil or may be formed as dissociation products for instance, in various processes of thermal conversion. In one separating way, which may be used in the production of "coker distillation, for instance, carbon will be one of the dissociation products, but it will be colloidal carbon, not solid coke, After flashing, this and/or any other colloidal or generally very finely dispersed solids I separate from the dry saturated and for the most part superheated vapors in the mixture by passing them through a battery of small diameter cyclones. A number of suitable cyclones are commercially available. A plurality of such cyclones are used in parallel rather than a single cyclone of greater diameter, because the centrifugal force increases as the diameter but, what is much more important, also as the square of the revolutions per minute. In another separating way, which may be used when the finely dispersed or colloidal impurities are to be separated from the super- )iii / i saturated or wet vapor, I employ a suitable receiver resembling a flash :: ! t uk in standard steam practìce, and equipped like one, in which one or more standard Hagan centrifugal steam !separators are mounted. The application of such an insulated flash tank with liquid level control .... permits the continuous discharge of a small fraction containing some of the highest boiling constituents of the mixture in the form of a hot liquid, which will carry away with it ai1 the solids. Such a residue except in special cases, is of little value, and is best disposed of by burning as fuel. In the special case of the residue from tar sand crude cil, it might provide a by-product profit by recovering from it any valuable metals like nickel and vanadium which it may contain in suffìcient concentration to make it pay.

Referring to the drawings, Figure I is a graph illustrating the bt lb, content of high pressure steam superheated to different temperatures and throttled down to one atmosphere. However, the steam may be throttled down to any desired pressure for use in this process, relatively low pressures being preferred in this process. In Figure 2, natural gas, as previously defined, is supplied through a pipe lO to a superheater ii of amy desired construction. IO The superheated gas is directed by pipe 12 to a nozzle-type continuous heater 15 of well-knovrn construction. Heavy crude cil is directed to this nozzle through pipe 17 by a pump or other means indicated at 18. A turbulent condition is set up in the nozzle so that the gas and cil are mixed thereìn. For some types of cil or for some purposes, this mixing may be sufficient, but it is desirable to direct the mixture through a pipe 20 to a mixing chamber 22, said chamber having a drum 23 rotatably mounted therein. This drum is provided with a plurality of slots 24 in its periphery and extending longitudinally thereof. The drum may be open at one end as indicated at 25. This drum is carried by a shaft 26 which ex,ends through a suitable bearing 27 at one end of chamber 22, and is rotated at high speeds by a suitable source of power, such as an electric motor 28, connected te the shaft through a belt and pulley arrangement shown at 29. An extremely thorough mixing of the gas and cil takes place very rapidly in chamber 22. The oil-gas mixture is directed out of chamber 22 through pipe Thus, in the apparatus of Figure 2, the natural gas and crude cil are quickly and intimately mixed together, thereby raising the " temperature of the cil to a very high point, this depending upon the temperatures of the cil supplied to the apparatus and of the gas emerging from the superheater II. The gas dissolves in the cil, thereby greatly reducing its viscosity. As previously stated, the i oll at the resulting temperature may be saturated with the gas, but it is preferable not to carry the mixing process quite to the saturation point. The temperature of the cil may be raised to any desired peint, and its viscosity lowered to any desired degree. The preheated cil with the natural gas dissolved therein is directed by pipe 30 to the distilling apparatus illustrated in Figure 3. Pipe 30 extends to a nozzle-type continuous heater 34. Steam superheated to any desired point and at any convenient pressure is directed by 6144.1 6 pipe 36 into the heater 34 where it is instantly and intimately mixed with the preheated cil. As stated above, it is preferable to use low pressure steam. The temperatures of the steam and cil control the vaporization of the hydrocarbons of the cil. The steam and cil are sprayed together into an expansion chamber 39 where ai1 the hydrocarbon constituents or any predetermined constituents are instantly vaporized° The temperature of the steam may be controlled to make selective vaporization or to vaporize ai1 the constituents of the cil. If it is desired to maintain a predetermined pressure in the expansion chamber, as is sometimes necessary, a back-pressure regulating valve 40 may be provided at the chamber outlet, but this valve may be omitted. All the various constituents of the cil are recovered by means of any of the well-known processes and apparatus. Figures 3 and 5 to 7 illustrate a preferred form of separator 42 to be used when no chemical change in the volatile hydrocarbons, or mild crackpot only takes place. A pipe 4 leads from expansion chamber 39 to the entrance 45 of an expansion chamber 46 which forms part of separator 42. A vertical baffle 47 directs the vapors and stay unvaporized liquid and impurities towards the bottom of the chamber. One or more separator units 49 is or are mounted in the chamber, there preferably being a battery of these units, two only of which are illustrated in Figure 5. These tilts are of well-known construction. Each unit comprises a circular base chamber 51 having a tube 52 projecting inwardly centrally therefrom. The space 53 between this tube and the top of the base chamber forms an annular entrance for th@ latter, in which a plurality of downwardly-inclined radiating baffles 54 are provided. The chamber has a false bottom 56 which terminates short of the chamber wall to provide an annular passage 57 around its edge. A discharge pipe 58 opens into the chamber tangentially thereof below bottom 56. This pipe is connected to a vertical pipe 59 which extends to a point near the bottom of separator chamber 46. An overflow discharge pipe 60 extends through the bottom of the latter chamber. The tube 52 of each separator unit 49 is connected to a pipe 62 which extends upwardly to and opens out through a horizontal baffle 63 in chamber 46. This baffle is connected to vertical baffle 47, and the wpace at the top of the separator chamber defined by these baffles communicates with an outlet 64 to which a pipe 65 is connected. The vaporized and unvaporized constituents of the crude cil are directed by pipe 44 from expansion chamber 39 into chamber 46 of separator 42. Liquid components and any solids are directed towards the bottom of the separator. The vapors pass through the entrances 53 of the separating units 49 and are caused by the inclined baffles 54 to whirl around within the chamber 51. Any liquid or solid particles which are carried by the vapors into the units are separated from the vapors by centrifugal force and are directed out of the units through pipes 58, whence pipes 59 direct them to the bottom of the separator. A predetermined level of liquid is maintained in the bottom of the separator chamber by pipe 60, while the liquid flows out of said chamber through .this pipe. The temperature of the preheated crude and of the superheated steam directed to heater 34 are so controlled that some of the highboiling point constituents of the cil remain in liquid form so as to wash out any impurities in the separator 42. The various vapor fractions may now be recovered in any desirable manner. Figure 3 shows a plurality of fractionating column Feld scrubbers 65 arranged in series for this purpose. These scrubbers and the equipment associated with them are well known in the art and do not need any description herein. They. are included to show one way of recovering the volatile hydrocarbons of the crude cil. Figûres 8 te ll illustrate an alternative form of separator 72 • .......... • :!: " i)/ »:::» : i:i; i • 61441'6 which may be substituted for separator 42 of Figure 3. This type of separator is preferred when ai1 the volatile hydrocarbons of the cil are vaporized in expansion chamber 39. Separator 72 is in the form of an expansion chamber 75 having an inlet 76 at one end, which is connected to pipe and an outlet 77 at its opposite end. A battery of centrifugal separating units 79 are located in chamber 75, each having a verticaldischarge pipe projecting from its upper end. A baffle wall 82 is provided in the separator chamber and is so located that it prevents the flow of the I0 gases from inlet 76 to outlet 77. The discharge tubes 80 of unit 79 extend through this baffle so that all gases must pass through the units before reaching the outlet. Each unit 79 is in the form of a cylinder 85 having an annular inlet 86 at the top thereof around tube 80, and a plurality of .... ï5 downwardly-inclined baffles 87 are located in the cylinder around tube just below the cylinder entrance 86. Spaced above the bottom 88 of the cylinder is a horizontal plate 89 having a central opening 90 therethrough, see Figure II. This plate has a plurality of ears 92 punched upwardly therefrom around its edge, each ear having a sharp leading edge 93 at its free end. The punching of each ear leaves an opening 94 therebeneath through the plate. The ears are inclined upwardly in the same direction and this also is the direction of the inclination of baffles 87. A discharge pipe 96 opens into cylinder 85 at the bottom and tangentially thereof. The discharge pipes 96 of the separator units open into a space 98 in the bottom of separator chamber 75 which is completely separate from the rest of the chamber. A discharge outlet 99 is formed in the bottom of the separator communicating with space 98. The vapors enter separator 72 through inlet 76 and pass through the seParator units 79 and out of the separator through outlet 77. /i i! i¸¸ //ï/ 6144,16 A whirling motion is imparted to the vapors in the units 79 so that any solid particles therein are separated by centrifugal force. These particles tend to whirl around the walls of the cylìnders 85, and are directed by ears 92 fo the bottom of said cylinders, whence they pass out through ipes96 into space 98 of th4 separator° These particles are removed from the separator in any desired manner. The outlet of separator 72 may be connected to pipe 65 leading into the battery of scrubbers 68. However, it may be connected to any other desired apparatus for further treatment of the purified vapors.
