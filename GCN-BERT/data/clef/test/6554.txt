Intermediate 80: 2-Ethoxy-8-methyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Step A: 2-ethoxy-6-iodo-8-methyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a solution of 1,2-diamino-5-iodo-3-methylpyridin-1-ium2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 12) (250 mg, 0.56 mmol) in acetic acid (0.75 mL) was added tetraethoxymethane (4.7 ml, 22.3 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 80° C. for 18 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with water, neutralized with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted with EtOAc (2×). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine; dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by flash chromatography (SiO2; 0-100% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as a white solid (55.0 mg, 33% yield).
