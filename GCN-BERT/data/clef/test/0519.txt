Intermediate 55: 5-Chloro-6-iodo-2-methyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
To a solution of 1,6-diamino-2-chloro-3-iodopyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 10, 500 mg, 1.06 mmol) in acetic anhydride (4.0 mL) was added aqueous HCl (37% solution; 59 μL, 0.71 mmol). The mixture was heated at 100° C. overnight. After cooling to 0° C., the reaction was carefully quenched with sat. aq. NaHCO3. The aqueous layer was extracted twice with EtOAc, and the combined organics washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was triturated with DCM to afford the title compound as a tan solid (93 mg, 30%).
