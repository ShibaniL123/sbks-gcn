BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates, generally, to a printable food and beverage tray. More particularly, it relates to an expandable tray having double latching sides that are adapted to interconnect to orient the tray in an open configuration. 2. Background Art Prior art concession trays have sidewalls with tabs that are inserted through corresponding openings in the tray during assembly. A user including, but not limited to, a concession employee or a quick service restaurant employee has to pre-assemble these trays having tabs in advance because the assembly process of positioning the tabs into the openings is time consuming. These tabs need to be individually inserted into their corresponding opening during the tray assembly. The assembled trays are then stacked and stored next to a register to be accessible to a user during the fulfillment of an order. When these bulky pre-assembled trays are stacked and stored next to a register, they take up valuable space which can be limited. Additionally, these bulky trays can obstruct a work area which can be burdensome to a user, can pose a fire hazard, and create a cluttered work space. It is more desirable for a user to be able to quickly assemble a concession tray just prior to fulfilling an order and without having to store bulky trays. Thus, there is a need for a concession tray that does not require pre-assembly, stacking, and the storing of bulky trays prior to the fulfillment of an order. More particularly, when the assembly process of inserting the sidewall tabs into the corresponding tray openings becomes burdensome and time consuming, the needed interconnecting latching mechanism would better act to quickly and more efficiently position the tray in an upright configuration. Prior art nesting trays and molded trays are not adapted to be received by an electrophotographic machine. It is more desirable for a concession tray to be adapted to be received by an electrophotographic machine including, but not limited to, a printer so the concession tray can receive text or an image located on a surface of the tray for advertising or promotional display. However, in view of the prior art considered as a whole at the time the present invention was made, it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art how the identified needs could be fulfilled. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The long-standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for an expandable tray having a primary layer and a secondary layer having a substantially parallel configuration, a primary layer configured to be moved in a direction of a third layer to orient the third layer and a support structure at approximately 90 degrees in relation to the secondary layer, the primary layer and the secondary layer having sidewalls forming a latch configured to interconnect with each other, thereby orienting the tray in an expanded configuration between the primary layer and the secondary layer, and at least one opening having a size great enough to receive food and beverages which also includes improvements that overcome the limitations of prior art concession trays is now met by a new, useful, and non-obvious invention. The invention includes an expandable tray having a housing with a primary layer located opposite a secondary layer. The primary layer has a primary sidewall, a secondary sidewall, a tertiary sidewall, and a quaternary sidewall. The secondary layer has a primary sidewall, a secondary sidewall, and a tertiary sidewall. The secondary layer is connected to an end of the quaternary sidewall of the primary layer, forming a primary hinge. The primary layer is connected to an end of the quaternary sidewall of the primary layer, forming a secondary hinge, whereby, the primary layer is foldable over the secondary layer. The primary and secondary layer sidewalls have protrusions located on both ends of the sidewalls. The protrusions are secured together with an attaching element including, but not limited to, adhesive, tape, double sided tape, a magnet, or a hook and loop attachment. When the primary layer is moved in a direction of the hinges relative to the stationary secondary layer, the quaternary sidewall shifts from an angle of between approximately 0 degrees and 60 degrees to approximately 90 degrees in relation to the secondary layer. The primary and secondary layer sidewalls are located adjacent to the hinges and they each have a recess forming a lip. The lip of the primary layer sidewalls are adapted to interlock with the lip of the secondary layer sidewalls. A protrusion located on an end portion of each of the secondary layer sidewalls is connected to a protrusion located on each of the end portions of the quaternary sidewall of the primary layer. Each secondary layer sidewall protrusion is connected to both quaternary sidewall protrusions with an attaching element. This interconnecting together of the tray sidewalls creates a quick and efficient expandable concession tray that a user can simply pop-up when an order has been placed, rather than pre-assembling the intricate tabs of concession trays currently on the market. It is within the scope of this invention for the expandable tray to initially have a closed configuration prior to use. The closed configuration of the tray is when the quaternary sidewall has an angle between approximately 0 degrees and 60 degrees in relation to the secondary layer. The concession tray has a substantially planar orientation when in a closed configuration. This allows for the ease of stacking and storing the more compact concession trays next to a register while taking food orders. The substantially planar orientation of the closed configuration concession tray is less bulky and does not take up as much space as a conventional concession tray. After an order has been placed, a user can interconnect the lips of the primary and secondary layer sidewalls together to position the concession tray in an open configuration. The open configuration of the concession tray is when the concession tray has an upright alignment, allowing the tray to receive including, but not limited to, food and beverages. The open configuration is when the quaternary side and support structure both have an angle of approximately 90 degrees in relation to the secondary layer. It is within the scope of this invention for a tray to include, but not be limited to, having a depth and having a bottom portion forming a border. In a preferred embodiment, the primary layer has two openings adapted to receive and secure including, but not limited to, a cup or a can. In another embodiment, these openings can have a plurality of reliefs radiating from the openings. The plurality of reliefs allows the openings to conform to a plurality of differing sized cups. Additionally, the primary layer has an opening adapted to receive and secure including, but not limited to, food, a plate, a bowl, or a container. It is within the scope of this invention for the primary layer to have at least one opening. In an alternate embodiment, the novel concession tray housing includes a support structure. In a preferred embodiment, the support structure is substantially centrally located within the housing. It is within the scope of this invention that the support structure is not centrally located. A portion of the primary layer is foldable along a hinge point located within an opening thereon the primary layer, whereby, forming a support structure. A mounting surface is connected to a portion of the support structure. The mounting surface is connected to a portion of the secondary layer with an attaching element. This support structure of the tray is configured to support the upright alignment of the tray when the concession tray is in an open configuration. In another embodiment, the tray can have at least one surface that is printed on, whereby, at least one layer has a surface thereon that allows for an image, text, or computer generated data. The text, image, human readable data, and computer generated data include, but are not limited to, advertising, a promotion, a logo, a product description, a coupon, or company information. In yet another embodiment, the novel concession tray has a portion of at least one layer that is adapted to be removable. More particularly, a coupon printed on a portion of the concession tray can be easily torn away from the concession tray by an end user. It is within the scope of this invention for the concession tray to have a perforated, tear-away coupon. These embodiments are illustrative of the invention and are not exhaustive thereof. As paper technology evolves, it is within the scope of this invention for all such future embodiments of the concession tray to be constructed of any such material to encompass these technological advances. It is a preferred embodiment for the novel expandable tray to be constructed of a recyclable material including, but not limited to, SUS and stone paper. It is within the scope of this invention for the concession tray to be constructed of any material capable of being printed upon including, but not limited to, Solid Unbleached Sulfate (SUS) paper, stone paper, Aqua-Kote carrier board, paperboard, cardboard, paper made from a bio-polymer, or paper made from a petroleum based polymer. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a compact concession tray that is adapted to maximize storage space having interlocking sidewalls that easily expands the folded concession tray from a closed configuration to an upright open configuration.
