INDEX TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a non-provisional of and claims benefit to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/951,888 filed Mar. 12, 2015 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) have become a popular alternative to conventional cigarettes. Although there are many touted advantages, current electronic cigarettes still include various aspects in their configurations that are not optimal. With the increased popularity of e-cigarettes, configuration flaws have raised several issues. The list below includes but is not limited to, several known issues with current e-cigarette cartridges: 1. The current cartridges can leak e-liquid, which causes a problem for shelf life and overall product quality.2. The wadding used for transferring the e-liquid to the wick varies in volume causing different burn rates.3. The heater cartridge assemblies are filled by hand using a syringe, which allows for various volumes to be in the cartridges. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the current invention is an electronic cigarette system comprising: an outer cartridge assembly; an inner housing configured to hold a liquid; a mouthpiece configured as a unitary single piece being part of said inner housing; a heater; a power source; and an actuator operatively associated with said power source, said heater configured to vaporize liquid in said inner housing and deliver said vapor through the mouthpiece. In a preferred embodiment, the fluid cylinder has 2 flat sides to it. This is to allow the vapor to travel up to the end. At the end, there is a cut out channel that has a hole in it. This is where the vapor exits. In one embodiment, there is a Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pad. This PAD is heat staked to the cartridge. The fluid soaks this pad but it doesn't leak. The wick then touches this PET pad and through a capillary action and also gets wet. The heater then vaporizes the fluid off of the wick. In one preferred embodiment, the interior of the cylinder tapers. This is needed to release the cylinder from the mold during manufacture. The same is true on the exterior of the cartridge. This is referred to as an angular offset. Where the vapor leaves the cartridge, this is all a single piece. This is achieved with slides in the mold. Because of this, it is all a single material and a single piece. In one embodiment, the invention is an electronic cigarette system comprising: an outer cartridge assembly; an inner housing configured to hold a liquid, said inner housing formed with a pair of opposing flat sides on either side of a circular cylinder, whereby each flat side angles inward in an angular offset towards a central axis of said inner housing; a mouthpiece configured as a unitary single piece being part of said inner housing; a heater; a power source; and an actuator operatively associated with said power source, said heater configured to vaporize liquid in said inner housing and deliver said vapor through the mouthpiece. In one embodiment, the mouthpiece is fused to said inner housing in a manner free of adhesive. Adhesive attachment is disfavored due to continual use of vaporized liquid could cause adhesive to be releases and ingested. In one embodiment, the angular offset is 0.5-2.0 degrees inward towards said central axis relative to a perpendicular line. In one embodiment, the angular offset is 0.5 degrees inward towards said central axis relative to a perpendicular line. In one embodiment, the system is including a polyethylene terephthalate pad that is heat staked to the inner housing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention overcomes the problems known in the art by providing an assembly having a heater assembly 10, outer cartridge housing 12 and inner (liquid) cartridge assembly 14. The inner assembly 14 is configured with an inner assembly inner housing, 16, and a screen 18. Although many materials are suitable to form screen 18, preferred material include, but are not limited to felt or metal. The configurations disclosed herein represent a significant improvement in manufacturing and use by providing a mouthpiece or vapor outlet formed as a single unitary structure with the inner assembly. Currently used adhesives utilized in affixing mouthpieces are subject to failure and present significant danger to users. The present configuration not only provides for the unitary structure, but provides a unitary structure configured for filling with a vaporizable liquid after the structure is fully assembled. The inner housing, 16 provides an incorporated mouth piece portion 26 from which the user will inhale the vapor. Prior e-cigarettes required the mouthpiece to be a second member formed and attached to the assembly. The liquid cartridge assembly, 14, is filled through the felt or metal screen, 18, using a hyperemic filling needle, or similar device. In one embodiment, the present invention includes a heater assembly 20, outer cartridge housing, 22, and inner (liquid) cartridge assembly, 24, which is has a septum style mouthpiece, 26, inner housing, 28, and felt or metal screen, 30. In an embodiment as best shown in FIG. 4, components are aligned and the assembly including mouthpiece 26 inner housing 28 are fused to result in a single piece that requires no adhesive. In one embodiment, the single fused structure is assembled with a sonic weld as is known in the art. The liquid cartridge, 14, is then inserted into the outer cartridge, 12, and fully seats on top of the heating element, 10, to allow e-liquid to be transferred to the heater assembly. The inner housing, 16, has an inner central cavity 19. Housing 16 is semi rigid plastic in the preferred embodiment. In the secondary embodiment, the inner housing, 16, is soft plastic that will provide the user a softer more realistic conventional cigarette feel. In one embodiment, inner assembly housing 16 is not a round cylinder but includes a pair of opposite congruent flat sides as seen in FIG. 10. Perimeter portion 50 has flat side 52 formed therewith. Mouthpiece end 40 has vapor exit 42 formed thereon and is formed adjacent to channel 21. These sides are not perpendicular to the base, but include an angular offset. As best seen in FIG. 11. A theoretical flat base line 60 is formed with the base of the device of the present invention. As understood, the base is the end where channel 21 and mouthpiece 40 are positioned. There is a centerline 62 that is the center of assembly 16. Lines 64 represent perpendicular lines relative to base line 60. Offset lines 66 represent the direction and orientation of flat sides 52. Angle 68 represents the angular offset inward towards centerline 62 of each flat side 52. Angle 68 is between 0.5-2.5 degrees offset inward from perpendicular lines 64. In one preferred embodiment, the angular offset is 0.5 degrees. It has been discovered that angles greater than 2.5 degree offset are disfavored and lead to numerous manufacturing and use difficulties. If has been discovered that the slight angular offsets disclosed herein represents a significant improvement in providing greater precision and accuracy in manufacturing on a commercial level. While the invention has been described in its preferred form or embodiment with some degree of particularity, it is understood that this description has been given only by way of example and that numerous changes in the details of construction, fabrication, and use, including the combination and arrangement of parts, may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. 1.
