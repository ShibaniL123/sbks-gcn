Technical Field The present invention relates to a method for the in-vitro activation of a helper T cell, comprising adding a WT1 peptide to an antigen-presenting cell, and thereby activating the helper T cell, wherein the WT1 peptide has an ability to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule and a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment and/or prevention of a cancer by activating a helper T cell. Background WT1 gene (Wilms' tumor 1 gene) was identified as a gene responsible for Wilms tumor which is a renal cancer in children (Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2). WT1 is a transcription factor having a zinc finger structure. At the beginning, the WT1 gene was considered to be a tumor suppressor gene. However, subsequent studies (Non-Patent Documents 3, 4, 5 and 6) showed that the WT1 gene rather functions as an oncogene in hematopoietic tumors and solid cancers. It was shown that a WT1 peptide-specific T-lymphocyte (CTL) can be induced by in vitro stimulating a peripheral blood mononuclear cell with a WT1 peptide, and such a CTL damages a cancer cell such as a hematopoietic tumor cell and solid cancer cell which endogenously expresses WT1. The CTL recognizes the WT1 peptide as the form of the complex in which the WT1 peptide binds to an MHC class I molecule. Therefore, such a WT1 peptide is different depending on the subtypes of MHC class I (Patent Document 1, Non-Patent Document 7, and Patent Documents 2, 3 and 4). The existence of a helper T cell specific for an cancer antigen is important to induce a CTL effectively (Non-Patent Document 8). The helper T cell is induced and activated by the recognition of a complex of an MHC class II molecule and an antigen peptide on an antigen-presenting cell. The activated helper T cell produces a cytokine such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 or interferon to help the growth, differentiation or maturation of a B cell. The activated helper T cell also has a function to facilitate the growth, differentiation or maturation of other T cell subsets (for example, Tc and TD cell). Thus, the activated helper T cell has a function to activate an immune system by facilitating the growth or activation of a B cell or T cell. Therefore, enhancing a function of a helper T cell through an MHC class II-binding antigen peptide (a helper peptide) in a cancer immunotherapy to increase the effect of a cancer vaccine is considered to be useful (Non-Patent Document 9, Patent Document 13). Only a peptide binding to an HLA-DRB1*0401 molecule (Non-Patent Document 10), a peptide binding to an HLA-DRB1*0405 molecule and a peptide binding to an HLA-DRB1*1502 molecule (Patent Document 5) were found as a helper peptide of WT1 to date. Therefore, there is a need to find peptides each biding to an HLA-DRB1*1501, HLA-DPB1*0901 or HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. Furthermore, it was shown that among the helper peptides, there is a promiscuous helper peptide which can bind to multiple MHC class II molecules, and induce helper T cells (Non-Patent Documents 11 and 12). However, it was very difficult to identify a promiscuous helper peptide which binds to three or more types of MHC class II molecules and exerts a sufficient effect.

Thus, the present invention has been completed. The present invention provides: (1) a method for the in-vitro activation of a helper T cell, comprising adding a WT1 peptide to an antigen-presenting cell, and thereby activating the helper T cell, wherein the WT1 peptide is a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence: Lys Arg Tyr Phe Lys Leu Ser His Leu Gln Met His Ser Arg Lys His (SEQ ID No: 2) and has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, wherein said helper T cell is that from a subject who is any one of a HLA-DRB1*1501-positive, HLA-DPB1*0901-positive and HLA-DPB1*0501-positive subject;(2) the method according to (1), wherein the WT1 peptide has an ability to bind to at least two of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule;(3) the method according to (1) or (2), wherein the WT1 peptide further has an ability to bind to an HLA-DRB1*0405 molecule and/or HLA-DRB1*1502 molecule;(4) the method according to any one of (1)-(3), wherein the WT1 peptide has an ability to bind to an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, HLA-DRB1*0405 molecule and HLA-DRB1*1502 molecule;(5) the method according to any one of (1)-(4), wherein the addition of the WT1 peptide to the antigen-presenting cell is practiced by the addition of the WT1 peptide, the addition of an expression vector comprising the polynucleotide encoding the WT1 peptide or the addition of a cell including the expression vector;(6) a pharmaceutical composition comprising a WT1 peptide for the treatment or prevention of a cancer in a subject who is any one of a HLA-DRB1*1501-positive, HLA-DPB1*0901-positive and HLA-DPB1*0501-positive subject, wherein the WT1 peptide is a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence: Lys Arg Tyr Phe Lys Leu Ser His Leu Gln Met His Ser Arg Lys His (SEQ ID No: 2) and has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule;(7) a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment or prevention of a cancer in a subject who is any one of a HLA-DRB1*1501-positive, HLA-DPB1*0901-positive and HLA-DPB1*0501 positive subject, comprising a helper T cell from said subject activated with a WT1 peptide, wherein the WT1 peptide is a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence: Lys Arg Tyr Phe Lys Leu Ser His Leu Gln Met His Ser Arg Lys His (SEQ ID No: 2) and has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. Effects of the Invention The present invention provides a method for the in-vitro activation of a helper T cell with a WT1 peptide which binds to an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, HLA-DRB1*0405 molecule, and HLA-DRB1*1502 molecule, as well as a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment and/or prevention of a cancer by activating a helper T cell. Therefore, it is possible to activate in vivo and in vitro a helper T cell in the subject having any of such MHC class II molecules, treat and prevent a cancer. Because about 90 % of Japanese people are covered by the five types of MHC class II subclasses, helper T cells can be activated to treat and/or prevent a cancer in a very wide range of subjects.

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for the activation of a helper T cell, comprising adding a WT1 peptide to an antigen-presenting cell, and thereby activating the helper T cell, wherein the WT1 peptide has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. In the present invention, the WT1 peptide refers a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 (being a part of the amino acid sequence of human WT1 protein shown in SEQ ID No: 1), and has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, or a peptide in which various substances such as an amino acid, a peptide or an analog thereof may be attached at the N-terminus and/or the C-terminus of the peptide. The substance can be processed, for example, by an enzyme in a living body or through a process such as intracellular processing, and finally the WT1 peptide becomes the form which can bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. The substance may be a substance that modulates the solubility of the WT1 peptide of the present invention, or increases its stability (resistance to protease). Alternatively, it may be a substance that delivers the WT1 peptide of the present invention specifically, for example, to a given tissue or organ, or increases the efficiency of uptake by an antigen-presenting cell. Alternatively, it may be a WT1 peptide which is restricted to the same type of an MHC class I molecule as that of a subject from which an antigen-presenting cell is derived. The WT1 peptide of the present invention has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. Thus, the WT1 peptide may be a peptide which has an ability to bind to at least two of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, or a peptide that has an ability to bind to an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule and/or HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and/or HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, and an HLA class II molecule other than the molecules, for example, a peptide which has an ability to bind to an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DRB1*0405 molecule and/or HLA-DRB1*1502 molecule, a peptide which has an ability to bind to an HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule, HLA-DRB1*0405 molecule and/or HLA-DRB1*1502 molecule, a peptide which has an ability to bind to an HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, HLA-DRB1*0405 molecule and/or HLA-DRB1*1502 molecule, or a peptide which has an ability to bind to an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, HLA-DRB1*0405 molecule and/or HLA-DRB1*1502 molecule. The WT1 peptide having an amino acid sequence: Lys Arg Tyr Phe Lys Leu Ser His Leu Gln Met His Ser Arg Lys His (SEQ ID No: 2) has the ability to bind to an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, an HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule, an HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, an HLA-DRB1*0405 molecule and an HLA-DRB1*1502 molecule. In general, an MHC class II-binding peptide consists of 10-25 amino acids. Therefore, the WT1 peptide preferably has an amino acid sequence consisting of 10-25 amino acids. The above-mentioned WT1 peptide can be synthesized by methods generally used in the art or modifications thereof. Such methods are described, for example, in Peptide Synthesis, Interscience, New York, 1966; The Proteins, Vol 2, Academic Press Inc., New York, 1976; Peptide-Gosei, Maruzen Co., Ltd., 1975; Peptide-Gosei No Kiso To Jikken, Maruzen Co., Ltd., 1985; and Iyakuhin No Kaihatsu (Zoku), Vol. 14, Peptide-Gosei, Hirokawa - Book store, 1991. The above-mentioned WT1 peptide can also be prepared using genetic engineering techniques based on the information about the nucleotide sequence that encodes the WT1 peptide. Such genetic engineering techniques are well known to a person skilled in the art. The antigen-presenting cell refers to a cell such as a dendritic cell which can present the WT1 peptide together with a MHC class II molecule to a helper T cell. Thus, a subject from which the antigen-presenting cell is derived must have the same subclass of MHC class II (for example, HLA-DRB1*1501, HLA-DPB1*0901, HLA-DPB1*0501, HLA-DRB1*0405 or HLA-DRB1*1502) as that to which the added WT1 peptide binds. In general, a helper T cell is activated by the recognition of an antigen peptide through an MHC class II molecule on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell by TCR-CD3 complex on the surface of the T cell, and the stimulation of an integrin on the surface of the T cell by an integrin ligand on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. In the present invention, the activation of the helper T cell encompasses not only the activation of the helper T cell but also the induction and growth of the helper T cell. As described above, the activated helper T cell has a function to activate an immune system by increasing the induction, growth or activation of a B cell or T cell. Thus, the method for the activation of a helper T cell of the present invention can be used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of a cancer. Alternatively, the helper T cell activated in vitro using the method of the present invention can be used to treat or prevent a cancer or can be used as an adjuvant therapy in the same. The activation of the helper T cell can be determined by measuring the amount of the production or secretion of a cytokine such as an interferon and an interleukin. The addition of the WT1 peptide to the antigen-presenting cell may be practiced directly by the addition of the WT1 peptide, or indirectly by the addition of an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding the WT1 peptide or the addition of a cell comprising the expression vector. The expression vector comprising the polynucleotide encoding the WT1 peptide, and the cell comprising the expression vector can be produced by the method well known to the person skilled in the art. Further disclosed is a composition for activating a helper T cell by the addition of a WT1 peptide to an antigen-presenting cell, comprising the WT1 peptide, wherein the WT1 peptide has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. When the composition of the present invention is administered to an HLA-DRB1*1501, HLA-DPB1*0901 or HLA-DPB1*0501-positive subject, an immune system in the subject is activated by the activation of the helper T cell in the subject. The WT1 gene is expressed at high levels in various cancers and tumors including hematopoietic tumors such as leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma or malignant lymphoma, and solid cancers such as gastric cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, germ cell cancer, hepatic cancer, skin cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer or ovarian cancer. Therefore, the composition of the present invention can be used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment or prevention of a cancer. Alternatively, the helper T cell activated using the composition of the present invention can be used, for example, as an adjuvant in the treatment of a cancer. As described above, the above-mentioned WT1 peptide may be a peptide which has an ability to bind to at least two of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, or a peptide which has an ability to bind to an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule and/or HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and/or HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, and an MHC class II molecule other than them. Thus, as long as the antigen-presenting cell is derived from a subject positive for an MHC class II subclass to which the WT1 peptide of the present invention can bind, the effect of activating the helper T cell of the composition of the present invention can result. The above-mentioned composition may comprise in addition to the WT1 peptide, for example, a carrier, an excipient or an additive. Because the WT1 peptide comprised in said composition activate the helper peptide specifically to the WT1 peptide, the composition may comprise an MHC class I-restricted WT1 peptide, or it may be used with the peptide. The method for using said composition can be appropriately selected depending on conditions such as the desired activation of the helper T cell, the state of the antigen-presenting cell. Examples of such methods include intradermal administration, subcutaneous administration, intramuscular administration, intravenous administration, nasal administration and oral administration, and the addition to a culture medium of the antigen-presenting cell. The amount of the WT1 peptide comprised in the composition, as well as the form, the number of times of use of the composition of the present invention can be appropriately selected depending on conditions such as the desired activation of the helper T cell, the state of the antigen-presenting cell. Further disclosed is a composition for activating a helper T cell by the addition of a WT1 peptide to an antigen-presenting cell, comprising an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding the WT1 peptide or a cell comprising the expression vector, wherein the WT1 peptide has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. The expression vector comprising the polynucleotide encoding the WT1 peptide and the cell comprising the expression vector are described above. Further disclosed is the use of an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a WT1 peptide, or a cell comprising the expression vector for the manufacture of the above-mentioned composition. Further disclosed is a kit for activating a helper T cell by the addition of a WT1 peptide to an antigen-presenting cell, comprising the WT1 peptide, wherein the WT1 peptide has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. Preferably, the kit is used in the method for the activation of a helper T cell. The kit may comprise in addition to the WT1 peptide, for example, a means of obtaining an antigen-presenting cell, or a means to determine a helper T cell activity. In general, an instruction manual is attached to the kit. By using the kit of the present invention, helper T cells can be induced efficiently. Further disclosed is a kit for activating a helper T cell by the addition of a WT1 peptide to an antigen-presenting cell, comprising an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a WT1 peptide, or a cell comprising the expression vector, wherein the WT1 peptide has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. Further disclosed is a method for the treatment or prevention of a cancer in a subject, comprising adding a WT1 peptide to an antigen-presenting cell, and thereby activating a helper T cell, wherein the WT1 peptide has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. In the above-mentioned method the immune system in the subject is activated by the activation of a helper T cell, and a cancer in the subject is treated or prevented. The addition of the WT1 peptide to the antigen-presenting cell may be practiced directly by the addition of the WT1 peptide, or indirectly by the addition of an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding the WT1 peptide or the addition of a cell comprising the expression vector. As described above, the helper T cell recognizes the complex of any one of MHC class II molecules, particularly an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule or HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule and the WT1 peptide. Therefore, the subject is a subject having an MHC class II molecule to which the WT1 peptide binds, for example, HLA-DRB1*1501-positive, HLA-DPB1*0901-positive or HLA-DPB1*0501-positive subject. As described above, the WT1 peptide of the present invention may be a peptide which has an ability to bind to at least two of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, or a peptide which has an ability to bind to an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule and/or HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and/or HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, and an MHC class II molecule other than them. Thus, in such a case, it is possible to treat or prevent a cancer in a subject positive for an MHC class II subclass to which the WT1 peptide of the present invention can bind. The cancer to be treated or prevented may be any one, and examples thereof include hematopoietic tumors such as leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma or malignant lymphoma, and solid cancers such as gastric cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, germ cell cancer, hepatic cancer, skin cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer or ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the method of the present invention may be used with a method for the treatment or prevention of a cancer with an MHC class I molecule-restricted WT1 peptide or a pharmaceutical composition for the same. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment or prevention of a cancer in a subject by activating a helper T cell by the addition of a WT1 peptide to an antigen-presenting cell, comprising the WT1 peptide, wherein the WT1 peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 and has an ability to bind to any one of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule. The WT1 gene is expressed at high levels in various cancers and tumors including hematopoietic tumors such as leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma or malignant lymphoma, and solid cancers such as gastric cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, germ cell cancer, hepatic cancer, skin cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer or ovarian cancer. Therefore, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be used for the treatment or prevention of a cancer. As described above, the above-mentioned WT1 peptide is a peptide which has an ability to bind to at least two of an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, or a peptide which has an ability to bind to an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule and/or HLA-DPB1*0901 molecule and/or HLA-DPB1*0501 molecule, and an MHC class II molecule other than them. Thus, as long as the antigen-presenting cell is derived from a subject positive for an MHC class II subclass to which the WT1 peptide can bind, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be used to treat or prevent a cancer. When the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is administered to, for example, an HLA-DRB1*1501-positive, HLA-DPB1*0901-positive or HLA-DPB1*0501-positive subject, an immune system in a subject can be activated by the activation of the helper T cell by the WT1 peptide comprised in the pharmaceutical composition, thereby treating or preventing a cancer. Thus, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be used in a method for the treatment or prevention of a cancer. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may comprise in addition to the WT1 peptide as an active ingredient, for example, a carrier or an excipient. The WT1 peptide comprised in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention binds to an MHC class II molecule on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell and activates a helper T cell. Therefore, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may further comprise an activator, growth factor, inducer of the helper T cell, or may comprise an MHC class I-restricted WT1 peptide.

The following examples illustrate the present invention in more detail. Examples 1. Preparation of antigen-presenting cell Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from peripheral blood that had been collected from a healthy donor (HLA-DRB1*1501-positive, HLA-DPB1*0901-positive or HLA-DPB1*0501-positive). The PBMCs were seeded to a 6-well plastic plate at the density of 1 x 107 cells/well in 1% AB serum (Nabi, Miami, FL), X-VIVO 15 medium (Cambrex), and cultured for 2 hours. After the culture, suspension cells were removed, and the remaining adherent cells were cultured in 1000 IU/ml IL-4 (PeproTech), 1000 IU/ml GM-CSF (PeproTech), 1% AB serum and X-VIVO 15 medium. On day 2 and day 4, the medium was changed, and IL-4 and GM-CSF were added. On day 6, 100 IU/ml TNF-α was added to mature antigen-presenting cells. 2. Induction of WT1 peptide-specific CD4-positive T cell CD4-positive T cells were separated from blood derived from the same donor using RosetteSep for the separation of CD4-positive T cells (StemCell). The CD4-positive T cells (3 x 106 cells) were added to each well of a 24-well plate. They were stimulated with autologous antigen-presenting cells (3 x 105 cells) that had been pulsed with 20 µg/ml WT1 peptide (SEQ ID No: 2), and irradiated with 25 Gy of radiation. On next day after the stimulation, 20 IU/ml IL-2 was added. Likewise, the stimulated CD4-positive T cells were stimulated using the antigen-presenting cells pulsed with 20 µg/ml WT1 peptide every other week. Furthermore, the medium was changed to the medium containing IL-2 every other day after second stimulation. The CD4-positive T cells induced by total three times of stimulation (HLA-DRB1*1501 and HLA-DPB1*0901-positive T cells were defined as TA28.1 cell and E15.2 cell, respectively) were used for experiments below. 3. Measurement of IFN-γ TA28.1 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a subject from which the TA28.1 cells were derived were cultured in the presence of 20 µg/ml WT1 peptide for 24 hours. After the culture, the amount of IFN-γ in the supernatant was quantified using ELISA kit. As a control, a peripheral blood mononuclear cell from an HLA-DRB1*1501-negative subject was used. The results are shown in Fig. 1. It was confirmed that TA28.1 cell recognizes the WT1 peptide specifically to an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule to increase the produced amount of IFN-γ (that is, activation). Furthermore, it was confirmed that TA28.1 cell and E15.2 cell do not produce IL-4 and IL-10 using ELISA kit. The results are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. It was confirmed that TA28.1 and E15.2 cell are Th1 cells. HLA-DPB1*0501/*0501-positive mononuclear cells were used to perform the following experiments. The cells were suspended to X-VIVO (1% AB serum), and 20 µg/ml WT1 peptide, 10 µg/ml Brefeldin A and 0.5 µg/ml CD28/49d were added. They were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 4 hours. As a control, a cell incubated without the addition of a WT1 peptide was used. After washing with buffer, an anti-CD3-perCP antibody and an anti-CD4-APC antibody were added, and they were incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes. After washing with buffer, the cells were fixed and permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (4°C, 20 minutes). After washing with BD perm/wash buffer, an anti-INF-γ-FITC (BD, clone: B27) and anti-IL-17-PE (eBioscience, clone: eBio64DEC17) were added, and they were incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes. After washing with buffer, cells were analyzed with FACSAria. The results are shown in Fig. 4. It was confirmed that an HLA-DPB1*0501-positive mononuclear cells grow, and produces IFN-γ and IL-17. 4. Growth assay The growth assay was performed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation method. TA28.1 cells (3 x 104 cells) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HLA-DRB1*1501-positive; 1 x 105 cells) that had been pulsed with the WT1 peptides and irradiated were cocultured in a 96-well plate. After coculturing for 80 hours, 37kBq/well [3H]-thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was added. They were incubated for another 16 hours, and measured using β-scintillation counter. The measurements were represented as count/minute (cpm). As a control, a peripheral blood mononuclear cell without pulsing with a peptide was used. Furthermore, in order to confirm that the activation signal is specific for an HLA-DRB1*1501 molecule, an anti-MHC class I antibody, anti-HLA-DR antibody, anti-HLA-DQ antibody and anti-HLA-DP antibody were used. The results are shown in Fig. 5. It was confirmed that TA28.1 cells were activated by a signal through the WT1 peptide and HLA-DRB1*1501, and grown. It was further confirmed that the growth was specific for HLA-DRB1*1501, because it was suppressed by the anti-HLA-DR antibody. Likewise, E15.2 cells were used to perform the growth assay. As an additional control, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an HLA-DPB1*0901-negative subject were used. The results are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. It was confirmed that E15.2 cells were activated by a signal through the WT1 peptide and HLA-DPB1*0901, and grown. It was further confirmed that the growth is specific for HLA-DPB1*0901, because it is suppressed by the anti-HLA-DP antibody. Furthermore, HLA-DPB1*0501/*0501-positive mononuclear cells were used to perform the growth assay. As a control, a peripheral blood mononuclear cell from an HLA-DPB1*0501-negative subject was also used. The results are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. It was confirmed that an HLA-DPB1*0501/*0501-positive mononuclear cells were activated by a signal through the WT1 peptide and HLA-DPB1*0501, and grown. It was further confirmed that the growth is specific for HLA-DPB1*0501, because it is suppressed by the anti-HLA-DP antibody. Furthermore, the growth assay of the E15.2 cells was performed with various concentrations of the WT1 peptide. The concentration of the used WT1 peptide was 0.08, 0.4, 2, 10, 50, 100 or 150 µg/ml. The results are shown in Fig. 10. It was confirmed that the WT1 peptides grow the E15.2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.
