N-[4-(2-Furyl)-5-(tetrahydropyran-4-carbonyl)thiazol-2-yl)-6-vinylpyridine-3-carboxamide (compound (IE))
step 1 Methyl 6-chloronicotinate (1.51 g, 8.79 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (35 mL), vinyltributyltin (3.32 mL, 11.4 mmol), dichlorobis(tri-o-tolylphosphine)palladium (206 mg, 0.262 mmol) and lithium chloride (554 mg, 13.1 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred at 100Â°C for 2 hr. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, and an aqueous potassium fluoride solution was added thereto. The mixture was filtered through Celite and the residue was washed with ethyl acetate. To the obtained filtrate was added a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=70:30) to give methyl 6-vinylnicotinate (1.22 g, 85%) as a colorless transparent oil.
