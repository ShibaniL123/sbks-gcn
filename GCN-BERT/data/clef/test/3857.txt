Prodrug of Example 3: (8-Chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-2-yl)methyl dihydrogen phosphate
Step 1: 2-(((tert-Butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-8-chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
A mixture of 2-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-5,8-dichloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (3.5 g, 6.94 mmol), (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methanol (4.59 g, 34.7 mmol), K2CO3 (2.88 g, 20.82 mmol) and DMAP (0.848 g, 6.94 mmol) in ACN (40 mL) was heated at 80Â° C. overnight. The reaction mixture was filtered off and washed with ACN. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (10-50% EtOAc in heptane) to give the title compound (2.99 g, 72% yield).
