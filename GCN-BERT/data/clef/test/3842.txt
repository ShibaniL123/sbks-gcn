Example 9: Synthesis of 4-isobutoxy-N-(3-methyl-1-(quinolin-5-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzenesulfonamide
a) To a stirring solution of isobutoxybenzene (0.60 g, 4.0 mmol) in dichloromethane (5 mL) at −45° C. was added chlorosulfonic acid (0.6 mL, 9.1 mmol) dropwise, and the reaction mixture was stirred at −45° C. for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then warmed to 0° C. and additional chlorosulfonic acid (0.6 mL, 9.1 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 0° C. for 1 h and poured into ice. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by flash chromatography (SiO2, 5-10% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to give 4-isobutoxybenzene-1-sulfonyl chloride (0.32 g, 1.1 mmol, 28%).
