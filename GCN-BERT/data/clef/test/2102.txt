Such an amount can vary within a wide range depending on the target, particularly fungus, to be controlled, the type of crop, the climatic conditions and the compounds included in the composition according to the invention. This amount can be determined by systematic field trials, that are within the capabilities of a person skilled in the art. Thus, according to the invention, there is provided a composition, particularly a fungicide composition, comprising, as an active ingredient, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as herein defined and an agriculturally acceptable support, carrier or filler. According to the invention, the term "support" denotes a natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic compound with that the active compound of formula (I) is combined or associated to make it easier to apply, notably to the parts of the plant. This support is thus generally inert and should be agriculturally acceptable. The support can be a solid or a liquid. Examples of suitable supports include clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilisers, water, alcohols, in particular butanol, organic solvents, mineral and plant oils and derivatives thereof. Mixtures of such supports can also be used. The composition according to the invention can also comprise additional components. In particular, the composition can further comprise a surfactant. The surfactant can be an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent of ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surfactants. Mention can be made, for example, of polyacrylic acid salts, lignosulphonic acid salts, phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acid salts, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, substituted phenols (in particular alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (in particular alkyl taurates), phosphoric esters of polyoxyethylated alcohols or phenols, fatty acid esters of polyols, and derivatives of the above compounds comprising sulphate, sulphonate and phosphate functions. The presence of at least one surfactant is generally essential when the active compound and/or the inert support are water-insoluble and when the vector agent for the application is water. Preferably, surfactant content can be comprised from 5% to 40% by weight of the composition. Optionally, additional components can also be included, e.g. protective colloids, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetration agents, stabilisers, sequestering agents. More generally, the active compounds can be combined with any solid or liquid additive, that complies with the usual formulation techniques. In general, the composition according to the invention can contain from 0.05 to 99% by weight of active compound, preferably 10 to 70% by weight. Compositions according to the invention can be used in various forms such as aerosol dispenser, capsule suspension, cold fogging concentrate, dustable powder, emulsifiable concentrate, emulsion oil in water, emulsion water in oil, encapsulated granule, fine granule, flowable concentrate for seed treatment, gas (under pressure),gas generating product, granule, hot fogging concentrate, macrogranule, microgranule, oil dispersible powder, oil miscible flowable concentrate, oil miscible liquid, paste, plant rodlet, powder for dry seed treatment, seed coated with a pesticide, soluble concentrate, soluble powder, solution for seed treatment, suspension concentrate (flowable concentrate), ultra low volume (ULV) liquid, ultra low volume (ULV) suspension, water dispersible granules or tablets, water dispersible powder for slurry treatment, water soluble granules or tablets, water soluble powder for seed treatment and wettable powder. These compositions include not only compositions that are ready to be applied to the plant or seed to be treated by means of a suitable device, such as a spraying or dusting device, but also concentrated commercial compositions that must be diluted before application to the crop. The compounds according to the invention can also be mixed with one or more insecticide, fungicide, bactericide, attractant, acaricide or pheromone active substance or other compounds with biological activity. The mixtures thus obtained have normally a broadened spectrum of activity. The mixtures with other fungicide compounds are particularly advantageous.

The fungicide composition according to the invention can also be used against fungal diseases liable to grow on or inside timber. The term "timber" means all types of species of wood, and all types of working of this wood intended for construction, for example solid wood, high-density wood, laminated wood, and plywood. The method for treating timber according to the invention mainly consists in contacting one or more compounds according to the invention, or a composition according to the invention; this includes for example direct application, spraying, dipping, injection or any other suitable means. The dose of active compound usually applied in the methods of treatment according to the invention is generally and advantageously from 10 to 800 g/ha, preferably from 50 to 300 g/ha for applications in foliar treatment. The dose of active substance applied is generally and advantageously from 2 to 200 g per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 3 to 150 g per 100 kg of seed in the case of seed treatment. It is clearly understood that the doses indicated herein are given as illustrative examples of the method according to the invention. A person skilled in the art will know how to adapt the application doses, notably according to the nature of the plant or crop to be treated. Furthermore combinations and compositions according to the invention may also be used to reduce the contents of mycotoxins in plants and the harvested plant material and therefore in foods and animal feed stuff made therefrom. Especially but not exclusively the following mycotoxins can be specified: Deoxynivalenole (DON), Nivalenole, 15-Ac-DON, 3-Ac-DON, T2- und HT2- Toxins, Fumonisines, Zearalenone Moniliformine, Fusarine, Diaceotoxyscirpenole (DAS), Beauvericine, Enniatine, Fusaroproliferine, Fusarenole, Ochratoxines, Patuline, Ergotalkaloides und Aflat6xines, which are caused for example by the following fungal diseases: Fusarium spec., like Fusarium acuminatum, F. avenaceum, F. crookwellense, F. culmorum, F. graminearum (Gibberella zeae), F. equiseti, F. fujikoroi, F. musarum, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. poae, F. pseudograminearum, F. sambucinum, F. scirpi, F. semitectum, F. solani, F. sporotrichoides, F. langsethiae, F. subglutinans, F. tricinctum, F. verticillioides and others but also by Aspergillus spec., Penicillium spec., Claviceps purpurea, Stachybotrys spec. and others. The present invention therefore relates to the use of compounds of formula (I) as herein-described for the reduction of mycotoxins in plants and part of plants, and to methods of combating phytopathogenic and mycotoxin producing fungi characterized in that compounds of formula (I) as herein-described are applied to these fungi and/or their habitat. The present invention therefore relates to the use of compounds of formula (I) as herein-described as insecticide, and/or nematicide. The method of treatment according to the invention can be used in the treatment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), e.g. plants or seeds. Genetically modified plants (or transgenic plants) are plants in which a heterologous gene has been stably integrated into the genome. The expression "heterologous gene" essentially means a gene which is provided or assembled outside the plant and when introduced in the nuclear, chloroplastic or mitochondrial genome gives the transformed plant new or improved agronomic or other properties by expressing a protein or polypeptide of interest or by downregulating or silencing other gene(s) which are present in the plant (using for example, antisense technology, co suppression technology or RNA interference - RNAi - technology). A heterologous gene that is located in the genome is also called a transgene. A transgene that is defined by its particular location in the plant genome is called a transformation or transgenic event. Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the active compounds and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, bigger fruits, larger plant height, greener leaf color, earlier flowering, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, higher sugar concentration within the fruits, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible, which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected. At certain application rates, the active compound combinations according to the invention may also have a strengthening effect in plants. Accordingly, they are also suitable for mobilizing the defense system of the plant against attack by unwanted phytopathogenic fungi and/ or microorganisms and/or viruses. This may, if appropriate, be one of the reasons of the enhanced activity of the combinations according to the invention, for example against fungi. Plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing) substances are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, those substances or combinations of substances which are capable of stimulating the defense system of plants in such a way that, when subsequently inoculated with unwanted phytopathogenic fungi and/ or microorganisms and/or viruses, the treated plants display a substantial degree of resistance to these unwanted phytopathogenic fungi and/ or microorganisms and/or viruses. In the present case, unwanted phytopathogenic fungi and/ or microorganisms and/or viruses are to be understood as meaning phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Thus, the substances according to the invention can be employed for protecting plants against attack by the abovementioned pathogens within a certain period of time after the treatment. The period of time within which protection is effected generally extends from 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days; after the treatment of the plants with the active compounds. Plants and plant cultivars which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which have genetic material which impart particularly advantageous, useful traits to these plants (whether obtained by breeding and/or biotechnological means). Plants and plant cultivars which are also preferably to be treated according to the invention are resistant against one or more biotic stresses, i.e. said plants show a better defense against animal and microbial pests, such as against nematodes, insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses and/or viroids. Plants and plant cultivars which may also be treated according to the invention are those plants which are resistant to one or more abiotic stresses. Abiotic stress conditions may include, for example, drought, cold temperature exposure, heat exposure, osmotic stress, flooding, increased soil salinity, increased mineral exposure, ozon exposure, high light exposure, limited availability of nitrogen nutrients, limited availability of phosphorus nutrients, shade avoidance. Plants and plant cultivars which may also be treated according to the invention, are those plants characterized by enhanced yield characteristics. Increased yield in said plants can be the result of, for example, improved plant physiology, growth and development, such as water use efficiency, water retention efficiency, improved nitrogen use, enhanced carbon assimilation, improved photosynthesis, increased germination efficiency and accelerated maturation. Yield can furthermore be affected by improved plant architecture (under stress and non-stress conditions), including but not limited to, early flowering, flowering control for hybrid seed production, seedling vigor, plant size, internode number and distance, root growth, seed size, fruit size, pod size, pod or ear number, seed number per pod or ear, seed mass, enhanced seed filling, reduced seed dispersal, reduced pod dehiscence and lodging resistance. Further yield traits include seed composition, such as carbohydrate content, protein content, oil content and composition, nutritional value, reduction in anti-nutritional compounds, improved processability and better storage stability. Plants that may be treated according to the invention are hybrid plants that already express the characteristic of heterosis or hybrid vigor which results in generally higher yield, vigor, health and resistance towards biotic and abiotic stress factors. Such plants are typically made by crossing an inbred male-sterile parent line (the female parent) with another inbred male-fertile parent line (the male parent). Hybrid seed is typically harvested from the male sterile plants and sold to growers. Male sterile plants can sometimes (e.g. in corn) be produced by detasseling, i.e. the mechanical removal of the male reproductive organs (or males flowers) but, more typically, male sterility is the result of genetic determinants in the plant genome. In that case, and especially when seed is the desired product to be harvested from the hybrid plants it is typically useful to ensure that male fertility in the hybrid plants is fully restored. This can be accomplished by ensuring that the male parents have appropriate fertility restorer genes which are capable of restoring the male fertility in hybrid plants that contain the genetic determinants responsible for male-sterility. Genetic determinants for male sterility may be located in the cytoplasm. Examples of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) were for instance described in Brassica species (WO-1992/005251, WO-1995/009910, WO-1998/27806, WO-2005/002324, WO-2006/021972 and US 6,229,072). However, genetic determinants for male sterility can also be located in the nuclear genome. Male sterile plants can also be obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering. A particularly useful means of obtaining male-sterile plants is described in WO-1989/10396 in which, for example, a ribonuclease such as barnase is selectively expressed in the tapetum cells in the stamens. Fertility can then be restored by expression in the tapetum cells of a ribonuclease inhibitor such as barstar (e.g. WO-1991/002069). Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may be treated according to the invention are herbicide-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to one or more given herbicides. Such plants can be obtained either by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such herbicide tolerance. Herbicide-tolerant plants are for example glyphosate-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate or salts thereof. Plants can be made tolerant to glyphosate through different means. For example, glyphosate-tolerant plants can be obtained by transforming the plant with a gene encoding the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Examples of such EPSPS genes are the AroA gene (mutant CT7) of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium (Comai et al., Science (1983), 221, 370-371), the CP4 gene of the bacterium Agrobacterium sp. (Barry et al., Curr. Topics Plant Physiol. (1992), 7, 139-145), the genes encoding a Petunia EPSPS (Shah et al., Science (1986), 233, 478-481), a Tomato EPSPS (Gasser et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1988),263, 4280-4289), or an Eleusine EPSPS (WO-2001/66704). It can also be a mutated EPSPS as described in for example EP-A 0837944, WO-2000/066746, WO-2000/066747 or WO-2002/026995. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate oxido-reductase enzyme as described in US 5,776,760 and US 5,463,175. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate acetyl transferase enzyme as described in for example WO-2002/036782, WO-2003/092360, WO-2005/012515 and WO-2007/024782. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by selecting plants containing naturally-occurring mutations of the above-mentioned genes, as described in for example WO-2001/024615 or WO-2003/013226. Other herbicide resistant plants are for example plants that are made tolerant to herbicides inhibiting the enzyme glutamine synthase, such as bialaphos, phosphinothricin or glufosinate. Such plants can be obtained by expressing an enzyme detoxifying the herbicide or a mutant glutamine synthase enzyme that is resistant to inhibition. One such efficient detoxifying enzyme is an enzyme encoding a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (such as the bar or pat protein from Streptomyces species). Plants expressing an exogenous phosphinothricin acetyltransferase are for example described in US 5,561,236; US 5,648,477; US 5,646,024; US 5,273,894; US 5,637,489; US 5,276,268; US 5,739,082; US 5,908,810 and US 7,112,665. Further herbicide-tolerant plants are also plants that are made tolerant to the herbicides inhibiting the enzyme hydroxyphenylpyruvatedioxygenase (HPPD). Hydroxyphenylpyruvatedioxygenases are enzymes that catalyze the reaction in which para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) is transformed into homogentisate. Plants tolerant to HPPD-inhibitors can be transformed with a gene encoding a naturally-occurring resistant HPPD enzyme, or a gene encoding a mutated HPPD enzyme as described in WO-1996/038567, WO-1999/024585 and WO-1999/024586. Tolerance to HPPD-inhibitors can also be obtained by transforming plants with genes encoding certain enzymes enabling the formation of homogentisate despite the inhibition of the native HPPD enzyme by the HPPD-inhibitor. Such plants and genes are described in WO-1999/034008 and WO-2002/36787. Tolerance of plants to HPPD inhibitors can also be improved by transforming plants with a gene encoding an enzyme prephenate dehydrogenase in addition to a gene encoding an HPPD-tolerant enzyme, as described in WO-2004/024928. Still further herbicide resistant plants are plants that are made tolerant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors. Known ALS-inhibitors include, for example, sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, triazolopyrimidines, pyrimidinyloxy(thio)benzoates, and/or sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinone herbicides. Different mutations in the ALS enzyme (also known as acetohydroxyacid synthase, AHAS) are known to confer tolerance to different herbicides and groups of herbicides, as described for example in Tranel and Wright, Weed Science (2002), 50, 700-712, but also, in US 5,605,011, US 5,378,824, US 5,141,870, and US 5,013,659. The production of sulfonylurea-tolerant plants and imidazolinone-tolerant plants is described in US 5,605,011; US 5,013,659; US 5,141,870; US 5,767,361; US 5,731,180; US 5,304,732; US 4,761,373; US 5,331,107; US 5,928,937; and US 5,378,824; and international publication WO-1996/033270. Other imidazolinone-tolerant plants are also described in for example WO-2004/040012, WO-2004/106529, WO-2005/020673, WO-2005/093093, WO-2006/007373, WO-2006/015376, WO-2006/024351, and WO-2006/060634. Further sulfonylurea- and imidazolinone-tolerant plants are also described in for example WO-2007/024782. Other plants tolerant to imidazolinone and/or sulfonylurea can be obtained by induced mutagenesis, selection in cell cultures in the presence of the herbicide or mutation breeding as described for example for soybeans in US 5,084,082, for rice in WO-1997/41218, for sugar beet in US 5,773,702 and WO-1999/057965, for lettuce in US 5,198,599, or for sunflower in WO-2001/065922. Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may also be treated according to the invention are insect-resistant transgenic plants, i.e. plants made resistant to attack by certain target insects. Such plants can be obtained by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such insect resistance. An "insect-resistant transgenic plant", as used herein, includes any plant containing at least one transgene comprising a coding sequence encoding: 1) an insecticidal crystal protein from Bacilus thuringiensis or an insecticidal portion thereof, such as the insecticidal crystal proteins listed by Crickmore et al., Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews (1998), 62, 807-813, updated by Crickmore et al. (2005) at the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin nomenclature, online at: http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/Home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/), or insecticidal portions thereof, e.g., proteins of the Cry protein classes Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1F, Cry2Ab, Cry3Aa, or Cry3Bb or insecticidal portions thereof; or2) a crystal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or a portion thereof which is insecticidal in the presence of a second other crystal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or a portion thereof, such as the binary toxin made up of the Cry34 and Cry35 crystal proteins (Moellenbeck et al., Nat. Biotechnol. (2001), 19, 668-72; Schnepf et al., Applied Environm. Microbiol. (2006), 71, 1765-1774); or3) a hybrid insecticidal protein comprising parts of different insecticidal crystal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as a hybrid of the proteins of 1) above or a hybrid of the proteins of 2) above, e.g., the Cry1A.105 protein produced by corn event MON98034 (WO-2007/027777); or4) a protein of any one of 1) to 3) above wherein some, particularly 1 to 10, amino acids have been replaced by another amino acid to obtain a higher insecticidal activity to a target insect species, and/or to expand the range of target insect species affected, and/or because of changes introduced into the encoding DNA during cloning or transformation, such as the Cry3Bb1 protein in corn events MON863 or MON88017, or the Cry3A protein in corn event MIR604;5) an insecticidal secreted protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or Bacillus cereus, or an insecticidal portion thereof, such as the vegetative insecticidal (VIP) proteins listed at: http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/vip.html, e.g., proteins from the VIP3Aa protein class; or6) a secreted protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or Bacillus cereus which is insecticidal in the presence of a second secreted protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or B. cereus, such as the binary toxin made up of the VIP1A and VIP2A proteins (WO-1994/21795); or7) a hybrid insecticidal protein comprising parts from different secreted proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis or Bacillus cereus, such as a hybrid of the proteins in 1) above or a hybrid of the proteins in 2) above; or8) a protein of any one of 1) to 3) above wherein some, particularly 1 to 10, amino acids have been replaced by another amino acid to obtain a higher insecticidal activity to a target insect species, and/or to expand the range of target insect species affected, and/or because of changes introduced into the encoding DNA during cloning or transformation (while still encoding an insecticidal protein), such as the VIP3Aa protein in cotton event COT102. Of course, an insect-resistant transgenic plant, as used herein, also includes any plant comprising a combination of genes encoding the proteins of any one of the above classes 1 to 8. In one embodiment, an insect-resistant plant contains more than one transgene encoding a protein of any one of the above classes 1 to 8, to expand the range of target insect species affected when using different proteins directed at different target insect species, or to delay insect resistance development to the plants by using different proteins insecticidal to the same target insect species but having a different mode of action, such as binding to different receptor binding sites in the insect. Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may also be treated according to the invention are tolerant to abiotic stresses. Such plants can be obtained by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such stress resistance. Particularly useful stress tolerance plants include: a. plants which contain a transgene capable of reducing the expression and/or the activity of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) gene in the plant cells or plants as described in WO-2000/004173 or WO2006/045633 or PCT/EP07/004142.b. plants which contain a stress tolerance enhancing transgene capable of reducing the expression and/or the activity of the PARG encoding genes of the plants or plants cells, as described e.g. in WO-2004/090140.c. plants which contain a stress tolerance enhancing transgene coding for a plant-functional enzyme of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage synthesis pathway including nicotinamidase, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenyl transferase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase or nicotine amide phosphoribosyltransferase as described e.g. in WO2006/032469 or WO-2006/133827 or PCT/EP07/002433. Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may also be treated according to the invention show altered quantity, quality and/or storage-stability of the harvested product and/or altered properties of specific ingredients of the harvested product such as : 1) transgenic plants which synthesize a modified starch, which in its physical-chemical characteristics, in particular the amylose content or the amylose/amylopecfin ratio, the degree of branching, the average chain length, the side chain distribution, the viscosity behaviour, the gelling strength, the starch grain size and/or the starch grain morphology, is changed in comparison with the synthesised starch in wild type plant cells or plants, so that this is better suited for special applications.
