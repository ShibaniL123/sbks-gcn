Biological Background Calcium channels are membrane-spanning, multi-subunit proteins that allow controlled entry of calcium ions into cells from the extracellular fluid. Commonly, calcium channels are voltage dependent and are referred to as voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC). VGCCs are found throughout the mammalian nervous system, where they regulate the intracellular calcium ions levels that are important for cell viability and function. Intracellular calcium ion concentrations are implicated in a number of vital processes in animals, such as neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, pacemaker activity and secretion of hormones. All "excitable" cells in animals, such as neurons of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nerve cells, and muscle cells, including those of skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles and venous and arterial smooth muscles, have voltage dependent calcium channels. Calcium channels are a large family with many genetically, physiologically, and pharmacologically distinct subtypes. Based on the biophysical properties of calcium currents recorded from individual neurons, two super-families have been described: High Voltage Activated (HVA) and Low Voltage Activated (LVA) calcium channels. Calcium currents referred as L-Type, P-Type, Q-Type, N-Type, R-Type are HVA and as T-Type are LVA. In particular, the term "L-type" was originally applied to channels with a large single channel conductance and long open time, and "T-type" was applied to channels with a tiny single channel conductance and a transient open time. Further exploration of functional calcium channel diversity identified the "N-type" channel expressed in neurons and the "P-type" channel, which is the dominant type expressed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons and is pharmacologically resistant to known blockers of L-type and N-type calcium channels. From the molecular identity, ten distinct calcium channel subtypes have been identified, cloned and expressed and grouped in three families: Cav1 family (Cav 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4) is functionally related to the L-type Ca current; Cav2 family (Cav 2.1, 2.2, 2.3) is functionally related to the P/Q, N, R-type currents and Cav3 (Cav 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) family is functionally related to the T-type current. It is believed that calcium channels are relevant in certain disease states. A number of compounds useful in treating various cardiovascular diseases in mammals, including humans, are thought to exert their beneficial effects by modulating functions of voltage dependant calcium channels present in cardiac and/or vascular smooth muscle. Compounds with activity against calcium channels have also been implicated for the treatment of pain. In particular N-type calcium channels (Cav2.2), responsible for the regulation of neurotransmitter release, are thought to play a significant role in nociceptive transmission, both due to their tissue distribution as well as from the results of several pharmacological studies. N-type calcium channels were found up-regulated in the ipsilateral dorsal horn in neuropathic pain models of injury (Cizkova D., Marsala J., Lukacova N., Marsala M., , Jergova S., Orendacova J., Yaksh T. L. Exp. Brain Res. (2002) 147: 456-463). Specific N-type calcium channel blockers were shown to be effective in reducing pain responses in neuropathic pain models (Mattews E. A., Dickenson A. H. Pain (2001) 92: 235-246), in the phase II of the formalin test (Diaz A., Dickenson A. H. Pain (1997) 69: 93-100) and the hyperalgesia initiated by knee joint inflammation (Nebe J., Vanegas H., Schaible H. G. Exp.Brain Res. (1998) 120: 61-69). Mutant mice, lacking the N-type calcium channels, were found to have a decreased response to persistent pain as seen by a decrease in pain response during phase II of the formalin test (Kim C., Jun K., Lee T., Kim S. S., Mcenery M. W., Chin H., Kim H. L, Park J. M., Kim D. K., Jung S. J., Kim J., Shin H. S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. (2001) 18: 235-245; Hatakeyama S., Wakamori M, Ino M., Miyamoto N., Takahashi E., Yoshinaga T., Sawada K., Imoto K., Tanaka I., Yoshizawa T., Nishizawa Y., Mori Y., Nidome T., Shoji S. Neuroreport (2001) 12 : 2423-2427) as well as to neuropathic pain, assessed by a decrease in mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the spinal nerve ligation model. Interestingly, these mice also showed lower levels of anxiety when compared to wild type (Saegusa H., Kurihara T., Zong S., Kazuno A., Matsuda Y. Nonaka T., Han W., Toriyama H., Tanabe T., EMBO J. (2001) 20: 2349-2356). The involvement of N-type calcium channels in pain has been further validated in the clinic by ziconotide, a peptide derived from the venom of the marine snail, Conus Magnus. A limitation in the therapeutic use of this peptide is that it has to be administered intrathecally in humans (Bowersox S. S. and Luther R. Toxicon, (1998) 36: 1651-1658). Sodium channels play an important role in the neuronal network by transmitting electrical impulses rapidly throughout cells and cell networks, thereby coordinating higher processes ranging from locomotion to cognition. These channels are large transmembrane proteins, which are able to switch between different states to enable selective permeability for sodium ions. For this process an action potential is needed to depolarize the membrane, and hence these channels are voltage-gated. In the past few years a much better understanding of sodium channels and drugs interacting with them has been developed. Voltage-gated sodium channels were originally classified based on their sensitivity to tetrodotoxin, from low nanomolar (Tetrodotoxin sensitive, TTXs) to high micromolar (Tetrodotoxin resistant, TTXr). So far, 10 different sodium channel α subunits have been identified and classified as Nav1.1 to Nav1.9. Nav1.1 to Nav1.4, Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 are TTXs, whereas Nav1.5, Nav1.8 and Nav.1.9 are TTXr, with different degrees of sensitivity. Nav1.1 to Nav1.3 and Nav1.6, are primarily expressed in the CNS, whereas Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 are mainly expressed in muscle (skeletal and heart respectively) and Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 are predominantly expressed in small DRGs. It has become clear that a number of drugs having an unknown mechanism of action actually act by modulating sodium channel conductance, including local anaesthetics, class I antiarrhythmics and anticonvulsants. Neuronal sodium channel blockers have found application with their use in the treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin and carbamazepine), bipolar disorder (lamotrigine), preventing neurodegeneration, and in reducing neuropathic pain. Various anti-epileptic drugs that stabilize neuronal excitability are effective in neuropathic pain (gabapentin, carbamazepine). In addition, an increase in sodium channel expression or activity has also been observed in several models of inflammatory pain, suggesting a role of sodium channels in inflammatory pain. All together these findings indicate that compounds with sodium and/or calcium channel blockade have a high therapeutic potential in preventing, alleviating and curing a wide range of pathologies, including neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, urogenital and gastrointestinal diseases, where the above mechanisms have been described as playing a pathological role. There are many papers and patents which describe sodium channel and/or calcium channel modulators or antagonists for the treatment or modulation of a plethora of disorders, such as their use as local anaesthetics, antiarrhythmics, antiemetics, antimanic anti-depressants, agents for the treatment of unipolar depression, cardiovascular diseases, urinary incontinence, diarrhoea, inflammation, epilepsy, neurodegenerative conditions, nerve cell death, neuropathic pain, migraine, acute hyperalgesia and inflammation, renal disease, allergy, asthma, bronchospasm, dysmenorrhea, esophageal spasm, glaucoma, urinary tract disorders, gastrointestinal motility disorders, premature labour, obesity.

WO04/087125 discloses amino acid derivatives as inhibitors of mammalian sodium channels, useful in the treatment of chronic and acute pain, tinnitus, bowel disorders, bladder dysfunction and demyelinating diseases. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme present in the outer mitochondrial membrane of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Two isoforms of MAO exist: MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO enzymes are responsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenous and xenobiotic amines, and have a different substrate preference, inhibitor specificity, and tissue distribution. For MAO-A serotonin, noradrenaline and adrenaline are preferential substrates, and clorgyline is a selective MAO-A inhibitor; whereas MAO-B prefers β-phenylethylamine as a substrate, and is almost selectively inhibited by selegiline. Dopamine, tyramine and tryptamine are oxidized by both MAO-A and MAO-B, in particular in human brain dopamine is deaminated by 80% by MAO-B. MAO inhibition allows endogenous and exogenous substrates to accumulate and may thereby, when almost fully inhibited (>90%), alter the dynamics of regular monoamine transmitters. MAO regulate the concentrations in the brain of the most important neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine which are related to emotion, anxiety and movement. Thus, it is thought that MAO be closely linked to various psychiatric and neurological disorders such as depression, anxiety and Parkinson's disease (PD). MAO-A inhibitors are mainly used in psychiatry for the treatment of major, refractory and atypical depression as a consequence of their ability to increase the reduced serotonin and noradrenalin brain levels. More recently, MAO-A inhibitors have been used to treat patients with anxiety disorders such as social phobia, panic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. MAO-B inhibitors are mainly used in neurology for the treatment of PD. There is also recent evidence and interest in the role of MAO-B in other pathological conditions such as Alzheimer disease (AD). So far no evidence have been reported on MAO-B involvement in the metabolism of co-transmitters, such as colecystokinin, substance P, somatostatin and neurotensin, which are involved in the modulation of pain sensation. For this reason there is no scientific rationale for the use of MAO-B inhibitors in pain syndromes. Adverse drug reactions during clinical practice with MAO inhibitors have been reported. First generation of non-selective and irreversible MAO inhibitors, such as tranylcypromide and phenelzine, have serious side effects, including hepatotoxicity, orthostatic hypotension and most importantly hypertensive crisis that occurs following the ingestion of foods containing tyramine (Cooper AJ.-Tyramine and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors in clinical practice.- Br J Psych Suppl 1989:38-45). When these non-selective and irreversible MAO inhibitors are used, a strict tyramine-reduced diet must be observed. The pressor sensitivity towards tyramine is normalized 4 weeks after cessation of tranylcypromine therapy and more than 11 weeks after cessation of phenelzine therapy. Selegiline, a almost selective and irreversible MAO-B inhibitor, especially when used in combination with levodopa, can cause anorexia/nausea, dry mouth, dyskinesia and orthostatic hypotension in patients with PD, the latter being most problematic (Volz H.P. and Gleiter C.H.- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors. A perspective on their use in the elderly.- Drugs Aging 13 (1998), pp. 341-355). In monotherapy, anorexia/nausea, musculoskeletal injuries, and cardiac arrhytmias occurred more often in patients receiving selegiline compared with those receiving placebo. Apart from these adverse effects, increased rates of elevated serum AST and ALT levels were noted. The most frequently reported adverse effect of moclobemide, a selective and reversible MAO-A inhibitor, are sleep disturbances, increased anxiety, restlessness, and headache. The combination of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and moclobemide has good efficacy in cases of refractory depression, but has created controversy as to whether toxic side effects, such as serotonergic syndrome, result from this combination (Baumann P.-Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Clin Pharmacokinet 31 (1996), pp 444-469). Because of cardiac arrhythmias and increased liver enzyme levels, electrocardiogram and laboratory values should be checked regularly. Many types of physiologic changes that occur with aging affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MAO inhibitors. Indeed, pharmacokinetic variables in the elderly are markedly different form those in younger patients. These variables including absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion have to be taken into account to avoid or minimize certain adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Elderly patients are generally more susceptible than younger patients to side effects, including adverse drug reactions. Hypertensive crisis may occur more frequently in elderly than in younger patients, because cardiovascular systems of the elderly are already compromised by age. The use of sympathomimetic drugs in combination with MAO inhibitors may also elevate blood pressure. In addition, compared with placebo, phenelzine was associated with a significantly higher incidence of drowsiness, tremor, dyskinesia, diarrhea, micturition difficulties, orthostatic effects, and adverse dermatological effects. It is interesting to note that in the elderly, headache is reported with a higher frequency than in younger patients during treatment with moclobemide (Volz H.P. and Gleiter C.H.- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors. A perspective on their use in the elderly. Drugs Aging 13 (1998), pp. 341-355). MAO inhibitors are sometimes prescribed for depression. Because of the potential risk of suicide, adverse drug reactions and toxicity due to overdose are important factors to consider when choosing an antidepressant. In addition, when MAO inhibitors are used in high dosage, adverse cardiovascular effects seem to increase considerably; and because MAO selectivity is lost with such high doses, tyramine can induce potentially dangerous hypertensive reactions. Acute overdose with MAO inhibitors causes agitation, hallucinations, hyperpyrexia, hyperreflexia and convulsions. Abnormal blood pressure is also a toxic sign, so that gastric lavage and maintenance of cardiopulmonary function may be required. Overdose of traditional non-selective and irreversible MAO inhibitors are considerably dangerous and sometimes fatal (Yamada and Richelson, 1996. Pharmacology of antidepressants in the elderly. In: David JR, Snyder L., editors. Handbook of pharmacology of aging. Boca Raton: CRC Press 1996). In the treatment of the affections wherein sodium and calcium channels mechanism(s) play(s) a pathological role and, in particular, of pain syndromes (either of neuropathic or inflammatory type) inhibition of MAO enzymes is of no benefits. The most clinically active anti-nociceptive drugs are devoid of MAO inhibition. On the contrary, MAO inhibitory side effects may impose at least two types of negative limitations. 1) Dietary: eating food with high tyramine content may cause severe, even life threatening increase of systemic blood pressure (the so called "cheese-effect").2) Pharmacological: pain is often treated with a combination of drugs such as opioid derivatives and tricyclic antidepressant. With MAO inhibitors such association is dangerous as it may cause the serotoninergic syndrome (agitation, tremors, hallucination, hyperthermia and arrhythmias). Thus, eliminating or significantly reducing MAO inhibitory activity in medicaments active as sodium and/or calcium channel modulators useful in preventing, alleviating and curing a wide range of pathologies where said mechanism(s) play(s) a pathological role, including neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, inflammatory, ophtalmic, urogenital and gastrointestinal diseases, is an unexpected and substantial therapeutic improvement versus compounds of similar efficacy but with the above mentioned side effects. Said improvement is particularly desirable for the medicaments active as sodium and/or calcium channel modulators useful, in particular, for the treatment of the pain syndromes. Taken into account these findings on MAO inhibitors and, in particular, lacking any evidence on MAO-B role in pathological affections like pain, migraine, cardiovascular, inflammatory, urogenital and gastrointestinal diseases, it might be conceivable that MAO-B inhibition should not be an essential feature for compounds indicated for the above pathologies, avoiding any possible side effects during chronic and/or long-term treatments. An advantageous solution to the above described problem would consist in providing medicaments which are "selectively active as sodium and/or calcium modulators" or are useful for the "selective treatment" of affections, disorders or diseases wherein the sodium and/or calcium channel mechanism(s) play(s) a pathological role. With this expression are intended medicaments which, when administered to a patient in need thereof in amounts that are effective in the treatment of the above said affections wherein the above said mechanism(s) play(s) pathological role, do not exhibit any MAO inhibitory activity or exhibit a significantly reduced MAO inhibitory activity, thus resulting in avoidance of side effects due to accumulation of endogenous and exogenous monoamine transmitters. It is a primary object of this invention the use of phenylethylamino derivatives for the manufacture of medicaments active as sodium and/or calcium channel modulators for the treatment of pathologies where the above said mechanism(s) play(s) a pathological role, said medicaments being substantially free from any MAO inhibitory activity or having significantly reduced MAO inhibitory activity and, therefore, having a reduced potential for unwanted side effects. Said use provides an improved selective resource for the prevention, alleviation and/or cure of the above said pathological affections. Description of the invention We have now found a new class of phenylethylamino derivatives highly potent as sodium and/or calcium channel modulators and substantially free from any MAO inhibitory activity or having significantly reduced MAO inhibitory activity and, thus, having potentially reduced side effects in preventing, alleviating and curing a wide range of pathologies, including but not limited to neurogical, psychiatric, cardiovascular, inflammatory, ophthalmic, urogenital and gastrointestinal diseases where the above mechanisms have been described as playing a pathological role.

For instance, single optically active enantiomers may be obtained from their racemates by chiral chromatography or by converting them into a mixture of diastereoisomeric derivatives, separating the diastereoisomeric derivatives and restoring the respective enantiomers. Diastereoisomers can be separated from their mixtures by means of conventional techniques based on their different physico-chemical properties, such as chromatography, distillation, or fractional crystallization. Pharmacology The compounds of the invention may be used for the manufacture of a medicament active as calcium and/or sodium channel modulator against disorders caused by dysfunctions of voltage gated calcium and/or sodium channels. The activity of the compounds representative of this invention was compared with that of our internal standard "ralfinamide" (S)-(+)-2-[4-(2-fluoro-benzyloxy)-benzylamino]-propanamide and/or "safinamide" (S)-(+)-2-[4-(3-fluoro-benzyloxy)-benzylamino]-propanamide. Such compounds are voltage-dependent blockers of the calcium and/or sodium channels with potencies in the low micromolar range as demonstrated by the blockade of the calcium and /or sodium influx (fluorescence assays) and by the voltage-dependent blockade of the currents (patch clamp techniques). The N-type and L-type calcium channel modulating activity of the phenylethylamino derivatives was measured through a fluorescence-based calcium influx assays (Table 1 for N-type and Table 2 for L-type) and through patch clamp techniques in constitutive and/or Cav 2.2 transfected cell lines (Table 4). The sodium channel modulating activity of the phenylethylamino derivatives was measured through a fluorescence-based sodium influx assay (Table 3), through patch clamp techniques in constitutive and/or Nav 1.3 transfected cell lines (Table 5) and in cortical neurons (Table 6). The MAO-B activity of the above compounds was measured by using a radioenzymatic assay (Table 7). The in vivo analgesic activity of the above compounds was assessed in the "rat complete Freund's adjuvant model" and in the "Bennett model of neuropathic pain in rats" (Table 8). The anticonvulsant activity was measured using the "Maximal electroshock test" in mice (Table 9). The anti mania activity was measured using the "Amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide-induced hyperlocomotion in mice" model (Fig.1). The anti-schizophrenia and anti-addiction activities were assessed using the "test of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia" (Table 10) and the "Cocaine-induced behavioural sensitization test" in rats. "Acute bladder irritation by acetic acid in rats" and "Intermediate bladder irritation by cyclophosphamide in rats" tests were used as models for urological diseases. The anti migraine activity was measured using the "migraine test" in rats. Such substances exhibit also "use and frequency-dependency", i.e. an enhancement of the block during a high frequency stimulation when there is a large accumulation of channels in the inactivated state, such as in neuronal pathological conditions. Functionally, the use-dependent block results in depression of neuronal activity at high frequency firing and with lower blocking capacity at normal firing rate suggesting that the compounds of this invention may selectively, depress abnormal activity of the calcium and/or sodium channels, leaving unaffected the physiological activity, thus decreasing CNS depressant effects (W. A. Catterall, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. (1987) 8: 57-65).

Example 44: TTXs-sodium channel influx assay ND7/23 rat dorsal root ganglion-derived cell line endogenously expresses a mixed population of TTXs sodium channels (such as Nav1.3 Nav1.2, Nav1.1, Nav1.6). These cells lack of TTXr sodium channels as shown by the absence of their respective transcripts. ND7/23 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with10% FBS and 1mM sodium piruvate. The cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/well on 96 poly-L-lysine-coated plates and further incubated for 18-24h before use. The Membrane Potential Kit Assay (Molecular Devices), based on a negatively charged fluorescent dye able to monitor changes in membrane potential caused by the sodium influx due to the channel opening, was used for the assay. Cells were incubated with the dye loading for 30 minutes at 25°C. Then, 100nM of the toxin Anemonia sulcata (used as enhancer of the channel opener response) alone or in the presence of TTX (as reference standard) or test compound were added for further 15 minutes. The fluorescence (excitation:530nm, emission: 565 nm wavelength) was measured before and after (40-45 s) the automated injection of the sodium channel opener veratridine (100 µM) using a Victor plate reader (Perkin Elmer). The inhibition curves were calculated from 5 concentrations, each in triplicate, and the IC50 determined using a linear regression analysis. The compounds of the present invention inhibit TTXs sodium channels with pharmacologically significant IC50 values. The results, obtained with some compounds which are representative of the entire class of compounds of the invention, compared with the internal standard ralfinamide, are reported in Table 3.

P., Marty A., Neher E., Sakmann B., Sigworth F. J. Pflugers Arch. (1981) 391: 85-100) on HEK293 cells expressing recombinant human N-type channels, obtained after transient transfection of h α1B (hCav2.2) + β1b + α2δ-1 subunits. Membrane currents were recorded and filtered at 5 kHz with an Axon Axopatch 200B amplifier and digitized with an Axon Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments, CA, USA). Voltage clamping of membrane potentials and data acquisition were controlled online with Axon pClamp8 software. Measuring and reference electrodes were AgCl-Ag electrodes. Cells had initial seal resistances of >1 GΩ and access resistances of 4.2 ± 0.2 MΩ. Cells were continuously superfused with extracellular solutions using a Biologic RSC-200. For calcium currents recording the control bath solution contained (mM): Choline chloride (70), MgCl2 (1), BaCl2 (20), TEA·Cl (50), Hepes (10), Glucose (10). Internal pipette solution consisted of (mM): CsCl (140), EGTA (10), MgCl2 (2), Hepes (10), MgATP (1), GTP Tris (0.3). Compounds were dissolved as 20 mM stock solutions in DMSO and then diluted to the final concentration in the external solutions. Voltage protocols and data analyses: A two-step protocol was used to determine the voltage dependence of the block: N-type current was activated by a 600 ms step pulse to +10 mV (test pulse) from a 5000 ms preconditioning potential of -110 mV (resting condition) or -50/-55 mV (half maximal steady-state inactivated condition), respectively. The amplitude of calcium current peaks evoked by the respective test pulses at a frequency of 0.06 Hz were measured before and after exposure to the test substance. Tonic block of currents was calculated as the difference between the peak calcium current measured at the end of a stabilization period in the control external bath solution and peak currents measured at the end of test substance perfusion period (when steady state is reached) divided by control peaks. Drug concentration-inhibition curves were obtained by plotting tonic blocks versus drug concentrations. Dose-response curves were fitted to the tonic block data, according to the logistic equation: y = A2+ (A1-A2)/[1+ (x/IC50)p]. A1 and A2 are fixed values of 0 and 1 corresponding to 0 and 100% current inhibition, x is the drug concentration, IC50 is the drug concentration resulting in 50% current inhibition and p is the corresponding slope factor. The compounds of the present invention inhibit N-type calcium channels with pharmacologically significant IC50 values.

Example 46: Patch clamp studies of sodium currents inhibition Cells and methods: Functional inhibition of the sodium currents was studied using whole cell patch clamp methods (Hamill O. P., Marty A., Neher E., Sakmann B., Sigworth F. J., Pflugers Arch. (1981) 391 (2): 85-100) on HEK293 cells expressing recombinant Nav 1.3 channels. Membrane currents were recorded as decribed in the example above. For sodium current recording control bath solution contained (mM): NaCl (80), Choline chloride (38), CaCl2 (1.3), MgCl2 (2), KCl (2), CdCl2 (0.4), NiCl2 (0.3), TEA·Cl (20), Hepes (10), Glucose (10). Internal pipette solution consisted of (mM): EGTA (10), NaCl (10), CaCl2 (1.3), MgCl2 (2), Hepes (10), CsF (130), MgATP (1). Compounds were dissolved as 20 mM stock solutions in DMSO and then diluted to the final concentration in the external solutions. Voltage protocols and data analyses: A two-step protocol was used to determine the voltage dependence of the block: sodium current was activated by a 30 ms step pulse to 10 mV (test pulse) from a 2000 ms preconditioning potential of -100 mV (resting condition) or -50 mV (half maximal steady-state inactivated condition), respectively. The amplitude of sodium current peaks evoked by the respective test pulses at a frequency of 0.06 Hz were measured before and after exposure to the test substance. Tonic block of currents was calculated as the difference between the Nacurrent peak measured at the end of a stabilization period in the control external bath solution and the current peak measured at the end of test substance perfusion period (when steady state is reached) divided by control peaks. Drug concentration-inhibition curves were obtained by plotting tonic blocks versus drug concentrations. Dose-response curves were fitted to the tonic block data, according to the logistic equation: y = A2+ (A1-A2)/[1+ (x/IC50)p].

Example 47: Inhibition of sodium currents in cortical neurons Cell Preparation and culturing: cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic Wistar rats (E17-E19). Brains of E17 / E19 rats were removed and placed in ice-cold Hank's solution (Hank's solution (Life tech.14170-088) + glucose 30% + Pen-Strep 100x (Life Tech. 15140-122) 100U-100µg/ml and Hepes-NaOH 5mM). Cortex were isolated, cut in small parts and washed twice with Hank's solution. The solution was removed except 1-2 ml and the tissue was mechanically dissociated. After the mechanical dissociation, 5 ml of complete DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium) (Gibco 41966-029) + FBS (Hyclone) 10% + Glutamine (Life Tech. 25030-024) 2mM + Pen-Strep 100U-10µg/ml were added, and cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. Supernatant was removed and 5 ml of complete Neurobasal medium was added (Neurobasal medium (Life tech.21103-049) + B27 (Life tech.17504-044) 2% + Glutamine 2mM + Pen-Strep 100U-100µg/ml). Cells were counted and diluted in Neurobasal medium to a concentration of 400000 cells per poly-D-lysine 5µg/ml treated Petri dish. Cortical neurons were used from day 6th till day 11th after plating, and once a week Neurobasal medium was changed. Whole Cell Patch Clamp Recordings: Experiments on cortical neurons were carried out using standard whole cell patch clamp methods (Hamill et al., 1981). Membrane currents were recorded and filtered at 5 kHz with an Axon Axopatch 200B amplifier and data digitized with an Axon Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments, CA, USA). Protocol playing and data acquisition were controlled online with Axon pClamp8 software. Measuring and reference electrodes were AgCl-Ag electrodes. A Sutter Instrument P-87 Puller (CA, USA) was used for pulling patch clamp pipettes with a resistance of 2-3 MΩ from Harward borosilicate glass tubes. Cells were continuously superfused with extracellular solutions, using a solution changer Biologic RSC-200. Solutions: Sodium current recording control bath solution contained (mM): NaCl 60, CholineCl 60, CaCl2 1.3, MgCl2 2, KCl 2, CdCl2 0.4, NiCl2 0.3, TEACl 20, Hepes 10, Glucose 10. Internal pipette solution consisted of (mM): CsF 65, CsCl 65, NaCl 10, CaCl21.3, MgCl2 2, Hepes 10, EGTA 10, MgATP 1. Voltage protocols and data analyses: cells were clamped at -90 mV, then a two step protocol was used to determine the voltage dependence of the block. Sodium currents were activated by a 30ms step pulse to -10mV (test pulse) from a 2000ms preconditioning potential of -110mV (resting condition) and a potential of ∼ -50mV (half maximal steady-state condition). Drug concentration-inhibition curves were obtained by plotting tonic blocks in the resting and depolarized condition, versus drug concentrations. Dose-response curves were fitted to the tonic block data, according to the logistic equation: y = A2+(A1-A2)/[1+(x/IC50)p]. A1 and A2 are fixed values of 0 and 1 corresponding to 0 and 100% current inhibition, x is the drug concentration, IC50 is the drug concentration resulting in 50% current inhibition and p is the corresponding slope factor. The compounds of the present invention inhibit sodium currents of cortical neurons with pharmacologically significant IC50 values. The results, obtained with compounds which are representative of the entire class of compounds of the invention, compared with the internal standard ralfinamide, are reported in Table 6.

The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 2220 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatant recovered. The pellet was homogenized and centrifuged again. The two supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 9250 rpm for 10 minutes at +4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in fresh buffer and centrifuged at 11250 rpm for 10 minutes at +4 °C. The resulting pellet was stored at -80 °C. In vitro enzyme activities assay The enzyme activities were assessed with a radioenzymatic assay using the substrates 14C-serotonin (5-HT) and 14C-phenylethylamine (PEA) for MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively. The mitochondrial pellet (500 µg protein) was resuspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). 500 µl of the suspension were added to a 50 µl solution of the test compound or buffer, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (preincubation) then the substrate (50 µl) was added. The incubation was carried out for 30 minutes at 37 °C (14C-5-HT, 5 µM) or for 10 minutes at 37 °C (14C-PEA, 0.5 µM). The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 ml of 37% HCl or perchloric acid. After centrifugation, the deaminated metabolites were extracted with 3 ml of diethyl ether (5-HT) or toluene (PEA) and the radioactive organic phase was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry at 90% efficiency. The amount of neutral and/or acidic metabolites formed as a result of MAO activity was obtained by measuring the radioactivity of the eluate. The activity of MAO in the sample, corresponding to a percentage of radioactivity compared with the control activity in the absence of the inhibitor, was expressed as nmoles of substrate transformed/mg protein/min. The results, as far as the MAO-B inhibition is concerned, obtained with some compounds which are representative of the entire class of compounds of the invention, are reported in Table 7.

Example 49: Complete Freund's adjuvant model of chronic inflammatory pain Monoarthritis was induced in rats (200 g weight) by an intra-plantar injection into the left hind paw of 100 µl of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) containing heat-killed and dried Mycobacterium tubercolosis in a mixture of paraffin oil and an emulsifying agent, mannide monooleate. The CFA injection produced an area of localized edema and inflammation starting from few h after injection, with a progressive reduction in the mechanical withdrawal threshold. Each animal was allowed to develop the arthritis over a period of 8-9 days before testing. Mechanical Allodynia Mechanical allodynia thresholds were determined according to the method of Chaplan et al. (Chaplan S. R., Bach F. W., Pogrel J. W., Chung J. M., Yaksh T. L. J Neurosci Methods (1994) 53: 55-63). Rats were placed in individual plastic boxes of 24 x 10 x15 cm on a mesh metal floor and allowed to acclimate for about 30 minutes before testing. A series of calibrated von Frey hairs (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) with logarithmically incremental stiffness ranging from 2.83 to 5.88 expressed Log10 of [10 x force in (mg)] were applied to the paw with a modified up-down method (Dixon W. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. (1965) 60: 967-978). In the absence of a paw withdrawal response to the initially selected hair, a thicker hair corresponding to a stronger stimulus was presented until a sharp withdrawal was recorded. The procedure was repeted twice. Each hair was presented perpendicularly against the paw, with sufficient force to cause slight bending, and held 2-3 s. The stimulation of the same intensity was applied five/six times to the hind paw at intervals of few sec. The mechanical threshold was expressed as Log10 of [10 x force in (mg)] indicating the force of the Von Frey hair to which the animal react (paw withdrawn, licking or shaking). The mechanical allodynia thresholds were measured before (pre-drug) and at 30, 60, 90,120, 240 and 360 minutes after the treatment. A 24 h threshold was also measured. The compounds of the invention were administered in a range of doses of 0,1 - 100 mg/kg. Example 50: Bennett model of neuropathic pain in rats Effects on neuropathic pain are tested in the chronic constriction injury model in the rat (Bennett,G.J. and Xie,Y.K., A peripheral mononeuropathy in rat that produces disorders of pain sensation like those seen in man, Pain, 33 (1988) 87-107). Under pentobarbital anesthesia (Nembutal, 50mg/kg, i.p.), unilateral multiple ligations are performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats (140-160g) at the right common sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is exposed by blunt dissection at the level of mid-thigh and four loose ligatures (5-0 chromic catgut) are placed around-the nerve taking care not to interrupt the epineural circulation. After operation, animals are allowed to recover for one week. Animals develop a cold allodynia which is stable for at least five weeks. Cold allodynia is tested on a metal plate cooled by a water bath to a constant temperature of 4°C. The animals, randomly assigned to groups of 10 for each test dose and vehicle, are observed for periods of 2 minutes before and after application of test compound and the number of brisk withdrawal reactions is counted. Several time points after application are tested. Percent maximal possible effect (%MPE) and standard error of the mean (SEM) of each time point is determined with the pre-test value used as 100%MPE. The area under the data (AUD) is calculated for the observation period and expressed as percent inhibition of vehicle control as shown in Table 8. Significance is calculated by paired t-test on the percent AUD values.

Animals and Apparatus: Male CD1 mice weighing 25 g were used. The procedure described by White et al. (White H. S., Woodhead J. H., Franklin M. R., Swinyard E. A., and Wolf H. H. Antiepileptic Drugs (1995) 4th ed: 99-110, Raven Press, Ltd., New York) was followed. An Ugo Basile electroconvulsive generator (Model ECT UNIT 7801) was used to deliver an electrical stimulus sufficient to produce a hindlimb tonic extensor response in at least 97% of control animals. The stimulus was delivered intra-aurally through clip electrodes in mice (0.7 s of a 40 mA shock, with a pulse train of 80 Hz having a pulse duration of 0.4 ms). The acute effect of compounds administered intraperitoneally or orally 15-60 minutes before MES induction were examined and compared with a vehicle control group. Ten mice were studied per group. Complete suppression of the hindlimb tonic extensor component of seizures was taken as evidence of anticonvulsant activity. The compounds of the invention were administered i.v., orally or intraperitoneally at the doses of 0,1 - 100 mg/kg. The results, obtained with a compound representative of the entire chemical class of the invention, administered i.v., 5 minutes before testing, compared with the internal safinamide, and reported in Table 9, demonstrate that these compounds are active as anticonvulsant drugs.

Combined effects of chlordiazepoxide and d-amphetamine on activity of rats in an unfamiliar environment. Nature 1966; 211:1312-3;. R. Arban, G. Maraia, K. Brackenborough, L. Winyard, A. Wilson, P. Gerrard, C. Large,. Evaluation of the effects of lamotrigine, valproate and carbamazepine in a rodent model of mania Behavioural Brain Research, 158: 123-132).The model has been claimed to mimic some aspects of mania in bipolar disorder. Importantly, the hyperactivity induced by the mixture of d-amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide could be prevented by prior administration of the established mood stabilizer, lithium, as well as other mood stabilizers drugs (e.g. magnesium valproate and carbamazepine). Therefore, this model has face and predictive validity as a model of bipolar disorder and represents a valuable tool to determine, if a test compound could be a potential mood stabilizer drug candidate. Amphetamine (AMP) (2.5 mg/kg) plus chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (CDZ) (3 mg/kg/ip) were administered to male Albino Swiss mice (25-32 g) in a volume of 10 ml/kg. The locomotor activity was recorded using Opto-M3 System (Columbus Instruments) which is multi-channel activity monitor. Opto-M3 system has 10 infrared emitters and respective amount of receivers (0.5" beam spacing), attached to the PC computer and calculating both ambulatory activity and total counts. Thus the system differentiates forward locomotion (ambulation) from stereotyped like movement (total counts). Mice were pretreated with the test compound (5 mg/kg) and 10 min later, with AMP (2.5 mg/kg) or AMP jointly with CDZ (3 mg/kg). After successive 30 min. the mice were treated again with the same dose of the test compound and were placed individually in the motor activity cages. The locomotor activity (ambulation and total activity count) was evaluated for 30 min. Each group consisted of 8-10 mice. Statistical analysis: the data were evaluated by an analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed, when appropriate, by individual comparison with the control using Dunnett's test. Amphetamine-chlordiazepoxide administration induced a significant increase in locomotor activity. The effect of the compound 2-[[2-(3-Butoxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-(tetrahydrofuran-3-ylmethyl)amino]-N,N-dimethyl-acetamide hydrochloride, representative of the entire chemical class of this invention, was assessed as its capacity of preventing the amphetamine-chlordiazepoxide induced increase in locomotor activity as shown in Fig.1. Example 53: Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia method Cognitive impairment is often associated with schizophrenia and it has come to be recognized as a core element of the disorder, bearing on patient's recovery and re-integration into society. Particular interest has recently attracted a pharmacological model of cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia, which is based on the effects of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine (Javitt et al., 1991) which impair attention and increase "impulsivity" and "compulsive" perseveration in mice performing a complex task (Greco et al., 2005). Materials and Methods Animals: Male DBA/2N mice (Charles River, Italy) were used. The mice weighed 25-30 g at the start of the experiments, and were housed under temperature-controlled conditions (21°C) with a 12 h light 12 h dark cycle (light on 7:00 am-7:00 pm). Food (Rieper, Italy) was available ad libitum. The animals had two hours of access to water at the end of each day's testing. The five-choice serial reaction time task apparatus: The test apparatus consisted of four 21.6 x 17.8 x 12.7 cm chambers (Med Associates Inc. USA), as previously described [Greco, 2005 #26]. Stimuli and recording of responses, were managed by a SmartCtrl™ Package 8 In/16 Out (Med Associates Inc. USA) with additional interfacing by MED-PC for Windows (Med Associates Inc. USA). The running program for the 5-CSRT task was custom-written. Behavioural procedures: habituation to liquid reinforcer and nose-poking in the holes. Mice were handled for one week and their body weight recorded. They were then water-deprived by allowing them 2-h access to water in the early evening until their body weight had stabilised (8 days). Then, over the next two days the mice were habituated in their home cages to the reinforcer (10% sucrose solution) used afterwards in the operant procedures. On the following two days mice were habituated to the operant boxes. During this stage, 10% sucrose solution was available in a small bowl placed below the receptacle hole of the box. First, mice had to Team that every 5 sec the liquid reward was available in a small cup in the receptacle hole. During this period head entries were recorded. During the next period, mice were trained to poke their noses into the illuminated holes. Immediately after a poke in the water receptacle a LED at the rear of one of the holes was turned on. A nose-poke in the lighted hole extinguished the light stimulus and the liquid dipper provided a 0.01 mL liquid reward in the receptacle hole. Any response in one of the other four holes had no consequence and was not recorded. The light stimulus was presented in all five holes in random order. A mouse was switched to the 5-CSRT task after it had completed at least 50 rewarded nose-poke trials in one 30-min session. The five-choice serial reaction time task. The start of the session was signalled by illumination of the house-light and the delivery of a 0.01 mL liquid reward. Nose poking in the receptacle hole began the first trial. After a fixed delay (the inter-trial interval, ITI), the LED at the rear of one of the holes came on for a short period. The LED stimulus was presented the same number of times in each hole during a complete session, with the order of presentation randomised by the computer. While the light was on, and for a short period afterwards (the limited hold), responses in the hole that was illuminated (correct response) resulted in the liquid reward. Responses in the holes that had not been illuminated (incorrect responses) or failure to respond within the limited hold (omissions) caused the house-lights to be turned off for a short period (time out). Responses in the holes while the house-light was off restarted the time out. After the delivery of the liquid reward, or at the end of time out, the mouse started the next trial by poking its nose into the receptacle hole. Responses made in the holes after a correct response (perseverative responses), or after the end of time out before nose-poking into the receptacle hole, resulted in a period of time out. Responses in the holes during the ITI (anticipatory responses) also resulted in a period of time out. After anticipatory responses a nose-poke into the receptacle hole restarted the current trial. Each daily session consisted of 100 trials or 30 min of testing, whichever was completed sooner, after which all lights were turned off and further responses had no effect. In the first session of the test schedule, the stimulus and limited hold each lasted 1 min and, depending on individual performance, they were progressively reduced to 1 sec. The stimulus duration was reduced in the following sequence: 60, 30, 10, 5, 2.5, 2, 1.5 and 1 sec (baseline). The ITI and time out both lasted 2 sec during the first session and the ITI was raised to 5 sec in subsequent sessions; time out was not changed. Throughout the whole period of training and experiments each mouse had one session per day on a 5-CSRT task. Drugs and treatment schedules. The test compound was dissolved in water and was administered intraperitonealy (IP) at the dose of 10 mg/kg. Five minutes after the treatment mice were injected with vehicle (saline) or PCP (1.5 mg/kg) and 10 min later they started the test session. In each experiment the various combination of the test compound with vehicle or PCP were administered according to a Latin-square design. At least 48 h were left between the drug testing days. During these intervening days the mice were tested on the 5-CSRT task to re-establish baseline performance and to check for any residual effects of drugs. Statistical analysis: The main dependent variables selected for analysis were: (a) the percentage of correct responses (total correct responses/total correct + total incorrect responses x 100); (b) percentage of omissions (total omissions/ total correct responses + total incorrect responses + total omissions x 100); (c) the number of anticipatory responses in the holes during the ITI; (d) the number of perseverative responses in the holes after a correct response. Correct responses and omissions, as percentages, were transformed according to the formula 2arcsin(SQRT (%X/100)), to normalize the distributions in accordance with the ANOVA model (Winer, 1971). The effects of the test compound (n=12) on PCP induced deficits in the 5-CSRT task were analysed independently by a within subjects 2 x 2 ANOVA with factors Drug (test compound) and PCP. Subsequently the treatment group means were compared using a post-hoc Tukey-Kramer test. Statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., USA) was run on Micro VAX 3500 computer (Digital, USA). As shown in table 10, PCP caused a profound effect on attentional performance of DBA/2N mice as shown by increased anticipatory and perseverative responses. A representative compound of our invention, administred 10 mg/kg i.p., can reverse PCP-induced increase in anticipatory and perseverative responses. These results support the use of this kind of componds for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

One animal model of these behavioral changes is the long-lasting increase in locomotor activity induced by repeated administration of psychostimulant drugs in rodents (Robinson T. E. and Berridge K.C. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. (1993) 18, 247-91) known as drug-induced behavioural sensitization. The effect of test compounds were evaluated in a model of cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization in rat. Locomotor activity apparatus: Male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g upon arrival were used. Locomotor activity was measured in sixteen identical metal wire hanging cages each measuring 36 cm (L) x 25 cm (W) x 20 cm (H). Each cage contained two sets of infrared emitter-detector photocells positioned along the long axis 1 cm above the grid floor and 8 cm from the front and back of the cage. Background noise was provided by a white noise generator. Movement within the cages produced photocell interruptions, which were automatically recorded by an IBM-compatible computer. Sensitization procedure and treatment: Animals were habituated to the locomotor activity chambers for 2-3 consecutive days before the experiment. Rats received 5 daily i.p. injections of cocaine (15 mg/kg) or saline and either the test compound (0.1-100 mg/kg) or its vehicle and locomotor activity was recorded for 3 h. Ten days after the last injection of cocaine or saline (day 15), the animals were challenged with 15 mg/kg of cocaine in absence of the test compound and locomotor activity was again monitored for 3 h. By the fifth day of treatment with cocaine, animals pretreated i.p. with vehicle showed an increased locomotor response (20% higher then the first day, p < 0.05). Ten days after the last injection of cocaine or saline, the animals were challenged with 15 mg/kg of cocaine in absence of the test compound and locomotor activity was again monitored for 3 h. The rats previously treated with cocaine and that had not received the test compound are expected to show an increased locomotor activity response to cocaine (30% higher then first day, p <0.05). If the rats that had been pretreated with the test compound during the 5 day-cocaine treatment did not show an increase in locomotor activity the test compound is considered to have an effect in preventing psychostimulant drugs addiction. (Koob G. F., Sanna P. P., Bloom F. E. Neuron (1998) 21: 467-476; Robinson T. E., Berridge K. C. Brain Res Brain Res Rev (1993) 18: 247-291) Statistical analysis: Data (total number of beam breaks in 3 hours) were analyzed using a two way ANOVA with repeated measures on one factor including the four experimental groups (i.e., saline/vehicle, saline/test compound, cocaine/vehicle and cocaine/test compound) and two time points (day 1 and day 5) followed by a simple effects analysis. A second two way ANOVA with repeated measures on one factor was used to compare day 1 and the challenge day followed by a Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Example 55: Acute bladder irritation by acetic acid in rats Experiments were performed using adult anesthetized female Sprague Dawley rats (170-200 g). A catheter (PE-50) was inserted via a midline abdominal incision into the bladder through the bladder dome, and then intravesical pressure was measured to monitor bladder activity during continuous infusion of 0.15% af acetic acid. Continuous intravesical infusion of acetic acid irritates the bladder and reduces the intercontraction intervals (ICI) in anesthetized rats. ICIs, maximal contraction pressure, and pressure thresholds inducing reflex bladder contraction were measured before and after intravesical infusion of acetic acid in rats treated with compounds of the invention. Example 56: Intermediate bladder irritation by cyclophosphamide (CYP) in rats Experiments were performed using both adult awake and anesthetized female Sprague Dawley rats (170-200 g). Chemical cystitis was induced by CYP , which is metabolized to acrolein, an irritant eliminated in the urine. CYP (150 mg/kg/i.p.) was administred one day before the experiment. Pre-treatment with CYP causes bladder irritation and very frequent voidings with an ICI of about 150-200 seconds between voids. Active compounds increase the ICI in both awake and anesthetized rats used in this experimental model. Example 57: Migraine test in rats Animals and surgery: Male Wistar rats (250-350 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.) dissolved in saline. The trachea and left femoral artery were cannulated for artificial ventilation (55 strokes/min) and for measurement of mean blood pressure (MBP) respectively. The femoral vein was cannulated for the intravenous administration of test agents. Body temperature was maintained at 37-38 °C by automatic control of a heating pad. Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame and a longitudinal incision was made in the scalp. A burr hole was drilled in the skull and a stainless steel bipolar electrode (Plastic One MS 306) was lowered into left ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal ganglion (3.8 mm dorsal to bregma, 2.5 mm lateral from the midline and 9.5 mm below the dural surface) and secured with dental cement. Correct placement of the electrode was confirmed by a brief electrical stimulation, which cause movement of the jaw due to activation of the trigeminal fiber. Following removal of the brain, the correct position of the electrode into the fiber, was visually checked at the end of each experiment. A second hole was drilled ipsilateral of the electrode (1.5 mm rostral to bregma, and 1.5 mm lateral from the sagittal suture) and a needle probe (tip diameter 0.8 mm) of a laser doppler flowmeter was fixed pointing with its tip onto a branch of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) change recorded on-line by the PeriFlux 4001 Laser Doppler system. Artefacts of the laser Doppler reading during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion due to muscular movements were prevented by a bolus of i.v. injection of the neuromuscular blocker pancuronium bromide (0.6 mg/kg i.v.). Anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade were maintained all over the experiment with an infusion of sodium pentobarbital and pancuronium (12.5 mg/kg/h + 2.4 mg/kg/h, respectively). Experimental protocol: At the end of the surgery, a pause of thirty minutes was taken in order to stabilize the measured parameters. Rest CBF was increased by electrical stimulation with rectangular pulse of 0.5 ms length, 1-10 Hz, 0.5-1 mA for periods of 30 s. After two averaged pre-drug stimulations, vehicle or drugs were administered. Active compounds reduce the increase in blood flow induced by trigeminal stimulation.
