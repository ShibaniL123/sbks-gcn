BACKGROUND Cancer represents a significant burden on human health, accounting for an estimated 13% of all deaths each year. In particular, several common cancers and diseases are associated with androgen hormone signaling, such as, for example, prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, polycystic ovary disease. For example, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. The majority of prostate cancer deaths are due to the development of metastatic disease that is unresponsive to conventional androgen deprivation therapy. Androgen deprivation therapy has been the standard of care in subjects with prostate cancer since the 1940s. Despite androgen deprivation, most subjects ultimately experience disease progression. For many years this later phase of the disease was called “hormone insensitive prostate cancer” or “androgen independent prostate cancer.” It has since become clear that the prostate cancer that emerges after years of androgen deprivation therapy remains dependent upon androgen. The prostate cancer cells that have survived have gained the ability to import low levels of circulating androgens (expressed from adrenal glands), become much more sensitive to these low levels of testosterone, and actually synthesize testosterone within the prostate cancer cell itself. This stage of prostate cancer is now termed “castration resistant prostate cancer” or CRPC.

An adverse event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment administered. Adverse reaction: The term “adverse reaction” as used herein had its art understood meaning and refers to any noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose. Combination Therapy: The term “combination therapy”, as used herein, refers to those situations in which two or more different pharmaceutical agents are administered in overlapping regimens so that the subject is simultaneously exposed to both agents. Dosing Regimen: A “dosing regimen”, as that term is used herein, refers to a set of unit doses (typically more than one) that are administered individually separated by periods of time. The recommended set of doses (i.e., amounts, timing, route of administration, etc.) for a particular pharmaceutical agent constitutes its dosing regimen. Initiation: As used herein, the term “initiation” when applied to a dosing regimen can be used to refer to a first administration of a pharmaceutical agent to a subject who has not previously received the pharmaceutical agent. Alternatively or additionally, the term “initiation” can be used to refer to administration of a particular unit dose of a pharmaceutical agent during therapy of a subject. Pharmaceutical agent: As used herein, the phrase “pharmaceutical agent” refers to any agent that, when administered to a subject, has a therapeutic effect and/or elicits a desired biological and/or pharmacological effect. Pharmaceutically acceptable ester: As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable ester” refers to esters which hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Serious adverse event: The term “serious adverse event”, as used herein, has its art-understood meaning and refers to any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose, for example, results in death, is life threatening, requires insubject hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization), results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (defined as a substantial disruption of a subject's ability to carry out normal life functions), etc. In some embodiments, a serious adverse event is a “serious adverse drug experience”, as that term is used by the United States Food and Drug Administration, for example as defined in 21 CFR §310.305(b), which says that a serious adverse event is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, insubject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in insubject hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Susceptible to: The term “susceptible to” is used herein to refer to an individual having higher risk (typically based on genetic predisposition, environmental factors, personal history, or combinations thereof) of developing a particular disease or disorder, or symptoms thereof, than is observed in the general population. Therapeutically effective amount: The term “therapeutically effective amount” of a pharmaceutical agent or combination of agents is intended to refer to an amount of agent(s) which confers a therapeutic effect on the treated subject, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. The therapeutic effect may be objective (i.e., measurable by some test or marker) or subjective (i.e., subject gives an indication of or feels an effect). A therapeutically effective amount is commonly administered in a dosing regimen that may comprise multiple unit doses. For any particular pharmaceutical agent, a therapeutically effective amount (and/or an appropriate unit dose within an effective dosing regimen) may vary, for example, depending on route of administration, on combination with other pharmaceutical agents. Also, the specific therapeutically effective amount (and/or unit dose) for any particular subject may depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific pharmaceutical agent employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject; the time of administration, route of administration, and/or rate of excretion or metabolism of the specific pharmaceutical agent employed; the duration of the treatment; and like factors as is well known in the medical arts. Treatment: As used herein, the term “treatment” (also “treat” or “treating”) refers to any administration of a pharmaceutical agent that partially or completely alleviates, ameliorates, relieves, inhibits, delays onset of, reduces severity of and/or reduces incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a particular disease, disorder, and/or condition. Such treatment may be of a subject who does not exhibit signs of the relevant disease, disorder and/or condition and/or of a subject who exhibits only early signs of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. Alternatively or additionally, such treatment may be of a subject who exhibits one or more established signs of the relevant disease, disorder and/or condition. Unit dose: The term “unit dose” or “dose”, as used herein, refers to a discrete administration of a pharmaceutical agent, typically in the context of a dosing regimen. Definitions of standard chemistry terms may be found in reference works, including Carey and Sundberg “ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 4th ED.” Vols. A (2000) and B (2001), Plenum Press, New York, herby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of mass spectroscopy, NMR, HPLC, protein chemistry, biochemistry, recombinant DNA techniques and pharmacology, within the skill of the art are employed. Solid dispersion: The term “solid dispersion”, as used herein, refers to composition comprising two different components, generally a solid matrix with a secondary substance (such as an active pharmaceutical ingredient) dispersed within. Solid matrix: The term “solid matrix” refers to a solid phase in which molecules of a second substance (such as an active pharmaceutical ingredient) are embedded or dispersed within. Illustrative Biological Activity Androgen Receptor (AR) Androgens bind to a specific receptor, the androgen receptor (AR), inside the cells of target tissues. The AR is expressed in numerous tissues of the body and is the receptor through which the physiological as well as the pathophysiological effects of endogenous androgen ligands, such as testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are expressed. Structurally, the AR is composed of three main functional domains: the ligand binding domain (LBD), the DNA-binding domain, and amino-terminal domain. A compound that binds to the AR and mimics the effects of an endogenous AR ligand is referred to as an AR agonist, whereas a compound that inhibits the effects of an endogenous AR ligand is termed an AR antagonist. Binding of androgen to the receptor activates it and causes it to bind to DNA binding sites adjacent to target genes. From there it interacts with coactivator proteins and basic transcription factors to regulate the expression of the gene. Thus, via its receptor, androgens cause changes in gene expression in cells. These changes ultimately have consequences on the metabolic output, differentiation or proliferation of the cell that are visible in the physiology of the target tissue. In the prostate, androgens stimulate the growth of prostate tissue and prostate cancer cells by binding to the AR that is present within the cytoplasm of androgen sensitive tissue. Compounds which selectively modulate AR are of clinical importance in the treatment of or prevention of a variety of diseases, conditions, and cancers, including, but not limited to, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hirsutism in women, alopecia, anorexia nervosa, breast cancer, acne, musculoskeletal conditions, such as bone disease, hematopoietic conditions, neuromuscular disease, rheumatological disease, cancer, AIDS, cachexia, for hormone replacement therapy (HRT), employed in male contraception, for male performance enhancement, for male reproductive conditions, and primary or secondary male hypogonadism. Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Agents that block the action (antiandrogens) of endogenous hormones (e.g., testosterone) are highly effective and routinely used for the treatment of prostate cancer (androgen ablation therapy). While initially effective at suppressing tumor growth, these androgen ablation therapies eventually fail in almost all subjects, leading to “castration resistant prostate cancer” (“CRPC”). Most, but not all, prostate cancer cells initially respond to androgen withdrawal therapy. However, with time, surviving populations of prostate cancer cells emerge because they have responded to the selective pressure created by androgen ablation therapy and are now refractory to it. Not only is the primary cancer refractory to available therapies, but cancer cells may also break away from the primary tumor and travel in the bloodstream, spreading the disease to distant sites (especially bone). Among other effects, this causes significant pain and further bone fragility. It is contemplated that CRPC cells survive in an environment characterized by low levels of circulating androgens by amplifying at least three different pathways to enhance the response to the intracellular androgens that remain available. These include: (1) Up-regulation of the expression of the AR, which increases AR copy number and hence the sensitivity of the cells to low levels of circulating androgen induced by medical castration therapy; (2) Increase in the expression of enzymes involved in the importation of androgens that remain in cells after androgen deprivation therapy; (3) Increase in the expression of genes that regulate steroidogenesis, permitting the CRPC cells to synthesize their own androgens. A critical enzyme in the steroidogenic pathway is cytochrome C17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17), the enzyme that controls androgen production in the adrenals, testes, and prostate. Described herein, in certain embodiments, are compounds, methods of making such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and medicaments comprising such compounds, and methods of using such compounds to treat androgen receptor mediated diseases or conditions including, but not limited to, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hirsutism in women, alopecia, anorexia nervosa, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, polycycstic ovary disease, acne, musculoskeletal conditions, such as bone disease, hematopoietic conditions, neuromuscular disease, rheumatological disease, cancer, AIDS, cachexia, for hormone replacement therapy (HRT), employed in male contraception, for male performance enhancement, for male reproductive conditions, and primary or secondary male hypogonadism.

Compounds of Formula (III) may be synthesized by similar methods. As one of skill in the art would understand, the solvents, temperatures and reaction conditions presented herein may vary according to the practice and knowledge of those of skill in the art. The starting material used for the synthesis of the Compound (1) can be obtained from commercial sources, such as Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.), Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.), or the starting materials can be synthesized. The compounds described herein, and other related compounds having different substituents can be synthesized using techniques and materials known to those of skill in the art, such as described, for example, in March, ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 4th Ed., (Wiley 1992); Carey and Sundberg, ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 4th Ed., Vols. A and B (Plenum 2000, 2001), and Green and Wuts, PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 3rd Ed., (Wiley 1999) (all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety). General methods for the preparation of compounds as disclosed herein may be derived from known reactions in the field, and the reactions may be modified by the use of appropriate reagents and conditions, as would be recognized by the skilled person, for the introduction of the various moieties found in the formulae as provided herein. Compounds of Formula I-III can be prepared as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt (which is a type of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt) by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid, including, but not limited to, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, and the like; and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, tartaric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, arylsulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo-[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 4,4′-methylenebis-(3-hydroxy-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid), 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, and muconic acid. Compounds of Formula I-III can be prepared as a prodrug. Prodrugs are generally drug precursors that, following administration to a subject and subsequent absorption, are converted to an active, or a more active species via some process, such as conversion by a metabolic pathway. Some prodrugs have a chemical group present on the prodrug that renders it less active and/or confers solubility or some other property to the drug. Once the chemical group has been cleaved and/or modified from the prodrug the active drug is generated. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. Prodrugs may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a derivative of Formula (I-III), which is administered as a hydrophilic ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate absorption in the gastrointestinal tract where improved water solubility is beneficial, but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid and the active entity, Formula (I-III). A further example of a prodrug is a short peptide bonded to the hydroxyl group of Compound (1), wherein the peptide is metabolized to provide a compound of Formula I, II, or III. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. The design of prodrugs to date has been to increase the effective water solubility of the therapeutic compound for targeting to regions where water is the principal solvent.

Roche, Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, all incorporated herein in their entirety. Additionally, prodrug derivatives of compounds of Formula I-III can be prepared by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., for further details see Saulnier et al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985). Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. Indeed, some of the herein-described compounds may be a prodrug for another derivative or active compound. Sites on the aromatic ring portion of compounds of Formula I-III can be susceptible to various metabolic reactions, therefore incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures, for example, halogens, can reduce, minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway.

Pharmacokinetic Characteristics Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data can be obtained by known techniques in the art. Due to the inherent variation in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of drug metabolism in human subjects, appropriate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile components describing a particular composition can vary. Typically, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are based on the determination of the mean parameters of a group of subjects. The group of subjects includes any reasonable number of subjects suitable for determining a representative mean, for example, 5 subjects, 10 subjects, 16 subjects, 20 subjects, 25 subjects, 30 subjects, 35 subjects, or more. The mean is determined by calculating the average of all subject's measurements for each parameter measured. The pharmacokinetic parameters can be any parameters suitable for describing the present composition. For example, the Cmax can be not less than about 500 ng/ml; not less than about 550 ng/ml; not less than about 600 ng/ml; not less than about 700 ng/ml; not less than about 800 ng/ml; not less than about 880 ng/ml, not less than about 900 ng/ml; not less than about 100 ng/ml; not less than about 1250 ng/ml; not less than about 1500 ng/ml, not less than about 1700 ng/ml, or any other Cmax appropriate for describing a pharmacokinetic profile of Compound (1). In some embodiments wherein the active metabolite is formed in vivo after administration of a drug to a subject; the Cmax can be not less than about 500 pg/ml; not less than about 550 pg/ml; not less than about 600 pg/ml; not less than about 700 pg/ml; not less than about 800 pg/ml; not less than about 880 pg/ml, not less than about 900 pg/ml; not less than about 1000 pg/ml; not less than about 1250 pg/ml; not less than about 1500 pg/ml, not less than about 1700 pg/ml, or any other Cmax appropriate for describing a pharmacokinetic profile of a compound formed in vivo after administration of Compound (1) to a subject. The Tmax can be, for example, not greater than about 0.5 hours, not greater than about 1.0 hours, not greater than about 1.5 hours, not greater than about 2.0 hours, not greater than about 2.5 hours, not greater than about 3.0 hours, not greater than 5.0 hours, or any other Tmax appropriate for describing a pharmacokinetic profile of Compound (1). The AUC(0-inf) can be, for example, not less than about 590 ng·hr/mL, not less than about 1500 ng·hr/mL, not less than about 2000 ng·hr/mL, not less than about 3000 ng·times·hr/ml, not less than about 3500 ng·hr/mL, not less than about 4000 ng·hr/mL, not less than about 5000 ng·hr/mL, not less than about 6000 ng·hr/mL, not less than about 7000 ng·hr/mL, not less than about 8000 ng·hr/mL, not less than about 9000 ng·hr/mL, or any other AUC(0-inf) appropriate for describing a pharmacokinetic profile of Compound (1). In some embodiments wherein an active metabolite is formed in vivo after administration of Compound (1) to a subject; the AUC(0-inf) can be, for example, not less than about 590 pg·hr/mL, not less than about 1500 pg·hr/mL, not less than about 2000 pg·hr/mL, not less than about 3000 pg·hr/mL, not less than about 3500 pg·hr/mL, not less than about 4000 pg·hr/mL, not less than about 5000 pg·hr/mL, not less than about 6000 pg·hr/mL, not less than about 7000 pg·hr/mL, not less than about 8000 pg·hr/mL, not less than about 9000 pg·hr/mL, or any other AUC(0-inf) appropriate for describing a pharmacokinetic profile of a compound formed in vivo after administration of Compound (1) to a subject. The plasma concentration of Compound (1) about one hour after administration can be, for example, not less than about 140 ng/ml, not less than about 425 ng/ml, not less than about 550 ng/ml, not less than about 640 ng/ml, not less than about 720 ng/ml, not less than about 750 ng/ml, not less than about 800 ng/ml, not less than about 900 ng/ml, not less than about 1000 ng/ml, not less than about 1200 ng/ml, or any other plasma concentration of Compound (1). The pharmacodynamic parameters can be any parameters suitable for describing the present composition. For example, the pharmacodynamic profile can exhibit decreases in AR protein or endogenous androgens for, by way of example only, at least about 2 hours, at least about 4 hours, at least about 8 hours, at least about 12 hours or at least about 24 hours. The pharmacodynamic profile can exhibit an inhibition of androgen synthesizing enzymes, including CYP17, for, by way of example only, at least about 2 hours, at least about 4 hours, at least about 8 hours, at least about 12 hours or at least about 24 hours. The pharmacodynamic profile can exhibit reduction of androgen signaling, for, by way of example only, at least about 2 hours, at least about 4 hours, at least about 8 hours, at least about 12 hours or at least about 24 hours. In the current state of the art, compounds of Formula I are formulated as powder in capsule (PIC) formulations, in which the compound is in crystalline form, for oral administration. These formulations are associated with a number of limitations and potential safety profile issues. One existing concern regarding current formulations is the large variability in pharmacokinetics in subjects in a fed vs. fasted state. One exemplary current formulation exhibits widely divergent bioavailability in patients depending on their metabolic, e.g., fed vs. fasted, state. In particular, food has been reported to increase AUC 10-fold, and Cmax 17-fold, in patients. The large variability in bioavailability in subjects administered compositions comprising a compound of Formula I can lead to significant safety issues associated with unpredictable pharmacokinetics, particularly if taken with food. Due to these concerns, the formulation is indicated to only be taken in a fasted state (e.g., no food two hours before, or one hour after, oral administration). Therefore, in one aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising a compound of Formula I which is formulated to achieve similar pharmacokinetics when administered in a fed or a fasted state. Comparative pharmacokinetics of the compound in fed vs. fasted states can be assessed using a number of methods that are well known in the art. In one example, pharmacokinetics can be indicated in vitro by measuring solubility of the compound in fasted or fed state simulated gastric fluid (FaSSGF vs. FeSSGF), and/or in fasted or fed state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF vs. FeSSIF). In another example, pharmacokinetics can be indicated in vivo by conducting kinetic measurements of the amount of compound reaching the bloodstream after administration to live subjects that have been fed or fasted. In some embodiments, the live subjects used for comparative pharmacokinetics testing are animal subjects. In some embodiments, the subjects are mammals. In particular embodiments, the subjects are human subjects. In other embodiments, the subjects are non-human subjects such as, but not limited to canines, felines, non-human primates, rodents, birds, or reptiles. In some embodiments, the subjects are classified as being either in a fed or a fasted state. In some embodiments, a subject is classified as being in a fed state if the subject has ingested food from up to twelve hours prior to administration to four hours following administration. In particular embodiments, a subject is classified as being in a fed state if the subject has ingested food from up to six hours prior to administration to two hours following administration. In a particular embodiments, a subject is classified as being in a fed state if the subject has ingested food from up to two hours prior to administration to 1 hour following administration. Non-limiting examples of kinetic measurements taken from live subjects include CMax (maximum concentration of the compound found in the blood stream following administration), AUC (area under the curve, calculated by integrating concentration measurements of the compound in the bloodstream over time), or TMax (time at which peak concentration of the compound is achieved following administration). In some embodiments, AUCinf measurements are taken from subjects in a fed vs. fasted state. In particular embodiments, ratios are taken of the AUCinf-fed/AUCinf fasted measurements. In more particular embodiments, the composition is deemed to achieve similar pharmacokinetics when administered in a fed or fasted state if the AUCinf-fed/AUCinf fasted ratio is between 5-0.5, between 4.5-0.5, between 3.5-0.5, between 3-0.5, between 2.5-0.5, between 2-0.5, between 1.5-0.5, between 1.25-0.5, or between 1.20-0.75. In one embodiment, the composition is deemed to achieve similar pharmacokinetics when administered in a fed or fasted state if the AUCinf-fed/AUCinf-fasted ratio is between 1.25-0.75. In some embodiments, CMax measurements are taken from subjects in a fed vs. fasted state. In particular embodiments, ratios are taken of the CMax-fed/CMax_fasted measurements. In more particular embodiments, the composition is deemed to achieve similar pharmacokinetics when administered in a fed or fasted state if the CMax-fed/CMax_fasted ratio is between 5-0.1, between 4.5-0.1, between 4-0.2, between 3.5-0.2, between 3-0.3, between 2.5-0.3, between 2-0.4, between 1.5-0.4, between 1.25-0.5, or between 1.1-0.65. In one embodiment, the composition is deemed to achieve similar pharmacokinetics when administered in a fed or fasted state if the CMax-fed/CMax— fasted ratio is between 1.1-0.65. Another limitation of current compositions of the compound for oral administration is their limited bioavailability, which can necessitate larger doses. In another aspect, the present invention provides compositions with improved bioavailability compared to compositions comprising equivalent amounts of compound in crystalline form. Bioavailability can be indicated by pharmacokinetic parameters in in vitro models or in live subjects. Non-limiting examples of in vitro models and live subjects are described herein. In particular, in vitro models that provide useful indicators of bioavailability include, but are not limited to, dispersability in simulated gastric or intestinal fluid, dissolution in simulated gastric or intestinal fluid, or solubility in simulated gastric or intestinal fluid. Bioavailability can also be indicated by kinetic measurements taken from live subjects, examples of which are described herein. In some embodiments, improved bioavailability of the composition can be indicated by comparing the AUC of the composition compared to a micronized PIC formulation comprising an equivalent amount of compound in crystalline form. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention is formulated to achieve an AUC that is at least 2-fold higher than the AUC of a composition comprising an equivalent amount of said compound in a crystalline form. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention is formulated to achieve an AUC that is at least 5-fold higher than the AUC of a composition comprising an equivalent amount of said compound in a crystalline form. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention is formulated to achieve an AUC that is at least 10-fold higher than the AUC of a composition comprising an equivalent amount of said compound in a crystalline form. In some embodiments, improved bioavailability of the composition can be indicated by comparing the Cmax of the composition compared to a micronized PIC formulation comprising an equivalent amount of compound in crystalline form. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention is formulated to achieve a Cmax that is at least 2-fold higher than the Cmax of a composition comprising an equivalent amount of said compound in a crystalline form. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention is formulated to achieve a Cmax that is at least 5-fold higher than the Cmax of a composition comprising an equivalent amount of said compound in a crystalline form. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention is formulated to achieve a Cmax that is at least 10-fold higher than the Cmax of a composition comprising an equivalent amount of said compound in a crystalline form. In some embodiments, the invention provides a composition comprising a compound of Formula I that is formulated for rapid disintegration and/or dispersal in oral dosage form. Methods for determining disintegration and/or dispersal of pharmaceutical oral dosage forms are well known in the art. In some embodiments, the compositions are formulated for complete disintegration/dispersal in 15 minutes or less, 14 minutes or less, 13 minutes or less, 12 minutes or less, 11 minutes or less, 10 minutes or less, 8 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less, or 4 minutes or less. Another limitation associated with currently available compositions of Formula 1 is their limited solubility in intestinal environments compared to gastric environments. Intestinal fluid typically has a pH of about 5-7, while gastric fluid can have pH ranging from 1-2. In particular, the switch from a low pH (1-2) to a high pH (5-7) environment can cause the compound to precipitate and crash out of solution, thus greatly limiting their solubility in high pH environments and subsequent bioavailability. Therefore, in some embodiments, the invention provides compositions comprising a compound of Formula I that are formulated such that the solubility of the compound is maintained after switching from an environment of pH 1-2 to an environment of pH 5-7. In some embodiments, the solubility of the compound after switching from pH 1-2 to pH 5-7 is no less than 1/10 the solubility of the compound at pH 1-2. In some embodiments, the solubility of the compound after switching from pH 1-2 to pH 5-7 is no less than ⅕ the solubility of the compound at pH 1-2. In some embodiments, the solubility of the compound after switching from pH 1-2 to pH 5-7 is no less than ⅓ the solubility of the compound at pH 1-2. In some embodiments, the solubility of the compound after switching from pH 1-2 to pH 5-7 is no less than ½ the solubility of the compound at pH 1-2. In some embodiments, the solubility of the compound after switching from pH 1-2 to pH 5-7 is no less than ¾ the solubility of the compound at pH 1-2. In one aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising a compound of Formula I, wherein said compound is amorphous. By “amorphous”, it is meant that the majority of the compound in the composition is in an amorphous, that is, non-crystalline form. In some embodiments, about 50% or more, about 55% or more, about 60% or more, about 65% or more, about 70% or more, about 75% or more, about 80% or more, about 85% or more, about 90% or more, about 95% or more of the compound is in a non-crystalline state. In particular embodiments, about 80% or more of the compound is in a non-crystalline state. In yet more particular embodiments, about 90% or more of the compound is in a non-crystalline state. In one embodiment, 95% or more of the compound is in a non-crystalline state. Methods for determining whether a compound in a composition is amorphous are well known in the art, and include, but are not limited to Electron Microscopy, Polarized Light Microscopy, X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XPRD), Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC), or other standard techniques. In some embodiments, the compound in the composition remains amorphous for two weeks or more when stored under ambient conditions. The term “ambient conditions” generally refers to environments that are not artificially refrigerated, frozen, or heated. In some embodiments, the compound in the composition remains amorphous for two weeks or more when stored at room temperature.

Exemplary Pharmaceutical Compositions/Formulations A pharmaceutical composition, as used herein, refers to a mixture of a compound of Formula I with other chemical components, such as carriers, stabilizers, diluents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, and/or excipients. The pharmaceutical composition facilitates administration of the compound to an organism. Pharmaceutical composition containing a compound of Formula I can be administered in therapeutically effective amounts as pharmaceutical compositions by any conventional form and route known in the art including, but not limited to: intravenous, oral, rectal, aerosol, parenteral, ophthalmic, pulmonary, transdermal, vaginal, otic, nasal, and topical administration. One may administer the compound in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the compound directly into an organ, often in a depot or sustained release formulation. Furthermore, one may administer pharmaceutical composition containing a compound of Formula I in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with organ-specific antibody. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the organ. In addition, the pharmaceutical composition containing a compound of Formula I may be provided in the form of a rapid release formulation, in the form of an extended release formulation, or in the form of an intermediate release formulation. In some embodiments, the extended release formulation releases the compound for over 1 hour, over 2 hours, over 3 hours, over 4 hours, over 6 hours, over 12 hours, over 24 hours, or more. In some embodiments, the extended release formulation releases the compound at a steady rate for over 1 hour, over 2 hours, over 3 hours, over 4 hours, over 6 hours, over 12 hours, over 24 hours, or more. For oral administration, a compound of Formula I can be formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds described herein to be formulated as tablets, powders, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, elixirs, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject to be treated. Generally, excipients such as fillers, disintegrants, glidants, surfactants, recrystallization inhibitors, lubricants, pigments, binders, flavoring agents, and so forth can be used for customary purposes and in typical amounts without affecting the properties of the compositions. Non-limiting examples of fillers include lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, xylitol, calcium diphosphatc, and starch. Non-limiting examples of disintegrants include croscarmellose, sodium starch glycholate, crospovidone, sodium alginate, methyl cellulose, and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium. Non-limiting examples of glidants include magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, starch and talc. Non-limiting examples of surfactants include sodium lauryl sulfate, sorbitan esters, poloxamers, PEG block copolymers, and polysorbates. Non-limiting examples of recrystallization inhibitors include poloxamer 188, poloxamer 407, Povidone K-90, or hypromellose. Non-limiting examples of lubricants include magnesium stearate and calcium stearate Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by mixing one or more solid excipient with one or more of the compounds described herein, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. In some embodiments, the capsule comprises a hard gelatin capsule comprising one or more of pharmaceutical, bovine, and plant gelatins. In certain instances, a gelatin is alkaline processed. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, or gels formulated in conventional manner. Parental injections may involve for bolus injection or continuous infusion. The pharmaceutical composition of Compound (1) may be in a form suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. The compositions described herein can be administered topically and can be formulated into a variety of topically administrable compositions, such as solutions, suspensions, lotions, gels, pastes, medicated sticks, balms, creams or ointments. Such pharmaceutical composition can contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration of compounds having the structure of Formula (1) may employ transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches and can be lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions, dissolved and/or dispersed in a polymer or an adhesive. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Still further, transdermal delivery of a compound of Formula I can be accomplished by means of iontophorctic patches and the like. Additionally, transdermal patches can provide controlled delivery of a compound of Formula I. The rate of absorption can be slowed by using rate-controlling membranes or by trapping the compound within a polymer matrix or gel. Conversely, absorption enhancers can be used to increase absorption. An absorption enhancer or carrier can include absorbable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin. For example, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin. For administration by inhalation, the compositions of the present invention may be in a form as an aerosol, a mist or a powder. Pharmaceutical compositions of Formula (I) are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, such as, by way of example only, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The compound of Formula I may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as enemas, rectal gels, rectal foams, rectal aerosols, suppositories, jelly suppositories, or retention enemas, containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides, as well as synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, PEG, and the like. In suppository forms of the compositions, a low-melting wax such as, but not limited to, a mixture of fatty acid glycerides, optionally in combination with cocoa butter is first melted.

Spray Dried Compositions and Methods In some embodiments, the present invention provides solid dispersion compositions comprising a compound of Formula I: or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, N-oxide, active metabolite, prodrug, or solvate thereof; wherein R1 is H or acetyl; R2 is pyridyl or benzimidazolyl; and a solid matrix. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula I is dispersed in said solid matrix. In some embodiments, the solid matrix is comprised of a polymer. In some embodiments, the polymer is a water soluble polymer. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers used in solid dispersions include hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVPblock copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide ((K-25, 50 30, 90; PVP), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), methyl cellulose (MC), and polyethyleneglycol (PEG).

Non-limiting examples of polymers soluble in aqueous solutions of pH 5.5 or greater include sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC, sodium cellulose glycolate) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS). Other non-limiting examples of polymers suitable for use in solid dispersions include, e.g., of 3,4-dimethyl-phenomethylcarbamate (MPMC), hypromellose phthalate (HPMCP), Poloxamer 188, Poloxamer 407, Povidonc K-90, poly(meth)acrylates (Eudragit), homopolymers of N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, povidone, copovidone (Plasdone), carboxymethylethylcellulose (CMEC), cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), methacrylic copolymer LD (L30 D55), methacrylic copolymer S (S-100), aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer E (gastric coating base), poly(vinyl acetal) diethylaminoacetate (AEA), ethylcellulose (EC), methacrylic copolymer RS (RS 30D), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), HPMC 2208 (Metolose 90SH), HPMC 2906 (Metolose 65SH), HPMC (Metolose 60SH), dextrin, pullulan, Acacia, tragacanth, sodium alginate, propylene glycol alginate, agar powder, gelatin, starch, processed starch, phospholipids, lecithin, glucomannan, polyethyleneglycol (PEG) cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate (HPMCAT), and carboxymethylcellulose acetate butyrate (CMCAB). In some embodiments, the solid dispersion of the compound in matrix can be prepared by forming a homogeneous solution or melt of the drug and polymer, followed by solidifying the mixture, resulting in a solid composition of the compound dispersed in the solid matrix. In some embodiments, preparation of the solid dispersion comprises forming a homogenous solution comprising the compound, the polymer, and a solvent, followed by solidifying the mixture by removal of the solvent. In some embodiments, the solvent is an organic solvent or a mixture of more than one organic solvent. Non-limiting examples of organic solvents include dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, n-propanol, iso-propanol, butanol, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl iso-butyl ketone, propylacetate, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, toluene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, dimethylacetamide, and dimethylsulfoxide. In particular embodiments, the solvent is methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, 2:1 acetone:methanol, 2:1 methanol:tetrahydrofuran, 2:1 methanol:acetone, 6:1 DMF:water, 14:7:2:1 acetone:methanol:DMF:water, 4:1:1 methanol:water:acetone, 8:1 ethanol:water. Methods for removing the solvent from the mixture are known in the art, and can include freeze-drying, vacuum drying, spray-drying, or combinations thereof. In particular embodiments, the solvent is removed by spray-drying. The term “spray-drying” generally broadly refers to atomizing the solution into a spray of small droplets and rapidly removing solvent from the droplets using a spray-drying apparatus that facilitates rapid evaporation of solvent from the droplets. Spray-drying processes and spray-drying equipment are described generally in Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, pages 20-54 to 20-57 (Sixth Edition 1984). Solvent evaporation can be facilitated by, e.g., maintaining the pressure in the spray-drying apparatus at a partial vacuum (for example, 0.01 to 0.50 atm), contacting the droplets with a warm drying gas, or a combination of these measures. In some embodiments, spray drying comprises contacting the spray of droplets with a drying gas. In some embodiments, removal of the solvent by spray drying results in solid dispersion compositions in the form of particles. The particles can have a mean diameter of about 100 μm or less, about 95 μm or less, about 90 μm or less, about 85 μm or less, about 80 μm or less, about 75 or less, about 70 μm or less, about 65 μm or less, about 60 μm or less, about 55 μm or less, about 50 μm or less, about 45 μm or less, about 40 μm or less, about 35 μm or less, about 30 μm or less, about 25 μm or less, or about 20 μm or less. In some embodiments, the particles have a mean diameter of about 50-100 μm, about 30-75 μm, about 25-50 μm, about 20-30 μm, about 10-25 μm, or about 15-20 μm. Particle size can be measured using particle size measuring techniques known to those of skill in the art. Non-limiting examples of particle size measuring techniques include sedimentation field flow fractionation, photon correlation spectroscopy, laser diffraction or disk centrifugation. Another useful characteristic diameter of the droplets produced by an atomizer is D90, the droplet diameter corresponding to the diameter of droplets that make up 90% of the total liquid volume. In some embodiments, the particles of the composition have diameters spanning about 10-20 μm at D90, 15-20 μm at D90, or 17-19 μm at D90. In some embodiments, spray-drying results in compositions in which the compound of Formula I is amorphous. Methods and characterization of amorphousness are described herein. Exemplary Methods of Administration and Treatment Methods Compositions comprising a compound of Formula I-III can be used in the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of diseases or conditions in which steroid hormone nuclear receptor activity contributes to the pathology and/or symptoms of the disease. In addition, a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of Formula (1), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide, pharmaceutically active metabolite, pharmaceutically-acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically-effective amounts to said subject. The compositions containing the compound(s) described herein can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a subject already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease or condition, or to cure, heal, improve, or ameliorate the condition itself Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the subject's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. Once improvement of the subject's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease or condition is retained. Subjects can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms. In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer therapeutically effective amounts of at least one of the compounds described herein (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically-acceptable N-oxides, pharmaceutically active metabolites, pharmaceutically-acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates thereof) in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a subject upon receiving one of the compounds herein is inflammation, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-inflammatory agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may only have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the subject is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit of experienced by a subject may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the subject may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the subject may experience a synergistic benefit. Where the compounds described herein are administered in conjunction with other therapies, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s). In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is one of the compounds described herein) may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents may be provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents. Multiple therapeutic combinations are envisioned. In addition, compounds of Formula I-III may also be used in combination with procedures that may provide additional or synergistic benefit to the subject. By way of example only, subjects are expected to find therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of Formula (I) and/or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions. Compounds of Formula I-III and combination therapies can be administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus, for example, the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, preferably within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, more preferably within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, and most preferably within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. A compound is preferably administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from about 1 month to about 3 months. The length of treatment can vary for each subject, and the length can be determined using the known criteria. For example, the compound or a formulation containing the compound can be administered for at least 2 weeks, preferably about 1 month to about 3 years and in some embodiments from about 1 month to about 10 years. In other embodiments, the compound is administered once a day from 90 days to 2 years. The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compounds. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The daily dosages appropriate for any of the compounds described herein are from about 0.03 to 60 mg/kg per body weight. An indicated daily dosage in a larger mammal, including, but not limited to, humans, is in the range from about 1 mg to about 4000 mg, conveniently administered in one or more doses, including, but not limited to, up to five times a day or in retard form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from about 1 mg to about 4000 mg active ingredient. In some embodiments, a single dose of compounds of Formula (1) is within the range of about 50 mg to about 3500 mg. In some embodiments, a single dose of compounds of Formula (1) is about 90 mg, about 200 mg, about 250 mg, about 325 mg, about 500 mg, about 650 mg, about 975 mg, about 1300 mg, about 1625 mg, about 1950 mg, about 2600 mg or about 3250 mg. In some embodiments, an administration of compounds of Formula (1) of about 90 mg, about 325 mg, about 500 mg, about 650 mg, about 975 mg, about 1300 mg, about 1625 mg, about 1950 mg, about 2600 mg or about 3250 mg is given as multiple doses. In some embodiments, the single dose of compounds of Formula (a) is between 90 to 3500 mgs and the compound is administered to a subject for between 90 days to two years. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.

The supernatant of each formulation was diluted into FaSSGF and FeSSGF maintained at ambient temperature. The dilution ratio was 1:10 (v/v) for the fasted-state experiment and 1:20 for the fed state experiment. For 15 minutes, each dilution was agitated to ensure consistent movement of the liquid. A portion of the mixture diluted into FaSSGF and FeSSGF was mixed by vortex agitation to re-suspend any undissolved compound, if present, for a subsequent dilution into the corresponding fasted- or fed-state simulated intestinal fluid maintained at ambient temperature. The dilution ratio was 1:10 (v/v) for both fasted and fed states. The mixtures were agitated to ensure consistent movement of the liquid for 15 minutes. Upon removal from the rotator, all samples were centrifuged and a portion of the clear solution was added to a fixed volume of n-octanol. The samples were rotated overnight at ambient temperature to extract compound (1) into the n-octanol layer. The samples were centrifuged, and the resultant n-octanol solutions were analyzed by UV spectrophotometry. The results of the in vitro evaluation of the formulations are presented in Table 6. (Note: due to the emulsifying nature of the formulations, recoveries of greater than 100% are likely due to transfer of undissolved material).

Approximately 1.6 g of molten vehicle (Table 4) (melted in an 80° C. oven) was added to the vial; vehicles were vortex mixed thoroughly before dispensing. The vehicles solidified rapidly after addition to the compound (1). The resultant mixtures were heated to approximately 60° C. in a water bath to melt the vehicles and stirred on a stir plate to produce uniform suspensions containing approximately 20% (w/w) of compound (1). The compound did not completely dissolve in any of the vehicles. The stir bars were removed and the mixtures cooled in a water bath to speed solidification and reduce settling of the compound.

For the fasted-state experiment, a quantity of approximately 100 mg of sample was dispensed into a microcentrifuge tube, and a volume of approximately 1 mL of FaSSGF was added (a 1:10 (w/v) dilution). The samples were manually dispersed using a spatula before adding medium. Brittle vehicles such as #16 and #22 formed powders easily, whereas soft, waxy vehicles such as #13 could not be ground but were instead smeared in the tube to increase the surface area exposed to the fluid. The samples were briefly mixed by vortex agitation and placed on a rotator at ambient temperature for 15 minutes. The samples were again mixed by vortex agitation, and a 100 [EL aliquot of each suspension was diluted into 1 mL FaSSIF. These samples were briefly mixed by vortex agitation and placed on the rotator for 15 minutes at ambient temperature. The pH values of the SGF and SIF samples were measured. The fed-state experiment was performed in the same way, except a volume of approximately 1 mL of FeSSGF was added to a quantity of approximately 50 mg lipid solid dispersion (a 1:20 (w/v) dilution). The FeSSGF sample was diluted into FeSSIF as described above. Upon completion of each dilution experiment (incubation in simulated fluids for 15 minutes with agitation), the samples were centrifuged and a portion of the clear solution was added to a fixed volume of n-octanol. The samples were rotated overnight at ambient temperature to extract compound (1) into the n-octanol. The samples were centrifuged, and the resultant n-octanol solutions were analyzed by UV spectrophotometry. Note that most samples appeared as clear, uniform solutions rather than two layers; the FeSSIF samples each contained a small pellet after centrifugation. The results of the in vitro evaluation of the formulations are presented in Table 8. The recovery in SGF and SIF from each formulation was determined from the theoretical concentration, in mg/mL, in each SGF sample based on the mass of the lipid solid dispersion, the percentage of compound (1) in that formulation, and the volume of medium added.

The mixtures were dissolved in the solvent systems described in Table 9. Aliquots of 5-10 mL of each solution were distributed into 10 mL lyophilization vials. The headspace of each sample was briefly sparged with nitrogen gas, and the samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were placed on the freeze dryer, and all thawed rapidly. It is likely that most of the drying was achieved by solvent evaporation rather than freeze drying; even if some material was dried before the samples thawed, it may have been re-dissolved in the remaining liquid. The occurrence or extent of freeze drying cannot be confirmed or measured. After drying, the samples containing HPMCP and Poloxamers 188 and 407 appeared to be powdery, while the samples containing HPMC, HPMCAS, and Povidone K-90 appeared as glassy films coating the inner surfaces of the vials. Complete drying of the samples required two to three days. TABLE 9 Additives and solvents for solid dispersions of Method 1.

Preparation of Solid Dispersions—Method 2 Flash Freezing and Solvent Evaporation by Centrifugal Concentrator Approximately 100 mg of compound (1) and 400 mg of the specified additive (Table 10) were dispensed into each of five tubes. The mixtures were dissolved in the solvents systems described in Table 10. Aliquots of 1 mL of each solution were distributed into 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes. The samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, allowing the material to incubate for approximately five minutes to equilibrate to a lower temperature. The samples were opened and placed into the centrifugal concentrator at ambient temperature. Centrifugation and evacuation were initiated immediately. The samples did not remain frozen; however, the samples containing acetone dried by solvent evaporation in approximately two hours, and those containing ethanol dried after an additional 30 minutes at 60° C. The samples containing poloxamer were powdery, while the samples containing HPMCAS, HPMCP, and Povidone were glassy and brittle. TABLE 10 Additives and solvents for solid dispersions of Method 2.

In Vitro Assessment The performance of the solid dispersion formulations was evaluated in vitro by dilution into fasted- and fed-state simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. For the fasted-state experiment, a quantity of approximately 50 mg of sample was dispensed into a microcentrifuge tube, and a volume of approximately 500 μL of FaSSGF was added (a 1:10 (w/v) dilution). The samples were briefly mixed by vortex agitation and placed on a rotator at ambient temperature for 15 minutes. The samples were again mixed by vortex agitation, and a 50 μL aliquot of each suspension was diluted into 500 μL FaSSIF. These samples were briefly mixed by vortex agitation and placed on the rotator for 15 minutes at ambient temperature. The pH values of the SGF and SIF samples were measured. The fed-state experiment was performed in the same way, except a volume of approximately 500 μL of FeSSGF was added to a quantity of approximately 25 mg solid (a 1:20 (w/v) dilution). The FeSSGF sample was diluted into FeSSIF as described above. Upon completion of each dilution experiment (incubation in simulated fluids for 15 minutes with agitation), the samples were centrifuged and a portion of the clear solution was diluted as necessary and analyzed by HPLC. The results of the in vitro evaluation of the formulations are presented in Table 11. The recovery in SGF and SIF from each formulation was determined from the theoretical concentration, in mg/mL, in each SGF sample based on the mass of the solid, the percentage of compound (1) in that formulation, and the volume of medium added.

Example 2I Physical Mixtures Preparation of Physical Mixtures Approximately 100 mg of compound (1) was dispensed into a mortar. A quantity of approximately 400 mg of the appropriate additive (Table 12) was added. Each mixture was ground with a pestle until it appeared uniform by visual observation. The poloxamers were ground into fine powders, while the other additives, particularly HPMCAS and HPMCP, maintained larger and more varied particles. TABLE 12 Additives for physical mixtures.

Preparation of Spray-Dried Solid Dispersions FIG. 1 depicts a general workflow for preparing a spray dried dispersion formulation of TOK-001. Two processes are employed in the manufacture of the final TOK-001 drug product. In the first process, spray dried dispersions (SDDs) of the TOK-001 are prepared by mixing TOK-001 with a solid matrix polymer (e.g., HPMCAS) in a solvent, followed by spray-drying the mixture to form a spray dried dispersion (SDD) drug product intermediate (DPI). Optionally, the SDD DPI undergoes a secondary drying process to remove residual solvent. In the second process, SDD DPI is blended with encapsulation excipients and filled in capsules. SDD Feed Solution Development The solubility of the API was assessed in several common solvents systems to ensure obtaining the maximum API concentration for the spray drying process. Based on the data shown in Table 14 below, the solvent system 2:1, methanol:THF showed the highest API solubility and was originally retained as the binary system of choice for the spray drying process development. Subsequently this binary solvent mixture was changed to the 2:1, methanol:acetone mixture due to long secondary drying times observed with the 2:1, methanol:THF system. TABLE 14 API Solubility Assessment in Common Solvents Amount API Solvent System added (g) Solubility (%) Methanol 1.04 4.16 Ethanol 1.17 4.68 Ethyl Acetate 0.13 0 Acetone 0.26 1.04 Tetrahydrofuran 1.82 7.28 2:1 Acetone:Methanol 1.04 4.16 2:1 Methanol:Tetrahydrofuran 4.16 16.64 2:1 Methanol:Acetone 1.82 7.28 Spray Drying Parameters The optimum parameters used for the spray drying process for the 2:1, methanol:acetone with API (5.0%) and HPMCAS solution were based on the manufacturer's experience with the solvents and polymer used in this SDD application. To optimize the spray-drying process, various parameters of the spray drying process were tested and the resulting SDD particles assessed for bulk density, tapped density, mean particle size, and particle size distribution. Results from TOK-001: HPMCAS SDD samples are summarized in Table 15.

(0.8-1.2 bar) (75-90 kg/hr) Secondary Drying Following the spray-drying process, samples were vacuum dried in an oven at 50° C. and −25 in Hg. Samples were routinely taken intermittently during the secondary drying process of SDD lots or sublots and analyzed by gas chromatography for residual solvents (methanol and acetone). The drying process target value is <4000 ppm for acetone (ICH limit is 5000 ppm) and <2000 ppm for methanol (ICH limit is 3000 ppm). Following the drying process, TOK-001 SDD particles were further blended with excipients, then compacted into capsules or tablets. Table 17 depicts one exemplary capsule formulation for the TOK-001:HPMCAS SDD.

FIG. 2A depicts an XRPD plot of TOK-001:HPMCAS-SDD particles at TO after spray-drying, vs. micronized crystalline TOK-001, demonstrating that the HPMCAS-SDD composition is highly amorphous. FIG. 2B depicts an XRPD plot of TOK-001:HPMCAS-SDD vs. micronized crystalline TOK-001 after storage for one month at 40° C./75% RH, demonstrating that the HPMCAS-SDD composition remains highly amorphous for at least one month without reverting back to crystalline form. Pharmaceutical Formulation Testing A panel of recrystallization inhibitors were tested in the TOK-001:HPMCAS formulations. The impact of various recrystallization inhibitors on solubility of the TOK-001: HPMCAS SDD compositions in SGF and after transition from SGF to FaSSIF is depicted in FIG. 3. Results indicate that poloxamer 188 (Lutrol F68) greatly reduces the difference in solubility between SGF conditions and after transition from SGF to FaSSIF. Disintegration/Dispersability Following compaction into capsules using standard methods, disintegration/dispersability of the capsules in 0.1N HCl and IAW USP 701 were tested. Results are depicted in Tables 20-21.

Dissolution Testing Dissolution behavior and solubility enhancement was tested using the μDISS Profiler™ (Pion Inc.), a small-volume, 8-shannel in situ UV dissolution apparatus, to collect concentration-time profiles in biorelevant media (e.g., FaSSIF). 3 capsule formulations were tested: 325 mg TOK-001 as micronized PIC, 50 mg TOK-001 HPMCAS SDD, 50 mg TOK-001 copovidone SDD. Dissolution testing proceeded according to the protocol in Table 22. TABLE 22 Dissolution testing Apparatus USP Type-2 Dissolution Media FaSSIF Sampling Time Paddle Speed Temperature 5 Minutes 75 RPM 37° C. 15 Minutes 75 RPM 37° C. 30 Minutes 75 RPM 37° C. 45 Minutes 75 RPM 37° C. 60 Minutes 75 RPM 37° C. Note: Samples are analyzed by HPLC-UV absorbance at 264 nm in comparison to a reference standard of TOK-001 dissolved in methanol at 20 mg/100 mL. FIG. 4 depicts dissolution of the above three formulations as percent compound released into FaSSIF over time. The HPMCAS SDD formulation exhibits a 100 fold higher dissolution compared to the PIC formulation. By comparison, the copovidone SDD formulation exhibits a 15 fold higher dissolution rate compared to the PIC formulation. Canine Pharmacokinetic Studies. The oral exposure of TOK-001 in male Beagle dogs was evaluated after administration of various formulations of TOK-001. Subjects were fasted for 12 hours prior to administration. Blood samples were collected up to 24 hours post dose. Plasma concentrations were determined with a qualified LC-MS/MS method and pharmacokinetic parameters, summarized in FIG. 5, were determined for the TOK-001 plasma data. FIG. 6 depicts plasma concentrations of TOK-001 (referred to here as Galaterone) over time, comparing the TOK-001:HPMCAS SDD capsule formulation to the micronized crystalline PIC capsule formulation. Fed/Fasted Pharmacokinetics To test the pharmacokinetics of the HPMCAS SDD formulation, a human crossover trial was conducted in which human subjects were orally administered (1) HPMCAS SDD capsule containing 100 mg TOK-001 while in a fed state, (2) HPMCAS SDD capsule containing 100 mg TOK-001 while in a fasted state, and 2600 mg TOK-001 micronized powder in capsule (PIC) while in a fed state. Blood samples were taken at regular time points following each administration for up to 72 hours, and plasma concentrations of TOK-001 assessed. FIG. 7 depicts TOK-001 plasma concentrations over time for HPMCAS SDD-Fed, HPMCAS SDD-Fasted, and PIC-Fed. Subjects administered HPMCAS SDD in a fed state exhibit similar plasma concentration profiles as when administered HPMCAS SDD in a fasted state. Table 23 depicts a summary of pharmacokinetic data from oral administration of HPMCAS SDD-Fed, HPMCAS SDD-Fasted, and PIC-fed conditions. The summary demonstrates a ˜16% increase in AUC(inf) but a ˜22% decrease in Cmax when the HPMCAS-SDD formulation is given with food. By contrast, there is a ˜13-fold increase in AUC when the PIC formulation is given with food compared to PIC given in a fasted state.
