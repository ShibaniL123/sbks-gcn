Tert-butyl3-(1-ethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydrobenzo[cd]indole-6-sulfonamido)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate (50 mg, 0.112 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (20 mL) and trifluoroacetic acid (0.5 mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The solvent was removed and was purified by recrystallization with petroleum and ether/ethyl acetate to afford 1-ethyl-2-oxo-N-(pyrrolidin-3-yl)-1,2-dihydrobenzo[cd]indole-6-sulfonamide (37 mg, 95%) as a yellow solid.
