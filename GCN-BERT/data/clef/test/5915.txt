6-cyclobutyl-3-methoxy-pyridazine-4-carbaldehyde
Dess-Martin periodinane (CAS#87413-09-0, 213 mg, 0.50 mmol, 1.5 eq) was added to a solution of (6-cyclobutyl-3-methoxy-pyridazin-4-yl)-methanol (65 mg, 0.33 mmol, 1.0 eq) in dichloromethane (5 mL) at 0Â° C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature and was filtered over diatomaceous earth. The residue was washed with dichloromethane and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The crude mixture was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (heptane/ethyl acetate 100/0 to 80/20) to afford the title compound (56 mg, 87%). LC/MS (ESI+) m/z 211.3 (M+H2O+H)+.
