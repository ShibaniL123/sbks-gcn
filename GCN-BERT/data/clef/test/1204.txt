CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/917,323, filed Nov. 1, 2010, now U.S. Pat. No. 9,079,004, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/262,126, filed Nov. 17, 2009, and titled “Implantable Overmolded Access Port Including Anchoring Identification Feature,” each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BRIEF SUMMARY Briefly summarized, embodiments of the present invention are directed to an access port for providing subcutaneous access to a patient. In particular, in one implementation the access port is implanted in the patient's body, then is fluidly connected to a catheter that has been introduced into the patient's vasculature. So positioned and configured, the access port can be transcutaneously accessed by a needle or other infusion/aspiration device so as to administer medicaments to the patient's vasculature via the port and catheter, or to aspirate blood or other fluids therefrom. In one embodiment, the port includes an internal body defining a fluid cavity that is accessible via a septum. A compliant outer cover including silicone is disposed about at least a portion of the body. A flange is included with the port body and is covered by the outer cover. The flange radially extends about a perimeter of the port body proximate the septum so as to impede penetration of a needle a substantial distance into the outer cover, such as in instances where the needle misses the septum while attempting to access the port. In one embodiment, the flange of the access port can further include both an anchoring feature for securing the outer cover to the port body and an identification feature observable via x-ray imaging technology for conveying information indicative of at least one attribute of the access port. The outer cover also provides a suitable surface for application of an antimicrobial/antithrombotic coating. These and other features of embodiments of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of embodiments of the invention as set forth hereinafter.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED EMBODIMENTS Reference will now be made to figures wherein like structures will be provided with like reference designations. It is understood that the drawings are diagrammatic and schematic representations of exemplary embodiments of the present invention, and are neither limiting nor necessarily drawn to scale. For clarity it is to be understood that the word “proximal” refers to a direction relatively closer to a clinician using the device to be described herein, while the word “distal” refers to a direction relatively further from the clinician. For example, the end of a catheter placed within the body of a patient is considered a distal end of the catheter, while the catheter end remaining outside the body is a proximal end of the catheter. Also, the words “including,” “has,” and “having,” as used herein, including the claims, shall have the same meaning as the word “comprising.” FIGS. 1A-14B depict various features of embodiments of the present invention, which are generally directed to an access port for providing subcutaneous access to the body of a patient. In particular, in one implementation the access port is implanted in the patient's body, then is fluidly connected to a catheter that has been introduced into the patient's vasculature. So positioned and configured, the access port can be transcutaneously accessed by a needle or other infusion/aspiration device so as to administer medicaments to the patient's vasculature via the port and catheter, or to aspirate blood or other fluids therefrom. Further, in embodiments to be described herein, the access port includes a compliant outer cover that increases patient comfort upon implantation and provides for enhanced options for suturing or otherwise securing the port within the patient's body. In addition, the compliant outer cover in one embodiment includes a biocompatible material such as silicone that provides a suitable surface on which an antimicrobial and/or antithrombotic coating can be applied in order to reduce patient risk or infection as a result of implantation of the access port. Additional features of the access port include, in one embodiment, identification features for identifying an attribute of the port via x-ray imaging, and anchoring features for securing the outer cover to the internal port body. Reference is first made to FIGS. 1A-2D, which show various views of an implantable access port (“port”), generally designated at 10, according to one embodiment. As shown, the port 10 includes an internal body 12 that defines a bottom surface 14 and a fluid cavity 20 (FIG. 2A). An outer cover 16, to be discussed further below, is disposed about the body 12 to substantially cover it, with the exception of an opening 22 to the fluid cavity 20 and a penetrable septum 24 that is placed in the opening to cover the fluid cavity. In greater detail, the septum 24 in the illustrated embodiment is held in place within the opening 22 of the fluid cavity 20 by a retaining ring 26 that is inserted into the opening 22 to engage the port body 12 in an interference fit. The outer cover 16 covers the surface of the body 12 of the port 10 up to a circular region about the retaining ring 26, as best seen in FIG. 1C. The outer cover can include other configurations in addition to what is explicitly shown in the accompanying figures. In the present embodiment, the body 12 of the port 10 includes titanium or other suitable metallic material. In other embodiments to be described herein, the port body includes non-metallic materials. Additional details of the port 10 include a plurality of palpation features 28 included on a top surface of the septum 28 to assist in identification of the port after subcutaneous placement, and a fluid outlet 30 in fluid communication with the fluid cavity 20. A stem 32 defining a conduit is fixedly received within the fluid outlet 30 so as to provide a fluid pathway between the fluid cavity 20 and a catheter attached to the stem. As mentioned, the outer cover 16 includes a compliant material and covers the port body 12. In one embodiment, the outer cover 16 includes silicone of 30 Shore A durometer, a biocompatible material, though it is appreciated that other suitable biocompatible and compliant materials can also be employed, including thermoplastic elastomers. Due to its compliant nature, the outer cover 16 provides increased comfort for the patient's body when implanted therein. Additionally, the outer cover 16 is pierceable by a needle to enable sutures to be secured through any number of locations in the outer cover to facilitate ease of securing the port within the patient's body. Furthermore, the compliant outer cover 16 in one embodiment provides a suitable surface for the application of one or more coatings for the part 10. This is true in cases, for instance, where the port body 12 includes titanium or other metal, or an acetyl resin sold under the name DELRIN™, materials where coatings have been traditionally relatively difficult to adhere to. In one example embodiment, an antimicrobial and/or antithrombotic coating(s) can be applied to the surface of the outer cover 16 in order to prevent the growth of microbes and/or formation of thrombus on or around the port 10. Non-limiting examples of coatings that may be applied to the outer cover 16 of the port 10 can be found in the following: U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0003603, filed Aug. 1, 2005, and entitled “Antimicrobial Silver Compositions;” U.S. Application Publication No. 2007/0207335, filed Feb. 8, 2007, and entitled “Methods and Compositions for Metal Nanoparticle Treated Surfaces;” and U.S. Application Publication No. 2007/0293800, filed Apr. 25, 2007, and entitled “Antimicrobial Site Dressings.” Further coating examples can be found in the following: U.S. Pat. No. 6,808,738, entitled “Method of Making Anti-Microbial Polymeric Surfaces;” U.S. Pat. No. 6,475,516, entitled “Drug Delivery via Therapeutic Hydrogels;” and U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/0086568, filed Feb. 26, 2002, and entitled “Method of Making Anti-Microbial Polymeric Surfaces.” Each of the afore-mentioned patents and applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other coatings can also be employed as may be appreciated by one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, an antimicrobial coating applied to the outer cover includes silver and further includes a component to prevent apparent discoloration of the outer cover, such as a dye component commonly known as Brilliant Green, CAS number 633-03-4. In yet another embodiment, an antimicrobial, antithrombotic, or other suitable material can be added to the outer cover materials and configured to elute therefrom at a desired rate in order to provide desired properties to the surface of the outer cover. The outer cover in one embodiment can be colored to fall within a specific color range on the PANTONE® Matching System (Pantone Inc., Carlstadt, N.J.), such as Pantone 3272M and proximate colors, for instance. Note that the body 12 and the retaining ring 26 of the port 10 shown in the present embodiment of FIGS. 1A-2D include titanium. In some embodiments described below, other materials are employed for the port body. It should be remembered that, in addition to what is disclosed herein, other suitable materials can be employed for the various components of the port without departing from the spirit of the embodiments described herein. In accordance with one embodiment, the port 10 further includes a flange 40 that extends radially about a perimeter of the body 12 of the port. As best seen in FIG. 1B, the flange 40 is positioned circumferentially about and proximate to the septum 24 and opening 22 of the fluid cavity 20. So configured, the flange 40 functions as a needle guard for preventing penetration by a needle or other infusion/aspiration device into a portion of the outer cover 16 relatively close to the septum 24 of the port 10. This in turn prevents a user of the needle from penetrating the compliant outer cover 16 and thus believing the needle has accessed the septum 24, which in one embodiment also includes a complaint material such as silicone. In such a case, needle penetration into the outer cover by the user will be impeded by the flange 40, which will indicate to the user the need to re-insert the needle to access the septum 24, thus preventing further problems. It is appreciated that in the present embodiment the flange is formed integrally with the port body and thus includes titanium. In other embodiments, however, the flange can be separately manufactured, can include other suitable materials, can extend from other areas of the port body other than proximate the septum, and can include different shapes and configurations. In one embodiment, the flange 40 also serves to enable identification of the port as including a particular characteristic or attribute. For instance, the flange 40 can include one or more identification features that are observable via x-ray or other similar imaging technology so as to enable identification of a corresponding attribute of the port after implantation thereof into the body of the patient. One example of an attribute that can be indicated by the identification feature is the ability of the port to participate in the infusion of fluids therethrough at a relatively high flow rate, commonly referred to as power injection. Such power injectability is useful, for instance, when injecting contrast media through the port 10 in connection with computed tomography (“CT”) imaging procedures on the patient's body. Power injection flow through the port in one example is performed at a rate of about zero to five milliliters per second, though this can vary according to a number of factors. In accordance with the above, the port flange 40 in one embodiment includes one or more identification features 50, best seen in FIGS. 1C, 1D, and 2D. In particular, the identification features 50 of the present embodiment include alphanumeric indicia 52 that are defined in the body of the flange 40. In greater detail, the flange 40 in the present embodiment includes a set of three alphanumeric indicia 52, wherein each indicium includes the letters “CT” defined through the thickness of the flange so as to provide a radiographic contrast between the CT holes and the surrounding body of the flange when the port is imaged via x-ray. The orientation of the “CT” letters is such that observation thereof in an x-ray will indicate whether the port is properly positioned and oriented within the body of the patient. It is contemplated that the identification features 50 described above can be one or more alphanumeric characters, such as the “CT” depicted in FIGS. 1A-2D. Additionally, the instant disclosure contemplates the use on the flange of other markings, such as one or more symbols, patterns, characters, designs, a combination thereof, etc. The identification feature(s) can be of any size, shape, or both in order to tailor the identification feature for the specific identification of one or more of a variety of attributes of the access port. Specifically, in one embodiment the identification feature(s) can convey information to a practitioner regarding the power-injectability of the implanted port, as has been discussed. Other examples of attributes the identification feature can convey include port type, catheter type, date of manufacture, lot number, part number, etc. In other embodiments, the identification feature can be defined in other ways. In one embodiment, the flange 40 serves yet another function as an anchoring feature in securing engagement between the port body 12 and the outer cover 16. As mentioned above, the alphanumeric indicia (“CT”) 52 in the present embodiment are defined as holes through the thickness of the flange 40, which flange is included with the internal body 12 of the port 10. During manufacture of the port 10, the outer cover 16 of the envelops the port body 12 via an overmolding process, wherein silicone or another suitable, flowable material is injected into a mold containing the port body 12 such that the silicone envelops the majority of the port body, including the flange 40. The silicone is then allowed to cure to form the outer cover 16. During the overmolding process, the flowable silicone flows through the holes of the CT indicia 52 and remains therein after curing is complete such that a bond in and through the CT holes is defined by the silicone, thus anchoring the outer cover 16 as a single piece to the port body 12 and preventing separation therebetween. As will be seen further below, the anchoring features as described here can be modified from what is shown in FIGS. 1A-2D. In one embodiment, an adhesive can be used to adhere the outer cover 16 to the port body 12, especially about the circular termination of the outer cover proximate the port body opening 22. Adhering the outer cover in this area can serve to prevent seepage under the outer cover 16 of any coatings or layers applied to the external surface of the outer cover. Examples of suitable adhesives are available from NuSil Technology LLC of Carpinteria, Calif. As best seen in FIG. 1D, in one embodiment, an insert 56 including the same material as the outer cover 16 is affixed to the bottom surface 14 of the internal port body 12 before overmolding of the outer cover occurs. The purpose of the insert 56 is to help stabilize and secure the internal port body 12 within the mold before the outer cover is overmolded on to the body. In one embodiment, both the outer cover 16 and the insert 56 include silicone such that both integrate together during the overmolding process. In another embodiment shown in FIG. 3F, a disk 70 including a suitable radiopaque material, such as titanium, can replace the insert 56 on the bottom surface 14 of the internal port body 12 and can include an identification feature 50 observable via interaction with x-ray imaging apparatus such that a characteristic or attribute of the port can be identified after implantation. In the illustrated embodiment, the disk includes alphanumeric cutouts of the letters “CT.” FIGS. 3A-3E depict various views of the port 10 according to another embodiment, wherein the internal body 12 of the port includes a thermoplastic, such as an acetyl resin commonly sold under the name DELRIN™. As best seen in FIG. 3B, the port body 12 includes a base 12A and a cap 12B that are mated together via ultrasonic welding or other suitable process to define the fluid cavity 20 and to capture therebetween the septum 24. As such, no retaining ring is employed as in the metallic port of the previous embodiment of FIGS. 1A-2D. The port 10 of FIGS. 3A-3E includes the flange 40 as a separately manufactured component that is attached to the body 12 of the port 10. Specifically, and with additional reference to FIG. 4, the flange 40 of the present embodiment includes a central hole 40A to enable the flange to receive the port body 12 therethrough and to sit atop a ledge defined on the cap 12B, as best seen in FIGS. 3B and 3C. A plurality of notches 60 are defined about the perimeter of the central hole 40A of the flange 40 and correspond with a plurality of extending tabs 62 included on the cap 12B on the ledge thereof. The notches 60 and corresponding tabs 62 are keyed relative to one another so as to enable the flange 40 to seat in only the correct orientation atop the ledge, that is, to ensure the alphanumeric indicia are positioned in the correct orientation with respect to the port. In the present embodiment, after the flange 40 has been properly positioned on the cap 12B during manufacture as shown in FIG. 3C, the notches 60 thereof will be seated over the tabs 62 of the cap. The tabs 62 can then be deformed by a melting, mechanical, or other suitable deformation process so as to lock the flange 40 on the cap 12B and prevent its removal therefrom. As mentioned, FIG. 4 shows further details of the flange 40, including the alphanumeric indicia 52 of each identification feature 50, the central hole 40A, and the notches 60. Note that in the present embodiment, the flange includes titanium and the outer perimeter of the flange 40 generally defines a bulged triangle with a corresponding one of the alphanumeric indicia 52, which indicia serve as both identification features and anchoring features for securing the outer cover 16 to the port body 12, positioned at each of the vertices of the triangle. The “CT” indicia 52 are formed in the flange 40 in one embodiment by wire EDM cutting, though other acceptable methods can also be employed including stamping, molding, etc. It is appreciated that the size, shape, and composition of the flange, together with the configuration of the identification features, can vary from what is shown and described herein. For instance, other suitable materials the flange may include can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 8,029,842, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIGS. 5-9 show details of additional embodiments relating to the flange 40. FIG. 5 shows the flange 40 according to one embodiment, wherein the identification features 50—here represented as the alphanumeric indicia 52—are not defined through the entire thickness of the flange, but are only defined partially therethrough so as to form recessed features. In one embodiment, the indicia 52 are defined to a depth in the flange 40 of about 0.015 inch, the flange including a total thickness of about 0.020 inch, though other depths and flange thicknesses are possible. This enables the “CT” indicia 52 to be viewed visually (before implantation) only when the port 10 is viewed from a top-looking-down perspective, such as the perspective shown in FIGS. 1C and 3D. Further, the CT indicia 52 formed in this manner provide sufficient radiographic contrast to enable the indicia to be imaged via x-ray imaging after port implantation, thus serving the desired role as identification features for the port 10. The indicia 52 can be formed by wire EDM machining, laser etching, etc. In addition, a plurality of through holes 76 is defined through the thickness of the flange 40 to serve as anchoring features for the flange. The flange 40 is positioned similarly to that shown in FIGS. 1A-3E. Note that in the above embodiment and in selected embodiments to follow, the identification features for identifying an attribute of the port are configured such that they are visually viewable (e.g., before implantation) from only predetermined perspectives, such as a top-looking-down perspective shown in FIG. 5 for instance. Such limited perspective visual viewing of the identification feature is useful in one embodiment to indicate to a clinician the top of the port; that is, when the port is placed top-side-up, the identification feature can be visually identified, indicating a proper orientation for inserting the port into the body of the patient. When the port is upside-down, however, the identification feature is not visually observable, thus indicating to the clinician that the port is upside-down. This feature can thus serve to eliminate confusion for the clinician as to the proper orientation of the port. In addition, it is appreciated that in one embodiment, all or a portion of the outer cover of the port can be made opaque so as to eliminate the possibility for a clinician to mistake the CT indicia cutouts of the flange for suture holes through which sutures are to pass. FIGS. 6A-6C show the flange 40 according to another embodiment, wherein the “CT” alphanumeric indicia 52, each serving as the identification feature 50, are defined as cutouts through the thickness of the flange, as in previous embodiments. A compliant, opaque triangular plug 80 defining the letters “CT” in raised relief to correspond with the “CT” of each of the indicia 52 is inserted into the “CT” cutout of each of the indicia so as to be retained thereby. So positioned, the plug enables the “CT” indicia 52 to be viewed visually (before implantation) only when the port 10 is viewed from a top-looking-down perspective, such as the perspective shown in FIGS. 1C and 3D. When visually viewed from the port bottom, the plug prevents the respective indicia 52 from being observed. Instead, the shape of the plug bottom, a triangle in the present embodiment, is seen. Note that the shape of the plug can vary, as can the raised relief on a top surface thereof in order to correspond with the cutout design of the indicia into which the plug is to be inserted. FIG. 7 shows the port 10 according to one embodiment, wherein the outer cover 16 of the port includes a frosted surface 84 or otherwise obscured surface so as to render the outer cover opaque. The frosted surface 16 of the port 10 in one embodiment is achieved during the overmolding phase, wherein the surfaces of the mold used to overmold the outer cover 16 to the internal port body 12 include a roughened surface, achieved for instance via bead blasting of the mold surface. When the outer cover 16 is overmolded in such a mold, the frosted surface 84 of FIG. 7 results. It is appreciated that other suitable methods for providing a frosted or opaque surface to the outer cover 16 can also be employed. In yet another embodiment, only a bottom surface of the outer cover is frosted. In another embodiment, a fabric or mesh structure can be incorporated/imbedded into the outer cover of the port so as to render it opaque. In yet another embodiment, instead of bead blasting, the mold surface can be treated to define thereon diamond-shaped mesh surface features that will impart to the port outer cover when molded therein a roughened, opaque surface. In yet another embodiment, logos or other features can be inscribed into the port outer cover, or included as surface features in the mold surface in which the outer cover is overmolded to the port body so as to render the outer cover at least partially opaque. These and other treatments for outer cover opacity are therefore contemplated. FIG. 8 shows the port 10 according to one embodiment, wherein a colorant or other suitable opaque additive is included with the material that is used to form the outer cover 16, e.g., silicone, so as to render the outer cover opaque. In one embodiment, a colorant such as Kreative Color Purple, K-6050-13, provided by Kreative Liquid Color of Ontario, Calif., is intermixed with the silicone before the overmolding process, resulting in an opaque outer cover 16 for the port 10 after overmolding is complete. Of course, other materials and methods can be employed to render the outer cover opaque. Desired characteristics of the colorant or opaque additive in one embodiment include radiotranslucence, biocompatibility, and compatibility with the material from which the outer cover is made. FIG. 9 shows the port 10 according to another embodiment, wherein in addition to the flange 40, a secondary plate 90 is positioned below the flange as shown in FIG. 9. Like the flange 40, the plate 90 is covered by the outer cover 16 and in one embodiment includes through holes to serve as an anchoring feature for securing the engagement between the outer cover 16 and the internal body 12 of the port 10. Also like the flange 40, the plate 90 can include titanium, bismuth trioxide or other suitable material, or can differ in composition from the flange 40. Positioning of the plate 90 as shown in FIG. 9 limits visual observation of the indicia serving as identification features of the flange 40 to a top-looking-down point of view, as in FIGS. 1C and 3D. FIGS. 10-12 depict various embodiments disclosing additional examples of anchoring features for the internal body 12 of the port 10. The anchoring features to be described operate similar to the “CT” indicia cutouts and other anchoring features of the flange 40 described in the above embodiments in securing the overmolded outer cover to the internal port body. In FIG. 10, anchoring features 130 are included on a flange 140 of the port body 12. The flange 140 is positioned circumferentially about and proximate to the septum 24 included on the port body 12. In particular, the anchoring features are implemented as a plurality of through holes 142 defined through the flange 140. In addition, one or more extensions 146 extend from the port body 12 below the flange 140 a sufficient distance to define additional through holes 148. As has been described relating to this and other embodiments herein including anchoring features, the silicone or other suitable material used to form the outer cover flows about the internal body 12 of the port during the overmolding process, passing through the anchoring features 130 to desirably enhance the adhesion of the outer cover to the port body. FIG. 11 shows another example of an anchoring feature 130 for the port body 12, wherein an annular groove 150 is defined proximate the bottom 14 of the port body 12. A plurality of through holes 152 is defined in the groove so as to extend from the groove to the port body bottom surface 14 to enable flow therethrough of the outer cover material during the overmolding process. FIG. 12 depicts yet another example of anchoring features 130, wherein a plurality of teeth 160 extends from surfaces of the port body 12. In particular, opposing pairs of teeth 160 are shown extending toward one another in FIG. 12, providing a gap not only between opposing teeth, but between the teeth and the adjacent side surface of the port body 12 so as to provide a suitable space through which the outer cover material can flow before solidifying after overmolding to anchor the outer cover to the port body. The size, shape, number, and position of the teeth can vary in a number of ways. More generally, it is appreciated that the preceding embodiments are merely examples of anchoring features and that other types and configurations of anchoring features can reside within the principles of the embodiments of the present invention. FIGS. 13A and 13B depict a port 210 according to one embodiment, wherein a body 212 of the port includes a first body portion 212A defining a nose of the body and a second body portion 212B defining the remaining portion of the body. In the present embodiment, the first body portion 212A includes a relatively rigid biocompatible material, such as acetyl resin or other thermoplastic, while the second body portion 212B includes a compliant overmolded material, such as silicone or other suitable biocompatible material. So configured, the port body nose defined by the first body portion 212A is relatively rigid to assist in placement of the port into a pocket defined in the tissue of the patient, while the remainder portion of the port body 212 defined by the second body portion 212B is compliant to increase patient comfort and to increase suturability of the port 210. Overmolding of the second body portion can be achieved in a manner similar to previous embodiments. FIGS. 14A and 14B depict yet another example of anchoring features 130, wherein a plurality of dovetail extensions 220 extends from the circular side surface of the port body cap 12B about the circumference thereof. The dovetail extensions 220 provide ample surface area and entrapment areas between adjacent dovetails through which the outer cover material can flow before solidifying after overmolding to anchor the outer cover to the port body. The size, shape, number, position, and spacing of the dovetails teeth can vary in a number of ways. For instance, in addition to their inclusion on the port cap, the dovetail extensions could be included on the port base. Also, though shown extending about the entirety of the port cap circumference, in one embodiment the dovetail extensions could be defined only partially thereabout. These and other variations are contemplated. Embodiments of the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative, not restrictive.
