Step 2: 1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]piperidin-4-one
To a solution of piperidin-4-one hydrochloride (11.6 g, 86.3 mmol, 1.10 equiv) in dichloromethane (120 mL) under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen was added triethylamine (12.1 g, 120 mmol, 2.00 equiv)) at 0° C. This was followed by the addition of a solution of 3-chloro-4-fluorobenzoyl chloride [Example 1, Step 1] (15 g, 78.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in DCM (50 mL) dropwise with stirring at 0° C. in 15 min. The reaction solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with water (200 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with dichloromethane (3×200 mL), and the organic layers were combined. The organic layers were washed with water (3×100 mL) and brine (3×100 mL). The mixture was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was applied onto a silica gel column with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:2) to afford 17 g (85%) of 1-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)carbonyl]piperidin-4-one as a white solid.
