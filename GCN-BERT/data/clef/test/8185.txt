Step 2: Preparation of 5-bromo-[1,2,4] triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-amine(3)
Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (35.2 g, 503.1 mmol), diisopropylethylamine(54.1 g, 419.3 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of ethanol(500 mL) and methanol(500 mL). After stirring at 25°C for 1 hour, ethyl-N-[(6-bromo-2-pyridyl)thiocarbamoyl] carbamic acid(51.0 g, 167.7 mmol) was added, and the air inside was replaced with nitrogen. The reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C for the reaction for 3 hours, and then cooled. After the reaction was completed from the TLC monitoring display, the reaction mixture was distilled under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was stirred by using 500 mL of water for 10 min, then filtered. The filter cake was collected and dried to give 5-bromo-[1,2,4] triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-amine(32 g, 85.1% yield) as a white solid.
