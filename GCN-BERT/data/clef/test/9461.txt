Step 2
5-(Chloromethyl)-3-isopropylisoxazole
(3-isopropylisoxazol-5-yl) methanol (150 mg, 1.06 mmol) and triethylamine (322 mg, 3.16 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (5 mL). Methanesulfonyl chloride (237 mg, 2.12 mmol) was added at 0°C. The reaction solution was slowly warmed to 25°C and stirred for 2 hours. The reaction was quenched by the addition of saturated sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution (10 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (10 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined, washed with saturated sodium chloride aqueous solution (30 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 5-(chloromethyl)-3-isopropylisoxazole (72.5 mg, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 43%.
