(tetrahydro-pyran-2-yl)-acetic acid benzyl ester
Benzyl bromide (CAS#100-39-0, 1.07 mL, 9.0 mmol, 1.3 eq) was added to a solution of 2-tetrahydropyran-2-ylacetic acid (1.0 g, 6.93 mmol, 1.0 eq) and triethylamine (1.54 mL, 11.1 mmol, 1.6 eq) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 2 hours and was diluted with a saturated NH4Cl aqueous solution and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (heptane/ethyl acetate 100/0 to 80/20) to deliver the title compound (330 mg, 20%).
