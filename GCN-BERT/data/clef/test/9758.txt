Synthesis of N-ethyl-1,9-dimethylphenothiazine (1,9-DMeEPT)
In an oven-dried 50 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser under a Na atmosphere, 1,9-dimethylphenothiazine (0.542 g, 2.39 mmol) was dissolved in a solution of anhydrous DMF (8 mL) and anhydrous THF (8 mL). Sodium hydride (0.202 g, 60 wt. % in mineral oil, 5.05 mmol) was added at room temperature, and the reaction was stirred for 10 min. Bromoethane (0.90 mL, 12 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, which was then heated to reflux in an oil bath set at 90Â° C. for 12 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and quenched with ice water. The reaction mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. The organic extracts were filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The resulting organic residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using a gradient of 0-10% ethyl acetate in hexanes as eluent to afford 0.142 g (23%) of a white solid. The purified product was further crystallized from aqueous ethanol to afford white crystals.
