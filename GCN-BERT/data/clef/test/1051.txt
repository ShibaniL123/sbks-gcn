(2) Synthesis of Compound Represented by Chemical Formula A-7
Compound 2 (0.30 g, 0.48 mmol), Compound 3 (0.41 g, 1.15 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (0.008 g, 0.04 mmol), and tricyclohexylphosphine (0.02 g, 0.08 mmol) were dissolved in 100 mL of an anhydrous tetrahydrofuran solvent under a nitrogen atmosphere to prepare a mixture. 10 mL of a 20 wt % tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide aqueous solution was added thereto. The obtained mixture was heated for 3 hours under the nitrogen atmosphere. When a reaction was complete, the resultant was extracted with chloroform and distilled water and treated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The obtained resulting material was purified by using chloroform:hexane (a volume ratio of 1:3) as an eluting solvent through a silica gel column to obtain 0.48 g of a white solid (a yield of 54.2%).
