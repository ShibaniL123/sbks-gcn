Step 5: preparation of intermediate trans-6-allyloxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-oxazol-5-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (1f)
To a solution of trans-6-allyloxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-oxazol-5-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (1e) (3.64 g, 9.30 mmol) in THF (45 mL) at 0°C was added tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1 M in THF) (13.9 mL, 13.94 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 h and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (EtOAc 100%) to give trans-6-allyloxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-oxazol-5-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (1f) (1.53 g, 5.52 mmol, 57%).
