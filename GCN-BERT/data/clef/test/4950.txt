Description Novel IR dyes and laser markable articles comprising such IR dyes Field of the Invention [001] This invention relates to infrared dyes, to articles, in particular security documents, comprising such infrared dyes and to laser marking of articles containing these infrared dyes. Background of the Invention [002] Security cards are widely used for various applications such as identification purposes (ID cards) and financial transfers (credit cards). Such cards typically consist of a laminated structure consisting of various paper or plastic laminates and layers wherein some of them may carry alphanumeric data and a picture of the card holder. So called 'smart cards' can also store digital information by including an electronic chip in the card body. A principal objective of such security cards is that they cannot be easily modified or reproduced in such a way that the modification or reproduction is difficult to distinguish from the original. [003] Two techniques frequently used for preparing security documents are laser marking and laser engraving. In literature, laser engraving is often incorrectly used for laser marking. In laser marking, a colour change is observed by local heating of material, while in laser engraving material is removed by laser ablation. [004] Well known in the field of laser markable security documents is the use of laser markable polymeric supports. Laser marking produces a colour change from white to black in a laser markable support through carbonization of the polymer, usually polycarbonate as disclosed in e.g. EP-A 2181858 (AGFA GEVAERT). [005] During the past last years, there is an increased interest of using laser markable layers. The advantage of using a laser markable layer coated on a support instead of a laser markable support, is that a support can be used which has better physical properties than the laser markable supports, such as for example a higher flexibility than a polycarbonate support as disclosed in e.g. EP-A 2567825 (AGFA GEVAERT). [006] There is also an increased interest in using laser marking to produce coloured images in a security document. Therefore, laser markable layers are used which are composed of colour forming compounds (also called " leuco-dyes" ) which can change from essentially colourless or pale- coloured to coloured when exposed to for example heat. Typically such a laser markable layer also contains an IR dye which absorbs the IR radiation and converts it into heat. [007] Multicolour images may be produced by using for example three different laser markable layers in one article, each laser markable layer comprising a leuco-dye generating a different colour and an IR dye having a different maximal IR radiation absorption so that each laser markable layer can be exposed separately. US 4720449 (POLAROID) suggests infrared absorbers that absorb radiation at 760 nm, 820 nm and 1 100 nm, and to use cyanine, merocyanine or thiopyrylium dyes that are substantially non-absorbing in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum so that it will not add any substantial amount of colour to Dmin areas, i.e. the highlight areas of an image. However, no examples of infrared dyes absorbing at 1100 nm are given. [008] In generating multicolour images with infrared lasers, so-called colour contamination or colour fogging may occur when the infrared absorption spectra overlap too much. Less overlap results in a larger achievable colour gamut. US 4720449 (POLAROID) already disclosed that the infrared dyes should have absorption maxima that are at least about 60 nm apart. For a high colour gamut, it would be desirable to have larger gaps than 60 nm possible between the absorption maxima of the infrared dyes. However, there are two problems that limit the options for doing so. [009] A first problem is that dyes below about 830 nm tend to absorb also light in the visual spectrum from 400 to 700 nm, resulting e.g. in a white ID card have an annoying background coloration. [010] A second problem is that, although lasers above 1 100 nm are available, infrared dyes with an absorption maximum above 1100 nm having minor or no absorption in the visual spectrum are not widely available. In the unpublished EP-A 1218814405 (filed on 11-10-2012) infrared dyes are disclosed having an absorption maximum above 1 100 nm. Some infrared dyes disclosed have an absorption maximum above 1150 nm. [0 ] There is still a need for infrared dyes having minor absorption in the visual spectrum and a maximum absorption above 1 100 nm, so that the infrared absorption peaks of the different infrared sensitive recording layers can be spaced well apart in order to realize a multicolour laser markable article having a high colour gamut and minor background coloration. Summary of the Invention [012] It is an object of the invention to provide an infrared dye having minor absorption in the visual spectrum and a maximum absorption above 1 130 nm. This object is realized by the infrared dye as defined by Claim 1. [013] It is a further object of the invention to provide an imaging element, in particular a security document precursors, comprising an infrared dye as defined in claim 1. [014] Further advantages and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following description.

[0100] Besides these typical thermoset polymer systems other crosslinkable systems can be used formed by reaction of reactive polymers or reaction of functional polymers with a crosslinker. [0101] The colour forming layer preferably includes a polymeric binder comprising vinyl acetate and at least 85 wt% of vinyl chloride based on the total weight of the binder. [0 02] In one embodiment, the colour laser markable laminate according to the present invention contains an outer layer including a polymeric binder comprising vinyl acetate and at least 50 wt% of vinyl chloride based on the total weight of the binder. An advantage of the outer layer is that it is suitable as a receiver layer for dyes applied by thermal dye sublimation or even inkjet printing.

[0104] In a preferred embodiment, the polymeric binder includes at least 4 wt% of vinyl acetate based on the total weight of the binder. The advantage of having at least 4 wt% of vinyl acetate in the polymeric binder is that the solubility of the polymeric binder is drastically improved in preferred coating solvents, such as methyl ethyl ketone. [0105] In a more preferred embodiment, the polymeric binder consists of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate. [0106] The polymeric binder is preferably present in the colour forming layer in an amount of 1 to 30 g/m2, more preferably in an amount of 2 to 20 g/m2, most preferably in an amount of 3 to 10 g/m2. Acid Generating Compounds [0107] The fragmentation of a leuco dye in the colour forming layer may be catalyzed or amplified by acids and acid generating agents. [0108] All publicly-known photo- and thermal acid generators can be used for the present invention. They can optionally be combined with a photosensitizing dye. Photo- and thermal acid generators are for example widely used in conventional photoresist material. For more information see for example " Encyclopaedia of polymer science" , 4th edition, Wiley or " Industrial Photoinitiators, A Technical Guide" , CRC Press 2010. [0109] Preferred classes of photo- and thermal acid generators are iodonium salts, sulfonium salts, ferrocenium salts, sulfonyl oximes, halomethyl triazines, halomethylarylsulfone, a-haloacetophenones, sulfonate esters, t-butyl esters, ally! substituted phenols, t-butyl carbonates, sulfate esters, phosphate esters and phosphonate esters.

[0111] A particular preferred acid generating compound is CASNR 953-91 -3. [01 12] The acid generating agent is preferably present in the amount of 10 to 20 wt%, more preferably 14 to 16 wt% based on the total dry weight of the colour forming layer. Acid Scavenger [01 13] The colour forming layer of the security laminate may contains one or more acid scavengers. [01 14] Acid scavengers include organic or inorganic bases. Examples of the inorganic bases include hydroxides of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals; secondary or tertiary phosphates, borates, carbonates; quinolinates and metaborates of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals; a combination of zinc hydroxide or zinc oxide and a chelating agent (e.g., sodium picolinate); hydrotalcite such as Hycite 713 from Clariant; ammonium hydroxide; hydroxides of quaternary alkylammoniums; and hydroxides of other metals. Examples of the organic bases include aliphatic amines (e.g., trialkylamines, hydroxylamines and aliphatic polyamines); aromatic amines (e.g., N-alkyl- substituted aromatic amines, N-hydroxylalkyl-substituted aromatic amines and bis[p-(dialkylamino)phenyl]-methanes), heterocyclic amines, amidines, cyclic amidines, guanidines and cyclic guanidines.

[01 16] Further examples of acid scavengers are salts of weak organic acids such as carboxilates (e.g. calcium stearate). [01 17] A preferred acid scavenger is an organic base, more preferably an amine. [01 18] A particular preferred acid scavenger is an organic base having a pKb of less than 7. UV absorbers [01 19] The laser markable article may also comprise an UV-absorber. The UV- absorber may be present in a laser markable layer or may also be present in another layer, for example, an outer layer. In a preferred embodiment, the UV-absorber is present in an outer layer. [0120] Examples of suitable UV-absorbers include 2-hydroxyphenyl-benzophenones (BP) such as Chimassorb™ 81 and Chimassorb™ 90 from BASF; 2-(2- hydroxyphenyl)-benzotriazoles (BTZ) such as Tinuvin™ 109, Tinuvin™ 1130, Tinuvin™ 171 , Tinuvin™ 326, Tinuvin™ 328, Tinuvin™ 384-2, Tinuvin™ 99- 2, Tinuvin™ 900, Tinuvin™ 928, Tinuvin™ Carboprotect™ Tinuvin™ 360, Tinuvin™ 1 130, Tinuvin™ 327, Tinuvin™ 350, Tinuvin™ 234 from BASF, Mixxim™ BB/100 from FAIRMOUNT, Chiguard 5530 from Chitec; 2-hydroxy- phenyl-s-triazines (HPT) such as Tinuvin™ 460, Tinuvin™ 400, Tinuvin™ 405, Tinuvin™ 477, Tinuvin™ 479, Tinuvin™ 1577 ED, Tinuvin™ 1600 from BASF, 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-s-triazine (CASRN1668-53-7) from Capot Chemical Ltd and 4-[4,6-bis(2-methyl- phenoxy)-1 ,3,5-triazin-2-yl]-1 ,3-benzenediol (CASRN13413-61 -1 ); titanium dioxide such as Solasorb 100F from from Croda Chemicals; zink oxide such as Solasorb 200F from Croda Chemicals; benzoxazines such as Cyasorb UV-3638 F, CYASORB™ UV-1164 from CYTEC; and oxamides such as Sanduvor VSU from Clariant. [0121] Preferred UV absorbers have in the wavelength region between 300 and 400 nm a maximum absorption above 330 nm, more preferably above 350 nm. [0122] Particular preferred UV absorbers are hydroxyphenyl benzotriazoles and 2-hydroxyphenyl-s-triazines having a maximum absorption above 350 nm in the wavelength region 300 - 400 nm. [0123] The UV-absorber may be present in a laser markable layer or may also be present in another layer, for example, an outer layer. In a preferred embodiment, the UV-absorber is present in an outer layer. Transparent Polymeric Supports [0124] The colour laser markable laminate preferably includes a support, more preferably a transparent polymeric support, more preferably a transparent axially stretched polyester support. The colour forming layer is coated directly on the polymeric support or on a subbing layer present on the polymeric support for improving adhesion of the colour forming layer, thereby preventing falsification through delamination. [0125] Suitable transparent polymeric supports include cellulose acetate propionate or cellulose acetate butyrate, polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyimides, polyolefins, polyvinylchlorides, polyvinylacetals, polyethers and polysulphonamides. [0126] In the most preferred embodiment, the transparent polymeric support is a biaxially stretched polyethylene terephthalate foil (PET-C foil) to be very durable and resistant to scratches and chemical substances. [0127] The support preferably is a single component extrudate, but may also be co- extrudate. Examples of suitable co-extrudates are PET/PETG and PET/PC. [0128] Polyester supports and especially polyethylene terephthalate supports are preferred because of their excellent properties of dimensional stability. When polyester is used as the support material, a subbing layer is preferably employed to improve the bonding of layers, foils and/or laminates to the support. [0129] The manufacturing of PET-C foils and supports is well-known in the art of preparing suitable supports for silver halide photographic films. For example, GB 81 1066 (ICI) teaches a process to produce biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate foils and supports. [0130] The polyethylene terephthalate is preferably biaxially stretched with a stretching factor of at least 2.0, more preferably at least 3.0 and most preferably a stretching factor of about 3.5. The temperature used during stretching is preferably about 160°C. [0131] Methods to obtain opaque polyethylene terephthalate and biaxially oriented films thereof of have been disclosed in, e.g. US 2008238086 (AGFA) . Core Supports [0132] The colour laser markable document according to the present invention may include a core support. The core support may be transparent or opaque. The core support is preferably an opaque white core support. The advantage of an opaque white core support is that any information present on the document is more easily readable and that a colour image is more appealing by having a white background. [0133] Preferred opaque white core supports include resin coated paper supports, such as polyethylene coated paper and polypropylene coated paper, and synthetic paper supports such as Synaps™ synthetic paper of Agfa-Gevaert NV. [0134] Other examples of useful high-quality polymeric supports for the present invention include opaque white polyesters and extrusion blends of polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene. Also Teslin™may be used as support. [0135] Instead of a white support, a white opacifying layer can be coated onto a transparent polymeric support, such as those disclosed above. The opacifying layer preferably contains a white pigment with a refractive index greater than 1.60, preferably greater than 2.00, and most preferably greater than 2.60. The white pigments may be employed singly or in combination. Suitable white pigments include C.I. Pigment White 1 , 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 , 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21 , 24, 25, 27, 28 and 32. Preferably titanium dioxide is used as pigment with a refractive index greater than 1.60. Titanium oxide occurs in the crystalline forms of anatase type, rutile type and brookite type. In the present invention the rutile type is preferred because it has a very high refractive index, exhibiting a high covering power. Subbing Layers [0136] The polymeric support may be provided with one or more subbing layers. This has the advantage that the adhesion between the colour forming layer and the polymeric support is improved. [0137] Useful subbing layers for this purpose are well known in the photographic art and include, for example, polymers of vinylidene chloride such as vinylidene chloride/acrylonitrile/acrylic acid terpolymers or vinyiidene chloride/methyl acryiate/itaconic acid terpolymers. [0138] The application of subbing layers is well-known in the art of manufacturing polyester supports for silver halide photographic films. For example, the preparation of such subbing layers is disclosed in US3649336 (AGFA) and GB1441591 (AGFA) ; [0139] Suitable vinyiidene chloride copolymers include: the copolymer of vinyiidene chloride, N-tert.-butylacrylamide, n-butyl acrylate, and N-vinyl pyrrolidone (e.g.70:23:3:4), the copolymer of vinyiidene chloride, N-tert.-butylacrylamide, n-butyl acrylate, and itaconic acid (e.g. 70:21 :5:2), the copolymer of vinyiidene chloride, N-tert.-butylacrylamide, and itaconic acid (e.g. 88:10:2), the copolymer of vinyiidene chloride, n-butylmaleimide, and itaconic acid (e.g. 90:8:2), the copolymer of vinyl chloride, vinyiidene chloride, and methacrylic acid (e.g. 65:30:5), the copolymer of vinyiidene chloride, vinyl chloride, and itaconic acid (e.g. 70:26:4), the copolymer of vinyl chloride, n- butyl acrylate, and itaconic acid (e.g. 66:30:4), the copolymer of vinyiidene chloride, n-butyl acrylate, and itaconic acid (e.g. 80:18:2), the copolymer of vinyiidene chloride, methyl acrylate, and itaconic acid (e.g.90:8:2), the copolymer of vinyl chloride, vinyiidene chloride, N-tert.-butylacrylamide, and itaconic acid (e.g. 50:30:18:2). All the ratios given between brackets in the above-mentioned copolymers are ratios by weight. [0140] In a preferred embodiment, the subbing layer has a dry thickness of no more than 2 pm or preferably no more than 200 mg/m2. Coating Solvents [0141] For coating the colour forming layer and the outer layer, one or more organic solvents may be used. The use of an organic solvent facilitates the dissolution of the polymeric binder and specific ingredients such as the infrared dye. [0142] A preferred organic solvent is methylethylketone (MEK) because it combines a high solubilizing power for a wide range of ingredients and it provides, on coating the colour forming layer, a good compromise between the fast drying of the layer(s) and the danger of fire or explosion thereby allowing high coating speeds. Laser Marking Methods [0143] The method for preparing a colour laser marked document according to the present invention comprises the steps of: a) laminating a colour laser markable article according to the present invention onto a core support; and b) laser marking the colour forming layer by an infrared laser. [0144] A preferred method for preparing a laser marked article uses three infrared lasers L- , L-2 and L-3 having respectively a laser emission wavelength of λ (L-1 ), λ (L-2) and λ (L-3) and comprising the steps of: - laser marking with the infrared laser L-1 a first laser markable layer including an infrared dye IR-1 having an absorption maximum in the infrared region λ max(IR-1 ); - laser marking with the infrared laser L-2 a second laser markable layer including an infrared dye IR-2 having an absorption maximum in the infrared region λ max(IR-2); - laser marking with the infrared laser L-3 a third laser markable layer including an infrared dye IR-3 having an absorption maximum in the infrared region λ max(IR-3), wherein, the laser emission wavelengths satisfy the condition of: λ (L-1) > A (L-2) > A (L-3); the infrared red dye absorption maxima satisfy the condition of: λ max(IR-1) > λ max(IR-2) > λ max(IR-3) ; and wherein IR-1 is an infrared dye according to the present invention as described above. [0145] In a preferred embodiment of the method, the core support is an opaque white core support. In a particular preferred embodiment of the method, the opaque white core support is a PETG support. [0146] In a preferred embodiment of the method, the colour laser marked document is a security document. [0147] In a preferred embodiment of the colour laser marking method, the document is laser marked through a transparent biaxially stretched polyethylene terephthalate foil (PET-C). This PET-C foil is preferably used as support for the colour forming layer. [0148] PET-C foils, such as PETix™ from Agfa-Gevaert NV, are very durable and resistant to mechanical influences (flexion, torsion, scratches), chemical substances, moisture and temperature ranges. This is especially useful for security documents such as identification cards and credit cards for which the average daily usage has augmented substantially from less than 1 time per week to 4 times per day. The card body has to withstand not only this increased usage, but also the associated storage conditions. Cards are no longer safely tucked away in cabinets at home or seldom-opened wallets, but are now loosely put away in pockets, purses, sport bags etc. - ready for immediate use. [0149] PVC (polyvinylchloride) is the most widely used material for plastic cards but has low durability of the card body, resulting in an effective lifetime of only 1- 3 years, much lower than the lifetime of the often expensive chips included in the card. Other materials like Teslin™ and ABS are only suitable for very low- end or single-use cards. PC (polycarbonate) can be used for longer-life and more secure ID cards, but has a high production cost and a low resistance to torsion, scratching and chemicals. Other Security Features [0150] The colour laser markable laminate is preferably combined with one or more other security features to increase the difficulty for falsifying the document. [0151] To prevent forgeries of identification documents, different means of securing are used. One solution consists in superimposing lines or guilloches on an identification picture such as a photograph. In that way, if any material is printed subsequently, the guilloches appear in white on added black background. Other solutions consist in adding security elements such as information printed with ink that reacts to ultraviolet radiation, micro-letters concealed in an image or text etc. [0152] Suitable other security features such as anti-copy patterns, guilloches, endless text, miniprint, microprint, nanoprint, rainbow colouring, 1 D-barcode, 2D-barcode, coloured fibres, fluorescent fibres and planchettes, fluorescent pigments, OVD and DOVID (such as holograms, 2D and 3D holograms, kinegrams™, overprint, relief embossing, perforations, metallic pigments, magnetic material, Metamora colours, microchips, RFID chips, images made with OVi (Optically Variable Ink) such as iridescent and photochromic ink, images made with thermochromic ink, phosphorescent pigments and dyes, watermarks including duotone and multitone watermarks, ghost images and security threads.

After drying, the longitudinally stretched and coated polyethylene terephthalate sheet was transversally stretched to produce a singlewide subbed 63 pm thick sheet PET1 , which was transparent and glossy. [0200] A 1 100 μιη thick polyethylene terephthalate sheet was first longitudinally stretched and then coated on both sides with the coating composition SUB-1 to a wet thickness of 10 pm. After drying, the longitudinally stretched and coated polyethylene terephthalate sheet was transversally stretched to produce a double side subbed 63 pm thick sheet PET2, which was transparent and glossy. Preparation of Laser Markable Inner Laminate IL1 [0201] The coating compositions BCOL1 and YCOL1 were prepared in the same way by mixing the components according to Table 4 using a dissolver.

[0203] Then the coating composition YCOL1 was coated with an Elcometer Bird Film Applicator (from ELCOMETER INSTRUMENTS) on the opposite side of the PET-C support PET2 coated with BCOL1 at a coating thickness of 100 pm and subsequently dried for 2 minutes at 20°C on the film applicator and for a further 15 minutes in an oven at 75°C to deliver the laser markable inner laminate ILL Preparation of Laser Markable Outer Laminate OL1 [0204] The coating composition MCOL1 was prepared by mixing the components according to Table 5 using a dissolves Table 5 [0205] The coating composition MCOL1 was coated with an Elcometer Bird Film Applicator (from ELCOMETER INSTRUMENTS) on the subbed side of the PET-C support PET1 at a coating thickness of 100 μηι and subsequently dried for 2 minutes at 20°C on the film applicator and for a further 15 minutes in an oven at 75°C to deliver the laser markable outer laminate OL1. Preparation of Laser Markable Article LMA1 [0206] An assembly was made of, in order, a white opaque core support CORE, the laser markable inner laminate IL1 , a 35 μιη PETG TR foil, and the laser markable outer laminate OL1 , wherein the side coated with YCOL1 of the laser markable inner laminate IL1 faces the white opaque core support CORE, and wherein the side coated with MCOL1 of the outer laminate OL1 faces the white opaque core support. [0207] The assembly was then laminated into a laser markable article LMA1 using an Oasys™ OLA6/7 plate laminator with the settings: LPT = 130°C, LP = 40, Hold = 210 sec, HPT = 130°C , HP = 40 and ECT = 50°C. Evaluation and Results [0208] The laser markable article LMA1 was then laser marked with three infrared lasers of different emission wavelength. The optical density was measured in reflection using a spectrodensitometer Type GretagMacbeth SPM50 using a visual filter. [0209] A first optically pumped semiconductor laser emitting at 920 nm (Genesis MX 920-4000 MTM from COHERENT) was used for producing a magenta coloured wedge of 0.6 cm x 0.6 cm square boxes of increasing optical density up to a maximum optical density of 2.75 in the laser markable layer coated from MCOL1. The laser was used at a power level of 1.63 W, a dither of 0.025, a scan speed of 100 mm/s and at a pulse repetition rate of 1.2 kHz. [0210] A second optically pumped semiconductor laser emitting at 1064 nm (Genesis MX 1064- 0000 MTM from COHERENT) was used for producing a blue coloured wedge of 0.6 cm x 0.6 cm square boxes of increasing optical density up to a maximum optical density of .32 in the laser markable layer coated from BCOL1 . The laser was used at a power level of 2.82 W (21.8 A), a dither of 0.025, a scan speed of 100 mm/s and at a pulse repetition rate of 1.2 kHz. [0211] A third optically pumped semiconductor laser emitting at 1 150 nm (Genesis MX 1 150-6000 MTM from COHERENT) was used for producing a yellow coloured wedge of 0.6 cm x 0.6 cm square boxes of increasing optical density up to a maximum optical density of 1.35 in the laser markable layer coated from YCOL1. The laser was used at a power level of 4.3 W, a dither of 0.025, a scan speed of 100 mm/s and at a pulse repetition rate of .2 kHz. [0212] No colour contamination was observed in the different coloured wedges. This means that none of the three lasers caused any colour formation in a laser markable layer other than the one for which it was intended. For example, the 920 nm laser caused no blue respectively yellow colour formation in the laser markable layers coated from BCOL1 and YCOL1. [0213] A combination of two different optically pumped semiconductor lasers at different wavelengths (920nm, 1064 nm or 1 150 nm, lasers and exposing parameters as described here above) was used for producing mix colours. Yellow + blue results in green coloured wedges with a maximum density of 1.55. Yellow + magenta results in red coloured wedges with a maximum density of 2.53. 1 -color cards [0214] The colour laser markable articles LMA-2 to LMA-5 were obtained by coating the components as defined in Table 6, dissolved in MEK, onto the subbed site of the PET1 foil described above. The coating solutions were applied at a wet coating thickness of 90 μιη and dried at 50°C for 5 minutes in a circulation oven.

The lamination was performed using a Photonex-325 LSI laminator at a temperature of 130°C and speed mode 1. After lamination, the optical density of the Laser Markable Articles were measured (ODMIN). Then, a test image of 0.6 cm x 0.6 cm was laser marked by a optically pumped semiconductor laser emitting at 1150 nm (Genesis MX 1 150-6000 MTM from COHERENT). The laser was used at a power level of 4.3 W, a dither of 0.025, a scan speed of 100 mm/s and at a pulse repetition rate of 1.2 kHz. The optical density was measured within the laser-marked area (ODLM). ODMIN and ODLM are listed in Table 7.
