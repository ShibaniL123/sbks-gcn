Example 3. Preparation of N-(3-(4-(4-methylpiperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentanamide (LMT-692)
The N-phenyl-N-(3-(4-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide (33.3 mg, 0.072 mmol) obtained in Example 2 and potassium hydroxide (KOH; 9.09 mg, 0.108 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 1 ml), and stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes. Iodomethane (9 Âµl, 0.144 mmol) was added to the mixture, and stirred at the same temperature for 17 hours. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and a residue obtained thereby was diluted with dichloromethane and washed with water and brine. An organic solvent layer was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2:MeOH=20:1), thereby obtaining a final product, N-(3-(4-(4-methylpiperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentaneamide (6 mg, 20% yield).
