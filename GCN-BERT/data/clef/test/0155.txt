ANTIBODIES TARGETING M-CSF This disclosure generally relates to antibodies or antibody fragments which specifically bind to M-CSF. In particular antibodies and antibody fragments are disclosed which bind to M-CSF and which inhibit binding of M-CSF to the M-CSF receptor with an IC50 of 10 ρΜ or less. The invention also relates to nucleic acids, vectors and host cells capable of expressing the antibodies or fragments thereof of the invention, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the antibodies or fragments thereof and uses of said antibodies or fragments thereof and compositions for treatment of specific diseases. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION M-CSF is a secreted cytokine which influences hematopoietic stem cells to differentiate into macrophages or other related cell types. The active form of M-CSF is found extracellularly as a disulfide-linked homodimer. Three different isoforms of M-CSF are found extracellularly: secreted glycosylated M-CSF, secreted proteoglycan M-CSF, and cell-surface M-CSF. M-CSF is a validated target for therapeutic invention, in particularly for the treatment of inflammatory disorders, such as e.g. rheumatoid arthritis. See e.g. US 8,142,777 which is incorporated by reference. Several molecules are under development which target M-CSF, including antibody approaches. See e.g. W02005/030124 (Warner-Lambert/Pfizer) W02005/068503 and (Chiron/Novartis). The present disclosure provides novel antibodies and antibody fragments which are superior to the anti-M-CSF antibodies known from the prior art. In particular, the antibodies and antibody fragments of the present disclosure specifically bind to M-CSF and inhibit the binding of M-CSF to the M-CSF receptor with an IC50 of 10 ρΜ or less in a receptor binding inhibition assay comprising M-CSF at a final concentration of 12.5 ρΜ.

FIGURE LEGENDS FIGURE 1 demonstrates the ability of M-CSF-specific antibodies of the present disclosure to block the bioactivity of membrane-bound M-CSF isoform in an assay in which proliferation of M-NFS-60 cells was induced by CHO cells stably expressing human membrane-bound Μ-CSF. With increasing antibody concentration all M-CSF-specific immunoglobulins efficiently inhibit proliferation. In contrast, MOR03207 which is specific for lysozyme failed to inhibit proliferation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The term "isolated” refers to a compound that is substantially free of other cellular materials and/or chemicals. If such compound is an antibody or antibody fragment then the term “isolated" refers to an antibody or antibody fragment that is also free of other antibodies or antigen binding moieties having different antigenic specificities. The term "antibody" as used herein includes whole antibodies. A naturally occurring "antibody" is a protein comprising at least two heavy (Η) chains and two light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised specific CH domains (e.g. CH1, CH2 and CH3). Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementary determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (C1q) of the classical complement system. The antibodies can be of any isotype (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, lgA1 and lgA2), subclass or modified version thereof (e.g. lgG1 LALA). The antibodies can be of any species, chimeric, humanized or human. The terms “heavy chain variable region CDR1” and “H-CDR1” are used interchangeably, as are the terms “heavy chain variable region CDR2” and “H-CDR2”, the terms “heavy chain variable region CDR3” and “H-CDR3”, the terms “light chain variable region CDR1” and “LCDR1”; the terms “light chain variable region CDR2” and “L-CDR2” and the terms “light chain variable region CDR3” and “L-CDR3”antibody fragment Antigen binding can be performed by “fragments” “antibody fragments” “antigen binding fragments” of an intact antibody. Herein, both terms are used interchangeably. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term "antibody fragment" of an antibody include a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; a F(ab)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; an Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; an Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; a single domain antibody (dAb) fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and an isolated complementary determining region (CDR). A “single chain Fragment (scFv)” is a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see, e.g., Bird et al., (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al., (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:5879-5883). Although the two domains VL and VH are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by an artificial peptide linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain. Such single chain antibodies include one or more antigen binding moieties. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides antibody fragments, wherein said antibody fragment is selected from the group consisting of a Fab, F(ab2)’, F(ab)2’ and scFV. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides antibodies or antibody fragments, wherein said antibody or antibody fragment is bispecific. In certains aspects said antibody or antibody fragment is a bispecific antibody-derived scaffold wherein said bispecific antibody-derived scaffold is selected from the group consisting of a bispecific-scFv, a tetravalent bispecific antibody, a cross-linked Fab or a bispecific IgG. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides to an antibody or antibody fragment, wherein the antibody or antibody fragment is selected from the group consisting of single domain antibodies, maxibodies, minibodies, intrabodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, ν-NAR, camelid antibodies, ankyrins, domain antibodies, lipocalins, small modular immunopharmaceuticals, maxybodies, Protein A and affilins. The terms "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a unique binding site having a unique binding specificity and affinity for particular epitopes. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments which specifically bind to M-CSF. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides polyclonal antibodies or antibody fragments which specifically bind to M-CSF. In certain aspect the disclosure provides an isolated antibody or antibody fragment which is cross-reactive to cynomolgus M-CSF. In certain aspect the disclosure provides an isolated antibody or antibody fragment which is cross-reactive to mouse M-CSF. In certain aspect the disclosure provides an isolated antibody or antibody fragment which is cross-reactive to rat M-CSF. In certain aspect the disclosure provides an isolated antibody or antibody fragment which is cross-reactive to cynomolgus and/or mouse and/or rat M-CSF. The term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from sequences of human origin. As used herein, a human antibody comprises heavy or light chain variable regions or full length heavy or light chains. In certain cases, a human antibody may be at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or at least 95%, or even at least 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene. Thereby said human antibody can be obtained from technology platforms which comprise antibodies derived from human germiine genes either generated by PCR-amplification of VH/VL repertoire isolated from B-cells or are generated synthetically. Technology platforms include library based approaches comprising human immunoglobulin genes displayed on phage, ribosome or yeast. Respective display technologies are standard in the scientific community. Furthermore immunization of a transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin repertoire is another approach to generate human antibodies against an antigen of interest. Antibodies or fragments thereof selected from an antibody library based on the MorphoSys HuCAL® concept (Knappik et al., (2000) J Mol Biol 296:57-86) are considered as fully human. A "humanized" antibody is an antibody that retains the reactivity of a non-human antibody while being less immunogenic in humans. This can be achieved, for instance, by retaining the non-human CDR regions and replacing the remaining parts of the antibody with their human counterparts (i.e., the constant region as well as the framework portions of the variable region). See, e.g., Morrison et al (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855; Morrison and Oi (1988) Adv. Immunol., 44:65-92; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) Science, 239:1534-1536; Padlan, Molec (1991) Immun., 28:489-498; and Padlan, Molec (1994) Immun., 31:169-217. Other examples of human engineering technology include, but are not limited to Xoma technology disclosed in US 5,766,886. The term "chimeric antibody" is an antibody molecule in which (a) the constant region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced or exchanged so that the antigen binding site (variable region) is linked to a constant region of a different or altered class, effector function and/or species, or an entirely different molecule which confers new properties to the chimeric antibody, e.g., an enzyme, toxin, hormone, growth factor, drug, etc.; or (b) the variable region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced or exchanged with a variable region having a different or altered antigen specificity. For example, a mouse antibody can be modified by replacing its constant region with the constant region from a human immunoglobulin. Due to the replacement with a human constant region, the chimeric antibody can retain its specificity in recognizing the antigen while having reduced antigenicity in human as compared to the original mouse antibody. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides human antibodies and antibody fragments which specifically bind to M-CSF. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides humanized antibodies and antibody fragments which specifically bind to M-CSF. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides chimeric antibodies and antibody fragments which specifically bind to M-CSF. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides antibodies comprising a human heavy chain constant region and a human light chain constant region. The term "isotype" refers to the antibody class (e.g., IgM, IgE, IgG such as lgG1 or lgG4) that is provided by the heavy chain constant region genes. Isotype also includes modified versions of one of these classes, where modifications have been made to alter the Fc function, for example, to enhance or reduce effector functions or binding to Fc receptors. For example lgG1 LALA is a modified version of the IgG isotype having significantly reduced effector functions. Specific substitutions of amino acids reduced the binding affinity for Fc gamma Rl receptor as compared with unmodified antibody. lgG1 LALA is described in US serial no. 08/479,752 (SCOTGEN BIOPHARMACEUTICALS INC.) which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In certain embodiments of the present disclosure the antigen-binding moieties of are antibodies and are of the type IgG, IgM, IgA, IGE or IgD. In specific embodiments the antibodies are of the type IgG. In certain embodiments of the present disclosure the antibodies are of the subtype lgG1, lgG2, lgG3 or lgG4. In specific embodiments the antibodies are of the subtype lgG1 or lgG4. In other specific embodiments the antibodies are of the subtype lgG1 or lgG1 LALA. In certain specific embodiments of the present disclosure, the antibodies are of a silent isotype. The term “silent” isotype refers to any immunoglobulin with a diminished effector function. Therefore, in certain embodiments of the present disclosure the antibody is of a lgG1 subtype which has an effector function which is diminished compared to the wild type lgG1 subtype. Certain mutations are particularly suited to achieve a diminished effector function. For example the lgG1 LALA subtype is a typical silent isotype. Other silent versions of the lgG1 isotype might be used with the antibodies of the present disclosure as well. One specifically preferred example is the lgG1 isotype harboring a D265A mutation. In this lgG1 version the amino acid aspartic acid at position 265 (numbering according to the EU index; see http://www.imqt.orq/IMGTScientificChart/Numberinq/Hu IGHGnber.html) is exchanged for an alanine residue. Therefore, in certain aspects the antibodies of the present disclosure are antibodies of a silent lgG1 subtype. In alternative aspect the antibodies of the present disclosure are antibodies of a mutant lgG1 subtype which has decreased effector as compared to the wildtype lgG1 subtype. In alternative aspects the antibodies of the present disclosure are antibodies of the lgG1 subtype carrying a D265A mutation. In alternative aspect the antibodies of the present disclosure are antibodies of the lgG1 subtype wherein the aspartic acid at position 265 is exchanged for an alanine residue. In alternative aspect the antibodies of the present disclosure are antibodies in which the aspartic acid residue at position 265 (numbering according to the EU index) is exchanged for an alanine residue.The subtypes lgG2 and lgG4 are also known as silent isotypes. The term “affinity” as used herein refers to the strength of interaction between an antigen binding moiety, like e.g. a monoclonal antibody and an antigen at single antigenic sites. Within each antigenic site, the variable region of the antibody “arm” interacts through weak non-covalent forces with antigen at numerous sites; the more interactions, the stronger the affinity. The term “specifically binds [to]” an antigen refers to a binding reaction that is determinable in the presence of an antigen in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologies. Thereby the phrases “recognizing an antigen” and “specific for an antigen” are used interchangeably herein with the term “binds specifically to an antigen”. Specific binding of an antigen binding moiety, like e.g. a monoclonal antibody, to an antigen can be determined by various established methods known in the art and include ELISA, FACS, Western Blot, Immuno Blot, MSD, BIAcore and SET. In the present disclosure an antigen binding moiety is deemed to be specific for an antigen if the antigen binding moiety is demonstrated to be able to bind to a specific antigen at least 2-fold, at least 3-fold, at least 4-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 6-fold, at least 7-fold, at least 8-fold, at least 9-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, at least 50-fold, at least 100-fold, at least 500-fold, at least 1000-fold over background. Thereby the background is determined by an antigen binding moiety which is known to be unspecific for the selected antigens or by comparison to binding to an unrelated antigen. The antigen for the inventive antibodies and antibody fragments of the present invention is M-CSF. The full-length human M-CSF precursor (also known as CSF-1 or macrophage colony-stimulating-factor) has a length of 554 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of human Μ-CSF precursor is shown in SEQ ID No.: 1 (source: Uniprot, human M-CSF Ρ09603).

The terms "polypeptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino acid polymer. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular polypeptide sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof. The term "nucleic acid" is used herein interchangeably with the term “polynucleotide” and refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-O-methyl ribonucleotides, peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs). Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, as detailed below, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzeret al. (1991) Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081; Ohtsuka et al. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608; and Rossolini et al. (1994) Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98). In certain aspects the present disclosure provides a nucleic acid encoding an antibody or antibody fragment according to the present disclosure which specifically binds to M-CSF. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides a nucleic acid encoding an antibody or antibody fragment of Table 1. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides a nucleic acid encoding an antibody or antibody fragment of Table 2. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides a vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding an antibody or antibody fragment according to the present disclosure which specifically binds to M-CSF. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides a vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding an antibody or antibody fragment of Table 1. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides a vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding an antibody or antibody fragment of Table 2. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides a host cell comprising a vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding an antibody or antibody fragment of the present disclosure. In certain aspects the present disclosure provides a host cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding an antibody or antibody fragment of the present disclosure. The term “recombinant host cell” (or simply “host cell”) refers to a cell into which a recombinant expression vector has been introduced. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term “host cell” as used herein. The term “vector” refers to a polynucleotide molecule capable of transporting another polynucleotide to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a “plasmid”, which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as “recombinant expression vectors” (or simply, “expression vectors”). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, “plasmid” and “vector” may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, the disclosure is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions.

In certain aspects the present disclosure provides isolated antibodies and antibody fragments which compete with the antibodies specifically disclosed herein for binding to Μ-CSF. In other aspects the present disclosure provides isolated antibodies and antibody fragments which compete with the antibodies specifically disclosed herein for binding to human M-CSF. In other aspects the present disclosure provides isolated antibodies and antibody fragments which compete with the antibodies specifically disclosed herein for binding to a polypeptide encoded by SEQ ID NO.: 1. The term “competes” or “cross-competes” refers to an antibody or antibody fragment which shares the ability to bind to a specific region of an antigen. In the present disclosure an antibody or antibody fragment that is “cross-competitive” has the ability to interfere with the binding of another antibody or antibody fragment for M-CSF in a standard competitive binding assay. Such an antibody may, according to non-limiting theory, bind to the same or a related or nearby (e.g., a structurally similar or spatially proximal) epitope on M-CSF. Cross-competition studies to find antibodies that competitively bind with one another, e.g., the antibodies compete for binding to the antigen can be performed. The ability or extent to which an antibody or antibody fragment is able to interfere with the binding of another antibody or antibody fragment to M-CSF and therefore whether it can be said to crosscompete according to the invention, can be determined using standard competition binding assays. Cross-competition is present if antibody A reduces binding of antibody Β at least by 50%, at least by 60%, specifically at least by 70% and more specifically at least by 80% and vice versa in comparison to the positive control which lacks one of said antibodies. As the skilled artisan appreciates competition may be assessed in different assay set-ups. One suitable assay involves the use of the Biacore technology (e.g. by using the BIAcore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden)), which can measure the extent of interactions using surface plasmon resonance technology. Another assay for measuring cross-competition uses an ELISA-based approach. Furthermore, a high throughput process for “binning” antibodies based upon their cross-competition is described in International Patent Application No. WO2003/48731. Cross-competition is present if the antibody under investigation reduces the binding of one of the antibodies by 60% or more, specifically by 70% or more and more specifically by 80% or more and if one of the antibodies reduces the binding of said antibody to M-CSF by 60% or more, specifically by 70% or more and more specifically by 80% or more. In certain aspect the present disclosure pertains to an antibody or antibody fragment specific for M-CSF, that cross-competes with an antibody described in Table 1. In certain aspect the present disclosure pertains to an antibody or antibody fragment specific for Μ-CSF, that cross-competes with an antibody described in Table 2.

EXAMPLES Example 1: Generation of Fab fragments and antibodies that are specific for M-CSF For the selection of antibodies specifically binding to M-CSF a commercially available phage display library, the MorphoSys HuCAL PLATINUM® library was used. Said antibody library is based on the HuCAL® concept (Knappik et al., (2000) J Mol Biol 296:57-86) and employs the CysDisplay® technology for displaying the Fab on the phage surface (W02001/05950 to Lohning). However, any other available antibody library would be suitable to identify M-CSF antibodies. To identify M-CSF-specific antibodies different panning strategies were used. Each panning strategy comprised at least 3 individual rounds of panning against the receptor-binding domain of human M-CSF (rbdM-CSF), the sequence of which is shown in SEQ ID NO.: 5. The isolated binders identified were maturated, engineered and/or germlined in order to increase affinity and/or functionality of the initial lead molecules. Several hundred binders were screened and rigorously tested for functionality. A subset of 45 candidate molecules were produced in exploratory scale and characterized in the following in vitro assays: • Binding to human and cynomolgus M-CSF in ELISA. • Binding to stably membrane M-CSF-transfected CHO cells and endogenously membrane M-CSF-expressing MDA-MB 231 cells (source: ATCC, order number: ΗΤΒ-26). • Developability risk ranking • Functionality in the receptor inhibition assay (RIA) with human M-CSF. • Functionality in the M-NFS-60 cell (source: ATCC, order number: CTL-1838) viability assay with human M-CSF. In total led eight preferred lead molecules were identified which are further descried herein below. The amino acid and the nucleic acid sequences of the variable regions and the CDRs of those eight binders are shown in Table 1. Table 1: ID# Seq.

The full length antibodies may be used in any immunoglobulin isotype or class. With a few exceptions, the antibodies of the present invention were tested in lgG1 format and in a silenced lgG1 format harboring a D265A mutation in the Fc region. Antibody 8.10.3F was also tested in lgG2 format. Example 3: Specificity for M-CSF as determined in an ELISA assay Specificity for human M-CSF and cynomolgus M-CSF was tested in an ELISA assay. BSA was used as a negative control substrate. Maxisorp™ 384 well plates were coated with human rbdM-CSF, human sgM-CSF, cyno sgM-CSF or mouse sgM-CSF at a concentration of 2 pg/ml in PBS. After blocking of plates with 5% skim milk powder in PBS, Fab-containing Ε. coli lysates, IgG-containing cell culture supernatants or purified IgG or Fab proteins were added. Binding of Fabs or IgGs was detected by F(ab)2 specific goat anti-human IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Dianova Cat# 109-055-097; diluted 1:5000) using Attophos fluorescence substrate (Roche, #11681982001). Fluorescence emission at 535 nm was recorded with excitation at 430 nm. In an alternative experimental set-up, Maxisorp™ 384 well plates were coated with Fd fragment specific sheep anti-human IgG (The Binding Site, #PC075) diluted 1:1000 in PBS. After blocking with 5% skim milk powder in PBS, Fab-containing Ε. coli lysates were added. Subsequently the captured HuCAL®-Fab fragments were allowed to bind to 0.5 pg/ml biotinylated M-CSF (human sgM-CSF, human rbdM-CSF, or mouse sgM-CSF) which was detected by incubation with streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase followed by addition of AttoPhos fluorescence substrate (Roche, #11681982001). Fluorescence emission at 535 nm was recorded with excitation at 430 nm. All antibodies shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3 strongly bound to human M-CSF and cynomolgus M-CSF (>35,000 units), whereas none of the antibodies bound to BSA (<1,000 units). All antibodies are therefore highly specific for M-CSF. Example 4: Specificity for M-CSF as determined in a FACS experiment: EC50s A FACS study was performed in order to test if the antibodies of the present disclosure also binds to M-CSF expressed on cells. Two cell lines were used for this purpose: CHO cells which were stably transfected with M-CSF, and the cell line MDA-MB-231 which endogenously expresses M-CSF. Apparent KD values (EC50) were determined with both cell lines. The results are shown in Table 4. All values are in [ηΜ].

Example 5: Inhibition of receptor binding In this experiment the ability of the antibodies to block binding of human or cynomolgus Μ-CSF to recombinant human M-CSF receptor (provided as Fc fusion protein) was assessed. The following recombinant ligand/receptor-combinations were used: Table 5; Ligand/receptor combinations used in Receptor inhibition assays Human M-CSF Ligand Recombinant human sgM-CSF Receptor Recombinant human CSF1-R-Fc (R&D Systems Cat.Nr. #329-MR) Mouse M-CSF Ligand Recombinant murine sgM-CSF Receptor Recombinant murine M-CSF receptor CSF-1R-Fc (R&D Systems, Cat.Nr.#3818-MR) Cyno M-CSF Ligand Recombinant cynomolgus monkey sgM-CSF Receptor Recombinant human CSF1-R-Fc (R&D Systems Cat.Nr. #329-MR) M-CSF at a final concentration of 12.5 ρΜ (0.66 ng/ml) was preincubated with different concentrations of anti-M-CSF antibody (0.1 ρΜ - 100 ηΜ; all dilutions in ECL-buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Complexes were then transferred to 384 well MSD plates coated with 2 pg/ml of the corresponding receptor. Plates were then washed and incubated with the streptavidin/ECL conjugate for 2 h with shaking at room temperature. 35 μΐ MSD read buffer Τ with surfactant was then added per well and subsequently measured using MSD Sector Imager 6000. IC50 values were calculated for both, human M-CSF and cynomolgus M-CSF. The results are shown in Table 6. All values are in [pM], η=4, except for HeRX1-10G1 in lgG1 format and 8.10.3F in lgG2 format.

This is particularly true for the antibodies which are derived from the parental antibodies Blanche and Laurine, all of which shown IC50 values of below 10 ρΜ. Example 6: Inhibition of proliferation induced by recombinant M-CSF The ability of the antibodies of the present disclosure to block the bioactivity of recombinant M-CSF was assessed in a cell viability assay using the M-CSF-dependent murine myeloid cell line M-NFS-60. Proliferation of this cell line can be induced by human, cynomolgus, rat, and mouse M-CSF. To characterize the anti-M-CSF antibodies, proliferation was induced either by recombinant soluble M-CSF, native soluble M-CSF, or by transfectants expressing cell-surface M-CSF. The following components were tested (Examples 5-7).

In particular, the antibodies which are derived from the parental antibodies Blanche and Laurine are more potent than the prior art antibodies, in particular more potent than 8.10.3F. Example 7: Inhibition of proliferation induced by native M-CSF The ability of the antibodies of the present disclosure to block the bioactivity of native human M-CSF was assessed in an M-NFS-60 cell proliferation assay. Here, proliferation was induced either by human serum or MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium. Antibodies were preincubated for 30min in serum in a 96 well-plate before 1000 M-NFS-60 cells were added. The final serum concentration was 50% and the cell culture medium was not supplemented with FCS. Cell viability was determined as described above after 3 days. Immunoglobulins were titrated and IC50s were calculated. The results are shown in Table 9.

Prior art antibody 8.10.3F was less potent than the other antibodies tested. Similarly, all antibodies inhibited the bioactivity of M-CSF present in human serum. Again, prior art antibody 8.10.3F was less potent than the other immunoglobulins tested. Example 8: Inhibition of proliferation induced by cell surface M-CSF The ability of the antibodies of the present disclosure to block the bioactivity of membrane-bound M-CSF isoforms was assessed in an assay in which proliferation of M-NFS-60 cells was induced by CHO cells stably expressing human cell-surface M-CSF (CHO_hM-CSF cells). 2000 CHO_hM-CSF cells per well were cultured overnight at 37°C in cell-culture 96 well plates, washed twice with PBS and fixed with 100 μΐ 2% glutaraldehyde/PBS per well for 30 min at 37°C. After washing with PBS, fixed cells were incubated with anti-M-CSF antibodies (final IgG concentrations 0.05 ηΜ, 0.5 ηΜ, 5 ηΜ, 50 ηΜ) for 30 min at 37°C. Subsequently, 5000 M-NFS-60 cells per well were added and cultivated for 72 h at 37°C before cell viability was determined as described above. Results are shown in Figure 1. All M-CSF-specific immunoglobulins efficiently inhibited proliferation induced by CHO cells expressing M-CSF. The degree of inhibition increase with an increasing concentration of IgG. Inhibition was almost 100% at the highest IgG concentration tested (50 ηΜ). MOR3207, an antibody with specificity to lysozyme, did not inhibit proliferation. Example 9: Affinity determination The monovalent affinity of the antibodies of the present disclosure was determined by soluble equilibrium titration (Haenel et al. (2005) Anal Biochem 339, 182-4). The antibodies were purified in Fab format and KD to human and cynomolgus M-CSF was determined. The results are shown in Table 10. All values are in [pM], Table 10: Monovalent affinities (KD values) of antibodies as determined by SET Antibody# Human Μ-CSF Cvnomolaus Μ-CSF Blanche 96 130 Caline 14 16 Camille 18 25 Celine n.d. n.d.

As shown in Table 10 all Fabs tested bound to human and cynomolgus M-CSF. Intriguingly, most antibodies demonstrated KD values of 30 ρΜ or lower, i.e. affinities which are higher than those of prior art antibodies HeRX1-10G1 and 8.10.3F, There was no significant difference observed in affinity between human and cynomolgus M-CSF. Example 10: Specificity of the antibodies The specificity of binding of the antibodies of the present invention was exemplary tested with antibody Camille as described in Frese et al. (2013) MAbs, Feb 14;5(2) [Epub ahead of print]. For this specificity profiling test the different proteins and controls were coated on two 384-well MSD plates with a concentration of 1 pg/ml at 4 °C over night. Plates were blocked with BSA and washed three times with PBS with 0.05% (ν/ν) Tween 20. Antibody samples were diluted to 100 ηΜ and 10 ηΜ in assay buffer (PBS with 0.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.05% (ν/ν) Tween 20). As controls, an unspecific antibody (MOR03207; anti-lysozym) and assay buffer were used. Samples and controls were incubated for three hours at room temperature. The plates were washed three times and 30 μΐ detection antibody (ECL-labeled anti-human Fab) were added per well and incubated for 1 h. After washing, MSD Read Buffer Τ with surfactant was added and electrochemiluminescence signals were detected using a Sector Imager 6000 (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). For evaluation, signals of the antibody sample on a certain protein were normalized to the reference antibody MOR03027. Results are shown in Table 11.

Example 11: Comparison of exemplary antibody Camille with the prior art antibodies In the following Table the key features of antibody Camille are compared to the prior art antibodies HeRX1.10G1 and 8.10.3F. Table 12: Comaprison of antibody Camille to the antibodies in the prior art Criterion Camille HeRX1.10G1 8.10.F3 Binding Human M-CSF 18 ρΜ >1,000 ρΜ 38 ρΜ Cynomolgus M-CSF 25 ρΜ n.d. n.d.

This is also reflected in the functional assays, in which Camille performs at least as good as, but in most assays better than, the prior art antibodies HeRX1.10G1 and 8.10.F3. Example 12: Efficacy of the antibodies in a clinical trial A multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, preliminary clinical activity and immunogenicity of multiple doses of the antibodies of the present disclosure administered intravenously to patients with active rheumatoid arthritis will be conducted. Primary outcome measures are the adverse event rate and the safety profile. Secondary outcome measures included DAS28 scores, ACR scores and EULAR28 response criteria. The clinical trial comprises three treatment arms. In each treatment arm patients receive either placebo or the antibodies of the present disclosure (0.3 mg/kg body weight for treatment arm 1, 1.0 mg/kg body weight for treatment arm 2 and 1.5 mg/kg body weight for treatment arm 3). Antibodies and placebo are administered intravenously, weekly with 4 doses in total. Prior to administration the disease activity of all patients is measured according to accepted guidelines by calculating the DAS28 score, a 28-joint Disease Activity Score (see e.g. Ann Rheum Dis (2009) 68, 954-60). DAS28 score is a validated and commonly used tool to quantify the disease status of RA patients. The average DAS28 score is comparable for all treatment arms. The antibodies of the present disclosure show a favorable safety profile among all doses tested and the treatment is safe. 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the first administration of the antibodies or placebo the DAS28 scores of all patients is determined. A decrease in DAS28 scores correlates to diminished disease severity. All patients treated with the antibodies of the present disclosure show a decrease in DAS28 scores, indicating less severity of the disease of effectiveness of the treatment. In contrast, patients treated with placebo showed do not show any benefit from treatment. As another measure of efficacy the ACR20 criteria were used. ACR criteria measure improvement in tender or swollen joint counts and improvement in certain other parameters. The procedure to measure ACR scores is highly standardized. The present clinical trial applied the respective guidelines of the ΕΜΕΑ. In line with the results of the DAS28 scores, also the ACR scores show a strong clinical improvement of patients’ condition upon treatment with the antibodies of the present disclosure. The improvement after 4 weeks is highly significant. 1.
