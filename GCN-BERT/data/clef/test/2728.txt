l HAIR CHARMS This idea relates to beads that can be worn in the hair both as ornamental additions or as .functional aids for hair management or hair extensions. BACKGROUND When wishing to wear ornamental beads in the hair, these beads invariably have to be threaded onto strands and fixed in place in some way. Threading beads onto strands of hair is very delicate and time consuming, often involving either ’wrapping’ the hair, braiding the hair, using some kind of adhesive or using some equipment to facilitate threading heads onto the hair. When wishing to attach hair extensions, there are a variety of methods available but these either require specialist expertise to attach (including braiding, weaving, gluing), specialist products (adhesives) or clips to be fixed into the hair. By using beads (or charms) which are constructed in two parts, held together by strong magnets (a variation to include a bead hinged on one side) and including an internal means of grabbing the hair, they are then very easy to attach and remove without, damaging the hair, yet remain securely attached whilst worn. The ease of attachment and variation, together with no damage to the hair, allows a myriad of opportunities for temporarily adorning the hair; adding length, colour, thickness, decoration and the ability to customise the look. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS According to a first aspect of the present, invention there is provided a hair bead as described in Claim 1. The idea will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings which are for illustrative purposes and axe not drawn fo scale: Figure 1 shows the fundamental internal basis of a bead ~ a cylindrical (tube) bead. Figure 2j shows: a cross section (top view) of a tube bead, indicating; the diameter for the division of the bead. Figure 3 Shows the division of a tube bead into the two halves which form the bead. Figure 4 show's a cross section (top view) of one side of the head illustrating the internal structure of the bead. Figures 5 shows two views of the bead, Sa showing the; front half of the bead (Labelled 3), Indicating placement of magnets for the double edged magnets and Figure 5b showing the variant of the single edged magnets coupled with a hinged edge. Figure 6 ishows a view of the back half of the bead (Labelled. 6), indicating placement of magnets and: the difference to foe front half of foe bead (3), Figure 7 shows a side view of both halves of the bead fixed together, as it would be when worn in the hair. Figure 8a shows an example of the variation of bead width/helghf. ratios and 8h shows the cross section of a large bead, Illustrating the variation. In shape necessary for ftactionaiity. Figure 9 shows an example of the variety of external shapes applicable to the beads. Figure 10 shows different embodiments of the idea, with. Figure 10a showing now the beads can be used for hair extensions, while Figure 10b shows two examples of how the beads can be adapted for decoration. Figure 11 shows different views illustrating the overall effect of wearing hair charms, to enable a belter understanding of the idea in general. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION Figure 1 shows that the primary structure of the bead is a 'tube bead' in that it is basically cylindrical, of variable length and/or circumference. The bead is comprised of a cylindrical tube, halved perpendicular to the diameter (Labelled 1) as shown in Figure 2. This splitting of the cylinder produces two individual halves as Illustrated in Figure 3. Each half of the bead contains flexible hooks (Labelled 2) of varying lengths on the inner surface as shown in the top view cross section: of Figure 4. Both halves of the bead will contain this hooked surface to enable 'grabbing' of the hair between the two halves to avoid slippage, when they are fixed together. There are two variants to connecting the front and back halves of the beads; these being both connecting edges of front and back using magnets (Labelled 4) or one edge connecting using magnets (4) and the other edge being Mnged (Labelled 15). Figure 5a illustrates the front half of the bead (Labelled 3) indicating the location of the strong mini magnets (4) along both of the straight edges of the cylindrical bead (Labelled S). This illustration is for the bead which is connected together by magnets (4) on two edges. The alternative form of fixing the two halves of the beads together is shown In Figure 5b where magnets (4) are attached along one edge (5) of the front half (3) and one edge (Labelled 7} of the back half (Labelled 6) with the other edges being fixed together by means of a hinge (15). Figure 6 shows the back half of the bead (6). Indicating the location of strong mini magnets (4) along the edge of the cylindrical bead <Labelled 7). These magnets (4) are the partners to the magnets (4) along the front half (3) of the bead's edges (5). The edges (7) on the back half of the bead (6) have angled notches (Labelled 8) which act to shorten the edge of the cylindrical bead (7) that is In contact with the matching edges (5) on the front half of the bead (3), enabling a gap (8) with which to prise apart the two halves for removal of the bead from the hair. The notches (8) will be formed by cutting the comers (Labelled 16) off the edges, at a slight angle to the straight edge. Figure 7 illustrates the notch (8) which will become apparent when both front (3) and back (6) halves are connected, The Internal cylindrical structure (Labelled 11) will come in varying diameiers/widths (1) and also varying lengths/heights (Labelled 9) producing different combinations of beads as illustrated in Figure 8a. By varying both the widths (!) and heights (9) of the beads, different, hair types will be accommodated and the beads will remain effective. Beads can then be used across hair types - fine, thick, straight* curly * and also on a variety of amounts of hair captured ■ from large sections using beads for hair management to small sections using beads purely for decoration. The beads which have larger diameters (widths) (1) will need to adjust their cross section to a more elliptical shape as shown, in Figure 8b, rather than circular, to allow the hooks (2) to grip the hair more effectively. Figure 9 illustrates how the internal cylindrical structure (11) of each bead will remain consistent with the details outlined above, although the external shapes of each bead will vary according to materials used and design chosen. A whole variety of materials will be used, including ranges of silver, gold, metals, plastic, foam, wood, modelling materials and glass. The variety of materials used to manufacture the heads and the decorative additions to the beads will allow variations including texture, colour, value and weight. Figure 10a shows how external details can be added to alter the purpose of the beads from decoration to functional. Beads are then a means of allowing temporary hair extensions; offering both bold and natural colours. The hair extensions (10) may comprise natural or synthetic hair strands. The internal structure (11) remains the same, but hair extensions (Labelled 10) are fixed to the outside of the inner tubes and provide a means of attaching hair extensions via magnetic beads. Multiple beads will allow attachment of multiple hair extensions for different effects. These beads will allow the temporary' addition of length, thickness or colour to the wearer's hair. Use of magnetic means of attachment -will negate any damaging materials or treatment to the hair. These beads can he decorative but more appropriately will blend with the hair and remain unobtrusive, as a means of attachment, rather than decoration in the case of hair extensions. Figures 10b illustrates that other decorative features can be added to the beads and hang from them - like spirals encasing the hair (Labelled 12), wires, cords, chains (Labelled 13), gemstones (Labelled 14), fibre optics and LED lights. Figure 11 shows examples of the effects of wearing hair charms to help illustrate the overall impression of this idea. The beads will have a wide ranging design, to enable them to be appropriate across the genders and ages - from children's versions to adult; from male designs to female. 1.
