Detergent Composition Reference to a Sequence Listing This application contains a Sequence Listing in computer readable form, which is incorporated herein by reference. Field of the Invention The present invention concerns a detergent and a pharmaceutical composition comprising a deoxyribonuclease (DNase), wherein the DNase is obtained from a fungal source. It further concerns a laundering method and the use of DNase. The present invention further relates to polypeptides having DNase activity, nucleotides encoding the polypeptide, as well as methods of producing the polypeptides. Background of invention Microorganisms generally live attached to surfaces in many natural, industrial, and medical environments, encapsulated by extracellular substances including biopolymers and macromolecules. The resulting layer of slime encapsulated microorganism is termed a biofilm. Biofilms are the predominant mode of growth of bacteria in the natural environment, and bacteria growing in biofilms exhibit distinct physiological properties. Compared to their planktonically grown counterparts, the bacteria in a biofilm are more resistant to antibiotics, UV irradiation, detergents and the host immune response. A biofilm may include one or more microorganisms, including gram-positive and gram- negative bacteria, algae, protozoa, and/or yeast or filamentous fungi and viruses and/or bacteriophage. Examples of problematic biofilms are dental plaque, infections on medical implants, but also the initial fouling on ship hulls. Biofilms are attributed to the pathogenesis of many infections in humans and are a significant problem in industry in terms of biofouling of exposed surfaces, where biofilm colonisation can form the base component of a localised ecosystem which can disrupt and interfere with industrial processes and components. When laundry items like T-shirts or sportswear are used, they are exposed to bacteria from the body of the user and from the rest of the environment in which they are used. Some of these bacteria are capable of adhering to the laundry item and form a biofilm on the item. The presence of bacteria implies that the laundry items become sticky and therefore soil adheres to the sticky areas. This soil has shown difficult to remove by commercially available detergent compositions. Further, when very dirty laundry items are washed together with less dirty laundry items the dirt present in the wash liquor tend to stick to the biofilm. As a result hereof the laundry item is more "soiled" after wash than before wash. Further, these bacteria are a source of bad odor, which develops after use of the laundry item. The bad odor is difficult to remove and may remain even after wash. The reason for this bad odor is adhesion of bacteria to the textile surface. Because of the adhesion to the textile, the bacteria may remain even after wash, and continue to be a source of bad odor. International patent application WO 201 1/098579 concerns bacterial deoxyribonuclease compounds and methods for biofilm disruption and prevention. Summary of the Invention The present invention concerns a detergent composition comprising a deoxyribonuclease (DNase) and a detergent adjunct ingredient, wherein the DNase is obtained from a fungal source. The invention further concerns a cleaning or laundering method for cleaning or laundering an item comprising the steps of: a. Exposing an item to a wash liquor comprising fungal DNase or a detergent composition comprising fungal DNase; b. Completing at least one wash cycle; and c. Optionally rinsing the item, wherein the item is a textile. In addition is claimed the use of DNase for preventing, reducing or removing the biofilm of an item. The present invention further relates to polypeptides having DNase activity, nucleotides encoding the polypeptide and methods of producing the polypeptide. Definitions Allelic variant: The term "allelic variant" means any of two or more alternative forms of a gene occupying the same chromosomal locus. Allelic variation arises naturally through mutation, and may result in polymorphism within populations. Gene mutations can be silent (no change in the encoded polypeptide) or may encode polypeptides having altered amino acid sequences. An allelic variant of a polypeptide is a polypeptide encoded by an allelic variant of a gene. Biofilm: A biofilm is any group of microorganisms in which cells stick to each other on a surface, such as a textile, dishware or hard surface. These adherent cells are frequently embedded within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Biofilm EPS is a polymeric conglomeration generally composed of extracellular DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides. Biofilms may form on living or non-living surfaces. The microbial cells growing in a biofilm are physiologically distinct from planktonic cells of the same organism, which, by contrast, are single- cells that may float or swim in a liquid medium. Bacteria living in a biofilm usually have significantly different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in various ways. One benefit of this environment is increased resistance to detergents and antibiotics, as the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the interior of the community. On laundry biofilm producing bacteria can be found among the following species: Acinetobacter sp., Aeromicrobium sp., Brevundimonas sp., Microbacterium sp., Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Stenotrophomonas sp. cDNA: The term "cDNA" means a DNA molecule that can be prepared by reverse transcription from a mature, spliced, mRNA molecule obtained from a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell. cDNA lacks intron sequences that may be present in the corresponding genomic DNA. The initial, primary RNA transcript is a precursor to mRNA that is processed through a series of steps, including splicing, before appearing as mature spliced mRNA. Coding sequence: The term "coding sequence" means a polynucleotide, which directly specifies the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. The boundaries of the coding sequence are generally determined by an open reading frame, which begins with a start codon such as ATG, GTG, or TTG and ends with a stop codon such as TAA, TAG, or TGA. The coding sequence may be a genomic DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA, or a combination thereof. Color difference (L value); A Lab color space is a color-opponent space with dimension L for lightness. L value, L* represents the darkest black at L* = 0, and the brightest white at L* = 100. In the context of the present invention L value is also referred to as color difference. Control sequences: The term "control sequences" means nucleic acid sequences necessary for expression of a polynucleotide encoding a mature polypeptide of the present invention. Each control sequence may be native (i.e., from the same gene) or foreign (i.e., from a different gene) to the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide or native or foreign to each other. Such control sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenylation sequence, propeptide sequence, promoter, signal peptide sequence, and transcription terminator. At a minimum, the control sequences include a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences with the coding region of the polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. By the term "deep cleaning" is meant disruption or removal of a biofilm or components of a biofilm such as polysaccharides, proteins, DNA, soil or other components present in the biofilm. Detergent adjunct ingredient: The detergent adjunct ingredient is different to the DNAse of this invention. The precise nature of these additional adjunct components, and levels of incorporation thereof, will depend on the physical form of the composition and the nature of the operation for which it is to be used. Suitable adjunct materials include, but are not limited to the components described below such as surfactants, builders, flocculating aid, chelating agents, dye transfer inhibitors, enzymes, enzyme stabilizers, enzyme inhibitors, catalytic materials, bleach activators, hydrogen peroxide, sources of hydrogen peroxide, preformed peracids, polymeric dispersing agents, clay soil removal/anti-redeposition agents, brighteners, suds suppressors, dyes, perfumes, structure elasticizing agents, fabric softeners, carriers, hydrotropes, builders and co- builders, fabric huing agents, anti-foaming agents, dispersants, processing aids, and/or pigments. Detergent Composition: The term "detergent composition" refers to compositions that find use in the removal of undesired compounds from items to be cleaned, such as textiles. The detergent composition may be used to e.g. clean textiles for both household cleaning and industrial cleaning. The terms encompass any materials/compounds selected for the particular type of cleaning composition desired and the form of the product (e.g., liquid, gel, powder, granulate, paste, or spray compositions) and includes, but is not limited to, detergent compositions (e.g., liquid and/or solid laundry detergents and fine fabric detergents; fabric fresheners; fabric softeners; and textile and laundry pre-spotters/pretreatment). In addition to containing the enzyme of the invention, the detergent formulation may contain one or more additional enzymes (such as proteases, amylases, lipases, cutinases, cellulases, endoglucanases, xyloglucanases, pectinases, pectin lyases, xanthanases, peroxidases, haloperoxygenases, catalases and mannanases, or any mixture thereof), and/or detergent adjunct ingredients such as surfactants, builders, chelators or chelating agents, bleach system or bleach components, polymers, fabric conditioners, foam boosters, suds suppressors, dyes, perfume, tannish inhibitors, optical brighteners, bactericides, fungicides, soil suspending agents, anti-corrosion agents, enzyme inhibitors or stabilizers, enzyme activators, transferase(s), hydrolytic enzymes, oxido reductases, bluing agents and fluorescent dyes, antioxidants, and solubilizers. DNase (deoxyribonuclease): The term "DNase" means a polypeptide with DNase activity that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester linkages in the DNA backbone, thus degrading DNA. For purposes of the present invention, DNase activity is determined according to the procedure described in the Assay I. In one aspect, the polypeptides of the present invention have at least 20%, e.g., at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 100% of the DNase activity of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2.

Enzyme Detergency benefit: The term "enzyme detergency benefit" is defined herein as the advantageous effect an enzyme may add to a detergent compared to the same detergent without the enzyme. Important detergency benefits which can be provided by enzymes are stain removal with no or very little visible soils after washing and/or cleaning, prevention or reduction of redeposition of soils released in the washing process (an effect that also is termed anti- redeposition), restoring fully or partly the whiteness of textiles which originally were white but after repeated use and wash have obtained a greyish or yellowish appearance (an effect that also is termed whitening). Textile care benefits, which are not directly related to catalytic stain removal or prevention of redeposition of soils, are also important for enzyme detergency benefits. Examples of such textile care benefits are prevention or reduction of dye transfer from one fabric to another fabric or another part of the same fabric (an effect that is also termed dye transfer inhibition or anti- backstaining), removal of protruding or broken fibers from a fabric surface to decrease pilling tendencies or remove already existing pills or fuzz (an effect that also is termed anti-pilling), improvement of the fabric-softness, colour clarification of the fabric and removal of particulate soils which are trapped in the fibers of the fabric or garment. Enzymatic bleaching is a further enzyme detergency benefit where the catalytic activity generally is used to catalyze the formation of bleaching components such as hydrogen peroxide or other peroxides. Expression: The term "expression" includes any step involved in the production of a polypeptide including, but not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification, translation, post-translational modification, and secretion. Expression vector: The term "expression vector" means a linear or circular DNA molecule that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide and is operably linked to control sequences that provide for its expression. Fragment: The term "fragment" means a polypeptide having one or more (e.g., several) amino acids absent from the amino and/or carboxyl terminus of a mature polypeptide or domain; wherein the fragment has DNase activity.

Fungal: In the context of the present invention the term "fungal" in relation to polypeptide (such as an enzyme, e.g. a DNAse) refers to a polypeptide encoded by and thus directly derivable from the genome of a fungus, where such fungus has not been genetically modified to encode said polypeptide, e.g. by introducing the encoding sequence in the genome by recombinant DNA technology. In the context of the present invention, the term "fungal DNAse" or "polypeptide having DNAse activity obtained from a fungal source" thus refers to a DNAse encoded by and thus directly derivable from the genome of a fungal species, where the fungal species has not been subjected to a genetic modification introducing recombinant DNA encoding said DNAse. Thus, the nucleotide sequence encoding the fungal polypeptide having DNAse activity is a sequence naturally in the genetic background of a fungal species. The fungal polypeptide having DNAse activity encoding by such sequence may also be referred to a wildtype DNAse (or parent DNAse). In a further aspect, the invention provides provides polypeptides having DNase activity, wherein said polypeptides are substantially homologous to a fungal DNase. In the context of the present invention, the term "substantially homologous" denotes a polypeptide having DNase activity which is at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 96%, 97%, 98%, and most preferably at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of a selected fungal DNase. The polypeptides being substantially homologous to a fungal DNase may be included in the detergent of the present invention and/or be used in the methods of the present invention.

Improved wash performance: The term "improved wash performance" is defined herein as an enzyme displaying an increased wash performance in a detergent composition relative to the wash performance of same detergent composition without the enzyme e.g. by increased stain removal or less redeposition. The term "improved wash performance" includes wash performance in laundry. Isolated: The term "isolated" means a substance in a form or environment that does not occur in nature. Non-limiting examples of isolated substances include (1 ) any non-naturally occurring substance, (2) any substance including, but not limited to, any enzyme, variant, nucleic acid, protein, peptide or cofactor, that is at least partially removed from one or more or all of the naturally occurring constituents with which it is associated in nature; (3) any substance modified by the hand of man relative to that substance found in nature; or (4) any substance modified by increasing the amount of the substance relative to other components with which it is naturally associated (e.g., recombinant production in a host cell; multiple copies of a gene encoding the substance; and use of a stronger promoter than the promoter naturally associated with the gene encoding the substance). An isolated substance may be present in a fermentation broth sample; e.g. a host cell may be genetically modified to express the polypeptide of the invention. The fermentation broth from that host cell will comprise the isolated polypeptide. Laundering: The term "laundering" relates to both household laundering and industrial laundering and means the process of treating textiles with a solution containing a cleaning or detergent composition of the present invention. The laundering process can for example be carried out using e.g. a household or an industrial washing machine or can be carried out by hand. By the term "malodor" is meant an odor which is not desired on clean items. The cleaned item should smell fresh and clean without malodors adhered to the item. One example of malodor is compounds with an unpleasant smell, which may be produced by microorganisms. Another example is unpleasant smells can be sweat or body odor adhered to an item which has been in contact with human or animal. Another example of malodor can be the odor from spices, which sticks to items for example curry or other exotic spices which smells strongly. One way of measuring the ability of an item to adhere malodor is by using Assay II disclosed herein. Mature polypeptide: The term "mature polypeptide" means a polypeptide in its final form following translation and any post-translational modifications, such as N-terminal processing, C-terminal truncation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, etc. In one aspect, the mature polypeptide is amino acids 1 to 206 of SEQ ID NO: 2 and amino acids -37 to -16 of SEQ ID NO: 2 are a signal peptide and amino acids -15 to -1 of SEQ ID NO: 2 are a propeptide. It is known in the art that a host cell may produce a mixture of two of more different mature polypeptides (i.e., with a different C-terminal and/or N-terminal amino acid) expressed by the same polynucleotide. It is also known in the art that different host cells process polypeptides differently, and thus, one host cell expressing a polynucleotide may produce a different mature polypeptide (e.g. , having a different C-terminal and/or N-terminal amino acid) as compared to another host cell expressing the same polynucleotide. In one aspect, a mature polypeptides contains up to 206 amino acid residues and of SEQ I D NO: 2 or SEQ I D NO: 9 (e.g., amino acids 1 to 206 of SEQ ID NO: 2), or up to 204 amino acid residues (e.g., amino acids 3 to 206 of SEQ ID NO: 2).

Nucleic acid construct: The term "nucleic acid construct" means a nucleic acid molecule, either single- or double-stranded, which is isolated from a naturally occurring gene or is modified to contain segments of nucleic acids in a manner that would not otherwise exist in nature or which is synthetic, which comprises one or more control sequences. Operably linked: The term "operably linked" means a configuration in which a control sequence is placed at an appropriate position relative to the coding sequence of a polynucleotide such that the control sequence directs expression of the coding sequence. Pharmaceutical adjunct ingredient means any pharmaceutical excipient suitable for formulating the pharmaceutical compound. Such excipients, carriers, vehicles etc. are well known to those of skill in the art and are described in text books such as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985.

Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. For hard gelatin capsule formulations, the active ingredient can be mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. For soft gelatin capsule formulations the active ingredient can be mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions include suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydropropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally- occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters obtained from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters obtained from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. Aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example benzoates, such as ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavouring agents may be added. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid. Remission value: Wash performance is expressed as a Remission value of the stained swatches. After washing and rinsing the swatches were spread out flat and allowed to air dry at room temperature overnight. All washes swatches are evaluated the day after the wash. Light reflectance evaluations of the swatches were done using a Macbeth Color Eye 7000 reflectance spectrophotometer with very small aperture. The measurements were made without UV in the incident light and remission at 460 nm was extracted.

Whiteness might include one or several issues from the list below: colourant or dye effects; incomplete stain removal (e.g. body soils, sebum etc.); redeposition (greying, yellowing or other discolourations of the object) (removed soils reassociate with other parts of textile, soiled or unsoiled); chemical changes in textile during application; and clarification or brightening of colours. Detailed Description of the Invention The inventors have found that polypeptides having deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity and which are obtained from a fungal source can be used for preventing or removing biofilm on items such as textiles and/or fabric. Biofilm can develop on textile when microorganisms are present on an item and stick together on the item. Some microorganisms tend to adhere to the surface of items such as textiles. Some microorganisms adhere to such surfaces and form a biofilm on the surface. The biofilm may be sticky and the adhered microorganisms and/or the biofilm may be difficult to remove. Furthermore the biofilm adhere soil due to the sticky nature of the biofilm. The commercial laundry detergent compositions available on the marked do not remove such adhered microorganisms or biofilm. The present invention concerns the use of a polypeptide having DNase activity for preventing, reducing or removing a biofilm from an item, wherein the polypeptide having DNase activity is obtained from a fungal source and wherein the item is a textile. In one embodiment of the invention the polypeptide having DNase activity is used for preventing, reducing or removing the stickiness of an item. The polypeptide having DNase activity can further be used for pretreating stains on textile such as textile with a pronounced amount of biofilm adhered to the textile. Additionally, the invention concerns the use of a polypeptide having DNase activity for preventing, reducing or removing redeposition of soil during a wash cycle. When the polypeptide is used for example in the laundering of textile, the polypeptide hinders deposition of soil present in the wash liquor to deposit on the textile. Further, the invention concerns the use of a polypeptide having DNase activity for preventing, reducing or removing the adherence of soil to an item. In one embodiment, the item is textile. When the soil does not adhere to the item, the item appears cleaner. Thus, the invention further concerns the use of a polypeptide having DNase activity for maintaining or improving the whiteness of the item. When items like T-shirts or sportswear are used, they are exposed to bacteria from the body of the user and from the rest of the environment in which they are used. This may cause malodor on the item even after the item is washed. The present invention therefore also concerns removal or reduction of malodor on textile. The malodor may be caused by bacteria producing compounds with an unpleasant smell. One example of such unpleasant smelling compounds is E- 2-nonenal. The malodor can be present on newly washed textile which is still wet. Or the malodor can be present on newly washed textile, which has subsequently been dried. The malodor may also be present on textile, which has been stored for some time after wash. The present invention concerns the reduction or removal of malodor such as E-2-nonenal from wet or dry textile. The present invention further concerns a detergent composition comprising a polypeptide having DNase activity and a detergent adjunct ingredient, wherein the DNase is obtained from a fungal source. The present detergent composition can be used for preventing, reducing or removing biofilm from an item, for preventing, reducing or removing the stickiness of an item, for pretreating stains on the item, for preventing, reducing or removing redeposition of soil during a wash cycle, for reducing or removing adherence of soil to an item, for maintaining or improving the whiteness of an item and for preventing, reducing or removing malodor from an item, such as E-2- nonenal (see Example 10, 13 and 14). The present detergent composition overcomes the problems of the prior art. The inventors have surprisingly found that a polypeptides having DNase activity obtained from fungal source are more stable than bacterial polypeptides having DNase activity when formulated with other detergent enzymes. Especially, the inventors have found that formulating DNase obtained from fungal source in a composition comprising protease the fungal DNase is more stable than the bacterial DNase obtained from bacterial source. The polypeptide having DNase activity can be obtained from Aspergillus, for example from Aspergillus oryzae. The polypeptide having DNase activity obtained from Aspergillus oryzae have shown to be more stable when formulated with protease than the combination of bacterial DNase and protease (see Example 11 and 12). In one embodiment of the invention, the detergent composition comprises the polypeptide having DNase activity as claimed herein. In one embodiment of the invention, the detergent adjunct ingredient is selected from the group consisting of surfactants, builders, flocculating aid, chelating agents, dye transfer inhibitors, enzymes, enzyme stabilizers, enzyme inhibitors, catalytic materials, bleach activators, hydrogen peroxide, sources of hydrogen peroxide, preformed peracids, polymeric dispersing agents, clay soil removal/anti-redeposition agents, brighteners, suds suppressors, dyes, perfumes, structure elasticizing agents, fabric softeners, carriers, hydrotropes, builders and co-builders, fabric hueing agents, anti-foaming agents, dispersants, processing aids, and/or pigments. The detergent adjunct ingredient may be a surfactant. One advantage of including a surfactant in a detergent composition comprising a fungal DNase is that the wash performance is improved. In one embodiment, the detergent adjunct ingredient is a builder or a clay soil removal/anti-redeposition agent. In one embodiment, detergent adjunct ingredient is an enzyme. The detergent composition may comprise one or more enzymes. The one or more enzymes may be selected from the group consisting of proteases, lipases, cutinases, amylases, carbohydrases, cellulases, pectinases, mannanases, arabinases, galactanases, xylanases and oxidases. The inventors have found that DNase obtained from fungal source show good stability when formulated with other enzymes. DNase obtained from bacterial source has shown to have a poor stability when the bacterial DNase is formulated with other enzymes such as proteases. The inventors have found that the DNase obtained from fungal source has increased stability compared to DNase obtained from bacterial source. In one embodiment of the invention, the inventive detergent composition is formulated with a protease, which is of animal, vegetable or microbial origin. The protease is chemically modified or protein engineered. The protease can be a serine protease or a metalloprotease, preferably an alkaline microbial protease or a trypsin-like protease. In one embodiment of the invention, the protease is selected from the group consisting of Bacillus, e.g., subtilisin Novo, subtilisin Carlsberg, subtilisin 309, subtilisin 147, subtilisin 168, trypsin of bovine origin, trypsin of porcine origin and Fusarium protease. The protease can have at least 90%, such as at least 95%, sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 10. In one embodiment, the protease has at least 90% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10 or a variant thereof with substitutions in one or more of the following positions: 27, 36, 57, 76, 87, 97, 101 , 104, 120, 123, 167, 170, 194, 206, 218, 222, 224, 235, and 274, preferably the variant is an alkaline protease having at least 90% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10 with the following substitution: M222S or substitutions N76D+G195E. In one embodiment, the detergent composition is capable of reducing adhesion of bacteria selected from the group consisting of Acinetobacter sp., Aeromicrobium sp., Brevundimonas sp., Microbacterium sp., Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Stenotrophomonas sp. to a surface, or releasing the bacteria from a surface to which they adhere. In one embodiment of the invention, the surface is a textile surface. The textile can be made of cotton, Cotton/Polyester, Polyester, Polyamide, Polyacryl and/or silk. The detergent composition may be formulated as a bar, a homogenous tablet, a tablet having two or more layers, a pouch having one or more compartments, a regular or compact powder, a granule, a paste, a gel, or a regular, compact or concentrated liquid. The detergent composition can be a liquid detergent, a powder detergent or a granule detergent. The invention futher concerns a liquid detergent composition comprising a surfactant and a detergent builder in a total concentration of at least 3% by weight, and a detergent enzyme containing microcapsule, wherein the membrane of the microcapsule is produced by cross-linking of a polybranched polyamine having a molecular weight of more than 1 kDa. The inventors have found, that encapsulating enzymes in a microcapsule with a semipermeable membrane of the invention, and having a water activity inside these capsules (prior to addition to the liquid detergent) higher than in the liquid detergent, the capsules will undergo a (partly) collapse when added to the detergent (water is oozing out), thus leaving a more concentrated and more viscous enzyme containing interior in the capsules. The collapse of the membrane may also result in a reduced permeability. This can be further utilized by addition of stabilizers/polymers, especially ones that are not permeable through the membrane. The collapse and resulting increase in viscosity will reduce/hinder the diffusion of hostile components (e.g., surfactants or sequestrants) into the capsules, and thus increase the storage stability of the enzyme in the liquid detergent. Components in the liquid detergent that are sensitive to the enzyme (e.g., components that act as substrate for the enzyme) are also protected against degradation by the enzyme. During wash the liquid detergent is diluted by water, thus increasing the water activity. Water will now diffuse into the capsules (osmosis). The capsules will swell and the membrane will either become permeable to the enzyme so they can leave the capsules, or simply burst and in this way releasing the enzyme. The concept is very efficient in stabilizing the enzymes against hostile components in liquid detergent, and vice versa also protects enzyme sensitive components in the liquid detergent from enzymes. Examples of detergent components which are sensitive to, and can be degraded by, enzymes include (relevant enzyme in parenthesis): xanthan gum (xanthanase), polymers with ester bonds (lipase), hydrogenated castor oil (lipase), perfume (lipase), methyl ester sulfonate surfactants (lipase), cellulose and cellulose derivatives (e.g. CMC) (cellulase), and dextrin and cyclodextrin (amylase). Also, sensitive detergent ingredients can be encapsulated, and thus stabilized, in the microcapsules of the invention. Sensitive detergent ingredients are prone to degradation during storage. Such detergent ingredients include bleaching compounds, bleach activators, perfumes, polymers, builder, surfactants, etc. Generally, the microcapsules of the invention can be used to separate incompatible components/compounds in detergents. Addition of the microcapsules to detergents can be used to influence the visual appearance of the detergent product, such as an opacifying effect (small microcapsules) or an effect of distinctly visible particles (large microcapsules). The microcapsules may also be colored. The microcapsules can be used to reduce the enzyme dust levels during handling and processing of enzyme products. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages are indicated as percent by weight (% w/w) throughout the application. Microcapsule: The microcapsules are typically produced by forming water droplets into a continuum that is non-miscible with water - i.e., typically by preparing a water-in-oil emulsion - and subsequently formation of the membrane by interfacial polymerization via addition of a cross-linking agent. After eventual curing the capsules can be harvested and further rinsed and formulated by methods known in the art. The capsule formulation is subsequently added to the detergent. The payload, the major membrane constituents and eventual additional component that are to be encapsulated are found in the water phase. In the continuum is found components that stabilize the water droplets towards coalescence (emulsifiers, emulsion stabilizers, surfactants etc.) and the cross linking agent is also added via the continuum. The emulsion can be prepared be any methods known in the art, e.g., by mechanical agitation, dripping processes, membrane emulsification, microfluidics, sonication etc. In some cases simple mixing of the phases automatically will result in an emulsion, often referred to as self- emulsification. Using methods resulting in a narrow size distribution is an advantage. The cross-linking agent(s) is typically subsequently added to the emulsion, either directly or more typically by preparing a solution of the crosslinking agent in a solvent which is soluble in the continuous phase. The emulsion and cross-linking agent or solution hereof can be mixed by conventional methods used in the art, e.g., by simple mixing or by carefully controlling the flows of the emulsion and the cross-linking agent solution through an in-line mixer. In some cases, curing of the capsules is needed to complete the membrane formation. Curing is often simple stirring of the capsules for some time to allow the interfacial polymerization reaction to end. In other cases the membrane formation can be stopped by addition of reaction quencher. The capsules may be post modified, e.g., by reacting components onto the membrane to hinder or reduce flocculation of the particles in the detergent as described in WO 99/01534. The produced capsules can be isolated or concentrated by methods known in the art, e.g., by filtration, centrifugation, distillation or decantation of the capsule dispersion. The resulting capsules can be further formulated, e.g., by addition of surfactants to give the product the desired properties for storage, transport and later handling and addition to the detergent. Other microcapsule formulation agents include rheology modifiers, biocides (e.g., Proxel), acid/base for adjustment of pH (which will also adjust inside the microcapsules), and water for adjustment of water activity. The capsule forming process may include the following steps: - Preparation of the initial water and oil phase(s), - Forming a water-in-oil emulsion, - Membrane formation by interfacial polymerization, - Optional post modification, - Optional isolation and/or formulation, - Addition to detergent. The process can be either a batch process or a continuous or semi-continuous process. A microcapsule according to the invention is a small aqueous sphere with a uniform membrane around it. The material inside the microcapsule is referred to as the core, internal phase, or fill, whereas the membrane is sometimes called a shell, coating, or wall. The microcapsules of the invention have diameters between 0.5 μηι and 2 millimeters. Preferably, the mean diameter of the microcapsules is in the range of 1 μηι to 1000 μηι, more preferably in the range of 5 μηι to 500 μηι, even more preferably in the range of 10 μηι to 500 μηι, even more preferably in the range of 50 μηι to 500 μηι, and most preferably in the range of 50 μηι to 200 μηι. Alternatively, the diameter of the microcapsules is in the range of 0.5 μηι to 30 μηι; or in the range of 1 μηι to 25 μηι. The diameter of the microcapsule is measured in the oil phase after polymerization is complete. The diameter of the capsule may change depending on the water activity of the surrounding chemical environment. Microencapsulation of enzymes, as used in the present invention, may be carried out by interfacial polymerization, wherein the two reactants in a polymerization reaction meet at an interface and react rapidly. The basis of this method is a reaction of a polyamine with an acid derivative, usually an acid halide, acting as a crosslinking agent. The polyamine is preferably substantially water-soluble (when in free base form). Under the right conditions, thin flexible membranes form rapidly at the interface. One way of carrying out the polymerization is to use an aqueous solution of the enzyme and the polyamine, which are emulsified with a non-aqueous solvent (and an emulsifier), and a solution containing the acid derivative is added. An alkaline agent may be present in the enzyme solution to neutralize the acid formed during the reaction. Polymer (polyamide) membranes form instantly at the interface of the emulsion droplets. The polymer membrane of the microcapsule is typically of a cationic nature, and thus bind/complex with compounds of an anionic nature. The diameter of the microcapsules is determined by the size of the emulsion droplets, which is controlled, for example by the stirring rate. Emulsion: An emulsion is a temporary or permanent dispersion of one liquid phase within a second liquid phase. The second liquid is generally referred to as the continuous phase. Surfactants are commonly used to aid in the formation and stabilization of emulsions. Not all surfactants are equally able to stabilize an emulsion. The type and amount of a surfactant needs to be selected for optimum emulsion utility especially with regard to preparation and physical stability of the emulsion, and stability during dilution and further processing. Physical stability refers to maintaining an emulsion in a dispersion form. Processes such as coalescence, aggregation, adsorption to container walls, sedimentation and creaming, are forms of physical instability, and should be avoided. Examples of suitable surfactants are described in WO 97/24177, page 19-21 ; and in WO 99/01534. Emulsions can be further classified as either simple emulsions, wherein the dispersed liquid phase is a simple homogeneous liquid, or a more complex emulsion, wherein the dispersed liquid phase is a heterogeneous combination of liquid or solid phases, such as a double emulsion or a multiple-emulsion. For example, a water-in-oil double emulsion or multiple emulsion may be formed wherein the water phase itself further contains an emulsified oil phase; this type of emulsion may be specified as an oil-in-water-in oil (o/w/o) emulsion. Alternatively, a water-in-oil emulsion may be formed wherein the water phase contains a dispersed solid phase often referred to as a suspension- emulsion. Other more complex emulsions can be described. Because of the inherent difficulty in describing such systems, the term emulsion is used to describe both simple and more complex emulsions without necessarily limiting the form of the emulsion or the type and number of phases present Polyamine: The rigidity/flexibility and permeability of the membrane is mainly influenced by the choice of polyamine. The polyamine according to the invention is a polybranched polyamine. Each branch, preferably ending with a primary amino group serves as a tethering point in the membrane network, thereby giving the favorable properties of the invention. A polybranched polyamine according to the present invention is a polyamine having more than two branching points and more than two reactive amino groups (capable of reacting with the crosslinking agent, i.e., primary and secondary amino groups). The polybranched polyamine is used as starting material when the emulsion is prepared - it is not formed in situ from other starting materials. To obtain the attractive properties of the invention, the polybranched structure of the polyamine must be present as starting material. There is a close relation between number of branching points and number of primary amines, since primary amines will always be positioned at the end of a branch: A linear amine can only contain two primary amines. For each branching point hypothetically introduced in such a linear di-amine will allow one or more primary amine(s) to be introduced at the end of the introduced branch(es). In this context we understand the primary amino group as part of the branch, i.e., the endpoint of the branch. For example, we consider both tris(2-aminoethyl)amine and 1 ,2,3-propanetriamine as molecules having one branching point. For the invention the polyamine has at least four primary amines. Branching points can be introduced from an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain as in the previously stated examples or from unsaturated carbon bonds, such as in, e.g., 3,3'- diaminobenzidine, or from tertiary amino groups, such as in N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2- aminoethyl)ethylenediamine. In addition to the number of branching points, we have found that the compactness of the reactive amino groups is of high importance. A substance such as, e.g., N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(12- aminododecyl)ethylenediamine would not be suitable. Neither would a peptide or protein, such as an enzyme, be suitable for membrane formation. Thus, the polybranched polyamine is not a peptide or protein. In an embodiment, the reactive amino groups constitute at least 15% of the molecular weight of the polybranched polyamine, such as more than 20%, or more than 25%. Preferably, the molecular weight of the polybranched polyamine is at least 1 kDa; more preferably, the molecular weight of the polybranched polyamine is at least 1.3 kDa. In a preferred embodiment, the polybranched polyamine is a polyethyleneimine (PEI), and modifications thereof, having more than two branching points and more than two reactive amino groups; wherein the reactive amino groups constitute at least 15% of the molecular weight of the PEI, such as more than 20%, or more than 25%. Preferably, the molecular weight of the PEI is at least 1 kDa. Combinations of different polybranched polyamines may be used for preparing the microcapsule according to the invention. The advantageous properties (e.g., enzyme storage stability, reduced enzyme leakage, reduced in-flux of detergent ingredients) of the microcapsule of the invention may be improved by adding one or more small amines with a molecular weight of less than 1 kDa. The small amine is preferably substantially water-soluble (when in free base form) and can be a material such as ethylene diamine, hexamethylene diamine, hexane diamine, diethylene tetramine, ethylene tetramine, diamino benzene, piperazine, tetramethylene pentamine or, preferably, diethylene triamine (DETA). The small amines may be added in an amount of up to 50%, preferably up to 40%, up to 30%, up to 20%, up to 10%, or up to 5%, by weight of the total content of small amine and polybranched polyamine, when preparing the microcapsule of the invention. Crosslinking agent: The crosslinking agent as used in the present invention is a molecule with at least two groups/sites capable of reacting with amines to form covalent bonds. The crosslinking agent is preferably oil soluble and can be in the form of an acid anhydride or acid halide, preferably an acid chloride. For example, it can be adipoyl chloride, sebacoyl chloride, dodecanedioc acid chloride, phthaloyl chloride, terephthaloyi chloride, isophthaloyl chloride, or trimesoyi chloride; but preferably, the crosslinking agent is terephthaloyi chloride or trimesoyi chloride.

Optionally rinsing the item, wherein the item is a textile.

In one embodiment the temperature of the wash liquor is 30°C.

One aspect of the present invention relates to a composition comprising or consisting essentially of a polypeptide consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8 and a polypeptide of the present invention consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to an isolated polypeptide having DNase activity encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes under low stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , (ii) the cDNA sequence thereof, or (iii) the full-length complement of (i) or (ii) (Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). In an embodiment, the polypeptide has been isolated. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to an isolated polypeptide having DNase activity encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes under low-medium stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , (ii) the cDNA sequence thereof, or (iii) the full-length complement of (i) or (ii). In an embodiment, the polypeptide has been isolated.

In an embodiment, the polypeptide has been isolated. The polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a subsequence thereof, as well as the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or a fragment thereof or the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 9 or a fragment thereof, may be used to design nucleic acid probes to identify and clone DNA encoding polypeptides having DNase activity from strains of different genera or species according to methods well known in the art. In particular, such probes can be used for hybridization with the genomic DNA or cDNA of a cell of interest, following standard Southern blotting procedures, in order to identify and isolate the corresponding gene therein. Such probes can be considerably shorter than the entire sequence, but should be at least 15, e.g., at least 25, at least 35, or at least 70 nucleotides in length. Preferably, the nucleic acid probe is at least 100 nucleotides in length, e.g., at least 200 nucleotides, at least 300 nucleotides, at least 400 nucleotides, at least 500 nucleotides, at least 600 nucleotides, at least 700 nucleotides, at least 800 nucleotides, or at least 900 nucleotides in length. Both DNA and RNA probes can be used. The probes are typically labeled for detecting the corresponding gene (for example, with 32P, 3H, 35S, biotin, or avidin). Such probes are encompassed by the present invention. A genomic DNA or cDNA library prepared from such other strains may be screened for DNA that hybridizes with the probes described above and encodes a polypeptide having DNase activity. Genomic or other DNA from such other strains may be separated by agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or other separation techniques. DNA from the libraries or the separated DNA may be transferred to and immobilized on nitrocellulose or other suitable carrier material. In order to identify a clone or DNA that hybridizes with SEQ ID NO: 1 or a subsequence thereof, the carrier material is used in a Southern blot. For purposes of the present invention, hybridization indicates that the polynucleotide hybridizes to a labeled nucleic acid probe corresponding to (i) SEQ ID NO: 1 ; (ii) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 ; (iii) the cDNA sequence thereof; (iv) the full-length complement thereof; or (v) a subsequence thereof; under very low, low stringency conditions, low- medium stringency conditions, medium stringency conditions, medium-high stringency conditions, high stringency conditions to very high stringency conditions. Molecules to which the nucleic acid probe hybridizes under these conditions can be detected using, for example, X-ray film or any other detection means known in the art. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to an polypeptide having DNase activity encoded by a polynucleotide having a sequence identity to the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or the cDNA sequence thereof of at least 60%, e.g., at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91 %, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%. In a further embodiment, the polypeptide has been isolated. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to variants of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 comprising a substitution, deletion, and/or insertion at one or more (e.g., several) positions. In an embodiment, the number of amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions introduced into the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 is up to 10, e.g., 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. The amino acid changes may be of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of 1-30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino- terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to 20-25 residues; or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to variants of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 9 comprising a substitution, deletion, and/or insertion at one or more (e.g., several) positions. In an embodiment, the number of amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions introduced into the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 9 is up to 10, e.g., 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. The amino acid changes may be of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of 1-30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino- terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to 20-25 residues; or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain. Examples of conservative substitutions are within the groups of basic amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine), acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine), and small amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine and methionine). Amino acid substitutions that do not generally alter specific activity are known in the art and are described, for example, by H. Neurath and R.L. Hill, 1979, In, The Proteins, Academic Press, New York. Common substitutions are Ala/Ser, Val/lle, Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/Thr, Ser/Asn, Ala/Val, Ser/Gly, Tyr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Asp/Asn, Leu/lle, Leu/Val, Ala/Glu, and Asp/Gly. Alternatively, the amino acid changes are of such a nature that the physico-chemical properties of the polypeptides are altered. For example, amino acid changes may improve the thermal stability of the polypeptide, alter the substrate specificity, change the pH optimum, and the like. Essential amino acids in a polypeptide can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science 244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for DNase activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271 : 4699-4708. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction, or photoaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids. See, for example, de Vos et a/., 1992, Science 255: 306-312; Smith et a/., 1992, J. Mol. Biol. 224: 899-904; Wlodaver et a/., 1992, FEBS Lett. 309: 59-64. The identity of essential amino acids can also be inferred from an alignment with a related polypeptide. Single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988, Science 241 : 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 2152-2156; WO 95/17413; or WO 95/22625. Other methods that can be used include error-prone PCR, phage display (e.g., Lowman et a/., 1991 , Biochemistry 30: 10832-10837; U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; WO 92/06204), and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et al., 1986, Gene 46: 145; Ner ef a/., 1988, DNA 7: 127). Mutagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host cells (Ness et a/., 1999, Nature Biotechnology 17: 893-896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using standard methods in the art. These methods allow the rapid determination of the importance of individual amino acid residues in a polypeptide. The polypeptide may be a hybrid polypeptide in which a region of one polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of a region of another polypeptide. The polypeptide may be a fusion polypeptide or cleavable fusion polypeptide in which another polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the polypeptide of the present invention. A fusion polypeptide is produced by fusing a polynucleotide encoding another polypeptide to a polynucleotide of the present invention. Techniques for producing fusion polypeptides are known in the art, and include ligating the coding sequences encoding the polypeptides so that they are in frame and that expression of the fusion polypeptide is under control of the same promoter(s) and terminator. Fusion polypeptides may also be constructed using intein technology in which fusion polypeptides are created post-translationally (Cooper et a/., 1993, EMBO J. 12: 2575-2583; Dawson et al., 1994, Science 266: 776-779). A fusion polypeptide can further comprise a cleavage site between the two polypeptides. Upon secretion of the fusion protein, the site is cleaved releasing the two polypeptides. Examples of cleavage sites include, but are not limited to, the sites disclosed in Martin et a/., 2003, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 3: 568-576; Svetina et a/., 2000, J. Biotechnol. 76: 245-251 ; Rasmussen- Wilson et a/., 1997, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63: 3488-3493; Ward et a/., 1995, Biotechnology 13: 498-503; and Contreras et al., 1991 , Biotechnology 9: 378-381 ; Eaton et al., 1986, Biochemistry 25: 505-512; Collins-Racie et a/., 1995, Biotechnology 13: 982-987; Carter et a/., 1989, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics 6: 240-248; and Stevens, 2003, Drug Discovery World 4: 35-48. Polynucleotides The present invention also relates to polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide, as described herein. In an embodiment, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of the present invention has been isolated. In another embodiment, the polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention comprises or consists of the polynucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 12. The techniques used to isolate or clone a polynucleotide are known in the art and include isolation from genomic DNA or cDNA, or a combination thereof. The cloning of the polynucleotides from genomic DNA can be effected, e.g., by using the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody screening of expression libraries to detect cloned DNA fragments with shared structural features. See, e.g., Innis et ai, 1990, PCR: A Guide to Methods and Application, Academic Press, New York. Other nucleic acid amplification procedures such as ligase chain reaction (LCR), ligation activated transcription (LAT) and polynucleotide-based amplification (NASBA) may be used. The polynucleotides may be cloned from a strain of Aspergillus, or a related organism and thus, for example, may be an allelic or species variant of the polypeptide encoding region of the polynucleotide. Modification of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be necessary for synthesizing polypeptides substantially similar to the polypeptide. The term "substantially similar" to the polypeptide refers to non-naturally occurring forms of the polypeptide. These polypeptides may differ in some engineered way from the polypeptide isolated from its native source, e.g., variants that differ in specific activity, thermostability, pH optimum, or the like. The variants may be constructed on the basis of the polynucleotide presented as the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or the cDNA sequence thereof, e.g., a subsequence thereof, and/or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions that do not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism intended for production of the enzyme, or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions that may give rise to a different amino acid sequence. For a general description of nucleotide substitution, see e.g., Ford et ai, 1991 , Protein Expression and Purification 2: 95-107. Thus in one embodiment, the polynucleotide comprises or consists of the polynucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 12, wherein the codons have been modified by nucleotide substitutions to correspond to the codon usage of the host organism intended for production of the polypeptide of the present invention. Nucleic Acid Constructs The present invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention operably linked to one or more control sequences that direct the expression of the coding sequence in a suitable host cell under conditions compatible with the control sequences. The polynucleotide may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of the polypeptide. Manipulation of the polynucleotide prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying polynucleotides utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art. The control sequence may be a promoter, a polynucleotide that is recognized by a host cell for expression of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention. The promoter contains transcriptional control sequences that mediate the expression of the polypeptide. The promoter may be any polynucleotide that shows transcriptional activity in the host cell including mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters, and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Examples of suitable promoters for directing transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention in a bacterial host cell are the promoters obtained from the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene (amyQ), Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene (amyL), Bacillus licheniformis penicillinase gene (penP), Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene (amyM), Bacillus subtilis levansucrase gene (sacB), Bacillus subtilis xylA and xylB genes, Bacillus thuringiensis crylllA gene (Agaisse and Lereclus, 1994, Molecular Microbiology 13: 97- 107), E. coli lac operon, E. coli trc promoter (Egon et a/., 1988, Gene 69: 301-315), Streptomyces coelicolor agarase gene (dagA), and prokaryotic beta-lactamase gene (Villa-Kamaroff et a/., 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75: 3727-3731 ), as well as the tac promoter (DeBoer et a/., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80: 21-25). Further promoters are described in "Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria" in Gilbert et a/., 1980, Scientific American 242: 74-94; and in Sambrook et a/., 1989, supra. Examples of tandem promoters are disclosed in WO 99/43835. Examples of suitable promoters for directing transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention in a filamentous fungal host cell are promoters obtained from the genes for Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase, Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase, Aspergillus niger acid stable alpha-amylase, Aspergillus niger or Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase (glaA), Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Aspergillus oryzae alkaline protease, Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase, Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease (WO 96/00787), Fusarium venenatum amyloglucosidase (WO 00/56900), Fusarium venenatum Daria (WO 00/56900), Fusarium venenatum Quinn (WO 00/56900), Rhizomucor miehei lipase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, Trichoderma reesei beta-glucosidase, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase II, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase III, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase V, Trichoderma reesei xylanase I, Trichoderma reesei xylanase II, Trichoderma reesei xylanase III, Trichoderma reesei beta-xylosidase, and Trichoderma reesei translation elongation factor, as well as the NA2-tpi promoter (a modified promoter from an Aspergillus neutral alpha-amylase gene in which the untranslated leader has been replaced by an untranslated leader from an Aspergillus triose phosphate isomerase gene; non-limiting examples include modified promoters from an Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase gene in which the untranslated leader has been replaced by an untranslated leader from an Aspergillus nidulans or Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase gene); and mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters thereof. Other promoters are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,01 1 ,147. In a yeast host, useful promoters are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1 ), Saccharomyces cerevisiae galactokinase (GAL1 ), Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH1 , ADH2/GAP), Saccharomyces cerevisiae triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), Saccharomyces cerevisiae metallothionein (CUP1 ), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, Yeast 8: 423- 488. The control sequence may also be a transcription terminator, which is recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator is operably linked to the 3'-terminus of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide. Any terminator that is functional in the host cell may be used in the present invention. Preferred terminators for bacterial host cells are obtained from the genes for Bacillus clausii alkaline protease (aprH), Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase (amyL), and Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA (rrnB). Preferred terminators for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase, Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase, Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease, Trichoderma reesei beta-glucosidase, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase II, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase III, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase V, Trichoderma reesei xylanase I, Trichoderma reesei xylanase II, Trichoderma reesei xylanase III, Trichoderma reesei beta-xylosidase, and Trichoderma reesei translation elongation factor. Preferred terminators for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome C (CYC1 ), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Other useful terminators for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et ai, 1992, supra. The control sequence may also be an mRNA stabilizer region downstream of a promoter and upstream of the coding sequence of a gene which increases expression of the gene. Examples of suitable mRNA stabilizer regions are obtained from a Bacillus thuringiensis crylllA gene (WO 94/25612) and a Bacillus subtilis SP82 gene (Hue et ai, 1995, Journal of Bacteriology Ml: 3465-3471 ). The control sequence may also be a leader, a nontranslated region of an mRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader is operably linked to the 5'-terminus of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide. Any leader that is functional in the host cell may be used. Preferred leaders for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase and Aspergillus nidulans triose phosphate isomerase. Suitable leaders for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1 ), Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2/GAP). The control sequence may also be a polyadenylation sequence, a sequence operably linked to the 3'-terminus of the polynucleotide and, when transcribed, is recognized by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation sequence that is functional in the host cell may be used. Preferred polyadenylation sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, and Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease. Useful polyadenylation sequences for yeast host cells are described by Guo and Sherman, 1995, Mol. Cellular Biol. 15: 5983-5990. The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that encodes a signal peptide linked to the N-terminus of a polypeptide and directs the polypeptide into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5'-end of the coding sequence of the polynucleotide may inherently contain a signal peptide coding sequence naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding sequence that encodes the polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5'-end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding sequence that is foreign to the coding sequence. A foreign signal peptide coding sequence may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding sequence. Alternatively, a foreign signal peptide coding sequence may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding sequence in order to enhance secretion of the polypeptide. However, any signal peptide coding sequence that directs the expressed polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell may be used. Effective signal peptide coding sequences for bacterial host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for Bacillus NCIB 1 1837 maltogenic amylase, Bacillus licheniformis subtilisin, Bacillus licheniformis beta-lactamase, Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha- amylase, Bacillus stearothermophilus neutral proteases (nprT, nprS, nprM), and Bacillus subtilis prsA. Further signal peptides are described by Simonen and Palva, 1993, Microbiological Reviews 57: 109-137. Effective signal peptide coding sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for Aspergillus niger neutral amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Humicola insolens cellulase, Humicola insolens endoglucanase V, Humicola lanuginosa lipase, and Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase. Useful signal peptides for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor and Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase. Other useful signal peptide coding sequences are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra. The control sequence may also be a propeptide coding sequence that encodes a propeptide positioned at the N-terminus of a polypeptide. The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide (or a zymogen in some cases). A propolypeptide is generally inactive and can be converted to an active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding sequence may be obtained from the genes for Bacillus subtilis alkaline protease (aprE), Bacillus subtilis neutral protease (nprT), Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (WO 95/33836), Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor. Where both signal peptide and propeptide sequences are present, the propeptide sequence is positioned next to the N-terminus of a polypeptide and the signal peptide sequence is positioned next to the N-terminus of the propeptide sequence. It may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences that regulate expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory sequences are those that cause expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory sequences in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the Aspergillus niger glucoamylase promoter, Aspergillus oryzae TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, and Aspergillus oryzae glucoamylase promoter, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I promoter, and Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase II promoter may be used. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those that allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems, these regulatory sequences include the dihydrofolate reductase gene that is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes that are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide would be operably linked to the regulatory sequence. Expression Vectors The present invention also relates to recombinant expression vectors comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention, a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The various nucleotide and control sequences may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector that may include one or more convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide at such sites. Alternatively, the polynucleotide may be expressed by inserting the polynucleotide or a nucleic acid construct comprising the polynucleotide into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression. In one embodiment, the expression vector comprises the polynucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 12 operably linked to the appropriate control sequences for expression. In a further embodiment, polynucleotide sequence codons have been modified by nucleotide substitutions to correspond to the codon usage of the host organism intended for production of the polypeptide of the present invention. The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) that can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about expression of the polynucleotide. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vector may be a linear or closed circular plasmid. The vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one that, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids that together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon, may be used. The vector preferably contains one or more selectable markers that permit easy selection of transformed, transfected, transduced, or the like cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like. Examples of bacterial selectable markers are Bacillus licheniformis or Bacillus subtilis dal genes, or markers that confer antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, spectinomycin, or tetracycline resistance. Suitable markers for yeast host cells include, but are not limited to, ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1 , and URA3. Selectable markers for use in a filamentous fungal host cell include, but are not limited to, adeA (phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase), adeB (phosphoribosyl- aminoimidazole synthase), amdS (acetamidase), argB (ornithine carbamoyltransferase), bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase), hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase), niaD (nitrate reductase), pyrG (orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase), sC (sulfate adenyltransferase), and trpC (anthranilate synthase), as well as equivalents thereof. Preferred for use in an Aspergillus cell are Aspergillus nidulans or Aspergillus oryzae amdS and pyrG genes and a Streptomyces hygroscopicus bar gene. Preferred for use in a Trichoderma cell are adeA, adeB, amdS, hph, and pyrG genes. The selectable marker may be a dual selectable marker system as described in WO 2010/039889. In one aspect, the dual selectable marker is an hph-tk dual selectable marker system. The vector preferably contains an element(s) that permits integration of the vector into the host cell's genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome. For integration into the host cell genome, the vector may rely on the polynucleotide's sequence encoding the polypeptide or any other element of the vector for integration into the genome by homologous or non-homologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector may contain additional polynucleotides for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids, such as 100 to 10,000 base pairs, 400 to 10,000 base pairs, and 800 to 10,000 base pairs, which have a high degree of sequence identity to the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding polynucleotides. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination. For autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question. The origin of replication may be any plasmid replicator mediating autonomous replication that functions in a cell. The term "origin of replication" or "plasmid replicator" means a polynucleotide that enables a plasmid or vector to replicate in vivo. Examples of bacterial origins of replication are the origins of replication of plasmids pBR322, pUC19, pACYC177, and pACYC184 permitting replication in E. coli, and pUB1 10, pE194, pTA1060, and ρΑΜβΙ permitting replication in Bacillus. Examples of origins of replication for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication, ARS1 , ARS4, the combination of ARS1 and CEN3, and the combination of ARS4 and CEN6. Examples of origins of replication useful in a filamentous fungal cell are AMA1 and ANSI (Gems et a/., 1991 , Gene 98: 61-67; Cullen et a/., 1987, Nucleic Acids Res. 15: 9163-9175; WO 00/24883). Isolation of the AMA1 gene and construction of plasmids or vectors comprising the gene can be accomplished according to the methods disclosed in WO 00/24883. More than one copy of a polynucleotide of the present invention may be inserted into a host cell to increase production of a polypeptide. An increase in the copy number of the polynucleotide can be obtained by integrating at least one additional copy of the sequence into the host cell genome or by including an amplifiable selectable marker gene with the polynucleotide where cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene, and thereby additional copies of the polynucleotide, can be selected for by cultivating the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent. The procedures used to ligate the elements described above to construct the recombinant expression vectors of the present invention are well known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et a/., 1989, supra). Host Cells The present invention also relates to recombinant host cells, comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention operably linked to one or more control sequences that direct the production of a polypeptide of the present invention. A construct or vector comprising a polynucleotide is introduced into a host cell so that the construct or vector is maintained as a chromosomal integrant or as a self-replicating extra-chromosomal vector as described earlier. The term "host cell" encompasses any progeny of a parent cell that is not identical to the parent cell due to mutations that occur during replication. The choice of a host cell will to a large extent depend upon the gene encoding the polypeptide and its source. The host cell may be any cell useful in the recombinant production of a polypeptide of the present invention, e.g., a prokaryote or a eukaryote. The prokaryotic host cell may be any Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterium. Gram- positive bacteria include, but are not limited to, Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Geobacillus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Oceanobacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Streptomyces. Gram-negative bacteria include, but are not limited to, Campylobacter, E. coli, Flavobacterium, Fusobacterium, Helicobacter, llyobacter, Neisseria, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, and Ureaplasma. The bacterial host cell may be any Bacillus cell including, but not limited to, Bacillus alkalophilus, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus clausii, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus firmus, Bacillus lautus, Bacillus lentus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus thuringiensis cells. The bacterial host cell may also be any Streptococcus cell including, but not limited to, Streptococcus equisimilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus uberis, and Streptococcus equi subsp. Zooepidemicus cells. The bacterial host cell may also be any Streptomyces cell including, but not limited to, Streptomyces achromogenes, Streptomyces avermitilis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces griseus, and Streptomyces lividans cells. The introduction of DNA into a Bacillus cell may be effected by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Chang and Cohen, 1979, Mol. Gen. Genet. 168: 1 1 1-1 15), competent cell transformation (see, e.g., Young and Spizizen, 1961 , J. Bacteriol. 81 : 823-829, or Dubnau and Davidoff-Abelson, 1971 , J. Mol. Biol. 56: 209-221 ), electroporation (see, e.g., Shigekawa and Dower, 1988, Biotechniques 6: 742-751 ), or conjugation (see, e.g., Koehler and Thorne, 1987, J. Bacteriol. 169: 5271-5278). The introduction of DNA into an E. coli cell may be effected by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Hanahan, 1983, J. Mol. Biol. 166: 557-580) or electroporation (see, e.g., Dower et ai, 1988, Nucleic Acids Res. 16: 6127-6145). The introduction of DNA into a Streptomyces cell may be effected by protoplast transformation, electroporation (see, e.g., Gong et ai, 2004, Folia Microbiol. (Praha) 49: 399-405), conjugation (see, e.g., Mazodier et ai, 1989, J. Bacteriol. 171 : 3583-3585), or transduction (see, e.g., Burke et ai, 2001 , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98: 6289-6294). The introduction of DNA into a Pseudomonas cell may be effected by electroporation (see, e.g., Choi et ai, 2006, J. Microbiol. Methods 64: 391-397) or conjugation (see, e.g., Pinedo and Smets, 2005, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 71 : 51-57). The introduction of DNA into a Streptococcus cell may be effected by natural competence (see, e.g., Perry and Kuramitsu, 1981 , Infect. Immun. 32: 1295-1297), protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Catt and Jollick, 1991 , Microbios 68: 189-207), electroporation (see, e.g., Buckley et ai, 1999, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65: 3800-3804), or conjugation (see, e.g., Clewell, 1981 , Microbiol. Rev. 45: 409-436). However, any method known in the art for introducing DNA into a host cell can be used. The host cell may also be a eukaryote, such as a mammalian, insect, plant, or fungal cell. The host cell may be a fungal cell. "Fungi" as used herein includes the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Zygomycota as well as the Oomycota and all mitosporic fungi (as defined by Hawksworth et al., In, Ainsworth and Bisby's Dictionary of The Fungi, 8th edition, 1995, CAB International, University Press, Cambridge, UK). The fungal host cell may be a yeast cell. "Yeast" as used herein includes ascosporogenous yeast (Endomycetales), basidiosporogenous yeast, and yeast belonging to the Fungi Imperfecti (Blastomycetes). Since the classification of yeast may change in the future, for the purposes of this invention, yeast shall be defined as described in Biology and Activities of Yeast (Skinner, Passmore, and Davenport, editors, Soc. App. Bacteriol. Symposium Series No. 9, 1980). The yeast host cell may be a Candida, Hansenula, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces, or Yarrowia cell, such as a Kluyveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces diastaticus, Saccharomyces douglasii, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Saccharomyces norbensis, Saccharomyces oviformis, or Yarrowia lipolytica cell. The fungal host cell may be a filamentous fungal cell. "Filamentous fungi" include all filamentous forms of the subdivision Eumycota and Oomycota (as defined by Hawksworth et al., 1995, supra). The filamentous fungi are generally characterized by a mycelial wall composed of chitin, cellulose, glucan, chitosan, mannan, and other complex polysaccharides. Vegetative growth is by hyphal elongation and carbon catabolism is obligately aerobic. In contrast, vegetative growth by yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae is by budding of a unicellular thallus and carbon catabolism may be fermentative. The filamentous fungal host cell may be an Acremonium, Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Bjerkandera, Ceriporiopsis, Chrysosporium, Coprinus, Coriolus, Cryptococcus, Filibasidium, Fusarium, Humicola, Magnaporthe, Mucor, Myceliophthora, Neocallimastix, Neurospora, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Phanerochaete, Phlebia, Piromyces, Pleurotus, Schizophyllum, Talaromyces, Thermoascus, Thielavia, Tolypocladium, Trametes, or Trichoderma cell. For example, the filamentous fungal host cell may be an Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus foetidus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus japonicus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Bjerkandera adusta, Ceriporiopsis aneirina, Ceriporiopsis caregiea, Ceriporiopsis gilvescens, Ceriporiopsis pannocinta, Ceriporiopsis rivulosa, Ceriporiopsis subrufa, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, Chrysosporium inops, Chrysosporium keratinophilum, Chrysosporium lucknowense, Chrysosporium merdarium, Chrysosporium pannicola, Chrysosporium queenslandicum, Chrysosporium tropicum, Chrysosporium zonatum, Coprinus cinereus, Coriolus hirsutus, Fusarium bactridioides, Fusarium cerealis, Fusarium crookwellense, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium graminum, Fusarium heterosporum, Fusarium negundi, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium reticulatum, Fusarium roseum, Fusarium sambucinum, Fusarium sarcochroum, Fusarium sporotrichioides, Fusarium sulphureum, Fusarium torulosum, Fusarium trichothecioides, Fusarium venenatum, Humicola insolens, Humicola lanuginosa, Mucor miehei, Myceliophthora thermophila, Neurospora crassa, Penicillium purpurogenum, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Phlebia radiata, Pleurotus eryngii, Thielavia terrestris, Trametes villosa, Trametes versicolor, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, Trichoderma reesei, or Trichoderma viride cell. Fungal cells may be transformed by a process involving protoplast formation, transformation of the protoplasts, and regeneration of the cell wall in a manner known per se. Suitable procedures for transformation of Aspergillus and Trichoderma host cells are described in EP 238023, Yelton et a/., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 : 1470-1474, and Christensen et a/., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422. Suitable methods for transforming Fusarium species are described by Malardier et a/., 1989, Gene 78: 147-156, and WO 96/00787. Yeast may be transformed using the procedures described by Becker and Guarente, In Abelson, J.N. and Simon, M.I., editors, Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology, Methods in Enzymology, Volume 194, pp 182-187, Academic Press, Inc., New York; Ito et a/., 1983, J. Bacteriol. 153: 163; and Hinnen et ai, 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75: 1920. Methods of Production The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising (a) cultivating a cell, which in its wild-type form produces the polypeptide, under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and optionally, (b) recovering the polypeptide. In one aspect, the cell is a Aspergillus cell. In another aspect, the cell is a Aspergillus oryzae cell. The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell of the present invention under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and optionally, (b) recovering the polypeptide. The host cells are cultivated in a nutrient medium suitable for production of the polypeptide using methods known in the art. For example, the cells may be cultivated by shake flask cultivation, or small-scale or large-scale fermentation (including continuous, batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations) in laboratory or industrial fermentors in a suitable medium and under conditions allowing the polypeptide to be expressed and/or isolated. The cultivation takes place in a suitable nutrient medium comprising carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published compositions (e.g., in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). If the polypeptide is secreted into the nutrient medium, the polypeptide can be recovered directly from the medium. If the polypeptide is not secreted, it can be recovered from cell lysates. The polypeptide may be detected using methods known in the art that are specific for the polypeptides. These detection methods include, but are not limited to, use of specific antibodies, formation of an enzyme product, or disappearance of an enzyme substrate. For example, an enzyme assay may be used to determine the activity of the polypeptide. The polypeptide may be recovered using methods known in the art. For example, the polypeptide may be recovered from the nutrient medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, collection, centrifugation, filtration, extraction, spray-drying, evaporation, or precipitation. In one aspect, a fermentation broth comprising the polypeptide is recovered. The polypeptide may be purified by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobic, chromatofocusing, and size exclusion), electrophoretic procedures (e.g., preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (e.g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), SDS-PAGE, or extraction (see, e.g., Protein Purification, Janson and Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989) to obtain substantially pure polypeptides.

In one embodiment, the method further comprises recovering the second polypeptide of interest. Fermentation Broth Formulations or Cell Compositions The present invention also relates to a fermentation broth formulation or a cell composition comprising a polypeptide of the present invention. The fermentation broth product further comprises additional ingredients used in the fermentation process, such as, for example, cells (including, the host cells containing the gene encoding the polypeptide of the present invention which are used to produce the polypeptide of interest), cell debris, biomass, fermentation media and/or fermentation products. In some embodiments, the composition is a cell-killed whole broth containing organic acid(s), killed cells and/or cell debris, and culture medium. The term "fermentation broth" as used herein refers to a preparation produced by cellular fermentation that undergoes no or minimal recovery and/or purification. For example, fermentation broths are produced when microbial cultures are grown to saturation, incubated under carbon- limiting conditions to allow protein synthesis (e.g., expression of enzymes by host cells) and secretion into cell culture medium. The fermentation broth can contain unfractionated or fractionated contents of the fermentation materials derived at the end of the fermentation. Typically, the fermentation broth is unfractionated and comprises the spent culture medium and cell debris present after the microbial cells (e.g., filamentous fungal cells) are removed, e.g., by centrifugation. In some embodiments, the fermentation broth contains spent cell culture medium, extracellular enzymes, and viable and/or nonviable microbial cells. In an embodiment, the fermentation broth formulation and cell compositions comprise a first organic acid component comprising at least one 1 -5 carbon organic acid and/or a salt thereof and a second organic acid component comprising at least one 6 or more carbon organic acid and/or a salt thereof. In a specific embodiment, the first organic acid component is acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, a salt thereof, or a mixture of two or more of the foregoing and the second organic acid component is benzoic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, 4-methylvaleric acid, phenylacetic acid, a salt thereof, or a mixture of two or more of the foregoing. In one aspect, the composition contains an organic acid(s), and optionally further contains killed cells and/or cell debris. In one embodiment, the killed cells and/or cell debris are removed from a cell-killed whole broth to provide a composition that is free of these components. The fermentation broth formulations or cell compositions may further comprise a preservative and/or anti-microbial (e.g., bacteriostatic) agent, including, but not limited to, sorbitol, sodium chloride, potassium sorbate, and others known in the art. The cell-killed whole broth or composition may contain the unfractionated contents of the fermentation materials derived at the end of the fermentation. Typically, the cell-killed whole broth or composition contains the spent culture medium and cell debris present after the microbial cells (e.g., filamentous fungal cells) are grown to saturation, incubated under carbon-limiting conditions to allow protein synthesis. In some embodiments, the cell-killed whole broth or composition contains the spent cell culture medium, extracellular enzymes, and killed filamentous fungal cells. In some embodiments, the microbial cells present in the cell-killed whole broth or composition can be permeabilized and/or lysed using methods known in the art. A whole broth or cell composition as described herein is typically a liquid, but may contain insoluble components, such as killed cells, cell debris, culture media components, and/or insoluble enzyme(s). In some embodiments, insoluble components may be removed to provide a clarified liquid composition. The whole broth formulations and cell compositions of the present invention may be produced by a method described in WO 90/15861 or WO 2010/096673.

The present invention also relates to methods of producing a protein, comprising (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell comprising such polynucleotide; and (b) recovering the protein. The protein may be native or heterologous to a host cell. The term "protein" is not meant herein to refer to a specific length of the encoded product and, therefore, encompasses peptides, oligopeptides, and polypeptides. The term "protein" also encompasses two or more polypeptides combined to form the encoded product. The proteins also include hybrid polypeptides and fused polypeptides. Preferably, the protein is a hormone, enzyme, receptor or portion thereof, antibody or portion thereof, or reporter.

In another embodiment, the present invention relates to an isolated polypeptide having DNase activity encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes under high stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , (ii) the cDNA sequence thereof, or (iii) the full-length complement of (i) or (ii). In an embodiment, the polypeptide has been isolated. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to an isolated polypeptide having DNase activity encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes under very high stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , (ii) the cDNA sequence thereof, or (iii) the full-length complement of (i) or (ii). In an embodiment, the polypeptide has been isolated. The polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a subsequence thereof, as well as the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or a fragment thereof or the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 9 or a fragment thereof, may be used to design nucleic acid probes to identify and clone DNA encoding polypeptides having DNase activity from strains of different genera or species according to methods well known in the art. In particular, such probes can be used for hybridization with the genomic DNA or cDNA of a cell of interest, following standard Southern blotting procedures, in order to identify and isolate the corresponding gene therein. Such probes can be considerably shorter than the entire sequence, but should be at least 15, e.g., at least 25, at least 35, or at least 70 nucleotides in length. Preferably, the nucleic acid probe is at least 100 nucleotides in length, e.g., at least 200 nucleotides, at least 300 nucleotides, at least 400 nucleotides, at least 500 nucleotides, at least 600 nucleotides, at least 700 nucleotides, at least 800 nucleotides, or at least 900 nucleotides in length. Both DNA and RNA probes can be used. The probes are typically labeled for detecting the corresponding gene (for example, with 32P, 3H, 35S, biotin, or avidin). Such probes are encompassed by the present invention. A genomic DNA or cDNA library prepared from such other strains may be screened for DNA that hybridizes with the probes described above and encodes a polypeptide having DNase activity. Genomic or other DNA from such other strains may be separated by agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or other separation techniques. DNA from the libraries or the separated DNA may be transferred to and immobilized on nitrocellulose or other suitable carrier material. In order to identify a clone or DNA that hybridizes with SEQ ID NO: 1 or a subsequence thereof, the carrier material is used in a Southern blot. For purposes of the present invention, hybridization indicates that the polynucleotide hybridizes to a labeled nucleic acid probe corresponding to (i) SEQ ID NO: 1 ; (ii) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 ; (iii) the cDNA sequence thereof; (iv) the full-length complement thereof; or (v) a subsequence thereof; under very low, low stringency conditions, low- medium stringency conditions, medium stringency conditions, medium-high stringency conditions, high stringency conditions to very high stringency conditions. Molecules to which the nucleic acid probe hybridizes under these conditions can be detected using, for example, X-ray film or any other detection means known in the art. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to an polypeptide having DNase activity encoded by a polynucleotide having a sequence identity to the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or the cDNA sequence thereof of at least 60%, e.g., at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91 %, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%.

In an embodiment, the number of amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions introduced into the mature polypeptide of SEQ I D NO: 2 is up to 10, e.g., 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. The amino acid changes may be of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of 1 -30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino- terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to 20-25 residues; or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to variants of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 9 comprising a substitution, deletion, and/or insertion at one or more (e.g., several) positions. In an embodiment, the number of amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions introduced into the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 9 is up to 10, e.g., 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. The amino acid changes may be of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of 1 -30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino- terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to 20-25 residues; or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain. The DNase enzyme may comprise or consist of the amino acid sequence shown as amino acids -37 to 206 of SEQ I D NO: 2 or a fragment thereof that has DNase activity, such as the mature polypeptide. Or the DNase enzyme may comprise or consist of a fragment of amino acids -37 to 206 of SEQ ID NO: 2 or amino acids 1 to 206 of SEQ ID NO: 2 for which fragment one or more amino acids is deleted from the amino and/or carboxyl terminus of SEQ ID NO: 2. The DNase enzyme may comprise or consist of the amino acid sequence shown as amino acids 1 to 204 of SEQ ID NO: 9 or a fragment thereof that has DNase activity, such as the mature polypeptide. Or the DNase enzyme may comprise or consist of a fragment of amino acids 1 to 204 of SEQ ID NO: 9 or amino acids 1 to 204 of SEQ ID NO: 9 for which fragment one or more amino acids is deleted from the amino and/or carboxyl terminus of SEQ I D NO: 9. The present invention also provides DNase polypeptides that are substantially homologous to the polypeptides above, and species homologs (paralogs or orthologs) thereof. The term "substantially homologous" is used herein to denote polypeptides being at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 97% identical, and most preferably at least 99% or more identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9, or a fragment thereof that has DNase activity, or its orthologs or paralogs. In another embodiment, the DNase of SEQ ID NO: 2 comprises a substitution, deletion, and/or insertion at one or more (e.g., several) positions. In another embodiment, the DNase of SEQ ID NO: 9 comprises a substitution, deletion, and/or insertion at one or more (e.g., several) positions. In an embodiment, the number of amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions introduced into the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or into the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 9 is not more than 10, e.g., 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9. The amino acid changes may be of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of 1 -30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino-terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to 20-25 residues; or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain. Examples of conservative substitutions are within the groups of basic amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine), acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine), and small amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine and methionine). Amino acid substitutions that do not generally alter specific activity are known in the art and are described, for example, by H. Neurath and R.L. Hill, 1979, In, The Proteins, Academic Press, New York. Common substitutions are Ala/Ser, Val/lle, Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/Thr, Ser/Asn, Ala/Val, Ser/Gly, Tyr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Asp/Asn, Leu/lle, Leu/Val, Ala/Glu, and Asp/Gly. Alternatively, the amino acid changes are of such a nature that the physico-chemical properties of the polypeptides are altered. For example, amino acid changes may improve the thermal stability of the polypeptide, alter the substrate specificity, change the pH optimum, and the like. Essential amino acids in a polypeptide can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science 244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for DNase activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et a/., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271 : 4699-4708. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction, or photoaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids. See, for example, de Vos et a/., 1992, Science 255: 306-312; Smith et a/., 1992, J. Mol. Biol. 224: 899-904; Wlodaver et a/., 1992, FEBS Lett. 309: 59-64. The identity of essential amino acids can also be inferred from an alignment with a related polypeptide. Single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988, Science 241 : 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 2152-2156; WO 95/17413; or WO 95/22625. Other methods that can be used include error-prone PCR, phage display (e.g., Lowman et ai, 1991 , Biochemistry 30: 10832-10837; U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; WO 92/06204), and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et a/., 1986, Gene 46: 145; Ner et a/., 1988, DNA 7: 127). Mutagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host cells (Ness et a/., 1999, Nature Biotechnology 17: 893-896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using standard methods in the art. These methods allow the rapid determination of the importance of individual amino acid residues in a polypeptide. The polypeptide may be a hybrid polypeptide in which a region of one polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of a region of another polypeptide. The polypeptide may be a fusion polypeptide or cleavable fusion polypeptide in which another polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the polypeptide of the present invention. A fusion polypeptide is produced by fusing a polynucleotide encoding another polypeptide to a polynucleotide of the present invention. Techniques for producing fusion polypeptides are known in the art, and include ligating the coding sequences encoding the polypeptides so that they are in frame and that expression of the fusion polypeptide is under control of the same promoter(s) and terminator. Fusion polypeptides may also be constructed using intein technology in which fusion polypeptides are created post-translationally (Cooper et a/., 1993, EMBO J. 12: 2575-2583; Dawson et ai, 1994, Science 266: 776-779). A fusion polypeptide can further comprise a cleavage site between the two polypeptides. Upon secretion of the fusion protein, the site is cleaved releasing the two polypeptides. Examples of cleavage sites include, but are not limited to, the sites disclosed in Martin et a/., 2003, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 3: 568-576; Svetina et a/., 2000, J. Biotechnol. 76: 245-251 ; Rasmussen- Wilson et a/., 1997, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63: 3488-3493; Ward et a/., 1995, Biotechnology 13: 498-503; and Contreras et ai, 1991 , Biotechnology 9: 378-381 ; Eaton et ai, 1986, Biochemistry 25: 505-512; Collins-Racie et a/., 1995, Biotechnology 13: 982-987; Carter ef a/., 1989, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics 6: 240-248; and Stevens, 2003, Drug Discovery World 4: 35-48. The concentration of the DNase in the wash liquor is typically in the range of 0.00004-100 ppm enzyme protein, such as in the range of 0.00008-100, in the range of 0.0001 -100, in the range of 0.0002-100, in the range of 0.0004-100, in the range of 0.0008-100, in the range of 0.001 -100 ppm enzyme protein, 0.01 -100 ppm enzyme protein, preferably 0.05-50 ppm enzyme protein, more preferably 0.1-50 ppm enzyme protein, more preferably 0.1-30 ppm enzyme protein, more preferably 0.5-20 ppm enzyme protein, and most preferably 0.5-10 ppm enzyme protein.

Thus, the detergent composition may comprise at least 0.00008% DNase protein, preferably at least 0.002%, 0.003%, 0.004%, 0.005%, 0.006%, 0.008%, 0.01 %, 0.02%, 0.03%, 0.05%, 0.1 %, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9% or 1.0% of DNase protein. The DNase of the detergent composition of the invention may be stabilized using conventional stabilizing agents, e.g. a polyol such as propylene glycol or glycerol, a sugar or sugar alcohol, lactic acid, boric acid, or a boric acid derivative, e.g. an aromatic borate ester, or a phenyl boronic acid derivative such as 4-formylphenyl boronic acid, and the composition may be formulated as described in, for example, W092/19709 and W092/19708. A polypeptide of the present invention may also be incorporated in the detergent formulations disclosed in WO97/07202, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Detergent compositions In one embodiment, the invention is directed to detergent compositions comprising an enzyme of the present invention in combination with one or more additional cleaning composition components. In one embodiment, the detergent composition comprises a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9. In another embodiment, the detergent comprises a polypeptide consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8 and a polypeptide of the present invention consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9. In one embodiment the detergent composition is in solid form. In another embodiment, the detergent composition is in a liquid form. The choice of additional components is within the skill of the artisan and includes conventional ingredients, including the exemplary non-limiting components set forth below. Liquid detergent composition The liquid detergent composition may comprise a microcapsule of the invention, and thus form part of, any detergent composition in any form, such as liquid and powder detergents, and soap and detergent bars. In one embodiment, the invention is directed to liquid detergent compositions comprising a microcapsule, as described above, in combination with one or more additional cleaning composition components. The microcapsule, as described above, may be added to the liquid detergent composition in an amount corresponding to from 0.0001 % to 5% (w/w) active enzyme protein (AEP); preferably from 0.001 % to 5%, more preferably from 0.005% to 5%, more preferably from 0.005% to 4%, more preferably from 0.005% to 3%, more preferably from 0.005% to 2%, even more preferably from 0.01 % to 2%, and most preferably from 0.01 % to 1 % (w/w) active enzyme protein. The liquid detergent composition has a physical form, which is not solid (or gas). It may be a pourable liquid, a paste, a pourable gel or a non-pourable gel. It may be either isotropic or structured, preferably isotropic. It may be a formulation useful for washing in automatic washing machines or for hand washing. It may also be a personal care product, such as a shampoo, toothpaste, or a hand soap. The liquid detergent composition may be aqueous, typically containing at least 20% by weight and up to 95% water, such as up to 70% water, up to 50% water, up to 40% water, up to 30% water, or up to 20% water. Other types of liquids, including without limitation, alkanols, amines, diols, ethers and polyols may be included in an aqueous liquid detergent. An aqueous liquid detergent may contain from 0-30% organic solvent. A liquid detergent may even be non-aqueous, wherein the water content is below 10%, preferably below 5%. Detergent ingredients can be separated physically from each other by compartments in water dissolvable pouches. Thereby negative storage interaction between components can be avoided. Different dissolution profiles of each of the compartments can also give rise to delayed dissolution of selected components in the wash solution. The detergent composition may take the form of a unit dose product. A unit dose product is the packaging of a single dose in a non-reusable container. It is increasingly used in detergents for laundry. A detergent unit dose product is the packaging (e.g., in a pouch made from a water soluble film) of the amount of detergent used for a single wash. Pouches can be of any form, shape and material which is suitable for holding the composition, e.g., without allowing the release of the composition from the pouch prior to water contact. The pouch is made from water soluble film which encloses an inner volume. Said inner volume can be divided into compartments of the pouch. Preferred films are polymeric materials preferably polymers which are formed into a film or sheet. Preferred polymers, copolymers or derivates thereof are selected polyacrylates, and water soluble acrylate copolymers, methyl cellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose, sodium dextrin, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, malto dextrin, poly methacrylates, most preferably polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Preferably the level of polymer in the film for example PVA is at least about 60%. Preferred average molecular weight will typically be about 20,000 to about 150,000. Films can also be a blend compositions comprising hydrolytically degradable and water soluble polymer blends such as polyactide and polyvinyl alcohol (known under the Trade reference M8630 as sold by Chris Craft In. Prod. Of Gary, Ind., US) plus plasticizers like glycerol, ethylene glycerol, Propylene glycol, sorbitol and mixtures thereof. The pouches can comprise a solid laundry cleaning composition or part components and/or a liquid cleaning composition or part components separated by the water soluble film. The compartment for liquid components can be different in composition than compartments containing solids (see e.g., US 2009/001 1970). The choice of detergent components may include, for textile care, the consideration of the type of textile to be cleaned, the type and/or degree of soiling, the temperature at which cleaning is to take place, and the formulation of the detergent product. Although components mentioned below are categorized by general header according to a particular functionality, this is not to be construed as a limitation, as a component may comprise additional functionalities as will be appreciated by the skilled artisan. The choice of additional components is within the skill of the artisan and includes conventional ingredients, including the exemplary non-limiting components set forth below. Surfactants The detergent composition may comprise one or more surfactants, which may be anionic and/or cationic and/or non-ionic and/or semi-polar and/or zwitterionic, or a mixture thereof.

When included therein, the detergent will usually contain from about 1 % to about 40% by weigh of a cationic surfactant, for example from about 0.5% to about 30%, in particular from about 1 % to about 20%, from about 3% to about 10%, such as from about 3% to about 5%, from about 8% to about 12% or from about 10% to about 12%. Non-limiting examples of cationic surfactants include alkyldimethylethanolamine quat (ADMEAQ), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), dimethyldistearylammonium chloride (DSDMAC), and alkylbenzyldimethylammonium, alkyl quaternary ammonium compounds, alkoxylated quaternary ammonium (AQA) compounds, ester quats, and combinations thereof.

When included therein, the detergent will usually contain from about 0% to about 40% by weight of a zwitterionic surfactant. Non-limiting examples of zwitterionic surfactants include betaines such as alkyldimethylbetaines, sulfobetaines, and combinations thereof. Hydrotropes A hydrotrope is a compound that solubilises hydrophobic compounds in aqueous solutions (or oppositely, polar substances in a non-polar environment). Typically, hydrotropes have both hydrophilic and a hydrophobic character (so-called amphiphilic properties as known from surfactants); however the molecular structure of hydrotropes generally do not favor spontaneous self-aggregation, see e.g. review by Hodgdon and Kaler (2007), Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 12: 121 -128. Hydrotropes do not display a critical concentration above which self- aggregation occurs as found for surfactants and lipids forming miceller, lamellar or other well defined meso-phases. Instead, many hydrotropes show a continuous-type aggregation process where the sizes of aggregates grow as concentration increases. However, many hydrotropes alter the phase behavior, stability, and colloidal properties of systems containing substances of polar and non-polar character, including mixtures of water, oil, surfactants, and polymers. Hydrotropes are classically used across industries from pharma, personal care, food, to technical applications. Use of hydrotropes in detergent compositions allow for example more concentrated formulations of surfactants (as in the process of compacting liquid detergents by removing water) without inducing undesired phenomena such as phase separation or high viscosity. The detergent may contain 0-10% by weight, for example 0-5% by weight, such as about 0.5 to about 5%, or about 3% to about 5%, of a hydrotrope. Any hydrotrope known in the art for use in detergents may be utilized. Non-limiting examples of hydrotropes include sodium benzenesulfonate, sodium p-toluene sulfonate (STS), sodium xylene sulfonate (SXS), sodium cumene sulfonate (SCS), sodium cymene sulfonate, amine oxides, alcohols and polyglycolethers, sodium hydroxynaphthoate, sodium hydroxynaphthalene sulfonate, sodium ethylhexyl sulfate, and combinations thereof. Builders and Co-Builders The detergent composition may contain about 0-65% by weight, such as about 5% to about 50% of a detergent builder or co-builder, or a mixture thereof. The builder and/or co-builder may particularly be a chelating agent that forms water-soluble complexes with Ca and Mg. Any builder and/or co-builder known in the art for use in detergents may be utilized. Non-limiting examples of builders include zeolites, diphosphates (pyrophosphates), triphosphates such as sodium triphosphate (STP or STPP), carbonates such as sodium carbonate, soluble silicates such as sodium metasilicate, layered silicates (e.g., SKS-6 from Hoechst), ethanolamines such as 2-aminoethan-1-ol (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA, also known as 2,2'-iminodiethan-1-ol), triethanolamine (TEA, also known as 2,2',2"-nitrilotriethan-1 -ol), and (carboxymethyl)inulin (CMI), and combinations thereof. The detergent composition may also contain 0-50% by weight, such as about 5% to about 30%, of a detergent co-builder. The detergent composition may include include a co-builder alone, or in combination with a builder, for example a zeolite builder. Non-limiting examples of co-builders include homopolymers of polyacrylates or copolymers thereof, such as poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) or copoly(acrylic acid/maleic acid) (PAA/PMA).

Wash assays Launder-O-Meter (LOM) Model Wash System The Launder-O-Meter (LOM) is a medium scale model wash system that can be applied to test up to 20 different wash conditions simultaneously. A LOM is basically a large temperature controlled water bath with 20 closed metal beakers rotating inside it. Each beaker constitutes one small washing machine and during an experiment, each will contain a solution of a specific detergent/enzyme system to be tested along with the soiled and unsoiled fabrics it is tested on. Mechanical stress is achieved by the beakers being rotated in the water bath and by including metal balls in the beaker. The LOM model wash system is mainly used in medium scale testing of detergents and enzymes at European wash conditions. In a LOM experiment, factors such as the ballast to soil ratio and the fabric to wash liquor ratio can be varied. Therefore, the LOM provides the link between small scale experiments, such as AMSA and mini-wash, and the more time consuming full scale experiments in front loader washing machines. Mini Launder-O-Meter (MiniLOM) Model Wash System MiniLOM is a modified mini wash system of the Launder-O-Meter (LOM), which is a medium scale model wash system that can be applied to test up to 20 different wash conditions simultaneously. A LOM is basically a large temperature controlled water bath with 20 closed metal beakers rotating inside it. Each beaker constitutes one small washing machine and during an experiment, each will contain a solution of a specific detergent/enzyme system to be tested along with the soiled and unsoiled fabrics it is tested on. Mechanical stress is achieved by the beakers being rotated in the water bath and by including metal balls in the beaker. The LOM model wash system is mainly used in medium scale testing of detergents and enzymes at European wash conditions. In a LOM experiment, factors such as the ballast to soil ratio and the fabric to wash liquor ratio can be varied. Therefore, the LOM provides the link between small scale experiments, such as AMSA and mini-wash, and the more time consuming full scale experiments in front loader washing machines. In miniLOM, washes are performed in 50 ml test tubes placed in Stuart rotator. Terg-O-timeter (TOM) wash assay The Tergo-To-Meter (TOM) is a medium scale model wash system that can be applied to test 12 different wash conditions simultaneously. A TOM is basically a large temperature controlled water bath with up to 12 open metal beakers submerged into it. Each beaker constitutes one small top loader style washing machine and during an experiment, each of them will contain a solution of a specific detergent/enzyme system and the soiled and unsoiled fabrics its performance is tested on. Mechanical stress is achieved by a rotating stirring arm, which stirs the liquid within each beaker. Because the TOM beakers have no lid, it is possible to withdraw samples during a TOM experiment and assay for information on-line during wash. The TOM model wash system is mainly used in medium scale testing of detergents and enzymes at US or LA/AP wash conditions. In a TOM experiment, factors such as the ballast to soil ratio and the fabric to wash liquor ratio can be varied. Therefore, the TOM provides the link between small scale experiments, such as AMSA and mini-wash, and the more time consuming full scale experiments in top loader washing machines. Equipment: The water bath with 12 steel beakers and 1 rotating arm per beaker with capacity of 500 or 1200ml_ of detergent solution. Temperature ranges from 5 to 80°C. The water bath has to be filled up with deionised water. Rotational speed can be set up to 70 to 120rpm/min. Set temperature in the Terg-O-Tometer and start the rotation in the water bath. Wait for the temperature to adjust (tolerance is +/- 0,5°C). All beakers shall be clean and without traces of prior test material. The wash solution with desired amount of detergent, temperature and water hardness is prepared in a bucket. The detergent is allowed to dissolve during magnet stirring for 10 min. Wash solution shall be used within 30 to 60 min after preparation. 800ml wash solution is added into a TOM beaker. The wash solution is agitated at 120rpm and optionally one or more enzymes are added to the beaker. The swatches are sprinkled into the beaker and then the ballast load. Time measurement starts when the swatches and ballast are added to the beaker. The swatches are washed for 20 minutes after which agitation is terminated. The wash load is subsequently transferred from the TOM beaker to a sieve and rinse with cold tap water. The soid swatches are separated from the ballast load. The soil swatches are transferred to a 5L beaker with cold tap water under running water for 5 minuttes. The ballast load is kept separately for the coming inactivation. The water is gently pressed out of the swatches by hand and placed on a tray covered with a paper. Another paper is palced on top of the swatches. The swatches are allowed to dry overnight before subjecting the swatches to analysis, such as measuring the color intensity using a Color Eye as described herein. Enzyme assays Assay I: testing of DNase activity DNase activity was determined on DNase Test Agar with Methyl Green (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), which was prepared according to the manual from supplier. Briefly, 21 g of agar was dissolved in 500 ml water and then autoclaved for 15 min at 121 °C. Autoclaved agar was temperated to 48°C in water bath, and 20 ml of agar was poured into petridishes with and allowed to solidify by incubation o/n at room temperature. On solidified agar plates, 5 μΙ of enzyme solutions are added, and DNase activity are observed as colorless zones around the spotted enzyme solutions. Assay II Analysis of E-2-nonenal on textile using an electronic nose. One way of testing for the presence of malodor on textiles is by using E-2-Nonenal as a marker for the malodor, as this compound contributes to the malodor on laundry. Add a solution of E-2-nonenal to a 5 cm x 5 cm textile swatch and place the swatch in a 20 ml. glass vial for GC analysis and cap the vial. Analyze 5 ml. headspace from the capped vials in a Heracles II Electronic nose from Alpha M.O.S., France (double column gas chromatograph with 2 FIDs, column 1 : MXT5 and column 2: MXT1701 ) after 20 minutes incubation at 40°C. Examples Methods General methods of PCR, cloning, ligation nucleotides etc. are well-known to a person skilled in the art and may for example be found in in "Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual", Sambrook et al. (1989), Cold Spring Harbor lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds.); "Current protocols in Molecular Biology", John Wiley and Sons, (1995); Harwood, C. R., and Cutting, S. M. (eds.); "DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach, Volumes I and II", D.N. Glover ed. (1985); "Oligonucleotide Synthesis", M.J. Gait ed. (1984); "Nucleic Acid Hybridization", B.D. Hames & S.J. Higgins eds (1985); "A Practical Guide To Molecular Cloning", B. Perbal, (1984). Example 1 PCR amplification All PCR amplifications was performed in a volume of 100 microL containing 2.5 units Taq po-lymerase, 100 ng of pS02, 250 nM of each dNTP, and 10 pmol of each of the two primers de- scribed above in a reaction buffer of 50 mM KCI, 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0, 1.5 mM MgCI2. Amplification was carried out in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA Termal 480, and consisted of one cycle of 3 minutes at 94°C, followed by 25 cycles of 1 minute at 94°C, 30 seconds at 55°C, and 1 minute at 72°C. Aspergillus transformation Aspergillus oryzae NBRC4177: available from Institute for fermentation, Osaka; 17-25 Juso, Hammachi 2-Chome Yodogawa-Ku, Osaka, Japan. Aspergillus transformation was done as described by Christensen et al.; Biotechnology 1988 6 1419-1422. In short, A.oryzae mycelia were grown in a rich nutrient broth. The mycelia were separated from the broth by filtration. The enzyme preparation Novozyme® (Novozymes) was added to the mycelia in osmotically stabilizing buffer such as 1.2 M MgS04 buffered to pH 5.0 with sodium phosphate. The suspension was incubated for 60 minutes at 37 degrees C with agitation. The protoplast was filtered through mira-cloth to remove mycelial debris. The protoplast was harvested and washed twice with STC (1.2 M sorbitol, 10 mM CaCI2, 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5). The protoplasts were finally re-suspended in 200-1000 microl STC. For transformation, 5 μg DNA was added to 100 μΙ protoplast suspension and then 200 μΙ PEG solution (60% PEG 4000, 10 mM CaCI2, 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5) was added and the mixture is incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. The protoplast were harvested and washed twice with 1.2 M sorbitol. The protoplast was finally re-suspended 200 μΙ 1.2 M sorbitol. Transformants containing the amdS gene were selected for its ability to used aceteamide as the sole source for nitrogen on minimal plates (Cove D.J. 1966. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1 13:51-56) containing 1.0 M sucrose as carbon source, 10 mM aceteamide as nitrogen source. After 4-5 days of growth at 37 degrees C, stable transformants appeared as vigorously growing and sporulating colonies. Transformants were purified twice through conidiospores on the above selection plates. Example 2 Construction of the Aspergillus expression cassette pJaL1368 For expression of an A. oryzae gene (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) encoding a putative nuclease SEQ ID NO: 2) the coding region containing introns (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) was amplified as a PCR fragment on 931 bp by primer set oJal_316 (SEQ ID NO: 3) and oJal_317 (SEQ ID NO: 4) using A. oryzae NBRC4177 genomic DNA as template. The 931 bp PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and Xhol resulting in a 919 bp fragment (SEQ ID NO: 5). The 919 BamHI-Xhol fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites in pJal_1262, giving plasmid pJal_1368. Example 3 Expression of putative A. oryzae nuclease gene in Aspergillus oryzae strain MT3568 The Aspergillus expression plasmid pJal_1368 was transformed into the Aspergillus oryzae strains MT3568 as described by Christensen et al.; Biotechnology 1988 6 1419-1422. Twelve randomly selected transformants were purified and inoculated into tubes containing 10 ml YPM medium (2 g/l yeast extract, 2 g/l peptone, and 2% maltose), which was incubated at 30 C, with shaking (200 rpm) for 4 days. Transformants which produced the A. oryzae AO090701000540 protein were identified by the appearance of an extra band on approximately 25 kD (calculated molecule weight 23893 Da) compared to supernatant from an untransformed parental strain. The identities of the band were confirmed by 1 ) determination of the N-terminal end by Edman degradation and 2) InGel digestion and MS/MS. N-terminal determination gave two dominant N- terminal sequences ALKTGSG (SEQ ID NO: 6) and KTGSGDS (SEQ ID NO: 7). The MS/MS data further confirm that the putative gene (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) encodes the mature proteins SEQ ID NO: 8 and SEQ ID NO: 9, that is part of the protein in SEQ I D NO: 2. The following examples uses the Aspergillus oryzae DNAse obtained from the above mentioned Aspergillus oryzae strains MT3568 transformed with pJaL1368. Example 4 Performance of Aspergillus oryzae DNase (SEQ ID NO: 2) in model detergents and commercial detergents Isolating laundry specific bacterial strains One strain of Brevundimonas sp. isolated from laundry was used in the present example. The Brevundimonas sp. was isolated during a study, where the bacterial diversity in laundry after washing at 15, 40 and 60°C, respectively, was investigated. The study was conducted on laundry collected from Danish households. For each wash, 20 g of laundry items (tea towel, towel, dish cloth, bib, T-shirt armpit, T-shirt collar, socks) in the range 4:3:2:2: 1 :1 : 1 was used. Washing was performed in a Laundr-O-Meter (LOM) at 15, 40 or 60°C. For washing at 15 and 40°C, Ariel Sensitive White & Color was used, whereas WFK IEC-A* model detergent was used for washing at 60°C. Ariel Sensitive White & Color was prepared by weighing out 5.1 g and adding tap water up to 1000 ml followed by stirring for 5 minutes. WFK IEC-A* model detergent (which is available from WFK Testgewebe GmbH) was prepared by weighing out 5 g and adding tap water up to 1300 ml followed by stirring for 15 min. Washing was performed for 1 hour at 15, 40 and 60°C, respectively, followed by 2 times rinsing with tap water for 20 min at 15°C. Laundry was sampled immediately after washing at 15, 40 and 60°C, respectively. Twenty grams of laundry was added 0.9% (w/v) NaCI (1 .06404; Merck, Damstadt, Germany) with 0.5% (w/w) tween 80 to yield a 1 :10 dilution in stomacher bag. The mixture was homogenized using a Stomacher for 2 minutes at medium speed. After homogenization, ten-fold dilutions were prepared in 0.9% (w/v) NaCI. Bacteria were enumerated on Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) (CM0129, Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) incubated aerobically at 30°C for 5-7 days. To suppress growth of yeast and moulds, 0.2% sorbic acid (359769, Sigma) and 0.1 % cycloheximide (18079; Sigma) were added. Bacterial colonies were selected from countable plates and purified by restreaking twice on TSA. For long time storage, purified isolates were stored at -80°C in TSB containing 20% (w/v) glycerol (49779; Sigma). Preparation of donor swatches with biofilm Brevundimonas sp. was pre-grown on Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) (pH 7.3) (CM0131 ; Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) for 2-5 days at 30°C. From a single colony, a loop-full was transferred to 10 mL of TSB and incubated for 1 day at 30°C with shaking (240 rpm). After propagation, Brevundimonas sp. was pelleted by centrifugation (Sigma Laboratory Centrifuge 6K15) (3000 g at 21 °C in 7 min) and resuspended in 10 mL of TSB diluted twice with water. Optical density (OD) at 600 nm was measured using a spectophometer (POLARstar Omega (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). Fresh TSB diluted twice with water was inoculated to an OD60onm of 0.03, and 1.6 mL was added into each well of a 12-well polystyrene flat-bottom microplate (3512; Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA), in which a round swatch (diameter 2 cm) of sterile Polyester WFK30A was placed. After incubation (24 h at 15°C with shaking (100 rpm), swatches were rinsed twice with 0.9% (w/v) NaCI. Washing experiment Five rinsed swatches with Brevundimonas sp. was mixed with five sterile Polyester WFK30A swatches in a 50 mL test tube and added 10 mL of detergent wash solution comprising the following detergent composition in mentioned concentrations: model detergent A (EU, 3.3 g/L), Ariel Actilift (EU, 6.9 g/L), Persil Small & Mighty (EU, 4 g/L), Fairy (EU, 5.6 g/L) and Tide Original (US, 3.2 g/L), Model detergent T (EU, 5.3 g/L), Model detergent X (D&E, 1.8 g/L), Ariel (EU, 5.3 g/L) and Persil Megaperls (EU, 4.0 g/L) was added together with 0.7 g/L soil (Pigmentschmutz, 09V, wfk, Krefeld, Germany) and Aspergillus oryzae DNase (0.04 ppm) found DNase positive on DNase Test Agar with Methyl Green (Assay I). Test tubes were placed in a Stuart rotator (Mini LOM) for 1 hour at 30°C. Swatches were rinsed twice with tap water and dried on filter paper over night. As controls, washes with mentioned detergents and without addition of A. oryzae DNase were made in parallel. Color difference (L values) was measured using a Color Eye (Macbeth Color Eye 7000 reflectance spectrophotometer). The measurements were made without UV in the incident light and the L value from the CIE Lab color space was extracted. When referred to EU conditions above, e.g. (EU, 3.3 g/L) water with hardness 15°dH (Ca:Mg:NaHC03 4:1 :1.5) was used. For US detergents (US, 3.2 g/L), water with hardness 6°dH (Ca:Mg:NaHC032:1 : 1.5) was used. For D&E (developing and emerging markets) detergents (D&E, 1.8 g/L), water with hardness 14°dH (Ca:Mg:NaHC032:1 : 1.5) was used. The present example shows that A. oryzae DNase prevents soil deposition (anti- redeposition) to polyester swatches pre-grown with bacteria (donors) as well as sterile polyester swatches (tracers) added to the wash. Prevention of soil deposition was both observed in liquid detergents with pH 8.0, but also in powder detergents with pH 10 and Tide Pods. The observed effect is due to the deep cleaning effects of A. oryzae DNase (SEQ ID NO: 2). Most importantly, the present example shows that A. oryzae DNase will prevent transfer of soil between different textile items in a wash and thus enable that dirty laundry can be washed with less dirty laundry. This ensures that the whiteness of the textile is improved.

Five rinsed swatches with Brevundimonas sp. was mixed with five sterile swatches in a 50 ml. test tube and added 10 mL of model detergent A wash solution model detergent A (EU, 3.3 g/L) containing 0.7 g/L soil (Pigmentschmutz, 09V, wfk, Krefeld, Germany) and Aspergillus oryzae DNase (0.04 ppm). Test tubes were placed in a Stuart rotator (MiniLOM) for 1 hour at 30°C. Swatches were rinsed twice with tap water and dried on filter paper over night. As controls, washes without addition of A. oryzae DNase were made in parallel. Color difference (L values) was measured using a Color Eye (Macbeth Color Eye 7000 reflectance spectrophotometer). The measurements were made without UV in the incident light and the L value from the CIE Lab color space was extracted. The present example shows that A. oryzae DNase prevents soil deposition (anti-redeposition) to various types of textiles and that the whiteness of the textile is improved when A. oryzae DNase is present. Table 2 Type of textile Color difference (AL) Cotton (WFK10A) 3.5 Cotton/Polyester (WFK20A) 5.4 Polyester (WFK30A) 7.5 Polyamide (WFK40A) 3.3 Polyacryl (WFK50A) 7.2 Silk (WFK70A) 4.5 Example 6 Stability of Aspergillus oryzae DNAse in model detergent A In order to investigate detergent and protease stability of A. oryzae DNase, 20 g of model detergent A was weighed out into a 50 ml test tube and added 1.35% (w/w) protease 1 and protease 2, respectively. Furthermore, 2 g/l and 4 g/l of protease inhibitor system 1 or 2 g/l of protease inhibitor system 2 were added. After incubation at -18°C and 37°C, respectively, deep-cleaning effects were investigated on Brevundimonas sp. swatches. As controls, model detergent A with and without addition of A. oryzae DNase prior to wash was used. Color difference (L values) was measured using a Color Eye (Macbeth Color Eye 7000 reflectance spectrophotometer). The measurements were made without UV in the incident light and the L value from the CIE Lab color space was extracted. The present example shows that A. oryzae DNase is stable in liquid detergent as well as in liquid detergent added various proteases and protease inhibitor systems. The protease 1 used in this experiment is SEQ ID NO: 10 with the following modification M222S. Protease 2 is SEQ ID NO: 10 with the following modification: N76D+G195E. Protease inhibitor system 1 is 4-Formyl-Phenyl-Boronic Acid as described in patent application WO 1996/041859. Protease inhibitor system 2 is the compound Cbz-Gly-Ala-Tyr-H as described in patent application WO 2009/1 18375. Table 3 Example 7 Add on effect of DNAse In order to investigate whether the observed deep cleaning and whitening effects of A. oryzae DNAse is unique for A. oryzae DNAse in comparison to existing laundry a comparable study was performed. Brevundimonas sp. was on grown on round swatches (diameter 2 cm) of polyester (WFK30A) for 1 day (see example 4 - preparation of donor swatches). Five rinsed swatches with Brevundimonas sp. was mixed with five sterile swatches in a 50 ml. test tube and added 10 ml. of model detergent A wash solution (for composition see example 4) containing 0.7 g/L soil (Pigmentschmutz, 09V, wfk, Krefeld, Germany) and enzyme. Following enzymes were used: Aspergillus oryzae DNase (0.04 ppm) (SEQ ID NO: 2), Celluclean™ 5000L (0.002 ppm), Celluclean™ 5.0T (0.001 ppm), Carezyme™ (0.2 ppm), Savinase™ (2.7 ppm), Lipex™ (0.06 ppm) and Stainzyme™ (0.2 ppm) (all enzymes supplied by Novozymes A/S). The concentration in ppm represents the concentration of enzyme in wash liquor. In parallel, a control not added enzyme was made. Test tubes were placed in a Stuart rotator (MiniLOM) for 1 hour at 30°C. Swatches were rinsed twice with tap water and dried on filter paper over night. Color difference (L value) was measured using a Color Eye (Macbeth Color Eye 7000 reflectance spectrophotometer). The measurements were made without UV in the incident light and the L value from the CIE Lab color space was extracted. The present example shows that A. oryzae DNase prevents soil deposition (anti-redeposition) and improves the whitening as the only one of the tested laundry enzymes indicating that the deep-cleaning and whitening effect by A. oryzae DNAse is an add on effect in comparison to existing laundry enzymes. Table 4 Example 8 Detection of sweaty odor on T-shirts for running Two white T-shirts for running made of 100% polyester were prewashed in a washing machine using 3.33 g/L of model detergent A. The two T-shirts were worn by a test person (male), one T-shirt at the time. The test person wore each of the the T-shirts during physical activity for one hour. After wearing, one T-shirt was washed in a washing machine using 3.33 g/L of model detergent A with the DNAse of SEQ ID NO: 2 (1 ppm), whereas the second T-shirt was washed in a washing machine using 3.33 g/L of model detergent A without the DNAse (0 ppm). The T-shirts were washed as described in the full scale wash described above and for washing, 15 L of tap water was used. Both T-shirts were worn during physical activity and then washed. This wear and wash cycle was repeated 10 times For evaluation of odor, a trained test person investigated T-shirts prior to use for sweaty odor (malodor) by smelling to T-shirts. If a sweaty odor was detected, a mark (X) was added in the table below. The observations below show that washing with DNase during 10 washes prevents accumulation of odor. Table 5 Example 9 This example shows that stain removal of enzymes like protease, amylase, lipase, mannanase, pectate lyase and cellulase in a wash is not diminished by the presence of DNase. Stain removal was shown on the following stains (effective enzyme in brackets): C-S-10 Butterfat (lipase), C-S-03 Chocolate milk/soot (protease), C-S-28 Rice starch with color (amylase), C-S-73 Locust bean gum with pigment (mannanase), C-S-54 Oatmeal/Chocolate (cellulase), all from Center For Testmaterials BV, the Netherlands, and 013KC Fresh Banana (pectate lyase) from Warwick Equest Ltd., United Kingdom. All stains were cut in 4x9 cm swatches except C-S-10 Butterfat which was cut in 5x5 cm swatches and stain 013KC which was a 05 cm circular stain on a 10x10 cm swatch. Two swatches of each stain were attached to a Tea towel (100 % cotton) by a stapler. One tea towel with the stained swatches attached was added to each machine together with 3 kg of ballast consisting of: 3 T-shirts (100% cotton), 10 shirts with short sleeves (55% cotton, 45% polyester), 4 pillow cases (35% cotton, 65% polyester) (1 10x75cm), 1 small bed sheet (100% cotton) (100x75cm), and 4 tea towels (100% cotton). The washes were made in Miele Softtronic W2445 washing machines at 30°C using a standard wash program with 12-13 liters water to 3 kg textile. The washes were done with 3.33 g/L of model detergent A as described above in Bagsvaard tap water and a HI 9635 conductivity meter from Hanna Instruments, Canada, was used for measuring the conductivity of the water to 919μ8 at 21 °C. Enzymes were added to the 4 washes in amounts as described in the below table: Table 6 The enzymes were added to the washing machines in separate plastic beakers dissolved in 100 mL 15°dH water (15°dH water: 3.00 mL of 0.713 mol/L CaCI2, 1.50 mL of 0.357 mol/L MgCI2 and 0.3371 g of NaHC03 into a 1 L measuring cylinder, fill up to 1 L with MilliQ water). A separate plastic beaker was used for DNase, another plastic beaker was used for protease and the remaining enzymes (amylase, lipase, mannanase, pectate lyase and cellulose) were dissolved in a third plastic beaker. The beakers were placed inside the drum of the washing machine before the wash was started. After wash the swatches were dried overnight on filter paper and remission was measured at 460 nm as described above. The C-S-10 Butterfat swatches were measured 22 hours after end of wash. The average remission at 460 nm for the stained swatches after wash is shown in the table below. The higher the remission value the cleaner the swatch after wash. Table 7 Machine 1 2 3 4 Enzymes added: No DNase P, A, L, M, PL, P, A, L, M, PL, C + C DNase Remission at 460 nm Oatmeal/Chocolate 40.35 39.64 57.22 58.30 Fresh Banana 52.50 47.61 68.37 73.97 Chocolate milk 36.55 36.61 56.1 1 55.66 Locust bean gum 42.63 44.05 55.1 1 54.65 Rice starch 51.57 47.09 69.17 73.97 Butterfat 52.48 52.06 56.44 56.58 P= protease, A= amylase, L= lipase, M= mannanase, PL= pectate lyase, C= cellulase Based on a two tailed T-test (with unequal variance) the average remission values for each stain type in wash 3 are not statistically significantly different from wash 4 on a 5% significance level. The results show that stain removal of enzymes like protease, amylase, lipase, mannanase, pectate lyase and cellulase is not diminished by the presence of DNase in a wash. Example 10 A wash experiment was conducted on a collection of running clothes (sweatshirts and running T-shirts), which had been worn during training exercises for at least 50 times and washed in between. During the training exercises the running clothes had become damp of sweat but generally not soiled. The running clothes had previous been washed in a Miele Softtronic W5825 at 30°C (low filling of the machine) using BioTex Black (Unilever) in a recommended standard dose. Before conducting the present experiment, the sweatshirt and running T-shirt (100 % polyester) was evaluated by a trained odor panelist, who found a pronounced odor of sour sweat (malodor), in particular present in the armpit of the clothes. The malodor was present after washing the clothes using BioTex Black and the malodor accumulated with the number of times the running clothes were used. The running clothes was washed in a Miele Softtronic W5825 at 30°C (low filling of the machine) using standard dose of BioTex black and a dose of A. oryzae DNase (0.4 ppm) in the wash liquor. Between each training exercises, the running clothes were subjected to another round of assessment by the odor panelist. The odor panelist found that the malodor was significantly reduced and hardly detectable after 1 to 3 wash cycles in the presence of the A. oryzae DNAse of the present invention. In an extending study, the running clothes were washed in the presence of the A. oryzae DNAse of the present invention every time the clothes were washed. The odor panelist found that when the running clothes had been washed in the presence of the A. oryzae DNAse it could be worn for at least two training exercises (allowing the clothes to dry without washing the clothes between the training exercises) before malodor was clearly detectable. Example 11 Stability of Aspergillus oryzae DNAse, comparative study Sample detergent preparation Sample detergent was prepared according to the specifications in the below table (Table 8) and stored for four weeks at constant temperature (-18°C, 30°C and 37°C, respectively). Table 8 Bl DNAse: Bacillus licheniformis DNAse (the mature peptide of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 1 ); Ao DNase: Apergillus oryzae DNAse; Savinase (protease, sequence set foth in SEQ ID NO: 10), NA: No Information not available. Preparation of donor swatches with biofilm Brevundimonas sp. was pre-grown on Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) (pH 7.3) (CM0131 ; Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) for 2-5 days at 30°C. From a single colony, a loop-full was transferred to 10 mL of TSB and incubated for 1 day at 30°C with shaking (240 rpm). After propagation, Brevundimonas sp. was pelleted by centrifugation (Sigma Laboratory Centrifuge 6K15) (3000 g at 21 °C in 7 min) and resuspended in 10 mL of TSB diluted twice with water. Optical density (OD) at 600 nm was measured using a spectophometer (POLARstar Omega (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). Fresh TSB diluted twice with water was inoculated to an OD600nm of 0.03, and 20 mL was added to a Petri dish, in which 5 cm x 5 cm swatch of sterile Polyester WFK30A was placed. After incubation (24 h at 15°C with shaking (100 rpm), swatches were rinsed twice with 0.9% (w/v) NaCI. Round swatches (1 cm in diameter) were subsequently punched out of the 5 cm x 5 cm donor swatches. The round swatches were used for the washing experiment. Wash The wash liquor was prepared by weighing the amount of detergent needed for the assay into a flask, i.e. Model detergent A 3.3 g/L; Ariel Actilift Color & Style 6.9 g/L dissolved in sterile MilliQ water with a hardness of 15°dH. Soil was prepared by resuspending the soil (Pigmentschmutz, 09V, wfk, Krefeld, Germany) in tap water and stirring the suspension for 30 min. before use. Soil was subsequently added to each flask soil to reach a concentration of 0.35 g soil/L (Pigmentschmutz, 09V, wfk, Krefeld, Germany) and flasks was filled with tap water to the final volume (4 ml). The round swatches was placed in a 24 well format plate (two round swatches obtained from the same donor swatch per well). A mechanical stress object (MSO), in the form of an elongated metal object (1 cm) covered with plastic, was place in each well. The plate was placed in a Hamilton robot and subjected to a wash simulation program using the following conditions: Duration of wash cycle: 30 minutes with shaking (1000 rpm); temperature 30°C; Volume of wash liquor (total): 4 ml per well. During the washing time, the plate is shaken in orbital manner to bring the test solution in contact with the textile and apply mechanical stress in a regular, periodic oscillating manner. After completion of the wash simulation cycle, the swatches was removed from the wash liquor and let dry on a filter paper. The dried swatches were fixed on a sheet of white paper for scanning. The wash performance is measured as the brightness of the colour of the textile washed. Brightness can also be expressed as the intensity of the light reflected from the sample when illuminated with white light. When the sample is stained the intensity of the reflected light is lower, than that of a clean sample. Therefore the intensity of the reflected light can be used to measure wash performance. Colour measurements are made with a flatbed scanner (EPSON V750 PRO), which is used to capture an image of the washed textile. To extract a value for the light intensity from the scanned images, 24-bit pixel values from the image are converted into values for red, green and blue (RGB). The intensity value (Int) is calculated by adding the RGB values together as vectors th of the resulting vector: Table 9 Detergent Enzyme(s) Intensity Intensity Intensity Alntensity Alntensity (-18°C) (30°C) (37°C) (-18°C - 30°C) (-18°C - 37°C) Model Detergent A Bl DNase 439 439 438 < 5 < 5 Bl DNase Model Detergent A 436 430 416 5 20 + Savinase Model Detergent A Ao DNase 439 438 437 < 5 < 5 Ao DNase Model Detergent A 439 439 438 < 5 < 5 + Savinase Ariel Actilift Colour & Bl DNase 439 438 439 65 26 Style Ariel Actilift Colour & Ao DNase 439 438 439 < 5 < 5 Style Model Detergent A - 350 Ariel Actilift Colour & - 392 Style Bl DNAse: Bacillus licheniformis DNAse (the mature peptide of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 1 ); Ao DNase: Apergillus oryzae DNAse, Savinase (protease, sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 10). Conclusions: This comparative study demonstrates that the Aspergillus oryzae DNase of the present invention have a superior stability towards proteases compared to Bacillus licheniformis DNase (the mature peptide of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 11 ). Example 12 Stability of Aspergillus oryzae DNase and Bacillus licheniformis DNase, comparative study in the miniLOM assay. In order to compare the storage stability of Bacillus licheniformis DNase and Aspergillus oryzae DNase of the present invention, the storage stability of these two types of DNases was set up in model detergent A and Ariel Actilift Colour&Style. The detergent sample were prepared as described in Example 1 1 and stored for two and four weeks at a constant temperature (-18°C, 35°C). The DNAse dosage in wash liquor was 0.4 ppm. The protease (Savinase, sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 10)) dosage in the wash liquor was 0.15 ppm. After storage, the wash performance was tested in the miniLOM assay (described herein) using polyester Brevundimonas sp. biofilm swatches (prepared as described in Example 11 ). The wash performance is measured as the brightness of the colour of the textile washed. The color difference (L values) was measured using a Color Eye (Macbeth Color Eye 7000 reflectance spectrophotometer). The measurements were made without UV in the incident light and the L value from the CIE Lab color space was extracted.

Example 13 Odor removal by DNase (E-nose) Preparation of DNA swatches with E-2-nonenal Chromosomal DNA from Pseudomonas sp. was isolated by QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit following the manufactures instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Polyester swatches (WFK30A) (2 cm in diameter) were sterilized in a Holm & Halby Systec DB-23 autoclave for 60 minutes at 121 °C. 10ΟμΙ of purified Pseudomonas sp. DNA diluted to a final concentration of 1 ng/μΙ was added on each of the autoclaved swatches and swatches were dried under continuous flow in a Laminar Air Flow Bench for 2 hours. After drying, 10 swatches with DNA were placed in a sterile 25 ml. NUNC tube (364238; Thermo Scientific), and 10 ml of 0.2 mM E-2-Nonenal (255653; Sigma- Aldrich) was added. The tube was placed in a Stuart rotator (20 rpm at room temperature for 20 min). The 10 swatches were transferred to a 50.000 MWCO centrifugal tube (VS203, Vivaspin 20, Satorius). The tubes were centrifuged at 3000 g at 21 °C in 1 min, and the 10 swatches were split into 2 sterile NUNC tubes (364238; Thermo Scientific) with 5 swatches in each tube. Additionally, 5 sterile polyester swatches (WFK30A) (2 cm in diameter) without DNA and E-2-nonenal were added to each of the tubes. The swatches without DNA were marked allowing discrimination from swatches with DNA/ E-2-nonenal. Washing procedure of DNA swatches with E-2-nonenal Wash liquor of Ariel Actilift powder Colour&Style and Ariel Actilift powder were prepared by dissolving 5.0 g of detergent in 1000 ml of sterile MilliQ water with a hardness of 15°dH (EU conditions). Wash liquor of Tide Pods was prepared by dissolving 1.8 g of the white phase detergent in 1000 ml of sterile milliQ water with a hardness of 6°dH. Wash liquors were left on a magnetic stirrer for 20 min prior to use. Wash liquor (10 ml) was added to each of the two identical tubes with 5 DNA swatches with E-2-nonenal and 5 sterile swatches, 10 μΙ of Apergillus oryzae DNAse of the present invention resulting in a final concentration of 5 ppm was added to one of the tubes. The tubes were placed in a Stuart rotor (20 rpm at 30°C for 60 min). Wash liquor was poured off, and swatches were rinsed twice with 20 ml. of sterile milliQ water with hardness 15°dH. Swatches from each tube were transferred to a 50.000 MWCO centrifugal tube (VS203, Vivaspin 20, Satorius) and centrifuged at 3000 g at 21 °C in 1 min. Each swatch with E-2-nonenal was then transferred to a 20 ml. GC headspace vial, using clean, sterile tweezers to place each swatch one swatch in each vial. They were then analyzed in an Alpha MOS HERACLES Flash Gas Chromatography Electronic Nose, equipped with a Restek MXT-5 capillary column, with an HS100 autosampler and an FID detector. Table 12.

Example 14 Odor removal by DNase (Sensory analysis) Polyester and cotton swatches (2 cm in diameter) were soiled with Pseudomonas sp. DNA and 0.5 mM E-2-nonenal (255653; Sigma Aldrich) (see Example 13 for details on prepration of the DNA swatches) and washed in Stuart rotator 60 min at 30°C in model detergent A (prepared by dissolving 3.33 g in 1 liter of milliQ water with hardness 15°dH) in the presence or absence of Apergillus oryzae DNAse of the present invention (5 ppm). After washing, swatches were rinsed twice in 20 ml of MilliQ water with hardness 15°dH. The swatches were evaluated for the perceived intensity of E-2-nonenal by four trained odor panelist (samples where blinded). For evaluation a perceived intensity scale going from 0 to 9 was used. 0 indicated no perceived intensity of E-2- Nonenal, whereas 9 indicated the highest perceived intensity of E-2-Nonenal. Results showed consensus within all four odor panelists. Table 13 DNA-trapped odor on textile can be removed with the Apergillus oryzae DNAse and thus result in odor reduction. Example 15 Assay for visual dertermination of odor removal Brevundimonas sp. was pre-grown on Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) (pH 7.3) (CM0131 ; Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) for 2-5 days at 30°C. From a single colony, a loop-full was transferred to 10 mL of TSB and incubated for 20 hours at 30°C with shaking (240 rpm). After propagation, Brevundimonas sp. was pelleted by centrifugation (Sigma Laboratory Centrifuge 6K15) (3000 g at 21 °C in 7 min) and resuspended in 10 mL of TSB diluted twice with water. Optical density (OD) at 600 nm was measured using a spectophometer (POLARstar Omega (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). Fresh TSB diluted twice with water was inoculated to an OD600nm of 0.03, and 20 mL was added to a petri dish, in which 5 cm x 5 cm swatch of sterile Polyester WFK30A was placed. After incubation (24 h at 15°C with shaking (75 rpm), swatches were rinsed twice with 0.9% (w/v) NaCI. Swatches were washed in TOM either directly after rinsing or after drying for 24 hours in a LAF bench. The visual indicating agent Phenol red in solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 g in 100 ml 99% Ethanol. Indicator solution (50 μΙ_) was added to a filter paper (diameter 2 cm) and dried overnight in fume hood to form an odour capturing agent including the visual indicating agent (Phenol red). Four washed swatches were placed in the bottom of a glass container (one container for each swatch) and 500 μΙ_ of 17% TSB was added. As a control, washed clean textile polyester was placed in the bottom of another glass container and 500 μΙ_ of 17% TSB was added. The containers with the swatches were incubated at incubated at 37°C. The containers were monitored up to 48 hours to detect change of colour of the Phenol red tracer. Table 14. Incubation results Hours in table indicate time points for detected colour change. Example 16 Effect of the presence of DNAse in detergent on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm on textile One strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from laundry was used in the present example. The P. aeruginosa strain was pre-grown on Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) (pH 7.3) (CM0131 ; Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) for 3 days at 30°C. From a single colony, a loop-full was transferred to 10 mL of TSB and incubated overnight at 30°C with shaking (200 rpm). After propagation, the overnight culture was diluted 1000-fold in fresh TSB medium and 1.62 mL of this culture dilution was added into each well of a 12-well polystyrene flat-bottom microplate (3512; Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA), in which round swatches (diameter 2 cm) of sterile Polyester (WFK30A) was placed. After 48 h at 30 °C with shaking (70 rpm), the growth medium was removed, and swatches were rinsed twice with 3 ml. 0.9% (w/v) NaCI. Five rinsed swatches with P. aeruginosa were placed in a 50 ml. test tube and added 10 ml. of Model A liquid detergent prepared in water with hardness 15 °dH with 0.7 g/L pigment soil (Pigmentschmutz 09V, wfk, Krefeld, Germany) and the Aspergillus oryzae DNAse of the present invention (0.1 ppm in wash liquor). As control, a wash without DNase was performed in parallel. Washing was performed in Stuart rotator for 1 hour at 30°C (MiniLOM assay as described herein). Wash liquor was removed, and swatches were rinsed twice with tap water and dried on filter paper overnight. Color difference (L value in the L*a*b color space) was measured using a Minolta CR-300 Chroma Meter head and a Minolta DP-301 Data Processor. The color difference (L value, L*) represents the darkest black at L* = 0, and the brightest white at L* = 100. The results show that the DNAse is able to reduce the stickiness and/or reduce the amount of the P. aeruginosa biofilm on the textile. Table 15. Effect of DNAse in detergent on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm on textile. Example 17 Wash performance of DNAse in the presence of optical brightener Materials and Methods Preparation of biofilm swatches Round swatches (diameter 2 cm) of sterile Polyester WFK30A with Brevundimonas sp. biofilm was prepared as described in Example 4. Washing experiment Wash liquor of Powder Model detergent T without bleach was prepared by dissolving detergent (5.33 g/l) in water with hardness 15°dH. The AEO Biosoft N25-7 (Nl) (0.16 g/l) component of model detergent T was added separately. Pigment soil (Pigmentschmutz, 09V, wfk, Krefeld, Germany) (0.7 g/L) was added to the wash liquor. Wash liquor (10 ml) was added to a 50 ml tube with five rinsed swatches with Brevundimonas sp. and five sterile polyester (WFK30A) swatches. In washes where DNase was included, DNase (0.5 ppm) was added. In washes where optical brightner where included, Tinopal CBS-X (0.1 g/l) was added to the wash liquor. Washing was performed in Stuart rotator for 1 hour at 30°C (MiniLOM assay as described herein). After washing, swatches with Brevundimonas sp. were rinsed twice in tap water and dried on filter paper over night. Color difference (L values) was measured using a Color Eye (Macbeth Color Eye 7000 reflectance spectrophotometer). The measurements were made without UV in the incident light and the L value from the CIE Lab color space was extracted. Table 16. Wash performance of DNAse in the presence of an optical brightener. The data presented in Table 16 demonstrates that the wash performance of the A. oryzae DNase of the present invention is not affected by the presence of an optical brightener. 1.
