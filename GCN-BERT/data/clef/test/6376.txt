Step 2: Preparation of (S)-5-(1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethylamino)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-propyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one
56 mg of (S)-5-(1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethylamino)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-propyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one was prepared as a yellow solid by using 41 mg (0.12 mmol) of 5-chloro-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-propyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one prepared in step 1 according to the same manner as described in step 5 of Example 34 (0.09 mmol, yield: 73%).
