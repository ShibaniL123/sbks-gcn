TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method of preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer by using an aromatic branching agent, and a biodegradable polyester-based polymer prepared by the method. BACKGROUND ART Polyester is a heat-resisting, highly elastic strength synthetic resin with excellent chemical resistance, and is used for reinforced plastics. For example, polyester is widely used for car bodies, bodies of motor boat, and furniture, and also as a fiber material for clothes. From among polyesters, biodegradable polyester-based polymers are polymers that may decompose to water and carbon dioxide, or water and methane gas by microorganisms existing in the nature such as bacteria, algae, and fungi. Such biodegradable polyester-based polymers do not cause environmental pollution and thus are environment-friendly. Biodegradable polyester-based polymers can be produced by a condensation reaction of, for example, diol and diacid. There are various kinds of polyester-based polymers including aliphatic polyester-based copolymers and aromatic polyester-based copolymers as examples of the biodegradable polyester-based polymers. Biodegradable polyester-based polymers can be produced through an esterification reaction and a polycondensation reaction. In the esterification reaction, oligomers are produced by a condensation reaction, and in the condensation reaction, a polymer is produced from the oligomers. In producing biodegradable polyester-based polymers, to shorten a reaction time, various branching agents are usedin a method of preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer. Particularly, isocyanates and other multifunctional acids or alcohols are used as branching agents. Conventional aliphatic branching agents for preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer have a problem in that a yellowness index of polymers obtained by polymerization is high. In addition, conventional methods for preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer have a problem in that the polymerization time is long because branching agents have low reactivity and are not homogeneously dispersed in a reaction mixture.

ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS A method of preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer according to an embodiment of the present invention provides a biodegradable polyester-based polymer having a higher whiteness index and a lower yellowness index than a conventional biodegradable polyester-based polymer. BEST MODE The following is a detailed description of a method of preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer according to an embodiment of the present invention and a biodegradable polyester-based polymer prepared by the method. In the present description, a "branching agent" refers to a material used in a process of preparing a polymer in order to obtain a polymer having a network structure by linking linear oligomers. In the present description, a "dicarboxylic acid compound" refers to a compound containing two carboxyl groups. In the present description, "derivatives of a dicarboxylic acid compound" refer to compounds including all derivatives of a dicarboxylic acid compound such as an ester derivative, an acyl halide derivative, and an anhydride derivative thereof. In the present description, a "diol compound" refers to a compound containing two hydroxyl groups. In the present description, a "tricarboxylic acid compound" refers to a compound containing three carboxyl groups. In the present description, "derivatives of a tricarboxylic acid compound" refer to compounds including all derivatives of a tricarboxylic acid compound such as an ester derivative, an acyl halide derivative, and an anhydride derivative thereof. In the present description, an "extent of reaction" refers to a ratio of an actual polymer yield to a theoretical polymer yield. An "extent of reaction" can be obtained, for example, in case of performing a condensation polymerization of a dicaboxylic acid compound and a diol compound, by measuring a ratio of the actual produced moisture content to the theoretical moisture content which can be produced when the dicaboxylic acid compound and the diol compound are reacted to attain a reaction yield of 100%. According to an aspect of the present invention, a method of preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer includes a prepolymerization step of polymerizing a dicarboxylic acid compound (A), a diol compound (B), and a branching agent (C), which is represented by Formula (1) below, at 160-220°C to produce a prepolymer ; and a condensation polymerization step of performing a condensation polymerization of the prepolymer at 200-250°C, under a vacuum pressure of 0.1 to 2 Torr: In Formula 1, X is selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted C6-C30 arylene group and a substituted or unsubstituted C2-C30 heteroarylene group, wherein X may include at least one -COOR', wherein R' is selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted C1-C20 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C2-C20 alkenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C2-C20 alkynyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6-C30 aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C7-C30 arylalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C2-C30 heteroaryl group, and a substituted or unsubstituted C3-C30 heteroarylakyl group, Y is selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted C1-C30 alkylene group, a substituted or unsubstituted C1-C30 heteroalkylene group, a substituted or unsubstituted C3-C30 cycloalkylene group, a substituted or unsubstituted C3-C30 heterocycloalkylene group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6-C30 arylene group, and a substituted or unsubstituted C2-C30 heteroarylene group, and n is 1 to 100. When a polymerization temperature in the prepolymerization step is lower than 160°C, the reactivity of monomers is low, so that the polymerization time may increase. When a polymerization temperature in the prepolymerization step is higher than 220°C, a thermal decomposition of the prepolymer may occur. When a polymerization temperature of the condensation polymerization step is lower than 200 °C, the reactivity of oligomers is low, so that the polymerization time may increase. When a polymerization temperature of the condensation polymerization step is higher than 250 °C, a thermal decomposition of a produced polymer may occur. When a polymerization pressure of the condensation polymerization step is higher than 2 Torr, the unreacted diol compound that are excessively used and other monomers are hard to be eliminated, so that the polymerization time may increase. In addition, the polymerization pressure in the condensation polymerization step is in reality difficult to be lowered below 0.1 Torr. Specifically, the polymerization pressure in the condensation polymerization may be 0.5 to 1 Torr. The branching agent (C) may increase a whiteness index and decrease a yellowness index of a polymer, which is a final product. Since a material containing an aromatic group is thermally stable more than a material containing an aliphatic group, the material containing an aromatic group may increase a whiteness index and decrease a yellowness index. The branching agent (C) may be produced by carrying out condensation reaction between a tricarboxylic acid compound and a diol compound. For example, the branching agent (C) may be produced by a method including a step of heating a mixture of a tricarboxylic acid compound and a diol compound at 150 to 200°C. In producing the branching agent (C), the amount of the diol compound (B) used may be excessive in comparison with the amount of the tricarboxylic acid compound (A) used. For example, the amount of the diol compound (B) may be 1.0 to 1.3 times, e.g., 1.04 to 1.07 times greater than the amount of tricarboxylic acid (A) compound, in terms of chemical equivalent. A tricarboxylic acid compound used for producing of the branching agent (C) may be a compound that is formed by adding a carboxylic group to a dicarboxylic acid compound. A tricarboxylic acid compound used for producing of the branching agent (C) may include one or more species selected from the group consisting of a trimellitic acid, a trimesic acid, and a trimellitic anhydride. A diol compound used for producing of the branching agent (C) may include one or more species selected from the group consisting of 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 2,3-butanediol, 1,2-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, and 1,4-cyclohexanediol. The amount of the branching agent (C) may be 0.1 to 5 wt% with respect to the total weight of the dicarboxylic acid compound (A) and the diol compound (B). If the amount of the branching agent (C) used is within the range (0.1 to 5 wt%), the production time of a polymer is decreased, and a polymer having a high whiteness index and a low yellowness index can be obtained. The ratio of the amount of the dicarboxylic acid compound (A) used to the amount of the diol compound (B) used may be 1:1 to 1:4, based on the molar ratio. If the ratio of the amount of the dicarboxylic acid compound (A) used to the amount of the diol compound (B) used is within the range (1:1 to 1:4), the extent of reaction may be increased. For example, the amount of the diol compound (B) may be excessive in comparison with the amount of the dicarboxylic acid compound (A). Specifically, the amount of the diol compound (B) used may be 1.0 to 1.3 times, e.g., 1.04 to 1.07 times greater than the amount of dicarboxylic acid compound (A) used, in terms of chemical equivalent. The prepolymerization step may be performed for 70 to 110 minutes. An end point of the prepolymerization step may be determined by measuring the amount of alcohol or water, which is a byproduct of the step. For example, when 1 mol of dimethyl terephthalate, as a dicarboxylic acid compound (A), and 1.3 mol of 1,4-butanediol, as a diol compound (B), are used, if it is assumed that all amount of the used dimethyl terephthalate has reacted with the butanediol, the prepolymerization step may be ended after more than 95% (that is, 1.9 mol) of 2 mol methanol, which is supposed to be produced, is generated as a byproduct. In order to increase a reaction rate by moving a chemical equilibrium in the prepolymerization step, alcohol, water, which are byproducts, and/or an unreacted diol compound may be discharged out of the reaction system by evaporation or distillation. The condensation polymerization step may be performed for 100 to 150 minutes, for example, 110 minutes. The form of the branching agent (C) used to the prepolymerization step is not specifically limited. For example, the branching agent (C) may be used in the prepolymerization step in the form of being dispersed or dissolved in a solvent such as an aliphatic diol having three or more carbons. When the branching agent (C) is dispersed in a solvent such as an aliphatic diol having three or more carbons, as described previously, the branching agent (C) may be dispersed in the solvent at a concentration of about 50 wt% and used as a form of a dispersion. The aliphatic diol having three or more carbons may include one or more species selected from the group consisting of, for example, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 2,3-butanediol, 1,2-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, and 1,4-cyclohexanediol.

At that time, the extent of polymerization reaction was about 82%, the extent of polymerization reaction means a ratio of the actual produced moisture content to the theoretical moisture content which can be produced when the dicaboxylic acid compound and the diol compound are reacted to attain a reaction yield of 100%. As a result, 111 g of an aromatic branching agent were obtained. Then, 111 g of 1,4-butanediol were added to the obtained aromatic branching agent, and a 50 wt% dispersion of an aromatic branching agent was obtained.

At that time, the dispersion was discharged after being stirred until the internal reaction temperature reached 60 °C. Example Example was carried out by the method described below. (Prepolymerization Step) A mixture was prepared by adding 93.21 g (0.48 mol) of dimethyl phthalate, 117.16 g (1.3 mol) of 1,4-butanediol, 0.3 g of tetra-n-butyl titanate and 0.1 g of triphenyl phosphate into a 500 ml three-neck round bottom flask having a Dean-Stark condenser, a nitrogen inlet, and a stirrer.
