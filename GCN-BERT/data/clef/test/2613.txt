Preparation Example 10 Preparation of Compound 10
After completely dissolving Compound B (10.0 g, 16.49 mmol) and 2-bromodibenzo[b,d]furan (3.61 g, 14.99 mmol) in 260 ml of tetrahydrofuran in a 500 ml round bottom flask under nitrogen atmosphere, a 2 M aqueous potassium carbonate solution (130 ml) and then tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0.52 g, 0.45 mmol) were added thereto, and the result was heated and stirred for 3 hours. After lowering the temperature to room temperature, the water layer was removed, and the result was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, vacuum concentrated, and then recrystallized with 330 ml of ethyl acetate to prepare Compound 10 (9.92 g, yield: 86%).
