Example 20: Synthesis of 4-(4-(4-(5-(dimethylamino)pent-1-yn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-N-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanamide
To a solution of 5-(4-(1-(4-(hydroxyamino)-3-methyl-3-(methylsulfonyl)-4-oxobutyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)phenyl)pent-4-yn-1-yl methanesulfonate (Example 19) (120 mg, 1 eq) in THF (3 ml) was added with dimethylamine (1M in THF, 7 ml, 30 eq). The mixture was refluxed for 4 hr and cooled room temperature, and the solvent was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (38 mg, 35%).
