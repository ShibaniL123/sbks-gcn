(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-amino-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5 -difluorophenyl) acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-((diphenylmethylene)amino)-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 92f (1.8 g, 3.037 mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL of methanol. The reaction solution was cooled to 0Â°C, added with 10 mL of 1 M of HCl and stirred for 2 hours. Saturated sodium carbonate solution was added until the pH of the reaction solution was neutral. The reaction solution was extracted with dichloromethane, and the organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-amino-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-y l) -3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 92g (1.2 g, yield 92%) as a light yellow oil.
