N-(1-methyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-6-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)picolinamide (I-9)
A dioxane (4.5 mL) solution of 6-bromo-N-(1-methyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)picolinamide (107.5 mg, 0.3 mmol), (1H-pyrazol-4-yl)boronic acid (50.4 mg, 0.45 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4(34.7 mg, 0.03 mmol), and 2M aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (0.45 mL, 0.9 mmol) was microwaved at 150Â° C. for 45 minutes. Solid was removed by filtration through a celite pad, washing with MeOH. Filtrate was collected, solvent was removed in vacuo, after silica gel chromatography, N-(1-methyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-6-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)picolinamid was obtained as a pale yellow solid: 93.4 mg (90% yield):
