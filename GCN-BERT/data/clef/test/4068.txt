CA 02776331 2012-04-02 WO 2011/063915 PCT/EP2010/007042 LIQUID PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to aqueous liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising almotriptan and particular compounds. Said compositions are stable, thus maintaining the concentrations of almotdptan at constant fixed levels. The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of said compositions and to methods of treatment by administering the compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Migraine is a type of headache, which is a severe, seriously debilitating and usually unilateral form of episodic headache that may be preceded by aura and that is frequently associated with both neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sensitivity to light (photophobia), sound (phonophobia), and smells (osmophobia); sleep disruption, and depression. When untreated, a migraine headache attack may last anywhere from four to 72 hours. Current migraine treatments are classified as prophylactic treatments or as abortive treatments. Each class of treatments is administered to the migraine sufferer based on the frequency and severity of the headache and its associated symptoms. Prophylactic treatments reduce the frequency of migraines and include non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents, andrenergic beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or anticonvulsants. For occasional migraines, abortive treatments are used. The abortive treatments eliminate or reduce the severity of the headache and any associated symptoms after the migraine has begun. Abortive treatments include serotonin receptor agonists or ergotamine-based compounds, or compounds that provide analgesic effects. Almotriptan is a member of a family of tryptamine derivatives ("triptans" or "triptan compounds") typically used as abortive medication in the treatment of acute attacks of migraine and cluster headaches. Generally, their action is attributed to their binding to serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HTID receptors in cranial blood vessels (causing their constriction) and subsequent inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. Orally administered pharmaceutical compositions are provided to the patient in many dosage forms, including solid forms such as capsules (hard or soif) or tablets CA 02776331 2012-04-02 WO 2011/063915 PCT/EP2010/007042 (uncoated or coated), and liquid forms such as solutions, emulsions or suspensions. Pharmaceutical compositions administered in solid form are usually intended to be swallowed whole. Children, the elderly, and many other persons, including disabled or incapacitated patients, often have trouble swallowing tablets or capsules. In these situations, it is desirable to provide the drug either in a chewable solid form or in a liquid form. For many patients, including paediatric and geñatric patients, a liquid oral dosage form is preferable to a chewable dosage form, because of the ease with which it may be swallowed. Additionally, patients may be more inclined to comply with their medication instruction if the dosages are easier to ingest. However, some active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's) like the triptans, e.g. almotriptan, which are unstable in front of light and/or oxidation, are especially unstable and degrade when present in liquid pharmaceutical compositions which need to be stored at long term and in adverse conditions of temperature and humidity, as recommended in the stability guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). Due to this degradation the total amount of almotriptan present in the composition decreases. As a consequence, the patient will receive a lower dose than the one prescribed by the physician. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have now found that liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising almotriptan and certain particular compounds are stable, ensuring thus that the concentration of almoptriptan is maintained constant at the desired levels. The aqueous liquid pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises: a) almotriptan, or a pharmaceutically acceptable sait or hydrate thereof, and b) at least one compound selected from i) 1'-methyI-5-((pyrr idin-1-y su ny )methy )spir [ind ine-3 3'-pyrr idin]-2l and il) 3-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-5-((pyrrolidin-1 -ylsulfonyl)methyl)-I H-indol-2-ol.
