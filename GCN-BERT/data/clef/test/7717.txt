This invention relates to a vascular graft sealed with a biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogel, and a process for the preparation thereof. This invention further relates to a textile vascular graft whose pores are sealed by applying a coating of gelable hydrogel forming material on the surface so that pre-clotting with the blood of the patient can be avoided. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION: The basic function of an artery is transportation of blood from the heart to organs and tissues of the body. When an arterial blood vessel is diseased or becomes dysfunctional, a vascular graft is usually employed to replace or bypass it. The vascular grafts include autologous blood vessel, homograft, cryo-preserved blood vessel, and grafts made of biological material, such as bovine internal mammal artery, human umbilical vein, or pericardium. Grafts are also made of synthetic material such as expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET or polyester). The vascular graft made of synthetic materials is usually porous, compliant, strong, and biocompatible. To maximize the effectiveness of such prosthesis, it should be designed with characteristics which closely resemble that of the natural body lumen which it is repairing or replacing. The ideal graft must minimize blood loss during surgery, have high long term mechanical strength to contain systemic arterial pressure without distending and minimize the cellular inflammatory response. The micrometer sized pores of a synthetic graft provide a good scaffold for cell in-growth from the host so as to accelerate the healing process. A direct correlation between porosity and tissue in-growth has been well established in vascular grafts. The rate of tissue growth is dependent upon graft permeability. Greater tissue in-growth is seen in high-porosity PET compared to e-PTFE. However, PET grafts with a high degree of porosity cause seepage of blood through the grafts to an unacceptably high level. In order to reduce this initial high rate of seepage of blood, grafts are impregnated with the blood of the prospective recipient prior to implantation. Generally, these grafts are immersed in, or flushed with, fresh blood of the patient in order to pre-clot the surfaces of the graft. This initial pre-clotting operation reduces the initial escape of blood through the wall of the graft to an acceptable level while leaving the permeability sufficient to allow tissue growth into the grafts. However, there are limitations to this procedure. They are time consuming and require blood collection from the patient, prior to heparanization of the patient. This method of pre-clotting is not possible in emergency medical situations where the patient has lost a large amount of blood or where time is a critical factor. In addition, such methods cannot be used effectively with patients who are taking anticoagulants. The method presents still another difficulty if the prospective recipient suffers from a blood coagulation defect. A considerable amount of research has centered on developing materials that are initially blood-tight and then gradually become more porous in order to facilitate healing and tissue in-growth into the implanted graft. United States Patent 4,747,848 describes a method of producing a vascular graft which after implantation becomes permeable at a predictable rate by coating with a modified gelatin. In this invention 75% of the amino groups originally present in the gelatin are converted to carboxyl groups by treating it with the anhydride or the chloride of succinic acid. This modified gelatin is mixed with unmodified gelatin, coat the mixture on vascular graft and cross-link amino groups of the gelatin coating first with formaldehyde and then with gluteraldehyde. This process of coating provided controlled degradation of the coated gelatin. In other words, the time for the graft to become fully porous may be controlled by adjusting the ratios of modified and unmodified gelatin in the coating mixture. Duhamel et al. describes a method to seal the pores of vascular graft made of polyester fabric by filling the interstices with a gelable material and cross-linking the gelable material to form uniform gel-coated prostheses having low porosity. The gelable material is a bioerodable polymer selected from the group consisting of polysaccharides, glycosaminoglycans, albumin, gelatin, collagen and fibrinogen and is cross-linked with an agent selected from the group consisting of formaldehydes, dialdehyde starches, carbodiimides and glutaraldehydes. Further details of this method are revealed by them in the United States Patent 5,584,875. Marois et al. (Biomaterials, 1995; 16:1131-1139) compared the performance of a polyester arterial prosthesis impregnated with carbodiimide cross-linked gelatin with that of an uncoated graft using a canine thoraco-abdominal bypass model. The impregnated graft provided satisfactory haemostasis at implantation with no blood permeating through the wall after flow was restored. Biodegradation of the gelatin was complete within 1 month of implantation with the subsequent development of a collagenous internal capsule at both anastomoses. United States Patent 5,843,743 reveals polymeric coatings suitable for several medical applications which include sealing on substrates such as vascular grafts. The coatings are made by addition of free radical polymerizable groups on water soluble macromers selected from polyethylene glycol), polyethylene oxide), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(ethyloxazoline), poly (amino acid), polysaccharide, etc. and polymerizing them under mild conditions to encapsulate the substrates. In United States Patent 5,851,230, inventors describe a coating of heparin-containing collagen sealant suitable for applying on PET vascular graft. The dispersion was prepared at an alkaline pH to allow the addition of heparin without causing the agglutination of collagen from the dispersion. The coating prevents blood loss due to sealing of the pores and release of heparin gave enhanced anti-thrombogenic property after implantation of the prosthesis. In US 6,368,347 and WO/2001/080918, inventors Maini and Kelso describe a coating of bioresorbable hydrogel material made of cross linkable gelatin on the surface of ePTFE vascular graft. The coating minimizes bleeding through suture holes in the ePTFE graft. In United States Patent 6,939,377 Jayaraman and Christoforou describe a method for sealing the pores of a porous PET vascular graft with a proprietary polyurethane polymer Thoralon.Râ„¢. The non-porous coating provides a barrier to prevent short and long term leakage of fluids through the pores of the PET fabric. The coating comprises of polyurethane urea and/or a polyether urethane urea blended with a siloxane containing a surface modifying additive. Keenan describes a method in United States Patent 7,329,531 and W02005/058382 for making a blood-tight vascular graft by sealing of the pores of the graft using sodium alginate. The coating is biocompatible and bioresorbable and applied as a slurry in alcohol-water mixture. The coating sealed the pores of the graft to a value less than about 1.0 ml/ min/cm2. Lee et al. (Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, 1997; 36: 200-208) reported in vitro and in vivo studies of alginate-impregnated graft. Alginate impregnation reduced water permeability of the grafts by >99% rendering the graft impervious to blood. When implanted in the aorta of mongrel dogs and examined after 3 months, it was observed that alginate coating was completely resorbed. In PCT publication WO/2005/ 120462 the inventor describes biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric hydrogel compositions suitable for coating medical devices such as vascular grafts. The hydrogels were based on the mixtures of poly(vinyl alcohol) and polyethylene glycol) macromers. In United States Patent application no. 20060200233 the inventor discloses a highly expanded and porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular graft and making it blood-tight by coating with a reabsorbable sealing material. The sealing material is a biodegradable hydrogel comprised of a mixture of polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide and also contains a therapeutic agent. The hydrogel sealing material provides intemodal sealing during the intraoperative and immediate postoperative time periods. The sealing material also supports transmural tissue growth by degradation of the reabsorable sealant material over time. Therefore, the need exists to provide a vascular graft which has extremely low water-permeability, is non-toxic, hemocompatible and effectively seals the pores of the graft. It gradually degrades away once its purpose is served permitting tissue in-growth through the pores of the fabric graft material. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION: It is therefore an object of this invention is to propose a vascular graft which has resorbable and non-toxic coating on its surface where the coating acts as sealant and this sealant degrades over time when the purpose is served. It is a further object of this invention to propose a vascular graft which avoids blood seepage through its walls. Another object of this invention is to propose a vascular graft which can be prepared by simple techniques. Yet another of this invention is to propose a vascular graft, which is costeffective. These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent to a reader, on ensuing description. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION: According to this invention is provided a vascular graft sealed with biodegradable hydrogel and a process for the preparation thereof. In accordance with this invention, is provided a vascular graft comprising a porous textile tube impregnated with a biodegradable hydrogel. In accordance with this invention is further provided a method for making a vascular graft comprising a porous textile tube that is impregnated with a biodegradable hydrogel. The hydrogel preferably comprises two water soluble materials which mix together to form a gelable solution. The gelable solution is applied to the graft by spray coating or dip coating process and allowed to gel by cross-linking reaction. The resultant vascular graft contained hydrogel within the interstices of the graft and on its surface. Vascular graft made in accordance with the present invention is expected to exhibit uniform low permeability to blood when first implanted into a patient. The hydrogel coating erodes with time thereby leaving a porous fabric tube, which serves as a scaffold for tissue in-growth. The resulting graft is particularly well suited for long-term placement within a patient. Textile grafts are usually made of polyethylene terephthalate fibers and depending on the manufacturing process employed there are woven, non-woven, and knitted grafts. Water permeability is a measure of the functionality of graft which depends on the type namely, woven, nonwoven or knitted. Hydrogels are three dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that can absorb large amount of water without undergoing dissolution due to their cross-linked structure, because of this they have physical characteristic similar to soft tissues. Upon coating on vascular grafts they absorb water, swells and form blood-tight textile tubes. The soft rubbery nature of hydrogel minimizes mechanical and frictional irritation to the blood flows through the graft. In this invention hydrogel was prepared by reacting oxidized alginate with gelatin. Faster gelation could be achieved by the addition of borax. Alginate dialdehyde of 50% oxidation may be obtained dispersing sodium alginate in ethanol, and adding a solution of sodium meta-periodate thereto and stirring well until alginate dialdehyde (ADA) of 50% oxidation is obtained. The reaction mixture is transferred to a dialysis membrane and suspended in distilled water to remove low molecular weight species and unreacted periodate. The dialyzate is freeze dried for hydrogel preparation. This is one component of the hydrogel forming composition. Woven PET graft samples are cleaned and dried for hydrogel coating. 50% oxidized alginate dialdehyde (ADA) and gelatin are dissolved in borax solution and distilled water respectively, to make 1 to 5% solution of each. Immersed vascular graft in ADA solution and dried. Immersed the above in the gelatin solution and dried. This procedure resulted in cross-linking due to the Schiff s base formation between the amino group of lysine or hydroxylysine side group of gelatin and the aldehyde group in ADA. The two step coating process is repeated twice to get uniform coating on the graft surface. Coated grafts were washed and dried. Water permeability tests are conducted and found that water permeability under steady physiological pressure of 120mm of Hg was below 10ml/min/cm2. Woven PET graft samples are cleaned and dried for hydrogel coating. ADA (50% oxidized) is dissolved in distilled water to make 10 to 20% solution. Gelatin is dissolved in distilled water to make a 5 to 15% solution. Both solutions are mixed together and spray coated on the external side of the cleaned PET graft. Coated grafts are washed and dried. Water permeability tests are conducted and found that water permeability under steady physiological pressure of 120mm of Hg was below 5 ml/ min/cm2. The invention will now be explained in greater detail with the help of the following non-limiting examples. Alginate dialdehyde of 50% oxidation may be obtained by the following procedure. Disperse 0.101 mol of sodium alginate (Medium viscosity grade, Aldrich Chemical Company, USA) in ethanol, add 0.0505 mol sodium meta-periodate in distilled water and stir well until alginate dialdehyde (ADA) of 50% oxidation is obtained. Transfer the reaction mixture to a dialysis membrane (Spectra/ porR, USA) and suspend in distilled water to remove low molecular weight species and unreacted periodate. Freeze diy the dialyzate for hydrogel preparation. This is one component of the hydrogel forming composition. EXAMPLE 2 Woven PET graft samples were cleaned and dried for hydrogel coating. Dissolve 50% oxidized alginate dialdehyde (ADA) and gelatin in 0.1M borax solution and distilled water respectively, to make 3% solution of each. Immerse vascular graft in ADA solution for 5 minutes and dried in an oven at 40 - 45Â°C for 20 minutes. Immerse the above in the gelatin solution also for about 5 minutes and dried. This procedure resulted in cross-linking due to the Schiffs base formation between the amino group of lysine or hydroxylysine side group of gelatin and the aldehyde group in ADA. The two step coating process is repeated twice to get uniform coating on the graft surface. Coated grafts were washed thrice with distilled water and dried. Water permeability tests as given in example 4 was conducted and found that water permeability under steady physiological pressure of 120mm of Hg was below 10ml/min/cm2. EXAMPLE 3 Woven PET graft samples were cleaned and dried for hydrogel coating. ADA (50% oxidized) is dissolved in distilled water to make 15% solution. Gelatin is dissolved in distilled water to make a 10% solution. Both solutions were mixed together and spray coated on the external side of the cleaned PET graft. Coated grafts were washed thrice with distilled water and dried. Water permeability tests as given in example 4 conducted and found that water permeability under steady physiological pressure of 120mm of Hg was below 5 ml/min/cm2. The grafts according to the invention were evaluated for their properties. Water permeability tests Water permeability under steady physiological pressure of 120mm of Hg was measured for hydrogel coated and vascular graft at a test temperature 30 Â± 3Â°C. Measurements were done according to the procedure given in the section 4.3. 1.2 of the American National Standard for Vascular Graft Prostheses, ANSI/AAMI VP20-1986. Water permeability of the uncoated vascular grafts was above 450 ml/min/cm2 whereas that of hydrogel coated vascular grafts was under ml/min/cm2. Graft permeability to water was tested under a simulated pressure condition experienced in the body using 200 mm long hydrogel coated graft of diameter 14 mm with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as medium. In this experiment PBS at 37Â°C was pumped through the graft. The graft was subjected to a pulsatile pressure oscillating between and 120mm of Hg to simulate in vivo conditions and at an accelerated test frequency of 3Hz. The graft sample remained intact for 4 days and permeability started increasing. The observed permeability during the first 4 days was under 0.10 pL/min./mm of Hg/cm2. Cytotoxicity tests; In vitro cell culture cytotoxicity test of the hydrogel coated PET grafts was carried out by both direct contact method and test on extract method with a monolayer of L929 mouse fibroblast cells as per 10993-5 standards. Coating on the PET grafts were done using solution of ADA in 0.1M borax and 3% solution of gelatin in distilled water. Samples were found to be non-cytotoxic to fibroblast cells when placed in direct contact and also to the extract of the hydrogel coated graft. Hemocompatibility tests: In vitro hemocompatibility of hydrogel coated PET grafts were tested in comparison with unmodified PET graft samples. In this study, test samples were exposed to whole blood. Hemocompatibility tests were performed according to procedures given in ISO 10993-4:2002(E) - â€˜Selection of tests for interaction of materials with bloodâ€™. Platelet consumption, leukocyte consumption, and hemolysis by the hydrogel coated grafts were found to be substantially lower than the uncoated graft. The vascular grafts produced according to the invention avoid the step of pre-clotting with the blood of the patient prior to implantation. The coating material is a cross-linkable composition comprising of oxidized alginate, gelatin and borax. The gel is non-toxic, hemocompatible and effectively seals the pores of the graft. It gradually degrades away once its purpose is served permitting tissue in-growth through the pores of the fabric graft material. 1.
