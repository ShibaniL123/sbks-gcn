CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of patent application Ser. No. 13/723,372, filed Dec. 21, 2012, entitled “Video and Accessory Apparatus for a Videofluoroscopy Unit” which is based on Provisional Patent Application No. 61/606,724, filed Mar. 5, 2012, entitled “Video and Accessory Apparatus for a Videofluoroscopy Unit” and on which priority of this patent application is based, and which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a videofluoroscopy device. More particularly, it relates to a videofluoroscopy accessory device adapted to securely and removably attach to an X-ray head of a fluoroscopy system or device. 2. Description of Related Art Videofluoroscopy devices are known in the prior art and are most commonly used by doctors and practitioners in the fields of chiropractic, orthopedic, osteopathic and sports medicine. The videofluoroscopy device allows a doctor or practitioner to assess problems or abnormalities of a patient's joints, muscles or bones by recording a real time x-ray image of such joints, muscles, and bones on video tape. The video tape can be reviewed at the doctor's or practitioner's leisure, allowing for careful and precise evaluation of a particular problem which might not be evident from an external exam or from conventional static x-ray photos. Most videofluoroscopy devices are relatively small in design and mount to a wall. The device may be used in an office setting or in a mobile medical vehicle. The videofluoroscopy device mainly consists of a vertical housing enclosing a movement mechanism, the movement mechanism operating a c-arm, the c-arm mounted perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of the vertical housing and supporting an x-ray device. The movement mechanism directs the c-arm upward and downward along the longitudinal axis of the vertical housing. The x-ray device supported upon the c-arm transmits a real time x-ray image to a video tape recorder thereby recording the movement of the entire body of a patient. In particular, the device records x-ray images of the joints, muscles, and bones and their corresponding movements. Although videofluoroscopy devices and systems of the prior art have been successful in rending real time x-ray images of individuals, they do not permit the x-ray viewer to simultaneously view the x-ray and a concurrent video image of the patient and/or the concurrent audio of the patient and/or the videofluoroscopy environment. A need exists for doctors and others to simultaneously view the video x-ray with an external image and sounds of a patient. There is also a need for a videofluoroscopy accessory for accomplishing the above and to allow doctors and others to mount lighting, cameras, microphones, and other medical equipment/tools for optimizing the surgical environment. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Provided herein is a videofluoroscopy accessory device adapted to securely and removably attach to an X-ray head of a fluoroscopy system or device. The videofluoroscopy accessory device on the current invention provides a platform for enhancing and supplementing the surgical environment with additional accessories. The accessories that could be used with the present invention include but are not limited to lights, cameras, microphones, and other medical equipment/tools for optimizing the surgical environment. The present invention can be particularly helpful for allowing for the positioning of a plurality of video cameras around the surgical field when a fluoroscopy system is being used during surgery. This arrangement allows a surgeon or physician to document and/or view a surgical and/or sterile procedure in a hands free manner, thus aiding in maintaining a sterile surgical environment. The height and angle of the accessories, including video cameras, can be adjusted to allow said accessories to move circumferentially around the sterile field while the present invention is mounted on a fluoroscopy system or device. It is envisioned that the present invention in one embodiment may comprise a plurality of video cameras, each positioned to view a different angle of a medical procedure where the plurality of views are shown with a view of an X-ray image or an X-ray video on a common visual display. The arrangement has been found to aid users in viewing and perceiving a multi-dimensional environment. For example, a display showing four videos simultaneously of three video camera views from different angles and an X-ray video of the same subject area, a user could see 360 degrees about the subject area and within the area via the X-ray video. Accordingly, a person skilled in the art should appreciate the advantages of the present invention. In one embodiment the present is a videofluoroscopy accessory for use with a videofluoroscopy device or system, the videofluoroscopy accessory comprises, a clamp adapted to receive an X-ray head of a videofluoroscopy device; at least one accessory mount disposed on the clamp adapted to removably receive at least one predetermined accessory; at least one predetermined accessory; and wherein the at least one predetermined accessory is chosen from a group consisting of a camera, a video camera, a light fixture, a microphone, an image projector, a video projector and an imaging device.
