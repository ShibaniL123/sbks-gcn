A reaction mixture of 1-ethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydrobenzo[cd]indole-6-sulfonyl chloride (100 mg, 0.34 mmol) and 1-(4-(aminomethyl)piperidin-1-yl)ethan-1-one (64 mg, 0.41 mmol) in pyridine (5 mL) was stirred at 80° C. for 1 h. Dilute HCl was added, the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL×3), and the organic layer was washed with water and brine, dried with Na2SO4 and evaporated. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography with petroleum and ether/ethyl acetate (4/1, v/v) to afford N-((1-acetylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)-1-ethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydrobenzo[cd]indole-6-sulfonamide (92 mg, 65%).
