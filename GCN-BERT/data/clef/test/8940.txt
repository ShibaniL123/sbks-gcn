Step 2 Synthesis of compound 54c
To a suspension of the compound 54b (1.21 g, 5.0 mmol) in dichloromethane (12 mL), acetyl chloride (0.428 mL, 6.0 mmol) and pyridine (1.01 mL, 12.5 mmol) were added under ice cooling. Under ice cooling, the mixture was stirred for 1 hour. Then, dilute hydrochloric acid was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by water, an aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate, and brine in this order and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. Diisopropyl ether was added to the residue. The resulting solid was collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure to afford the compound 54c (680 mg, yield 55%) as a white solid.
