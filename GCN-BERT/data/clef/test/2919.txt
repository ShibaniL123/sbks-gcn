Preparation 1: Synthesis of Intermediate 1 {methyl 4-bromo-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate}
Step 1: Synthesis of methyl 2-(methylsulfonyl)propanoate
To a solution of methyl 2-chloropropionate (150 g, 1 eq) in MeOH (500 ml) was added with sodium methanesulfinate (162 g, 1.3 eq) and stirred for 20 hr at 77Â° C. The mixture was cooled down to room temperature and precipitated solid was filtered off through celite. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was suspended in ethyl acetate (100 ml)/hexane (500 ml). After then, the precipitated solid was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to prepare the title compound (162 g, 80%).
