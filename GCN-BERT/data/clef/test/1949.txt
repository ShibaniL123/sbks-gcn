BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Usher Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder and a leading cause of deafness and blindness, is associated with a mutation in any one of ten genes. Other names for the syndrome include Hallgren Syndrome, Usher-Hallgren Syndrome, RP-Dysacusis Syndrome, and Dystrophia Retinae Dysacusis Syndrome. Usher Syndrome is characterized by deafness and gradual vision loss. The hearing loss is associated with inner ear defects, whereas the vision loss is associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degeneration of the retinal cells. Usually, the rod cells of the retina are affected first, leading to early night blindness and the gradual loss of peripheral vision. Some cases involve early degeneration of the cone cells of the macula, leading to a loss of central acuity. In some cases, the sufferer's foveal vision is spared, leading to “doughnut vision,” in which central and peripheral vision remain intact, but interrupted by a ring of blindness. Usher Syndrome has three clinical subtypes, denoted: I, II and III. Usher I subjects are born profoundly deaf, begin to lose vision within ten years and exhibit balance difficulties. They are slow to learn to walk as children, due to vestibular abnormalities. Usher II subjects suffer lesser hearing loss, do not suffer physical imbalance and begin to lose vision in adolescence. Much of their hearing can be preserved into middle age. Usher III subjects suffer gradual loss of hearing and vision and can suffer physical imbalance. Usher Syndrome is a variable condition; the degree of severity is not tightly linked to subtype. For example, an Usher III subject might be asymptomatic in childhood, but develop profound hearing and vision loss by early to mid adulthood. Substantial visual impairment prior to age 50 is common in Usher III subjects. An Usher I subject, on the other hand, might be deaf from birth, but sustain good central vision into old age.

Methods for Making the Pyrazolopyridazine Compounds Non-limiting examples of synthetic schema that are useful for synthesizing the Pyrazolopyridazine compounds include the following. Scheme 1 generally describes the preparation of Pyrazolopyridazine compounds having a 1-N-methyl group and where R′ and R″ are independently an unsubstituted or a substituted phenyl group. For example, a 2-cyanocarbonyl compound in which R′ is unsubstituted or substituted phenyl is condensed with N-methylhydrazine to provide a 3-substituted-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine. The 5-amino group is acylated, for example, with acetic anhydride in the presence of a base, such as pyridine, to provide a 5-amido compound. The 5-amido compound is iodinated, for example, with a mixture of iodine and iodic acid in a solvent such as ethanol (EtOH) to provide an N-(3-substituted-4-iodo-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)acetamide. A palladium-mediated cross-coupling, such as a Sonagashira cross-coupling, of the acetamide with an R″-substituted terminal alkyne, catalyzed, for example, by a palladium complex such as palladium (II) bistriphenylphosphine dichloride in the presence of copper (I) iodide in a solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF) with a base such as triethylamine provides a disubstituted alkyne in which R″ is unsubstituted or substituted phenyl. Saponification of the alkyne acetamide with a base such as sodium hydroxide in a solvent such as ethanol provides the primary amine Diazotization of the primary amine with sodium nitrite in concentrated hydrochloric acid provides a diazo intermediate, which cyclizes to provide a Pyrazolopyridazine compound having a 1-N-methyl group and where R′ and R″ are independently an unsubstituted or a substituted phenyl group. Scheme 2 generally describes the preparation of Pyrazolopyridazine compounds having an R3 group and in which R′ is an unsubstituted or a substituted phenyl group. R′ and R3 can be the same or different. For example, 4,6-dichloro-3-phenylpyridazine is deprotonated with a base such as lithium diisopropyl amide (LDA) in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the resultant 5-lithio species is condensed with an unsubstituted or a substituted benzaldehyde to provide a secondary alcohol. The alcohol is oxidized to a ketone with an oxidizing agent such as manganese dioxide in a solvent such as toluene. The ketone is condensed with an R3-substituted hydrazine in a solvent such as ethanol to provide an intermediate hydrazone, which cyclizes to provide a Pyrazolopyridazine compound having a 1-N—R3 group, in which R3 is defined as in Formulas II and III and in which R′ is an unsubstituted or a substituted phenyl group. Scheme 3 generally describes the preparation of Pyrazolopyridazine compounds having a 1-N-methyl group and where R′ is a cyano group, an alkyne, an alkene or an aryl group. For example, 1-methyl-3-iodophenyl-4-chloro-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridazine is coupled with a suitable coupling partner, such as a cyanide salt, a terminal alkyne, an alkenyl halide, or an aryl halide, optionally in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as a palladium complex, optionally in the presence of a non-palladium transition metal salt such as a zinc or copper salt, optionally in the presence of an additive such as triphenylphosphine or an organic amine base, to provide a Pyrazolopyridazine compound having a 1-N-methyl group and where R′ is a cyano group, an alkyne, an alkene or an aryl group. The position of R′, i.e., ortho, meta or para, in the product is the same as the position of the iodo group in the starting material.

Example 92 Assay Method Showing Activity of Compounds of the Invention that Restore Expression of N48K Clarin-1 Clarin-1 is the protein encoded by the gene mutated in Usher III Syndrome (Adato et al., 2002). The most prevalent mutation in Clarin-1 in North America is N48K, which is reported to cause loss of glycosylation and a trafficking defect (Tian et al., 2009). As a consequence, the N48K protein does not reach the plasma membrane and is degraded by the proteasome. Thus it is believed that restoring the trafficking of N48K Clarin-1 to the cell surface would provide an avenue of intervention for Usher III Syndrome. A useful cellular model to demonstrate the utility of compounds of the invention that restore expression of N48K Clarin-1 is the HEK293-Clarin-1 N48K-HA D9 cell line (Tian et al., 2009). In a typical experiment, these cells are seeded on collagen-coated 96-well plates at a cell density of 20,000 cells per well in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) contain 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator at 37° C., 5% CO2. After an overnight incubation, compounds are added for a 24 hr incubation in DMEM medium contain 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator at 37° C., 5% CO2. As a negative control, DMSO is used at 0.25% final concentrations. Compounds are typically tested in triplicate fashion. After the 24 hr incubation with compounds, the cells are fixed by the addition of 10% buffered formalin to the wells to achieve a final concentration of 4% formalin. After a 20 min fixation at room temperature, wells are washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing Triton X-100 (0.02 phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). The HA-tagged N48K Clarin-1 is detected with an antibody against the HA tag (HA.11 Clone 16B12 Monoclonal antibody, Covance #MMS-101P) at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS containing Triton X-100. After a 90 min incubation, wells are washed three times with PBS containing Triton X-100, and a secondary antibody (Goat anti-mouse IgG-Cy3 (1.5 mg/ml), Jackson IR Europe #115165003) is added to the wells at a dilution of 1:250 in PBS containing Triton X-100 for 45 min. Wells are subsequently washed three times with PBS containing Triton X-100, and a final staining for nuclei is performed by the addition of DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) at a dilution of 1:10,000. The imaging of the stained cells is performed for instance on an InCell 1000 High Content Imager (GE Healthcare), reading out the Cy3 channel for N48K Clarin-1 and the DAPI channel for nuclei. The images are analyzed and quantitated using a specific algorithm. This algorithm measures the HA-Clarin-1 staining for each cell based on the additional nuclear segmentation of the DAPI signal (FIG. 1). This algorithm is preferred as it measures the intensity per cell, and thus it is less sensitive for variation in cell number. Per well, approximately 2,000 cells are measured to achieve an average density per cell measurement. Example 93 IC50 Data for Illustrative Compounds of the Invention IC50 values for activity of illustrative Pyrazolopyrimidine compounds of the invention were obtained according to the assay method of Example 92.

Example 94 Assay Method for Identifying One or More Proteins that Bind the Pyrazolopyrimidine Moiety of Compound 44 Compound 44, which includes a pyrazolopyrimidine moiety and biotin group, is useful as a probe for identifying proteins that bind to its pyrazolopyrimidine moiety. The proteins are identified as follows: HEK293-Clarin-1 N48K-HA D9 cells are seeded on collagen-coated 96-well plates at a cell density of 20,000 cells per well in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator at 37° C., 5% CO2. After an overnight incubation, Compound 44 is added to each well at a concentration of less than or equal to 10 micromolar for a 24 hr incubation. The incubation is optionally performed in triplicate. After the 24 hr incubation with Compound 44, the cells are washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and converted to a cell lysate. The protein bound to Compound 44 is then separated and identified using any suitable method known in the art. For example, the cell lysate is applied to streptavidin-coated beads, and the beads are washed with a buffer containing a detergent, such as sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), to remove any non-specific binding protein. The bound protein is then eluted off the beads with, for example, using 8M guanidine•HCl, pH 1.5, by boiling the beads in SDS-PAGE (-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) buffer, or by a tryptic digest of the beads. The mass of the released peptides can then be measured with a mass spectrometer such as Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) or Electrospray ionization-Time-of-flight (ESI-TOF). These masses are then compared to those of a database containing known protein sequences in order to identify the proteins. The peptide fragments which are bound to Compound 44 are also identified, since the molecular weight of the peptide fragment increases by the molecular weight of Compound 44.
