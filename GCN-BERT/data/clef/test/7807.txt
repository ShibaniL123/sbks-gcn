CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION This application is a continuation of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2014/069584, filed Dec. 10, 2014, titled “Sanitary Lid Assembly for Container and Methods of Producing and Using Same,” which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/914,197, titled “Internally Protected Sanitary Pour Spout for Packaged Liquids,” filed Dec. 10, 2013, and to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/996,979, titled “Internally Enclosed and Sanitary Pour Spout for Packaged Beverages,” filed May 2, 2014, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. FIELD The inventive concept is related to improvements in openings to liquid containers, including aluminum beverage cans. The inventive concept is also related to methods of safely dispensing liquids from containers, including aluminum beverage cans, plastic bottles, paper containers, using a sanitary drinking/pouring apparatus enclosed inside the container. As further disclosed herein, the liquid containers and methods can protect consumers from any exposure to contaminants, including, for example, dust mites, roaches, insects, pesticides, airborne viruses or bacteria, rat urine, and a host of other possible contaminants during transit of the beverage containers or in storage, in stores, or at the consumer's home or business. BACKGROUND A conventional aluminum beverage can 500 is shown in FIGS. 13A-13B. The exterior surfaces of such beverage cans, including the lid 501, are frequently exposed to contaminants during storage and transit between the point of manufacture and the point of sale to a consumer. These contaminants, including rat urine, diseases, bacteria, and the like, can cause serious health problems, including death in rare cases. In view of the increased occurrence of incidents related to contaminated beverage cans, health officials worldwide strongly recommend that consumers thoroughly wash the upper part of beverage cans before drinking from them, as they have most likely been stocked in warehouses and transported straight to the shops without being cleaned. Studies have shown that the tops of beverage cans are more contaminated than public toilets (i.e. full of germs and bacteria). Similar contamination issues exist with other liquid containers, which are subjected to various contaminants during storage and/or transport. With the exception of aluminum cans, virtually all beverage containers can be re-sealed. Because a consumer cannot reseal an aluminum beverage can, the consumer must either consume the entire contents of the aluminum beverage can or throw away (waste) portions of the beverage within the can. This can lead to waste, and it also encourages consumers to consume more soft drinks and other beverages than they otherwise would. Thus, there is a need in the pertinent art for devices and methods that prevent humans from contacting germs, bacteria, and other contaminants during consumption of canned beverages. There is a further need in the pertinent art for devices and methods that permit resealing of beverage cans. SUMMARY Described herein, in one aspect, is a lid assembly for sealingly closing an interior of a container. The interior of the container can be configured to receive a liquid substance. The lid assembly can have a lid and a collapsible funnel. The lid can have an inner surface and an outer surface. The lid can define a hinge, an opening extending from the inner surface of the lid to the outer surface of the lid, and a sealing element. The sealing element can be configured for pivotal movement relative to the hinge about and between an open position and a closed position. The opening of the lid can have a central axis. The collapsible funnel can define a spout and be operatively coupled to the lid. The collapsible funnel can be maintained in a compressed state when the sealing element of the lid is in the closed position, and the collapsible funnel can be biased toward an expanded position. When the sealing element of the lid is moved from the closed position to the open position, the collapsible funnel can be configured to move from the compressed state to the expanded state. In the expanded state, the collapsible funnel can extend outwardly from the outer surface of the lid relative to the central axis of the opening of the lid. In another aspect, described herein is a container for receiving a liquid substance. The container can have a container body and a lid assembly. The container body can define an interior that is configured to receive the liquid substance. The lid assembly can sealingly close the interior of the container body. The lid assembly can have a lid and a collapsible funnel. The lid can have an inner surface, an outer surface, and a peripheral edge secured to the container body. The lid can define a hinge, an opening extending from the inner surface of the lid to the outer surface of the lid, and a sealing element. The sealing element can be configured for pivotal movement relative to the hinge about and between an open position and a closed position. The opening of the lid can have a central axis and be positioned in fluid communication with the interior of the container body. The collapsible funnel can define a spout and be operatively coupled to the lid. The collapsible funnel can be maintained in a compressed state when the sealing element of the lid is in the closed position, and the collapsible funnel can be biased toward an expanded position. When the sealing element of the lid is moved from the closed position to the open position, the collapsible funnel can be configured to move from the compressed state to the expanded state. In the expanded state, the collapsible funnel can extend outwardly from the outer surface of the lid relative to the central axis of the opening of the lid. In another aspect, described herein is a method of forming a container as disclosed herein. The method of forming the container can include securing a lid assembly as disclosed herein to a container body as disclosed herein to sealingly close an interior of a container body. Described herein, in a further aspect, is a method of dispensing a liquid from a container as disclosed herein. The method of dispensing the liquid from the container can include moving the sealing element from the closed position to the open position to move the collapsible funnel of the container from the compressed state to the expanded state. In the expanded state, the collapsible funnel can extend outwardly from the outer surface of the lid relative to the central axis of the opening of the lid. The method can also include selectively positioning the container to dispense liquid through the spout of the collapsible funnel. Optionally, the method can also include moving the sealing element of the lid from the open position to the closed position to re-close the interior of the container. When the sealing element of the lid is moved from the open position to the closed position, the collapsible funnel can move from the expanded state to the compressed state, and the sealing element can sealingly close the interior of the container.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description, examples, drawings, and claims, and their previous and following description. However, before the present devices, systems, and/or methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the specific devices, systems, and/or methods disclosed unless otherwise specified, as such can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. The following description of the invention is provided as an enabling teaching of the invention in its best, currently known embodiment. To this end, those skilled in the relevant art will recognize and appreciate that many changes can be made to the various aspects of the invention described herein, while still obtaining the beneficial results of the present invention. It will also be apparent that some of the desired benefits of the present invention can be obtained by selecting some of the features of the present invention without utilizing other features. Accordingly, those who work in the art will recognize that many modifications and adaptations to the present invention are possible and can even be desirable in certain circumstances and are a part of the present invention. Thus, the following description is provided as illustrative of the principles of the present invention and not in limitation thereof. As used throughout, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a projection” can include two or more such projections unless the context indicates otherwise. Ranges can be expressed herein as from “about” one particular value, and/or to “about” another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular value forms another aspect. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. As used herein, the terms “optional” or “optionally” mean that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. As used herein, the teres “opening” and “aperture” can be used interchangeably. The word “or” as used herein means any one member of a particular list and also includes any combination of members of that list. As used herein, the term “sealingly” refers to the engagement or connection between two components to form a seal. Although components may be sealingly connected or engaged when operatively assembled or positioned, the components may be separated and then reattached to again form a seal. In exemplary aspects, as further disclosed herein, the seal that is formed between two components can be substantially fluid-tight. A primary objective of the disclosed lid assemblies is to protect consumers from contaminants, germs or other harmful organisms when consuming a liquid contained in a typical “easy-opening” container. These contaminants can easily contact portions of the easy opening container, which, in turn, can come into contact with a user's mouth. The disclosed hinged lid assemblies can be used to effect closing and opening of an aperture integral to a container of a liquid, including consumable consumer beverages, soups, and the like. In exemplary aspects, as further disclosed herein, the lid assemblies can be used with aluminum beverage cans as are known in the art However, it is contemplated that the disclosed lid assemblies are also suitable for other types of containers of liquids, which can be constructed from a wide variety of conventional materials. In operation, it is contemplated that the disclosed lid assemblies can be re-closed and re-sealed in a manner that prevents spillage or leakage of the contained liquid while maintaining the sanitary condition of the lid assemblies. As further disclosed herein, the lid assemblies can comprise a compressed, expandable funnel that is immersed within the container (optionally, immersed within the contained liquid) in direct proximity to an aperture of the lid of the container. The funnel can be attached to either the exterior or interior surface of the container, or to a structural member of the overall hinge mechanism. The re-sealable lid assemblies as disclosed herein can provide great benefits to end users and manufacturers alike, and cut down on waste and environmental pollution. As one will appreciate, in today's marketplace, almost all plastic bottles and other containers are re-sealable. Among conventional beverage containers, only the aluminum can generally has no re-sealing mechanism. As further disclosed herein, the funnel can be securely retained within the container by means of a protective cover that functions as a retractable, hygienically-sealed mechanism. The hygienically-sealed mechanism can take the form of a sealing element, such as, for example and without limitation, an integral, pre-cut hinged aluminum seal, or a two-part, snap-cover having a cap-like structure. The sealing element can be integral to the outer surface of the container of the liquid. It is contemplated that the disclosed lid assemblies can serve as an improvement to openings in primarily aluminum beverage cans and permitting safer drinking and/or pouring liquids from aluminum beverage cans, plastic bottles, paper containers, and the like. It is further contemplated that the disclosed lid assemblies can permit re-sealing of the container after the container has been opened, thereby further protecting the contents of the container from exposure to contaminants while preserving carbonation within the contained liquid. Because the pouring drinking apparatus is positioned within the container, a user can be protected from any exposure to contaminants, including, for example and without limitation, dust mites, roaches, insects, pesticides, airborne viruses, bacteria, rat urine, and a host of other possible contaminants. As one will appreciate, the container can be exposed to contaminants during bottling/filling operations, during transit of the beverage containers, during storage, in retail stores, at the consumer's home or business, or at any time prior to consumption of the beverage/liquid. As further disclosed herein, the lid assembly can comprise a hinged closing mechanism that can be opened to cause an outward expansion of the funnel which then projects outwardly through the opening of the lid. The closing mechanism can be re-closed by the exertion of slight finger pressure to reseat the funnel, protect any residual liquid within the container, and preserve carbonation within the beverage, if such exists. It is contemplated that the disclosed lid assembly can permit comfortable, sanitary drinking or pouring of the content of the container through the funnel, without contact of the user's lips or tongue with any portion of the exterior surfaces of the lid. Additionally, during use, it is contemplated that the liquid contents of the container will never be in contact with any portion of the exterior of the can. FIG. 1 shows the protective sealed mechanism comprising an oval-shaped seal integral to the lid of a can. The seal has an attached pull tab which, when pulled, releases the seal along its lightly pre-cut etched perimeter on the lid surface and creates an opening, with a hinge connecting the rear portion of the oval-shaped seal to the top surface of the lid. Upon the oval-shaped seal being opened, an interiorly-stored expandable funnel simultaneously expands outward through the opening. FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view as seen from section line 1-1. Similarly, beginning with FIGS. 9-10B, there is illustrated a protective cover having a two-part cap-like structure, comprising an outer cap and a corresponding inner cap. The outer cap and the inner cap can be integrally affixed to each other by a common hinge at the rearmost sections of these two components. The outer cap manifests a forward-placed anvil, or grip, suitable for a user to grasp and pull upward, thereby forcing the outer cap from its bond with the inner cap. The upward pulling of the cap then exposes an aperture, through which the interior expandable funnel simultaneously projects outward and is exposed atop the aperture. For the sake of convenience and ease of illustration, the lid assemblies disclosed herein are described as being a component of a common aluminum beverage can 24, whether the lid 1 is crimped to the top of a can or otherwise attached. By way of clarification, the can 24 is also referenced having a front can round 20 and a rear can round 21. The lies assembly can comprise a funnel 30 attached to the can 24 or other container, such that when the seal 11 or snap-cover 50 is fully closed, the funnel 30 is interiorly stored within the container, creating an outwardly directed tension loading. Upon opening of the seal 11 or snap-cover 50, the funnel 30 springs outwardly from the surface of the container. It is to be understood that the inventive concept presented herein may easily be utilized on a great variety of liquid containers and/or packages of any shape or profile and manufactured from a variety of materials, including metal, cardboard, plastic, glass, or other substances. In exemplary aspects, it is contemplated that the disclosed lid assemblies can serve as a means whereby a user may drink the contents of a beverage can 24 or other container without the user's lips or tongue coming into contact with the exterior surfaces of the can or container's lid 1. In the event of partial or repetitive pouring or drinking from a can 24 featuring the embodiments herein, a user can also re-seal the opening if desired. In the embodiment featuring an integral metal seal 11 (FIGS. 1-7B), it is contemplated that the seal 11 can be re-closed by exerting finger pressure in the direction opposite to opening, thereby causing the seal 11 to rotate about a living hinge 16 and seat itself underneath semi-rigid flaps 32 surrounding an opening perimeter 17. It is further contemplated that the disclosed lid assemblies can permit comfortable drinking of the content of the can 24 through the exposed funnel 30 and can enhance the health and safety of a user. It is still further contemplated that the snap-cover 50 embodiment (shown in FIGS. 9-12) can be re-closed by finger pressure downward against the top surface of an outer cap 53, thereby forcing the outer cap 53 to become tightly juxtaposed against an inner cap 52. FIG. 7A presents the overall concept of one embodiment of the lid assembly. Illustrated in FIG. 7A is a common aluminum beverage can 24 shown with an expandable funnel 30 exposed immediately after opening the can 24 by means of the seal 11. The funnel 30 can be used as both a pouring spout 33 and a means for direct drinking of a beverage contained in the can 24. The seal 11, which is initially bound in a closed position, in communication with the lid outer surface 3 of the can 21, is shown fully open. The seal 11 can be forced into the open position by means of a pull tab 40 (out of view). The seal 11 can be fabricated with light scoring lines 14 to facilitate bending of the seal 11 toward the lid outer surface 3. Prior to opening of the seal 11 the funnel 30 can be compacted and stowed directly below and abutting the inner surface 12 of the seal 11. In this manner, the funnel 30 can be continuously immersed, to some degree, within the interior of the can 24. The funnel 30 can thereby be protected from dirt, bacteria, and other contaminants that may come in contact with the outer surface 3 of the lid 1 or can 24 during shipping and/or storage. It is contemplated that the funnel 30 can comprise any material that has elastomeric qualities, such as, for example and without limitation, silicon, rubber, polyvinyl, or various grades of plastic-type compositions. Other embodiments of the funnel 30 can be constructed from bendable aluminum or other lightweight, flexible materials. A discussion of other details of the lid assembly is continued with reference to FIG. 1, which depicts a direct overhead view of the lid 1, which has been crimped or otherwise attached to the upper rim of an aluminum can, with the front round 20 and the rear round 21 of the can being shown. FIG. 1 shows the seal 11 of the lid 1 in a closed configuration in which the outer perimeter 15 of the seal 11 abuts or is otherwise in communication with the lid 1. The fully-opened profile of the lid 1 can be defined by pre-cut scoring around the opening perimeter 17 of the lid 1, which also defines the seal perimeter 15. To initiate opening of the seal 11, provision is made for a pull tab 40 which can optionally be permanently affixed to the seal 11 by means of a small rivet 43. To open the can 20, 21 and gain access to the contained liquid, a user can position his/her finger within the circumference of the ring 41 of the pull tab 40 and simultaneously pull upward and inward, toward the center of the lid 1. This pulling action can cause rotation of the seal 11 about a lightly-scored living hinge 16, which can be formed by the intersection of the back of the seal 11 and the outer surface 3 of the lid 1. It is contemplated that a circular cavity 42, of approximately one-sixteenth to one-eighth inch in depth, can be machined into the center of the seal 11. A correspondingly-dimensioned latching stub 5 can be machined so as to protrude (optionally by about one-sixteenth to about one-eighth inch) above the outer surface 3 of the lid 1 (shown in FIG. 2). The act of pulling the ring 41 of the tab 40 can bring the seal 11 toward the latching stub 5, which can allow the user to press the inner surface 12 of the seal 11 and subsequently force the cavity 42 to affix itself to the latching stub 5, if desired. Optionally, in an alternative embodiment, it is contemplated that the relative positions of the cavity 42 and the latching stub 5 can be interchanged. FIG. 2 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the flat segment only of the lid 1 as shown from section lines 1-1. FIG. 1 depicts the lid inner surface 2, the lid outer surface 3, and the latching stub 5. Further shown in FIG. 2, is a mounting base 4, which can provide a means for retention and/or adhesion of the bottommost part of the funnel 30, whether the funnel 30 is in its compressed state 35 or the funnel's expanded state. The pull tab 40 is shown in its parallel, undisturbed configuration, being securely attached to the lid 1 by means of the rivet 43. In FIG. 3 there is shown the underside of the lid 1, as would be viewed from the interior of the can 24. FIG. 3 is drafted with the deletion of the funnel 30, so as to simplify and clarify the relationship of the components shown. The mounting base 4, in certain embodiments, can optionally serve as the location of the means for attaching the base of the funnel 30 to the lid inner surface 2. The mounting base 4 can optionally have a layer of adhesive 8 (shown by cross-hatching) for attachment of the widest section of the funnel 30 to either the outer surface 3 or the interior surface 2 of the lid 1. It is contemplated that the mounting base 4 can comprise other types of fastening mechanisms to hold the base of the funnel 30 in place. Shown in both FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 is a tightly fitting series of elastomeric flaps 32 attached to the inner perimeter of the mounting base 4. The flaps 32 can be constructed in a pattern so as to encompass a portion of the outer perimeter 15 of the seal 11. The flaps 32 can comprise an elastomeric material, and they can be configured to retain the outer perimeter 15 of the seal 11 just below the outer surface 3 of the lid 1 should a user choose to re-close the funnel 30 and the seal 11 after opening the can 24. FIG. 4 depicts a side view of the configuration of the inverted lid 1 shown in FIG. 3, again showing the mounting base 4, the lid interior surface 2, the lid outer surface 3, and the latching stub 5. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 713, the mounting base 4 can comprise upper and lower flanges 6, 7, which function to retain the funnel 30 by means of a protruding ring around the interior surface of the bottommost part of a different embodiment of the funnel 30. Various other means of retention of the funnel 30 to the mounting base 4 can be utilized, such as, for example and without limitation, an expandable O-ring, mechanical latches, uni-body construction, an exterior groove corresponding to the inner perimeter 17 of the aperture, and gripping mechanisms. FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view, in the direction of the section line 5-5 of FIG. 6. FIG. 5 depicts a cross-sectional view of the embodiment containing the retractable seal 11 wherein the seal 11 is bent fully toward the outer surface 3 of the lid such that the seal cavity 42 may engage the corresponding latching stub 5 and hold the seal 11 in the fully open position. Optionally, a carburetor 37, piercing an area between two adjacent ridges 34 of the funnel 30, can permit entry of air into the funnel 30 when in use, thereby preventing a vacuum buildup within the interior of the can 20, 21. In FIG. 6, there is illustrated a direct overhead view of the top of the lid 1, fitted to a can 20, 21 which has been fully opened, exposing the inner surface 12 of the seal 11. As shown, the seal 11 has been pulled open and retracted at the living hinge 16. The seal 11 can optionally be fabricated with light scoring 14 so as to make it easier for a user to bend the seal 11 back toward the outer surface 3 of the lid 1. The retraction of the seal 11 can allow the previously compressed funnel 30 to expand and protrude upward a distance suitable for comfortable drinking by a user. The pouring spout 33 can be exposed and accessible so as to avoid contact of the user's lips or tongue with any portion of the exterior surfaces of the lid 1, the tab 40, or the seal 11. The carburetor 37 is also shown, as well as the spout 33 of the funnel. FIG. 6 demonstrates the result of the restrained tension of the stored funnel 30 being released by the opening of the seal 11, which causes the stored funnel 30 to project upward and outward, thereby forcing the small flaps 32 to extend vertically upward around the opening perimeter 17 adjacent to the base of the funnel 30. Should a user decide to re-close the seal 11 and retain the beverage or fluid in the can 24 for later use, the seal 11 can be released from the latching tab 5 and rotated about the living hinge 16 toward the funnel 30. By continuing to place slight pressure on the outer surface of the seal 11, the user can then force the funnel 30 inwardly toward the previous funnel compressed state. To complete the closing process, slightly more finger pressure can cause the seal perimeter 15 to first displace the perimetral flaps 32 downward and afterwards, the elastomeric flaps 32 will spring upward to fit tightly over the seal perimeter 15, thereby protecting the contents from spillage and airborne contaminants. In exemplary aspects, the lid assembly can comprise a snap-lid 10, depicted in FIG. 9, which is an overhead view of the snap-lid 10, showing the snap-cover 50 in its sealed or closed position. The snap-lid 10 can be a ready-to-install aluminum beverage (or other liquid) can lid which can be crimped or otherwise attached to the top rim 60 of a beverage can 20, 21 in the assembly, filling, and packaging stages of a cannery operation. The snap-lid 10 is displayed with its outer cap 53 closed, prior to initial opening, or after re-sealing by a user. The outer cap 53 can be snapped into a snug, leak-proof fit against the outer perimeter of the hidden inner cap 52, which is indicated by dashed lines. A grip 51, having dimensions suitable for grasping by a user's thumb and forefinger, can be an integral part of the outer cap 53 of the snap cover 50 mechanism. The outer cap 53 left ledge 54 and right ledge 55 can provide a protective overlay for placement of a strip of self-bonding liner, sealing gasket, pressure-sensitive tape, or other material which can be used to hygienically seal the snap cover 50 during shipment and storage of the container, prior to opening by a user. It is contemplated that other sealing options can be used, such as, for example and without limitation, a liner tightly attached to the outer perimeter of the left inner wall 58 and right inner wall 59 of the inner cap at the time of fabrication and closing of the outer cap 53 onto the inner cap 52. FIG. 10A illustrates a side view of the beverage can 20, 21 and snap cover 50 depicted in FIG. 9 of the snap-lid 10 embodiment. FIG. 10A further shows a protective liner 63 that can be tightly wound about a rear base 73 and front base 74 of the snap cover 50. The protective liner 63 can also cover the left outer wall 56 and the right outer wall 57 of the outer cap 53, both these walls 56, 57 being more clearly illustrated in FIG. 11. The protective liner 63 can be released from its seating about the outer cap 53 by a user grasping and pulling a protruding tab 64, which can be an integral part of the protective liner 63. Immediately afterwards, the user can grasp the grip 51 in order to force the outer cover 53 upwards and rotate the outer cover 53 about the hinge point 61. FIG. 10A provides a segmented view of the interior of the beverage can 24, which view reveals the funnel 30 in its compressed state 35. The bottommost section of the funnel 30 can be bonded to the inner surface 2 of the beverage can 24 or attached to the inner or outer surface of the beverage can 24 by any variety of fastening means compatible with the type of beverage contained within the can. The rear base 73, which can support the hinge 61, is also shown. The hinge 61 can be a living hinge, comprising the same material as the outer cap 53, or a separate hinge mechanism of independent design. As stated earlier, to open the snap-lid 10 embodiment, it is contemplated that a user need only grasp the grip 51 and pull upward from the lid outer surface 3. In FIG. 10A and FIG. 10B, it is to be noted that item #62 represents a variable dimension indicating a range of diameters to which the outer cap 53 can be constructed, thereby allowing installation of varying sizes of funnels 30. The dimension line 62 is limited by consideration of the shape and size of the bottom surface of the beverage can 24, since uniformly-sized beverage cans are frequently stacked atop each other in bound groupings (e.g. groups of six or twelve) for ease and compactness of storage. The outer cap 53 can also be of a convex profile to further enhance the vertical stacking of uniformly-sized beverage cans atop each other. FIG. 10B illustrates a cross-sectional view of the snap-lid 10, further showing the outer cap 53, the inner cap 52, and the funnel 30 in its compressed configuration 35 inside a typical beverage can 24, all as seen from section line 9-9. Again, the dimension line 62 indicates a range of diameters to which the outer cap 53 can optionally be constructed, to permit the installation of varying sizes of funnels 30. FIG. 11 presents an overhead view which further explains the configuration of the snap-lid 10 embodiment immediately after the snap-cover 50 is opened by a user. To initiate the opening, the grip 51 is used to forcefully pry the left inner wall 56 and the right inner wall 57 comprising the perimeter walls of the snap-cover 50 from their juxtaposition against the outer walls 58, 59 of the inner cap 52. The prying action can also free the outer cap 53 from its seal against the inner cap 52. Thereupon the outer cap 53 can be further rotated about the living hinge 61 to thereby release the funnel 30 to expand outwardly from the lid surface 3. During the process of opening, it is also necessary to break any bond existing pursuant to any self-bonding liner, sealing gasket, pressure-sensitive tape or other means to seal the outer cap 53 and inner cap 52 (shown previously in FIG. 10A). The means for hermetically sealing the outer cap 53 and the inner cap 52 can be arranged in a variety of ways, including application of the sealing device to the left outer wall 58 and the right outer wall 59, or to the cover left ledge 54, and cover right ledge 55 of the snap cover 50. FIG. 11 also shows the funnel 30 in its vertically-outward expanded position, along with the pouring, or drinking, spout 33. A carburetor 37, or venturi opening, can be utilized to allow exterior air to freely flow into the interior of the can 20 as the liquid contents are emptied by means of the spout 33. In use, it is contemplated that a user of the snap lid 10 sealing mechanism can re-close the snap lid 10 to conserve any remaining liquid, or merely as a continued protection of the funnel 30 from contact with airborne germs or micro-organisms. To close the snap cover 50, the user can press against the outer surface of the outer cover 53 to cause rotation about the hinge 61 in the direction of the funnel 30. In this manner, the outer cap 53 can engage the funnel 30 in the vicinity of the spout 33, pressing the funnel 30 downward below the outer surface 3 of the snap-lid 10. Simultaneously, the inner perimeter of the outer cap 53 can make contact with the outer perimeter of the inner cap 52. Also, the inner walls 56, 57 of the outer cap 53 can tightly engage the outer walls 58, 59 of the inner cap 52, increasing the security of the closing arrangement. Further pressing of the outer cap 53 can again establish a tightly fitting seal, thereby preventing inadvertent spills of the remaining liquid contents, while also providing hygienic protection of the funnel 30 and the inner cap 52 until the next occasion for pouring or drinking of the beverage can 20 contents. FIG. 12 presents a cross-sectional view, as seen from section line 11 of the snap-lid 10 and its snap-cover 50 in the open position, with the funnel 30 expanded upward from its base 31 to the pouring or drinking configuration. The size and dimensions of the funnel 30 can be significantly increased, at a manufacturer's discretion, and in correspondence to the size of the can or other container utilizing the snap-lid 10 embodiment.
