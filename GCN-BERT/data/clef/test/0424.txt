Preparation of 2-chloro-N-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-5-nitrobenzamide (C386)
To a solution of 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzoic acid (0.7 g, 3.5 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) were added sequentially 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate (HATU; 4.0 g, 10.4 mmol), diisopropylethylamine (3 mL, 17.36 mmol) and 2,2-difluoropropan-1-amine (0.5 g, 3.8 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water and was extracted with dichloromethane (2Ã—20 mL). The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography (silica gel 100-200 mesh) eluting with 40-50% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether afforded the title compound as an off-white solid (0.9 g, 93%):
