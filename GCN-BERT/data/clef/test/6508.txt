FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel use of an urushiol compound isolated from Resina Toxicodendri, and in particular, to a use of an urushiol compound in preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for inhibiting Smad3 phosphorylation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Natural pharmaceuticals play an important role in the research of the field of medical care and pharmaceutical research. It is shown that 80% of antimicrobial drugs and 60% anticancer drugs originate directly or indirectly from natural products (J Nat Prod, 2003, 66: 1022-1237). Resina Toxicodendri is the dried resin secreted by Toxicodendron vernicifluum and has been used as an anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring agent in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Chinese patent application no. 201010149042.3, titled “Urushiol compound and medicinal composition thereof, preparation method and application” thereof, filed on Apr. 16, 2010, published on Aug. 18, 2010 with publication no. CN101805246A, granted on Jun. 5, 2013, disclosed that the researchers of Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Kunming, China) isolated and purified an urushiol compound with the following structural formula: The above urushiol compound is marked with a code GQ-5. GQ-5 is a small molecular urushiol compound with a molecular formula, C21H34O2. The compound preparation formed by the urushiol compound has obvious effects of inhibiting tumor cytotoxin activity and tumor angiogenesis. Inventors of the present invention, from Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China) continue the research of the phenolic component GQ-5 has effective of inhibiting fibrosis of liver tissue and kidney tissue. They filed the following two Chinese patent applications: CN 201010149042.3, titled “Use of an urushiol compound in preparation of drug for inhibiting fibrosis of liver tissue”, filed on Apr. 17, 2012, published on Oct. 30, 2013 with publication no. CN103371986A; CN 201210111642.X, titled “Use of an urushiol compound in preparation of drug for inhibiting fibrosis of kidney tissue”, filed on Apr. 17, 2012, published on Oct. 30, 2013 with publication no. CN103371987A. All patents, patent publications, and non-patent publications cited are incorporated by reference herein. TGF-β1 signals are transduced by transmembrane serinethreonine kinase receptors type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) and intracellular mediators known as Smads. Upon TGF-β1 stimulation, Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by TβRI. Phosphorylated Smadsheteroligomerize with the common partner Smad4 and then translocate into the nucleus, where they control the transcription of TGF-β-responsive genes through interaction with specific cis-acting elements in the regulatory regions. Although both Smad2 and Smad3 are strongly activated in various experimental and human fibrotic kidney diseases, it is now well recognized that Smad3 is the key mediator of TGF-β1-induced ECM production and tissue fibrosis. Deletion of Smad3 suppresses fibrogenesis in a number of rodent models, including diabetic nephropathy, obstructive nephropathy, and drug toxicity-related nephropathy. On the other hand, conditional knocking out of Smad2 from kidney tubular cells significantly enhanced renal fibrosis via up-regulation of Smad3 signaling. These findings indicate that Smad3 expression and/or phosphorylation might be a potential target for the intervention of renal fibrosis. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide a novel use of an urushiol compound, coded as GQ-5, isolated from Resina Toxicodendri. The present invention provides a use of an urushiol compound GQ-5 in preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for inhibiting Smad3 phosphorylation. In the present invention, inventors continue the research of the component of Resina Toxicodendri GQ-5, and demonstrate that treatment with GQ-5 significantly inhibited the progression of interstitial fibrosis in the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model. We further demonstrate that the anti-fibrotic effect of GQ-5 might be mediated by selective inhibition of TGF-β1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation. In accordance with the present invention, the urushiol compound is isolated from Resina Toxicodendri. In accordance with the present invention, the structural formula of the phenolic compound is: The results of experiments of the present invention verify that the urushiol compound GQ-5 inhibited the interaction of Smad3 with TβRI, inhibited subsequent phosphorylation of Smad3, reduced nuclear translocation of Smads complex, and suppressed the transcription of major fibrotic genes such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen I and fibronectin. Therefore, GQ-5 could be a potent and selective inhibitor of TGF-β1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation, and be used to prepare pharmaceutical compositions for inhibiting Smad3 phosphorylation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A further illustration of the invention may be described with reference to the following examples. Example 1 Preparation of the Urushiol Compound GQ-5 To isolate GQ-5, the dried resins of Toxicodendron vernicifluum (17 kg) (Yunnan Corporation of MateriaMedica, Kunming, P. R. China) were extracted with 80% ethanol (3×20 L) at room temperature. The extracts were concentrated under reduced pressure, and suspended in water followed by partition with ethyl acetate (3×5 L). The extract (220 g) from ethyl acetate was submitted to a silica gel column (200-300 mesh, 12×150 cm, 2.5 kg, Qingdao Marine Chemical Inc., Qingdao, P.R. China), eluted with a gradient of CHCl3MeOH (100:0-80:20) to yield 10 fractions. The fraction 4 (15 g) was subjected to a MCI gel CHP 20P column (75-150 μm, Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan), eluted with gradient aqueous acetone (80:20-100:0) to yield fractions 4.1 and 4.2. Among them, the fraction 4.2 (11.3 g) was filtrated on Sephadex LH-20 (CHCl3MeOH, 6:4, Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) to yield GQ-5 (10 g). Example 2 Identification of the Urushiol Compound GQ-5 The spectroscopic and chemical methods were used to identify the structure of GQ-5. The 1H NMR spectrum using Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) indicated the diagnostic signals of one 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene group, one methyl, and one aliphatic chain. The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra revealed one methyl, five methine, and three quaternary carbons (two of them are oxygenated). Mass spectra (ESI-MS) (API QSTAR Pulsar 1 spectrometer, AB SCIEX, USA) and high resolution ELMS (AutospecPrimier P776 instrument, Waters, USA) analyses indicated that the molecular formula of GQ-5 was C21H34O2. The NMR data of GQ-5 were in agreement with those of 3-[(Z)-pentadec-8-enyl]catechol. In addition, the position and geometry of the double bond in the side chain was confirmed by total chemical synthesis. Example 3 The Purity Determination of the Urushiol Compound GQ-5 The purity of GQ-5 was determined by analytic HPLC using RP-18 column under 280, 254, 230, 225 and 210 nm, and then eluted by gradient aqueous MeOH (85%400%, 0-20 min) Only one symmetric peak was found in all the chromatograms in different detection conditions, indicating that GQ-5 is a HPLC grade pure compound (FIG. 1). Consistently, there was no impurity present in the 1H NMR spectrum. Example 4 Toxicological Experiment of the Urushiol Compound GQ-5 in Mice To test the toxicity of GQ-5, 20 C57BL/6J little male mice which are 7-8 months old, healthy and clean, their weights are between 20 and 22 gram. Antisepsis the feed and water, before and in the layoff period of the test, all the mice should be feed under the normal feeding condition. Dissolve GQ-5 in 0.5% propylene glycol, this liquor is given to little mice by intraperitoneal injection. The dosage of GQ-5 was 10, 40, 200, and 800 mg/kg body weight of mice. After administration, they are observed for 7 days. Mice intra-peritoneal injected with single dose of GQ-5 up to 800 mg/kg did not die or developed any adverse event during 7-day observation. Example 5 Toxicological Experiment of the Urushiol Compound GQ-5 To test the toxicity of GQ-5, rat proximal tubular cells (NRK52E) were seeded into 96-well plates in a volume of 200 μl per well (1×105 cell/ml) and incubated for 24 hours to allow cells to attach. The cells were then incubated with indicated amount of GQ-5 for 1 h. Cell viability was determined by addition of 20 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. After incubation for 4 hours, the medium was removed and 150 μl of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was read at 540 nm by using iMark™Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad). As shown in FIG. 2, GQ-5, over a complete pharmacologically relevant dose (0.25-4 μM), did not affect the viability and proliferation of the cells.

Cells were serum-starved for 12 h, and randomized into 6 groups: (1) Controls; (2) GQ-5 only; (3) TGF-β1 only; (4) TGF-β1+GQ-5 0.1 μM; (5) TGF-β1+GQ-5 0.5 μM; (6) TGF-β1+GQ-5 2.5 μM 2. Sample Source and Preparation (1) Controls: incubated with DMEM for 48 h; (2) GQ-5 only: pre-treated with GQ-5 (2.5 μM) for 1 h, followed with DMEM for 48 h (3) TGF-β1 only: pre-treated with DMSO for 1 h, followed with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 48 h (4) TGF-β1+GQ-5 0.1 μM: pre-treated with GQ-5 (0.1 μM) for 1 h, followed with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 48 h (5) TGF-β1+GQ-5 0.5 μM: pre-treated with GQ-5 (0.5 μM) for 1 h, followed with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 48 h (6) TGF-β1+GQ-5 2.5 μM: pre-treated with GQ-5 (2.5 μM) for 1 h, followed with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 48 h 3. Experimental Methods GQ-5 was dissolved in DMSO. Cells were treated as described. Cells lysates were immunebloted with antibodies against α-SMA, collagen I and fibronectin. 4. Results As shown in FIGS. 11A-11B, treatment with GQ-5 significantly inhibited TGF-β1-induced protein expression of α-SMA, collagen I and fibronectinin NRK 52E (FIG. 13A) and NRK 49F cells (FIG. 13B). Example 15 GQ-5 Ameliorates Renal Interstitial Fibrosis after UUO 1. Animal Model Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 4 groups (n=6 in each group): (1) sham operated rats; (2) UUO rats; (3) UUO+GQ-5 d1 rats; (4) UUO+GQ-5 d7 rats. 2. Sample Source and Preparation GQ-5 was dissolved in 5% propylene glycol. (1) Sham operated rats: daily intraperitoneal injection of 5% propylene glycol; (2) UUO rats: daily intraperitoneal injection of 5% propylene glycol; (3) UUO+GQ-5 d1 rats: daily intraperitoneal injection of GQ-5 (40 mg/kg body weight) right after UUO; (4) UUO+GQ-5 d7 rats: daily intraperitoneal injection of GQ-5 (40 mg/kg body weight) 7 days after UUO. 3. Experimental Methods UUO was performed using an established protocol as described. GQ-5 was dissolved in 5% propylene glycol. Rats were administrated with GQ-5 as described before. All the rats were sacrificed 14 days after UUO. HE staining, Masson trichrome staining were performed to examine the renal tissue injury, and Real-time PCR analyses, immunohistochemical staining, and Western blot analyses were performed to examine α-SMA, collagen I and fibronectin expression in kidney tissue 4. Results As shown in FIGS. 12A-12D, UUO rats exhibited marked interstitial inflammation and fibrosis in renal tissue stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson-trichrome. Treatment with GQ-5, either initiating right after or 7 days after operation, significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and interstitial fibrosis score. Intervention with GQ-5 also significantly inhibited the up-regulation of α-SMA, collagen I and fibronectin in UUO rats at both mRNA and protein level, suggesting that treatment of GQ-5 not only prevented renal fibrosis, but also ameliorated established renal fibrosis. Example 16 GQ-5 Selectively Blocks the Interaction of Smad3 with TβRI In Vitro 1. Cells. NRK52E cells were cultured in DMEM-Ham's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells reached at approximately 50% confluence were used for in vitro experiments. Cells were serum-starved for 12 h, and randomized into 4 groups: (1) Controls; (2) GQ-5 only; (3) TGF-β1 only; (4) TGF-β1+GQ-5 2. Sample Source and Preparation (1) Controls: incubated with DMEM for 2 h; (2) GQ-5 only: pre-treated with GQ-5 (2.5 nM) for 1 h, followed with DMEM for 1 h (3) TGF-β1 only: pre-treated with DMSO for 1 h, followed with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 1 h (4) TGF-β1+GQ-5: pre-treated with GQ-5 (2.5 nM) for 1 h, followed with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 1 h 3. Experimental Methods GQ-5 was dissolved in DMSO. Cells were treated as described. Cell lysates were collected for immunoprecipitation to examine the interaction among TGFβ type I receptor (TβRI), TβRII, Smad3 and Smad2. 4. Results As shown in FIGS. 13A-13C, TβRI bound with TβRII, Smad2 and Smad3 upon TGF-β1 stimulation. Treatment with GQ-5 significantly blocked the interaction of Smad3 with TβRI, but did not affect the interaction of Smad2 with TβRI. Example 17 GQ-5 Selectively Blocks the Interaction of Smad3 with T3RI In Vivo 1. Animal Model Male Sprague-Dawley rats with body weight 200 to 250 g were randomized into 3 groups (n=6 in each group): (1) sham operated rats; (2) UUO rats; (3) UUO+GQ-5 rats. 2. Sample Source and Preparation GQ-5 was dissolved in 5% propylene glycol. (1) Sham operated rats: daily intraperitoneal injection of 5% propylene glycol; (2) UUO rats: daily intraperitoneal injection of 5% propylene glycol; (3) UUO+GQ-5 rats: daily intraperitoneal injection of GQ-5 (40 mg/kg body weight) right after UUO; 3. Experimental Methods UUO was performed using an established protocol as described. GQ-5 was dissolved in 5% propylene glycol. Rats were administrated with GQ-5 as described before. All the rats were sacrificed 14 days after UUO. Immunoprecipitation analyses were performed to examine the interaction among TβRI, TβRII, Smad3 and Smad2. 4. Results As shown in FIGS. 14A-14C, TβRI bound with TβRII, Smad2 and Smad3 in UUO kidneys. Treatment with GQ-5 significantly blocked the interaction of Smad3 with TβRI, but did not affect the interaction of Smad2 with TβRI. In the description above, numerous specific details are set forth.
