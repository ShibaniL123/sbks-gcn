Step 2: Synthesis of di-μ-chloro-tetrakis[4'-methyl-2-(2-pyridinyl-κN)(1,1'-biphenyl)-3-yl-κC]iridium(III) (Abbreviation: [Ir(m6bpy)2Cl]2)
Into a 100-mL round-bottom flask were put 5.0 g (20 mmol) of 4'-methyl-2-(1,1'-biphenyl)-2-yl-pyridin (abbreviation: Hm6bpy) synthesized in Step 1, 2.9 g (9.6 mmol) of iridium chloride monohydrate, 35 mL of 2-ethoxyethanol, and 12 mL of water, and the atmosphere in the flask was replaced with argon. This reaction container was subjected to irradiation with microwaves (2.45 GHz, 100 W) for 3 hour to cause a reaction. After the reaction, the reaction solution was subjected to suction filtration to give 3.8 g of a yellow solid in a yield of 55%. The synthesis scheme of Step 2 is shown below.
