The upright surrounding wall 712 extends downwardly from the annular radial wall 711, is coaxially surrounded by the lower annular frame 43, and cooperates with the annular radial wall 711 to define an annular corner 710 therebetween. The processing clearance 403 has top and bottom ends, flares downwardly from a lower end of the grinding space 401, and when viewed in a cross-section, is tapered from the top end to the bottom end of the processing clearance 403. The driving unit 32 is connected to the conical upper part 77 of the rotary processing body 7 for driving rotation of the rotary processing body 7 about the rotation axis (X) . The blades 78 extend helically around the rotation axis (X) from the top end 774 to the bottom end 775 of the conical upper part 77. The annular filter 6 is disposed between the lower annular frame 43 and the upright surrounding wall 712, and cooperates with the upright surrounding wall 712 to define a processing gap 405 therebetween. The annular filter 6 is formed with apertures 61 so as to permit fluid communication between the processing gap 405 and the fluid channel 404 via the apertures 61. The residue outlet hole 337 is in fluid communication with the processing gap 405 . The annular radial wall 711 is formed with a plurality of spaced apart first processing ribs 72 that protrude therefrom into the processing clearance 403, that are angularly displaced from one another, and that extend curvedly from the lower end 775 of the conical upper part 77 to the annular corner 710 . The upright surrounding wall 712 is formed with a plurality of spaced apart second processing ribs 73 that protrude therefrom into the processing gap 405, that are angularly displaced from one another, and that extend downwardly and inclinedly relative to the rotation axis (X) from the first processing ribs 72, respectively, to a lower end portion of the upright surrounding wall 712. In this embodiment, the top cover 41 surrounds the conical upper part 77 and the lower part 71, and is formed with a plurality of processing fins 44 protruding therefrom into the grinding space 401 and the processing clearance 403 so as to cooperate with the blades 78 and the first processing ribs 72 to grind and squeeze food pas sing through the grinding space 401 and the processing clearance 403. The processing fins 44 extend downwardly and inclinedly relative to the rotation axis (X) from a top end 4101 of the cylindrical wall 410 to a lower end 4121 of the skirt wall 412. The processing gap 405 has top and bottom ends, and when viewed in a cross-section, is tapered from the top end to the bottom end of the processing gap 405. The top cover 41 is further formed with a plurality of guiding plates 45 that are angularly displaced from one another. Each of the guiding plates 45 extends downwardly from a lower end of a respective one of the processing fins 44 into the processing gap 405, isdisposedbetweenthe annular filter 6 and the upright surrounding wall 712, and has an inclined side 451 that extends downwardly and inclinedly relative to the rotation axis (X) from the lower end of the respective one of the processing fins 44 for guiding residue of the food entering the processing gap 405. In this embodiment, the upright surrounding wall 712 has a bottom end portion 7123 that has an annular inclined face 713 which is inclined relative to the rotation axis (X) and which faces toward the annular filter 6 and the second step portion 334. The bottom end portion 7123 of the upright surrounding wall 712 is formed with a plurality of residue-pushing tabs 74 that protrude downwardly from the annular inclined face 713 toward the annular filter 6 and the second step portion 334 and that are angularly displaced from one another. The second step portion 334 is formed with an annular residue-guiding trough 335 indented downwardly therefrom and in fluid communication with the residue outlet hole 3 37 . The bottom end portion 7123 of the upright surrounding wall 712 further has an annular middle face 714 that is disposed below and inwardly of the annular inclined face 713, that extends in a radial direction relative to the rotation axis (X) , and that faces toward the residue-guiding trough 335, and is further formed with a plurality of first teeth 75 that are angularly displaced from one another and that extend downward from the annular middle face 714 into the residue-guiding trough 335. Each of the first teeth 75 has an inclined side 751 that extends outwardly and inclinedly relative to the radial direction in a backward direction against a rotational direction (Υ) of the rotary processing body 7 (see Fig. 10). The annular stepped wall 33 further has a third step portion 336 that is disposed above the second step portion 334 and between the second step portion 334 and the rotation axis (X) . The bottom end portion 7123 of the upright surrounding wall 712 further has an annular inner face 715 that is disposed above and inwardly of the annular middle face 714 and that extends in the radial direction, and is further formed with a plurality of second teeth 76 that are angularly displaced from one another and that extend downward from the annular inner face 715 toward the third step portion 336. Each of the second teeth 76 has an inclined side 7 61 that extends outwardly and inclinedly relative to the radial direction in the backward direction against the rotational direction (Υ) of the rotary processing body 7. In operation, the rotary processing body 7 is rotated in the rotational direction (Υ) by the driving unit 32 and food is fed into the grinding space 401 through the inlet tube 42. Upon rotation, the blades 78 cooperate with the processing fins 44 to cut the food into small pieces, to squeeze juice from the food and to guide the pieces of the food and the juice to slide into the processing clearance 403. The pieces of the food in the processing clearance 403 are subsequently squeezed and crushed and are guided together with the juice into the processing gap 405 by the processing fins 44 and the first processing ribs 72 thatcooperatewiththe processing fins 44 to perform the cutting and squeezing. Since the processing gap 405 is tapered downwardly when viewed in a cross section, the second processing ribs 7 3 cooperate with the annular filter 6 to further squeeze and crush the pieces of the food to reduce the sizes of the pieces of the food in the processing gap 405 and to extract more juice out of the same. The squeezed juice is accumulated in the processing gap 405, and is caused to flow through the apertures 61 in the annular filter 6 into the fluid channel 404 and then into the fluid discharging tube 339, thereby separating the squeezed juice from the pieces of the food in the processing gap 405. The inclined sides 451 of the guiding plates 45 cooperate with the second processing ribs 73 to guide the pieces of the food, which become residue, in the processing gap 405 to fall downwardly, such that residue is accumulated both on the second step portion 334 of the annular stepped wall 33 and in the residue-guiding trough 335. Driven by the rotation of the rotary processing body 7, the residue-pushing tabs 74 sweep the residue on the second step portion 334 into the residue outlet hole 337 and the inclined sides 751 of the first teeth 75 sweep the residue in the residue-guiding trough 335 into the residue outlet hole 337, thereby permitting discharging of the residue into and through the residue discharging tube 338. In addition, the third step portion 336 of the annular stepped wall 33, which has a height greater than that of the second step portion 334, prevents the residue from moving into an inner space 701 definedbyan inner surface of the rotary processing body 7, the annular central wall 301 and the inner tubular wall 302. The inclined side 761 of the second teeth 76 push the residue that moves upwardly from the residue-guiding trough 335 toward the third step portion 336 back into the residue-guiding trough 335. In this embodiment, each of the first and second processing ribs 72, 73 has a strip shape. Alternatively, each of the first and second processing ribs 72, 73 can have a bar or block shape. With the inclusion of the rotary processing body 7 and the processing fins 44 in the food processor of the present invention, food can be cut and squeezed into tiny pieces to extract juice.
