Example 35 : Preparation of 2'-amino-6-(2-amino-6-(1-ethylpiperidin-4-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-[2,4'-bipyridin]-5-ol
Example 35-1 : Preparation of 1-(1-ethylpiperidin-4-yl)ethanone
1-(Piperidin-4-yl)ethanone hydrochloride(6.07 g, 21.85 mmol) obtained in Preparation Example 6-4 was dissolved in acetonitrile (75 mL). Potassium carbonate (K2CO3) (5.83 g, 34.96 mmol) and iodoethane (CH3CH2I) (2.77 mL, 28.41 mmol) were added dropwise to the resulting solution and the solution was stirred for 18 hrs. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate, diluted with EtOAc, and washed with water. The washed organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (dimethylchloride/methanol = 10/1) to give the white title compound (5.18 g, 76 %).
