Step 5 Synthesis of Compound (1-36)
Compound 26 (59.9 mg, 0.104 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (1 ml). N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (65 µL, 0.373 mmol), 1-ethylpiperidin-4-amine (18 µL, 0.124 mmol) and COMU (53.3 mg, 0.124 mmol) were added to the solution, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Sodium hydrogen carbonate aqueous solution was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and brine, successively and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was purified by silicagel column chromatography (ethyl acetate-methanol) to give Compound (I-36) (racemate, 49.8 mg, Yield 70%).
