FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an oral care composition comprising a fluoride ion source and a buffer. This invention also relates to a method of providing fluoride to the oral cavity of a mammal. The invention further relates to a method of treating or preventing a disease or condition of the oral cavity of a mammal. The invention further relates to the use of a buffer for controlling the pH of an oral care composition comprising fluoride. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is commonly accepted that fluoride anti caries efficacy is related to the prior formation of a CaF2 depot (ideally in form of a layer) on the enamel surface (Rølla G., ACTA ODONTOL SCAND 46 (1988)). For efficient formation of CaF2, conditions need to be slightly acidic since under neutral pH conditions, calcium phosphates form more readily than CaF2 even with the little phosphate that is available in saliva. Due to the relatively high buffer capacity of saliva (a consequence of the high level of carbonate ions), intra oral pH conditions are rarely kept at the advantageous slightly acidic level for the entire duration of product application. Fluoride can be provided by oral care products. The majority of oral care products are formulated at neutral pH. Therefore, they do not effectively form CaF2 layers and there is poor fluoride uptake onto the enamel surface of the teeth. A few oral care products are formulated at a slightly acidic pH, but do not maintain the intra oral pH at the desired level during application of the oral care product. EP0691124 discloses attempts to increase fluoride uptake by adding polymers to an oral care composition. A copolymer of N-vinylpyrrolidone and acrylic acid is used to improve the bioadhesion of bactericidal compounds and/or to provide an enhanced fluoride uptake. It would be desirable to improve the fluoride uptake from fluoride-containing oral care products. It has now surprisingly been found that fluoride uptake from oral care products can be increased by providing an oral care composition comprising a buffer that can counteract the buffering effect of saliva and hold the pH of the oral care composition at the slightly acidic level necessary to ensure formation of CaF2 layers. The buffer is able to buffer the oral care composition at the desired pH and also yield a stable product.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The features and benefits of the invention are illustrated by reference to the preferred embodiments. Accordingly, the invention expressly should not be limited to such preferred embodiments illustrating some possible non-limiting combination of features that may exist alone or in other combinations of features.

Orally Acceptable Vehicle The dentifrice composition according to the invention comprises an orally acceptable vehicle. As used herein, an “orally acceptable vehicle” refers to a material or combination of materials that are safe for use in the compositions of the invention, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.

Optionally, the toothpaste composition further comprises sodium monofluorophosphate in an amount of from 0.75 to 1.5 wt % based on the weight of the composition. Buffer A buffer in an aqueous solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. Buffer solutions maintain the pH of a solution by means of the equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base (or the base and its conjugate acid). The pKa value of an acid is a measure of the strength of an acid in solution. The Ka or acid dissociation constant (also known as the acidity constant or acid-ionization constant) is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an acid (HA) into its conjugate base (A−) and a proton (H+). The pKa is the logarithmic measure and is equal to −log10 Ka. Polyprotic acids that can lose more than proton can have successive pKa dissociation values for dissociation of successive protons. The pKa of an acid can be determined by titration. The pKa is determined at 25° C. unless otherwise stated. Apart from the required acid-base properties the buffer needs to be sufficiently soluble in the oral care formula backbone. Acids that are rather poorly soluble as a free acid but readily soluble in the form of an alkali salt form a reservoir of acid that is not in solution and is thus behaving neutral on taste. It is, however, available for buffering. While buffering takes place during the intra oral application of the product the acid solubilizes at the same rate as the protons are consumed by saliva. Since the concentration of free solubilized acid remains small during that process the influence on taste is minimal. Fumaric acid is an acid that works according to the mechanism described. Acid Number The acid number is a measure quantifying the buffering capacity of a product. The acid number or acid value expresses in milligrams the quantity of potassium hydroxide needed to neutralise the free acids present in 1 g of the product. The determination can be carried out e.g. by an adaptation of the method according to the protocol described in the European Pharmacopoeia 7.0 section 2.5.1. dissolving samples in water instead of ethanol/petroleum ether; and monitoring the end point with a pH electrode instead of with phenolphthalein indicator. Sample preparation: Weigh sample in a 150 ml beaker. The amount of sample depends on the expected acid value. As a guideline use approximately 5.0 g for toothpaste or gels or approximately 10 mL to 20 mL for mouth rinses. Add 50 mL of water pH 9 prepared previously and stir the sample until it's completely dissolved or until the resulting suspension is homogeneous. Titrate slowly and under stirring the sample solution using a 0.1N potassium hydroxide solution. End point of the titration is reached, when the pH of the solution is exactly 9.00 and it remains stable for at least 15 seconds (the drift should be less than 0.1 pH units/minute, or less than 0.025 pH units during 15 seconds). Calculation of the acid value is done as described above. This parameter yields the amount of protons neutralized but does not provide information on the pH at which buffering occurs. A product can have a high acid number but would do little to keep the pH constant at a particular pH of interest. Therefore the buffer substance must additionally have a pKa close to the desired pH that is to be kept constant. Ideally, the pKa of the buffer is within the range of the desired pH±1. The acid number of the oral composition is at least greater than or equal to 4.5. Optionally, the acid number is greater than or equal to 6.0. Optionally the acid number is greater than or equal to 6.45, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 or 10.0. Optionally the acid number is less than 25 or further optionally less than 18. pH In order to increase the fluoride uptake from the composition, the compositions of the present invention are buffered to maintain the pH at a slightly acidic level. By “slightly acidic” it is meant that the oral composition has a pH of less than 7.0 but greater than 3.5. An example of a pH that is considered slightly acidic is a pH of from 3.5 to 6.0 or from 4.0 to 6.0, or from 3.5 to 5.0 or from 4.0 to 5.0. A pH of 4.5 is considered to be slightly acidic in the context of this invention. Measurement of the pH can be carried by a procedure based on the method described in the European Pharmacopoeia 7.0, section 2.2.36. The fluoride concentration is measured at a constant ionic strength by using a fluoride selective electrode, Constant ionic strength in the measuring solution is ensured by the use of a TISAB (total ionic strength adjustment buffer). Fluoride is always measured as ionic fluoride (F−). Analysis is performed by measuring the difference in electrical potential of fluoride selective (ISE) and reference electrode immersed in the measuring solution. Sample preparation for toothpaste: Weigh a sample of approximately 200 mg to the nearest 0.1 milligram on the bottom of a 50 mL plastic beaker and add exactly 20.0 mL deionized water. Let stir for 5 minutes or until the sample is completely dissolved and the resulting suspension is homogeneous. Proceed to measurement of the pH as described above. Sample preparation for mouthrinse: Weigh a sample of approximately 1000 mg to the nearest milligram in a 50 mL plastic beaker and add 19.0 mL deionized water. Stir until the sample solution is homogenous. Proceed to measurement of the pH as described above. Optionally the pH of the oral composition is greater than 4.0. Further optionally, the pH of the oral composition is from 4.2 to 4.8. Further optionally, the pH of the oral composition is 4.5.

All of the ingredients in the compositions may have functions in addition to their primary function, and may contribute to the overall properties of the composition, including its stability, efficacy, consistency, mouthfeel, taste, odor and so forth. It is understood that while general attributes of each of the above categories of materials may differ, there may be some common attributes and any given material may serve multiple purposes within two or more of such categories of materials. Preferably, the carrier is selected for compatibility with other ingredients of the composition. Preparation The toothpaste composition of the invention may be prepared by any means known in the art. Examples Toothpaste formulation based on a silica base were prepared by using various concentrations of 1:1 buffer solutions prepared from the acids and their sodium/potassium salts. The acid/salt mixtures have been employed at levels from 0.5% to 2.00% total buffer concentration in the final formulation. The yielding toothpaste met all the stability criteria after accelerated aging from 6 months at 40° C. The pastes have been submitted to Enamel Fluoride Uptake (EFU) testing according to FDA Method #40. This method determines the fluoride uptake into caries like subsurface lesions affected by an in vitro treatment of tooth specimen with slurries of toothpastes. The buffered recipes were referenced against toothpastes of identical formula but without the buffering substance. Formulations tested are in Table 1. Results are summarized in Table 2.

Also a dose effect for the amount of buffer used was observed. Additionally, selected pastes were tested for the rermineralization potential. To do so, specimen derived from human teeth were initially demineralized (baseline) and then alternately exposed to an acid challenge (demineralization pH 5.00, 4 h daily) and a slurry of the toothpaste (remineralization, 4 treatments per day) for 20 days. Between acid exposure and treatments the specimens were stored in saliva. The degree of mineralization of the specimen was investigated by micro hardness measurements (VMH) and compared to the baseline. The higher the gain in hardness the more efficient the remineralization potential of the used product is. Again the pastes were referenced against paste of identical formula but without the buffering substance. Results are summarized in Table 3. TABLE 3 Values for hardness improvements for both buffered and non-buffered toothpastes Hardness improvement in Level of Vickers hardness numbers Toothpastes pH Buffer buffer (%) at day 20 from baseline 1 4.5 Malic acid 1.53 +30.3 ± 17.8 2 4.5 No buffer 0.00 +16.1 ± 9.8 3 4.5 Succinic acid 1.53 +23.6 ± 6.6 4 4.5 No buffer 0.00 +19.0 ± 5.4 In all cases the hardness improvement was significantly higher than for the respective control toothpaste. The results are in accordance with the EFU data. The buffered toothpastes also show an increased remineralization potential compared to state of the art toothpastes. It can be seen that pastes with increased buffer capacity lead to an improved fluoride uptake in caries-like lesions. Thus pastes according to the invention will have an increased anti-cavity effect compared to state of the art pastes. 1.
