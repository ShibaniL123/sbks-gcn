Synthesis of Compound 16
To a mixture of potassium carbonate (68.3 mg, 0.5 mmol) in water (5 mL) and compound 15 (67.2 mg, 0.33 mmol) in ethyl acetate (10 mL), a solution of acryloyl chloride (53.6 μL, 0.67 mmol) in ethyl acetate (10 mL) was added dropwise at 0° C. The resulting mixture was stirred at 0° C. in an ice bath for 10 minutes and then allowed to react at room temperature for 5 hours. The mixture was acidified with hydrochloric acid to adjust pH5. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL×2). The organic layers were combined and washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (20 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the solvent removed. The solid residue was purified by column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=10:1) to give product 16 as a yellow oil (63.1 mg, 61.7%). LC-MS m/z (ES+), 312.15 (M+H)+.
