TITLE OF THE INVENTION YEAST AND BACTERIA AS STABILIZERS IN EMULSIONS OF OIL AND WATER FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compositions, preferably liquid compositions comprising stable oil-in-water emulsions without the addition of one or more surfactants and/or emulsifiers in the liquid or solid state. The present invention also relates to the emulsions used in the compositions, wherein the emulsions are formed by the combination of oil plus water as well as a single cell microorganism, in one embodiment yeast, preferably Baker's yeast, or bacteria, preferably probiotic bacteria, most preferably inactivated bacteria, such as the genus Lactobacillus, Lactococcus or Streptococcus, or combinations thereof added when forming the emulsion. A stable emulsion generally refers to the ability of the emulsion to resist change in its properties over time. The single cell microorganism in the emulsion is capable of residing at the oil-water interface. Oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with these cells form stable emulsions, even in the absence of an emulsifier between the two phases. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Emulsions are widely used in the chemical, food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and agrochemical industries. Emulsions usually consist of two or more mutually-insoluble phases, such as oil and water, which try to lower their free energy by bulk phase-separating the oil and water. An emulsion may be stabilized against phase separation by addition of biopolymers such as hydrocolloids and proteins, small-molecule surfactants such as lecithin and polysorbates and solid micron- and nano-sized particles. When an emulsion is stabilized by solid particles, it is called a Pickering emulsion (Pickering, 1907). Pickering emulsions stabilized by insoluble solid particles show superior stability against coalescence compared with those stabilized with hydrocolloids, proteins and surfactants (Dickinson, 2009). The stabilization mechanism of Pickering emulsions is due to the formation of a steric barrier by solid particles around the dispersed droplets (Dickinson, 2010). Once absorbed at the liquid-liquid interface, the desorption energy of the particles from the interface is high, and the particles remain at the interface. In spite of the high potential of the use of colloidal particles as Pickering stabilizers, there are only a limited number of colloidal particles that may be used in the food industry (de Folter, van Ruijven, & Velikov, 2012; Dickinson, 2010; Liu & Tang, 2013; Yusoff & Murray, 2011). Examples of organic particles for use in food applications include: fat particles (Poortinga, 2008), β-lactoglobulin (Nguyen, Nicolai, & Benyahia, 2013), zein protein (de Folter, et al, 2012), hydrophobic cellulose particles (Wege, Kim, Paunov, Zhong, & Velev, 2008), soy protein nanoparticles (Liu, et al, 2013) and quinoa starch particles (Rayner, Timgren, Sjoo, & Dejmek, 2012). However, these groups of particles suffer from key limitations. Some of these, such as fat particles, are temperature-sensitive and will melt at typical processing temperatures. Others, like starch granules, lose their functionally, β-lactoglobulin, zein protein and soy protein nanoparticles can only be made on a lab-scale whereas hydrophobic cellulose particles have a relatively broad particle size distribution, which makes them less efficient as Pickering stabilizers. Preferably, the particles should be spherical-shaped with a defined particle size range. There are some limitations with the production of colloidal particles. Either the production processes of colloidal particles are very energy-intensive and expensive or they are complex and difficult for implementation in industry (Velikov & Pelan, 2008). It is rather difficult to produce food-grade particles with a defined size range, and most materials being used to produce colloidal particles are not acceptable in food systems (Liu & Tang, 2013). Overall, robust readily-available food-grade particles are scarce and/or production techniques for food- grade-particles are restricted by legislative regulations and/or are limited to small/lab-scale applications. It has been reported while using a mixture of petroleum hydrocarbons, water and mineral salts as a medium to grow yeast for feed production, the produced yeasts formed a very stable emulsion by the Pickering stabilization mechanism in the growth culture (Srivasta, Singh, Baruah, Krishna, & Iyengar, 1970). This ability of other single-celled microorganisms nesting at the petroleum hydrocarbon-water interface has been reported in the scientific literature (Rosenberg & Rosenberg, 1985). A decade ago, it was shown how to make Pickering emulsions using n- alkane-degrading bacteria to stabilize n-hexadecane-water mixtures (Dorobantu, Yeung, Foght, & Gray, 2004). More recently, Pickering emulsions were made with Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli DH5a, as colloidal particles with the addition of chitosan (biopolymer) to hold these cells at the oil-water interface. When the dispersed phase in an emulsion has a higher volume fraction than that of the continuous phase, the emulsion is called a high internal phase ratio emulsion (Lissant 1966; Williams 1991 ; Reynolds, Gilbert et al. 2000). These emulsions are known by variety of names including highly-concentrated emulsions, (Princen, Aronson et al. 1980; Babak and Stebe 2002) and gel emulsions (Kunieda, Solans et al. 1987). High internal phase ratio emulsions have practical applications in foods, cosmetics (Jager-Lezer, Tranchant et al. 1998), topical drug delivery systems (Riess and Weers 1996), extraction of antibiotics and pollutants (Lye and Stuckey 1998) and other important industrial applications (Krafft and Riess 1994; Babak and Stebe 2002). Despite the superiority of the particles to stabilize an oil in water emulsion in comparison to surfactants and biopolymers, the use of particles to make a oil in water Pickering emulsion with an internal phase ratio higher than 0.71 did not work (Binks and Lumsdon 2000; Kralchevsky, Ivanov et al. 2005; Masalova and Kharatyan 2013). Accordingly, there is a need for the production of food-grade stable emulsions comprising edible single cell microorganisms. There is also need for oil-in-water emulsions that are stable and have a high oikwater weight ratio.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS With reference to Figure 1, the effect of gradual weight increments in yeast concentration (wt %) from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 on, producing 50 wt% oil + 49-41 wt% water emulsion, are shown. Sample 0 is 50 wt% water + 50 wt% oil without any added cells. By adding 1 wt% yeast to 49 wt% water + 50 wt% oil (vial 1), the bulk oil phase is dispersed into droplets. Vial 2 shows an emulsion made with 2 wt% yeast + 48 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 3 shows an emulsion made with 3 wt% yeast + 47 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 4 shows an emulsion made with 4 wt% yeast + 46 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 5 shows an emulsion made with 5 wt% yeast + 45 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 6 shows an emulsion made with 6 wt% yeast + 44 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 7 shows an emulsion made with 7 wt% yeast + 43 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 8 shows an emulsion made with 8 wt% yeast + 42 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 9 shows an emulsion made with 9 wt% yeast + 41 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. By increasing the yeast concentration to 9 wt%, the oil phase (droplets) is uniformly distributed and not phase-separated. Samples were prepared with a vortex mixer. With reference to Figure 2, the effect of gradual increments in pH from 3 (p3) to pH 4 (p4), pH 5 (p5),pH 6 (p6), pH 7 (p7), and pH 8 (p8) as well as the effect of a gradual increase in salt concentration, e.g., 1 wt% (si), 2 wt% (s2), 3 wt% (s3) and 4 wt% (s4) on the capability of 3 wt% yeast to produce a 50 wt% oil + 47 wt% water emulsion are shown. By adding electrolyte (salts), the capability of yeast cells to form an oil-in- water emulsion is increased. As shown, sample 0 is 47 wt% water + 50 wt% oil containing 3 wt% yeast without any electrolyte (salt). By adding 1 wt% salt (NaCl) (e.g., 46 wt % water + 50 wt% oil vial si), the capacity of yeast to form an emulsion increases, though there were no significant changes on emulsion formation in the system by adding 2 wt% salt, vial s2 (45 wt% water + 50 wt% oil), 3 wt% salt, vial s3 (44 wt% water + 50 wt% oil) or 4 wt% salt, vial s4 (43 wt% water + 50 wt% oil). Likewise, by using a buffer solution, due to the effect of electrolytes, the capability of yeast to form an emulsion increases, and by moving the pH from 8 (p8) to pH 7 (p7), pH 6 (p6), pH 5 (p5), pH 4 (p4), and pH 3 (p3), the capacity of yeast to form 50 wt% water + 47 wt% oil increases with the oil phase occupying a greater proportion of the emulsion volume. Samples were prepared with a vortex mixer. With reference to Figure 3, the effect of gradual increments in Streptococcus thermophilus concentration (wt %) from 1 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 on producing 50 wt% oil + 49-41 wt% water emulsions are shown. Sample 0 is 50 wt% water + 50 wt% oil without any added cells. By adding 1 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus to 49 wt% water + 50 wt% oil (vial 1), the bulk oil phase is dispersed into droplets. Vial 2 shows an emulsion made with 2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 48 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 3 shows an emulsion made with 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 47 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 4 shows an emulsion made with 4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 46 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 5 shows an emulsion made with 5 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 45 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 6 shows an emulsion made with 6 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 44 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 7 shows an emulsion made with 7 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 43 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 8 shows an emulsion made with 8 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 42 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 9 shows an emulsion made with 9 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 41 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. By increasing the Streptococcus thermophilus concentration to 9 wt%, the oil phase occupies a greater proportion of the emulsion volume. Samples were prepared with a vortex mixer. With reference to Figure 4, the effect of a gradual, incremental increase in pH from 3 (p3) to pH 4 (p4), pH 5 (p5), pH 6 (p6), pH 7 (p7) and pH 8 (p8) as well as the effect of a gradual increase in salt concentration from 1 wt% (si) to 2 wt% (s2), 3 wt% (s3), and 4 wt% (s4) on the capability of 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus to produce 50 wt% oil + 47 wt% water emulsion is shown. By adding electrolyte (salts), the capability of Streptococcus thermophilus cells to form an oil-in- water emulsion increases. As is shown, sample 0 is a 47 wt% water + 50 wt% oil mixture containing 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus without any electrolyte (salt). By adding 1 wt% salt (NaCl) (e.g., 46 wt % water + 50 wt% oil, vial si), the capacity of Streptococcus thermophilus to form an emulsion increases, though there were no significant changes on the formation of the emulsion in the system by adding 2 wt% salt, vial s2 (45 wt% water + 50 wt% oil), 3 wt% salt, vial s3 (44 wt% water + 50 wt% oil), or 4 wt% salt, vial s4 (43 wt% water + 50 wt% oil). Likewise, by using a buffer solution, due to the presence of the electrolyte, the capability of Streptococcus thermophilus to form an emulsion is increased in comparison to a sample without electrolyte (vial 0). However, by decreasing the pH from 8 (p8) to pH 7 (p7), pH 6 (p6), pH 5 (p5), pH 4 (p4), and pH 3 (p3), the capacity of Streptococcus thermophilus to form 50 wt% water + 47 wt% oil slightly decreases, with the emulsion phase occupying a smaller proportion of the emulsion volume. Samples were prepared with a vortex mixer. With reference to Figure 5, the effect of an incremental weight increase in Lactobacillus acidophilus concentration (wt %) from 1 to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 on, producing 50 wt% oil + 49- 42 wt% water emulsion is shown. Sample 0 is 50 wt% water + 50 wt% oil without any added cells. By adding 1 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus to 49 wt% water + 50 wt% oil (vial 1), the bulk oil phase is dispersed into droplets. Vial 2 shows an emulsion made with 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 48 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 3 shows an emulsion made with 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 47 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 4 shows an emulsion made with 4 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 46 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 5 shows an emulsion made with 5 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 45 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 6 shows an emulsion made with 6 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 44 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 7 shows an emulsion made with 7 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 43 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. Vial 8 shows an emulsion made with 8 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 42 wt% water + 50 wt% oil. By increasing the Lactobacillus acidophilus concentration to 8 wt%, the oil phase occupies a greater proportion of the emulsion volume. Samples were prepared with a vortex mixer. Figure 6 shows the effect of an incremental increase in pH from 3 (p3) to pH 4 (p4), pH 5 ( p5), pH 6 (p6), pH 7 (p7) and pH 8 (p8) as well as the effect of a gradual increase in salt concentration, e.g., 1 wt% (si), 2 wt% (s2), 3 wt% (s3) and 4 wt% (s4), on the capability of 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus to produce 50 wt% oil + 47 wt% water emulsion. By adding electrolyte (salts), the capability of Lactobacillus acidophilus cells to form an oil-in-water emulsion increases. As is shown, sample 0 is 47 wt% water + 50 wt% oil containing 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus without any electrolyte (salt). By adding 1 wt% salt (NaCl) (e.g., 46 wt % water + 50 wt% oil vial si), the capacity of Lactobacillus acidophilus to form an emulsion increases. However, there were no significant changes in emulsion formation by adding 2 wt% salt, vial s2 (45 wt% water + 50 wt% oil), 3 wt% salt, vial s3 (44 wt% water + 50 wt% oil), or 4 wt% salt, vial s4 (43 wt% water + 50 wt% oil). Likewise, by using a buffer solution, due to the effect of electrolytes, the capability of Lactobacillus acidophilus to form an emulsion increases as compared to the sample without electrolyte (vial 0). However, by decreasing the pH from 8 (p8) to pH 7 (p7), pH 6 (p6), pH 5 (p5), pH 4 (p4) and pH 3 (p3), the capacity of Lactobacillus acidophilus to form 50 wt% water + 47 wt% oil slightly decreases, the oil phase occupies a smaller proportion of the emulsion volume. Samples were prepared with a vortex mixer. Figure 7 presents three yeast-containing oil-in-water emulsions with different compositions. Sample (a) shows an emulsion made with 9 wt% yeast + 60 wt% oil + 31 wt% water. Sample (b) shows an emulsion made with 8 wt% yeast + 65 wt% oil + 27 wt% water. Sample (c) shows an emulsion made with 7 wt% yeast + 70 wt% oil + 23 wt% water. In this instance, to generate the emulsions, the oil phase was dispersed as oil droplets throughout the whole volume of the system. Therefore, in the emulsions with a lower oil content, a higher particle (cell) concentration was required to produce a higher number of oil droplets in order to increase the phase volume of the oil phase (e.g., with 60 wt% oil to produce a one-phase emulsion, 9 wt% yeast is required, but with a higher oil content, such as 65 wt% and 70 wt% oil, it is possible to use a lower yeast concentration, such as 8 wt% and 7 wt% to produce a single phase emulsion). Samples were prepared with a magnetic stirrer and a magnetic stir bar. With reference to Figure 8 (a, b, c), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images show oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with yeast cells. The microstructure of the emulsions resembles that of typical oil-in-water emulsions, where the aqueous phase (water) forms a continuous phase containing the oil droplets. Figure 8(a) shows an emulsion consisting of 7 wt% yeast + 70 wt% oil + 23 wt% water. Figure 8(b) shows an emulsion made of 8 wt% yeast + 65 wt% oil + 27 wt% water. Figure 8(c) shows an emulsion consisting of 9 wt% yeast + 60 wt% oil + 31 wt% water. The microstructure clearly indicates that by increasing the yeast cell concentration, the size of oil droplets is reduced. With reference to Figure 9, the shear viscosity versus shear rate of the emulsions of (7 wt% yeast + 70 wt% oil + 23 wt% water), (8 wt% yeast + 65 wt% oil + 27 wt% water), and (9 wt% yeast + 60 wt% oil + 31 wt% water), illustrates the viscosity of samples with different compositions. In these tests, the apparent viscosity for all samples was measured at 25°C at a shear rate in the range of 1 to 1000 s"1. Each sample was first pre-sheared at a constant shear rate of Is"1 for 60 seconds. Then, the sample was allowed to rest for 2 minutes on the testing tool before data was collected. The sample containing 7 wt% yeast showed a lower viscosity at a low shear rate as compared to that of samples containing 8 wt% and 9 wt% yeast. These samples containing 8 wt% and 9 wt% yeast showed similar viscosities. With reference to Figure 10, the effect of increasing oil content from 40 wt% to 80 wt% on the formation of one-phase emulsions containing 2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus is illustrated. As the oil content increases and the water content decreases, the two-phase systems transform into a one-phase arrangement. As is shown, the emulsion volume increases with a gradual increase in oil content. Vial (a) contains 40 wt% oil + 58 wt% water + 2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Vial (b) contains 50 wt% oil + 48 wt% water + 2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Vial (c) contains 60 wt% oil + 38 wt% water + 2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Vial (d) contains 70 wt% oil + 28 wt% water + 2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Vial (e) contains 80 wt% oil + 18 wt% water + 2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. The sample in vial (e) transformed into a gel-like emulsion. Samples were prepared with a magnetic stirrer and a magnetic stir bar. With reference to Figure 11, the physical appearance of the emulsion made with 80 wt% oil + 18 wt% water +2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus (vial e, Figure 10) is illustrated. The emulsion formed a gel which can support its own weight. With reference to Figure 12, the effect of increasing oil content from 40 wt% to 70 wt% on the formation of one-phase emulsion containing 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus is illustrated. As the oil content increases and water content decreases, the two-phase systems transform into a one-phase arrangement. As is shown, the emulsion volume increases with a gradual increase in oil content. Vial (a) contains 40 wt% oil + 57 wt% water + 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Vial (b) contains 50 wt% oil + 47 wt% water + 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Vial (c) contains 60 wt% oil + 37 wt% water + 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Vial (d) contains 70 wt% oil + 27 wt% water + 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. The sample in vial (d) transformed into a gel-like emulsion. Samples were prepared with a magnetic stirrer and a magnetic stir bar. With reference to Figure 13, the effect of increasing oil content from 40 wt% to 70 wt% on the formation of one-phase emulsion containing 4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus is illustrated. As the oil content increases and the corresponding water content decreases, the two-phase systems transform into a one-phase arrangement. As is shown, the emulsion volume increases with a gradual increase in oil content. Vial (a) contains 40 wt% oil + 56 wt% water + 4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Vial (b) contains 50 wt% oil + 46 wt% water + 4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Vial (c) contains 60 wt% oil + 36 wt% water + 4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Vial (d) contains 70 wt% oil + 26 wt% water + 4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. The sample in vial (d) transformed into a gel-like emulsion. Samples were prepared with a magnetic stirrer and a magnetic stir bar. With reference to Figure 14, the effect of increasing cell content {Streptococcus thermophilus) from 3 wt% to 7 wt% on the formation of one-phase emulsions containing 60 wt% oil is illustrated. As the cell content increases and the corresponding water content decreases, the two- phase system transform into a one-phase arrangement. As is shown, the emulsion phase volume increases with a gradual increase in Streptococcus thermophilus content. Vial (a) contains 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 37 wt% water + 60 wt% oil. Vial (b) contains 4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 36 wt% water + 60 wt% oil. Vial (c) contains 5 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 35 wt% water + 60 wt% oil. Vial (d) contains 6 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 34 wt% water + 60 wt% oil. Vial (e) contains 7 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 33 wt% water + 60 wt% oil. The sample in vial (e) transformed into a gel-like emulsion. Samples were prepared with a magnetic stirrer and a magnetic stir bar. With reference to Figure 15, the effect of increasing oil content from 40 wt% to 75 wt% on the formation of one-phase emulsions containing 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus is illustrated. As the oil wt% content increases and the corresponding water wt% content decreases, the two-phase system transforms into a one-phase arrangement. As is shown, the emulsion volume increases with a gradual increase in oil content. Vial (a) contains 40 wt% oil + 58 wt% water + 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Vial (b) contains 50 wt% oil + 48 wt% water + 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Vial (c) contains 60 wt% oil + 38 wt% water + 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Vial (d) contains 70 wt% oil + 28 wt% water + 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Vial (e) contains 75 wt% oil + 23 wt% water + 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. The sample in vial (e) transformed into a gel -like emulsion. Samples were prepared with a magnetic stirrer and a magnetic stir bar. With reference to Figure 16, the physical appearance of an emulsion made with 75 wt% oil + 23 wt% water +2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus (vial (e), Figure 10) is illustrated. The emulsion formed a gel which can support its own weight. With reference to Figure 17, the effect of increasing oil content from 40 wt% to 70 wt% on the formation of one-phase emulsions containing 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus is illustrated. As the oil wt% content increases and the corresponding water wt% content decreases, the two-phase system transforms into a one-phase arrangement. As is shown, the emulsion volume increases with a gradual increase in oil content. Vial (a) contains 40 wt% oil + 57 wt% water + 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Vial (b) contains 50 wt% oil + 47 wt% water + 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Vial (c) contains 60 wt% oil + 37 wt% water + 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Vial (d) contains 70 wt% oil + 27 wt% water + 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. The sample in vial (d) transformed into a gel-like emulsion. Samples were prepared with a magnetic stirrer and a magnetic stir bar. With reference to Figure 18, the effect of increasing oil content from 40 wt% to 65 wt% on formation of one-phase emulsions containing 4 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus is illustrated. As the oil wt% content increases and the corresponding water wt% content decreases, the two-phase systems transform to a one-phase arrangement. As is shown, the emulsion volume increases with a gradual increase in oil content. Vial (a) contains 40 wt% oil + 56 wt% water + 4 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Vial (b) contains 50 wt% oil + 46 wt% water + 4 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Vial (c) contains 60 wt% oil + 36 wt% water + 4 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Vial (d) contains 65 wt% oil + 31 wt% water + 4 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. The sample in vial (d) transformed into a gel-like emulsion, Samples were prepared with a magnetic stirrer and a magnetic stir bar. With reference to Figure 19, the effect of increasing cell content wt% {Lactobacillus acidophilus) from 2 wt% to 5 wt% on the formation of one-phase emulsions containing 60 wt% oil is illustrated. As the oil wt% content increases and the corresponding water wt% content decreases, the two-phase systems transform to a one-phase arrangement. As is shown, the oil phase volume increases by gradual increments with the Lactobacillus acidophilus content. Vial (a) contains 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 38 wt% water + 60 wt% oil. Vial (b) contains 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 37 wt% water + 60 wt% oil. Vial (c) contains 4 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 36 wt% water + 60 wt% oil. Vial (d) contains 5 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 35 wt% water + 60 wt% oil. The sample in vial (d) transformed into a gel-like emulsion. Samples were prepared with a magnetic stirrer and a magnetic stir bar. With reference to Figure 20, it is shown that active (live) cells also are capable of forming one- phase oil-in-water emulsions. The emulsion in vial (a) is made of 80 wt% oil + 18 wt% water + 2 wt% active (live) Streptococcus thermophilus. The emulsion in vial (b) made is of 80 wt% oil + 17 wt% water + 3 wt% active (live) Streptococcus thermophilus. The emulsion in vial (c) is made of 80 wt% oil + 16 wt% water + 4 wt% active (live) Streptococcus thermophilus. With reference to Figure 21 (a, b, c), the CLSM images show oil-in-water emulsions made with active (live) Streptococcus thermophilus cells. The Figure 21 -a emulsion is made of 80 wt% oil + 18 wt% water + 2 wt% active Streptococcus thermophilus. The Figure 21 -b emulsion is made of 80 wt% oil + 17 wt% water + 3 wt% active Streptococcus thermophilus. The Figure 21-c emulsion is made of 80 wt% oil + 16 wt% water + 4 wt% active Streptococcus thermophilus. Due to the high proportion of the oil (80 wt%) the oil droplets are in a close-packed arrangement, and as the Streptococcus thermophilus weight concentration increases, the number of oil droplets increase and the oil droplet size decreases. With reference to Figure 22, shear viscosity versus shear rate is shown for emulsions made of (2 wt% active Streptococcus thermophilus + 80 wt% oil + 18 wt% water), (3 wt% active Streptococcus thermophilus + 80 wt% oil + 17 wt% water) and (4 wt% active Streptococcus thermophilus + 80 wt% oil + 16 wt% water). In these tests, the apparent viscosity for all samples was measured at 25°C at shear rates in the range of 1 to 1000 s"1. Each sample was first pre- sheared at a constant shear rate of 1 s"1 for 60 seconds. Then, each sample was allowed to rest for 2 minutes on the testing tool before data was collected. The sample containing 2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus showed a lower viscosity at a low shear rate in comparison to samples containing 4 wt% and 3 wt% yeast. At higher shear rates, samples containing 2 wt% and 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus showed similar viscosities, lower than that of samples containing 4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. With reference to Figure 23, the CLSM image shows an oil-in-water emulsion of 80 wt% oil + 18 wt% water + 2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Due to the high proportion of oil (80 wt%), the oil droplets are in a close-packed arrangement. With reference to Figure 24, the CLSM image shows an oil-in-water emulsion comprised of 70 wt% oil + 27 wt% water + 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Its microstructure resembles a typical oil-in-water emulsion, where the water forms a continuous phase containing the oil droplets. With reference to Figure 25, the CLSM image shows an oil-in-water emulsion comprised of 70 wt% oil + 26 wt% water + 4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Its microstructure resembles a typical oil-in-water emulsion where the water forms a continuous phase containing the oil droplets. As the cell concentration increases to 4 wt% in this system, the oil droplets become more uniform in size. With reference to Figure 26, the CLSM image shows an oil-in-water emulsion comprised of 60 wt% oil + 33 wt% water + 7 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus. Its microstructure resembles a typical oil-in-water emulsion, where the water forms a continuous phase containing the oil droplets. As the cell concentration increases to 7 wt% in this system, the oil droplets become more uniform and fill the entire emulsion. With reference to Figure 27, shear viscosity versus shear rate is shown for emulsions made of (2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 80 wt% oil + 18 wt% water), emulsions made of (3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 70 wt% oil + 27 wt% water), emulsions made of (4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 70 wt% oil + 26 wt% water) and emulsions made of (7 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 60 wt% oil + 33 wt% water). In these tests, the apparent viscosity for all samples was measured at 25°C at shear rates within the range of 1 to 1000 s"1. Each sample was first pre-sheared at a constant shear rate of 1 s"1 for 60 seconds. Then, each sample was allowed to rest for 2 minutes on the testing tool before data was collected. The sample containing 4 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 70 wt% oil + 26 wt% water showed the highest viscosity overall in comparison with that of other samples. The sample containing 3 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus + 70 wt% oil + 27 wt% water showed the lowest viscosity. The samples containing 80 wt% oil and 60 wt% oil, despite their different oil contents, exhibit similar viscosity profiles at a low shear rate and show similar trends with regard to viscosity changes as a function an applied shear rate. However, at a high shear rate, the emulsion containing 60 wt% oil shows the highest viscosity and the sample containing 80 wt% oil shows the lowest viscosity. With reference to Figure 28, the CLSM image shows an oil-in-water emulsion containing 75 wt% oil + 23 wt% water + 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Due to the high proportion of the oil (75 wt%), the oil droplets are in a close-packed arrangement. With reference to Figure 29, the CLSM image shows an oil-in-water emulsion containing 70 wt% oil + 27 wt% water + 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Some of the oil droplets are in a close-packed arrangement. With reference to Figure 30, the CLSM image shows an oil-in-water emulsion containing 65 wt% oil + 31 wt% water + 4 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Its microstructure resembles a typical oil-in-water emulsion, where the water forms a continuous phase containing the oil droplets. With reference to Figure 31, the CLSM image shows an oil-in-water emulsion containing 60 wt% oil + 35 wt% water + 5 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. Its microstructure resembles a typical oil-in-water emulsion, where the water forms a continuous phase containing the oil droplets. With reference to Figure 32, shear viscosity versus shear rate is shown for emulsions comprised of (2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 75 wt% oil + 23 wt% water), (3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 70 wt% oil + 27 wt% water), (4 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 65 wt% oil + 31 wt% water) and (5 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 60 wt% oil + 35 wt% water). Each sample was first pre-sheared at a constant shear rate of 1 s"1 for 60 seconds. Then, each sample was allowed to rest for 2 minutes on the testing tool before data was collected. The sample containing 3 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 70 wt% oil + 27 wt% water showed the highest viscosity at a low shear rate in comparison with other samples. The sample containing 5 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus + 60 wt% oil + 35 wt% water showed the lowest viscosity. The samples containing 75 wt% oil and 65 wt% oil, despite their different oil contents, exhibited similar viscosities at a low shear rate up to around 9 s"1. However, they showed a different trend with regard to changes in viscosity at a higher shear rate. The sample containing 65 wt% oil and 4 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus showed a higher viscosity as compared to that of the sample containing 75 wt% oil with 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus. The emulsion containing 60 wt% oil with 5 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus showed the lowest viscosity at a low shear rate but the highest viscosity at a high shear rate. This difference in viscosity is related to the presence of different quantities of bacterial cells and the overall compositions of different emulsions. With reference to Figure 33 (a, b, c), each CLSM image shows an oil droplet in an oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with different cells adsorbed at oil-water interface. Figure 33-a shows Streptococcus thermophilus cells, Figure 33-b shows Lactobacillus acidophilus cells and Figure 33-c shows yeast cells adsorbed at oil-water interface. For the above examples, the following conditions were applied. Material Baker's yeast (Sacchromyces cerevisiae) was supplied by Lesaffre, (Red Star brand) (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus thermophilus were purchased from Custom Probiotics (Glendale, CA, USA). Salt (NaCl), citric acid and sodium phosphate dibasic (Na2HP04) were supplied by Fisher Scientific (Ottawa, ON, Canada). Distilled water was used throughout. Olive oil was purchased from a local supermarket. Buffer solution Buffer solutions with a pH range from 3 to 8 were obtained by combining appropriate volumes of 0.1M citric acid with 0.2M sodium phosphate dibasic solutions. Cell preparation Although treatment of the cells is optional, it is possible to use live (active) cells for preparation of emulsions. However, in order to prevent the biological activity of the cells within the emulsion, the following protocol for cell preparation was used to inactivate the cells. The yeast cells, Lactobacillus acidophilus, or Streptococcus thermophilus were suspended in distilled water at a concentration of 10 wt% in a sealed screw cap glass bottle. The cell-containing bottles were placed in a waterbath at 95°C for 10 min and shaken regularly every 5-6 min for 15-20 sec. Then, the glass bottle was removed from the waterbath and left at room temperature to cool in order for centrifugation. The supernatant was discarded and the sediment was transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and washed 5-7 times with about 30 ml of distilled water by repeated re- suspension/centrifugation cycles 5 minutes for yeast and 30 minutes for Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus thermophilus at 3500 rpm. At the final stage of centrifugation, a clear transparent supernatant (water) and a homogeneous and uniform sediment containing cells were obtained. Any method known to a person of ordinary skill in the art for inactivating said cells may be used. The majority of the examples were prepared with inactive cells, however when active cells were utilized in the examples, the use of active cells are clearly described. Mixing procedure Two procedures were adopted for mixing; either mixing was performed with a vortex mixer (Fisher Scientific, cat No 02215570, Nepean, ON, Canada) or with a magnetic stirrer (IKA® C- MAG HS7) and a magnetic stir bar 25 mm in length and 9 mm in width. In both cases, the oil phase was mixed gradually with the entire aqueous phase consisting of water and cells. When a vortex mixer was employed, the addition of oil and mixing were performed in consecutive stages of oil addition (around 1 gram) followed by 20 seconds of mixing with the vortex mixer at 3000 rpm; this procedure was continued until all oil was added and mixed within the entire mixture. When a magnetic stirrer and a magnetic stir bar were used, the whole aqueous phase (water + cells) was placed in a vial and the oil phase was added drop-wise at a rate of 1 cm3 per 90 to 100 seconds to the aqueous phase and with the magnetic stirrer mixing at a rate of 448 to 560 revolution per minute. Mixing was continued until the entire oil phase was incorporated into the mixture. Incomplete mixing fails to produce the emulsion. Also, if the aqueous phase changes from a continuous phase to a dispersed phase, the emulsion is not formed. Any mixing procedure known to a person of ordinary skill in the art resulting in a stable emulsion as defined herein is applicable. Small-deformation rheometry A Physica MCR 301 rheometer (Anton Paar GmbH, Graz, Austria), equipped with a Peltier plate temperature control unit (P-PTD 200), was used to perform small-deformation oscillatory rheometery. All measurements were carried out with a cone and plate geometry (CP 25-1/TG) with a diameter of 25 mm, angle 1°, and an operation gap of 48 μηι. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using an upright Zeiss LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss, Toronto, ON, Canada). The CLSM was operated in fluorescent mode with an Ar laser source (488 nm). The emission spectra were collected with 1 channel set at 650 nm. No fluorescent labeling was used for cell-containing samples, since autofluorescence properties of the cells and olive oil were sufficient for CLSM observation. For characterization, 10 χ ,20 χ and 63 χ water emersion objective lenses were used. Images were recorded at 25 °C at a resolution of 1024 χ 1024 pixels. Image optimization was performed using the LSM 510's built-in image analysis software. Images shown herein are representative of the microstructure seen for a given composition. With the use of cells, it is possible to produce a stable oil-in-water emulsion with the internal- phase ratio more than 0.71. In one instance with Streptococcus thermophilus , the intemal phase can reach ca. 0.80 (80 wt% + 18 wt% water + 2 wt% Streptococcus thermophilus) and with Lactobacillus acidophilus, the intemal phase can reach ca. 0.75 (75 wt% oil + 23 wt% water + 2 wt% Lactobacillus acidophilus). This means that although the oil phase has a higher volume that that of the aqueous phase, the oil phase remains as a discontinuous or dispersed phase within the continuous aqueous phase and the emulsion remains stable. Although the above examples are on a laboratory scale, a person of ordinary skill in the art reading the above examples will be able to carry out the present invention on an industrial scale. As many changes can be made to the preferred embodiment of the invention without departing from the scope thereof; it is intended that all matter contained herein be considered illustrative of the invention and not in a limiting sense. 1.
