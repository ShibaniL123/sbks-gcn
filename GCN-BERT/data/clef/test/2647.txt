FIELD OF THE INVENTION Water Soluble unit dose articles and methods of using thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Water soluble unit dose articles have become very popular with the consumer. Such articles are usually constructed of one or more water-soluble films shaped to provide at least one internal compartment. Contained within the internal compartment is a detergent composition. Upon addition to water, the water-soluble film dissolves releasing the composition in to the wash liquor. Such unit dose articles can be used in automatic laundry washing machines or automatic ware washing operations (such as automatic dish washing). The unit dose article is added to the drum, or internal space of the washing machine together with the fabrics/garments or ware items to be washed. Upon addition of water to the wash process, the water-soluble film dissolves releasing the composition into the wash liquor. Multicompartment unit dose articles provide the added benefit of being able to separate incompatible ingredients into the different compartments. Upon addition of water, the contents of the separate compartments are released and the various ingredients are free to provide their individual benefits during the wash. However, during storage and ahead of use, these ingredients are not in contact with one another. The compartments are either arranged in a superposed orientation (i.e. on top of one another), or in a side-by-side orientation. However, an issue with known side-by-side orientated unit dose articles is the lack of structural rigidity between the compartments. Often the compartments are separated by a ‘bridge’ or ‘connector’ made of water-soluble film. This means that when the consumer picks up the unit dose article it appears ‘floppy’ since there is differential movement between the compartments. If the consumer holds one compartment, the weight of the composition of the other compartment makes it ‘sag’ down, hence making the unit dose article appear ‘floppy’. The consumers equate this with ‘cheap’ product or ‘lacking cleaning chemistry’. Furthermore, such unit dose articles may suffer from unplanned rupturing. This is due to the weight of one compartment putting undue load pressure on the film causing it to overstretch and rupture in the bridge region or the second compartment or both. There remains a need in the art for providing incompatible ingredients to a wash operation in a consumer accepted manner. It was surprisingly found a multicompartment unit dose article comprising incompatible components separated into separate compartments and wherein the unit dose article comprises a top wall, a bottom wall, an inner wall and an outer wall, and wherein the first compartment is defined as the internal space between the top wall, the bottom wall and the inner wall, and wherein the second compartment is defined as the internal space between the inner wall, the outer wall, the top wall and the bottom wall, and wherein the walls comprise the water-soluble film overcame this and other technical issues. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A first aspect of the present invention is a multicompartment water-soluble unit dose article comprising a water-soluble film, wherein a first compartment comprises a first composition and a second compartment comprises a second composition, and wherein the unit dose article comprises a top wall, a bottom wall, an inner wall and an outer wall, and wherein the first compartment is defined as the internal space between the top wall, the bottom wall and the inner wall, and wherein the second compartment is defined as the internal space between the inner wall, the outer wall, the top wall and the bottom wall, and wherein the walls comprise the water-soluble film, andwherein the first composition comprises a first cleaning active, and wherein the second composition comprises a second cleaning active and wherein the first and second cleaning actives are incompatible with one another. A second aspect of the present invention is a method of laundry comprising the step of adding a unit dose article according to the present invention to the drum of an automatic laundry washing machine. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Multicompartment Unit Dose Article The present invention is to a multicompartment water-soluble unit dose article comprising a water-soluble film, wherein a first compartment comprises a first composition and a second compartment comprises a second composition. The unit dose article comprises a top wall, a bottom wall, an inner wall and an outer wall and the walls comprise the water soluble film. The unit dose article may be formed from a single water soluble film or from more than one water-soluble film. The unit dose article may comprise two water soluble films. The first film may be moulded so as to define the bottom wall and the inner and outer walls of the unit dose article, and the second film is used to define the top wall of the compartment. Alternatively the first film may define the bottom wall and at least partially the bottom wall and the inner and outer walls and the second film defines the top wall and at least partially the inner and outer walls. The first and second films are sealed together. Any suitable sealing means may be used, including, but not limited to, heat sealing, solvent sealing, pressure sealing, ultrasonic sealing, pressure sealing, laser sealing or a combination thereof. The outer wall at least partially surrounds the inner wall. In other words, the outer wall substantially follows the contours of the inner wall, such that the internal space between the inner and outer wall and the top and bottom walls defines second compartment. Preferably, the outer wall completely surrounds the inner wall, such that the second compartment is formed completely around the circumference of the first compartment. However, the first compartment is not orientated completely within the internal volume of the second compartment. The second compartment may have a generally tubular shape that surrounds the first compartment. At least part of the inner wall may define the first and second compartments. By this, we herein mean that the full height of the inner wall does not need to define the first and second compartments. In other words, part of the height of the inner wall may not define either compartment and/or be in contact with either the first or second compositions. The outer wall may remain substantially equidistant to the inner wall along the full length of the inner wall. In other words, the distance between the outer wall and inner wall remains constant along the entire length of the inner wall, such that the peripheral shape of the outer wall follows the peripheral shape of the inner wall. Or in other words, the shape of the second compartment follows the shape of the first compartment. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the shape of the second compartment, i.e. wherein it forms a perimeter around the first compartment, adds structural rigidity to the unit dose article. This is because the two compartments cannot move about a flexible ‘bridge’ region. It was also surprisingly found that the unit dose article was more resistant to rupture of the film. This was because the orientation of the compartments of the present invention better balanced the load of the compositions. Where a bridge region is present, the weight of one compartment can put undue load pressure on the film causing it to overstretch and rupture. The top and bottom walls of the first and second compartments are in contact with the external environment. Therefore the first and second compartments are not superposed upon one another. The inner wall may comprise a first inner wall and a second inner wall. The first inner wall has a first side and a second side, and the second inner wall has a first side and a second side, and the entire length of one side of the first inner wall is facing the second inner wall. The first inner wall and the second inner wall may have the same or a different height. The first inner wall is contact with the first compartment and the second inner wall is in contact with the second compartment. The first inner wall and the second inner wall may be at least partially in contact with one another. The first inner wall and the second inner wall maybe completely in contact with one another. The first inner wall and the second inner wall may be sealed together. The first inner wall and the second inner wall may be at least partially separated from one another. For example, there may be a gap between the first inner wall and the second inner wall. Therefore, the first inner wall the second inner wall together define the separation between the first and second compartments. If the first inner wall and the second inner wall are separated by a gap, then the gap may be between 1 micron and 5 mm, or even between 50 microns and 2 mm or even between 100 microns and 1 mm. Preferably, the outer wall completely surrounds the inner wall, such that the second compartment is formed completely around the circumference of the first compartment. However, the first compartment is not orientated completely within the internal volume of the second compartment. The second compartment may have a generally tubular shape that surrounds the first compartment. The top wall and the bottom walls of both compartments are in contact with the external environment. The first inner wall and the second inner wall may be defined by the same or a different film. The top wall and the first inner wall may be defined by a first film and the second inner wall and the bottom wall by a second film. Alternatively, the bottom wall and the first and the second inner walls may be defined by a first film and the top wall defined by a second film. Alternatively, a first film may define the top wall and at least part of the first inner and second inner walls, and a second film may define the bottom and at least part of the first inner and second inner walls. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it may be advantageous to have a first and second inner wall in order to minimise migration of ingredients from one compartment to the other. For example, water in the composition of one compartment may migrate into the other compartment, This is especially disadvantageous if the cleaning active in one compartment is bleach for example, and/or the composition in one compartment is a powder. The first compartment may have any suitable shape. For example, the first compartment may be substantially square, rectangular, circular, elliptical, superelliptical or oval shape. By ‘substantially’, we herein mean that the general shape of the compartment is square, rectangular, circular, elliptical, superelliptical or oval shape, but the shape of the compartment may have imperfections such as small indents or protrusions. The unit dose article has a height, a length and a width, wherein the maximum height is between 1 and 5 cm, or even between 1 and 4 cm, the maximum length is between 2 and 8 cm, or even between 3 and 7 cm, and the maximum width is between 2 and 8 cm or even between 3 and 7 cm. The maximum of any of these dimensions is meant to mean the greatest distance between two points on opposite sides of the unit dose article. In other words, the unit dose article may not have straight sides and so may have variable lengths, widths and heights depending on where the measurement is taken. Therefore, the maximum should be measured at any two points that are the furthest apart from each other. The unit dose article may excess material present as a flange or skirt at the point where two or more films are sealed together. This flange or skirt may be included or may not be included in the maximum length, width and height. The unit dose article has a maximum height, a maximum length, and a maximum width, and the first compartment has a maximum height, a maximum length and a maximum width. Preferably, the ratio of the maximum height of the first compartment to the maximum height of the unit dose article is between 1:2 and 2:1; the ratio of the maximum length of the first compartment to the maximum length of the unit dose article is between 1:1.5 to 1:3; the ratio of the maximum width of the first compartment to the maximum width of the unit dose article is between 1:1.5 to 1:3. The ratio of the maximum height of the second compartment to the maximum height of the unit dose article may be between 1:2 and 2:1; the ratio of the maximum length of the second compartment to the maximum length of the unit dose article may be between 1:1.5 to 1:3; the ratio of the maximum width of the second compartment to the maximum width of the unit dose article may be between 1:1.5 to 1:3. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it was surprisingly found that the orientation of the first and second compartments such that the second compartment surrounds the first compartment improved the structural integrity of the unit dose article. In other words it was perceived by consumers to be less ‘floppy’. However, it still fulfilled the purpose of allowing the separation of incompatible ingredients during storage. Preferably, the unit dose article ruptures between 10 seconds and 5 minutes once the unit dose article has been added to 950 ml of deionised water at 20-21° C. in a 1 L beaker, wherein the water is stirred at 350 rpm with a 5 cm magnetic stirrer bar. By rupture, we herein mean the film is seen to visibly break or split. Shortly after the film breaks or splits the internal liquid detergent composition may be seen to exit the unit dose article into the surrounding water. The unit dose article comprises a first composition and a second composition. The first composition is comprised in the first compartment and the second composition is comprised in the second compartment. The composition can be of any suitable form including but not limited to liquid, powder, gel, paste, dispersion, fluid or a mixture thereof. The first and second compositions may be of the same form or of different forms. The first composition may be a powder and the second composition may be a liquid. Alternatively the first composition may be a liquid and the second composition a powder. Alternatively, the first composition may be a liquid and the second composition may be a liquid. The pH of any liquid composition may be between 5 and 9, preferably between 6 and 8. Preferably, the liquid composition comprises between 0.5% and 30%, or even between 1% and 20%, or even between 2% and 15% by weight of the liquid composition of water. Preferably the unit dose article comprises between 0.5% and 30%, or even between 1% and 20%, or even between 2% and 15% by weight of the unit dose article. If a powder composition is present then preferably in comprises glycerol. Without wishing to be bound by theory, glycerol is a plasticizer for the water-soluble film. The powder composition may draw the glycerol away from the film so detrimentally affecting the plasticity, and hence the structural integrity and rigidity. Glycerol present in the powder can prevent the transfer of glycerol from the film as an equilibrium may be obtained between the film and the powder whilst still maintaining a sufficient concentration of glycerol in the film. The weight ratio of the first composition to the second composition in the unit dose article is from 3:1 to 1:3. The first composition comprises a first cleaning active and the second composition comprises a second cleaning active and the first and second cleaning actives are incompatible with one another. By ‘incompatible’ we herein mean the ingredients would interact we each other in a detrimental manner, for example they may react such that one or both are broken down. This means that one or both ingredients are not available during the wash process to provide their respective benefits. Those skilled in the art will recognize suitable incompatible ingredients to be the first and second cleaning actives. Without wishing to be bound by theory it may be preferred that one of the compositions is in powder form. This has the added benefit of increasing the dissolution time of the powder composition when it interacts with water versus the liquid composition and so reduces the potential interaction of the incompatible actives at the point they are released from the unit dose article. At the point of release there may exist high concentrations of the cleaning compositions in the wash liquor, before they are dispersed throughout the wash liquor. By slowing the dissolution of one of the actives, there is less chance of the incompatible actives negatively interacting in the area of temporary high concentration. If one of the compositions is a liquid, then preferably the liquid composition comprises a gelling agent or a structurant. Those skilled in the art will recognize suitable gelling or structurant agents. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the presence of a gelling agent or a structurant may help to ‘lock away’ any free water and reduce the chances of it migrating into the other compartment, especially if the other compartment comprises a powder composition. If one of the compositions is a powder, then preferably the powder composition comprises a desiccating agent. Those skilled on the art will recognize suitable desiccating agents. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the desiccating agent will help remove free water that could otherwise interact with the cleaning active, especially if the cleaning active is a bleach for example. The unit dose article may be a thermoformed unit dose article. Preferably, the film is thermoformed such that the film of the resultant unit dose article retains a degree of flexibility or elasticity such that it allows referred structural integrity. If the film is too rigid then it may break/split due to the internal forces provided by the compositions. Preferably the first cleaning active retains an activity of at least 25%, or even 50% or even 75% after 8 weeks storage. Preferably the second cleaning active retains an activity of at least 25%, or even 50% or even 75% after 8 weeks storage. ‘Storage’ is understood to begin at the point when the unit dose article is formed. The unit dose article may be a laundry unit dose article or a household care unit dose article. Suitable laundry unit dose articles include laundry cleaning articles including laundry detergent articles, laundry pre-treat articles, or laundry treatment articles including laundry care articles, laundry freshness articles, laundry softening articles or mixtures thereof. Suitable household care articles include automatic dishwashing articles, hard surface cleaner articles, hand wash articles and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the unit dose article is a laundry cleaning article. First Composition The first composition comprises a first cleaning active. The first cleaning active can be any suitable cleaning active that is incompatible with the second cleaning active. The first cleaning active may be selected from bleach, enzymes, surfactant, polymers, perfumes or a mixture thereof. The first cleaning active may be selected from bleach, enzymes and a mixture thereof. The first cleaning active may be bleach. The first cleaning active may be an enzyme. The first composition may be a powder, and the first cleaning active may be selected from bleach, enzymes, surfactant, polymers, perfumes or a mixture thereof, preferably selected from bleach, enzymes and a mixture thereof. The first composition may be a powder and the first cleaning active an enzyme, a bleach or a mixture thereof. Without wishing to be bound by theory, this is preferable as the powder composition is more likely to release first. This means that the bleach and enzymes are released first and have the opportunity to provide cleaning benefit to the fabrics first into the wash liquor during the wash process. This has the advantage that the enzymes and bleach are not concentrated in the wash liquor to react with other ingredients including the second cleaning active, rather the majority of the enzyme and/or bleach is available to act on the fabrics. This also means that the majority of the other cleaning actives are available to act on the fabrics and not react with the enzyme and/or bleach. The first composition may be substantially free of the second cleaning active, in other words, the second cleaning active is present only in the first composition. By ‘substantially free’ we herein mean the second cleaning active is not intentionally added to the first composition. The first composition may comprise any further adjunct cleaning ingredients. Second Composition The second composition comprises a second cleaning active. The second cleaning active can be any suitable cleaning active that is incompatible with the first cleaning active. The second cleaning active may be selected from surfactant, polymers, perfumes, bleach, enzymes or a mixture thereof. The second cleaning active may be selected from surfactant, polymers, perfumes and a mixture thereof. The second composition may be a liquid, and the second cleaning active may be selected from surfactant, polymers, perfumes, bleach, enzymes or a mixture thereof, preferably selected from surfactant, polymers, perfumes and a mixture thereof. The second composition may be substantially free of the first cleaning active, in other words, the first cleaning active is present only in the second composition. By ‘substantially free’ we herein mean the first cleaning active is not intentionally added to the second composition. The second composition may comprise any further adjunct cleaning ingredients. Bleach may be present in either composition or both compositions. Bleach may be present in powder or liquid compositions, preferably powder compositions. Suitable bleaching agents include photobleaches, bleach activators, hydrogen peroxide, sources of hydrogen peroxide, pre-formed peracids, bleach catalysts and mixtures thereof. In general, when a bleaching agent is used, the composition may comprise from about 0.1% to about 50% or even from about 0.1% to about 25% bleaching agent by weight of the composition. Examples of suitable bleaching agents include: (1) photobleaches for example sulfonated zinc phthalocyanine;(2) preformed peracids: Suitable preformed peracids include, but are not limited to, compounds selected from the group consisting of percarboxylic acids and salts, percarbonic acids and salts, perimidic acids and salts, peroxymonosulfuric acids and salts, for example, Oxzone®, and mixtures thereof. Suitable percarboxylic acids include hydrophobic and hydrophilic peracids having the formula R—(C═O)O—O—M wherein R is an alkyl group, optionally branched, having, when the peracid is hydrophobic, from 6 to 14 carbon atoms, or from 8 to 12 carbon atoms and, when the peracid is hydrophilic, less than 6 carbon atoms or even less than 4 carbon atoms; and M is a counterion, for example, sodium, potassium or hydrogen;(3) sources of hydrogen peroxide, for example, inorganic perhydrate salts, including alkali metal salts such as sodium salts of perborate (usually mono- or tetra-hydrate), percarbonate, persulphate, perphosphate, persilicate salts and mixtures thereof. In one aspect of the invention the inorganic perhydrate salts are selected from the group consisting of sodium salts of perborate, percarbonate and mixtures thereof. When employed, inorganic perhydrate salts are typically present in amounts of from 0.05 to 40 wt %, or 1 to 30 wt % of the overall composition and are typically incorporated into such compositions as a crystalline solid that may be coated. Suitable coatings include, inorganic salts such as alkali metal silicate, carbonate or borate salts or mixtures thereof, or organic materials such as water-soluble or dispersible polymers, waxes, oils or fatty soaps; and(4) bleach activators having R—(C═O)-L wherein R is an alkyl group, optionally branched, having, when the bleach activator is hydrophobic, from 6 to 14 carbon atoms, or from 8 to 12 carbon atoms and, when the bleach activator is hydrophilic, less than 6 carbon atoms or even less than 4 carbon atoms; and L is leaving group. Examples of suitable leaving groups are benzoic acid and derivatives thereof—especially benzene sulphonate. Suitable bleach activators include dodecanoyl oxybenzene sulphonate, decanoyl oxybenzene sulphonate, decanoyl oxybenzoic acid or salts thereof, 3,5,5-trimethyl hexanoyloxybenzene sulphonate, tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED) and nonanoyloxybenzene sulphonate (NOBS). Suitable bleach activators are also disclosed in WO 98/17767. While any suitable bleach activator may be employed, in one aspect of the invention the subject cleaning composition may comprise NO. Preferably the bleach comprises percarbonate. Also preferred are bleaches comprising coated percarbonate and coated or uncoated PAP or coated percarbonate and coated or uncoated DAP. The composition may comprise coated bleach particles. The particles are coated preferably with a compound selected from the group comprising sodium sulphate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium silicate or mixtures thereof. In one aspect, the particles are coated with an efflorescent material, preferably with sulphate or citrate, more preferably with sodium sulphate. The bleach particles comprise at least 3%, or at least 4% or at least 5% by weight of the particle of coating, preferably from about 5% to about 20%, more preferably from about 6% to about 15% and especially from about 7% to about 12% by weight of the particle of a coating, preferably an efflorescent material. Inorganic and organic bleaches are suitable bleaches for use herein. Inorganic bleaches include perhydrate salts such as perborate, percarbonate, perphosphate, persulfate and persilicate salts. The inorganic perhydrate salts are normally the alkali metal salts. Alkali metal percarbonates, particularly sodium percarbonate are preferred perhydrates for use herein. The percarbonate is incorporated into the products in a coated form which provides in-product stability and anti-caking properties. The literature describes a large number of materials that can be used as coating for bleach, however the literature does not address the problem of caking of bleach particles or temperature cycle stable bleach particles (i.e. bleach particles capable of withstand temperature changes). For the present invention the bleach needs to be coated with efflorescent material, preferably with sulphate or citrate, more preferably with sodium sulphate. The coating can comprise other materials but preferably the coating comprises less than 40%, more preferably less than 20% and even more preferably less than 10% and especially less than 1% by weight of the coating of other materials, i.e., preferably the coating consist essentially of efflorescent materials, more preferably the coating consist essentially of sodium sulphate. Especially preferred for use herein are percarbonate particles comprising a core substantially consisting of bleach, preferably sodium percarbonate, and a coating layer enclosing this core comprising an efflorescent material, preferably sodium sulphate. The core can be produced by fluidised bed spray granulation and the coating layer can be obtainable by spraying an aqueous efflorescent material, preferably sodium sulphate solution onto the uncoated particles of bleach. The fluidised bed temperature is from 35 to 100° C. to allow for water evaporation. In the case in which the efflorescent material is sodium sulphate, the fluidised bed temperature during application of the coating layer is maintained above the transition temperature of the decahydrate (32.4° C.). In a further aspect the bleach particles can be coated bleach particles comprising a core and at least two coating layers. Specifically, the coated bleach particles can comprise an inner layer of efflorescent materials at least partially enclosing the core and firmly adhering thereto, and an outer layer of water-insoluble materials at least partially enclosing the inner layer and firmly adhering thereto. In one embodiment, the bleach particle comprises a core substantially consisting of bleach, in one embodiment sodium percarbonate; an inner layer comprising efflorescent materials; and an outer layer substantially comprising water-insoluble materials, in one embodiment, sodium silicate. Coated bleach particles comprise a core substantially consisting of bleach. In one embodiment, the core substantially consists of sodium percarbonate. The term “substantially” is taken to mean that, as a result of the production process, the core may contain small quantities of auxiliary substances, i.e. substances other than bleach. The auxiliary substances may be present in an amount of less than 10%, in another embodiment less than 5%, in another embodiment less than 1%, by weight of the core. The auxiliary substances may be active oxygen stabilisers, for example, silicates and/or magnesium compounds. The auxiliary substances may also be inorganic or organic compounds which are used as nuclei in fluidised bed spray granulation for the production of sodium percarbonate, for example, the production of soda. In one embodiment, the coated bleach particles comprise an inner layer of efflorescent materials at least partially enclosing the core and firmly adhering thereto. The inner layer substantially consists of an efflorescent material which may be partially hydrated. Suitable efflorescent materials include sodium sulphate, sodium carbonate, and mixtures thereof. The bleach particle of the invention does not need a thick inner layer in order to provide stability benefits. In one embodiment, the inner layer is from about 2% to about 10%, in another embodiment from about 3% to about 8%, by weight of the total bleach particle. In one embodiment, the coated bleach particles comprise an outer layer of water-insoluble materials at least partially enclosing the inner layer and firmly adhering thereto. The outer coating layer substantially consists of a water-insoluble material. Suitable water-insoluble materials include alkali metal silicate, in one embodiment, sodium silicate. Said sodium silicate has a silicate ratio of from about 2.5 to about 4.5, in another embodiment from about 2.9 to about 4, and in another embodiment from about 3 to about 3.4. By “water-insoluble” it is meant a material that has a solubility of less than 0.01 g/cm3 at a temperature of about 20° C. In one embodiment, the outer layer comprises from about 0.2% to about 1.5 wt. %, in another embodiment from about 0.5% to 1 wt. % sodium silicate. It is believed that the outer layer of water-insoluble materials, in one embodiment silicate, offers sufficient encapsulation to provide stability benefits while also containing large enough defects in the outer layer that the bleach (in one embodiment, percarbonate), is released into the wash liquor in a desirable timeframe. In one embodiment, greater than 80% of the core substantially comprising bleach is released in less than 10 minutes, in another embodiment less than 7 minutes into the wash liquor. Too thick of an outer layer delays release of the core (and therefore diminishes bleach performance) whereas too thin of an outer layer will not provide the stability benefits in the detergent composition. In one embodiment, the water-insoluble outer layer is a thermally sensitive material that is solid at room temperature but melts in the temperature range of from about 30° C. to about 60° C., in another embodiment from about 35° C. to about 45° C. The outer layer can provide protection from water ingress during storage while being able to release the bleach core under typical automatic dishwashing wash conditions (40° C. to about 60° C. wash cycles). Preparation of the coated bleach particles comprises coating processes which are known in the art; in one embodiment, fluidized bed coating. Fluidized bed coating is characterized in that for the preparation of an outer shell layer comprising, for example alkali metal silicate, an aqueous solution containing alkali metal silicate with an alkali metal silicate concentration in the range from about 2% to about 20 wt. %, and a silicate ratio of greater than 2.5, is used. This solution is sprayed onto, for example, sodium percarbonate particles which have at least one inner layer comprising an efflorescent material. The spraying is carried out in a fluidized bed, with simultaneous evaporation of water, until the outer layer comprises from about 0.2% to about 1.5 wt. % alkali metal silicate. So that good stabilising may be achieved, endeavours are taken during production to obtain a stabilized coated bleach particle having the lowest possible degree of hydration. For this reason, the fluidised bed temperature during application of the inner layer to the core and the outer layer to the inner layer is maintained above the transition temperature of the decahydrate (32.4° C.). The resulting coated bleach particle has a weight geometric mean particle size of from about 400 μm to about 1200 μm, in one embodiment from about 500 μm to about 1000 μm, and in another embodiment from about 700 μm to about 900 μm. It is beneficial that the bleach particles have a low level of fine and coarse particles; in one embodiment less than 10% by weight of the bleach particles have a size above about 1400 μm, in another embodiment above 1200 μm or below about 400 μm, in another embodiment below about 200 μm. The mean particle size and particle size distribution further contributes to the stability of the detergent composition. In one embodiment, the coated bleach particle has a weight geometric mean particle size of from about 700 to about 1000 μm, with less than about 3% by weight of the bleach particle above about 1180 μm and less than about 5% by weight of the bleach particle below about 200 μm. The weight geometric mean particle size can be measured using a Malvern particle size analyser based on laser diffraction. The detergent composition comprises from about 3% to about 30%, in another embodiment from about 5% to about 20%, and in another embodiment from about 7% to about 15%, bleach particle by weight of the composition. The bleach can be coated using a plurality of processes, for example by coating in a fluidised bed. Details of the process are found at EP 862 842 A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,113,805. Potassium peroxymonopersulfate is another inorganic perhydrate salt of utility herein. Typical organic bleaches are organic peroxyacids including diacyl and tetraacylperoxides, especially diperoxydodecanedioc acid, diperoxytetradecanedioc acid, and diperoxyhexadecanedioc acid. Dibenzoyl peroxide is a preferred organic peroxyacid herein. Mono- and diperazelaic acid, mono- and diperbrassylic acid, and Nphthaloylaminoperoxicaproic acid are also suitable herein. The diacyl peroxide, especially dibenzoyl peroxide, should preferably be present in the form of particles having a weight average diameter of from about 0.1 to about 100 microns, preferably from about 0.5 to about 30 microns, more preferably from about 1 to about 10 microns. Preferably, at least about 25%, more preferably at least about 50%, even more preferably at least about 75%, most preferably at least about 90%, of the particles are smaller than 10 microns, preferably smaller than 6 microns. Diacyl peroxides within the above particle size range have also been found to provide better stain removal especially from plastic dishware, while minimizing undesirable deposition and filming during use in automatic dishwashing machines, than larger diacyl peroxide particles. The preferred diacyl peroxide particle size thus allows the formulator to obtain good stain removal with a low level of diacyl peroxide, which reduces deposition and filming. Conversely, as diacyl peroxide particle size increases, more diacyl peroxide is needed for good stain removal, which increases deposition on surfaces encountered during the dishwashing process. Further typical organic bleaches include the peroxy acids, particular examples being the alkylperoxy acids and the arylperoxy acids. Preferred representatives are (a) peroxybenzoic acid and its ring-substituted derivatives, such as alkylperoxybenzoic acids, but also peroxy-α-naphthoic acid and magnesium monoperphthalate, (b) the aliphatic or substituted aliphatic peroxy acids, such as peroxylauric acid, peroxystearic acid, ε-phthalimidoperoxycaproic acid[phthaloiminoperoxyhexanoic acid (PAP)], o-carboxybenzamidoperoxycaproic acid, N-nonenylamidoperadipic acid and N-nonenylamidopersuccinates, and (c) aliphatic and araliphatic peroxydicarboxylic acids, such as 1,12-diperoxycarboxylic acid, 1,9-diperoxyazelaic acid, diperoxysebacic acid, diperoxybrassylic acid, the diperoxyphthalic acids, 2-decyldiperoxybutane-1,4-dioic acid, N,N-terephthaloyldi(6-aminopercaproic acid). Preferably, the bleach coated particles have a weight geometric mean particle size of from about 300 μm to about 1200 μm, more preferably from about 400 μm to about 1000 μm and especially from about 500 μm to about 900 μm. Preferably the bleach coated particles have low level of fines and coarse particles, in particular less than 10% by weight of the particles are above about 1400, more preferably about 1200 or below about 200, more preferably about 100 μm. These mean particle size and particle size distribution further contribute to the excellent processing properties of the composition of the invention.

EXAMPLES The benefit of a unit dose article according to the present invention was tested versus one outside of the scope. A liquid composition was prepared in a 1 L beaker, stirred at 250 rpm with a 10 cm diameter impeller. The liquid composition comprised; 6.31 wt % water13.81 wt % 1,2-Propanediol5.67 wt % Glycerol20.54 wt % MEA-linear alkylbenzene sulphonate10.04 wt % ethoxylated alkyl sulphate with an average degree of ethoxylation of 314.84 wt % ethoxylated aftty alcohol ethoxylate with an average degree of ethoxylation of 70.75 wt % citric acid6.97 wt % fatty acid2.38 wt % HEDP6.13 wt % ethoxylated polyethylene imine0.0585 wt % protease (54.4 mg/g)0.09 wt % sodium formate0.62 wt % minors0.36 wt % MgCl2 0.11 wt % K2SO3 1.81 wt % perfume0.018 wt % brightener 499.49 wt % monoethanolamine A powder composition was then prepared comprising 0.15 g TAED and 1.05 g sodium percarbonate. A first unit dose article was then prepared by deforming a piece of M8630 film (commercial available from Monosol) in a mould having a geometry according to the present invention for 10 seconds and then applying a vaccum at 400 mBar. Into the larger outer compartment, 30 ml of the powder was added using a 5 ml syringe. In the smaller inner compartment the powder was added using a spatula. A water based solvent was then applied to the seal area and a second film was used to close the unit dose article and sealed for 17 seconds at 120° C. A second unit dose article was then prepared having a first and a second compartment wherein the compartments were arranged next to one another but wherein the first compartment did not surround the second compartment. This the two compartments faced one another along one side of each compartment only. The first film was prepared as above in an appropriate mold and 22 ml of the liquid composition added to a first compartment. This lower volume was necessary due to the difference in compartment size which was a consequence of the geometry of the unit dose article. To the second compartment, the powder was added together with 2 g of carbonate as a filler. This was added again due to difference in compartment volume due to the geometry of the unit dose articles. A second film was added and the unit dose article sealed as described above. A third unit dose article was prepared in the same way as the first unit dose article, but comprised 2.24 g sodium HEDP in the powder compartment instead of the powder of the first unit dose article. A fourth unit dose article was prepared in the same way as the second unit dose article, but comprised 2.24 g sodium HEDP and 2.05 g carbonate filler in the powder compartment instead of the powder of the second unit dose article. A fifth unit dose article was prepared in the same way as the first unit dose article but comprised 1.05 g of a 15% active hueing dye instead of the powder of the first unit dose article. A sixth unit dose article was prepared in the same way as the second unit dose article but comprised 1.05 g of a 15% active hueing dye and 0.5 g carbonate instead of the powder of the second unit dose article.
