Step 3: preparation of intermediate tert butyl 7-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (6c)
To a solution of tert-butyl 7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (6b) (49.4 g, 193 mmol) in toluene (2140 mL) under inert atmosphere was added N-allyloxy-2-nitro-benzenesulfonamide (49.84 g, 193 mmol), PPh3 (50.62 g, 193 mmol) and DTA (50.15 g, 218 mmol) portionwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at rt. The precipitate was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (petroleum ether/acetone 100/0 to 60/40) to give tert-butyl 7-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (6c) (80 g, 161.1 mmol, 83%) as a yellow oil.
