Step D: 7-Bromo-2-cyclopropyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a cooled (−70° C.) solution of 2-cyclopropyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-c]pyridine (101 mg, 0.447 mmol) in THF (1 mL) was added n-butyllithium (2.27 M in n-hexane, 260 μL, 0.590 mmol). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to −40° C. and stirred for 30 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to −70° C. and bromine (30 μL, 0.583 mmol) in THF (600 μL) was added. The temperature was maintained at −70° C. for 1 h and then at rt for 21 h. The reaction was quenched with sat. aq. NH4Cl (1 mL) and the solvents removed in vacuo. The residue was taken up in DCM (50 mL) and the organic layer was washed with water (30 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 50% DCM/hexanes) afforded the title compound (54 mg, 39%) as a yellow solid.
