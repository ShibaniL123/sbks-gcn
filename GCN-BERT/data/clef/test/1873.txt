TECHNICAL FIELD The subject matter disclosed herein relates generally to gaming machines and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for allowing players to play a wagering game with a bonus game including a skill-based target game. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION At least some known gaming machines display video based wagering game such as bingo-type games that allow players to play a game and wager on the outcome of the game. During play of known video bingo-type games, the player purchases one or more bingo-type cards for use in playing the bingo-type game. Each bingo card includes a randomly selected sub-set of numbers from a pre-defined set of numbers. The gaming machine conducts a draw wherein the gaming machine randomly selects a plurality of numbers from the predefined set of numbers. During the draw, the gaming machine or the player compare the drawn number with the numbers displayed on the player's bingo cards to determine if a match occurs on the bingo cards. The player and/or gaming machine mark, or daub, each corresponding number on the player's card matching a selected number. The gaming machine provides an award to the player if a predefined number of matches occur in the player's card and/or if the matched numbers form a predefined pattern on the player's card. Over time, during game play, the player may become frustrated because the chances of receiving an award are based only on the number of matches made between the numbers selected during the draw and the predefined set of numbers displayed in the player's bingo card. Accordingly, new features are necessary to appeal to player interest and enhance excitement in order to entice longer play and increased profitability. The present invention is directed to satisfying these needs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference to the drawings and in operation, the invention overcomes at least some of the disadvantages of known gaming machines by providing, among other things, systems and methods which enable a player to place a wager on a skill-based game and receive an award that may be used to place a wager on another non-skill based game. For example, the system and methods of the invention are configured to allow the player to play a bingo-type wagering game that includes a bonus feature skill-based game and that allows the player to receive an enhanced award based on the outcome of the skill-based game. More specifically, the system and methods of the present invention allow the player to place a wager on the outcome of the skill-based game and interact with the skill-based game to affect the game outcome, and provide an award to the player based on the outcome of the skill-based game and the player's wager. In addition, the player may place a wager on the bingo-type game using the award provided in the skill-based game. By providing a bingo-type game that includes a bonus feature skill-based game that provides an award to the player that may be used for wagering on the bingo-type game, the player's expectation for achieving a win is increased and the enjoyment of the game is improved. Thus, the amount of time that the game is played by patrons of a gaming establishment is thereby increased. The invention is generally directed to systems and methods to promote and enhance game play by allowing a player to place a wager on a primary game such as, for example, a bingo-type game, receive an award based on the outcome of the primary game, and allow a player to play a secondary skill-based game and to receive an award based on the outcome of the secondary skill-based game that may be used to wager on the primary game. In some embodiments, the present invention includes system 10 that displays a bingo-type game, allows a player to make a wager associated with the bingo-type game, randomly generates an outcome of the bingo-type game and provides a primary game award to the player as a function of the bingo-type game outcome. The system 10 may also display a secondary skill-based game that includes a plurality of targets and a plurality of player-selectable items that are used to contact one or more targets. The system 10 allows the player to select an item and to select a movement associated with the item, and determines an outcome of the secondary skill-based game based on the player selected item and movement. The system 10 then displays the secondary skill-based game outcome including a simulated movement of the selected item in which the selected item is displayed as either contacting a target or not contacting a target. In one embodiment, the system 10 provides a secondary award of wagering credits to the player based on the secondary skill-based game outcome and allows the player to place a wager on the bingo-type game using the secondary award wagering credits. In some embodiments, the skill-based game may include any game that allows the player to affect the outcome of the skill-based game through a series of player choices and/or player selections. The skill-based game may also include a player skill component associated with the player's selection that may include physical or manual dexterity, digital dexterity, hand-eye coordination (e.g., aim), reflexes, memory, cognitive processing, knowledge, and/or strategy-based selection. Skill-based games may include, but are not limited to including, target shooting games, catapult-type games, sporting games, memory games, matching games, and/or any suitable game that includes a skill component and that enables the outcome of the game to be at least partially determined based on a players selection.

In the illustrated embodiment, in method step 202, the gaming controller 18 allows a player to make a wager associated with a primary wagering game 60 and responsively displays the primary wagering game 60 on the display device 14. In step 204, the gaming controller 18 randomly generates an outcome of the primary wagering game 60 and provides a primary game award to the player as a function of the primary wagering game outcome. In one embodiment, the primary wagering game 60 is the video bingo-type game 60. However, it should be noted that the wagering game 60 may be any type of game upon which a player could make a wager including, but not limited to a slot game, a blackjack game, a video poker game, or any type of game that enables the gaming machine 12 to function as described herein. In general, during play of the primary wagering game 60, the gaming controller 18 displays the game including one or more bingo cards 74. Each bingo card 74 includes a plurality game symbols 76 selected from a predefined set of game symbols 76. In one embodiment, the plurality of game symbols 76 may include numbers. Alternatively, the plurality of game symbols 76 may include any symbol that may be selected from a predefined set of associated symbols. In the illustrated embodiment, each bingo card 74 includes a plurality of game symbols 76 displayed in a grid 78 and arranged along a plurality of rows 80 and a plurality of columns 82. In the illustrated embodiment, the gaming controller 18 displays the game 60 including a plurality of bingo cards 74 determined as a function of the player's wager. More specifically, the gaming controller 18 receives a wager from the player and receives a player selection input indicative of a number of bingo cards to be purchased with the wager for use in the bingo-type game 60, and displays the selected number of bingo cards 74. In the illustrated embodiment, each bingo card 74 displays a total of 15 game symbols 76 displayed within the grid 78 arranged in 3 rows 80 and 5 columns 82 in a “3×5” arrangement. Alternatively, any number of symbols 76 may be displayed in any suitable grid arrangement including, for example, 20 game symbols 76 displayed in a 4×5 arrangement, 25 game symbols 76 displayed in a 5×5 arrangement, and/or any suitable number of game symbols 76 displayed in any suitable row 80 and column 82 combination to enable the gaming controller 18 to function as described herein. In addition, the grid 78 may be displayed with a plurality of shapes such as, for example, a rectangle, a square, a diamond, a circle, and/or any suitable shape that enables the gaming controller 18 to function as described herein. Each bingo game is generally played in a conventional manner. The player makes a wager, which may be based on a predetermined denomination and a selected number of bingo cards 74 to be selected by the player and/or a selected number of game symbols 76, and initiates a symbol draw operation. During the symbol draw operation, the gaming controller 18 randomly selects a plurality of game symbols 76 from the predefined set of game symbols 76 and sequentially displays each selected game symbol 76 on the display device 14. In one embodiment, the gaming controller 18 may compare the game symbols 76 displayed on each selected bingo card 74 with each drawn game symbol 76, and identify (shown as an “X” in FIG. 4) each bingo card symbol 76 that matches the drawn game symbol 76. In another embodiment, the player may identify the matched bingo card symbol 76. The gaming controller 18 determines an outcome of the game 60 based on the matched symbols 76 and provides an award to the player based on the matched symbols, the wager, and a predetermined paytable. For example, the gaming controller 18 may provide an award to the player based on a predefined pattern formed by the matched symbols 76 on a bingo card 74 and/or a predefined number of matched symbols 76 on one or more bingo cards 74. Moreover, the gaming controller 18 may also determine a type of game symbol that is matched and provide an award if the matched symbol types are associated with a predefined symbol type. In general, the term “award” may be a payout, in terms of credits or money. Thus, the gaming controller 18 may award a regular payout in response to the outcome of the wagering game 60. However, it should be noted that the term award may also refer to other types of awards, including, prizes, e.g., meals, show tickets, etc. . . . , as well as in-game award, such as free games, bonus symbols, and/or special game modes. Many variations to the above described general play of a bingo-type game fall within the scope of the present invention. Such bingo games are well-known in the art, and are therefore not further discussed. In method step 206, the gaming controller 18 displays a secondary skill-based game 62 on the display device 14. In one embodiment, the gaming controller 18 determines if a triggering condition occurs in the primary game outcome and responsively displays the secondary skill-based game 62 based on the occurrence of the triggering condition. For example, in one embodiment, the gaming controller 18 may determine an amount of wagering credits accumulated by the player during a gaming session and/or during play of the primary game 60, and determine the triggering condition to occur if the amount of wagering credits is greater than, or equal to, a predefined amount of wagering credits. In another embodiment, the gaming controller 18 may define the triggering condition as a predefined amount of wagering credits placed as a wager during the primary game 60. In another embodiment, the gaming controller 18 may define the triggering condition as an appearance of a special symbol in the primary game outcome. In the illustrated embodiment, the secondary skill-based game 62 is a target based game and includes a plurality of targets 64 and a plurality of player-selectable items 70 for use in contacting (such as impacting, knocking down, and/or destroying) the plurality of targets 64. Alternatively, the secondary skill-based game 62 may include a game that includes a player skill component associated with a player's input and that determines an outcome of the game based at least in part on the player skill component. In the illustrated embodiment, the gaming controller 18 is configured to display the secondary skill-based game 62 including a plurality of targets 64 displayed within a playing field 66. The gaming controller 18 also displays a launching device 68 that may be used by the player to launch an item 70 from the launching device 68 towards the targets 64. Each target 64 is spaced a distance form the launching device 68 to allow the player to cause the item 70 to be moved from the launching device 68 towards the targets 64 along a item trajectory 72. In step 208, the gaming controller 18 allows the player to select at least one item 70 from the plurality of player-selectable items 70 for use in the secondary skill-based game 62. For example, as shown in FIG. 6, the gaming controller 18 may display a plurality of player selectable items 70 and allow the player to select one or more player selectable items 70. The gaming controller 18 receives a player selection input indicative of a selected item 70 and displays the selected item 70 in the secondary skill-based game 62 for use by the player. In the illustrated embodiment, each item 70 includes a corresponding simulated movement. The simulated movement may be, for example, a trajectory 72, multiple trajectories, a change in shape, a change in direction, and/or any visual characteristic that may be associated with the item 70. For example, as shown in FIG. 6, 3 items 70 may be displayed for selection by the player, including a large boulder 84, small boulders 86, and a bomb 88, each having a different trajectory 72 when launched from the launching device 68. The bomb 88 may include an additional “exploding” characteristic when contacting a target. The small boulders 86 may also separate during flight such that multiple trajectories occur when the small boulders 86 are launched, wherein each small boulder has a different trajectory. Many variations to the above described simulated movements fall within the scope of the present invention. In step 210, the gaming controller 18 allows the player to select a movement associated with the selected item 70. As shown in FIGS. 7-10, the gaming controller 18 is configured to display the launching device 68 to allow a player to manipulate the launching device 68 via player selection inputs (represented as a “finger” being swiped across the user input device 14) that correspond to the player skill component of the secondary skill-based game 62. In the illustrated embodiment, the launching device 68 includes a catapult 90 that launches the selected item 70 along the determined item trajectory 72 from a starting position 91 to an ending position 93. The catapult 90 is displayed including a base 92, a throwing arm 94 attached to the base 92, and a projectile support 98 for supporting the item 70 from the throwing arm 94. In the illustrated embodiment, each player selectable item 70 is associated with a plurality of predefined trajectories 72. The player uses a skill component in selecting a trajectory 72 to be associated with the item 70 to contact the targets 64 displayed in the playing field 66. The gaming controller 18 allows the player to select a characteristic of the catapult 90 and selects a predefined trajectory 72 based on the selected catapult characteristic. In one embodiment, the catapult characteristics may include an angle of incline 100 of the throwing arm 94 and a power of the catapult 90. For example, in one embodiment, during play of the game 62, the player may adjust an angle of incline 100 of the catapult 90 by adjusting the angle of the throwing arm 94 with respect to a horizontal axis 102. In addition, the player may adjust a launch power associated with item 70 by moving the item 70 a distance 104 along the throwing arm 94. As the player adjust the angle of incline 100 and the catapult power, the gaming controller 18 determines the trajectory 72 associated with the angle 100 and power to be used when the player releases the item 70. More specifically, the player selection module 56 receives player selection input indicative of the selected item 70, the selected incline angle 100, and the selected launch power, and determines a predefined trajectory 72 to be displayed with the item 70. Once the player has adjusted the angle of incline 100 and the launch power, the player releases the item causing the catapult 90 to hurl the item towards the targets 64 along the selected trajectory 72. In step 212, the gaming controller 18 determines an outcome of the secondary skill-based game 62 as a function of the selected item 70 and the selected item movement 72. In step 214, the gaming controller 18 displays the secondary skill-based outcome including a simulated movement of the selected item 70 in which the selected item 70 is displayed as either contacting a target 64 or not contacting a target 64. In the illustrated embodiment, the target selection module 58 selects a target 64 to be contacted by the item 70 based on the determined item trajectory 72. More specifically, the target selection module 58 receives information indicative of the determined item trajectory 72 from the player selection module 56 and determines whether a displayed target 64 is contacted by the item 70 based on the determined trajectory 72. In step 216, the gaming controller 18 provides an award to the player that is determined as a function of the secondary skill-based game outcome. More specifically, the gaming controller 18 determines whether to provide an award to the player based on the player selection input associated with the skill-based component. For example, the gaming controller 18 may provide an award to the player if the player selects an item trajectory 72 that causes the item to contact one or more targets 64. In one embodiment, the gaming machine 12 may provide an award based on the outcome of the skill-based game 62 that includes wagering credits that may be used to place a wager in the primary wagering game 60. For example, the target selection module 58 may include a paytable including a plurality of awards associated with a plurality of predefined item trajectories 72. The gaming controller 18 may determine the predefined item trajectory 72 based on player selection input and provide an award based on the selected item trajectory 72 and the award paytable. In addition, the gaming controller 18 may display each target 64 with an associated wagering credit value, determine the award based on the player selection input, and display the skill-based game outcome including displaying the selected item 70 contacting a target 64 having a credit value corresponding to the determined award. For example, the gaming controller 18 may display the item 70 contacting one target 64 having a wagering credit value equal to the determined award value. In addition, the gaming controller 18 may display the item 70 contacting a plurality of target 64 each having a wagering credit value the sum of which is equal to the determined game award. In the illustrated embodiment, the gaming controller 18 is configured to allow the player to purchase an item 70 from a plurality of player selectable items 70 and display the secondary skill-based game with the purchased item 70. For example, as shown in FIG. 11, the gaming controller 18 may display a plurality of items 70 that may be purchased by the player using wagering credits received during play of the primary game 60. The gaming controller 18 may allow the player to purchase each item 70 using gaming credits awarded during the primary game 60 and/or gaming credits stored in the credit module 50. Moreover, the gaming controller 18 may allow the player to use wager credits awarded during play of the secondary skill-based game 62 to purchase additional items 70. In one embodiment, the gaming controller 18 displays each item having a different purchased value. The gaming controller 18 may select a paytable based on the value of the item 70 purchased by the player. In addition, the gaming controller 18 may determine a number of targets 64 and/or a value of targets 64 being displayed in the secondary skill-based game 62 based on the value of the purchased item 70. For example, in one embodiment, the gaming controller 18 may select a paytable having a higher value of awards associated with each target 64 when the player purchases a higher value item 70. In addition, the gaming controller 18 may display a greater number of higher value targets 64 when the player purchases a higher value item 70, and display a greater number of lower value targets 64 when the player purchases a lower value item 70. The gaming controller 18 may also provide a predefined number of free items 70 that maybe used by the player during the skill-based game 62, and prompt the player to purchase additional items 70 when the player has played each free item 70. In the illustrated, the gaming controller 18 tracks a period of time elapsed from the display of the secondary skill-based game 62 and receiving a player selection input to initiate play of the skill-based game 62. In one embodiment, the gaming controller 18 randomly selects an item for use in the secondary skill-based game 62 if the player does not select an item 70 within a predefined period of time. More specifically, the gaming controller 18 selects an item 70 if a player selection input indicative of a player's selection of an item is not received within an elapsed predefined period of time since the display of the secondary skill-based game. In another embodiment, the gaming controller 18 may randomly select a simulated movement associated with the selected item 70 if a player selection input indicative of a player's selection of the item movement is not received within an elapsed predefined period of time since the selection of the item 70. In another embodiment, the gaming controller 18 is configured to allow a player to make a wager associated with the skill-based game 62 and provide an award determined as a function of secondary skill-based game outcome, the player's wager, and a predetermined paytable. In one embodiment, the gaming controller may allow the player to purchase at least one item from the plurality of player-selectable items using the wager and allow the player to select a movement associated with the selected item 70. The gaming controller 18 may also determine an outcome of the skill-based game as a function of the purchased item 70 and the selected item movement, and provide an award to the player as a function of the skill-based game outcome, the wager, and a paytable.
