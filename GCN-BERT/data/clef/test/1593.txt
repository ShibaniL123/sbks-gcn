Example 8
1-((2,4-Dioxo-1,3-diazaspiro[4,5]decane-8-yl)methyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
3,7-Dimethyl-1-((4-oxocyclohexyl)methyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (100 mg, 0.340 mmol) and ammonium carbonate (80.0 mg, 0.750 mmol) were dissolved in ethanol/water (1 mL / 1 mL), and sodium cyanide (35.0 mg, 0.720 mmol) in water (0.4 mL) was slowly added at room temperature. The reaction solution was heated to 50Â°C for 16 hours, cooled to room temperature and quenched by the addition of saturated sodium carbonate solution (20 mL). The reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL x 2), and the organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by preparative HPLC to give the product 1-((2,4-dioxo-1,3-diazaspiro[4,5]decane-8-yl)methyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (12.0 mg) with a yield of 10%.
