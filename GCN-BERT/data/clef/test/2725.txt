CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/987,446, filed on May 1, 2014, the entirety of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD The subject technology relates generally to apparatuses and methods for blood vessel occlusion and vascular stenting. BACKGROUND Veins can become incompetent through the weakening of blood vessel walls or damage to or weakening of valves within the vein. Most frequently, veins carrying oxygen-depleted blood up the legs provide the most apparent visual evidence of the vessel wall or valve weakening, demonstrating that a portion of the veins have become incompetent. When the blood vessel walls weekend or the valves no longer serve their function of reducing or preventing backflow of blood, the vain can become enlarged, weak, and twisted. This condition is referred to as a varicose vein. While the causes of varicose veins are varied and common, varicose veins can be treated using a variety of procedures. SUMMARY Treatment of varicose veins and other blood vessel problems can be achieved through some embodiments disclosed herein. Some embodiments herein relate to vessel occlusion by delivery of radially expandable implant frames that achieve immediate total occlusion of blood flow. Frame configurations, expected delivered and expanded dimensions, and a description of target anatomy of some embodiments is provided. Aspects of implants and delivery devices that can be utilized in combination with the implants, systems, methods, and features disclosed herein are disclosed in: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/826,593, filed on Jun. 29, 2010; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/367,338, filed on Feb. 6, 2012; U.S. Patent Pub.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a full understanding of the subject technology. It should be understood that the subject technology may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the subject technology. While the present description sets forth specific details of various embodiments, it will be appreciated that the description is illustrative only and should not be construed in any way as limiting. It is contemplated that although particular embodiments of the present inventions may be disclosed or shown in particular contexts, such embodiments can be used in a variety of endoluminal applications. Various applications of such embodiments and modifications thereto, which may occur to those who are skilled in the art, are also encompassed by the general concepts described herein. The present disclosure provides various embodiments of an expandable device, such as a stent, and a catheter for supporting and delivering the stent, as well as methods of using the devices and catheters. According to some embodiments, an occlusion system can quickly and reliably close vessels (veins or arteries) such as incompetent venous perforators and arterial venous fistulae. Some embodiments can be performed using minimally invasive techniques that allow a clinician to provide rapid and effective treatment for a variety of vascular conditions. For example, some methods can be provided in which a clinician penetrates percutaneously to a target vessel using a delivery system. The delivery system can comprise a catheter configured to access the target vessel. In some embodiments, the catheter can be a short needle. The percutaneous access can be made at a point closest to the target vessel, such as a perforator-hemorrhage site. Further, in some embodiments, an ultrasound device (such as a handheld ultrasound device) can be used as a visualization tool to facilitate placement of the needle within the target vessel. Further, some methods can be provided in which a clinician percutaneously accesses a target vessel using a catheter. The catheter can be guided to the proper location in the target vessel using image-guided endovascular placement. The catheter can be used to deliver a device that closes or occludes the target vessel. According to some embodiments, devices, catheters, systems, and methods disclosed herein can be used for percutaneous, peripheral occlusion of the arterial and venous vasculature. For example, some embodiments can be used to treat pelvic venous incompetence, varicocele, gonadal vein for pelvic varices in females with chronic pelvic pain, stop blood loss from a damaged blood vessel due to a traumatic arterial injury, stop hemorrhage caused by a neoplasia, and close an abnormal blood vessel or blood vessels supplying a vascular anomaly such as arteriovenous malformations or arteriovenous fistulas, and other conditions. According to some embodiments, devices, catheters, systems, and methods disclosed herein can also be used for percutaneous, peripheral stenting of the arterial and venous vasculature. Some embodiments disclosed herein can be used to treat various insufficiencies in the vasculature. For example, some embodiments can be used to treat venous insufficiencies in a variety of vessels of the venous anatomy, such as between deep veins and perforator veins, including the common femoral, the deep femoral, the external iliac, the femoral, the popliteal, the anterior and/or posterior tibial, and the peroneal veins. The venous system comprises superficial veins, deep veins, and perforator veins that fluidly interconnect the superficial veins with the deep veins. Deep veins are located within the muscle fascia and allow a high volume and pressure of blood to pass therethrough, accounting for approximately 90-95% of venous blood return to the heart. Perforator veins connect the superficial and deep venous networks in the extremities, draining blood to the deep veins as part of the process of returning oxygen-depleted blood to the heart. Perforator veins have one-way valves designed to prevent backflow of blood down towards the superficial veins. When those valves no longer function properly and reflux occurs, the buildup of blood and pressure can cause not only the superficial veins but the perforators themselves to become incompetent. Perforator veins in the lower leg and ankle are particularly vulnerable to distention and incompetence, and the resultant circulatory problems create an increased likelihood of edema, skin discoloration, dermatitis and skin ulcers in the immediate area. Perforator vessels can include: thigh perforators (perforators of the femoral canal and inguinal perforators); knee perforators (medial, lateral, supra-, and infrapatellar and popliteal fossa perforators); leg perforators (medial perforators (paratibial and lower, middle and upper posterior tibial), lateral perforators, anterior perforators, posterior perforators (gastrocnemius, intergemellar, and para-Achillean)); ankle perforators (medial, lateral, and anterior perforators); and foot perforators (medial, lateral, dorsal, and plantar perforators). Superficial veins serve to drain blood from the skin. Blood travels from the superficial veins through the perforator veins to the deep veins. Superficial veins are located near the surface of the skin, outside of the muscle fascia, and they account for approximately 5-10% of venous blood return to the heart. There are two primary superficial veins: the small saphenous vein (SSV) and the great saphenous vein (GSV). In accordance with some embodiments, a medical implant can be provided that can be used in a variety of clinical applications, such as vessel occlusion, stenting, or other functions within a body vessel. The medical implant can comprise a frame and one or more secondary components. The frame can comprise one, two, or more resilient members, such as wires, rings, coils, and other components, which can be drawn out into a delivery configuration in which the frame is in a collapsed configuration and thereafter expands to an expanded state when released from a delivery device, such as a catheter. Referring now to the figures, FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of an implant device 100 that can be delivered to a target location for occluding a blood vessel or body lumen. FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic cross-sectional view of a leg 90 that has a varicose vein 92. The varicose vein 92 can be a superficial vein that is interconnected to a deep vein 94 by a perforator vein 96. As illustrated, some embodiments can be used to treat varicose veins by be implanted into a perforator vein 102 that has a faulty valve. After the implant 100 is implanted into the perforator vein 102, the perforator vein 102 can be occluded, thus preventing any backflow through the perforator vein 102 and reducing or eliminating the varicose vein. FIGS. 1B-1F illustrate schematic views of the vasculature within the legs of a human. As discussed herein, some embodiments of the system and devices can be used to treat varicose veins, such as by treating or closing incompetent venous perforators, or other circulatory afflictions, such as arteriovenous fistulae (AVF), and others. The illustrations in FIGS. 1B-1F provide further detail to illustrate potential target vessels or target areas within the legs of a patient. FIG. 2A-2B illustrate embodiments of the implant device 100, 100′. In referring to these embodiments, reference to FIG. 2B will be understood as referring to each element or feature as a “prime” of the mentioned feature (e.g., a device 100, 100′ or frame member 202, 202′), except as otherwise indicated. The implant device can comprise a frame member 202 and an occlusive member 204. The frame member 202 can be used to anchor the occlusive member 204 within the target vessel or body lumen. In some embodiments, the device 100 can comprise two or more support members that are coupled to at least one link member. Further, the frame member 202 can be self-expandable. In some embodiments, the frame member 202 can also be expandable under the application of force (such as by a balloon), or by electricity or heat (such as by reaching a transition temperature less than the temperature of the human body). The frame member 202 can comprise a proximal support member 210, a distal support member 212, and at least one link member 214 extending between the proximal and distal members 210, 212. The link member 214 can be coupled to the proximal member 210 and the distal member 214 at respective first and second ends 220, 222 of the link member 214. As shown in FIGS. 2A-2B, some embodiments can be configured to comprise a first link member 214 and a second link member 216. The second link member 216 can be coupled to the proximal and distal members 210, 212 at respective first and second ends 224, 226 of the second link member 216. In some embodiments, the frame member can also comprise a variety of structures, including a coil that follows a helical path. Various embodiments that can be used in accordance with the inventions disclosed herein are disclosed in Applicant's co-pending patent applications: U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 14/101,171, filed on Dec. 9, 2013, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference. The occlusive member 204 can be coupled to the frame member 202 can be configured to facilitate at least partial occlusion of the target vessel into which the device 100 is placed. In some embodiments, the occlusive member 204 can comprise an ePTFE membrane or cap that extends around and/or is coupled to the frame member 202. The occlusive member 204 can comprise a proximal end portion 230 and a distal end portion 232. At least one of the proximal end portion 230 and the distal end portion 232 can be coupled to the frame member 202. For example, in some embodiments, the occlusive member 204 can be coupled to the frame member 202 and/or be configured as illustrated in applicant's co-pending patent application Ser. No. 14/101,171, filed Dec. 9, 2013 (084988-0046); Ser. No. 14/044,794, filed on Oct. 2, 2013 (084988-0039); and Ser. No. 13/828,974, filed on Mar. 14, 2013 (084988-0030), the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. The frame member 202 is illustrated in the expanded state 240 in FIG. 2A-2B. According to some embodiments, the frame member 202 can be resiliently deflectable from the expanded state 240 to a collapsed state 242, illustrated in FIG. 3A. Other embodiments illustrated in the figures demonstrate the change from the collapsed state to the expanded state, and similar principles of operation can be implemented in yet additional embodiments. According to some embodiments, the collapsed state of the device can enable the device to be delivered to a target vessel in a low profile size. Subsequently, the device can expand, such as by self-expansion or otherwise, in order to be released and anchored in the target vessel. Some embodiments can be configured such that proximal and/or distal end portions of the implant expand to a diameter much greater than a diameter of a central portion of the implant such that expansion of the implant reduces or eliminates one or more degrees of motion of the device relative to surrounding vasculature. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 1A, proximal and distal end portions 110, 112 of the device 100 have been expanded radially relative to a central portion 114 of the device 100. Thus, when placed in the perforator vein 96, the distal end portion 112 of the device 100 can be released and expanded into the deep vein 94 and the proximal end portion 110 of the device 100 can be released and expanded into the superficial vein 92, thus causing the central portion 114 of the device 100 to reside within the perforator vein 96. This expansion of the device 100 can provide partial or full occlusion of the perforator vein 96. In some embodiments, the device can be configured to be resiliently biased toward an expanded configuration. Thus, the device can be loaded onto a catheter or other delivery mechanism in a delivery or collapsed configuration and, when released, be expanded or spring back to the expanded configuration in the target vessel. Further, in accordance with some embodiments, the one or more link members can be configured to exert an active foreshortening force between the proximal and distal end portions when the device is in the expanded configuration. The one or more link members can be shaped in way that upon release from the delivery mechanism, each link member tends to bring opposing support members together as close as possible by springing back or rebounding into a predetermined V or parabola shape. Thus, in the collapsed configuration, each link member can be elongated or stretched along the longitudinal axis in a state of tension. When the device is released from constraint and allowed to expand towards the expanded configuration, each link member can return to a predetermined shape, causing the length of the device to become foreshortened. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the central portion 114 of the implant 100 can comprise one or more link members that tend to draw the proximal and distal end portions 110, 112 toward each other, thus foreshortening the length of the implant 100. In this manner, the device 100 can be placed at a target vessel (shown as a perforator vessel 96) and longitudinally contract in order to more securely engage the target vessel, provide better occlusion of the target vessel, and reduce obstruction of adjacent vessels (such as the superficial and deep vessels 92, 96). Some embodiments can foreshorten by between about 10% and about 90% of the length of the device 100 in the collapsed state 242. The collapsed length of the device 100 can be measured either using the furthest points of opposing ends or using the points at which the link member(s) interconnects with the proximal and/or distal members. The length of each link member as set and deployed, which can determine the distance between adjacent rings in the expanded configuration (manifesting the vessel closure position) can be between about 3 mm and about 20 mm, between about 4 mm and about 15 mm, between about 6 mm and about 12 mm, between about 8 mm and about 10 mm, or between about 4 mm and about 10 mm. Accordingly, in the collapsed configuration, the length of each link member can be correspondingly increased based on the geometry of the link member in the expanded configuration versus in the collapsed configuration. In some embodiments, in the expanded configuration, a length of the frame member 202 may be between about 7 mm and about 15 mm, between about 8 mm and about 12 mm, or between about 9 mm and about 10 mm. As illustrated in embodiments disclosed herein, the device can comprise two or more link members. The link members can, when seen in side view, have a generally V or parabolic shape. The link members can extend helically about the periphery, outer surface, or circumference of the device. In some embodiments, a path of a link member can reverse direction, such as a helical path reversing pitch, as the link member extends between support members. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 2A-2B, the link members 214, 216 can be configured to extend about the periphery or circumference of the frame member 202. FIG. 2A illustrates that the link members 214, 216 can extend about the periphery or circumference of the frame member 202 in substantially parallel helical directions. FIG. 2A also illustrates that the pitch of the helical direction can be reversed, for example, at about a midpoint of the link member. Further, as illustrated in FIGS. 2B and 5, the link members can be configured to extend about the periphery or circumference of the frame member in substantially opposite helical directions. In accordance with some embodiments, in order to achieve the expanded state 240, the frame member 202 can be configured such that interactions between its component parts and material properties of the component parts tend to create a preferred or default position to which the frame member 202 resiliently expands. Further, in some embodiments, the frame member 202 can be deflectable and deformable from the collapsed configuration to the expanded configuration in order to deliver the device to the target vessel. In some embodiments, a first plane passing through the proximal member 210 and a second plane passing through the distal member 212 can each undergo a rotational or angular movement relative to the longitudinal axis when the frame member 202 moves from the collapsed configuration 242 to the expanded configuration 240. This movement is shown generally in FIGS. 3A-3C. For example, in the collapsed configuration 242, the frame member 202 can be configured such that at least one of the proximal member 210 or the distal member 212 extends substantially parallel or oblique relative to a longitudinal axis of the device 100. When the proximal member 210 and/or the distal member 212 move(s) from the collapsed configuration 242 to the expanded configuration 240, the first and/or second plane(s) can move angularly or rotate relative to the longitudinal axis. For example, as illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4B, a first plane 280 can pass through the proximal member 210, and a second plane 282 can pass through the distal member 212. When the implant 100 is released from the collapsed configuration 242 to the expanded configuration 240, the first and second planes 280, 282 can move or rotate relative to the longitudinal axis 290. For example, in some embodiments, the first and second planes 280, 282 can be substantially perpendicular relative to the longitudinal axis 290. The first and/or second planes can be arbitrary planes that correspond to the respective proximal and distal members. The location or orientation of the planes relative to the members can each be determined based on shape, size, or other characteristics of the members. For example, the planes can each pass through a maximal amount or mass of the respective members. Further, the planes can also be defined by one or more surface features of the members. For example, if the members comprise planar annuli, a top or bottom surface of each annulus can serve to define the extent of the plane. The degree of rotation or angular movement of the first and/or second planes can be between about 10° and about 170°, including any of the angular ranges or angles therebetween, which will not be listed here for brevity. For example, plane(s) passing through the proximal or distal member can be oriented within about 45° or less of the longitudinal axis when in the collapsed configuration 242. For example, as illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4B, a first plane 280, passing through the proximal member 210, and a second plane 282, passing through the distal member 212, can each be oriented within about 45° or less of the longitudinal axis 290. The angle of the planes is shown as element 292 in FIGS. 4A-4B. The degree of rotation or angular movement, as well as the degree of foreshortening, can be measured based on the movement of the proximal and/or distal members outside of the body or when placed in situ. In accordance with some embodiments, the support members (e.g., the proximal and distal members 210, 212) can be configured to pop up post-deployment in order to provide reliable closure of the target vessel or hole. Further, because a target vessel may be fairly short (such as in the case of a venous perforator vessel), the device can be configured to draw opposing ends thereof into a foreshortened configuration. The support members can comprise rings that can be made as solid shapes or as open spirals. Each support member can have a maximum cross-sectional dimension of between about 6 mm and about 20 mm. In some embodiments, the maximum cross-sectional dimension can be between about 8 mm and about 16 mm, between about 10 mm and about 15 mm, between about 12 mm and about 14 mm, between about 8 mm and about 12 mm, or between about 10 mm in 15 mm. In some embodiments, each support member can be configured as a circular or annular shape. Accordingly, a support member can define a diameter in any of the above-noted ranges. Further, the support member can be deflectable and the maximum cross-sectional dimension can represent the maximum cross-sectional dimension of the support member in the expanded configuration. Therefore, the support member can be deflected such that a deflected cross-sectional dimension in the collapsed configuration is greater than the maximum cross-sectional dimension in the expanded configuration. In the expanded configuration, a cross-sectional dimension of the proximal and distal end portions of the device (due to the cross-sectional dimension of the corresponding support member) can be greater than a cross-sectional dimension of a central portion of the device. For example, a cross-sectional dimension of the central portion 114 can be between about 2 mm and about 10 mm. Thus, when in the expanded configuration, the central portion 114 can have a cross-sectional dimension that is less than the cross-sectional dimensions of the proximal and/or distal end portions of the device. Such an embodiment as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 8A-8D. The embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2B, 3C, 5, 6C, and 9C are shown in expanded configurations that are not deployed into or constrained by a corresponding target vessel geometry. When implanted into a corresponding target vessel, the geometry of the target vessel can tend to constrict the cross-sectional dimension of the device in the central portion thereof, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 8A-8D. Delivery of the implant device can be performed using a delivery system that maintains the implant device in a constrained or collapsed configuration while being advanced to the target area. The delivery system can carry the implant device in the collapsed configuration until reaching the target area and thereafter be actuated to release the implant device at the target area. The actuation of the delivery system can be performed in accordance with some of the embodiments disclosed herein. Further, in accordance with some embodiments, the delivery system can comprise a catheter or a needle delivery member. As illustrated in FIGS. 3A-4B, the frame member 202 of the device 100 (referring to the embodiment in FIG. 2A, although any of the embodiments disclosed herein can be used with any of the delivery systems disclosed herein) can be configured to be supported or engaged by a distal end of a catheter 300. The catheter 300 can comprise at least one notch that facilitates engagement between the frame member 202. The frame member 202 comprises proximal and distal members 210, 212 that can be engaged within the respective proximal and distal notches 302, 304. For example, the delivery system can comprise an actuation wire 310 that can extend through a lumen of the catheter 300 in order to engage the respective proximal and distal members 210, 212. The actuation and function of the delivery system can incorporate features disclosed in Applicant's co-pending patent application Ser. No. 14/101,171, filed Dec. 9, 2013 (084988-0046); Ser. No. 14/044,794, filed on Oct. 2, 2013 (084988-0039); and Ser. No. 13/828,974, filed on Mar. 14, 2013 (084988-0030), the entireties of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. According to some embodiments, the device can be engaged, supported, and/or housed along a distal portion of the system. Some embodiments can advantageously provide a needle delivery member that has a small cross-sectional profile. For example, the needle or needle delivery member can comprise a needle profile that defines an outer diameter from about 3Fr, 4Fr, 5Fr, 6Fr, 7Fr, 8Fr, or 9Fr, as noted in Table 1 below and discussed further herein. TABLE 1 French Diameter Diameter Gauge (mm) (inches) 3 1 0.039 4 1.33 0.053 5 1.67 0.066 6 2 0.079 7 2.3 0.092 8 2.7 0.105 9 3 0.118 FIG. 5 illustrates an embodiment of a delivery system 400 for delivering an implant device to a target vessel. The delivery system 400 can comprise a needle component 402 and a catheter 404 that is slidably mounted within a lumen 406 of the needle component 402. The catheter 404 can support an implant device 410 in the manner described above with respect to FIGS. 3A-3B. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the system 400 can comprise a handle portion 420 that is coupled to the needle component 402. The handle portion 420 can comprise an actuating mechanism 422 that can be operative to control proximal or distal movement of the catheter 404. Additionally, the handle portion can comprise an implant release component 424 that can be coupled to a proximal end of the actuation wire 310 (shown in FIGS. 3A-3C). In use, the delivery system 400 can be advanced to a target vessel, such as an incompetent perforator vessel that is to be closed. The needle component 402 can be advanced into the tissue of the patient and delivered as illustrated in FIGS. 6A-6D. As shown in FIGS. 6A-6B, the delivery system 400 can be introduced through the skin 450 with image guidance provided by a hand held ultrasound system 452. For example, in some embodiments, a scope, vessel finder, or vessel transiluminator, such as a Venoscope®, can be used to locate the target veins or arteries. A guidewire can be introduced into a superficial vein 460, which can be used to facilitate introduction of a needle component 402. The needle component 402 can be advanced into the superficial vein 460 toward a perforator vein 462 that interconnects the superficial vein 460 with a deep vein 464. FIG. 6B illustrates that once the needle component has been guided into the perforator vein 462, the catheter 404, with the implant 410 supported thereon, can be advanced until a distal end 470 of the catheter 404 enters or is positioned adjacent to the deep vein 464. The distal end 470 can be advanced until it is positioned within the deep vein 464, adjacent to an inner wall 466 of the deep vein 464, or at least is placed deep inside of the perforator vein 462, which can be aided by ultrasound visualization. Once the distal end 470 of the catheter 404 is in the proper position within the deep vein 464, the implant distal portion 412 can be released from engagement with the catheter 404. In order to release the implant device 410, the distal end portion 412 can be released as shown in FIG. 6C. Thereafter, a proximal end portion 414 of the implant device 410 can be released and permitted to expand into the superficial vein 460. The needle component 402 thereafter can be proximally withdrawn out of the perforator vein 462, as illustrated in FIGS. 6C-6D. As the implant device 410 moves towards its expanded configuration, the proximal and distal end portions 412, 414 can be drawn together by virtue of the foreshortening created by the link member(s) of the implant device 410. Thus, closure of the perforator vein 462 can occur immediately or instantaneously after release of the proximal end portion 414 of the device 410. In case of occlusion of AVF, the delivery system can be configured similarly to that described above with respect to FIGS. 5-6D. The delivery system can optionally deliver the implant device using a catheter and image guided endovascular intervention. For example, the delivery system in the case of AVF can achieve access through traditional pathways, such as the femoral or jugular artery, or other appropriate pathways, and be advanced toward the target area. In such embodiments, the profile of the catheter can be about 3Fr, 4Fr, 5Fr, 6Fr, or 7Fr. Referring now to FIGS. 7-8C, another occlusive device 500 is shown in expanded and collapsed configurations, and in relationship to a catheter 300 on which the device 500 can be supported. The device 500 comprises proximal and distal members 510, 512 and a pair of link members 520, 522. The link members 520, 522 can be coupled to the proximal and distal members 510, 512 and extend in a helical direction about the periphery or circumference of the device 500. As shown, the link members 520, 522 can extend in opposing helical directions. However, as illustrated in the embodiment shown in FIG. 2A, some embodiments can be configured such that the link members extend in the same helical direction. Additional details and features related to the operation and interaction of the device 500 with the catheter during expansion or release of the device 500 similar to those described above with respect to FIGS. 3A-3C and will not be repeated here and for brevity. FIGS. 9A-9B illustrate perspective views of another embodiment of an occlusive device 600, in an expanded configuration 602 and in a collapsed configuration 604. The device 600 can comprise a proximal member 610 and a distal member 612, as well as an occlusive member 614. The proximal and distal members can be interconnected by at least one link member 620. The device 600 can incorporate many of the features and advantages discussed above with respect to the devices shown in FIGS. 1-8C, in such features will not be discussed here and for brevity. The link member 620 can be configured to rebound or assume a U- or V-shaped configuration when in the expanded configuration 602. The device can be coupled to a catheter 650 and released there from when delivered to the target vessel, as illustrated in FIGS. 10A-10C. In accordance with some embodiments, in order to facilitate engagement with the catheter 650, the device 600 can comprise proximal and distal apertures 660, 662 configured to be engaged with an actuation wire 652 at respective first and second slots 670, 672 of the catheter 650. The implant device 600 can be coupled to the catheter as illustrated in FIG. 10A. In order to release the device 600, the actuation wire 652 can be proximally withdrawn within the catheter 650 until the distal and proximal members 612, 610 are sequentially released from engagement with the catheter 650. This embodiment can provide the advantageous functions illustrated in discussed above with respect to the other devices and delivery systems. In accordance with yet another embodiment, FIGS. 11A-11C illustrate sequential steps in releasing an occlusive device 700 from engagement with a catheter 710. The device 700 is configured as discussed above with respect to the device 100′ shown in FIG. 2B. Accordingly, the discussion herein for the device 100′ is incorporated here and will not be repeated for brevity. FIGS. 11A-11C illustrate another delivery method or system that can be employed in delivering an implant device to a target region. As shown in FIG. 11A, the device 700 can be loaded onto the catheter 710 without having the device 700 and the catheter 710 or otherwise require the catheter 710 to be inserted into an inner volume of the device 700. As such, the device 700 can be carried on only a portion of the outer surface of the catheter 710. In the illustrated embodiment, the catheter 710 is shown as a hollow, tubular catheter; however, the catheter 710 can be replaced by a flat delivery substrate or solid core member whose size can be further decreased in order to access small vessels while providing a sufficiently rigid structure against which the device can be supported in a collapsed configuration. Sufficient rigidity is necessary in order to prevent the catheter or support device from bending in response to the bias force exerted by the link member(s) of the device. According to various embodiments of the subject technology, the support frame may comprise at least one of stainless steel, nickel titanium (NiTi), cobalt chromium (CoCr), titanium, a polymer, a polyester based material, a tyrosine based polycarbonate, a polyethylene based material, Teflon (e.g., including expanded Teflon), and other suitable materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the support frame may comprise at least one of polyethylene, polyglicolide, polylactide, ε-caprolactone, polycarbonate, hydroxyalkanote, para dioxinine, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), PLA, PGA, PLLA, PDLLA, PDO, PCL, and other suitable materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the support frame and/or occlusion membrane may comprise a bioabsorbable material, beneficially allowing for their controlled degradation. In some embodiments, the support frame and/or occlusion membrane may be formed of bioabsorbable material to have a controlled degradation anywhere between about 3 months to about 3 years depending on the desired application of support frame. In some embodiments, the controlled degradation may be less than about 3 months or greater than about 3 years. For example, hydrolysis of ester linkages or effects of enzymatic degradation may be utilized for the controlled degradation. According to various embodiments of the subject technology, occlusion membrane may be used to occlude, partially or completely, luminal structure in which an implant is deployed. In some embodiments as used herein, occlusion may refer to either partial or complete occlusion. Some embodiments can be deployed in vessels having dimensions of between about 3 mm to about 20 mm. This exceptional and advantageous ability of embodiments of the medical implants disclosed herein to provide stenting in such small vessels is made possible, for example, due to the minimal delivery profile can be achieved using such embodiments. The target delivery profile can be about 8Fr or smaller. Further, some embodiments can optionally comprise a fibrous membrane component, in various clinical applications, as discussed above. According to some embodiments, implants disclosed herein having a fibrous membrane feature can have an expanded diameter of between about 3 mm to about 22 mm. According to various aspects of the subject technology, implants disclosed herein may be used for various applications for reducing or stopping flow through a luminal structure in a patient. Implants of the subject technology may be used for rapid, well-controlled, and reliable occlusion of luminal structures. For example, the luminal structure may comprise at least one of a blood vessel, a body organ, a lung, an airway, a Fallopian tube, a cervical canal, a vagina, a cervix, a vas deferens, a bronchus, a ureter, a colon, a rectum, an anus, a bio duct, a pancreatic duct, or other suitable tubular structures known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Some embodiments can be used to close a ductus arteriosis from a patent ductus arteriosis. In some embodiments, implants of the present disclosure may be used for temporary occlusion in cases of lung disease, or for temporary occlusion of female reproductive organs for contraceptive purposes. In some embodiments, implants of the present disclosure may be removed, or flow may be restored through the luminal structure to restore original organ functions. In some embodiments, implants of the present disclosure may be used for various endoluminal occlusion procedures, including procedures for the lungs (e.g., selective endobronchial occlusion for lung reduction, occlusion of bronchopleural or bronchocutaneous fistulas, endovascular occlusion of pulmonary AVMs and fistulas or aortopulmonary anastomoses) and procedures for reproductive organs (e.g., endoluminal occlusion of vas deferens or Fallopian tubes for minimally-invasive contraceptive intervention, endovascular occlusion of varicocele in males and low abdominal gonadal veins for reducing or completely eliminating chronic pelvic pain syndrome in females). In some embodiments, implants of the present disclosure may be used for reducing or stopping blood loss from a damaged blood vessel, closing an abnormal blood vessel or a blood vessel supplying a vascular anomaly, or interrupting blood supply to an organ or part of an organ for permanent devascularization (e.g., closure of splenic artery in spleen laceration, devascularization of tissues involved by neoplastic process, either pre-operatively or as a palliative measure). In some embodiments, implants of the present disclosure may be used for various endovascular (e.g., neural and peripheral) procedures including procedures for giant cerebral and skull base aneurysms (ruptured and non-ruptured), head and neck arteriovenous fistulas, dissecting intracranial and extracranial vessels, traumatic and non-traumatic vessel injury or rupture (e.g., pelvic hemorrhages in trauma patients, carotid blow-out in patients with head and neck cancers, hemorrhage induced by a neoplasia, etc.), and devascularization prior to (or as an alternative to) surgical resection of various organs or tumors. In certain embodiments, implants of the present disclosure may be used for various organs, including for example, the spleen (e.g., endovascular occlusion as a preoperative intervention or as an alternative to surgical resection with indications including traumatic hemorrhage, hypersplenism, bleeding secondary to portal hypertension or splenic vein thrombosis, and various disorders such as thalassemia major, thrombocytopenia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Gaucher disease, and Hodgkin disease), the liver (e.g., occlusion of portal veins collaterals as adjunct to a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), occlusion of the TIPS itself in cases of encephalopathy, occlusion of intrahepatic arterioportal fistulas), the kidney (e.g., endoluminal ureteral occlusion for intractable lower urinary tract fistula with urine leakage, or for the treatment of uretero-arterial fistulae, endovascular occlusion as an alternative to surgical resection for end-stage renal disease or renovascular hypertension requiring unilateral or bilateral nephrectomy and renal transplant with native kidneys in situ), and the heart (e.g., occlusion of coronary arteriovenous fistulas, transarterial embolization of Blalock-Taussig shunts). The application of implants of the present disclosure is not limited to applications for human patients, but may also include veterinary applications. According to some embodiments, covers (including patches) disclosed herein and in the above-noted patent applications, including but not limited to the cover 132, can be attached to a respective implant. Covers disclosed herein may be attached to one or both ends or an implant and/or a middle region of an implant. According to various embodiments of the subject technology, covers may be used to occlude, partially or completely, luminal structure in which a respective implant is deployed. In some embodiments as used herein, occlusion may refer to either partial or complete occlusion. In some embodiments, covers include at least one of a polyurethane, a polyanhidrate, PTFE, ePTFE, silicone, and other suitable materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, covers may be elastic. In some embodiments, covers may be permeable or non-permeable. In some embodiments, an average thickness of a cover is between about 0.0005 inches and about 0.006 inches. In some aspects, the average thickness of a cover may be less than about 0.0005 inches or greater than about 0.006 inches. In certain embodiments, an average thickness of a distal portion of a cover is greater than an average thickness of a proximal portion of a cover. Such a configuration may ensure that more flow may be reduced at the distal portion of a cover. In some embodiments, the average thickness of the distal portion of a cover is between about 0.002 inches and about 0.012 inches. In some embodiments, the average thickness of the distal portion of a cover may be less than about 0.002 inches or greater than about 0.012 inches. In some embodiments, the average thickness of the proximal portion of a cover is between about 0.0005 inches and about 0.006 inches. In some embodiments, the average thickness of the proximal portion of a cover may be less than about 0.0005 inches or greater than about 0.006 inches. The foregoing description is provided to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the various configurations described herein. While the subject technology has been particularly described with reference to the various figures and configurations, it should be understood that these are for illustration purposes only and should not be taken as limiting the scope of the subject technology. There may be many other ways to implement the subject technology. Various functions and elements described herein may be partitioned differently from those shown without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Various modifications to these configurations will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and generic principles defined herein may be applied to other configurations. Thus, many changes and modifications may be made to the subject technology, by one having ordinary skill in the art, without departing from the scope of the subject technology. It is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes disclosed is an illustration of exemplary approaches. Based upon design preferences, it is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes may be rearranged. Some of the steps may be performed simultaneously. The accompanying method claims present elements of the various steps in a sample order, and are not meant to be limited to the specific order or hierarchy presented. As used herein, the phrase “at least one of” preceding a series of items, with the term “and” or “or” to separate any of the items, modifies the list as a whole, rather than each member of the list (i.e., each item). The phrase “at least one of” does not require selection of at least one of each item listed; rather, the phrase allows a meaning that includes at least one of any one of the items, and/or at least one of any combination of the items, and/or at least one of each of the items. By way of example, the phrases “at least one of A, B, and C” or “at least one of A, B, or C” each refer to only A, only B, or only C; any combination of A, B, and C; and/or at least one of each of A, B, and C. Terms such as “top,” “bottom,” “front,” “rear” and the like as used in this disclosure should be understood as referring to an arbitrary frame of reference, rather than to the ordinary gravitational frame of reference. Thus, a top surface, a bottom surface, a front surface, and a rear surface may extend upwardly, downwardly, diagonally, or horizontally in a gravitational frame of reference. Furthermore, to the extent that the term “include,” “have,” or the like is used in the description or the claims, such term is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term “comprise” as “comprise” is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim. The word “exemplary” is used herein to mean “serving as an example, instance, or illustration.” Any embodiment described herein as “exemplary” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. A reference to an element in the singular is not intended to mean “one and only one” unless specifically stated, but rather “one or more.” Pronouns in the masculine (e.g., his) include the feminine and neuter gender (e.g., her and its) and vice versa. The term “some” refers to one or more. Underlined and/or italicized headings and subheadings are used for convenience only, do not limit the subject technology, and are not referred to in connection with the interpretation of the description of the subject technology. All structural and functional equivalents to the elements of the various configurations described throughout this disclosure that are known or later come to be known to those of ordinary skill in the art are expressly incorporated herein by reference and intended to be encompassed by the subject technology. Moreover, nothing disclosed herein is intended to be dedicated to the public regardless of whether such disclosure is explicitly recited in the above description. While certain aspects and embodiments of the inventions have been described, these have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions. Indeed, the novel methods and systems described herein may be embodied in a variety of other forms without departing from the spirit thereof. The accompanying claims and their equivalents are intended to cover such forms or modifications as would fall within the scope and spirit of the inventions. 1.
