FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a bacterial cell which has improved phage resistance, starter cultures comprising the cell, and dairy products fermented with the starter culture. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION The food industry uses numerous bacteria, in particular lactic bacteria, in order to improve the taste and the texture of foods but also in order to extend the shelf life of these foods. In the case of the dairy industry, lactic bacteria are used intensively in order to bring about the acidification of milk (by fermentation) but also in order to texturize the product into which they are incorporated. Among the lactic bacteria used in the food industry, there can be mentioned the genera Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Bifidobacterium. The lactic bacteria of the species Streptococcus thermophilus are used extensively alone or in combination with other bacteria for the production of food products, in particular fermented products. They are used in particular in the formulation of the ferments used for the production of fermented milks, for example yogurts. Certain of them play a dominant role in the development of the texture of the fermented product. This characteristic is closely linked to the production of polysaccharides. Among the strains of Streptococcus thermophilus it is possible to distinguish texturizing and non-texturizing strains. WO2007095958A1 discloses Streptococcus thermophilus strains with texturizing properties. In FIG. 1 it can be seen that the most texturizing strain CHCC8833 (DSM17876) has a shear stress value of around 59 Pa. In order to meet the requirements of the industry, it has become necessary to provide novel texturizing strains of lactic bacteria, in particular of Streptococcus thermophilus, for texturizing food products. Especially there is a need for a novel texturizing strain of Streptococcus thermophilus which can be used together with a strain of a Lactobacillus species. Another need of the industry is that the strain is resistant to bacteriophages normally found in the food industry. SUMMARY OF INVENTION The present inventors have provided a novel group of lactic acid bacteria of the species Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which surprisingly is more resistant to phage attack than the (mother) strain from which it is obtained. Further, it has surprisingly turned out that this group of bacteria generates higher shear stress and/or gel stiffness than the mother strain when the bacteria are used for fermenting milk. It is surprising that a phage resistant mutant strain generates more texture, e.g. higher shear stress and/or gel stiffness, (when the strain is used to ferment milk) than the mother strain, and it is especially surprising that a phage resistant mutant strain of a strain which (also) contains a mutation in the galK gene (relative to the wildtype strain) generates more texture (when the strain is used to ferment milk) than the mother strain. In accordance with the above surprising findings, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a texturizing lactic acid bacterium strain by screening for phage resistant mutants of a mother strain, e.g. a method for manufacturing a texturizing lactic acid bacterium (e.g. a bacterium which, besides being e.g. phage resistant, substantial phage resistant, and/or possesses increased phage resistance compared to the mother stain, is more texturizing than the mother strain), comprising the steps: a) Providing a lactic acid bacterial strain (the mother strain); and b) Isolating a mutant strain of the mother strain, which mutant strain is resistant against more phages (e.g. more types of phages or more strains of phages) than the mother strain. Further, the present invention relates to texturizing lactic acid bacteria strains, such as S. thermophilus strains or Lactobacillus bulgaricus stains, which are modified to be resistant to more phages than the mother strain, in particular against one of the phages CHPC658, CHPC1057, CHPC1089 and CHPC1152. DETAILED DISCLOSURE In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a lactic acid bacterium (which is e.g. phage resistant, substantial phage resistant, and/or possesses increased phage resistance compared to the mother stain, or which generates higher shear stress and/or gel stiffness than the mother strain when the bacteria are used for fermenting milk), comprising the steps: a) Providing a lactic acid bacterial strain (the mother strain); andb) Isolating a mutant strain of the mother strain, which mutant strain is resistant against more phages (e.g. more types of phages or more strains of phages) than the mother strain, and/or which mutant is resistant against a phage which the mother strain is not resistant to (under that same conditions). In an interesting aspect, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a lactic acid bacterium (which is e.g. phage resistant, substantial phage resistant, and/or possesses increased phage resistance compared to the mother stain and/or which generates higher shear stress and/or gel stiffness than the mother strain when the bacteria are used for fermenting milk), comprising the steps: a) Providing a lactic acid bacterial strain (the mother strain); anda1) Exposing the lactic bacterial strain to a bacteriophage, e.g. a bacteriophage which is able to lyse the mother strain, such as a phage selected from the group consisting of CHPC658, CHPC1057, CHPC1089 and CHPC1152, and;b) Isolating a mutant strain of the mother strain, which mutant strain is resistant against the phage (or which strain is not lysed by the phage). Also, the present invention relates to a method, comprising the steps: a) Providing a lactic acid bacterial strain (the mother strain);a1) Exposing the lactic bacterial strain to a bacteriophage, e.g. a bacteriophage which is able to lyse the mother strain, such as a phage selected from the group consisting of CHPC658, CHPC1057, CHPC1089 and CHPC1152;a2) Incubating the exposed bacterial cells in a growth medium; andb) isolating a mutant strain of the mother strain, which mutant strain is not lysed by the bacteriophage The methods of the invention may comprise the step c) mutating (e.g. by chemical treatment or radiation treatment, or by means of genetic engineering techniques) the mother strain, e.g. before, during or after step a1). Also, any method of the invention may comprise the step d) introducing a mutation in the galK gene or the galK regulatory sequence (e.g. promoter) of the strain (e.g. by chemical treatment or radiation treatment, or by means of genetic engineering techniques), e.g. before, during or after step c), or before, during or after step a1).

Also, the method of the invention may lead to a mutation resulting in increased galactose fermenting activity compared to the mother strain. The mutation may result in the replacement of one or more nucleotides in the region between the Pribnow box and the ribosome binding site of the galK gene, such as replacement of C in the sequence TTCAGT downstream from the wildtype Pribnow box with a nucleotide selected from the group consisting of A, T and G. In an other embodiment, the mutation may result in: the replacement of one or more nucleotides in the region between the Pribnow box and the ribosome binding site of the galK gene, such as replacement of C in the sequence TTCAGT (SEQ ID NO:6) downstream from the wildtype Pribnow box with a nucleotide selected from the group consisting of A, T and G; and/orthe replacement of one or both of C and G in the wildtype −10 region (TACGAT, SEQ ID NO:7) with a nucleotide independently selected from the group consisting of A and T; and/orthe replacement of C the wildtype −10 region (TACGAT, SEQ ID NO:7) with a nucleotide independently selected from the group consisting of A and T; and/orthe replacement of C the wildtype −10 region (TACGAT, SEQ ID NO:7) with T; and/ora −10 region which has the nucleotide sequence TATGAT (SEQ ID NO:8), TATTAT (SEQ ID NO:9) or TACTAT (SEQ ID NO:10).

The dairy product of the invention may optionally comprise an ingredient selected from the group consisting of: a fruit concentrate, a syrup, a probiotic bacterial culture, a coloring agent, a thickening agent, a flavoring agent, and a preserving agent.

In a presently preferred embodiment, the viscosity of more than 100 Pa is obtained by growth of the bacterial cells alone, but higher viscosity values can be obtained by addition of chemical compounds, such as starch, gelatine, a carrageenan, etc. In an other embodiment, the dairy product of the invention has a viscosity/texture in the range of 100 to 200 Pa, such as in the range of 100 to 150 Pa, or in the range of 105 to 125 Pa, measured as shear stress. In a further embodiment, the dairy product of the invention is a drinkable product, e.g. drinking yoghurt. The invention also relates to novel bacteriophages usable in a method of the invention, such as a bacteriophage selected from the group consisting of CHPC658 (DSM 23961), CHPC1057, CHPC1089 and CHPC1152 (DSM 23994), and mutant and variants thereof, such as mutants and variants which are able to lyse strains mentioned herein, e.g. the strain CHCC6008. Further, the invention relates to novel bacterial strains, useable as mother strains in a method of the invention, such as strains selected from the group consisting of CHCC11342 (DSM22932), CHCC10019 (DSM19252), CHCC11379 (DSM 22884), CHCC11976 (DSM 22934), and mutants thereof. As used herein, the term “lactic acid bacterium” designates a gram-positive, microaerophilic or anaerobic bacterium, which ferments sugars with the production of acids including lactic acid as the predominantly produced acid, acetic acid and propionic acid. The industrially most useful lactic acid bacteria are found within the order “Lactobacillales” which includes Lactococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pseudoleuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp., Brevibacterium spp., Enterococcus spp. and Propionibacterium spp. Additionally, lactic acid producing bacteria belonging to the group of the strict anaerobic bacteria, bifidobacteria, i.e. Bifidobacterium spp., are generally included in the group of lactic acid bacteria. These are frequently used as food cultures alone or in combination with other lactic acid bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria, including bacteria of the species Lactobacillus sp. and Streptococcus thermophilus, are normally supplied to the dairy industry either as frozen or freeze-dried cultures for bulk starter propagation or as so-called “Direct Vat Set” (DVS) cultures, intended for direct inoculation into a fermentation vessel or vat for the production of a dairy product, such as a fermented milk product. Such cultures are in general referred to as “starter cultures” or “starters”. The term “milk” is to be understood as the lacteal secretion obtained by milking any mammal, such as cows, sheep, goats, buffaloes or camels. In a preferred embodiment, the milk is cow's milk. The term milk also includes protein/fat solutions made of plant materials, e.g. soy milk. The term “milk substrate” may be any raw and/or processed milk material that can be subjected to fermentation according to the method of the invention. Thus, useful milk substrates include, but are not limited to, solutions/suspensions of any milk or milk like products comprising protein, such as whole or low fat milk, skim milk, buttermilk, reconstituted milk powder, condensed milk, dried milk, whey, whey permeate, lactose, mother liquid from crystallization of lactose, whey protein concentrate, or cream. Obviously, the milk substrate may originate from any mammal, e.g. being substantially pure mammalian milk, or reconstituted milk powder. Preferably, at least part of the protein in the milk substrate is proteins naturally occurring in milk, such as casein or whey protein. However, part of the protein may be proteins which are not naturally occurring in milk. The term “milk” is to be understood as the lacteal secretion obtained by milking any mammal, such as cows, sheep, goats, buffaloes or camels. In a preferred embodiment, the milk is cow's milk. Prior to fermentation, the milk substrate may be homogenized and pasteurized according to methods known in the art. “Homogenizing” as used herein means intensive mixing to obtain a soluble suspension or emulsion. If homogenization is performed prior to fermentation, it may be performed so as to break up the milk fat into smaller sizes so that it no longer separates from the milk. This may be accomplished by forcing the milk at high pressure through small orifices. “Pasteurizing” as used herein means treatment of the milk substrate to reduce or eliminate the presence of live organisms, such as microorganisms. Preferably, pasteurization is attained by maintaining a specified temperature for a specified period of time. The specified temperature is usually attained by heating. The temperature and duration may be selected in order to kill or inactivate certain bacteria, such as harmful bacteria. A rapid cooling step may follow. “Fermentation” in the methods of the present invention means the conversion of carbohydrates into alcohols or acids through the action of a microorganism. Preferably, fermentation in the methods of the invention comprises conversion of lactose to lactic acid. Fermentation processes to be used in production of fermented milk products are well known and the person of skill in the art will know how to select suitable process conditions, such as temperature, oxygen, amount and characteristics of microorganism(s) and process time. Obviously, fermentation conditions are selected so as to support the achievement of the present invention, i.e. to obtain a dairy product in solid or liquid form (fermented milk product). The term “stirred type product” specifically refers to a fermented milk product which sustains a mechanical treatment after fermentation, resulting in a destructuration and liquefaction of the coagulum formed under the fermentation stage. The mechanical treatment is typically but not exclusively obtained by stirring, pumping, filtrating or homogenizing the gel, or by mixing it with other ingredients. Stirred type products typically but not exclusively have a milk solid non-fat content of 9 to 15%. The term “set-type product” includes a product based on milk which has been inoculated with a starter culture, e.g. a starter culture, and packaged next to the inoculating step and then fermented in the package. The term “drinkable product” includes beverages such as “drinking yoghurt” and similar. The term “drinking yoghurt” typically covers a milk product produced by fermentation by the combination of Lactobacillus species and Streptococcus thermophiles. Drinking yoghurt typically has a milk solid non-fat content of 8% or more. Furthermore, the live culture count for drinking yoghurt drinks is typically at least 10E6 cell forming units (CFU) pr ml. “Drinkable product” according to the present invention include any drinkable product based on acidified milk substrates, thus including fermented milk drinks and liquid yoghurt drinks. In the methods of the present invention, acidification is performed as a fermentation with a microorganism, optionally an acid is added, such as an organic acid (e.g. lactic acid, lactobionic acid or GDL). Drinkable products according to the invention are drinkable in the sense that they are in liquid form and consumed as beverages, i.e. they are suitable for drinking instead of being eaten with a spoon. “In liquid form” means that the products are in the fluid state of matter thus exhibiting a characteristic readiness to flow. Thus, the shape of a liquid is usually determined by the container it fills, in contrary to e.g. a gel-like substance, which is soft, but not free flowing, such as e.g. yoghurt or pudding. Drinkable products according to the invention may have a viscosity allowing the consumer to drink the products using a straw if desired. An drinkable product according to the present invention may have a pH of less than 4.6, preferably less than 4.4, more preferably less than 4.2 and even more preferably about pH 4 or less. In one aspect, the drinkable product has a pH of less than 3.8, such as less than 3.6. An drinkable product according to the invention may have a fat content of 0 to 2%, preferably below 1.5%, below 1% or below 0.5%, more preferably of about 0.1% or less. The drinkable product may have a milk solid non-fat content of less than 20%, preferably less than 8.5%, less than 8%, less than 7.5%, less than 7%, less than 6.5% or less than 6%, and more preferably of about 5%. An drinkable product according to the invention may have a protein content of between 0.5 and 4%. In one preferred aspect, the drinkable product has a protein content of below 1%. In another preferred aspect, the drinkable product has a protein content of between 2% and 3%. An drinkable product according to the invention may have a shelf life of more than 7 days, preferably more than 14 days, more preferably more than 28 days, such as more than 3 months. An drinkable product according to the present invention may have an improved sedimentation stability. The stability may be determined after having stored the drinkable product for an appropriate number of days by measuring the height of the whey collecting on the surface because of syneresis. It may also be determined after accelerated syneresis, such as by centrifugation. For a drinkable product, e.g. drinking yoghurt, a high shear treatment (e.g. homogenization) after fermentation is normally needed to break down the protein network in order to obtain smooth, homogeneous and drinkable products. The breakdown of the network implies that drinking yoghurts have a reduced sedimentation stability, resulting in sedimentation of protein to the bottom during shelf life. High fat revels and high protein content increase sedimentation stability, while low fat products (0-0.5% fat) with low protein levels (1-2.5%) normally needs addition of a stabilizer to avoid protein sedimentation. As used herein, the term “bacteriophage” has its conventional meaning as understood in the art ie. a virus that selectively infects one or more bacteria. Many bacteriophages are specific to a particular genus or species or strain of bacteria. The term “bacteriophage” is synonymous with the term “phage”. Bacteriophages may include, but are not limited to, bacteriophages that belong to any of the following virus families: Corticoviridae, Cystoviridae, Inoviridae, Leviviridae, Microviridae, Myoviridae, Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, or Tectiviridae. The bacteriophage may be a lytic bacteriophage or a lysogenic bacteriophage. A lytic bacteriophage is one that follows the lytic pathway through completion of the lytic cycle, rather than entering the lysogenic pathway. A lytic bacteriophage undergoes viral replication leading to lysis of the cell membrane, destruction of the cell, and release of progeny bacteriophage particles capable of infecting other cells. A lysogenic bacteriophage is one capable of entering the lysogenic pathway, in which the bacteriophage becomes a dormant, passive part of the cell's genome through prior to completion of its lytic cycle. In one embodiment, the lactic acid bacterium according to the present invention is resistant to one or more bacteriophage or one or more sets of bacteriophages, in another embodiment, the lactic acid bacterium according to the present invention is resistant to the same bacteriophage that a strain deposited according to the present invention is resistant to. In the present context, the term “phage robust” is used interchangeable with the term “phage resistant”. In the present context, the term “mutant” should be understood as a strain derived, or a strain which can be derived, from a strain of the invention (or the mother strain) by means of e.g. genetic engineering, radiation and/or chemical treatment. It is preferred that the mutant is a functionally equivalent mutant, e.g. a mutant that has substantially the same, or improved, properties (e.g. regarding texture, shear stress, viscosity, gel stiffness, mouth coating, flavor, post acidification, acidification speed, and/or phage robustness) as the mother strain. Such a mutant is a part of the present invention. Especially, the term “mutant” refers to a strain obtained by subjecting a strain of the invention to any conventionally used mutagenization treatment including treatment with a chemical mutagen such as ethane methane sulphonate (EMS) or N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitroguanidine (NTG), UV light, or to a spontaneously occurring mutant. A mutant may have been subjected to several mutagenization treatments (a single treatment should be understood one mutagenization step followed by a screening/selection step), but it is presently preferred that no more than 20, or no more than 10, or no more than 5, treatments (or screening/selection steps) are carried out. In a presently preferred mutant, less that 5%, or less than 1% or even less than 0.1% of the nucleotides in the bacterial genome have been shifted with another nucleotide, or deleted, compared to the mother strain. In the present context, the term “variant” should be understood as a strain which is functionally equivalent to a strain of the invention, e.g. having substantially the same, or improved, properties e.g. regarding texture, shear stress, viscosity, gel stiffness, mouth coating, flavor, post acidification, acidification speed, and/or phage robustness). Such variants, which may be identified using appropriate screening techniques, are a part of the present invention. In the present context, “texture” is measured as shear stress after 12 hours growth at 37 degrees C. The SI unit for shear stress and gel stiffness is pascal (Pa). An assay to be used for analysis of texture: The day after incubation, the fermented milk was brought to 13° C. and stirred gently by means of a stick fitted with a bored disc until homogeneity of the sample. The rheological properties of the sample were assessed on a rheometer (StressTech, Reologica Instruments, Sweden) equipped with a C25 coaxial measuring system. The viscometry test was made with shear rates varying from 0.27 to 300 1/s in 21 steps. Shear rates were increased and then decreased and the upward and downward curves of shear stress and apparent viscosity were recorded. Delay and integration times were 5 s and 10 s, respectively.

EXPERIMENTAL Example 1 Development of Phage Resistant Streptococcus thermophilus Strains with Improved Texture Properties Development of CHCC11977 The mother strain CHCC11342 was obtained as described in example 5. The strain is a mutant of CHCC6008 and considered to be a galactose fermenting S. thermophilus strain. The strain CHCC11977 was isolated on M17 agar plate after plating 0.1 ml of an M17 over night culture of CHCC11342 together with 0.1 ml of phage CHPC1152 containing 10E09 (10exp9) phage particles per ml and incubation for two days at 37° C. One mutant, called CHCC11977, was three times colony purified and retested in plaque test on M17 agar plates at 37° C. using phage CHPC1152 where phage resistance was confirmed (no single plaques observed). The mutant strain was then also tested in M17 broth at 37° C. in the presence of phage CHPC1152. CHCC11977 remained its phage resistance also in liquid culture, whereas CHCC11342, as expected, was attacked by CHPC1152. CHCC11977 was also tested in milk at different temperatures (without the addition of infecting phage) showing an acidification activity comparable to the mother strain CHCC11342. Analysis of CHCC11342 Texture in Fermented Milk The day after incubation, the fermented milk was brought to 13° C. and stirred gently by means of a stick fitted with a bored disc until homogeneity of the sample. The rheological properties of the sample were assessed on a rheometer (StressTech, Reologica Instruments, Sweden) equipped with a C25 coaxial measuring system. The viscometry test was made with shear rates varying from 0.27 to 300 1/s in 21 steps. Shear rates were increased and then decreased and the upward and downward curves of shear stress and apparent viscosity were recorded. Delay and integration times were 5 s and 10 s, respectively. For further analysis, shear stress at 300 s−1 was chosen. The rheometer results showed that CHCC11342 had a shear stress value of 73.0 Pa compared to CHCC6008 with a shear stress value of 68.0 Pa, see FIG. 1. Analysis of CHCC11977 Texture in Fermented Milk Fermented milk was obtained, and the texture related properties were analyzed, as described above for the gal-positive phage resistant mutant. The rheometer results showed that CHCC11977 had a shear stress value which was furthermore improved by 10% compared to CHCC11342 (shear stress value 80.0 Pa for CHCC11977 compared with 73.0 Pa for mother strain CHCC11342, see FIG. 1). Furthermore, the gel stiffness (G*) was increased by 20% for the phage resistant mutant CHCC11977 which showed a value of 126.0 Pa compared to CHCC11342 (gel stiffness 104.0 Pa). With this it was possible to improve the important rheology parameters shear stress and gel stiffness significantly by isolating a phage resistant mutant from a galactose positive mother strain. Sequencing of the galK Promoter Region from CHCC11342 To reveal the type of mutation for the galactose positive mutant CHCC11342 the beginning of the galK gene (coding for the galactokinase from S. thermophilus) was sequenced. For CHCC11342 a mutation in the region of the galK promoter was identified (see sequences below). The mutation occurred three nucleotides downstream of the −10-promoter box of the galK gene leading to a C to A nucleotide shift. Promoter region of the galK gene from CHCC11342. The point mutation within the CHCC11342 galk promoter region is indicated with grey color code. The published galK sequence from S. thermophilus ST111 (Genbank accession no. AY704368) is indicated for comparison. −35: −35-promoter box; −10: −10-promoter box; RBS: ribosome binding site. Further Phage Resistant Mutants To reveal a possible relationship between phage resistance and galactose positive phenotype five additional phage resistant mutants were isolated on M17 galactose agar plates from strain CHCC6008 (gal−) which is the mother strain of CHCC11342 (gal+). All five phage resistant mutants, CHCC11396, CHCC11397, CHCC11398, CHCC11399, and CHCC11340 (resistant to phage CHPC1152) were unable to ferment galactose meaning the gal+ phenotype is not directly related with phage resistance. On the other hand it was demonstrated by plaque assay that CHCC11342 (gal+) was still sensitive to phage CHPC1152. Example 2 Development of Phage Resistant Lactobacillus delbrueckii Subsp. Bulgaricus Strains with Improved Texture Properties From the mother strain CHCC10019 (DSM19252), phage resistant mutants were isolated as follows: Mutants were picked from MRS agar plates containing 10 mM CaCl2/10 mM MgCl2 after plating 0.1 ml of an MRS over night culture of CHCC10019 together with 0.1 ml of a CHPC658 phage lysate containing 10E06 phage particles per ml and anaerobic incubation for two days at 37° C. Thirty mutants were isolated and tested in cross-streaking towards phage CHPC658. Twenty-nine mutants appeared resistant in the cross-streaking test, and were afterwards three times colony-purified on MRS agar plates at 37° C. The 29 mutants were tested in microtiter plates for acidification profile and phage resistance. Two microtiter plates were prepared with milk and each plate was inoculated with 2% of the respective mutant. For one plate, 2% peptone-salt diluent (control) was added to each well, and to the other microtiter plate 2% CHPC658 containing 10E06 phage particles per ml was added. The two plates were incubated at 37° C. for two days, and pH of each well was recorded every 12 minutes. All mutants were phage resistant compared to the mother strain CHCC10019, which was attacked by phage CHPC658. Twelve mutants were chosen based on the acidification profile in MRS and milk (similar to the mother strain) and the viscosity of the strains. Analysis of CHCC10019 Phage Resistant Mutants for Texture Properties in Fermented Milk After incubating the twelve mutants and mother strain CHCC10019 over night in milk at 37° C., the fermented milk was adjusted to 13° C. and stirred gently by means of a stick fitted with a disc containing holes until homogeneity of each sample. The rheological properties of each sample was assessed on a rheometer (StressTech, Reologica Instruments, Sweden) equipped with a C25 coaxial measuring system. The viscometry test was made with shear rates varying from 0.27 to 300 1/s in 21 steps. Shear rates were increased and then decreased and the upward and downward curves of shear stress and apparent viscosity were recorded. Delay and integration times were 5 s and 10 s, respectively. For further analysis, shear stress at 300 s−1 was chosen. The results from the rheology measurements showed that all twelve mutants (such as CHCC12813 and CHCC12841) had an improved viscosity, measured as shear stress, compared to CHCC10019. The highest shear stress value was obtained for CHCC12841 (74.0 Pa) whereas CHCC10019 had a shear stress value of 58.0 Pa, see FIG. 2. On the figure, the rheology data for the twelve phage resistant mutants is shown. All mutants have an increase in shear stress ranging from 10% up to 28% compared to CHCC10019. Based on acidification activity and rheology data when the mutants were grown in co-culture with other strains CHCC12813 was selected as most promising candidate of the isolated mutants for further application tests. This experiment demonstrates that the important rheological parameter shear stress of a bacterial strain will be significantly improved by isolating phage resistant mutants of the strain. Example 3 Isolation of Phage Resistant Mutants of Streptococcus thermophilus Strain CHCC9204 From the mother strain CHCC9204, registered in Chr. Hansen culture collection, a phage resistant mutant was isolated. The mutant was isolated on M17-2% lactose agar plates with 10 mM MgCl2/CaCl2 after plating 0.1 ml of an M17 lactose over night culture of CHCC9204 together with 0.1 ml of phage CHPC1057 containing 1×10exp09 phage particles per ml and incubation overnight at 37° C. Among several mutants one strain, called CHCC12339, was three times colony purified and retested in plaque test on M17 lactose agar plates at 37° C. using phage CHPC1057 for phage challenge, and phage resistance was confirmed (no single plaques observed in plaque test). CHCC12339 was also tested in milk showing an acidification activity comparable to the mother strain. Analysis of Texture Properties of Phage Resistant Mutant CHCC12339 in Fermented Milk After mutant CHCC12339 and mother strain CHCC9204 were incubated over night in milk at 37° C., the fermented milk was brought to 13° C. and stirred gently by means of a stick fitted with a bored disc until homogeneity of each sample. The rheological properties of each sample was assessed on a rheometer (StressTech, Reologica Instruments, Sweden) equipped with a C25 coaxial measuring system. The viscometry test was made with shear rates varying from 0.27 to 300 1/s in 21 steps. Shear rates were increased and then decreased and the upward and downward curves of shear stress and apparent viscosity were recorded. Delay and integration times were 5 s and 10 s, respectively. For further analysis, shear stress at 300 s−1 was chosen. The results from the rheology measurements showed that mutant CHCC12339 leads to an increase of gel stiffness (G*) by 22% compared to CHCC9204, see FIG. 3. On the figure, the gel stiffness values (G*) for the phage resistant mutant CHCC12339 (78.0 Pa) and mother strain CHCC9204 (64.0 Pa) are compared. Example 4 Isolation of Phage Resistant Mutants of Streptococcus thermophilus Strain CHCC5086 From the mother strain CHCC5086, registered in Chr. Hansen culture collection, a phage resistant mutant was isolated. The mutant was isolated on M17-2% lactose agar plates with 10 mM MgCl2/CaCl2 after plating 0.1 ml of an M17-2% lactose over night culture of CHCC5086 together with 0.1 ml of phage CHPC1089 containing 1×10exp08 phage particles per ml and incubation overnight at 37° C. Among several mutants one strain, called CHCC13140, was three times colony purified and retested in plaque on M17 lactose agar plates at 37° C. test using phage CHPC1089 for phage challenge, and phage resistance was confirmed (no single plaques observed in plaque test). CHCC13140 was also tested in milk acidification test showing an acidification activity comparable to the mother strain. Analysis of Texture Properties of Phage Resistant Mutant CHCC13140 in Fermented Milk After mutant CHCC13140 and mother strain CHCC5086 were incubated over night in milk at 37° C., the fermented milk was brought to 13° C. and stirred gently by means of a stick fitted with a bored disc until homogeneity of each sample. The rheological properties of each sample was assessed on a rheometer (StressTech, Reologica Instruments, Sweden) equipped with a C25 coaxial measuring system. The viscometry test was made with shear rates varying from 0.27 to 300 1/s in 21 steps. Shear rates were increased and then decreased and the upward and downward curves of shear stress and apparent viscosity were recorded. Delay and integration times were 5 s and 10 s, respectively. For further analysis, shear stress at 300 s−1 was chosen. The results from the rheology measurements showed that mutant CHCC13140 leads to an increase of shear stress by 14% compared to CHCC5086, see FIG. 4. On the figure, the shear stress data for the phage resistant mutant CHCC13140 (shear stress 33.0 Pa) and mother strain CHCC5086 (28.0 Pa) are compared. Example 5 Preparation of a Galactose Positive Mutant of a Streptococcus Strain General Method for Obtaining Gal+ Strains Prior to the mutant isolation the mother strain (e.g. CHCC6008) were streaked on M17 agar plates with 2% galactose (M17-gal plates). CHCC6008 did not grow on galactose as sole carbohydrate source, and thus the mother stain is considered to be gal−. Over night cultures of the mother strain were then plated on M17-gal plates and several colonies could be isolated after two days of growth at 37° C. Several mutants were purified on M17-gal plates and retested in M17 broth containing 2% galactose as sole carbohydrate. A mutant may be obtained by means of e.g. genetic engineering, radiation and/or chemical treatment, or the mutant may be a spontaneous mutant. A mutant was considered galactose positive when the pH was reduced by a value of at least 1.0 after 16 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. in M17 with 2% galactose (galactose added as sole carbohydrate), inoculated in an amount of at least 10E4 cells pr ml of medium. Whereas CHCC6008 did not lower the pH in M17-gal broth significantly, CHCC11342, one of the purified mutants, reached a pH of 5.4 after 16 hours at 37° C., and was therefore considered a galactose-fermenting (gal+) mutant of CHCC6008. Isolation of Galactose Fermenting Strains Mutants were isolated as galactose fermenting mutant of S. thermophilus strain CHCC6008 (=ST6008, DSM18111). The CHCC6008 cells were neither mutagenized with any mutagenic compound nor by UV light prior to the mutant isolation step. The isolated strains resemble therefore spontaneous galactose positive mutants of CHCC6008. Prior to the mutant isolation CHCC6008 was streaked on M17 agar plates with 2% galactose (M17-gal plates). CHCC6008 did not grow on galactose as sole carbohydrate source. Over night culture of CHCC6008 were then plated on M17-gal plates and several colonies could be isolated after two days of growth at 37° C. Several mutants were purified on M17-gal plates and retested in M17 broth containing 2% galactose as sole carbohydrate. Whereas CHCC6008 did not lower the pH in M17-gal broth significantly, CHCC11379, one of the purified mutants, reached a pH of 5.3 after 10 hours at 37° C., and was therefore considered a galactose-fermenting mutant from CHCC6008. Strains CHCC11342 and CHCC11976 were isolated the same way. Isolation of Mutants by Genetic Engineering Galactose positive mutants can also be generated by site directed mutagenesis. Oligonucleotides carrying the mutated nucleotide within the galK −10 promoter box is used to amplify a specific DNA fragment by PCR. The PCR fragment carrying the desired mutation is cloned into a vector plasmid and transformed into the S. thermophilus target strain, and the mutation is integrated into the chromosome and exchanging the wild type galK promoter region by recombination. Isolation of strains is done as above. Analysis of Texture in Fermented Milk The day after incubation, the fermented milk was brought to 13° C. and stirred gently by means of a stick fitted with a bored disc until homogeneity of the sample. The rheological properties of the sample were assessed on a rheometer (StressTech, Reologica Instruments, Sweden) equipped with a C25 coaxial measuring system. The viscometry test was made with shear rates varying from 0.27 to 300 1/s in 21 steps. Shear rates were increased and then decreased and the upward and downward curves of shear stress and apparent viscosity were recorded. Delay and integration times were 5 s and 10 s, respectively. For further analysis, shear stress at 300 s−1 was chosen. The rheometer results showed that CHCC11379 had a shear stress which was improved by 10% compared to CHCC6008 (shear stress value 74.0 Pa (Pascals) for CHCC11379 compared with 67.5 Pa for mother strain CHCC6008. Analysis of Texture in Milk In another experiment CHCC11379 was used as a part of a yoghurt culture where strains from S. thermophilus are co-cultured in skimmed milk at 43° C. together with a strain from the species Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. When the only difference in the production of yoghurt was the use of CHCC11379 instead of wild type CHCC6008 the shear stress was also increased by 10% (105.0 Pa for the yoghurt culture containing CHCC11379 compared with 94.7 Pa for the yoghurt culture containing CHCC6008). Sequencing of the galK Promoter Region from CHCC11379 To reveal the type of mutation for the gal positive mutant CHCC11379 the beginning of the galK gene (coding for the galactokinase from S. thermophilus) was sequenced. For CHCC11379 a mutation in the region of the galK promoter was identified (see below). The respective mutation will most likely lead to a stronger promoter activity compared to the mother strain 6008, explaining the observed gal-positive phenotype. This is based on the fact that the consensus sequence for the −10-promoter box is “TATAAT”, and that a mutation at nucleotide 3 of the −10 box (region) for CHCC6008 (“TACGAT”) leads to a −10 box with a higher similarity to the consensus sequence in CHCC11379 (“TATGAT”). Promoter region of the galK gene from CHCC11379. The point mutation within the CHCC11379 galk promoter is indicated with grey color code. The published galK sequence from S. thermophilus ST111 (Genbank accession no. AY704368) is indicated for comparison. −35: −35-promoter region; −10: −10-promoter region; RBS: ribosome binding site.
