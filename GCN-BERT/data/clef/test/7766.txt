This application is a divisional of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/101,171, which was filed on May 5, 2011. The entire subject matter of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/101,171, is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BACKGROUND The invention relates generally to methods for converting carbon and hydrocarbon cracking and apparatuses for hydrocarbon cracking. More specifically, the invention relates to methods for converting carbon into carbon oxide, and methods and apparatuses for hydrocarbon cracking, in which the build-up of coke deposits are undesirable. In the petrochemical industry, hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, butane, heptane, liquid petroleum gas, naphtha, and gas oil are cracked in apparatuses, in the presence of from about 30 weight percentage to about 70 weight percentage of steam, at temperatures of from about 700 C to about 870 C in order to produce light olefins such as ethylene and propylene. Sometimes, hydrocarbons such as bottoms from atmospheric and vacuum distillation of crude oil are cracked in apparatuses at a temperature in a range from about 480 ° C. to about 600 ° C. in the presence of about 1 wt % to about 2 wt % steam. During hydrocarbon cracking processes, the build-up of carbonaceous deposits (i.e. coke deposits) usually happens on contact surfaces of apparatus components, for instance, inner radiant tube surfaces of furnace equipment. The inner radiant tube surfaces become gradually coated with a layer of coke which raises the radiant tube metal temperature (TMT) and increases the temperature drop through radiant coils. In addition, coke build-up adversely affects the physical characteristics of the apparatus components, such as the radiant tubes, by deteriorating mechanical properties such as stress rupture, thermal fatigue, and ductility. In order to decoke apparatus components, the apparatus must be periodically shut down. Typically, the decoking is carried out by combustion of the coke deposits with steam/air at temperatures of up to 1000 ° C. Such decoking operations are required approximately every 10 to 80 days, depending on the operation mode, types of hydrocarbons, and result in production loss since hydrocarbons feeding must be stopped for such decoking operation. A variety of methods have been considered in order to overcome the disadvantages of coke build-up on apparatus components, such as furnace tube inner surfaces. These approaches include: e.g., catalytic gasification of coke to produce carbon oxide (CO/CO2) and hydrogen. However, till now people are still seeking an effective method for the gasification of coke, i.e., converting carbon into a carbon oxide (CO and/or CO2). Therefore, it is desirable to provide a method for converting carbon into carbon oxide and a method and an apparatus for hydrocarbon cracking, in which the build-up of coke deposits is effectively reduced/mitigated. Carnegieite is the high-temperature form of Na[AlSiO4]-nepheline, which can be prepared by annealing nepheline beyond 1530 K (1256.85 ° C.) with subsequent quenching to room temperature. Intercalation of sodium oxide into Na[AlSiO4]-carnegieite to obtain compounds (Na2O)≦0.33Na[AlSiO4] has been reported in an article titled as Interstitial Cristobalite-type Compounds (Na2O)≦0.33Na[AlSiO4] and published in JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY 61, 40-46 (1986). Na8Al4Si4O18 has also been reported in Beitrage zur Beaktionsfahigkeit der silicate bei niedrigen temperaturen, II. Mitteilung., Die Strukturen Na2O-reicher carnegieite., Von Werner Borchert and Jurgen Keidel, Heidelberg, Mit 6 Textabbildungen, (Eingegangen am 17, Marz 1947). However, there seems no or few, if any, reports about how to use this kind of Na2O intercalated or rich carnegieite-like materials.

EXAMPLES The following examples are included to provide additional guidance to those of ordinary skill in the art in practicing the claimed invention. Accordingly, these examples do not limit the invention as defined in the appended claims. Kaolin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St Louis, Mo. (MO), USA and used without further treatment. NaNO3, Na2CO3, citric acid, triethylene glycol and ethanol were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. Carbon black (99.99% carbon content, ACE Black, AB 50) was obtained from synthetic oil and lubricant of Texas, Inc., Houston, Tex., USA. Material composition was characterized with a wave dispersive x-ray fluorescence (WD XRF) analyzer (Rigaku ZSX 100e, Rigaku Industrial Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Crystal structure was analyzed with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advance, Bniker Axs GmbH Karlsruhe, Germany). Example 1 The carnegieite-like material Na4Si2Al2O9 was prepared with a typical solid reaction as follows. Kaolin (12.9 g), 10.6 g Na2CO3 and 20 g ethanol were mixed together and then ball milled at 500 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 24 hours to become paste. The paste was dried at 80° C. to obtain powder. The powder was calcinated at 850° C. for 6 hours with a temperature increasing rate of 5° C./minute. After calcination, the powder was analyzed using both the WD XRF analyzer and the XRD. Please refer to WD XRF results in table 1, the composition ratio of this material was Na:Si:Al=2:1:1. The XRD analysis identified the Na2O-stabilized (or intercalated or rich) high carnegieite like phase of Na4Si2Al2O9 powder. TABLE 1 element Na Si Al amount (mol) 1.00 0.50 ± 0.01 0.50 ± 0.01 Example 2 Na4Si2Al2O9 powders (300 mg) obtained in example 1 were ground in an agate mortar and then thoroughly mixed with carbon black powder (30 mg) (weight ratio 10:1) to be used as sample 1. Carbon black powder (30 mg) was used as sample 2. Each of the samples 1 and 2 was placed in a quartz crucible, which was then hung vertically in the reaction area of a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) furnace (TG 151, from Cahn Instruments, Inc., Cerritos, Calif., USA). A constant flow of helium passed through a preheating furnace at 700° C. and carried 50 wt% of distilled water steam to enter the TGA furnace. The temperature in the TGA furnace was increased linearly at a rate of 10° C/minute from 25° C. and held at a constant temperature of 400° C. until the balance disturbance arising from steam was eliminated and a steady weight recording was achieved. Temperature then continued to increase to 950° C. at a programmed temperature rise of 5° C./minute. The weights of the samples were recorded at different temperatures after a steady weight recording was achieved. The weight reduction percentages of carbon black in the samples during the experiment were calculated out and are shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 1, broken line 1 represents weight reduction percentages of carbon black in the sample 1 at different temperatures while solid line 2 represents weight reduction percentages of carbon black in the sample 2 at different temperatures. Gases from the TGA furnace passed through a chiller and desiccation vessel (packed with CaCl2) connected to a gas cell mounted in a Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (NicoletTm 380 FT-IR spectrometer from Thermo Electron Scientific Instruments Corp., Madison, Wis., USA). The concentrations of carbon dioxide in the gases obtained through the FT-IR spectrometer at different temperatures are shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 2, broken line 1 represents concentrations of carbon dioxide generated from sample 1 at different temperatures while solid line 2 represents concentrations of carbon dioxide generated from sample 2 at different temperatures. As shown in FIG. 1, weight reduction percentages of carbon black in the sample 1 (Na4Si2Al2O9-carbon black mixture) rise with the increase of temperatures, especially in the temperature range from about 500° C. to about 950° C. However, weight reduction percentages of carbon black in the sample 2 remain at approximately 0 during the experiment. As shown in FIG. 2, concentration of carbon dioxide generated from the sample 1, in the temperature range of the experiment of 400° C. to 950° C., especially from about 450° C. to about 950° C., when exposed in the helium-steam mixture, rise with the increase of temperatures, while concentration of carbon dioxide venerated from the sample 2 remains at approximately 0 during the experiment. FIGS. 1 and 2 show that carbon black weight reduction and carbon dioxide concentration of the sample 1 increased dramatically with the rise of temperature in the range of from about 750° C.. to about 950° C. This experiment suggests that the Na2O-stabilized (or intercalated or rich) high carnegieite like Na4Si2Al2O9 is effective for catalyzing the reaction between carbon and steam in the temperature range of 400° C. to 950° C., especially from about 450° C. to about 950° C., to convert carbon into carbon oxide, and is especially effective in the temperature range of from about 750° C. to about 950° C. Example 3 Two disks of 1 mm thickness and 10 mm diameter pressed from Na2O-stabilized (or intercalated or rich) high carnegieite like Na4Si2Al2O9 powders obtained in example 1 and one piece of Al2O3 pellet (5 mm ×5 mm ×1 mm) were used as samples and stayed in a lab scale cracking furnace filled with heptane/steam mixture (weight ratio: 1:1) at 800° C. +/− 5° C. for 8 hours. The residence time of the heptane/steam mixture in the cracking furnace was 1.5 seconds. No coke deposit was observed on surfaces of the two Na4Si2Al2O9 disks, while coke deposits were observed on the Al2O3 pellet. This experiment suggests that the Na2O-stabilized (or intercalated or rich) high carnegieite like Na4Si7Al2O9 may be used for hydrocarbon cracking where coke deposits are undersirable. The XRD results of the Na4Si2Al2O9 disks before and after the experiment demonstrated that this Na2O-stabilized (or intercalated or rich) high carnegieite like material was rather stable during the experiment. Example 4 A coupon made from alloy 310S (composition of which is shown in table 2) with the dimension of 10×30×1 mm3 was used as the substrate. Before coating, the substrate was cleaned carefully as follows: ultrasonic agitation in acetone and ethanol for 30 minutes, respectively, to remove organic contaminants, ultrasonic agitation in HC1 (3.3 wt %) for 30 minutes to etch the substrate surface, ultrasonically rinsing in deionized water, and finally dried completely by compressed air.

Glycerol (0.4 g) was added into the mixture. Then the mixture was blended with high-speed mixer (Speedmixer™ DAC 150FVC, Flacktek Inc., Landrum, S.C., USA) at 4000 rpm for 1 minute and became slurry. Dipped the alloy substrate into the slurry to cover the coupon surface to be coated with the slurry. Dried the coupon in air for 2 hours and then calcined it at 800° C. in argon atmosphere for 2 hours. XRD results identified the Na2O-stabilized (or intercalated or rich) high carnegieite like phase of Na4Si2Al2O9 in the film on the alloy substrate. Example 4 The coated alloy coupon obtained in example 3 was then used as a sample and stayed in the cracking furnace at 860° C. for 5 hours in the heptane/steam (1:1 weight ratio) mixture. The residence time of the heptanelsteam mixture in the cracking furnace was 1.5 seconds. No coke deposit was observed on the Na4Si2Al2O9 film after the experiment. Energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS, Inca X-sight, Oxford Instruments, Oxfordshire, UK) analysis was performed after the experiment and confirmed that no carbon can be identified on the surface of the Na4Si2Al2O9 film. However, coke deposits were observed on the blank section of the alloy substrate without the Na4Si2Al2O9 film. This experiment suggests that the Na4Si2Al2O9 film is effective for eliminating coke deposits when the heptane was cracked in the presence of steam. While only certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art.
