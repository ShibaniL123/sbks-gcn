DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 8 thereof, a new illuminated head-gear device embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described. As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 8, the illuminated head-gear assembly 10 generally comprises a cap 12 to be worn on a user's head 14. A plurality of air apertures 16 extends through a top 18 of the cap 12 so air may escape from between the user's head 14 and the cap 12. The cap 12 may be comprised of a deformable material. Additionally, the cap 12 may resemble a baseball cap 20 of any conventional design. A plurality of first fasteners 22 is coupled to an inside surface 24 of a front 26 of the cap 12 proximate a bottom edge 28 of the cap 12. The plurality of first fasteners 22 is evenly distributed between a first lateral side 30 and a second lateral side 32 of the cap 12. A retainer 34 is removably coupled to the inside surface 24 of the front 26 of the cap 12. The retainer 34 may have a length between 17 cm and 23 cm. A plurality of second fasteners 36 is coupled to a front 38 of the retainer 34 so the plurality of second fasteners 36 is evenly distributed between a first end 40 and a second end 42 of the retainer 34. The first 22 and second 36 fasteners are complementary so the retainer 34 is removably coupled to the inside surface 24 of the front 26 of the cap 12 such that a free portion 44 of the retainer 34 extends forwardly from the front 26 of the cap 12. The first 22 and second 36 fasteners may comprise hook and loop fasteners of any conventional design. A brim 46 is positionable on the retainer 34 so a rear 48 of the brim 46 insertably receives the free portion 44 of the retainer 34. The rear 48 of the brim 46 is curvilinear with the front 26 of the cap 12 so the rear 48 of the brim 46 abuts an entire width of the front 26 of the cap 12. The brim 46 extends forwardly from the front 26 of the cap 12 so the brim 46 may shade the user's face 50. Additionally, the brim 46 may have a length. between 12 cm and 18 cm and a width between 17 cm and 23 cm. A third fastener 52 is coupled to an inside surface 54 of a rear 56 of the cap 12 proximate the bottom edge 28 of the cap 12. The third fastener 52 is one of a pair of third fasteners 52 each positioned proximate an associated one of opposite sides 58 of an opening 60 in the rear 56 of the cap 12. The third fastener 52 may comprise a hook and loop fastener. A strap 62 is removably coupled to the cap 12 so the strap 62 adjusts a size of the cap 12. The strap 62 may have a length between 5 cm and 8 cm. The strap 62 is one of a pair of straps 62 each being positionable proximate an associated one of the opposites sides 58 of the opening 60 in the rear 56 of the cap 12.

The top light emitter 29 may comprise an LED of any conventional design capable of emitting a plurality of colors of light. A motion sensor 31 is coupled to the top 18 of the cap 12 and the motion sensor 31 is electrically coupled to the front light emitter 27, the top light emitter 29 and the plurality of strap light emitters 76. The motion sensor 31 detects when the cap 12 is in motion so the motion detector 31 may selectively actuate the front 27, top 29, and plurality of strap light emitters 76. The motion sensor 31 de-actuates the front 27, top 29 and plurality of strap light emitters 76 if the motion sensor 31 ceases to detect motion. An actuator 33 is coupled to an inside surface 35 of the first lateral side 30 of the cap 12 proximate the bottom edge 28 of the cap 12 and the actuator 33 is actuated by the user 49.

A power supply 37 is coupled to the inside surface 35 of the first lateral side 30 of the cap 12 proximate the bottom edge 28 of the cap 12. The power supply 37 is electrically coupled to the actuator 33 and the power supply 37 may comprise at least one battery 39. The power supply 37 may have an operational voltage between 3 volts DC and 6 volts DC A pair of second contacts 41 is coupled to the inside surface 54 of the rear 56 of the cap 12. The pair of second contacts 41 is electrically coupled to the motion sensor 31. Additionally, the pair of second contacts 41 is one of a pair of sets of the pairs of second contacts 41. Each of a first 43 and a second 45 set of the pair of second contacts 41 is positioned proximate an associated one of the opposite sides 58 of the opening 60 in the rear 56 of the cap 12. Further, each of the first 43 and second 45 sets of the pair of second contacts 41 is selectively electrically coupled to an associated one of the first set 78 and a second set 47 of the pair of first contacts 72 when an associated one of the first 64 and the second 66 straps is removably coupled to the cap 12. In use, the user 49 selects a color of the first 86 and second 17 sleeves to position on the brim 46. The first sleeve 86 may be used with or without the second sleeve 17 and the support 23. Additionally, the user 49 selects a color of the first 64 and second 66 straps to be coupled to the rear 56 of the cap 12. The cap 12 may be worn with or without the top light emitter 29. Alternatively, the first sleeve 86 may be positioned on a brim 46 that is permanently affixed to the cap 12 to alter the appearance of the brim 46 that is permanently affixed to the cap 12.
