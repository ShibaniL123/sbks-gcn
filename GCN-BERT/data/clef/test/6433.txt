CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/953,020, filed Mar. 14, 2014, which is incorporated herein. BACKGROUND The invention is directed to formulating hot melt adhesive compositions that include polypropylene and ethylene copolymer. Hot melt adhesive compositions are solid at room temperature and melt at higher temperatures. Hot melt adhesive compositions are often made from a variety of different base polymers including amorphous polyalphaolefins and ethylene vinyl acetate. Many amorphous polypropylene polymers exhibit a long open time, are quite tacky immediately after solidifying from a molten state, and remain tacky for an undesirable period of time after solidifying. These properties are undesirable for applications that require short open times and non-tacky properties after solidification. It is often difficult to formulate hot melt adhesive compositions that include both polypropylene and ethylene vinyl acetate as the base polymers and that exhibit suitable adhesive properties. One reason for this difficulty is that ethylene vinyl acetate tends to be incompatible with polypropylene. It would be useful to formulate a hot melt adhesive composition that exhibits good bonding properties at a low coat weight and in which the base polymer of the formulation can be changed while maintaining good adhesive properties.

Uses The hot melt adhesive composition can be applied to or incorporated in a variety of articles including, e.g., films (e.g., polyolefin films (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), polyester film, metalized polymer film, multi-layer film, and combinations thereof), fibers, substrates made from fibers (e.g., virgin fibers, recycled fibers, synthetic polymer fibers (e.g., nylon, rayon, polyesters, acrylics, polypropylenes, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane), cellulose fibers (e.g., natural cellulose fibers such as wood pulp), natural fibers (e.g., cotton, silk and wool), and glass fibers, and combinations thereof), release liners, porous substrates, cellulose substrates, sheets (e.g., paper, and fiber sheets), paper products, woven and nonwoven webs (e.g., webs made from fibers (e.g., yarn, thread, filaments, microfibers, blown fibers, and spun fibers) perforated films, and combinations thereof), tape backings, and combinations thereof. The hot melt adhesive composition is useful for bonding a variety of substrates including, e.g., cardboard, coated cardboard, paperboard, fiber board, virgin and recycled kraft, high and low density kraft, chipboard, treated and coated kraft and chipboard, and corrugated versions of the same, clay coated chipboard carton stock, composites, leather, polymer (e.g., polyolefin (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), polyvinylidene chloride films, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyester, styrene, and polyamide), polymer film (e.g., polyolefin films (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), polyvinylidene chloride films, ethylene vinyl acetate films, polyester films, metalized polymer film, multi-layer film, and combinations thereof), fibers and substrates made from fibers (e.g., virgin fibers, recycled fibers, synthetic polymer fibers, cellulose fibers, and combinations thereof), release liners, porous substrates (e.g., woven webs, nonwoven webs, and perforated films), cellulose substrates, sheets (e.g., paper, and fiber sheets), paper products, tape backings, and combinations thereof. Useful composites include, e.g., chipboard laminated to metal foil (e.g., aluminum foil), which optionally can be laminated to at least one layer of polymer film, chipboard bonded to film, Kraft bonded to film (e.g., polyethylene film), and combinations thereof. The hot melt adhesive composition is useful for bonding a first substrate to a second substrate in a variety of applications and constructions including, e.g., packaging, bags, boxes, cartons, cases, trays, multi-wall bags, articles that include attachments (e.g., straws attached to drink boxes), ream wrap, cigarettes (e.g., plug wrap), filters (e.g., pleated filters and filter frames), bookbinding, footwear, disposable absorbent articles (e.g., disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, medical dressings (e.g., wound care products), bandages, surgical pads, drapes, gowns, and meat-packing products), paper products including, e.g., paper towels (e.g., multiple use towels), toilet paper, facial tissue, wipes, tissues, towels (e.g., paper towels), sheets, mattress covers, and components of absorbent articles including, e.g., an absorbent element, absorbent cores, impermeable layers (e.g., backsheets), tissue (e.g., wrapping tissue), acquisition layers and woven and nonwoven web layers (e.g., top sheets, absorbent tissue), and combinations thereof. The hot melt adhesive composition is also useful in forming laminates of porous substrates and polymer films such as those used in the manufacture of disposable articles including, e.g., medical drapes, medical gowns, sheets, feminine hygiene articles, diapers, adult incontinence articles, absorbent pads (e.g., for animals (e.g., pet pads) and humans (e.g., bodies and corpses)), and combinations thereof.

In on demand hot melt application systems (which are also referred to as “tank free” and “tankless” systems), hot melt compositions are fed in a solid state (e.g., pellets), to a relatively small heating vessel (relative to traditional hot melt applications systems that include a pot) where the hot melt composition is melted and, typically shortly thereafter, the molten liquid is applied to a substrate. In on demand systems, a relatively large quantity of hot melt composition typically does not remain in a molten state for an extended period of time. In many existing on demand systems, the volume of molten hot melt composition is no greater than about I liter, or even no greater than about 500 milliliters, and the hot melt composition is maintained in a molten state for a relatively brief period of time, including, e.g., less than two hours, less than one hour, or even less than 30 minutes. Suitable on demand hot melt adhesive application systems include, e.g., InvisiPac Tank-Free Hot Melt Delivery System from Graco Minnesota Inc. (Minneapolis, Minn.) and the Freedom Hot Melt Dispensing System from Nordson Corporation (Westlake, Ohio). On demand hot melt adhesive application systems are described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2013-0105039, 2013-0112709, 2013-0112279, and 2014-0042182, and U.S. Pat. No. 8,201,717, and incorporated herein. The invention will now be described by way of the following examples. All parts, ratios, percentages, and amounts stated in the Examples are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLES Test Procedures Test procedures used in the examples include the following. The procedures are conducted at room temperature (i.e., an ambient temperature of from about 20° C. to about 25° C.) unless otherwise specified. Viscosity Test Method Viscosity is determined in accordance with ASTM D-3236 entitled, “Standard Test Method for Apparent viscosity of Hot Melt Adhesives and Coating Materials,” (Oct. 31, 1988), using a Brookfield viscometer, a Brookfield Thermosel heated sample chamber, and a number 27 spindle. The results are reported in centipoise (cps). Fiber Tear Test Method The percentage fiber tear is the percentage of fiber that covers the area of the adhesive after two substrates, which have been previously bonded together through the adhesive, are separated by force. The percentage of fiber tear exhibited by an adhesive composition is determined as follows. A bead of the adhesive composition measuring 15.24 cm (6 inch)×0.24 cm ( 3/32 inch) is applied to a first substrate of ROCKTENN 44 pound 87% virgin liner board, using a ROCKTENN bond simulator at the specified application temperature. Two seconds after the bead of adhesive is applied to the first substrate, the bead of adhesive is contacted with a second substrate of ROCKTENN 44 pound 87% virgin liner board, which is pressed against the adhesive and the first substrate with a pressure of 0.21 MPa (30 pounds per square inch (psi)) for a period of 2 seconds. The resulting constructions are then conditioned at room temperature for at least 4 hours and then conditioned at the specified test temperature for at least 12 hours. The substrates of the construction are then separated from one another at the conditioning temperature (e.g., immediately after removing the sample from the conditioning chamber) by pulling the two substrates apart from one another by hand. The surface of the adhesive composition is observed and the percent of the surface area of the adhesive composition that is covered by fibers is determined and recorded. A minimum of five samples are prepared and tested for each hot melt adhesive composition. The results are reported in units of % fiber tear. Set Time Test Method A bead of adhesive composition measuring 15.24 cm (6 inch)×0.24 cm ( 3/32 inch) is applied to a first substrate of ROCKTENN 44 pound 87% virgin liner board, using a ROCKTENN bond simulator at the specified application temperature. A timer is started as the bead is applied to the first substrate. 0.4 seconds after the bead of adhesive is applied to the first substrate, the bead of adhesive is contacted with a second substrate of ROCKTENN 44 pound 87% virgin liner board, which is pressed against the adhesive and the first substrate with a pressure of 0.21 MPa (30 pounds per square inch (psi)) for a period of 0.4 seconds. When the timer is at 3 seconds, the now formed bond is pulled apart. If the bond results in less than 100% fiber failure, another bond is made and pulled after 3.5 seconds. In this manner, the amount of time that is allowed to elapse prior to pulling the bond is increased in 0.5 second increments until the set time is arrived upon. The set time is the shortest amount of time in which a pulled bond results in 100% fiber failure. Once a set time is achieved, the test is repeated one more time to confirm the result. If the bond gives 100% fiber failure at 3 seconds, the set time is recorded as no greater than 3 seconds. The results are reported in seconds (s). Heat Stress Resistance Test Method Heat stress resistance is measured according to standard number IOPP T-3006 entitled, “Suggested Test Method for Determining the Heat Stress Resistance of Hot Melt Adhesives,” using a starting temperature of 46° C. (115° F.) and five bonded samples per adhesive. After 24 hours, the number of samples that are no longer supporting the weight is recorded, and the temperature is increased. The pass temperature for each adhesive, which is defined as the maximum temperature at which 80% of the samples remain bonded, is the heat stress resistance and is reported in degrees Celsius (° C.). Tensile Test Method Tensile properties are determined using ASTM D638 modified by the film thickness and aging time. Films of each sample are created by using a draw down square, which is preheated to 350° F. (177° C.), with a cut out of 40 mils, which when cooled provides a sample film thickness of 25 mils. Each sample is heated to 350° F. (177° C.), poured onto a Teflon board, and quickly drawn down using the square. Once cooled, the thickness of each film is measured using a micrometer. The target film thickness is 25 mils+/−5 mils, where 1 mil is equal to 0.001 inch (0.00254 mm). Tensile specimens are punched out of the film using a Type IV dog bone die. The thickness of the film specimen is not to vary by greater than 1 mil along the gauge length of a given specimen. Specimens are aged at room temperature for at least 12 hours prior to testing. The specimens are run on an INSTRON 4502 at 23° C., 50% relative humidity, and 2 inch/min extension rate. A calibrated 100 N INSTRON static load cell is used to quantify the force and an INSTRON 2663-821 Advanced Video Extensometer, calibrated using a custom calibration bar, is used to measure the change in the gauge length. BLUE HILL 2 software is used for data acquisition and analysis. Strain at break is calculated according to the portion of ASTM D638 pertaining to “percent elongation at break” and is reported in percent (%). Maximum tensile strength is calculated according to the portion of ASTM D638 pertaining to “tensile strength” and is reported in megaPascals (MPa). Energy to break is calculated by integration of the stress-strain curve, and is reported in Joules (J). Gardner Color A sample is conditioned according to the thermal conditioning procedure set forth in ASTM D-1544 and then tested (in the molten state) to determine Gardner color by comparing the color of the sample against the Gardner Color Standards set forth in ASTM D-1544. The comparison is made using a Gardner Delta Comparator equipped with an Illuminator available from Pacific Scientific (Bethesda, Md.). The result is reported as the number corresponding to the Gardner Color Standard. Examples 1-16 The hot melt adhesive compositions of Examples 1-16 were prepared by combining LINXAR 127 propylene-hexene copolymer (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston, Tex.), an ethylene copolymer, and at least one of tackifying resin, wax, oil and antioxidant in the amounts and of the types specified in Tables 1-3 and heating the same to from 175° C. to 180° C. with mixing. The hot melt adhesive compositions of Examples 1-16 were tested according to the Viscosity test method at 177° C., and the Gardner Color, Strain at Break, Tensile Strength, Energy to Break, Peel Adhesion Failure Temperature, Fiber Tear and Set Time test methods. The results are reported in Tables 1-3. The hot melt adhesive compositions of Examples 4, 5, 10, 13, and 14 were also tested according to the Heat Stress Resistance test method during which the oven temperature was increased to the following temperatures every 24 hours from a starting temperature of 46° C.: 52° C. (125° F.), 57° C. (135° F.), 60° C. (140° F.), 63° C. (145° F.), and 66° C. (150° F.). The results are reported in Tables 1-3.
