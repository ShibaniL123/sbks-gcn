EXAMPLE 1- Preparation of 1-(2-(4-(2-furoyl)piperazinyl)ethyl)-1,4-dihydro-7-methoxy-4,4-dimethylchromeno[4,3-c]pyrazole
1-(2-Furoyl)piperazine (12 mg, 0.06 mmol) and K2CO3 (27 mg, 0.19 mmol) dissolved in THF was stirred at room temperature for 10 min. A solution of 1-(2-bromoethyl)-7-methoxy-4,4-dimethyl-1,4-dihydrochromeno[4,3-c]pyrazole (22 mg, 0.06 mmol) in THF was added to the mixture and heated at reflux overnight. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The crude oil dissolved in EtOAc was washed with water, dried over MgSO4, and after filtration the solvent was evaporated. 1-(2-(4-(2-Furoyl)piperazinyl)ethyl)-1,4-dihydro-7-methoxy-4,4-dimethylchromene [4,3-c] pyrazole was isolated by medium pressure chromatography (7 mg, 25%);
