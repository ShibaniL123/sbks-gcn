No. 12/601,752, filed Mar. 1, 2010, which is the U.S. National Phase of International Patent Application No. PCT/IB2008/003131, filed May 23, 2008, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/924,675, filed May 25, 2007.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is related to transcription factors for modifying plant metabolism, and to nucleic acid molecules that encode such transcription factors. The invention relates, inter alia, to nucleic acid sequences that encode transcription factors that regulate alkaloid production in plants, particularly but not exclusively nicotinic alkaloid production in a tobacco plant, and for producing plants and cells with altered alkaloid content. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many plant natural products have biological activities that make them valuable as pharmaceutical drugs. Alkaloids are a class of natural products that have proved particularly useful as drugs and medicines. Examples of biologically-active alkaloids include morphine, scopolamine, camptothecin, cocaine and nicotine. These compounds are all isolated from plant sources for use as pharmaceutical drugs. Nicotine, morphine (and related opiates) and cocaine are also addictive drugs that are responsible for significant health and societal problems worldwide. Nicotine is a pyrrolidine alkaloid that exhibits a range of bioactivities, including potent toxicity and nervous system stimulation. In Nicotiana tabacum, N. benthamiana and a number of other species, nicotine is synthesized in the roots and then transported to the leaves, where it appears to play a role in defense. The biosynthesis of nicotine and many other plant metabolites can be induced by the application of a class of volatile plant hormones collectively termed jasmonates (Gundlach et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89: 2389-2393 (1992)). Although increases in nicotine levels can be induced by wounding or jasmonate application, the actual regulatory machinery responsible for this induction has yet to be discovered. Plant natural product biosynthesis is mainly under transcriptional control, which allows plants to regulate metabolism in a developmental and stress-specific fashion. A number of transcription factors that regulate specific branches of secondary metabolism have been identified in plants. Anthocyanin biosynthesis is controlled by interacting MYB proteins (e.g. maize C1, Arabidopsis PAP1/PAP2) and basic-helix-loop-helix proteins (e.g. maize R, petunia AN1) (for a review see Vom Endt et al., Phytochemistry 61: 107-114 (2002)). Examples of other transcription factors regulating plant metabolic processes include a WRKY-type transcription factor that appears to control the transcription of a sesquiterpene synthase in cotton trichomes (Xu et al., Plant Physiol. 135: 507-515 (2004)) and an AP2/ERF-like transcription factor, WIN1, that up-regulates wax biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Broun et al., Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 7: 202-209 (2004)). Overexpression of ORCA3 in Catharanthus roseus cell suspensions increased levels of transcripts of genes encoding some of the enzymes in the C. roseus terpenoid indole alkaloid pathway, but alkaloid accumulation was observed only when the cell suspension were provided with loganin, a terpenoid precursor. (van der Fits and Memelink. Science 289:295-297 (2000)). Overexpression of two transcription factors, NtORC1 and NtJAP1, increased transient expression of marker genes linked to a putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT) promoter in tobacco cell suspensions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have identified six genes encoding transcription factors that regulate the nicotinic alkaloid biosynthetic pathway. The nucleic acid sequences of the genes have been determined. The full-length sequence of the NbTFJ gene is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. The open reading frame (ORF) of SEQ ID NO: 1, set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, encodes the polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3. The sequence of a portion of the NbTF3 gene, which includes the fragment used for VIGS, is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4. The full-length sequence of the NbTF4 gene, including some sequence that is upstream of the transcriptional start site, is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 5. The ORF of SEQ ID NO: 5, set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6, encodes the polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7. The full-length sequence of the NbTF5 gene is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 8. The ORF of SEQ ID NO: 8, set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9, encodes the polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 10. The full-length sequence of the NbTF6 gene is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 11. The ORF of SEQ ID NO: 11, set forth in SEQ ID NO: 12, encodes the polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 13. The full-length sequence of the NbTF7 gene is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 14. The ORF of SEQ ID NO: 14, set forth in SEQ ID NO: 15, encodes the polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 16. NbTF1, NbTF4, NbTF5. and NbTF6 positively regulates on alkaloid biosynthesis. NbTF3 and NbTF7 negatively regulate alkaloid biosynthesis. The transcription factors belong to several different classes of transcription factors known from plants: NbTF1, NbTF3 and NbTF5 are Myc, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors; NbTF4 is a homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factor; NbTF6 is an AP2, ethylene-response factor; and NbTF7 is a B3 domain, auxin response factor. These transcription factor genes or fragments thereof may be used to suppress synthesis of alkaloids (e.g., of nicotinic alkaloids) in plants that naturally produce the alkaloids. For example, Nicotiana spp. (e.g. N. tabacum, N. rustica and N. benthamiana) naturally produce nicotinic alkaloids. N. tabacum is an agricultural crop of high productivity and biotechnological uses of this plant continue to increase. Reducing nicotine biosynthesis genetic engineering of transcription factor expression leads to creating tobacco varieties that contain zero or low nicotine levels for use as low-toxicity production platforms for the production of plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs) (e.g. recombinant proteins and antibodies) or as industrial, food and biomass crops. The transcription factor genes or fragments thereof may be used in plants or plant cells to increase synthesis of alkaloids (e.g., of nicotinic alkaloids) and related compounds, which may have therapeutic applications. DEFINITIONS All technical terms employed in this specification are commonly used in biochemistry, molecular biology and agriculture; hence, they are understood by those skilled in the field to which this invention belongs. Those technical terms can be found, for example in: MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL 3rd ed., vol. 1-3, ed. Sambrook and Russel, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2001; CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, ed. Ausubel et al., Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1988 (including periodic updates); SHORT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY: A COMPENDIUM OF METHODS FROM CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY 5th ed., vol. 1-2, ed. Ausubel et al., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2002; GENOME ANALYSIS: A LABORATORY MANUAL, vol. 1-2, ed. Green et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1997. Methodology involving plant biology techniques are described here and also are described in detail in treatises such as METHODS IN PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY: A LABORATORY COURSE MANUAL, ed. Maliga et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1995. By “isolated nucleic acid molecule” is intended a nucleic acid molecule, DNA or RNA, which has been removed from its native environment. For example, recombinant DNA molecules contained in a DNA construct are considered isolated for the purposes of the present invention. Further examples of isolated DNA molecules include recombinant DNA molecules maintained in heterologous host cells or DNA molecules that are purified, partially or substantially, in solution. Isolated RNA molecules include in vitro RNA transcripts of the DNA molecules of the present invention. Isolated nucleic acid molecules, according to the present invention, further include such molecules produced synthetically. A “chimeric nucleic acid” comprises a coding sequence or fragment thereof linked to a nucleotide sequence that is different from the nucleotide sequence with which it is associated in cells in which the coding sequence occurs naturally. “Heterologous nucleic acid” refers to a nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, which has been introduced into a cell (or the cell's ancestor) which is not a copy of a sequence naturally found in the cell into which it is introduced. Such heterologous nucleic acid may comprise segments that are a copy of a sequence which is naturally found in the cell into which it has been introduced, or fragments thereof. “Endogenous nucleic acid” or “endogenous sequence” is “native” to, i.e., indigenous to, the plant or organism that is to be genetically engineered. It refers to a nucleic acid, gene, polynucleotide, DNA, RNA, mRNA, or cDNA molecule that is present in the genome of a plant or organism that is to be genetically engineered. “Exogenous nucleic acid” refers to a nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, which has been introduced into a cell (or the cell's ancestor) through the efforts of humans. Such exogenous nucleic acid may be a copy of a sequence which is naturally found in the cell into which it was introduced, or fragments thereof. The terms “encoding” and “coding” refer to the process by which a gene, through the mechanisms of transcription and translation, provides information to a cell from which a series of amino acids can be assembled into a specific amino acid sequence to produce an active enzyme. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, certain base changes in DNA sequence do not change the amino acid sequence of a protein. “Sequence identity” or “identity” in the context of two polynucleotide (nucleic acid) or polypeptide sequences includes reference to the residues in the two sequences which are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified region. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties, such as charge and hydrophobicity, and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. Where sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences which differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have “sequence similarity” or “similarity.” Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, for example, according to the algorithm of Meyers & Miller, Computer Applic. Biol. Sci. 4: 11-17 (1988), as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif., USA). Use in this description of a percentage of sequence identity denotes a value determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. A “variant” is a nucleotide or amino acid sequence that deviates from the standard, or given, nucleotide or amino acid sequence of a particular gene or polypeptide. The terms “isoform,” “isotype,” and “analog” also refer to “variant” forms of a nucleotide or an amino acid sequence. An amino acid sequence that is altered by the addition, removal, or substitution of one or more amino acids, or a change in nucleotide sequence, may be considered a variant sequence. A polypeptide variant may have “conservative” changes, wherein a substituted amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties, e.g., replacement of leucine with isoleucine. A polypeptide variant may have “nonconservative” changes, e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan. Analogous minor variations may also include amino acid deletions or insertions, or both. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues may be substituted, inserted, or deleted may be found using computer programs well known in the art such as Vector NTI Suite (InforMax, MD) software. Variant may also refer to a “shuffled gene” such as those described in Maxygen-assigned patents (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,986). “Genetic engineering” encompasses any methodology for introducing a nucleic acid or specific mutation into a host organism. For example, a plant is genetically engineered when it is transformed with a polynucleotide sequence that suppresses expression of a gene, such that expression of a target gene is reduced compared to a control plant. A plant is genetically engineered when a polynucleotide sequence is introduced that results in the expression of a novel gene in the plant, or an increase in the level of a gene product that is naturally found in the plants. In the present context, “genetically engineered” includes transgenic plants and plant cells, as well as plants and plant cells produced by means of targeted mutagenesis effected, for example, through the use of chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides, as described by Beetham et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96: 8774-8778 (1999) and Zhu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96: 8768-8773 (1999), or so-called “recombinagenic olionucleobases,” as described in International patent publication WO 2003/013226. Likewise, a genetically engineered plant or plant cell may be produced by the introduction of a modified virus, which, in turn, causes a genetic modification in the host, with results similar to those produced in a transgenic plant, as described herein. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,407,956. Additionally, a genetically engineered plant or plant cell may be the product of any native approach (i.e., involving no foreign nucleotide sequences), implemented by introducing only nucleic acid sequences derived from the host plant species or from a sexually compatible plant species. See, e.g., U.S. published patent application No. 2004/0107455. “Promoter” connotes a region of DNA upstream from the start of transcription that is involved in recognition and binding of RNA polymerase and other proteins to initiate transcription. A “constitutive promoter” is one that is active throughout the life of the plant and under most environmental conditions. Tissue-specific, tissue-preferred, cell type-specific, and inducible promoters constitute the class of “non-constitutive promoters.” “Operably linked” refers to a functional linkage between a promoter and a second sequence, where the promoter sequence initiates and mediates transcription of the DNA sequence corresponding to the second sequence. In general, operably linked means that the nucleic acid sequences being linked are contiguous. As used herein, “expression” denotes the production of an RNA product through transcription of a gene or the production of the polypeptide product encoded by a nucleotide sequence. “Overexpression” or “up-regulation” is used to indicate that expression of a particular gene sequence or variant thereof, in a cell or plant, including all progeny plants derived thereof, has been increased by genetic engineering, relative to a control cell or plant (e.g., “NbTF1 overexpression”). The terms “suppression” or “down-regulation” are used synonymously to indicate that expression of a particular gene sequence variant thereof, in a cell or plant, including all progeny plants derived thereof, has been reduced by genetic engineering, relative to a control cell or plant (e.g., “NbTF1 down-regulation”). A “transcription factor” is a protein that binds that binds to DNA regions, typically promoter regions, using DNA binding domains and increases or decreases the transcription of specific genes. A transcription factor “positively regulates” alkaloid biosynthesis if expression of the transcription factor increases the transcription of one or more genes encoding alkaloid biosynthesis enzymes and increases alkaloid production. A transcription factor “negatively regulates” alkaloid biosynthesis if expression of the transcription factor decreases the transcription of one or more genes encoding alkaloid biosynthesis enzymes and decreases alkaloid production. Transcription factors are classified based on the similarity of their DNA binding domains. (see, e.g. Stegmaier et al., Genome Inform. 15 (2): 276-86 ((2004)). Classes of plant transcription factors include Myc basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors; homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factors; AP2 ethylene-response factor transcription factors; and B3 domain, auxin response factor transcription factors. An “alkaloid” is a nitrogen-containing basic compound found in plants and produced by secondary metabolism. A “pyrrolidine alkaloid” is an alkaloid containing a pyrrolidine ring as part of its molecular structure, for example, nicotine. Nicotine and related alkaloids are also referred to as pyridine alkaloids in the published literature. A “pyridine alkaloid” is an alkaloid containing a pyridine ring as part of its molecular structure, for example, nicotine. A “nicotinic alkaloid” is nicotine or an alkaloid that is structurally related to nicotine and that is synthesized from a compound produced in the nicotine biosynthesis pathway. Illustrative nicotinic alkaloids include but are not limited to nicotine, nornicotine, anatabine, anabasine, anatalline, N-methylanatabine, N-methylanabasine, myosmine, anabaseine, formylnornicotine, nicotyrine, and cotinine Other very minor nicotinic alkaloids in tobacco leaf are reported, for example, in Hecht et al., Accounts of Chemical Research 12: 92-98 (1979); Tso, T. G., Production, Physiology and Biochemistry of Tobacco Plant. Ideals Inc., Beltsville, Mo. (1990). As used herein “alkaloid content” means the total amount of alkaloids found in a plant, for example, in terms of pg/g dry weight (DW) or ng/mg fresh weight (FW). “Nicotine content” means the total amount of nicotine found in a plant, for example, in terms of mg/g DW or FW. “Plant” is a term that encompasses whole plants, plant organs (e.g. leaves, stems, roots, etc.), seeds, differentiated or undifferentiated plant cells, and progeny of the same. Plant material includes without limitation seeds, suspension cultures, embryos, meristematic regions, callus tissues, leaves, roots, shoots, stems, fruit, gametophytes, sporophytes, pollen, and microspores. “Tobacco” or “tobacco plant” refers to any species in the Nicotiana genus that produces nicotinic alkaloids, including but are not limited to the following: Nicotiana acaulis, Nicotiana acuminata, Nicotiana acuminata var. multzjlora, Nicotiana africana, Nicotiana alata, Nicotiana amplexicaulis, Nicotiana arentsii, Nicotiana attenuata, Nicotiana benavidesii, Nicotiana benthamiana, Nicotiana bigelovii, Nicotiana bonariensis, Nicotiana cavicola, Nicotiana clevelandii, Nicotiana cordifolia, Nicotiana corymbosa, Nicotiana debneyi, Nicotiana excelsior, Nicotiana forgetiana, Nicotiana fragrans, Nicotiana glauca, Nicotiana glutinosa, Nicotiana goodspeedii, Nicotiana gossei, Nicotiana hybrid, Nicotiana ingulba, Nicotiana kawakamii, Nicotiana knightiana, Nicotiana langsdorfi, Nicotiana linearis, Nicotiana longiflora, Nicotiana maritima, Nicotiana megalosiphon, Nicotiana miersii, Nicotiana noctiflora, Nicotiana nudicaulis, Nicotiana obtusifolia, Nicotiana occidentalis, Nicotiana occidentalis subsp. hesperis, Nicotiana otophora, Nicotiana paniculata, Nicotiana pauczjlora, Nicotiana petunioides, Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, Nicotiana quadrivalvis, Nicotiana raimondii, Nicotiana repanda, Nicotiana rosulata, Nicotiana rosulata subsp. ingulba, Nicotiana rotundifolia, Nicotiana rustica, Nicotiana setchellii, Nicotiana simulans, Nicotiana solanifolia, Nicotiana spegauinii, Nicotiana stocktonii, Nicotiana suaveolens, Nicotiana sylvestris, Nicotiana tabacum, Nicotiana thyrsiflora, Nicotiana tomentosa, Nicotiana tomentosifomis, Nicotiana trigonophylla, Nicotiana umbratica, Nicotiana undulata, Nicotiana velutina, Nicotiana wigandioides, and interspecific hybrids of the above. “Tobacco product” refers to a product comprising material produced by a Nicotiana plant, including for example, nicotine gum and patches for smoking cessation, cigarette tobacco including expanded (puffed) and reconstituted tobacco, cigar tobacco, pipe tobacco, cigarettes, cigars, and all forms of smokeless tobacco such as chewing tobacco, snuff, snus and lozenges. “Decreased alkaloid plant’ or “reduced alkaloid plant” encompasses a genetically engineered plant that has a decrease in alkaloid content to a level less than 50%, and preferably less than 10%, 5%, or 1% of the alkaloid content of a control plant of the same species or variety. “Increased alkaloid plant” encompasses a genetically engineered plant that has an increase in alkaloid content greater than 10%, and preferably greater than 50%, 100%, or 200% of the alkaloid content of a control plant of the same species or variety. I. Reducing Alkaloid Production in Plants A. Decreasing Alkaloids by Suppressing a Transcription Factor that Positively Regulates Alkaloid Production. Alkaloid (e.g. nicotine) production may be reduced by suppression of an endogenous gene encoding a transcription factor that positively regulates alkaloid production using the transcription factor gene sequences of the present invention in a number of ways generally known in the art, for example, RNA interference (RNAi) techniques, artificial microRNA techniques, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) techniques, antisense techniques, sense co-suppression techniques and targeted mutagenesis techniques. Accordingly, the present invention provides methodology and constructs for decreasing alkaloid content in a plant, by suppressing a gene encoding a transcription factor that positively regulates alkaloid production, such as NbTF1, NbTF4, NbTF5, and NbTF6. Suppressing more than one gene encoding a transcription factor that positively regulates on alkaloid production may further decrease alkaloids levels in a plant. B. Decreasing Alkaloids by Suppressing a Transcription Factor that Positively Regulates Alkaloid Production and at Least One Alkaloid Biosynthesis Gene. Previous reports indicate that suppressing an alkaloid biosynthesis gene in Nicotiana decreases nicotinic alkaloid content. For example, suppressing QPT reduces nicotine levels. (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,586,661). Suppressing A622 or NBB1 also reduces nicotine levels (see International patent publication WO 2006/109197), as does suppressing PMT (see Chintapakorn and Hamill. Plant Mol. Biol. 53:87-105 (2003)) or MPO (see International patent publications WO 2008/020333 and 2008/008844; Katoh et al., Plant Cell Physiol. 48(3): 550-4 (2007)). Accordingly, the present invention contemplates further decreasing nicotinic alkaloid content by suppressing one or more of A622, NBB1, QPT, PMT and MPO and suppressing a transcription factor that positively regulates alkaloid production. Pursuant to this aspect of the invention, a nucleic acid construct comprising at least a fragment of one or more of NbTF1, NbTF4, NbTF5, and NbTF6 and at least a fragment one or more of A622, NBB1, QPT, PMT, and MPO are introduced into a cell or plant. An illustrative nucleic acid construct may comprise both a fragment of NbTF1 and QPT. C. Decreasing Alkaloids by Overexpressing a Transcription Factor with a Negative Regulatory Effect on Alkaloid Production. Alkaloid (e.g. nicotine) production may be reduced by overexpression of a gene encoding a transcription factor that negatively regulates alkaloid production using the transcription factor gene sequences of the present invention in a number of ways generally known in the art. Accordingly, the present invention provides methodology and constructs for decreasing alkaloid content in a plant, by overexpressing a gene encoding a transcription factor that negatively regulates alkaloid production, such as NbTF3 or NbTF7. Overexpressing more than one gene encoding a transcription factor that negatively regulates alkaloid production may further decrease alkaloids levels in a plant. D. Decreasing Alkaloids by Overexpressing a Transcription Factor that Negatively Regulates Alkaloid Production and Suppression at Least One Alkaloid Biosynthesis Gene. As described in (I)(B) above, it is known that nicotinic alkaloid content can be decreased by suppressing an alkaloid biosynthesis gene. Accordingly, the present invention contemplates further decreasing nicotinic alkaloid content by suppressing one or more of A622, NBB1, QPT, PMT and MPO and overexpressing a transcription factor with a negative regulatory effect on alkaloid production. Pursuant to this aspect of the invention, a nucleic acid construct comprising one or more of NbTF3 or NbTF7 or their ORFs and at least a fragment of one or more of A622, NBB1, QPT, PMT, and MPO are introduced into a cell or plant. An illustrative nucleic acid construct may comprise both the NbTF3 ORF and at least a fragment of QPT. E. Decreasing Alkaloids by Suppressing a Transcription Factor that Negatively Regulates Alkaloid Production and Overexpressing a Transcription Factor that Positively Regulates Alkaloid Production. The present invention further contemplates decreasing nicotinic alkaloid content by suppressing one or more of NbTF1, NbTF4, NbTF5, and NbTF6 and overexpressing one or more of NbTF3 or NbTF7. II. Increasing Alkaloid Production A. Increasing Alkaloids by Overexpressing a Transcription Factor that Positively Regulates Alkaloid Production. The present invention also relates to increasing alkaloids in plants by overexpressing a transcription factor with a positive regulatory effect on alkaloid production. One or more of the NbTF1, NbTF4, NbTF5, and NbTF6 genes or their open reading frames may be used to engineer overproduction of alkaloids, for example nicotinic alkaloids (e.g. nicotine) in plants or plant cells. B. Increasing Alkaloids by Overexpressing a Transcription Factor that Positively Regulates Alkaloid Production and at Least One at Least One Alkaloid Biosynthesis Gene. Alkaloids, such as nicotine, can be increased by overexpressing one or more genes encoding enzymes in the alkaloid biosynthesis pathway. See for example Sato et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98(1):367-72 (2001). The effect of overexpressing PMT alone on nicotine content of leaves was an increase of only 40% despite 4- to 8-fold increases in PMT transcript levels in roots, suggesting that limitations at other steps of the pathway prevented a larger effect. Therefore, the present invention contemplates that overexpressing a transcription factor with a positive regulatory effect on alkaloid production and at least one at least one alkaloid biosynthesis gene, such as PMT, will result in greater alkaloid production than up-regulating the alkaloid biosynthesis gene alone. Pursuant to this aspect of the invention, a nucleic acid construct comprising one or more of NbTF1, NbTF4, NbTF5, and NbTF6 genes or their open reading frames and at least one of A622, NBB1, QPT, PMT, and MPO is introduced into a plant cell. An illustrative nucleic acid construct may comprise, for example, both NbTF1 and PMT. Similarly, for example, a genetically engineered plant overexpressing NbTF1 and PMT may be produced by crossing a transgenic plant overexpressing NbTF1 with a transgenic plant overexpressing PMT. Following successive rounds of crossing and selection, a genetically engineered plant overexpressing NbTF1 and PMT can be selected. C. Increasing Alkaloids by Suppressing a Transcription Factor that Negatively Regulates Alkaloid Production. Alkaloid (e.g. nicotine) production may be increased by suppression of a gene encoding a transcription factor that negatively regulates alkaloid production using the transcription factor gene sequences of the present invention in a number of ways generally known in the art. Accordingly, the present invention provides methodology and constructs for increasing alkaloid content in a plant, by suppressing a gene encoding a transcription factor that negatively regulates alkaloid production, such as NbTF3 or NbTF7. Suppressing more than one gene encoding a transcription factor that negatively regulates alkaloid production may further increase alkaloids levels in a plant. D. Increasing Alkaloids by Suppressing a Transcription Factor that Negatively Regulates Alkaloid Production and Overexpressing at Least One Alkaloid Biosynthesis Gene. As described in (II)(B) above, it is known that nicotinic alkaloid content can be increased by overexpressing an alkaloid biosynthesis gene. Accordingly, the present invention contemplates further increasing nicotinic alkaloid content by overexpressing one or more of A622, NBB1, QPT, PMT and MPO and suppressing a transcription factor with a negative regulatory effect on alkaloid production. Pursuant to this aspect of the invention, a nucleic acid construct comprising at least a fragment of NbTF3 or NbTF7 and one or more of A622, NBB1, QPT, PMT, and MPO are introduced into a cell or plant. An illustrative nucleic acid construct may comprise both a fragment of NbTF3 and QPT. E. Increasing Alkaloids by Overexpressing a Transcription Factor that Positively Regulates Alkaloid Production and Suppressing a Transcription Factor that Negatively Regulates Alkaloid Production. The present invention further contemplates increasing nicotinic alkaloid content by overexpressing one or more of NbTF1, NbTF4, NbTF5, and NbTF6 and suppressing one or more of NbTF3 or NbTF7. III. Altering Content of Minor Alkaloids, Alkaloid Precursors, and Related Compounds It is known that suppression of an alkaloid biosynthesis gene can increase the accumulation of precursor compounds or increase the relative content of minor alkaloids. For example, suppression of PMT in N. tabacum resulted in an increase in anatabine. (Chintapakorn and Hamill. Plant Mol. Biol. 53:87-105 (2003)) Suppression of a cytochrome P450 (littorine hydroxylase/mutase) involved in tropane alkaloid biosynthesis in Hyoscyamus niger resulted in accumulation of the intermediate littorine, which immediately precedes the blocked step (Li et al., Chem. Biol. 13:513-20 (2006)). Up-regulation of the alkaloid pathway by overexpression of a transcription factor that positively regulates alkaloid production or suppression of a transcription factor that negatively regulates alkaloid production, while also suppressing an alkaloid biosynthesis gene can result in a further increase in minor alkaloid, alkaloid precursor, or related compound. Pursuant to this aspect of the invention, a nucleic acid construct comprising one or more of NbTF1, NbTF4, NbTF5, and NbTF6 or their open reading frames and at least a fragment of one of A622, NBB1, QPT, PMT, and MPO is introduced into a plant cell. Alternatively, a nucleic acid construct comprising at least a fragment of NbTF3 or NbTF7 and at least a fragment of one or more of A622, NBB1, QPT, PMT, and MPO are introduced into a cell or plant. An illustrative nucleic acid construct may comprise both a fragment of NbTF3 and a fragment of PMT. IV. Genetic Engineering of Plants and Cells Using Transcription Factor Sequences that Regulate Alkaloid Production Transcription Factor Sequences Transcription factor genes have been identified in several plant species, exemplified by Nicotiana plants. Accordingly, the present invention embraces any nucleic acid, gene, polynucleotide, DNA, RNA, mRNA, or cDNA molecule that is isolated from the genome of a plant species, or produced synthetically, that encodes a transcription factor that regulates alkaloid biosynthesis. The DNA or RNA may be double-stranded or single-stranded. Single-stranded DNA may be the coding strand, also known as the sense strand, or it may be the non-coding strand, also called the anti-sense strand. It is understood to one skilled in the art that transcription factor genes of the present invention include the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 14 and SEQ ID NO: 15, including fragments thereof at least about 21 consecutive nucleotides, which are of a sufficient length as to be useful in induction of gene silencing in plants (Hamilton and Baulcombe, Science 286, 950-952 (1999)). The invention includes as well as nucleic acid molecules comprised of “variants” of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 14, and SEQ ID NO: 15, with one or more bases deleted, substituted, inserted, or added, which variant codes for a polypeptide that regulates alkaloid biosynthesis activity. Accordingly, sequences having “base sequences with one or more bases deleted, substituted, inserted, or added” retain physiological activity even when the encoded amino acid sequence has one or more amino acids substituted, deleted, inserted, or added. Additionally, multiple forms of transcription factors NbTF1, NbTF3, NbTF4, NbTF5, NbTF6 and NbTF7 may exist, which may be due to post-translational modification of a gene product, or to multiple forms of the transcription factor gene. Nucleotide sequences that have such modifications and that code for a transcription factor that regulates alkaloid biosynthesis are included within the scope of the present invention. For example, the poly A tail or 5′- or 3′-end, nontranslated regions may be deleted, and bases may be deleted to the extent that amino acids are deleted. Bases may also be substituted, as long as no frame shift results. Bases also may be “added” to the extent that amino acids are added. It is essential, however, that any such modification does not result in the loss of transcription factor activity that regulates alkaloid biosynthesis. A modified DNA in this context can be obtained by modifying the DNA base sequences of the invention so that amino acids at specific sites in the encoded polypeptide are substituted, deleted, inserted, or added by site-specific mutagenesis, for example. (see Zoller & Smith, Nucleic Acid Res. 10: 6487-500 (1982)). A transcription factor sequence can be synthesized ab initio from the appropriate bases, for example, by using an appropriate protein sequence disclosed herein as a guide to create a DNA molecule that, though different from the native DNA sequence, results in the production of a protein with the same or similar amino acid sequence. Unless otherwise indicated, all nucleotide sequences determined by sequencing a DNA molecule herein were determined using an automated DNA sequencer, such as the Model 3730×1 from Applied Biosystems, Inc. Therefore, as is known in the art for any DNA sequence determined by this automated approach, any nucleotide sequence determined herein may contain some errors. Nucleotide sequences determined by automation are typically at least about 95% identical, more typically at least about 96% to at least about 99.9% identical to the actual nucleotide sequence of the sequenced DNA molecule. The actual sequence can be more precisely determined by other approaches including manual DNA sequencing methods well known in the art. As is also known in the art, a single insertion or deletion in a determined nucleotide sequence compared to the actual sequence will cause a frame shift in translation of the nucleotide sequence such that the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by a determined nucleotide sequence may be completely different from the amino acid sequence actually encoded by the sequenced DNA molecule, beginning at the point of such an insertion or deletion. For the purpose of the invention, two sequences hybridize under stringent conditions when they form a double-stranded complex in a hybridization solution of 6×SSE, 0.5% SDS, 5×Denhardt's solution and 100 ng of non-specific carrier DNA. See Ausubel et al., supra, at section 2.9, supplement 27 (1994). Sequences may hybridize at “moderate stringency,” which is defined as a temperature of 60° C. in a hybridization solution of 6×SSE, 0.5% SDS, 5×Denhardt's solution and 100 ng of non-specific carrier DNA. For “high stringency” hybridization, the temperature is increased to 68° C. Following the moderate stringency hybridization reaction, the nucleotides are washed in a solution of 2×SSE plus 0.05% SDS for five times at room temperature, with subsequent washes with 0.1×SSC plus 0.1% SOS at 60° C. for 1 h. For high stringency, the wash temperature is increased to 68° C. For the purpose of the invention, hybridized nucleotides are those that are detected using 1 ng of a radiolabeled probe having a specific radioactivity of 10,000 cpm/ng, where the hybridized nucleotides are clearly visible following exposure to X-ray film at −70° C. for no more than 72 hours. The present application is directed to such nucleic acid molecules which are at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to a nucleic acid sequence described in any of SEQ ID NO: 1-2. Preferred are nucleic acid molecules which are at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to the nucleic acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 14, and SEQ ID NO: 15. Differences between two nucleic acid sequences may occur at the 5′ or 3′ terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence refers to a comparison made between two molecules using standard algorithms well known in the art and can be determined conventionally using publicly available computer programs such as the BLASTN algorithm. See Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-402 (1997). The present invention further provides nucleic acid molecules comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 14, and SEQ ID NO: 15, which encode a transcription factor polypeptide, wherein the polypeptide has an amino acid sequence that corresponds to SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 13, or SEQ ID NO: 16, and wherein the polypeptide of the invention encompasses amino acid substitutions, additions and deletions that do not alter the function of the transcription factor polypeptide. Methodology for Suppressing a Transcription Factor that Regulates Alkaloid Production In one aspect of the invention, methods and constructs are provided for suppressing a transcription factor that regulates alkaloid production, altering alkaloid levels, and producing plants with altered alkaloid levels. While any method may be used for suppressing a transcription factor that regulates alkaloid production, the present invention contemplates antisense, sense co-suppression, RNAi, artificial microRNA, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), antisense, sense co-suppression, and targeted mutagenesis approaches. RNAi techniques involve stable transformation using RNAi plasmid constructs (Helliwell and Waterhouse, Methods Enzymol. 392:24-35 (2005)). Such plasmids are composed of a fragment of the target gene to be silenced in an inverted repeat structure. The inverted repeats are separated by a spacer, often an intron. The RNAi construct driven by a suitable promoter, for example, the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, is integrated into the plant genome and subsequent transcription of the transgene leads to an RNA molecule that folds back on itself to form a double-stranded hairpin RNA. This double-stranded RNA structure is recognized by the plant and cut into small RNAs (about 21 nucleotides long) called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). siRNAs associate with a protein complex (RISC) which goes on to direct degradation of the mRNA for the target gene. Artificial microRNA (amiRNA) techniques exploit the microRNA (miRNA) pathway that functions to silence endogenous genes in plants and other eukaryotes (Schwab et al., Plant Cell 18:1121-33 (2006); Alvarez et al, Plant Cell 18:1134-51 (2006)). In this method, 21 nucleotide long fragments of the gene to be silenced are introduced into a pre-miRNA gene to form a pre-amiRNA construct. The pre-miRNA construct is transferred into the plant genome using transformation methods apparent to one skilled in the art. After transcription of the pre-amiRNA, processing yields amiRNAs that target genes, which share nucleotide identity with the 21 nucleotide amiRNA sequence. In RNAi silencing techniques, two factors can influence the choice of length of the fragment. The shorter the fragment the less frequently effective silencing will be achieved, but very long hairpins increase the chance of recombination in bacterial host strains. The effectiveness of silencing also appears to be gene dependent and could reflect accessibility of target mRNA or the relative abundances of the target mRNA and the hpRNA in cells in which the gene is active. A fragment length of between 100 and 800 bp, preferably between 300 and 600 bp, is generally suitable to maximize the efficiency of silencing obtained. The other consideration is the part of the gene to be targeted. 5′ UTR, coding region, and 3′ UTR fragments can be used with equally good results. As the mechanism of silencing depends on sequence homology there is potential for cross-silencing of related mRNA sequences. Where this is not desirable a region with low sequence similarity to other sequences, such as a 5′ or 3′ UTR, should be chosen. The rule for avoiding cross-homology silencing appears to be to use sequences that do not have blocks of sequence identity of over 20 bases between the construct and the non-target gene sequences. Many of these same principles apply to selection of target regions for designing amiRNAs. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) techniques are a variation of RNAi techniques that exploits the endogenous-antiviral defenses of plants. Infection of plants with recombinant VIGS viruses containing fragments of host DNA leads to post-transcriptional gene silencing for the target gene. In one embodiment, a tobacco rattle virus (TRV) based VIGS system can be used. Tobacco rattle virus based VIGS systems are described for example, in Baulcombe, Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2: 109-113 (1999); Lu, et al., Methods 30: 296-303 (2003); Ratcliff, et al., The Plant Journal 25: 237-245 (2001); and U.S. Pat. No. 7,229,829. Antisense techniques involve introducing into a plant an antisense oligonucleotide that will bind to the messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by the gene of interest. The “antisense” oligonucleotide has a base sequence complementary to the gene's messenger RNA (mRNA), which is called the “sense” sequence. Activity of the sense segment of the mRNA is blocked by the anti-sense mRNA segment, thereby effectively inactivating gene expression. Application of antisense to gene silencing in plants is described in more detail in Stam et al., Plant J. 21:27-42 (2000). Sense co-suppression techniques involve introducing a highly expressed sense transgene into a plant resulting in reduced expression of both the transgene and the endogenous gene (Depicker and van Montagu, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 9: 373-82 (1997)). The effect depends on sequence identity between transgene and endogenous gene. Targeted mutagenesis techniques, for example TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) and “delete-a-gene” using fast-neutron bombardment, may be used to knockout gene function in a plant (Henikoff, et al., Plant Physiol. 135: 630-6 (2004); Li et al., Plant J. 27: 235-242 (2001)). TILLING involves treating seeds or individual cells with a mutagen to cause point mutations that are then discovered in genes of interest using a sensitive method for single-nucleotide mutation detection. Detection of desired mutations (e.g. mutations resulting in the inactivation of the gene product of interest) may be accomplished, for example, by PCR methods. For example, oligonucleotide primers derived from the gene of interest may be prepared and PCR may be used to amplify regions of the gene of interest from plants in the mutagenized population. Amplified mutant genes may be annealed to wild-type genes to find mismatches between the mutant genes and wild-type genes. Detected differences may be traced back to the plants which had the mutant gene thereby revealing which mutagenized plants will have the desired expression (e.g. silencing of the gene of interest). These plants may then be selectively bred to produce a population having the desired expression. TILLING can provide an allelic series that includes missense and knockout mutations, which exhibit reduced expression of the targeted gene. TILLING is touted as a possible approach to gene knockout that does not involve introduction of transgenes, and therefore may be more acceptable to consumers. Fast-neutron bombardment induces mutations, i.e. deletions, in plant genomes that can also be detected using PCR in a manner similar to TILLING. Nucleic Acid Constructs In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a sequence that suppresses a transcription factor that regulates alkaloid biosynthesis is incorporated into a nucleic acid construct that is suitable for introducing into a plant or cell. Thus, such a nucleic acid construct can be used to suppress at least one of NbTF1, NbTF3 NbTF4, NbTF5, NbTF6 and NbTF7. and optionally at least one of A622, NBB1, PMT, QPT, and MPO in a plant or cell. In another aspect of the invention, a sequence that increases activity of transcription factor that regulates alkaloid biosynthesis is incorporated into a nucleic acid construct that is suitable for introducing into a plant or cell. Thus, such a nucleic acid construct can be used to overexpress NbTF1, NbTF3, NbTF4, NbTF5, NbTF6 and NbTF7, and optionally at least one of A622, NBB1, PMT, and QPT, and MPO in a plant or cell. Recombinant nucleic acid constructs may be made using standard techniques. For example, the DNA sequence for transcription may be obtained by treating a vector containing said sequence with restriction enzymes to cut out the appropriate segment. The DNA sequence for transcription may also be generated by annealing and ligating synthetic oligonucleotides or by using synthetic oligonucleotides in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to give suitable restriction sites at each end. The DNA sequence then is cloned into a vector containing suitable regulatory elements, such as upstream promoter and downstream terminator sequences. An important aspect of the present invention is the use of nucleic acid constructs wherein an a sequence encoding a transcription factor that regulates alkaloid biosynthesis is operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences, which drive expression of the transcription factor-encoding sequence in certain cell types, organs, or tissues without unduly affecting normal development or physiology. Promoters useful for expression of a nucleic acid sequence introduced into a cell to either decrease or increase expression of a transcription factor that regulates alkaloid biosynthesis may be constitutive promoters, such as the carnation etched ring virus (CERV), cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, or more particularly the double enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus promoter, comprising two CaMV 35S promoters in tandem (referred to as a “Double 35S” promoter). Tissue-specific, tissue-preferred, cell type-specific, and inducible promoters may be desirable under certain circumstances. For example, a tissue-specific promoter allows for overexpression in certain tissues without affecting expression in other tissues. Preferred promoters include promoters which are active in root tissues, such as the tobacco RB7promoter (Hsu et al., Pestic. Sci. 44: 9-19 (1995); U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,252), maize promoter CRWAQ81 (US published patent application 20050097633); the Arabidopsis ARSK1 promoter (Hwang and Goodman, Plant J. 8:37-43 (1995)), the maize MR7 promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,848), the maize ZRP2 promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,363), the maize MTL promoter (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,466,785 and 6,018,099) the maize MRS1, MRS2, MRS3, and MRS4 promoters (U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050010974), an Arabidopsis cryptic promoter (U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030106105) and promoters that are activated under conditions that result in elevated expression of enzymes involved in nicotine biosynthesis such as the tobacco RD2 promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,876), PMT promoters (Shoji et al., Plant Cell Physiol. 41: 831-39 (2000); WO 2002/038588) or an A622 promoter (Shoji, et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 50: 427-40 (2002)). The vectors of the invention may also contain termination sequences, which are positioned downstream of the nucleic acid molecules of the invention, such that transcription of mRNA is terminated, and polyA sequences added. Exemplary of such terminators include Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase terminator (Tnos), Agrobacterium tumefaciens mannopine synthase terminator (Tmas) and the CaMV 35S terminator (T35S). Particularly preferred termination regions for use according to the invention include the pea ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit termination region (TrbcS) or the Tnos termination region. The expression vector also may contain enhancers, start codons, splicing signal sequences, and targeting sequences. Expression vectors of the invention may also contain a selection marker by which transformed cells can be identified in culture. The marker may be associated with the heterologous nucleic acid molecule, i.e., the gene operably linked to a promoter. As used herein, the term “marker” refers to a gene encoding a trait or a phenotype that permits the selection of, or the screening for, a plant or cell containing the marker. In plants, for example, the marker gene will encode antibiotic or herbicide resistance. This allows for selection of transformed cells from among cells that are not transformed or transfected. Examples of suitable selectable markers include adenosine deaminase, dihydrofolate reductase, hygromycin-B-phosphotransferase, thymidine kinase, xanthine-guanine phospho-ribosyltransferase, glyphosate and glufosinate resistance, and amino-glycoside 3′-O-phosphotransferase (kanamycin, neomycin and G418 resistance). These markers may include resistance to G418, hygromycin, bleomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin. The construct may also contain the selectable marker gene bar that confers resistance to herbicidal phosphinothricin analogs like ammonium gluphosinate. Thompson et al, EMBO J. 9: 2519-23 (1987). Other suitable selection markers are known as well. Visible markers such as green florescent protein (GFP) may be used. Methods for identifying or selecting transformed plants based on the control of cell division have also been described. See WO 2000/052168 and WO 2001/059086. Replication sequences, of bacterial or viral origin, may also be included to allow the vector to be cloned in a bacterial or phage host. Preferably, a broad host range prokaryotic origin of replication is used. A selectable marker for bacteria may be included to allow selection of bacterial cells bearing the desired construct. Suitable prokaryotic selectable markers also include resistance to antibiotics such as kanamycin or tetracycline. Other nucleic acid sequences encoding additional functions may also be present in the vector, as is known in the art. For instance, when Agrobacterium is the host, T-DNA sequences may be included to facilitate the subsequent transfer to and incorporation into plant chromosomes. Such gene constructs may suitably be screened for activity by transformation into a host plant via Agrobacterium and screening for modified alkaloid levels. Suitably, the nucleotide sequences for the genes may be extracted from the Genbank™ nucleotide database and searched for restriction enzymes that do not cut. These restriction sites may be added to the genes by conventional methods such as incorporating these sites in PCR primers or by sub-cloning. Preferably, constructs are comprised within a vector, most suitably an expression vector adapted for expression in an appropriate host (plant) cell. It will be appreciated that any vector which is capable of producing a plant comprising the introduced DNA sequence will be sufficient. Suitable vectors are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in general technical references such as Pouwels et al, Cloning Vectors. A Laboratory Manual, Elsevier, Amsterdam (1986). Particularly suitable vectors include the Ti plasmid vectors. Host Plants and Cells The present invention comprehends the genetic manipulation of a plant or cell via introducing a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a transcription factor that regulates alkaloid biosynthesis. Accordingly, the present invention provides methodology and constructs for reducing or increasing alkaloid synthesis in a plant. Additionally, the invention provides methods for producing alkaloids and related compounds in a plant cell. A. Plants The class of plants which can be used in the present invention is generally as broad as the class of alkaloid-producing higher plants amenable to genetic engineering techniques, including both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, as well as gymnosperms. A preferred alkaloid-producing plant includes a nicotinic alkaloid-producing plant of the Nicotiana, Duboisia, Solanum, Anthocercis, and Salpiglossis genera in the Solanaceae or the Eclipta and Zinnia genera in the Compositae. As known in the art, there are a number of ways by which genes and gene constructs can be introduced into plants, and a combination of plant transformation and tissue culture techniques have been successfully integrated into effective strategies for creating transgenic crop plants. These methods, which can be used in the present invention, have been described elsewhere (Potrykus, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 42: 205-225 (1991); Vasil, Plant Mol. Biol. 5: 925-937 (1994); Walden and Wingender, Trends Biotechnol. 13: 324-331 (1995); Songstad, et al., Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture 40:1-15 (1995)), and are well known to persons skilled in the art. For example, one skilled in the art will certainly be aware that, in addition to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis by vacuum infiltration (Bechtold et al., C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. III Sci. Vie, 316: 1194-1199 (1993)) or wound inoculation (Katavic et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 245: 363-370 (1994)), it is equally possible to transform other plant and crop species, using Agrobacterium Ti-plasmid-mediated transformation (e.g., hypocotyl (DeBlock et al., Plant Physiol. 91: 694-701 (1989)) or cotyledonary petiole (Moloney et al., Plant Cell Rep. 8: 238-242 (1989) wound infection), particle bombardment/biolistic methods (Sanford et al., J. Part. Sci. Technol. 5: 27-37 (1987); Nehra et al., Plant J. 5: 285-297 (1994); Becker et al., Plant J. 5: 299-307 (1994)) or polyethylene glycol-assisted protoplast transformation (Rhodes et al., Science 240: 204-207 (1988); Shimamoto et al., Nature 335: 274-276 (1989)) methods. Agrobacterium rhizogenes may be used to produce transgenic hairy roots cultures of plants, including tobacco, as described, for example, by Guillon et al., Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 9: 341-6 (2006). “Tobacco hairy roots” refers to tobacco roots that have T-DNA from an Ri plasmid of Agrobacterium rhizogenes integrated in the genome and grow in culture without supplementation of auxin and other phytohormones. Tobacco hairy roots produce nicotinic alkaloids as roots of a whole tobacco plant do. Additionally, plants may be transformed by Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium or Mesorhizobium transformation. (Broothaerts et al., Nature 433: 629-633 (2005)). After transformation of the plant cells or plant, those plant cells or plants into which the desired DNA has been incorporated may be selected by such methods as antibiotic resistance, herbicide resistance, tolerance to amino-acid analogues or using phenotypic markers. Various assays may be used to determine whether the plant cell shows a change in gene expression, for example, Northern blotting or quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Whole transgenic plants may be regenerated from the transformed cell by conventional methods. Such transgenic plants may be propagated and self pollinated to produce homozygous lines. Such plants produce seeds containing the genes for the introduced trait and can be grown to produce plants that will produce the selected phenotype. Modified alkaloid content, effected in accordance with the present invention, can be combined with other traits of interest, such as disease resistance, pest resistance, high yield or other traits. For example, a stable genetically engineered transformant that contains a suitable transgene that modifies alkaloid content may be employed to introgress a modified alkaloid content trait into a desirable commercially acceptable genetic background, thereby obtaining a cultivar or variety that combines a modified alkaloid level with said desirable background. For example, a genetically engineered tobacco plant with reduced nicotine may be employed to introgress the reduced nicotine trait into a tobacco cultivar with disease resistance trait, such as resistance to TMV, blank shank, or blue mold. Alternatively, cells of a modified alkaloid content plant of the present invention may be transformed with nucleic acid constructs conferring other traits of interest. B. Cells The invention contemplates genetically engineering a cell with a nucleic acid sequence encoding a transcription factor that regulates alkaloid biosynthesis. Illustrative cells include but are not limited to cells of plants such Nicotiana tabacum, Atropa belladonna, Hyoscyamus niger, Additionally, cells expressing alkaloid biosynthesis genes may be supplied with precursors to increase substrate availability for alkaloid synthesis. Cells may be supplied with analogs of precursors which may be incorporated into analogs of naturally occurring alkaloids. Constructs according to the invention may be introduced into any plant cell, using a suitable technique, such as Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, particle bombardment, electroporation, and polyethylene glycol fusion, or cationic lipid-mediated transfection. Such cells may be genetically engineered with a nucleic acid construct of the present invention without the use of a selectable or visible marker and transgenic organisms may be identified by detecting the presence of the introduced construct. The presence of a protein, polypeptide, or nucleic acid molecule in a particular cell can be measured to determine if, for example, a cell has been successfully transformed or transfected. For example, and as routine in the art, the presence of the introduced construct can be detected by PCR or other suitable methods for detecting a specific nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence. Additionally, genetically engineered cells may be identified by recognizing differences in the growth rate or a morphological feature of a transformed cell compared to the growth rate or a morphological feature of a non-transformed cell that is cultured under similar conditions. See WO 2004/076625. IV. Quantifying Alkaloid Content A. Reduced Alkaloids Pursuant to one aspect of the invention, genetically engineered plants and cells are characterized by reduced alkaloid content. A quantitative reduction in alkaloid levels can be assayed by several methods, as for example by quantification based on gas-liquid chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, radio-immunoassays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In the present invention, alkaloid levels were measured by HPLC analysis performed on a Waters 2695 separations module equipped with a Waters X-Terra RP18 5 μm 4.6×150 mm with precolumn at a column temperature of 60°. The isocratic elution system consisted of 80% A:20% B where solvent A consisted of 50 mM citrate, 10 mM octanesulfonic acid pH 3.0 (adjusted with triethylamine) containing 5% methanol and solvent B was methanol over 15 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Injection volume was 20 μl. Nicotine was detected at 261 nm via photodiode array detection. In describing a plant of the invention, the phrase “decreased alkaloid plant” or “reduced alkaloid plant” encompasses a plant that has a decrease in alkaloid content to a level less than 50%, and preferably less than 10%, 5%, or 1% of the alkaloid content of a control plant of the same species or variety. B. Increased Alkaloids In one aspect of the invention, genetically engineered plants are characterized by increased alkaloid content. Similarly, genetically engineered cells are characterized by increased alkaloid production. In describing a plant of the invention, the phrase “increased alkaloid plant” encompasses a genetically engineered plant that has an increase in alkaloid content greater than 10%, and preferably greater than 50%, 100%, or 200% of the alkaloid content of a control plant of the same species or variety. A successfully genetically engineered cell is characterized by increased alkaloid synthesis. For example, an inventive genetically engineered cell may produce more nicotine compared to a control cell. A quantitative increase in nicotinic alkaloid levels can be assayed by several methods, as for example by quantification based on gas-liquid chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, radio-immunoassays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In the present invention, alkaloid levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with a reversed phase column and a photodiode array detector as described above. Products The polynucleotide sequences that encode transcription factors that regulate alkaloid biosynthesis may be used for production of plants with altered alkaloid levels. Such plants may have useful properties, such as increased pest resistance in the case of increased-alkaloid plants, or reduced toxicity and increased palatability in the case of decreased-alkaloid plants. Plants of the present invention may be useful in the production of products derived from harvested portions of the plants. For example, decreased-alkaloid tobacco plants may be useful in the production of reduced-nicotine cigarettes for smoking cessation. Increased-alkaloid tobacco plants may be useful in the production of modified risk tobacco products. Additionally, plants and cells of the present invention may be useful in the production of alkaloids or alkaloid analogs including nicotine analogs, which may be used as therapeutics, insecticides, or synthetic intermediates. To this end, large-scale or commercial quantities of alkaloids and related compounds can be produced by a variety of methods, including extracting compounds from genetically engineered plant, cell, or culture system, including but not limited to hairy root cultures, suspension cultures, callus cultures, and shoot cultures. In the following examples, functional genomics was used to elucidate six genes, NbTF1, NbTF2, NbTF4, NbTF5, NbTF6 and NbTF7, that encode transcription factors, that regulate alkaloid accumulation in Nicotiana benthamiana. Suppression of each of these six genes in N. benthamiana by virus-Induced gene silencing resulted in alteration of alkaloid levels. In four cases alkaloid levels were reduced, and in two cases alkaloid levels were increased. cDNA clones of NbTF1, NbTF2, NbTF4, NbTF5, NbTF6 and NbTF7 were obtained. Constructs for overexpression of the transcription factors were made and introduced into plant cells. The data from the present experiments indicate that the transcription factor nucleic acid sequences are useful in the production of plants and plants cells with altered alkaloid levels, in particular altered levels of nicotinic alkaloids. These examples are meant to be illustrative only and are not to be read as limiting the present invention. Example 1 Construction of Subtractive cDNA Libraries from Nicotiana benthamiana Roots, EST Sequencing and Selection of Transcription Factor Genes Nicotine biosynthesis occurs in the roots of Nicotiana species (Dawson, Science 94: 396-397 (1941)) and is induced by insect damage, wounding and the application of jasmonates (Winz and Baldwin, Plant Physiol. 125: 2189-2202 (2001)). In order to identify genes encoding transcription factors that control nicotine biosynthesis, we combined expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing of methyljasmonate (MeJa)-induced roots of Nicotiana benthamiana with functional analysis using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) (Liu and Page, Plant Methods 4: 5 (2008)). Hydroponic Cultivation of Nicotiana benthamiana Nicotiana benthamiana Domin (Solanaceae) seedlings were grown hydroponically in 0.25× Hoagland's solution supplemented with iron chelate solution and oxygenated using an aquarium bubbler. Roots from three-week old plants were sampled before (t=0) and at 1, 4, and 7 hours after addition of MeJa to a final concentration of 11 μM. Total RNA was isolated from 450 mg each of untreated leaves, untreated roots, and a combined MeJa-treated root sample composed of 150 mg roots each from the 1, 4 and 7 hour time points using a RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen). We constructed three separate subtractive cDNA libraries: NBREL2, with mRNA pooled from MeJa-treated roots as tester and untreated root mRNA as driver; NBLEL3, with mRNA pooled from MeJa-treated roots as tester and leaf mRNA as driver; and NBREL4, with mRNA pooled from MeJa-treated roots as both tester and driver. I.A.1.1 Construction of Subtracted VIGS-cDNA Libraries A PCR-select subtractive cDNA library kit (Clontech) was used for cDNA synthesis with some modifications. Briefly, about 250 ng of total RNA was mixed with 300 μl of Oligo (dT)25 Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech) in binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 M LiCl, 2 mM EDTA). After 10 min incubation, the beads were washed three times with washing buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.15M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA), followed by washing twice with first strand buffer. The washed beads containing mRNA were resuspended in 40 μl of cDNA synthesis cocktail (8 μl 5× first strand buffer, 4 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 24 μl RNase-free water and 4 μl (8U) AMV reverse transcriptase) and incubated at 42° C. for 1.5 hours. The second strand synthesis was completed by addition of 120 μl of second strand synthesis cocktail (32 μl of 5× second strand buffer, 3.2 μl of 10 mM dNTPs, 8 μl of 20× enzyme cocktail and 77 μl RNase free water) and incubation at 16° C. for 2 hours, followed by addition of 4 μl (12U) T4 DNA polymerase and further incubation for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl 0.5 M EDTA. The beads were magnetically separated, the supernatant removed and the beads resuspended in 500 μl of wash buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS and 10 μg/ml glycogen) and heated at 75° C. for 15 min. The beads were then washed three times with wash buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl and 200 μg/ml BSA), followed by two more washes with RsaI buffer. The beads were resuspended in 84 μl H2O, 10 μl 10× RsaI buffer, 3 μl (30 U) RsaI, and incubated at 37° C. overnight. The free cDNA was isolated by magnetic separation of the beads and was used for adapter ligation, hybridizations and primary PCR as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Secondary PCR was performed using primers 5′-CGGGATCCTCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT-3′ (BamH1 site underlined) (SEQ ID NO: 18) and 5′-CGGAATTCAGCGTGGTCGCGGCCGAGGT-3′ (EcoR1 site underlined) (SEQ ID NO: 19). The PCR-select amplified cDNA fragments (700 ng) were digested with EcoRI and BamHI, followed by ligation into a similarly digested TRV-RNA2 vector, pYL156 (Liu et al., Plant Journal 30: 415-429 (2002)). The ligation mixture was electroporated into DH10B E. coli competent cells to give primary libraries. These was amplified on agar plates, plasmid DNA isolated and used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 via electroporation. The ligation efficiency as determined by colony PCR was 98%. IA.1.2 EST Sequencing of Subtracted VIGS-cDNA Library and Identification of Transcription Factor Candidates To amplify cDNA inserts for sequencing, PCR was performed using vector primers 5′-GTTACTCAAGGAAGCACGATGAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 20) and 5′-CAGTCGAGAATGTCAATCTCGTAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 21) and randomly selected A. tumefaciens colonies as template. The resulting PCR products were sequenced directly using BigDye terminators and the primer 5′-GTTACTCAAGGAAGCACGATGAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 20). 2016 ESTs were sequenced from NBREL2, and 1920 each from NBLEL3 and NBREL4. After removal of poor quality sequences, and combining of the three datasets, we obtained 3480 unique transcripts consisting of 606 contigs and 2874 singletons. The total VIGS-EST dataset was annotated via BLASTX comparison to the NCBI non-redundant database. Using a combination of keyword searching on blastx annotations and blast analysis with transcription factors sequences, we identified 108 putative unique transcripts encoding transcription factors. These consisted of 24 contigs and 84 singletons. Example 2 Screening of Transcription Factors for the Effect on Leaf Nicotine Accumulation Using VIGS We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) (Baulcombe, Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2: 109-113 (1999); Lu et al., Methods 30: 296-303 (2003)) to test the effect of silencing the candidate transcription factor genes on nicotine biosynthesis. I.A.1.3 VIGS Silencing of Transcription Factors VIGS constructs representing different transcription factors were tested for their ability to alter leaf nicotine levels both before and after application of MeJa to leaves. N. benthamiana plants were grown in soil in a controlled environment chamber with 16 hour/23° days and 8 hour/20° nights under approximately 100 mmol/m2/s light intensity. Cultures of A. tumefaciens C58 containing the TRV-RNA1 plasmid or TRV-RNA2 constructs (pYL156) (both described in Liu et al., Plant Journal 30: 415-429 (2002) were grown overnight at 28° C. After centrifugation, the bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in infiltration buffer containing 1 mM MES (pH 5), 10 mM MgCl2 and 100 μM acetosyringone to OD600=1 and allowed to stand at room temperature for 3-6 hours before infiltration. Suspensions of TRV-RNA1 and pYL279 constructs were mixed 1:1 and infiltrated into the underside of the upper leaves of 3-4 week old plants using a 1 ml syringe. Negative control plants were infiltrated with buffer only or a TRV-RNA2 construct containing a non-functional fragment of green fluorescent protein (TRV-GFP). Plants were grown for 3 weeks before leaf nicotine levels in infected N. benthamiana plants were measured using ion-pair HPLC before and five days after application of MeJa (0.1% in a 0.1% Tween-20 solution sprayed on all leaf surfaces). A known gene encoding a nicotine biosynthetic enzyme (putrescine N-methyltransferase, PMT) was used as a positive control for VIGS knockdown of nicotine biosynthesis. I.A.1.4 Nicotine Analysis by Ion Pair HPLC Young (˜3-5 cm) N. benthamiana leaves were sampled by excising one half of a leaf from each plant. After determining fresh weight of the sample, 200 μl of zirconium beads and 300 μl of 50 mM citrate buffer pH 3:methanol (70:30) were added, the sample as homogenized with a Beadbeater followed by incubation in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. The resulting extract was incubated at 4° overnight before centrifugation and filtration (0.45 μm, Spin-X) to clarify the extract. Ion-pair HPLC analysis was performed on a Waters 2695 separations module equipped with a Waters X-Terra RP18 5 μm 4.6×150 mm with precolumn at a column temperature of 60°. The isocratic elution system consisted of 80% A:20% B where solvent A consisted of 50 mM citrate, 10 mM octanesulfonic acid pH 3.0 (adjusted with triethylamine) containing 5% methanol and solvent B was methanol over 15 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Injection volume was 20 μl. Nicotine was detected at 261 nm via photodiode array detection. Quantification was performed using peak area by comparison to a standard curve (r2 0.999) derived from injection of solutions of authentic nicotine ranging in concentration from 1040 μg/ml to 10.4 μg/ml. Of the 108 transcription factors tested, VIGS of four led to reduced nicotine levels (NbTF1, NbTF4, NbTF5, NbTF6) and VIGS of two gave increased constitutive nicotine levels (NbTF7) or increased levels after MeJa application (NbTF3) (FIG. 1). Buffer and TRV-GFP control plants had similar nicotine levels, indicating that TRV infection had little influence on nicotine biosynthesis. As expected, the silencing of putrescine N-methyltransferase, a key enzyme in the nicotine pathway, led to substantial reductions in leaf nicotine. Example 2 Cloning of Full-Length cDNAs for Transcription Factors Affecting Leaf Nicotine Accumulation IA.1.5 Full-Length cDNAs were Obtained Using Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) PCR. I.A.1.6 NbTF1 IA.1.7 5′ and 3′ RACE PCR was used to obtain the full-length cDNA sequence of NbTF1.

I.A.1.8 NbTF3 I.A.1.9 The NbTF3 sequence identified from the EST sequencing was a 295 bp singleton that was extended via genome walking (Genome Walker kit, Clontech), to yield a 626 bp fragment. Despite the use of 5′ and 3′ RACE PCR and further application of genome walking, we did not obtain additional sequence information for NbTF3. The partial sequence of the NbTF3 gene from N. benthamiana is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4 I.A.1.10 NbTF4 IA.1.11 Genome walking was used to obtain the full-length cDNA sequence of NbTF4. The open reading frame (ORF) of NbTF4 is 759 bp. The sequence of the NbTF4 gene is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 5. The NBTF4 ORF is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6. The predicted amino acid sequence of the N. benthamiana NbTF4 is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7. I.A.1.12 NbTF5 IA.1.13 Blast searching of a conventional N. benthamiana root cDNA library was used to obtain the full-length cDNA clone of NbTF5. The full-length NbTF5 gene was 2401 bp in length encoding an open reading frame (ORF) of 1971 bp. The sequence of the NbTF5 gene from N. benthamiana is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 8. The NbTF5 ORF sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9. The predicted amino acid sequence of the N. benthamiana NbTF5 is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 10. I.A.1.14 NbTF6 IA.1.15 5′ and 3′ RACE PCR was used to obtain the full-length sequence of NbTF6. The full-length NbTF6 gene was 958 bp in length encoding an open reading frame (ORF) of 669 bp. The sequence of the NbTF6 gene from N. benthamiana is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 11. The NbTF6 ORF is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 12. The predicted amino acid sequence of the N. benthamiana NbTF6 is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 13. I.A.1.16 NbTF7 I.A.1.17 5′ and 3′ RACE PCR and GenomeWalking were used to obtain the full-length sequence of NbTF7.

The NbTF7 ORF sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 15. The predicted amino acid sequence of the N. benthamiana NbTF7 is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 16 The six transcription factors represented several different classes of transcription factors. These classifications, and the DNA sequence of the associated cis-element to which they bind, are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Classification of N. benthamiana transcription factors Associated Name Transcription Factor Class cis-element NbTF1 Myc, basic helix-loop-helix G-box CACGTG (bHLH) NbTF3 Myc, basic helix-loop-helix G-box CACGTG (bHLH) NbTF4 Homeodomain leucine zipper NbTF5 Myc, basic helix-loop-helix G-box CACGTG (bHLH) NbTF6 AP2, ethylene-response GCC-box factor AGCCGCC NbTF7 B3 domain, auxin response CACCTG factor Example 3 Modifying Alkaloid Biosynthesis in Transgenic Plants We used stable transformation of N. benthamiana to introduce the six transcription factor genes as both sense overexpression constructs (for NbTF1, NbTF4, NbTF5, NbTF6, NbTF7) and RNA interference (RNAi) constructs (for all six transcription factors). Open reading frames (for overexpression) and cDNA fragments (for RNAi) were amplified using PCR and cloned into the Gateway® entry vector pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen) or pENTR-D/TOPO (Invitrogen). Overexpression constructs were recombined into the Gateway® plant transformation vector pK7WG2 using LR clonase (Invitrogen). Similarly, RNAi constructs were recombined into the Gateway® RNAi vector pK7GW1WG2(I). All cloning procedures were performed in E. coli and final, sequence confirmed constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58. Plants were transformed using leaf disc methods adapted from Draper et al. (In: Plant Genetic Transformation and Gene Expression: A Laboratory Manual, pp. 97-144. Draper, J., Scott, R., et al. (eds.), Blackwell Scientific Publications (1988)). Briefly leaf discs excised from mature N. benthamiana plants were surface sterilized, incubated in Agrobacterium culture containing the construct of interest and then placed on MS agar plates for two to four days. The leaf disks are transferred to shoot regeneration agar media plus 300 μg/ml timentin and 100 μg/ml kanamycin. After four and six weeks shoots that had formed on callus tissue were excised and transferred to MS+timentin+kanamycin agar plates. After roots had developed, plantlets were transferred to soil to form T0 plants. Genomic DNA was isolated from each T0 plant and the presence or absence of transgenes was determined using PCR. Primers were designed to anneal to transformation vector and the transcription factor construct. T0 plants shown to be transgenic by PCR were analyzed using ion-pair HPLC to determine leaf nicotine levels. Nicotine was measured in samples containing three leaf discs (˜50 mg FW) and converted to a fresh weight basis. Wild-types varied between batches of regenerated plants due to differences in growing conditions. Silencing NbTF1 via RNAi constructs led to reduction of leaf nicotine in several of the transgenic lines as compared to both sense overexpression and wild-type control plants (FIG. 2). Sense overexpression of NbTF1 lead to an increase in leaf nicotine levels in line NbTF1 overexpression 6. Overexpression of NbTF4 led to an increase in leaf nicotine compared to wild-type plants, while NbTF4 silencing via RNAi gave reduced levels (FIG. 3). Overexpression of NbTF5 led to large increases in leaf nicotine levels while RNAi silencing of this gene resulted in an almost complete block in nicotine accumulation (FIG. 4). Transformation of plants with inverted repeats of segments of NbTF3, NbTF6 or NbTF7 in the plasmid pK7GW1WG2(I) did not result in lines with phenotypes similar to those seen in plants with VIGS of the same gene. This may indicate VIGS was more effective in silencing expression in the cells in which nicotine synthesis occurs. 1.
