Step 4: (E)-4-((tert-Butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-((2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino)-1-(2,4,5-trichloropyridin-3-yl)but-2-en-1-one
To a stirred solution of 4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-1-(2,4,5-trichloropyridin-3-yl)but-2-yn-1-one (7.41 g, 19.56 mmol) in DCM (185 ml), were added 2,6-dichloroaniline (3.49 g, 21.52 mmol) followed by AlCl3 (2.87 g, 21.52 mmol) in one portion at 0Â° C. and reaction mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. The progress of the reaction was monitored by LC-MS which showed complete consumption of the starting material. To the reaction mixture 2N NaOH (20 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. Reaction mixture was extracted with DCM and the combined organic layers were washed with brine dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude compound was purified by silica gel column chromatography (10-100% EtOAc in heptane) to afford the title compound (6.4 g, 61% yield).
