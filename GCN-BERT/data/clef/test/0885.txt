Step B: 3-(2,6-Difluorophenyl)-1-(4-methyphenyl)-1H-indazole-6-carboxylic acid
Methyl 3-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-indazole-6-carboxylate (101.2 mg, 0.267 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (1.30 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (1.90 mL). 1M sodium hydroxide (1.60 mL, 0.267 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to 50 Â°C and allowed to stir for 1.5 h. Reaction stopped, cooled to room temperature, quenched by addition of 1M hydrochloric acid (ca 1.60 mL) till pH<3, and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The title compound (199.5 mg, 0.265 mmol, 99 % yield, with 6 equivalents of sodium chloride) was recovered as a white solid.
