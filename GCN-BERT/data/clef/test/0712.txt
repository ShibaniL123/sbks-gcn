The invention relates to aqueous adjuvant compositions comprising alkylglucamides, to their use for producing aqueous pesticide compositions, and to aqueous pesticide compositions comprising alkylglucamides. Pesticides (primarily fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides) are chemical substances produced synthetically or of natural origin that penetrate plant cells, plant tissue, or parasitic organisms in or on the plant, causing their damage and/or destruction. The largest share of the pesticides is that of herbicides. Pesticides are used customarily in the form of liquid or solid concentrated preparations (formulations) in agriculture. These preparations make handling easier for the user or ensure greater activity on the part of the active ingredient. The formulations are customarily diluted with water before use and then delivered by spray application. Water-soluble concentrates (Soluble Liquids, abbreviated SL) are one particularly important form of pesticide preparations. They play a large part particularly for herbicides, with the pesticides often being used as water-soluble salts which are converted into their alkali metal salts or ammonium salts by neutralization of the acid form of the herbicides with suitable bases. A particularly important part is played by the water-soluble salts of herbicides, such as, for example, of glyphosate, of glufosinate, or of the auxin herbicides such as 2,4-D or dicamba. They are used preferably as the alkali metal salt or in the form of various ammonium salts, or as a mixture of these salts, usually as aqueous formulations. A general problem with the use of pesticides is that only a fraction of the active ingredient develops the desired activity. The greater part is often lost without being utilized, with the active ingredient failing to reach the leaves or roots of the plant when the spray mixture is delivered, and instead seeping unutilized into the soil, being washed off by rain, or simply not being properly taken up by the plant. This environmental and economic disadvantage can be reduced by addition of auxiliaries, identified in the context of the present patent application as “adjuvants”, to pesticide formulations. These auxiliaries may, for example, reduce spray drift, improve wetting of the plant, or ensure that the active ingredient adheres to the plant surface for a longer time and/or is taken up more effectively. Particularly in the case of water-soluble pesticides, such as in the case of glyphosate, for example, the nature and also the amount of the adjuvants used have a critical influence on the activity of the formulation. By far the most commonly used adjuvants in aqueous herbicide formulations are fatty amine ethoxylates, principally tallow fatty amine ethoxylates. On account of their toxic and ecotoxicological properties, however, such as the severe eye irritation or the toxicity toward aquatic organisms, these products are classed as objectionable and are increasingly being replaced by adjuvants having a better toxicological and ecotoxicological profile. Adjuvants which are employed in aqueous pesticide formulations are customarily in liquid form, i.e., as water-miscible solutions, in order to simplify production of the pesticide formulation. The adjuvant solutions may comprise water and/or water-miscible solvents which together with the pesticide produce a homogeneous and storage-stable aqueous formulation. Water is used as solvent if possible, being preferred for reasons not only of cost but also of the environment. Cosolvents may be used, capable of improving the solubility or the stability. The use of sugar-based surfactants, such as alkyl-N-methylglucosamides, in cleaning products and cosmetic products, for example, is described in the literature (F. W. Lichtenthaler, “Carbohydrates as Organic Raw Materials” in Ullmann's Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH Verlag, 2010). WO 96/16540 describes pesticide compositions which long-chain alkylamides that carry on the amide nitrogen a polyhydroxycarbonyl substituent having at least three hydroxyl groups. Described in the examples are emulsifiable concentrates, water-dispersible powders, and granules of dodecyl-N-methylglucamide, dodecyltetradecyl-N-methylglucamide, and cetylstearyl-N-methylglucamide. The requirements relating to adjuvants in aqueous pesticide compositions have grown continually over the years. Besides high biological activity and unobjectionability, from the standpoint both of the user and of the environment, increasingly more advantageous performance properties are being required. The adjuvants are to permit very high loading of the formulation with the active ingredient, and are to be compatible as far as possible with different active ingredients. The formulations must be storage-stable and must have a very low viscosity, in order to ensure greater ease of handling, and also must facilitate complete or near-complete emptying of the containers. Further requirements are for effective miscibility and rapid dissolution capacity, including and particularly in cold water, when the spray mixture is being prepared. The object, accordingly, was that of providing new aqueous adjuvant compositions which are highly active, which are distinguished by a very advantageous toxicological and environmental profile, and which have properties advantageous from a performance standpoint. The object is surprisingly achieved by new adjuvant compositions comprising a) one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I) in which R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group having 5 to 9 carbon atoms, R2 is an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, b) water c) optionally a cosolvent. In the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I), the radical R1 is preferably a linear or branched alkyl group having 7 to 9 carbon atoms. The radical R2 is preferably a methyl group. More preferably the adjuvant compositions of the invention comprise a mixture of octyl-N-methylglucamide (R1=C7 alkyl, R2=methyl) and decyl-N-methylglucamide (R1=C9 alkyl, R2=methyl). The fraction of octyl-N-methylglucamide in this mixture is 10 to 90 wt %, preferably 20 to 80 wt %, and more preferably 30 to 70 wt %, based on the total amount of alkylglucamides present in said mixture. The fraction of decyl-N-methylglucamide in this mixture is 10 to 90 wt %, preferably 20 to 80 wt %, and more preferably 30 to 70 wt %, based on the total amount of alkylglucamides present in this mixture. The pentahydroxyhexyl radical in the alkylglucamides of the formula (I) possesses different chiral centers, meaning that in each case there are a plurality of possible stereoisomers. The alkylglucamides of the formula (I) are customarily prepared from naturally occurring sugars, such as D-glucose, although in principle it is possible to use other natural or synthetic hexoses or other C6 building blocks as well, and so different stereoisomers of the formula (I) may result. The cosolvent c) included optionally may either be present as a secondary component from the alkylglucamide preparation procedure, or may have been added subsequently to the adjuvant composition. The cosolvent may comprise a single solvent or a mixture of two or more solvents. Suitable for this purpose are all polar solvents which are compatible with the aqueous pesticide composition and which form a homogeneous phase. Examples of suitable cosolvents are monohydric alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanols, butanols, benzyl alcohol, or polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or glycerol, or polyglycols such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or mixed polyalkylene glycols (PAGs). Other suitable solvents are ethers such as, for example, propylene glycol monomethyl or dimethyl ether, dipropylene glycol monomethyl or dimethyl ether, amides such as N-methyl- or N-ethylpyrrolidone, for example, N, N-dimethyllactamide, N,N-dimethylcaprylamide, or N,N-dimethyldecanamide. Particularly suitable cosolvents are mono or polyhydric alcohols, and especially suitable are dihydric or trihydric alcohols such as propylene glycol, glycerol, or polyethylene, polypropylene and/or mixed polyalkylene glycols (PAGs). The fraction of the cosolvent in the composition is customarily 10 to 250 g/l, preferably 20 to 200 g/l, and more preferably 30 to 150 g/l. The cosolvent may additionally contribute toward stabilizing the adjuvant compositions, by, for example, raising the low-temperature stability or heat stability, or positively influencing other performance properties such as the viscosity. The alkylglucamides of the formula (I) are based preferably on renewable raw materials and are notable for an advantageous toxicological and environmental profile. They possess high solubility in water. The aqueous adjuvant compositions comprise preferably 10 to 90 wt %, more preferably 20 to 80 wt %, and especially preferably 30 to 70 wt % of the one or more alkylglucamides of component a). The aqueous adjuvant compositions of the alkylglucamides of the formula (I) are suitable as adjuvants in aqueous pesticide compositions for improving the biological activity of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, acaricides, bactericides, molluscids, nematicides, and rodenticides. Another subject of the invention is therefore the use of the aqueous adjuvant compositions for boosting the biological activity of pesticides, particularly of herbicides. The aqueous adjuvant compositions are outstandingly suitable for producing storage-stable aqueous pesticide compositions which possess advantageous properties. Another subject of the invention is therefore the use of the compositions of alkylglucamides for producing aqueous pesticide compositions. Customary methods for producing such pesticide compositions are known to the skilled person. Also a further subject of the invention, moreover, are aqueous pesticide compositions comprising a) one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I) in which R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group having 5 to 9 carbon atoms, R2 is an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, b) water c) optionally a cosolvent, d) one or more water-soluble pesticides. Water-soluble pesticides for the purposes of the invention are to be understood as meaning pesticides which at room temperature (25° C.) have a solubility of more 50 g/l and preferably more than 100 g/l in water. Preferred water-soluble pesticides are the water-soluble herbicides, among which preference is given in turn to the water-soluble salts of acifluorfen, aminopyralid, amitrole, asulam, benazolin, bentazone, bialaphos, bispyribac, bromacil, bromoxynil, bicyclopyron, chloramben, clopyralid, 2,4-D, 2,4-DB, dicamba, dichlorprop, difenzoquat, diquat, endothal, fenoxaprop, flamprop, flumiclorac, fluoroglycofen, fomesafen, fosamine, glufosinate, glyphosate, imizameth, imazamethabenz, imazomox, imazapic, imazapyr, imazaquin, imazethapyr, MCPA, MCPB, mecoprop, octanoic acid, paraquat, pelargonic acid, picloram, quizalofop, 2,3,6-TBA, and triclopyr. The precise chemical composition and structure of all of these compounds are known and can be looked up on the Internet at: http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides/index_cn_frame.html Particularly preferred are the water-soluble salts of 2,4-D, bentazone, dicamba, fomesafen, glyphosate, glufosinate, MCPA, and paraquat. Exceptionally preferred are the water-soluble salts of glyphosate. Preference among the water-soluble salts is given in particular to the alkali metal salts and ammonium salts, and of these in turn to the potassium, ammonium, dimethylammonium, isopropylammonium, and (2-hydroxyethyl)trimethylammonium salts. The water-soluble pesticides of component d) may also comprise a combination of two or more pesticides. Such combinations are important especially when the aim, for example, is to broaden the activity spectrum of the pesticide composition or more effectively to prevent resistances toward particular pesticides. Combining two or more water-soluble pesticides in one formulation, however, is a difficult enterprise. This is because the active ingredients are customarily not compatible with one another, and the aqueous mixtures are therefore not phase-stable. Very surprisingly, however, the alkylglucamides of the formula (I) are suitable for stabilizing such fundamentally incompatible compositions, a fact which was hitherto unknown. In a further embodiment of the invention, therefore, the pesticide compositions of the invention comprise at least two water-soluble pesticides of component d). With preference the at least two water-soluble pesticides are selected from glyphosate, glufosinate, 2,4-D, dicamba, and fomesafen. Particularly preferred compositions are those where the water-soluble pesticides of component d) comprise the combinations of the two herbicides glyphosate and 2,4-D, glyphosate and dicamba, glyphosate and fomesafen, glyfosate and glufosinate, 2,4-D and dicamba, glufosinate and 2,4-D, and glufosinate and dicamba. The preparation of the alkylglucamides of the formula (I) has been well described before and is known to the skilled person. It is accomplished, for example, by condensing carboxylic esters with a secondary N-alkylglucamine, which in its turn may be prepared by reductive amination from a sugar such as D-glucose. The alkylglucamides of the formula (I) described above can be used to produce pesticide compositions of the invention, especially aqueous herbicide formulations, having excellent performance properties. In the formulation of aqueous pesticide compositions, a concern is to load the composition with as high a concentration of active ingredient as possible. Doing so reduces costs of packaging, transport, storage, and disposal. An adjuvant composition ought therefore to be capable of permitting stable, highly loaded pesticide compositions, known as “high-load” formulations. This is accomplished surprisingly well with the alkylglucamides of the formula (I). In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the amount of the one or more water-soluble pesticides of component d) in the compositions of the invention is more than 100 g/l, preferably more than 200 g/l, and more preferably more than 300 g/l. These quantity figures are based on the total weight of the pesticide composition of the invention, and on the amount of free acid, or “acid equivalent” (a.e.) in the case of pesticides used in the form of their water-soluble salts (such as, customarily, glyphosate or 2,4-D, for example). In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the amount of the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I) in the pesticide compositions of the invention is 20 to 250 g/l, preferably 40 to 200 g/l, and more preferably 50 to 150 g/l. These quantity figures are based on the total amount of the pesticide composition of the invention. The alkylglucamides of the formula (I) are used customarily in the form of solutions. For clarification here it is noted that the quantity figures stated above are based in this case on the active content of the alkylglucamides of the formula (I) in the solution. A particularly important criterion for the storage stability of aqueous pesticide compositions such as glyphosate formulations and 2,4-D formulations, for example is the phase stability. A composition is held to be sufficiently phase-stable when it remains homogeneous over a wide temperature range and when there is no formation of two or more separate phases or of precipitates (formation of a further solid phase). Phase stability—both at elevated temperature, as may occur, for example, in the case of storage in the sun or in hot countries, and at low temperature, such as in winter or in cold climatic regions, for example—is the critical prerequisite for a storage-stable formulation. The pesticide compositions of the invention are notable in that they are phase-stable even at a temperature of preferably greater than 55° C., more preferably of greater than 70° C., and especially preferably of greater than 80° C. Furthermore, the pesticide compositions of the invention are notable for the fact that they are phase-stable even at a temperature of preferably less than 10° C., more preferably of less than 0° C., and especially preferably of less than −10° C. The pH of the pesticide compositions is situated customarily in the range from 3.5 to 8.0, preferably at 4.0 to 7.0, and more preferably at 4.5 to 6.5 (measured in the form of a 1 wt % aqueous dilution). The pH is determined primarily by the pH values of the solutions of the aqueous pesticides, present in the form of salts of weak acids. By addition of acids or bases, the pH can be adjusted to a different value differing from the original pH of the mixture. The high salt stability of the pesticide composition of the invention in an aqueous medium, even in the case of a high pesticide concentration and salt concentration, constitutes a great performance advantage. It also makes it possible for agrochemical salts such as fertilizers, for example, to be included in the composition. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, therefore, the pesticide compositions comprise one or more agrochemical salts, preferably ammonium salts. With particular preference the pesticide compositions comprise ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium thiocyanate and/or ammonium chloride. The pesticide compositions of the invention may comprise one or more auxiliaries further to the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I), and in that case these further auxiliaries may be, for example, preservatives, surfactants, defoamers, functional polymers, or additional adjuvants. Preservatives which can be used include organic acids and their esters, as for example ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, sorbate, benzoic acid, methyl and propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, propionates, phenol, as for example 2-phenylphenate, 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, formaldehyde, sulfurous acid, and salts thereof. The surfactants may generally be all nonionic, amphoteric, cationic, or anionic surfactants that are compatible with the composition. Examples of nonionic surfactants are ethoxylates and alkoxylates of relatively long-chain aliphastic or aromatic alcohols, fatty amine ethoxylates, relatively long-chain ether amine alkoxylates, (optionally ethoxylated) sorbitan esters, and alkylpolyglycosides. Suitable amphoteric surfactants include long-chain alkyldimethylbetaines or alkyldimethylamine oxides, or alkyldimethylamineamidopropylamine oxides. Suitable among the anionic surfactants, for example, are ether sulfates of ethoxylated fatty alcohols, reaction products of (optionally ethoxylated) long-chain alcohols with phosphoric acid derivatives. Suitability under “long-chain” is possessed by linear or branched hydrocarbon chains having at least 6 and not more than 22 carbon atoms. Suitable defoamers are fatty acid alkyl ester alkoxylates, organopolysiloxanes such as polydimethylsiloxanes and mixtures thereof with microfine, optionally silanized silica; perfluoroalkylphosphonates and -phosphinates, paraffins, waxes, and microcrystalline waxes, and mixtures thereof with silanized silica. Also advantageous are mixtures of different foam inhibitors, examples being those composed of silicone fluid, liquid paraffin and/or waxes. The functional polymers which may be present in the pesticide composition of the invention are high molecular mass compounds of synthetic or natural origin with a molar mass of greater than 10 000. The functional polymers may for example act as antidrift agents or may boost rain resistance. In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the pesticide compositions of the invention comprise one or more adjuvants further to the one or more alkylglucamides of component a), such adjuvants being those as may conventionally be used in aqueous pesticide compositions. These are, preferably, fatty amine ethoxylates, ether amine ethoxylates, alkylbetaines or amidoalkylbetaines, amine oxides or amidoalkylamine oxides, alkylpolyglycosides, or copolymers of glycerol, coconut fatty acid, and phthalic acid. These adjuvants are known from the literature as adjuvants in aqueous pesticide compositions and are described in WO2009/029561, for example. In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the pesticide compositions of the invention take the form of concentrated formulations which are diluted prior to use, in particular with water (examples being “ready-to-use”, “in-can”, or “built-in” formulations), and they comprise the one or more water-soluble pesticides of component d) in amounts of 5 to 80 wt %, preferably of 10 to 70 wt %, and more preferably of 20 to 60 wt %, and the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I) in amounts of 1 to 25 wt %, preferably of 2 to 20 wt %, and more preferably of 3 to 15 wt %. These quantity figures are based on the overall concentrated formulation, and on the amount of free acid, the “acid equivalent” (a.e.), in the case of pesticides which are used in the form of their water-soluble salts. The pesticide compositions of the invention are applied to the fields preferably in the form of spray mixtures. These spray mixtures are produced by diluting concentrated formulations with a defined quantity of water. In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the compositions of the invention are in the form of spray mixtures and comprise 0.001 to 10 wt %, preferably 0.02 to 3 wt %, and more preferably 0.025 to 2 wt % of the one or more water-soluble pesticides of component d) and 0.001 to 3 wt %, preferably 0.005 to 1 wt %, and more preferably 0.01 to 0.5 wt % of the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I). The stated quantity figures are based on the overall spray mixture, and on the amount of free acid, the “acid equivalent” (a.e.), in the case of pesticides which are used in the form of their water-soluble salts. The invention further relates to the use of the pesticide compositions of the invention for the checking and/or for the control of weeds, fungal diseases, or insect infestation. Preference is given to the use of the compositions of the invention for controlling and/or for checking weeds. These uses may preferably also take place by what is called a tank-mix method. In this scenario, then, the one or more water-soluble pesticides of component d) and the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I), and also the water, may also take the form of what is called a “tank-mix” preparation. In such a preparation, both the one or more water-soluble pesticides and the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I)—the latter optionally together with further adjuvants—are present separately from one another. Prior to application, generally a short time before, the two preparations are mixed with one another, producing a pesticide composition of the invention. WORKING EXAMPLES The invention is illustrated further below for the skilled person, using examples which, however, should not be considered in any way as confining the invention to the embodiments shown. Example 1 Production of an Inventive Aqueous Alkylglucamide Composition The alkylglucamide was prepared from a commercially available C8/C10 carboxylic acid methyl ester (C8 fraction 55 wt %, C10 fraction 45 wt %) by reaction with N-methylglucamine in propylene glycol as described in WO 92/06073. A mixture was formed which as well as 90 wt % of the alkylglucamide of the formula (I) R1=C8H17 and C10H21, R2=CH3, also contained 10 wt % of propylene glycol from the reaction mixture. 60 g of this mixture were dissolved in 40 g of water. This gave a stable aqueous solution of the C8/10-N-methylglucamide with a content of 54 wt % in water/propylene glycol. Example 2 Attempted Production of a Non-Inventive Aqueous Alkylglucamide Composition (Comparative Example) The alkylglucamide was prepared from a commercially available C12/C14 carboxylic acid methyl ester (C12 fraction 69 wt %, C14 fraction 25 wt %, other chain constituents 6 wt %) by reaction with N-methylglucamine in propylene glycol as described in WO 92/06073. This gave a mixture which as well as 90 wt % of the alkylglucamide of the formula (I) R1=C12H23 and C14H29, R2=CH3, also contained 10 wt % of propylene glycol from the reaction mixture. An attempt was made to dissolve this mixture in water, in analogy to example 1, but no stable solutions were obtained. The results are compiled in Table 1. Example 3 Attempted Production of a Non-Inventive Aqueous Alkylglucamide Composition (Comparative Example) The alkylglucamide was prepared from a commercially available C16/C18 carboxylic acid methyl ester (C16 fraction 38 wt %, C18 fraction 60 wt %, other chain constituents 2 wt %) by reaction with N-methylglucamine in propylene glycol as described in WO 92/06073. This gave a mixture which as well as 90 wt % of the alkylglucamide of the formula (I) R1=C16H33 and C18H37, R2=CH3, also contained 10 wt % of propylene glycol from the reaction mixture. An attempt was made to dissolve this mixture in water, in analogy to example 1, but no stable solutions were obtained. The results are compiled in Table 1. TABLE 1 Dissolution tests of the relatively long-chain alkylglucamides in water Example 2 Example 3 Fraction of C12/14 Fraction of C16/18 glucamide in glucamide in wt % wt % in water in water Observations 60 Not soluble 20 Soluble with heating, forms firm gel on cooling 10 Soluble with heating, forms firm gel on cooling 60 Not soluble 20 Soluble with heating, forms firm gel on cooling 10 Soluble with heating, forms firm gel on cooling Since it was not possible to produce stable and manageable solutions of the C12/14 glucamide, a 20 wt % strength solution in propylene glycol was prepared for the biological tests and the formulation experiments. With the C16/18 glucamide, preparing a propylene glycol solution in the same concentration was not possible. Example 4 Biological Activity of the Adjuvant Compositions For the purpose of determining the biological activity, greenhouse trials were carried out with glyphosate on Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv. (ECHCG), Cirsium arvense L. (CIRAR), and Solanum nigrum L. (SOLNI). The plants were cultivated in a greenhouse under 14 hours of irradiation with light at a temperature of 19/14 (±0.5°) C. (day/night) and a relative humidity of 70/80 (±5)% (day/night). The light was supplied via high-pressure sodium lamps, high-pressure mercury lamps, and fluorescent tubes, producing a power of 70 W/m2 at the leaf level. The plants were grown in 12 cm diameter plastic pots filled with a mixture of sand and humus in a sand:humus ratio of 1:2 by volume. The pots were placed on an under-soil watering mat, which was wetted daily with a medium-strength nutrient solution. Following their appearance at the substrate surface, seedlings were thinned out to five (ECHCG), two (CIRAR), or one (SOLNI) plant per pot for the activity tests. The spray solutions were applied using a laboratory sprayer operated with compressed air and fitted with a Teejet TP8003E nozzle at an application rate of 200 l/ha to the plants at 303 kPa. ECHCG was treated at the two- to three-leaf stage; CIRAR and SOLNI were treated at the four-leaf stage. For the more differentiated examination of the adjuvant effect, the glyphosate active ingredient was underdosed, meaning that the plants are not completely killed. This was done using aqueous solutions of glyphosate-isopropylammonium salt (glyphosate IPA). The amount of glyphosate used was 33.8 g a.e./ha glyphosate IPA (corresponding to 1.0 mmol or 0.17 g a.e./l for a liquid volume of 2001 l/ha) in the case of ECHCG, and at 20.3 g a.e./ha glyphosate IPA (corresponding to 0.6 mmol or 0.10 g a.e./l at a liquid volume of 200 l/ha) for CIRAR and SOLNI. The amount of adjuvant in each of the spray solutions was 0.25 wt %. The differences in the active contents of the products employed were taken into account. The amounts used were corrected—that is, the figure of 0.25 wt % referred in all cases to 100% active content of the adjuvants—and are therefore comparable with one another. An overview of the alkylglucamides and comparison substances tested is given below in Table 2. TABLE 2 Overview of adjuvants A1 to A4 used Adjuvant Composition A1 (inventive) C8/C10-alkyl-N-methylglucamide from example 1, 54 wt % strength solution in water/propylene glycol A2 (comparative) C12/C14-alkyl-N-methylglucamide from example 2, 20 wt % strength solution in propylene glycol A3 (comparative) Genamin ® 267 (tallow fatty amine ethoxylate with 15 mol EO; product of Clariant), 70 wt % strength solution in glycols A4 (comparative) Synergen ® GL 5 (copolymer consisting of glycerol, coconut fatty acid, and phthalic acid; product of Clariant), 70 wt % strength solution in water The activity of the various adjuvants was assessed 14 days after application, by determining the mass of the plant parts still present (fresh weight; FW), and was reported as a percentage fraction, relative to the untreated plant (Table 3). TABLE 3 Effect of adjuvants on activity of glyphosate IPA FW in % FW in % FW in % (ECHCG) (CIRAR) (SOLNI) Untreated plant 100 100 100 Glyphosate IPA 74.3 95.9 84.5 without adjuvant Glyphosate + A1 1.5 31.9 19.2 Glyphosate + A2 42.9 62.2 29.7 Glyphosate + A3 3.2 14.4 8.7 Glyphosate + A4 4.0 33.0 40.9 The result of the experiments shows that the inventive adjuvant composition based on the C8/C10-alkyl-N-methylglucamide (see A1) is much more effective than that based on the longer-chain, non-inventive C12/C14-alkyl-N-methylglucamide (see A2). At the same time a comparable (or higher) activity is achieved than with the commercial products Genamin 267 (see A3) or Synergen GL 5 (see A4). Example 5 Aqueous Glyphosate Compositions Two inventive pesticide compositions were produced from a commercial aqueous solution of glyphosate-isopropylammonium salt (62 wt % strength in water), the adjuvant composition A1, and water. The resulting compositions I1 and I2 contain 360 and 480 g/l glyphosate a.e. (a.e.: acid equivalent). For comparison, two non-inventive pesticide compositions were produced with the C12/C14-alkyl-N-methylglucamide (A2) and also Genamin 267 (A3) and Synergen GL 5 (A4). The cloud point and the viscosity of the compositions were determined. The cloud point was determined by heating the composition, which was heated until clouding occurred. Thereafter the composition was cooled with stirring and continual temperature monitoring. The temperature at which the clouded solution turns clear again was recorded as the cloud point value. The results are set out in Tables 4 and 5 below. TABLE 4 Glyphosate IPA 360 g/l a.e. formulations Composition I1 C1 (C8/C10—N- (C12/C14—N- methyl methyl C2 C3 glucamide, glucamide, (Genamin (Synergen A1) A2) 267, A3) GL 5, A4) Glyphosate IPA 78.4 78.4 78.4 104.4 (62 wt % strength in H2O) [g] Adjuvant (as is) 12 18 12 12 [g] Adjuvant 6.5 3.8 8.4 8.4 (calculated on 100 wt %) [g] Water [g] 26.6 20.6 26.6 26.6 Cloud point [° C.] >95 — 87 57 Viscosity at 25 solid 50 53 25° C. [mPa · s] With the non-inventive C12/C14-alkyl-N-methylglucamide (A2) it was not possible to produce a stable glyphosate formulation (experiment C1); only a firm-consistency gel was formed. No attempt was therefore made to produce a glyphosate composition with an even higher loading (experiment C4). TABLE 5 Glyphosate IPA 480 g/l a.e. formulations Composition I2 C4 (C8/C10—N- (C12/C14—N- methyl methyl C5 C6 glucamide, glucamide, (Genamin (Synergen A1) A2) 267, A3) GL 5, A4) Glyphosate IPA 104.4 — 104.4 104.4 (62 wt % strength in water) [g] Adjuvant (as is) 12 — 12 12 [g] Adjuvant 6.5 — 8.4 8.4 (calculated on 100 wt %) [g] Water [g] 3.6 — 3.6 3.6 Cloud point [° C.] >95 — separates 64 at 25° C. Viscosity at 95 — — 205 25° C. [mPa · s] The experiments make it clear that the inventive adjuvant composition (=A1) gave both stable 360 g/l a.e. and stable 480 g/l a.e. glyphosate IPA formulations, which are distinguished by more advantageous applications properties, specifically by higher cloud point and hence at the same time a lower viscosity as well, in comparison to the non-inventive C12/C14-alkyl-N-methylglucamide (A2) and to the commercial products Genamin 267 (A3) and Synergen GL 5 (A4). Example 6 Aqueous 2,4-D-DMA Compositions An inventive pesticide composition was produced from 76.0 g of aqueous 2,4-D-dimethylammonium salt solution (69 wt % strength), 15.0 g of adjuvant composition A1, and 14.5 g of water. The formulation had an active content of 440 g/l a.e. (acid equivalent) based on 2,4-D. The phase stability of the formulation was determined by ascertaining the cloud point and also the low-temperature stability at 0° C. and −10° C. The formulation showed a cloud point of >95° C. and was homogeneous and phase-stable after storage for a duration of 24 hours both at 0° C. and at −10° C. Example 7 Aqueous Glyphosate/2,4-D Compositions Inventive combined glyphosate/2,4-D formulations in three (3) different proportions (I3, I4, and I5) were produced from aqueous solutions of glyphosate-isopropylammonium salt (62 wt % strength), 2,4-D-dimethylammonium salt (69 wt % strength), and the adjuvant composition A1 (see Table 6). Serving for comparison in each case were three non-inventive compositions, containing Genamin 267 (C7, C8, and C9) and Synergen GL 5 (C10, C11, and C12) in place of A1 (Table 6).
