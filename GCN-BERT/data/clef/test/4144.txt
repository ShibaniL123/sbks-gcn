GOVERNMENT RIGHTS The invention described in this application was supported, at least in part, by United Stated Government Grant No. NIH Grant No. GM48812 with the National Institutes of Health. TECHNICAL FIELD The present application relates to copper amine oxidase inhibitors and to methods of using such inhibitors for therapeutic applications. BACKGROUND There are now known to be three human genes that code for the TPQ-containing amine oxidases, AOC1, AOC2, and AOC3. AOC1 is the diamine oxidase found primarily in kidney (HKDAO), though it is also expressed in the liver and brain. The enzyme is thought to be involved in the catabolism of histamine and of putrescine and other polyamines, important mediators of nuclear events underlying cell proliferation. This suggests a fundamental role of HKDAO in the regulation of growth. At the same time, the H2O2 and aldehydes resulting from polyamine metabolism have been suggested to contribute to apoptotic cell death in brain injury. The presence of DAO at the interface between rapidly dividing (e.g., epithelial) and quiescent cells suggests that it might be involved in regulating cell division or differentiation at tissue boundaries. Involvement of DAO in the metabolism of histamine implicates its role in the progression of inflammation. AOC2 is the retina-specific amine oxidase. The function is not yet clear, and there have been no suggestions in the prior art of a possible therapeutic effect of having a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. AOC3 codes for an amine oxidase, which is also the human vascular adhesion protein (HVAP-1), responsible for the binding of lymphocytes to the endothelial cell surface and the promotion of their transendothelial migration. A number of studies point to this enzyme being a useful anti-inflammatory target. Further, since leukocyte migration from the blood to tissues is a prerequisite for normal immune responses, inhibitors of HVAP-1 will be important for modulating the immune response. This enzyme, responsible for the semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) activity in mammalian tissues, is largely associated with the plasma membrane of various tissues, and is particularly high in vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle cells, but is also found in other cell types such as adipocytes, chondrocytes, and odontoblasts. There are several pathological states where increased circulating SSAO activity has been found: diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, cerebral infarction, uremia, inflammatory liver diseases (e.g., cirrhosis), obesity, and hyperlipidemia. High levels of SSAO are also found in atherosclerotic plaques, and serum SSAO activity correlates with the severity of atherosclerosis, as well as intima-media thickness and serum cholesterol levels. It has been proposed that vascular SSAO is involved in the regulation of vascular tone, and thus vascular SSAO inhibition may offer a novel mechanism of vasodilation. The role of SSAO in the pathophysiology of diabetes has been most extensively investigated. Elevated SSAO activity is associated with type 1 diabetes already at first clinical diagnosis, and in type 2 diabetes, particularly in diabetic patients with vascular complications, such as retinopathy and arteriosclerosis. It has therefore been speculated that SSAO may contribute to the development of vascular complications associated with diabetes. SSAO is associated with translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 into the adipose cell surface and thereby promotes glucose uptake in adipose tissue and smooth muscle cells. SSAO contributes to elevated formation of cytotoxic metabolites (principally methylglyoxal from aminoacetone, formaldehyde from methylamine, and H2O2 as by-product) that exacerbate advanced glycation of proteins (including crosslinking) and cause endothelial injury of blood vessels, resulting in early development of atherosclerosis and late-stage diabetic complications such as neuropathy, retinopathy, and nepropathy. Thus SSAO inhibitors may be ameliorative in the development of atherosclerosis and diabetic complications. Plasma SSAO activity is elevated in morbidly obese patients, which might contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk associated with obesity. A potent, selective SSAO inhibitor was found to reduce atherogenesis in a genetically obese diabetic mouse strain fed a high cholesterol diet. Furthermore, a recent study showed that an antibody to block VAP-1 in mice prevented diabetes in a subset of nonobese diabetic mice. Interestingly, aminoguanidine, which blocks advanced glycation and reduces nephropathy in animals, is more potent at inhibiting SSAO than its affect on glycation. In addition to the LTQ-containing lysyl oxidase (LOX), human genes for four LOX-like proteins have been recently identified: LOXL, LOXL2, LOXL3 and LOXL4. In most tissues, LOX is responsible for the lysine-derived cross-links in collagen and elastin, which is the essential step for biogenesis and repair of the fibrillar extracellular matrix. Despite what should be a harmful effect of lysyl oxidase inhibition early in life, there is growing evidence that the enzyme also plays a role in late-onset fibrotic conditions in man. SUMMARY The present invention relates to a method of inhibiting quinone-dependent copper amine oxidases. In the method, the quinone dependent copper amine oxidase is contacted with an inhibitory amount of a compound selected from the group consisting of propargylamines, such as simple propargylamines, and double or triple bond conjugated propargylamines, trialkylsilyl substituted propargylamines, polypropargylamines, homopropargylamines, 4-substituted-2-butynylamines, 2- and 3-halloallylamines, such as 3-chloroallylamines, 3-(alkoxycarbonyl)-3-chloroallylamines, 2- and 3-aryl-3-haloallylamines, 2-halo-3-arylallylamines, 3-halo-2-methylallylamines, 2-haloallylamines, pyrroline derivatives, cycloalkenyl branched primary amines, propargyl diamines, homopropargyl amines and diamines, allenyl amines and diamines, chloroallyl diamines, lysyne analogues, referring to a propargylamine inside a lysine side-chain, β-haloamines, RF-substituted amines, RCl-substituted amines, and R3Si substituted amines. In an aspect of the invention, the compounds can be used as selective inhibitors of amine oxidases, such as human TPQ-containing amine oxidases (e.g., AOC1, AOC2, AOC3, and SSAO), human LTQ-containing amine oxidases (e.g., LOX, LOXL, LOXL2, LOX3, and LOXL4), as well as other human copper amine oxidases and non-mammalian copper amine oxidases. In another aspect of the invention, the compounds can be used as therapeutic agents for treating a number of inflammatory conditions and diseases of connective tissue, skin, and the gastrointestinal, central nervous system, and pulmonary systems, including such conditions as chronic arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and chronic dermatoses. The therapeutic agents can also be useful for treating diseases related to carbohydrate metabolism (such as diabetes), to aberrations in adipocyte differentiation or function or smooth muscle cell function (such as atherosclerosis and obesity), and to various vascular diseases (such as atheromatous and nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, and peripheral arterial occlusion). The therapeutic agent can further be used for anti-fibrotic chemotherapies, tumor suppression, cellular senescence, developmental control, cell motility (chemotaxis), hepatic fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, and anti-fungal agents. A further aspect of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition useful for treating disorders responsive to an increase in amine oxidase activity, containing an effective amount of the therapeutic agent in a mixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents.

When referring to a compound of the invention, applicants intend the term “compound” to encompass not only the specified molecular entity but also its pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active analogs, including, but not limited to, salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, conjugates, active metabolites, and other such derivatives, analogs, and related compounds. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition administered to a patient without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the composition in which it is contained. When the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” is used to refer to a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient, it is implied that the carrier or excipient has met the required standards of toxicological and manufacturing testing or that it is included on the Inactive Ingredient Guide prepared by the U.S. Food and Drug administration. “Pharmacologically active” (or simply “active”) as in a “pharmacologically active” derivative or analog, refers to a derivative or analog having the same type of pharmacological activity as the parent compound and approximately equivalent in degree. Some of the compounds disclosed herein may contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms. The present invention is also meant to encompass racemic mixtures, resolved forms and mixtures thereof, as well as the individual enantiomers that may be separated according to methods that are well know to those of ordinary skill in the art. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended to include both E and Z geometric isomers. As used herein, the term “stereoisomers” is a general term for all isomers of individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes enantiomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral center that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers). The term “asymmetric center” or “chiral center” refers to a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. The term “enantiomer” or “enantiomeric” refers to a molecule that is nonsuperimposeable on its mirror image and hence optically active wherein the enantiomer rotates the plane of polarized light in one direction and its minor image rotates the plane of polarized light in the opposite direction. The term “racemic” refers to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers and which is optically inactive. The term “resolution” refers to the separation or concentration or depletion of one of the two enantiomeric forms of a molecule.

In a subclass of lysyne analogues, R15 and R16 can each be independently selected from group consisting of H, alkyl, and substituted alkyls. Examples of lysyne of this subclass can include: In accordance with another aspect, the therapeutic agent can comprise a β-haloamine, such as: In accordance with yet another aspect, the therapeutic agent can comprise a RF, RCl, and R3Si substituted amine such as: The therapeutic agents described above can be used for treatment of a disease or condition in a human where selective inhibition of amine oxidases, such as human TPQ-containing amine oxidases (AOC1, AOC2, and AOC3), human LTQ-containing amine oxidases (e.g., LOX, LOXL, LOXL2, LOX3, and LOXL4), as well as other human copper amine oxidases and non-mammalian copper amine oxidases, is beneficial. The present invention therefore provides a method of treating diseases by selectively inhibiting amine oxidase activity, which method comprises administering to an animal in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic agent or compound in accordance with the present invention, wherein one or more compounds or therapeutic agents are administered in association with one or more non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents and/or adjuvants and if desired other active ingredients. The compounds or therapeutic agents in accordance with the present invention can be used to treat inflammatory conditions and diseases including but not limited to connective tissue inflammatory conditions and diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, Behget's syndrome, relapsing polychondritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, eosinophilic fasciitis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, polymyalgia rheumatica, vasculitis, temporal arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis, mixed connective tissue disease, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions and diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome (spastic colon), fibrotic conditions of the liver, inflammation of the oral mucosa (stomatitis), and recurrent aphtous stomatitis; central nervous system inflammatory conditions and diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and ischaemia-reperfusion injury associated with ischemic stroke; pulmonary inflammatory conditions and diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and adult respiratory distress syndrome; and skin inflammatory conditions and diseases such as contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, pityriasis rosea, lichen planus, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Moreover, the therapeutic agents of the invention can be used to treat diseases related to carbohydrate metabolism and complications thereof, such as diabetes and complications of diabetes including, but not limited to microvascular and macrovascular disease such as atherosclerosis, vascular retinopathies, retinopathy, nephropathy and nephrotic syndrome, neuropathies such as polyneuropathy, mononeuropathies, and autonomic neuropathy, and foot ulcers and joint problems, as well as increased risk of infection; diseases related to or caused by aberrations in adipocyte differentiation or function such as atherosclerosis and obesity; and vascular diseases such as atheromatous and nonatheromatous ateriosclerosis, ischemic heart disease including myocardial infarction, peripheral aterial occlusion, thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), and Raynaud's disease and phenomenon. In particular, the present compounds can be used to treat atherosclerosis. It is known that AOC3 (HVAP-1) is expressed on adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and is related to inflammation. Atherosclerotic plaque consists of accumulated intracellular and extracellular lipids, smooth muscle cells, connective tissue, and glycosaminoglycans. The earliest detectable lesion of atherosclerosis is the fatty streak (consisting of lipid-laden foam cells, which are macrophages that have migrated as monocytes from the circulation into the subendothelial layer of the intima), which later evolves into the fibrous plaque (consisting of intimal smooth muscle cells surrounded by connective tissue and intracellular and extracellular lipids). The term “treat inflammation” is intended to include the administration of therapeutic agents of the present invention to a subject for purposes, which can include prophylaxis, amelioration, prevention or cure of an inflammatory condition or disease. Such treatment need not necessarily completely ameliorate the inflammatory condition or disease. Further, such treatment can be used in conjunction with other traditional treatments for reducing the inflammatory condition known to those of skill in the art. In addition, as noted above, LOX is responsible for the lysine-derived cross-links in collagen and elastin, which is the essential step for biogenesis and repair of the fibrillar extracellular matrix. Despite what should be a harmful effect of lysyl oxidase inhibition early in life, there is growing evidence that the enzyme also plays a role in late-onset fibrotic conditions in man. Thus, selective inhibitors can be viewed as potential leads to development of anti-fibrotic chemotherapies. Moreover, in addition to its essential role in connective tissue maturation, several new functions, as varied as tumor suppression, cellular senescence, developmental control, and cell motility (chemotaxis) have been described. Abnormal LOX activity contributes to a number of different diseases including atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysms, pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatic fibrosis. Also, LOX activity is increased in dementia, with LOX-positive plaques being particularly increased Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that LOX in the extracellular matrix may be associated with plaque formation. Mammalian LOX has been shovel to translocate to the nuclei of smooth muscle cells and regulate chromatin structure and transcription. Selective inhibitors allow for crucial breakthroughs in identifying possible tissue-specific function of these enzymes. Moreover, copper amine oxidases are ubiquitous in nature, and there is a possibility that certain bacterial or fungal CAOs may be crucial to their survival. Selective inhibitors of these enzymes can become therapeutic agents in man as anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, or anti-fungal agents. The therapeutic agents can be provided in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered to any animal that can experience the beneficial effects of the compounds of the invention. Foremost among such animals are humans although the invention is not intended to be so limited. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered by any means that achieve their intended purpose. For example, administration can be by parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarticular, intrathecal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or intradermal injections, or by transdermal, buccal, oromucosal, ocular routes or via inhalation. Alternatively, or concurrently, administration can be by the oral route. Particularly preferred is oral administration. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired. In addition to the pharmacologically active compounds, the pharmaceutical preparations of the compounds can contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically. The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are manufactured in a manner that is, itself, known, for example, by means of conventional mixing, granulating, dragee-making, dissolving, or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipients, optionally grinding the resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as saccharides, for example, lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example, tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, as well as binders, such as starch paste, using, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. If desired, disintegrating agents can be added, such as the above-mentioned starches and also carboxymethyl-starch, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Auxiliaries are, above all, flow-regulating agents and lubricants, for example silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium stearate or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings, that, if desired, are resistant to gastric juices. For this purpose, concentrated saccharide solutions can be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. In order to produce coatings resistant to gastric juices, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, are used. Slow-release and prolonged-release formulations may be used with particular excipients such as methacrylic acid—ethylacrylate copolymers, methacrylic acid—ethyl acrylate copolymers, methacrylic acid—methyl methacrylate copolymers and methacrylic acid—methyl methylacrylate copolymers. Dye stuffs or pigments can be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example, for identification or in order to characterize combinations of active compound doses. Other pharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active compounds in the form of granules that may be mixed with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds are preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids such as fatty oils or liquid paraffin. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, for example water-soluble salts and alkaline solutions. Especially preferred salts are maleate, fumarate, succinate, S,S tartrate, or R,R tartrate. In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily injection suspensions can be administered. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, for example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example, ethyl oleate or triglycerides or polyethylene glycol-400 (the compounds are soluble in PEG-400). Aqueous injection suspensions can contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, for example sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, and/or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain stabilizers. The following examples provided are illustrative, but not limiting, of the method and compositions of the present invention. Other suitable modifications and adaptations of the variety of conditions and parameters normally encountered and obvious to those skilled in the art are within the spirit and scope of the invention. EXAMPLES In the following Examples, 0.9 mL aliquots of a solution of candidate inhibitor in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 was mixed bovine plasma amine oxidase (0.1 mL, about 8 AM) and incubated at 30° C. aerobically. Aliquots (0.1 mL) were periodically withdrawn using disposable calibrated Drummond micropipettes and diluted with 1.0 mL of benzylamine (5 mM in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) in a 1 cm quartz cuvette (1.5 mL volume). The rate of oxidation of benzylamine to benzaldehyde was measured by recording the increase in absorbance at 250 nm for 1 minute and compared to the rate of benzylamine oxidation in a companion control solution of enzyme without inhibitor.
