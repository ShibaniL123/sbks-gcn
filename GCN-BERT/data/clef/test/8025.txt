CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/550,279, filed on Oct. 21, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND Numerous serious medical issues arise within the proximal and/or distal aspect of the Gastrointestinal or GI tract. Many of these conditions are related to wall perforation allowing intra luminal content exposure to the abdominal cavity with morbid consequences. Treatment often is difficult and with undesirable outcomes. In the event of post-operative complication of the proximal stomach in the case of a sleeve gastrectomy a staple line dehiscence represents the most feared complication due to the futility of the few available treatment options. Currently the intraluminal expandable metallic covered stents are considered the treatment of choice with a high associated cost and significant complication rate including migration, stomach perforation and inability of removal requiring total gastrectomy. Staple line dehiscence or leakage can create a state of sepsis which is technically challenging and potential harmful to patients. Current self-expanding stents have high rates of distal mobility, may cause bleeding, reflux, non-isolation and prolong time to resolution. Also, there may be a high cost associated with the use of a non FDA approved application. Currently, a non-FDA approved esophageal self-expanding esophageal stent is being used with moderate resolution rates. While this conventional device provides some improvement over prior approaches, it is desirable to provide for improved isolation, distal feeding and negative pressure application which may aid in hastening resolution, recover and potential for prevention. Conventional devices and approaches do not address these desired improvements. Improvements to these conventional approaches to treatment of conditions within the GI tract are desirable.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary aspects of the present invention which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. The present disclosure relates to device such as an intraluminal balloon stent that would potentially allow for a controllable and low pressure secure seal at the proximal and distal aspect of the stent thus better isolating an injury or dehiscence site from the remaining GI tract and allow for forward flow of oral intake. This device may allow for an alternative approach to staple line dehiscence or leakage allowing a simpler and more feasible option for physicians and their patients in resolution. Furthermore, a most distal aspect of this device might permit for distal feeds and improved nutrition instead of intravenous administration of nutrition with its possible resultant complications. Most importantly, the addition of negative pressure to the outside perimeter of the balloon stent would allow for active healing to occur and limit the complication and resources utilization considerably. The addition of a bio-absorbable mesh may improve the application of intraluminal negative pressure. The present application is further directed toward a medical device or catheter that may consist of three hollow inflatable balloons (two hollow inflatable rings connected by a central hollow, preferably more rigid inflatable cylinder balloon) comprising a stent with an opening or a lumen of a varying diameter depending on the location and indication of the intervention. This inflatable stent may be attached to and inseparable from an intraluminal tube having a single plastic layer with radio opaque marking at the level of balloon stent attachment. Furthermore the inflation port may preferably reside along the proximal length of this intraluminal tube. The catheter of the present disclosure will preferably have two lumens. One lumen will preferably exit at the most distal end of the catheter with multiple side perforations for possible distal feeding purposes and the other lumen will preferably exit into the outside periphery of the cylinder balloon for purposes of providing suction and negative pressure application between the device and the wall of the mucosa of the portion of the GI tract where the device is positioned. Due to the diversity of applications and treatment population, varying lengths and volume capacities may be necessary for optimal performance. These length and volume variables may include but are not limited to, the total length of the catheter, the distal most length of the post balloon portion of the catheter, volumetric capacity and size of the ring balloons, and the length, diameter and capacity of the cylinder balloon. Optional applications for an outside perimeter of the cylinder balloon may include the addition of a bio-absorbable mesh or widely available hemostatic agent which could act as a sponge for improved negative pressure and decreased direct mucosal suction injury. The device of the present disclosure differs from conventional GI tract catheters and balloon stents in numerous ways, such as but not limited to: 1. Promoting active healing with negative pressure ability. 2. Distal feeding ability. 3. Involves only soft plastic components. 4. Utilizes air insufflation of balloons instead of self-expandable metals. The device of the present disclosure is an improvement on conventional GI tract catheters and balloon stents in at least the following ways: 1. More cost effective/economic. 2. Highly reproducible with many possible physicians performing intervention. 3. Decreased complication rates including migration, erosion, obstruction and inability of removal. 4. Doesn't necessary require endoscopy for placement, re-positioning or removal. 5. Hastens the healing process and potentially shortens the disability of the patient. 6. Controllable and tighter proximal and distal seal of the stent. The device of the present disclosure may include but is not limited to the following elements or features: 1. A dual lumen catheter 10 of varying length depending on the site and indication of the treatment. One lumen 20 of the catheter may have a proximal port with its effect at the outside perimeter of the multiperforated cylindrical balloon allowing for suction to be applied to a space between the multiperforated cylindrical balloon portion defining a single plastic layer and the interior of the GI tract where the device is positioned. The other lumen 22 and 24 of the catheter may include a distal port exiting at a distal-most aspect of the catheter and will function as infusion or suction of the lumen on the hollow viscera in which the catheter is placed. This tube will preferably exit the nose from the proximal GI tract and anus from the distal GI tract. The single plastic layer may be attached to the proximal and distal ring balloons and to dual lumen catheter so that the single plastic layer may share the side perforations of the proximal port of the dual lumen catheter. 2. Two hollow inflatable ring balloons 18 of varying volume interconnected with a more rigid hollow multiperforated cylinder balloon 12 of varying length which is accessible via the intragastric tube or catheter 10 mentioned in 1. 3. An absorbable mesh may be included on an exterior of balloon 12 to increase effectiveness of the application of negative pressure or suction. The various elements of the device of the present disclosure may be related as follows: Each component may be attached and inseparable. The intraluminal tube may have radiologic markings at the site of proximal and distal attached inflatable ring balloons for accurate positioning under radiologic guidance. The catheter may be positioned through the lumen of the hollow ring/cylinder balloons to limit the direct contact and potential damage to the wall of the stomach/colon. A suction only port may be effective at the outside of the hollow inflatable cylinder balloon and the wall of GI tract. Furthermore, this is the site of the potential absorbable mesh for added negative pressure effect and limitation of suction injury and improved tissue healing. The device of the present disclosure may be used in the following exemplary manner but it is not intended to limit the use of the device to solely this illustrative example: The device may be positioned within the lumen of the stomach and will bypass the area of extravasation illustrated on the previously performed radiologic study or endoscopy identifying the dehiscence. The device may be positioned under guidance allowing the area of extravasation of contrast to be between the radio opaque markings on the catheter. Once in place, the balloons may be inflated and negative pressure applied to the outside of the hollow cylinder balloon (between the hollow ring balloons) and thus isolate and bypass a dehiscence 16 and promote active healing of the injured tissue with negative pressure. The device of the present disclosure may be secured to the nose of the patient for immobility as well as the negative pressure which will aid in limiting its mobility and displacement. The balloons may be deflated at set time intervals to study the injured tissues response and/or extravasation of contrast. Once dehiscence has resolved, such as by being illustrated by lack of extravasation of contrast with all balloons deflated, then the device may be removed and discarded. A device according to the present disclosure may be constructed in the following illustrative manner. It is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure to this exemplary approach to construction and it is intended that the present application may encompass other approaches and techniques of construction. Plastic inflatable hollow ring balloons with connecting hollow multiperforated cylinder balloon make up the inflatable stent which is connected to the single plastic layer at the proximal and distal ring balloons. The single plastic layer may be connected to the dual lumen catheter and share the proximal port side perforations. The catheter lies within the lumen of the balloon stent and thereby limits its contact of the visceral wall/mucosa. An absorbable mesh is an option to be added or deemed necessary on the outside perimeter of the hollow cylinder balloon to aid in the negative pressure to be applied. Silicone molds may be used to individually form all of the inflatable items and then items may then be fused together. Many applications can be used regarding biologic tissue to periphery of hollow cylindrical balloon allowing for a tissue allo-, xenograft for tissue deficiencies. Other applications might include the application of tissue sealants via proximal lumen and applied at level of dehiscence of staple line/leakage site. The following is an illustrative example of how the device of the present disclosure might be used. It is not intended to limit the scope of use of a device according to the present disclosure to this exemplary approach. Trained physicians may apply this device adjacent to proximal or distal GI tract wall perforations allowing limitation of spillage or contamination of the abdominal cavity with the inflation of the balloon stent at the site of the injury and concurrently be involved in active healing process using the negative pressure application. The device may also be used in the case of a staple line dehiscence from a gastric sleeve, for isolation of injury, reduction of pressure at site of injury and negative pressure application at site of injury to quicken the healing process. The device may allow for easy insertion and positioning (and/or re-positioning) and distal feeds if necessary. These positioning or re-positioning actions may be performed under guidance through use of but not limited to radioimaging. This device may be used by ER, radiologist, GI, general, colorectal, thoracic or bariatric surgeons under conscious sedation or general anesthesia via nasogastric or colorectal route to apply negative pressure at a dehiscence site and allow for isolation/diversion of area. This device may be used in prevention and/or therapeutically in esophageal or distal colo anal anastomosis thereby avoiding the complication of dehiscence of staple line.
