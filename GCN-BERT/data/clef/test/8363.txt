CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a Section 371 of International Application No. PCT/EP2010/067749, filed Nov. 18, 2010, which was published in the English language on May 26, 2011, under International Publication No. WO 2011/061252 A2, and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many inflammatory skin disorders often result in unsightly and painful rashes, acne, persistent red veins, and acne-like skin eruptions, such as macules, nodules, and pustules that may ooze or crust. For example, rosacea, generally involves the cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead and the typical age of onset is 30 to 60 years. See e.g., Zuber T. J., Rosacea: Beyond First Blush 32 H OSP. P RACT. 188-189 (1997); THE MERCK MANUAL 813-814 (Keryn A. G. Lane et al. eds. 17th ed. 2001). Many people with rosacea incorrectly assume that they suffer from adult acne, sun or windburn, or the normal effects of aging. The symptoms of rosacea include frequent blushing and frequent irritation of the facial skin and increasingly severe erythema (abnormal redness of the skin) and telangiectasia (visible red lines due to abnormal dilatation of capillary vessels and arterioles). Pimple-like eruptions, which may be solid (called papules or nodules) or puss filled (known as pustules), may develop. Such eruptions often look like acne, but whiteheads or blackheads (open and closed comedones, respectively) are not normally present. More severe symptoms of rosacea include that characterized by rhinophyma (thickened, lobulated overgrowth of the sebaceous glands and epithelial connective tissue of the nose). If left untreated, rosacea can progress to irreversible disfigurement. Rosacea symptoms are often aggravated by sun exposure, changes or extremes in temperature, wind, and consumption of certain foods, such as spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol. There is no known cure for many inflammatory skin disorders, including inflammatory dermatologic disorders of the face, such as rosacea. Current treatments, which are directed to control redness, inflammation, and skin eruptions, are of limited effectiveness in many patients and, generally, can be used only for a limited duration. Standard treatments include avoidance of triggers such as sun exposure, wind exposure, alcohol consumption, spicy foods, and irritating facial cleansers, lotions, and cosmetics. Antibiotics are the traditional first line of therapy. Long-term treatment (5 to 8 weeks or more) with oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline or clarithromycin may control skin eruptions. Alternative oral treatments include vitamin A medications, such as isoretinoin and antifungal medications. Unfortunately, such oral medications often cause side effects and many people have limited tolerance. Topical treatments, such as with topically applied metronidazole, isoretinoin, steroids, azelaic acid, rentinoic acid or retinaldehyde, or vitamin C preparations, are available but have limited effectiveness and cannot treat all symptoms. For example, isoretinoin has serious teratogenic side-effects and female patients of child bearing age must use effective birth control or avoid the therapy. Surgery, such as the laser elimination of blood vessels, is typically a last resort and may be prescribed if other treatments are ineffective. In patients with nose hyperplasia, surgical reduction may improve the patient's cosmetic appearance, but does not treat the disease itself. Mixed light pulse (photoderm) therapy has proved somewhat effective for symptoms associated with certain inflammatory skin orders, such as rosacea, in some patients. Agonists of the α2 adrenoceptors have been used therapeutically for a number of conditions including hypertension, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, spasticity, glaucoma, diarrhea, and for the suppression of opiate withdrawal symptoms (J. P. Heible and R. R. Ruffolo Therapeutic Applications of Agents Interacting with α-Adrenoceptors, p. 180-206 in Progress in Basic and Clinical Pharmacology Vol. 8, P. Lomax and E. S. Vesell Ed., Karger, 1991). Adrenoreceptor agonists, such as clonidine, have been primarily used orally, though a patch formulation is known. Systemic side effects have been associated with the use of agonists of the α2 adrenoceptors. The side effects include, for example, cardiopulmonary effects of β-blockers like timolol; dryness of mouth, flush, fever, tachycardia, urinary retention, convulsion and irritability with atropine; hypertension with phenylephine; increased salivation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, bronchial secretions, brionchial constriction, asthma, bradycardia, paresthesia with miotics; hypotension with clonidine; and dry mouth, fatigue and drowsiness with apraclonidine and brimonidine. See Canadian Patent No. CA2326690. Published US Patent Application US20050276830 discloses α2 adrenergic receptor agonists and their use for treating or preventing inflammatory skin disorders. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) have been used to reduce inflammation and as analgesics. However, NSAIDS are associated with a wide spectrum of undesirable side-effects. For example, use of NSAIDs can cause direct and indirect irritation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), resulting in a number of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as nausea, dyspepsia, gastric ulceration/bleeding, and diarrhea. Risk of ulceration increases with long duration and with higher doses of NSAIDs. NSAIDs are also associated with a relatively high incidence of renal ADRs, such as salt and fluid retention and hypertension, and in rare instances, more severe renal conditions, such as interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, acute renal failure, and acute tubular necrosis. A meta-analysis of trials comparing NSAIDs found that, with the exception of naproxen, both the selective Cox-2 inhibitor and the traditional NSAID are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk (Kearney et al, BMJ 332:1302-1308 (2006)). Accordingly, there remains a need of novel methods and compositions for ameliorating inflammatory skin disorders, such as rosacea, and their symptoms, with no or very little side effect. Such methods and compositions are described in the present application. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is now discovered that a combination of an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, resulted in a major improvement in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders, with no or little side effects. In one general aspect, embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of treating or preventing an inflammatory skin disorder or a sign and/or symptom associated therewith in a subject.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Various publications, articles and patents are cited or described in the background and throughout the specification; each of these references is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which has been included in the present specification is for the purpose of providing context for the present invention. Such discussion is not an admission that any or all of these matters form part of the prior art with respect to any inventions disclosed or claimed. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains. Otherwise, certain terms used herein have the meanings as set in the specification. All patents, published patent applications and publications cited herein are incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein. It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. As used herein, the term “inflammatory skin disorder or a sign and/or symptom associated therewith” and “an inflammatory dermatologic disorder” mean any disease or medical condition associated with the skin, nails, or mucosal membranes displaying signs and/or symptoms of redness, flushing, burning, scaling, acne (pimples, papules, pustules (particularly in the absence of whiteheads and blackheads)), telangiectasis, sores, surface irritation or pain, itching, and/or inflammation. The degree or the severity of the disease or medical condition may vary. Exemplary inflammatory skin disorders or signs and/or symptoms associated therewith include, but are not limited to, dermatitis, such as contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, nummular dermatitis, generalized exfoliative dermatitis, statis dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus; disorders of hair follicles and sebaceous glands, such as acne, rosacea and rhinophyma, perioral dermatitis, and pseudofolliculitis barbae; and inflammatory reactions, such as drug eruptions, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, and granuloma annulare. In a preferred embodiment, the topical formulations of the invention are used to treat or prevent inflammatory dermatologic disorders of the face, such as rosacea. There are four subtypes of rosacea: subtype I: erythematotelangiectactic rosacea (ETR): subtype II: papulopustular rosacea (PPR); subtype III: phymatous rosacea (PR); and subtype IV: ocular rosacea. Each subtype is then graded according to disease severity. See Wilkin J et al, 2004, J Am Acad Dermatol. 2004 June; 50(6):907-12; and Wilkin J et al, 2002, J Am Acad Dermatol. 2002 April; 46(4):584-7). This classification and grading system, based on clinical diagnosis, has helped to clarify the various components of rosacea and assisted clinicians in selecting therapy. But it is not known whether the different subtypes of rosacea represent different successive steps in the evolution of the disease or represent different diseases. The term “inflammatory skin disorder or a sign and/or symptom associated therewith” is intended to encompass all four subtypes of rosacea. As used herein, an “α2 adrenergic receptor agonist” or “agonist of α2 adrenoceptor” means a compound that binds to and selectively stimulates alpha adrenergic receptor subclass α2. Such compounds can have powerful vasoconstricting effects when introduced into the body of mammals, particularly humans. As used herein, the term “non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent” or “NSAID” refers to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound that inhibits the production of prostaglandins (PGs), which act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. Most NSAIDs act as non-selective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), including COX-1, COX-2, and possibly other COX isoenzymes. COX catalyzes the formation of PGs and thromboxane, primarily from arachidonic acid. As used herein, the term “alkyl” means a saturated, monovalent, unbranched or branched hydrocarbon chain. Examples of alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, (C1-C3) alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, and (C4-C8) alkyl groups, such as 2-methyl-1-propyl, 2-methyl-2-propyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, 3-methyl-1-butyl, 2-methyl-3-butyl, 2,2-dimethyl-1-propyl, 2-methyl-pentyl, 3-methyl-1-pentyl, 4-methyl-1-pentyl, 2-methyl-2-pentyl, 3-methyl-2-pentyl, 4-methyl-2-pentyl-2,2-dimethyl-1-butyl, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butyl, 2-ethyl-1-butyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, and the like. An alkyl group can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more suitable substituents. As used herein, the term “alkoxy” means an oxygen ether radical of an alkyl. Examples of alkoxy include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, sec-butoxy, t-butoxy, n-hexyloxy and the like. An alkoxy group can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more suitable substituents. When a particular group is “substituted” (e.g., alkyl, alkoxy), that group can have one or more substituents, preferably from one to five substituents, more preferably from one to three substituents, most preferably from one to two substituents, independently selected from the list of substituents. With reference to substituents, the term “independently” means that when more than one of such substituents is possible, such substituents may be the same or different from each other. As used herein, the term “halogen” means fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Correspondingly, the term “halo” means fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo. As used herein, the name of a compound is intended to encompass all possible existing isomeric forms (e.g., optical isomer, enantiomer, diastereomer, racemate or racemic mixture), esters, prodrugs, metabolite forms, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, of the compound. For example, “brimonidine” can be the compound (5-bromo-quinoxalin-6-yl)-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-amine, and any pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound, such as brimonidine tartrate; “diclofenac” can be the compound 2-[2-(2,6-dichlorophenylamino)phenyl]acetic acid, and any pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound, such as the sodium or potassium salt of diclofenac. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s)”, as used herein, means those salts of a compound of interest that are safe and effective for topical use in mammals and that possess the desired biological activity. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include salts of acidic or basic groups present in the specified compounds. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include, but are not limited to, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzensulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate (i.e., 1,1′-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. Certain compounds used in the present invention can form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with various amino acids. Suitable base salts include, but are not limited to, aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc, and diethanolamine salts. For a review on pharmaceutically acceptable salts see BERGE ET AL., 66 J. PHARM. SCI. 1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference. As used herein, the term “hydrate” means a compound of interest, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of water bound to it by non-covalent intermolecular forces. The term “topically administrable composition,” a “topical composition,” or a “topical formulation,” as used herein, means any formulation or composition which is pharmaceutically and/or cosmetically acceptable for topical delivery of the specified compounds according to the invention. Exemplary forms of formulation that can be used for topical administration include, but are not limited to, sprays, mists, aerosols, solutions, lotions, gels, creams, ointments, pastes, unguents, emulsions, and suspensions. The choice of topically administrable composition will depend on several factors, including the nature of the symptoms to be treated or prevented, the physiochemical characteristics of the particular compound to be administered and of other excipients present, their stability in the formulation, available manufacturing equipment, and cost constraints. As used herein, the term “composition” is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. As used herein, “carbomer” is the USP designation for various polymeric acids that are dispersible but insoluble in water. When the acid dispersion is neutralized with a base a clear, stable gel is formed. Carbomer 934P is physiologically inert and is not a primary irritant or sensitizer. Other carbomers include 910, 940, 941, and 1342. As used herein, the term “subject” means any animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, to whom will be or has been administered compounds or topical formulations according to embodiments of the invention. The term “mammal” as used herein, encompasses any mammal. Examples of mammals include, but are not limited to, cows, horses, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, monkeys, humans etc., more preferably, a human. Preferably, a subject is in need of, or has been the object of observation or experiment of treatment or prevention of an inflammatory skin disorder and symptoms associated therewith. As used herein, the term “instructions” when used in the context of a kit includes a publication, a recording, a diagram or any other medium of expression which can be used to communicate the usefulness of the kit for its designated use. The instructions can, for example, be affixed to or included within a container for the kit. In one embodiment, “treatment” or “treating” refers to an amelioration, prophylaxis, or reversal of a disease or disorder, or at least one discernible symptom thereof, for example, treating an inflammatory skin disorder (e.g., rosacea) by lessening the redness of the skin. In another embodiment, “treatment” or “treating” refers to an amelioration, prophylaxis, or reversal of at least one measurable physical parameter related to the disease or disorder being treated, not necessarily discernible in or by the mammal. In yet another embodiment, “treatment” or “treating” refers to inhibiting or slowing the progression of a disease or disorder, either physically, e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom, physiologically, e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter, or both. In yet another embodiment, “treatment” or “treating” refers to delaying the onset of a disease or disorder. In certain embodiments, compounds of interest are administered as a preventative measure. As used herein, “prevention” or “preventing” refers to a reduction of the risk of acquiring a given disease or disorder. In a preferred mode of the embodiment, the specified compounds are administered as a preventative measure to a subject having a predisposition to a inflammatory skin disorder, such as rosacea, even though symptoms of the disorder are absent or minimal. As used herein, a “therapeutically effective amount of an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist” means the amount of the α2 adrenergic receptor agonist that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount of an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist is effective to treat, improve the treatment of, or prophylactically prevent an inflammatory skin disorder or a sign and/or symptom associated therewith.

TABLE 1 Representative α2 adrenergic receptor agonists Compound Formula Compound Name (5-Bromo- quinoxalin- 6-yl)-(4,5- dihydro-1H- imidazol-2-yl)- amine (Brimonidine) (8-Bromo- quinoxalin- 6-yl)-(4,5- dihydro-1H- imidazol-2-yl)- amine (8-Bromo- quinoxalin- 5-yl)-(4,5- dihydro-1H- imidazol-2-yl)- amine (5-Bromo-3- methyl- quinoxalin- 6-yl)-(4,5 dihydro-1H- imidazol- 2-yl)-amine (5-Bromo-2- methoxy- quinoxalin- 6-yl)-(4,5- dihydro-1H- imidazol- 2-yl)-amine (4,5-dihydro-1H- imidazol-2-yl)-(8- methyl-quinoxalin- 6-yl)-amine (4,5-dihydro-1H- imidazol-2-yl)- quinoxalin-5-yl- amine Tetrahydrozaline Naphazoline Oxymetazoline Xylometazoline Epinephrine Norepinephrine Phenylephrine Methoxyamine The most preferred α2 adrenergic receptor agonist is brimonidine, (5-Bromo-quinoxalin-6-yl)-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-amine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, such as the tartrate salt of brimonidine. Other examples of α2 adrenergic receptor agonists that can be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, Dexmedetomidinc, Medetomidine, Romifidine, Clonidine, Detomidine, Lofexidine, Xylazine, Tizanidine, Guanfacine, and Amitraz. In an embodiment of the present invention, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent is selected from the group consisting of diclofenac, aspirin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, piroxicam, naproxen, sulindac, choline subsalicylate, diflunisal, fenoprofen, indomethacin, meclofenamate, salsalate, tolmetin, and magnesium salicylate. Preferably, the NSAID is diclofenac, 2-[2-(2,6-dichlorophenylamino)phenyl]acetic acid and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, such as the sodium or potassium salt of diclofenac. In a preferred embodiment, the method of the present invention comprises topically administering to the skin of a subject a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of brimonidine, a therapeutically effective amount of diclofenac, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One skilled in the art will recognize that the therapeutically effective amount of the α2 adrenergic receptor agonist and the therapeutically effective amount of the NSAID to be used in the instant invention can vary with factors, such as the particular subject, e.g., age, diet, health, etc., severity and complications of the inflammatory skin disorder sought to be treated or prevented, the formulation used, etc. In view of the present disclosure, standard procedures can be performed to evaluate the effect of the administration of a topical composition to a subject, thus allowing a skilled artisan to determine the therapeutically effective amount of the α2 adrenergic receptor agonist and the therapeutically effective amount of the NSAID to be administered to the subject. For example, the clinically observable beneficial effect of the combination of the α2 adrenergic receptor agonist and NSAID in treating an inflammatory skin disorder or a sign and/or symptom associated therewith can be observed or monitored directly from the subject. The clinically observable beneficial effect can be a situation that, when a composition of the present invention is administered to a subject after signs and/or symptoms related to an inflammatory skin disorder are observable, the signs and/or symptoms are prevented from further development or aggravation, or develop to a lesser degree than without administration of the specified composition according to embodiments of the present invention. The clinically observable beneficial effect can also be that, when a composition of the present invention is administered to a subject before signs and/or symptoms related to an inflammatory skin disorder are observable, the signs and/or symptoms are prevented from occurring or subsequently occur to a lesser degree than without administration of the composition of the present invention. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of the α2 adrenergic receptor agonist in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of NSAID will reduce a syndrome or a condition of discomfort of the subject associated with the inflammatory skin disorder or a sign and/or symptom associated therewith by at least about 20%, for example, by at least about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, or about 100%. In another embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of the α2 adrenergic receptor agonist in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of NSAID will prevent a syndrome or a condition of discomfort of the subject associated with the inflammatory skin disorder or a sign and/or symptom associated therewith, or reduce the probability of its onset by at least about 20%, for example, by at least about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, or about 100%. Methods of the present invention can be used in conjunction with one or more other treatments and medications for the inflammatory skin disorder or a sign and/or symptom associated therewith, such as those disclosed in THE MERCK MANUAL 811-830 (Keryn A. G. Lane et al. eds. 17th ed. 2001), hereby incorporated herein by reference. The other medicament or treatment can be administered to the subject simultaneously with, or in a sequence and within a time interval of, the combined therapy of the α2 adrenergic receptor agonist and NSAID, such that the active ingredients or agents can act together to treat or prevent inflammatory skin disorders (e.g., rosacea) and signs and/or symptoms associated therewith. For example, the other medicament or treatment, the α2 adrenergic receptor agonist and the NSAID can be administered in the same or separate formulations at the same or different times.

In one embodiment, the topically administrable composition of the invention is in the form of an emulsion. Emulsions, such as creams and lotions are suitable topical formulations for use in the invention. An emulsion is a dispersed system comprising at least two immiscible phases, one phase dispersed in the other as droplets ranging in diameter from 0.1 μm to 100 μm. An emulsifying agent is typically included to improve stability. When water is the dispersed phase and an oil is the dispersion medium, the emulsion is termed a water-in-oil emulsion. When an oil is dispersed as droplets throughout the aqueous phase as droplets, the emulsion is termed an oil-in-water emulsion. Emulsions, such as creams and lotions that can be used as topical carriers and their preparation are disclosed in REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY 282-291 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed. 19th ed. 1995), hereby incorporated herein by reference. In another embodiment, the topically administrable composition of the invention is in the form of a gel, for example, a two-phase gel or a single-phase gel. Gels are semisolid systems consisting of suspensions of small inorganic particles or large organic molecules interpenetrated by a liquid. When the gel mass comprises a network of small discrete inorganic particles, it is classified as a two-phase gel. Single-phase gels consist of organic macromolecules distributed uniformly throughout a liquid such that no apparent boundaries exist between the dispersed macromolecules and the liquid. Suitable gels for use in the invention are disclosed in REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY 1517-1518 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed. 19th ed. 1995), hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Preferably, the label includes the dosage and administration instructions, the topical formulation's composition, the clinical pharmacology, drug resistance, pharmacokinetics, absorption, bioavailability, and contraindications. This invention will be better understood by reference to the non-limiting examples that follow, but those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the examples are only illustrative of the invention as described more fully in the claims which follow thereafter. Example 1 Gel Formulation An exemplary gel formulation is prepared using methods known in the art, e.g., by mixing the following ingredients at the specified concentrations: Ingredient Weight Percentage Brimonidine tartrate 0.18% Diclofenac sodium 0.30% Carbomer 934P 1.25% Methylparaben 0.3% Phenoxyethanol 0.4% Glycerin 5.5% 10% Titanium dioxide 0.625% Propylene glycol 5.5% 10% NaOH Solution 6.5% DI Water QS TOTAL 100% Example 2 Improved Anti-Inflammatory Activity of the Combination of Brimonidine and Diclofenac in TPA-Induced Edema Animal Model The 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced edema animal model was used to demonstrate the improved anti-inflammatory effect of brimonidine and diclofenac. All procedures involving animals were conducted in a fully accredited animal facility and in accordance with preapproved protocols. The edema inducer, TPA, was dissolved in ethanol at 0.01% by weight to obtain a TPA solution (“TPA solution”). Test compounds, brimonidine (CD07805) and diclofenac (CD08100/02), were dissolved in the TPA solution alone or in combination at desired concentrations. Positive control compound, betametasone valerate (CD0153), was dissolved in the TPA solution at 0.01% by weight. Twenty (20) μl of each of the TPA solution (negative control), the test compound dissolved in the TPA solution, or the positive control dissolved in the TPA solution, was topically applied to an ear of the normal, 8-9 week old, female mice (BALB/c ByJ Rj). Different compounds at different dosages were tested on 10 groups of animals, each group having 5 mice (see Table 2). TABLE 2 Groups of animals used in the TPA-induced edema experiment Animal Groups: (compounds/dose) identification Group 1: Ethanol 1 to 5 Group 2: TPA at 0.01% 6 to 10 Group 3: TPA + CD0153 at 0.01% 11 to 15 Group 4: TPA + CD07805 at 0.2% 16 to 20 Group 5: TPA + CD08100/02 at 0.1% 21 to 25 Group 6: TPA + CD08100/02 at 0.3% 26 to 30 Group 7: TPA + CD08100/02 at 1% 31 to 35 Group 8: TPA + CD07805 at 0.2% + CD08100/02 at 0.1% 36 to 40 Group 9: TPA + CD07805 at 0.2% + CD08100/02 at 0.3% 41 to 45 Group 10: TPA + CD07805 at 0.2% + CD08100/02 at 1% 46 to 50 CD0153 is betametasone valerate, and TPA is 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. The ear thickness of each of the 50 animals was measured at 6 hours after the compound application. After the measurement, the animals were sacrificed by carbon dioxide following a preapproved protocol. The mean of the ear thickness measured from 5 animals in each of the 10 groups was calculated. The anti-inflammatory activity of a test compound was measured by its ability to reduce TPA-induced ear edema, i.e., as the percentage of reduction in ear thickness of animals treated with both the test compound and TPA as compared with that treated with TPA alone. As shown in Table 3 and FIG. 1, after a single topical application, 0.2% brimonidine (CD07805) alone reduced TPA-induced ear edema in mice by 46.3%, demonstrating a moderate anti-inflammatory effect. Diclofenac (CD08100/02) alone at 0.1%, 0.3% and 1%, reduced TPA-induced ear edema in mice by 63.8%, 60.0% and 70.0%, respectively, demonstrating a moderate to strong anti-inflammatory effect. Surprisingly, the combination of 0.2% brimonidine (CD07805) with diclofenac (CD08100/02) at 0.1%, 0.3% and 1%, completely reduced TPA-induced ear edema in mice, i.e., by 100%, at all three diclofenac concentrations tested.

These results demonstrate that topical administration of a combination of an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent resulted in improved treatment of an inflammatory skin disorder. Example 3 Improved Anti-Inflammatory Activity of the Combination of Brimonidine and Diclofenac in Arachidonic Acid-Induced Acute Edema Animal Model The arachidonic acid (AA)-induced acute edema animal model was used to further demonstrate the improved anti-inflammatory effect of brimonidine and diclofenac. All procedures involving animals were conducted in a fully accredited animal facility and in accordance with the preapproved protocols. The edema inducer, arachidonic acid, was dissolved in a solution of tetrahydrofuran (THF): methanol (1:1) at 4% by weight to obtain an arachidonic acid solution (AA solution). Test compounds, brimonidine (CD07805) and diclofenac (CD08100/02), were dissolved in the AA solution alone or in combination at desired concentrations. Positive control compound, indomethacin (CD0016), was dissolved in the AA solution at 5% by weight. Twenty (20) μl of each of the AA solution (negative control), the test compound dissolved in the AA solution, or the positive control dissolved in the AA solution was applied on the internal side of the right ear of the normal, 8-9 week old, female mice (BALB/c ByJ Rj). Different compounds at different dosages were tested on 10 groups of animals, each group having 5 mice (see Table 4). TABLE 4 Groups of animals used in the AA-induced edema experiment Animal Groups: (compounds/dose) identification Group 1: THF/Methanol 1 to 5 Group 2: Arachidonic acid 4% 6 to 10 Group 3: AA + CD0016 at 5% 11 to 15 Group 4: AA + CD07805 at 0.2% 16 to 20 Group 5: AA + CD08100/02 at 0.1% 21 to 25 Group 6: AA + CD08100/02 at 0.3% 26 to 30 Group 7: AA + CD08100/02 at 1% 31 to 35 Group 8: AA + CD07805 at 0.2% + CD08100/02 at 0.1% 36 to 40 Group 9: AA + CD07805 at 0.2% + CD08100/02 at 0.3% 41 to 45 Group 10: AA + CD07805 at 0.2% + CD08100/02 at 1% 46 to 50 The ear thickness of each of the 50 animals was measured at 0, 1, 2 and 4 hours after the compound application. After the last measurement, the animals were sacrificed by carbon dioxide following a preapproved protocol. The mean of the ear thickness measured from 5 animals in each of the 10 groups was calculated. The anti-inflammatory activity of a test compound was measured by its ability to reduce AA-induced ear edema, i.e., as the percentage of reduction in ear thickness of animals treated with the test compound and AA as compared with that treated with AA alone. As shown in Table 5 and FIG. 2, after a single topical application, 0.2% brimonidine (CD07805) alone reduced AA-induced ear edema in mice by up to 80.8%, demonstrating a moderate to strong anti-inflammatory effect. Diclofenac (CD08100/02) alone at 0.1%, 0.3% and 1%, reduced AA-induced ear edema in mice by up to 71.2%, 80.6% and 83.9%, respectively, also demonstrating a moderate to strong anti-inflammatory effect. Surprisingly, the combination of 0.2% brimonidine (CD07805) with diclofenac (CD08100/02) at 0.1%, 0.3% and 1%, completely reduced AA-induced ear edema in mice, i.e., by up to 100%, at all three diclofenac concentrations tested. The anti-inflammatory effect of the combination of brimonidine and diclofenac was stronger than that of 5% indomethacin (CD0016), which reduced AA-induced ear edema in mice by up to 94.2% under the same testing conditions. As shown in Table 6, the combination of brimonidine and diclofenac significantly improved the anti-inflammatory effect of diclofenac at all three concentrations tested and all three time measurements. These results confirmed those obtained from the TPA-induced ear edema study. They further demonstrate that topical administration of a combination of an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent resulted in improved treatment of an inflammatory skin disorder.
