Additive for hydraulically setting compounds The invention relates to an additive for hydraulically setting compositions which is suitable more particularly as a slump retainer. Hydraulically setting compositions which comprise aqueous slurries of hydraulic and/or mineral binder with pulverulent inorganic and/or organic substances, such as clays, finely ground silicates, chalks, carbon blacks, or finely ground minerals, find broad application for example in the form of concretes, mortars or plasters. It is known that hydraulically setting compositions are admixed, for the purpose of improving their processing properties - that is, kneadability, spreadability, sprayability, pumpability or fluidity - with additives which comprise polymeric dispersants. Additives of this kind are able to prevent the formation of agglomerates of solids, to disperse existing particles and those newly formed by hydration, and in this way to improve the processing properties. Additives which comprise polymeric dispersants are also particularly used specifically in the preparation of hydraulically setting compositions which comprise hydraulic and/or mineral binders such as (Portland) cement, slag sand, flyash, silica dust, metakaolin, natural pozzolans, burnt oil shale, calcium aluminate cement, lime, gypsum, hemihydrate, anhydrite or mixtures of two or more of these components. In order to bring these hydraulically setting compositions, based on the stated binders, into a ready-to-use, processable form, it is generally necessary to use substantially more mixing water than is necessary for the subsequent hardening process. In the concrete structure, the cavities that are formed by the excess water, which subsequently evaporates, reduce the mechanical strength and resistance. In order to reduce the fraction of excess water for a given processing consistency, and/or to improve the processing properties for a given water/binder ratio, additives are used which are identified generally as water reducers or plasticizers. Water reducers or plasticizers used in practice are more particularly polymers which are obtained by radical polymerization and are based on carboxyl-containing monomers and on polyethylene glycol-containing olefinic monomers, these polymers also being referred to as polycarboxylate ethers (abbreviated to “PCEs”). These polymers have a carboxyl-containing main chain with polyethylene glycol-containing side chains, and are also identified as comb polymers. Divided off from the water reducers and plasticizers, which produce plasticization of freshly prepared concrete when added in relatively low amounts, are the consistency agents or slump-maintaining additives, referred to below as slump retainers, which achieve the same initial plasticization, only when added at relatively high levels, but bring about a constant slump flow spread over time. In contrast to the addition of water reducers, the addition of slump retainers allows good processing properties to be extended for up to, for example, 90 minutes after the mixing of the concrete, whereas with water reducers the processing properties deteriorate significantly after usually just 10 to 30 minutes. A characteristic of the comb polymers known to date in the prior art is that depending on certain polymer-specific parameters it is possible deliberately to produce a water reducer or else a slump retainer. These polymer-specific parameters include the number of carboxyl groups or other acid groups, the number and length of the polyethylene glycol side chains, and the molecular weight. An adjustment between water reduction effect and slump retention effect through a corresponding selection of aforementioned polymer-specific parameters is nevertheless possible only a priori by means of synthetic or polymerization measures in the laboratory or in a chemical production plant. In these cases, corresponding types of acid monomers and polyethylene glycol-containing macromonomers are usually selected and polymerized in certain molar ratios. As a result of the stipulation made in the production process, the conversion of a water reducer into a slump retainer, or vice versa, at the site of the concrete processing is not possible according to the prior art. In the art, generally speaking, water reducers and slump retainers are used in varying proportions in formulations. By means of formulating measures, however, the possibilities of improving slump retention are only very limited, it being difficult in particular to improve slump retention without at the same time adversely affecting other properties of the concrete. For instance, a formulation with slump retainers does result in better slump retention, as disclosed for example in WO 2009/004348 in connection with phosphonates and in JP 57067057Α in connection with sugars. However, the retention of the slump is bought only at the expense of poorer early strengths. Other methods for retaining slump in a cementitious binder dispersion have been disclosed in the prior art over time: The use of high-performance plasticizers based on polycarboxylate ether with hydrolysable acrylic esters, known as “dynamic superplasticizers”, as described in ΕΡ 1 136 508 Α1 and WO 2010/029117. This technology allows the time-controlled adsorption of plasticizer polymers on to the surfaces of the cement particles, the retention of the slump being improved by hydrolysis of corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives (e.g. acrylic esters) in the alkaline medium represented by the concrete. The “dynamic superplasticizer” properties as well are laid down by synthetic or polymerizational measures within the laboratory or in a chemical production plant, and cannot be adjusted flexibly at the site of the concrete processing. Furthermore, use is made of crosslinked polycarboxylate ethers which are crosslinked by monomers having more than one polymerizable function, such as di(meth)acrylates, for example. Under the strongly basic conditions of the cementitious pore water, the crosslinking structural units undergo hydrolysis, crosslinking is halted, and the non-crosslinked (co)polymer, which is active as a plasticizer, is released over time (W02000/048961). The properties of these crosslinked polycarboxylate ethers as well are laid down by synthetic or polymerizational measures in the laboratory or in a chemical production plant, and cannot be adjusted flexibly at the site of the concrete processing. Moreover, the risk exists of an unintended premature hydrolysis during the storage of the products. US7879146 Β2 discloses the preparation of double layer hydroxides based on divalent metal cations (e.g. Ni2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ and/or Ca2+) and trivalent metal cations (e.g. Al3+, Ga3+, Fe3+ and/or Cr3+). The double layer hydroxides are able to intercalate anions such as nitrates, hydroxides, carbonates, sulfates and chlorides. The inorganic products are treated at elevated temperature (65°C) for a number of hours and then dried under reduced pressure at 100°C. In a subsequent ion exchange operation, organic molecules are intercalated into the thus-prepared double layer hydroxides, examples of such molecules being naphthalenesulfonates, derivatives of nitrobenzoic acid, salicylic acid, citric acid, polyacrylic acids, polyvinyl alcohol and a superplasticizer based on a sodium salt of polynaphthalenesulfonic acid (PNS). The polynaphthalenesulfonic acid (PNS) sodium salts modified inorganically by double layer hydroxides produce only a slightly improved slump retention in a mortar test. For many applications, this improvement is not sufficient. ΕΡ 2 412 689 describes a nano-hybrid additive for concrete, comprising a layered double hydroxide and a polyurethane copolymer, the additive being prepared by mixing the two components and by hydrothermal treatment. The additive is said to prevent the breakdown of underwater concrete induced by chloride ions and to prevent the decomposition of concrete as a result of the use of deicing agents, such as calcium chloride, in winter. Disadvantageous are the long synthesis times of > 6 h and the required high temperatures of 80 to 100°C for the hydrothermal preparation of the double layer hydroxides. Furthermore, with this method as well, the properties of the hybrid are necessarily laid down in a complicated synthesis procedure in a chemical production plant. European patent application 12177399.8, moreover, describes a slump retention additive that comprises an aqueous, colloidally disperse preparation of at least one salt of a polyvalent metal cation and of at least one polymeric dispersant, the polymeric dispersant comprising anionic and/or anionogenic groups and polyether side chains. The diverse requirements imposed on the performance profile of concretes are subject to nationally specific regulations and standardizations, and are heavily dependent on the conditions prevailing at the particular building site, such as the weathering conditions, for instance. Slump retention in particular is heavily dependent on the conditions prevailing at the respective construction site. Since the weathering conditions prevailing from one construction site to another may be very different, there is a need within the construction industry to eliminate the above-described deficiencies of the prior art. The invention is therefore based on the object of providing efficient slump retainers. These slump retainers ought to be able to ensure sufficient slump retention under the conditions prevailing on the construction site, without adversely affecting other concrete properties, such as the early strength, for example.

In all embodiments according to the invention, the polyvalent metal cation is present in substochiometric or stochiometric amount, calculated as cation equivalents, based on the sum total of the anionic and anionogenic groups in the polymeric dispersant. The sum of the product of charge number zs,j and number of mole ns,j in mmol/g in the polymeric dispersant can be determined by various known methods, as for example by determination by charge density titration with a polycation as described for example in J. Plank et al., Cem. Concr. Res. 2009, 39, 1-5. Moreover, the skilled person familiar with the state of the art is capable of determining this value in a simple calculation (see calculation for example 478) from the initial weighings of monomers for the synthesis of the polymeric dispersant. Lastly it is possible to obtain the numerical value of the sum of the product of zs and ns experimentally, by determining the ratios of the polymer units by means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). This is done by utilizing in particular the integration of the signals in the 1H-NMR spectrum of a dissolved polymeric dispersant. The polyvalent metal cation is preferably selected from Al3+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2*, Ba2+ and mixtures thereof, more preferably selected from Al3+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+and mixtures thereof, very preferably selected from Al3+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Ca2+ and mixtures thereof. The particularly preferred metal cation is Ca2+. The counteranion of the water-soluble salt of the polyvalent metal cation is preferably selected such that the salts are readily water-soluble, the solubility under standard conditions of 20°C and atmospheric pressure being preferably greater than 10 g/l, more preferably greater than 100 g/l and very preferably greater than 200 g/l. The numerical value of the solubility relates here to the total mass of dissolved metal cations and counteranions that comes about in the equilibrium state when the water-soluble salt is dissolved in deionized water at 20°C under atmospheric pressure. The solubility takes no account of the effects of protonation equilibriums (pH) and complexation equilibriums, i.e. the value for the solubility applies to the pH obtained on dissolution. The counteranion is preferably singly charged and selected from nitrate, acetate, formate, hydrogensulfate, halide, halate, cyanide, azide, cyanate, thiocyanate, fulminate, methanesulfonate and/or amidosulfonate. With particular preference the counteranion is selected from chloride and nitrate. With very particular preference the counteranion is nitrate. Double salts as well can be used as salts of polyvalent metal cations. Double salts are salts which have two or more different cations. An example is alum (KAI(S04)2-12H20), which is suitable as an aluminum salt. The salts of polyvalent metal cations with the aforementioned counteranions are readily water-soluble and hence especially suitable, since relatively high concentrations of the aqueous metal salt solutions (as reactant) can be established. Anionic groups are the deprotonated acid groups present in the polymeric dispersant. Anionogenic groups are the acid groups present in the polymeric dispersant. Groups which are both anionic and anionogenic, such as partially deprotonated polybasic acid residues, are assigned exclusively to the anionic groups when forming the sum of the number of moles of the anionic and anionogenic groups present in the polymeric dispersant. The term “different kinds of polyvalent metal cations” refers to polyvalent metal cations of different elements. Furthermore, the term “different kinds of polyvalent metal cations” also refers to metal cations of the same element with different charge numbers. Anionic and anionogenic groups of the polymeric dispersant are said to be of different kinds when they cannot be converted into one another by protonation.

Any range for formula (a) may be combined with any range for formula (b). A sparingly soluble salt is a salt whose solubility in water under standard conditions of 20°C and atmospheric pressure is less than 5 g/l, preferably less than 1 g/l. A water-soluble salt is a salt whose solubility in water under standard conditions of 20°C and atmospheric pressure is greater than 5 g/l.

The anion is preferably selected from carbonate, silicate, phosphate and aluminate, more preferably the anion is phosphate and more particularly the anion is aluminate. The stated anions also include the polymeric borate, silicate and oxalate anions, and also the polyphosphates. The term “polymeric anions” refers to anions which as well as oxygen atoms comprise at least two atoms from the group consisting of boron, carbon, silicon and phosphorus. With particular preference they are oligomers having a number of atoms of between 2 and 20, more particularly preferably 2 to 14 atoms, most preferably 2 to 5 atoms. The number of atoms in the case of the silicates is more preferably in the range from 2 to 14 silicon atoms, and in the case of the polyphosphates it is more preferably in the range from 2 to 5 phosphorus atoms.

With the silicates it is possible for some of the silicon atoms in the silicates to be replaced by aluminum. Such compounds are known from the class of the aluminosilicates. The fraction of aluminum is preferably less than 10 mol%, based on the sum of silicon and aluminum, and more preferably the aluminum fraction is zero.

It has further proved to be advantageous if the anion is phosphate or aluminate or a mixture thereof and the relation according to formula (b) is in the range from 0.1 to 1.0. It has proved to be particularly advantageous if the anion is phosphate or aluminate or a mixture thereof and the relation according to formula (b) is in the range from 0.2 to 0.75.

The polymeric dispersant preferably meets the requirements of the industrial standard ΕΝ 934-2 (February 2002). The polymeric dispersant comprising the structural units (I) and (II) are prepared in a conventional way, by means of radical polymerization, for example. This is described for example in ΕΡ0894811, ΕΡ1851256, ΕΡ2463314, ΕΡ0753488. In one embodiment the polymeric dispersant is a polycondensation product which comprises the structural units (III) and (IV): (III) Β- (AO), R25 in which Τ is a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl radical, substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl radical or a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic radical having 5 to 10 ring atoms, of which 1 or 2 atoms are heteroatoms selected from Ν, O and S; η is 1 or 2; Β is Ν, ΝΗ or O, with the proviso that η is 2 if Β is Ν and with the proviso that η is 1 if Β is ΝΗ or O; A is CxH2x with χ = 2, 3, 4 or 5, or is CH2CH(C6H5); a is an integer from 1 to 300; R25 is Η, a branched or unbranched Ci to C10 alkyl radical, C5 to C8 cycloalkyl radical, aryl radical, or heteroaryl radical having 5 to 10 ring atoms, of which 1 or 2 atoms are heteroatoms selected from Ν, O and S; where the structural unit (IV) is selected from the structural units (IVa) and (IVb) O D-Ε (AO)b-P-OM ΟΜ (IVa) in which D is a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl radical, substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl radical or a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic radical having 5 to 10 ring atoms, of which 1 or 2 atoms are heteroatoms selected from Ν, O and S; Ε is Ν, ΝΗ or O, with the proviso that η is 2 if Ε is Ν and with the proviso that η is 1 if Ε is ΝΗ or O; A is CxH2x with χ = 2, 3, 4 or 5, or is CH2CH(C6H5); b is an integer from 1 to 300; Μ independently at each occurrence is Η or one cation equivalent; and V-R7 ^ (IVb) in which V is a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl radical, substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl radical and is optionally substituted by 1 or two radicals selected independently of one another from R8, OH, OR8, (CO)R8, COOM, COOR8, S03R8 and N02, preferably OH, OC1-C4 alkyl and CrC4 alkyl; R7 is COOM, OCH2COOM, S03M or 0P03M2; Μ is Η or one cation equivalent; and R8 is CrC4 alkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, phenyl-Ci^ alkyl or CrC4 alkylphenyl. The structural units Τ and D in the general formulae (III) and (IV) in the polycondensation product are preferably derived from phenyl, 2-hydroxyphenyl, 3-hydroxyphenyl, 4-hydroxyphenyl, 2-methoxyphenyl, 3-methoxyphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, naphthyl, 2-hydroxynaphthyl, 4-hydroxynaphthyl, 2-methoxynaphthyl, 4-methoxynaphthyl, phenoxyacetic acid, salicylic acid, preferably from phenyl, where Τ and D may be selected independently of one another and may also each be derived from a mixture of the stated radicals. The groups Β and Ε independently of one another are preferably O. All structural units A may be identical or side chains. In one particularly preferred embodiment, A is C2H4. In the general formula (III), a is preferably an integer from 3 to 200 and more particularly 5 to 150, and in the general formula (IV) b is preferably an integer from 1 to 300, more particularly 1 to 50 and more preferably 1 to 10. Furthermore, the radicals of the general formulae (III) or (IV) may independently of one another in each case possess the same chain length, in which case a and b are each represented by a number. In general it will be useful for, in each case, mixtures with different chain lengths to be present, so that the radicals of the structural units in the polycondensation product have different numerical values for a and, independently, for b. The polycondensation product of the invention frequently has a weight-average molecular weight of 5000 g/mol to 200 000 g/mol, preferably 10 000 to 100 000 g/mol und more preferably 15 000 to 55 000 g/mol. The molar ratio of the structural units (lll):(IV) is typically 4:1 to 1:15 and preferably 2:1 to 1:10. It is advantageous to have a relatively high fraction of structural units (IV) in the polycondensation product, since a relatively high negative charge of the polymers has a good influence on the stability of the aqueous colloidally disperse preparation. The molar ratio of the structural units (IVa):(IVb), when both are present, is typically 1:10 to 10:1 and preferably 1:3 to 3:1. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the polycondensation product comprises a further structural unit (V), which is represented by the formula below: in which R5 is Η, CH3, COOH or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or substituted or unsubstituted different not only within individual polyether side chains but also between different polyether (V) naphthyl; R6 is Η, CH3, COOH or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl. Preferably R5 and R6 are Η or one of the radicals R5 and R6 is Η and the other is CH3. R5 and R6 in structural unit (V) are typically identical or different and are Η, COOH and/or methyl. Very particular preference is given to Η. In another embodiment the molar ratio of the structural units [(III) + (IV)]: (V) in the polycondensate is 2:1 to 1:3. The polycondensates are typically prepared by a process which comprises reacting with one another the compounds forming the basis for the structural units (III), (IV) and (V). The preparation of the polycondensates is for example described in WO 2006/042709 and WO 2010/026155. The monomer with a keto group is preferably an aldehyde or ketone. Examples of monomers of the formula (V) are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, glyoxylic acid and/or benzaldehyde. Formaldehyde is preferred. The polymeric dispersant of the invention may also be present in the form of its salts, such as, for example, the sodium, potassium, organic ammonium, ammonium and/or calcium salt, preferably as the sodium and/or calcium salt. The additives preferably contain 50% to 90% water and 10% to 50% solid, more preferably 55℅-85% water and 15% to 45% solid. The solid here comprises the polymer and also the sparingly soluble salt of the invention The additive of the invention may take the form of an aqueous product in the form of a solution, emulsion or dispersion or in solid form, for example as a powder, after a drying step. The water content of the additive in solid form is in that case preferably less than 10% by weight, more preferably less than 5% by weight. It is also possible for some of the water, preferably up to 10% by weight, to be replaced by organic solvents. Advantageous are alcohols such as ethanol, (iso)propanol and 1-butanol, including its isomers. Acetone can be used as well. By the use of the organic solvents it is possible to influence the solubility and hence the crystallization behavior of the salts of the invention. The additives of the invention are prepared by contacting the water-soluble salt of the polyvalent metal cation and the polymeric dispersant in an aqueous medium, in solid form or in a polymer melt. Preference is given to using a water-soluble salt of the polyvalent metal cation. The salt of the metal cation may be provided in solid form, or else, expediently, as an aqueous solution or suspension. It is therefore possible to add the polyvalent metal cation salt in the form of a powder, an aqueous solution or else an aqueous suspension to an aqueous solution of a dispersant. The compound able to release an anion may likewise be used both in solid form (preparation in situ of a solution, or contacting with the polymer melt) or else preferably in the form of an aqueous solution. An additive of the invention for hydraulically setting compositions may be obtained by precipitating the sparingly soluble salt in the presence of the polymeric dispersant, to give a colloidally disperse preparation of the salt. The precipitation of the sparingly soluble salt here means the formation of colloidally disperse salt particles which are dispersed by the polymeric dispersant and their further coagulation is prevented. Irrespective of whether the salt of the polyvalent metal cation is precipitated in the presence of the polymeric dispersant or whether a freshly precipitated salt of the polyvalent metal cation is dispersed in the presence of the polymeric dispersant, the additive of the invention for hydraulically setting compositions may also be obtained, alternatively, by additionally admixing the preparation with a neutralizing agent as described above. An additive of the invention for hydraulically setting compositions may also be obtained by peptizing a hydroxide and/or oxide of the polyvalent metal cation with an acid, to give a colloidally disperse preparation of the salt of the polyvalent metal cation, in which case the acid is selected preferably from boric acid, carbonic acid, oxalic acid, silicic acid, polyphosphoric acid, phosphoric acid and/or phosphorous acid. The additive is prepared generally by mixing the components, which are preferably in the form of an aqueous solution. In this case it is preferred first to mix the polymeric dispersant (comb polymer) and the polyvalent metal cation salt and then to add the compound able to release the anion which forms a sparingly soluble salt with the polyvalent metal cation. According to another embodiment, the polymeric dispersant (comb polymer) and the compound able to release the anion are mixed first, and then the polyvalent metal cation is added. To adjust the pH it is then possible to add an acid or base. The components are mixed generally at a temperature in the range from 5 to 80°C, usefully 10 to 40°C, and more particularly at room temperature (about 20-30°C). An additive of the invention for hydraulically setting compositions may also be obtained by dispersing a freshly precipitated sparingly soluble salt in the presence of the polymeric dispersant, to give a colloidally disperse preparation of the salt. Freshly precipitated here means immediately subsequent to the precipitation, while the salt is substantially amorphous (no more than 30%, preferably no more than 15% crystallinity); i.e. within about five minutes, preferably within one or two minutes, after the precipitation. Those solids termed “amorphous”, are solids whose atomic building blocks are not arranged in crystal lattices, i.e. do not have a long-range order, but instead only have a more or less pronounced close-range order. While crystalline substances exhibit numerous sharp reflections in the diffraction of x-rays, electron beams and neutron beams, amorphous solids exhibit at most a few diffuse interference rings (halos) at small diffraction angles. The preparation may take place continuously or batchwise. The mixing of the components is accomplished in general in a reactor with a mechanical stirring mechanism. The stirring speed of the stirring mechanism may be between 10 rpm and 2000 rpm. An alternative option is to mix the solutions using a rotor-stator mixer, which may have stirring speeds in the range from 1000 to 30 000 rpm. Furthermore, it is also possible to use different mixing geometries, such as a continuous process in which the solutions are mixed using a Y-mixer, for example. Optionally, a further step in the method may follow, for the drying of the additive of the invention. Drying may be accomplished by roll drying, spray drying, drying in a fluidized bed process, by bulk drying at elevated temperature, or by other customary drying methods. The preferred range of the drying temperature lies between 50 and 230°C. The additive of the invention for hydraulically setting compositions may be used as a slump retainer in water-containing building material mixtures which comprise a hydraulic binder, the hydraulic binder being selected from (Portland) cement, slag sand, flyash, silica dust, metakaolin, natural pozzolans, burnt oil shale, calcium aluminate cement or mixtures of two or more of these components. Additives of the invention can also be prepared by preparing polymeric dispersants with a fraction of polyvalent metal cations > 1 according to formula (a) and mixing them with an alkali-neutralized polymeric dispersant in a ratio so as to obtain a fraction of polyvalent metal cations < 1 according to formula (a). A variety of mixing sequences are possible in this context. Thus the polymeric dispersant with a fraction of polyvalent metal cations > 1 according to formula (a) may be introduced first, and admixed with an alkali-neutralized polymeric dispersant, or vice versa. In this way, furthermore, it is possible to mix different polymeric dispersants. For example, a first alkali-neutralized polymeric dispersant may be mixed with a second polymeric dispersant which has different structural units or a different composition of the structural units from the first polymeric dispersant, and has a fraction of polyvalent metal cations > 1 according to formula (a), to give an additive of the invention. The metering rates of the individual components during the synthesis of the additive of the invention are important parameters. It is particularly preferred for the components to be metered at a high rate. Thus the metering rates typical in the laboratory for the individual components are between 0.01 mL/s and 1000 mL/s. Subject to the proviso of conventional conveying techniques, these parameters can be scaled up to as far as the multi-metric-ton production level, with the upper limit on the metering rate being at least 100 m3/h. The concept of the slump retainer in this application means that the additives, over a processing life of up to 90 minutes, preferably up to 60 minutes, after the mixing of the building material mixture with water, produce a slump of the binder suspension that is as sufficient as possible for the conditions of the application case in question, is extremely high and in particular does not drop substantially over the aforementioned time period. The additives make it possible to set a profile of properties which is tailored to the respective application. Moreover, it is possible to add the additive not only during mortar or concrete production but instead during production of the cement itself. In that case the additive at the same time fulfills the function of a grinding assistant. The concrete additives, in addition to the colloidally disperse preparation of the invention, comprising polymeric plasticizer, polyvalent metal cation and anion of the invention, may also comprise further components. These further components include water-reducing plasticizers such as, for example, lignosulfonate, naphthalenesulfonate condensates, sulfonated melamine resins, or conventional polycarboxylate ethers (other than the abovementioned polycarboxylate ethers), and also defoamers, air entrainers, retarders, shrinkage reducers and/or hardening accelerators. The invention also relates to a building material mixture which comprises at least one additive of the invention and at least one binder. The binder is preferably selected from (Portland) cement, slag sand, flyash, silica dust, metakaolin, natural pozzolans, burnt oil shale, calcium aluminate cement and mixtures thereof. In addition the building material mixture may comprise customary constituents, such as curing accelerators, curing retarders, clay modifiers, shrinkage reducers, corrosion inhibitors, strength enhancers, water reducers, etc. The addition of additive of the invention amounts in general to 0.1% to 4% by weight as a solid, based on the cement content of the building material mixture. It may be added as an aqueous colloidally disperse preparation or as a dried solid, in the form of a powder, for example. Examples Gel permeation chromatography The sample preparation for the determination of molar weights took place by dissolving the polymer solution in the GPC eluent, to give a polymer concentration in the GPC eluent of 0.5% by weight. Thereafter this solution was filtered through a syringe filter with polyethersulfone membrane and a pore size of 0.45 pm. The injection volume of this filtrate was 50-100 pi. The average molecular weights were determined on a GPC instrument from Waters with the model name Alliance 2690, with a UV detector (Waters 2487) and an Rl detector (Waters 2410). Columns: Shodex SB-G Guard Column for SB-800 HQ series Shodex OHpak SB 804HQ and 802.5HQ (ΡΗΜ gel, 8 χ 300 mm, pH 4.0 to 7.5) Eluent: 0.05 Μ aqueous ammonium formate/methanol mixture = 80:20 (parts by volume) Flow rate: 0.5 ml/min Temperature: 50°C Injection: 50 to 100 pi Detection: Rl and UV The molecular weights of the polymers were determined with two different calibrations. Determination took place first of all relative to polyethylene glycol standards from the company PSS Polymer Standards Service GmbH. The molecular weight distribution curves of the polyethylene glycol standards were determined by means of light scattering. The masses of the polyethylene glycol standards were 682 000, 164 000, 114 000, 57 100, 40 000, 26 100, 22 100, 12 300, 6 240, 3 120, 2 010, 970, 430, 194, 106 g/mol. Polymer synthesis The polymeric dispersant Ρ1 is based on the monomers maleic acid, acrylic acid and vinyloxybutylpolyethylene glycol - 5800. The molar ratio of acrylic acid to maleic acid is 7. Mw = 40 000 g/mol (determined by GPC). The solids content is 45% by weight. The synthesis of the comb polymer Ρ1 is described in WO 2010/066470 at page 10 line 1 to line 38. The polymeric dispersant Ρ2 is a condensate of the building blocks PhenolPEG5000 and phenoxyethanol phosphate. The molecular weight is 23 000 g/mol. The synthesis is described in DE102004050395. The solids content is 31%. Phosphoric ester-containing polymeric dispersant Ρ3 A glass reactor equipped with stirrer, thermometer, pH electrode and a number of feed ports was charged with 180 g deionized water, and this initial charge was heated to a polymerization starting temperature of 80°C. In a separate feed vessel, 4669 g (240 mmol) of a 25.7% strength aqueous methylpolyethylene glycol (5000) methacrylic ester solution were mixed with 251.8 g (1198 mmol) of hydroxyethyl methacrylate phosphoric ester (ΗΕΜΑ phosphate) and 190.2 g of a 20% strength NaOH solution (corresponding to solution A). In a further separate feed vessel, 13.71 g of sodium peroxodisulfate were mixed with 182.1 g of water (solution Β). In a third feed, a 25% strength solution was prepared with 13.2 g of 2-mercaptoethanol and 39.6 g of deionized water (solution C). Following the preparation of solutions A, Β and C, the addition of all three solutions to the stirred initial charge was commenced simultaneously. All of the additions were fed linearly into the initial charge over a period of 60 minutes. After the end of the addition, the temperature was held at 80°C for a further 30 minutes, after which the solution was cooled and was neutralized to a pH of 7.3 using 158 g of 50% strength aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The resulting copolymer was obtained as a clear solution, which had a solids content of 27.8%. The average molecular weight of the copolymer was Mw 39 000 g/mol and Μρ 34 000 g/mol, and the polydispersity was 1.55. The ΗΕΜΑ phosphate used is prepared by mixing polyphosphoric acid with ΗΕΜΑ, the mixture being of 156 g of ΗΕΜΑ and 141.6 g of polyphosphoric acid. This means that the fraction of the pure ΗΕΜΑ phosphate in the reaction mixture is 251.8 g.

Mixing was carried out in a 1 I jacketed glass reactor with paddle stirrer, temperature-conditioned at 20°C, at 300 rpm. The sequence of the addition is indicated in table 2 by a letter code. Ρ stands for the aqueous solution of the polymeric dispersant, Κ for the inventive salt of the polyvalent metal cation, A for the compound of the invention able to release an anion, and Β and S for base and acid, respectively. The amounts are always based on the net contents. The final pH of the resulting solutions or suspensions is likewise indicated. The solution of the polymeric dispersant is charged to a beaker with magnetic stirrer, and dilution takes place with the stated mass of water (see table 2). Subsequently the salt of the invention of the polyvalent metal cation (for amounts see table) was added and was dissolved with stirring at about 200 rpm, using a magnetic stirrer bar. The compound able to release the anion was added with stirring. Adjustment of the pH, to a pH of 7, takes place optionally, using a base. Viscous suspensions were formed in this procedure. The suspensions are stable on storage. Samples of example 12 and example 13 were stored for 6 months each at 20°C and 4°C, and under atmospheric pressure. In this trial the additives proved to be stable with respect to phase separation and retained their activity as slump retainers. General instructions: spray drying The additives of the invention can be converted into powder form by spray drying. In that case the aqueous solutions or suspensions of the additives of the invention are dried using a Mobil Minor spray dryer (from GEA Niro) at an entry temperature of 230°C and an exit temperature of 80°C. For this purpose the aqueous solutions are first admixed with 1% by weight (based on the solids content of the aqueous solution) of a mixture of Additin RC 7135 LD (Rhein Chemie GmbH) and MPEG500 (50% by weight in each case). The powders obtained are admixed with 1% by weight of finely divided silica (Ν20Ρ, Wacker Chemie AG), ground using a Retsch Grindomix RM 200 mill at 8000 rpm for 10 seconds and filtered through a 500 pm sieve. 2: Composition of the additives No. Polymer Metal salt Anion Base /acid pH Sequence Water Polyme Metal Anionc Base/ comp.

The grading curve set corresponds to the Α/Β 16 classification according to DIN 1045-2. The cements used were Karlstadt CEM I 42.5 R, with a w/c value of 0.47, and Bernburg CEM I 42.5 R, with a w/c of 0.44. Prior to testing in the concrete, the polymer samples were defoamed with 1% by weight of triisobutyl phosphate, based on the polymer solids content. Mixing process The dried aggregates as per grading curve, and the cement, were introduced into a forced mixer and mixed for 10 seconds. The mixture in the forced mixer was thereafter moistened with 10% of the total water, and mixing was continued for a further 2 minutes. Then the remainder of the water was added, and mixing was continued for 1 minute more. Lastly the additive was added, followed by mixing for 1 minute again. The slump value is a measure of the extent to which the concrete cake collapses after the metal cone is lifted (difference in height between the top edge of the metal cone and the height of the concrete cake after removal of the metal mold). The slump flow corresponds to the base diameter of the concrete cake after collapse. The spread is obtained by shaking the slump flow board, in accordance with the abovementioned DIN method, by raising and impacting 15 times. The shearing forces which occur as a result of the tapping produce a further spread of the concrete. The diameter of the concrete cake after tapping is identified as the spread. The levels of addition indicated (Dos. %) are based on the solids content of the additives employed. Table 3: Results of the concrete tests, cement: Bernburg CEM I 42.5 R, w/c = 0.44 Ex.

The weight ratio of sand to cement was 2.2 to 1. A mixture of 70% by weight standard sand (Normensand GmbH, D-59247 Beckum) and 30% by weight silica sand was used. Prior to testing in the mortar, the additive samples were defoamed with 1% by weight of triisobutyl phosphate, based on the polymer solids content. Mixing process Cement is added to the initial charge of water. This defines the time point 0s. Stirring is then carried out on setting 1 for 30 s. After that the sand is added and stirring continues for a further 30 s at setting 1 (140 rpm) and a further 30 s at setting 2 (285 rpm). The stirring is then discontinued for 90 s. In this time interval the plasticizer (either as an aqueous preparation or as a powder) is added. If the aqueous plasticizer preparation is added, then the added water is subjected accordingly from the amount of the batching water. Lastly, stirring takes place again on setting 2 for 60 s. After a total mixing time which is therefore 4 minutes, the first spread is ascertained. The spread was obtained by shaking the slump flow table, in accordance with the abovementioned DIN method, by raising and impacting it 15 times (tapping). The diameter of the mortar cake after tapping is identified as the spread. Delta identifies the difference in the spread with inventive additive relative to the spread in a comparative mortar test. In comparative mortar tests, the polymeric dispersant present in the additive of the invention was used as additive in each case. The levels of addition indicated are based on the solids content of the polymer suspensions employed. 4: Mortar results, Karlstadt cement, w/c 0.44 Additive No. Basis polymer Dos.
