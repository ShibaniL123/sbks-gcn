TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel dextrin fatty acid ester prepared by esterification between dextrin and particular fatty acids, and uses thereof. Particularly, the present invention relates to novel dextrin fatty acid ester that does not cause gelation of liquid oil. BACKGROUND ART Various types of resins have been used in cosmetics. A large number of products have been developed by using shape-retaining ability brought about by the adhesion (tackiness) and hardness of these resins. Resins are broadly classified into: naturally-derived resins whose starting materials are natural plant-derived resins, for example, pine resin, dammar, mastic, copal, amber, balsam, and Japanese lacquer or natural animal-derived resins, for example, shellac; and synthetic resins synthesized from chemicals with petroleum as a material. Particularly, the natural plant-derived resins are used in not only cosmetics but also in foods such as chewing gum. For example, rosin acid pentaerythritol ester is a naturally-derived resin prepared by esterification between abietic acid contained in a solid resin called rosin (obtained from the secretory fluid of pine) and pentaerythritol (natural sugar alcohol) (see patent document 1), and is also currently used in general in cosmetics and foods. Unfortunately, this resin, in cosmetics, often presents an odor problem, which tends to be made more noticeable by heating for dissolution. In addition, its film has a little adhesion and thus requires adding a plasticizer for adjustment. In some cases, the resin contained therein in large amounts may impair the texture of the cosmetic. Alternatively, for example, a silicone resin has been used as a synthetic resin (see patent document 2). Although this resin is free from problems associated with safety, odor, or texture, it may be difficult, particularly, for cosmetics, to impart the affinity of the film for the skin due to its poor adhesion to the skin. Thus, attention has been focused on naturally-derived dextrin fatty acid ester. However, some conventional dextrin fatty acid esters (patent document 3), which are prepared by esterification of branched fatty acids, cause gelation of liquid oil, but have insufficient adhesion (tackiness).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a diagram showing the IR chart of dextrin fatty acid ester of Production Example 1. MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The present invention will be described in more detail. (Dextrin Fatty Acid Ester) Dextrin fatty acid ester of the present invention is prepared by esterification between dextrin and fatty acids. The degree of substitution of the dextrin by the fatty acids is 1.0 to 3.0, preferably 1.2 to 2.8, per glucose unit. This degree of substitution less than 1.0 is not preferable because the resulting dextrin fatty acid ester requires a temperature as high as 100° C. or higher for its dissolution in liquid oil or the like and produces stains or unusual odors. The dextrin fatty acid ester of the present invention has the following properties: 1) The dextrin fatty acid ester of the present invention does not cause gelation of liquid oil when mixed with the liquid oil. The phrase “not cause gelation of liquid oil” means that, when liquid paraffin having a kinematic viscosity at 40° C. of 8 mm2/s as measured by ASTM D445 test method is used as the liquid oil, the liquid paraffin containing 5% by mass of the dextrin fatty acid ester of the present invention is dissolved at 100° C. and measured 24 hours later to have a viscosity equal to or lower than the detection limit in viscosity measurement at 25° C. using Yamco DIGITAL VISCOMATE viscometer VM-100A (oscillatory) (manufactured by Yamaichi Electronics Co., Ltd.). It can be confirmed that viscosity is detected if the gelation of the liquid oil is caused. 2) A film formed from the dextrin fatty acid ester of the present invention has tackiness in a particular range. The “tackiness” may be indicated by change in load (maximum stress value) applied to the point of contact from the start of retrograde movement to complete separation when the dextrin fatty acid ester is applied to a support, with which another support is surface-contacted from a position some distance therefrom and then separated therefrom by the retrograde movement. Thus, the change in load, i.e., the tackiness, is 30 to 1000 g when 100 g of load is applied to a film using a texture analyzer, for example, Texture Analyzer TA.XTplus (manufactured by Stable Micro Systems Ltd.) and a probe made of a cylindrical polyacetal resin of 12.5 mm in diameter (Delrin (registered trademark) manufactured by DuPont), kept for 10 seconds, and then separated therefrom at a rate of 0.5 mm/second, wherein the film has been obtained by applying a light liquid isoparaffin solution containing 40% by mass of the dextrin fatty acid ester at a thickness of 400 μm on a glass plate using an applicator, followed by drying. The dextrin used in the dextrin fatty acid ester of the present invention is preferably dextrin having an average degree of glucose polymerization of 3 to 150, particularly, 10 to 100. If the average degree of glucose polymerization is 2 or less, the resulting dextrin ester is in a wax-like form having reduced solubility in an oil solution. Alternatively, if the average degree of glucose polymerization exceeds 150, the resulting dextrin ester, for example, may disadvantageously require a higher temperature for its dissolution in an oil solution or have poor solubility. The dextrin may have any of linear, branched, and cyclic sugar chains. The fatty acids used in the dextrin fatty acid ester of the present invention inevitably comprise one or more saturated branched fatty acids having 4 to 26 carbon atoms and may further comprise one or more fatty acids selected from the group consisting of saturated linear fatty acids having 2 to 22 carbon atoms, unsaturated linear or branched fatty acids having 6 to 30 carbon atoms, and saturated or unsaturated cyclic fatty acids having 6 to 30 carbon atoms (hereinafter, these fatty acids other than the saturated branched fatty acids having 4 to 26 carbon atoms are also collectively referred to as “the other fatty acids”). The compositional ratios of the fatty acids in the present invention are more than 50 mol % and 100 mol % or less, preferably 55 mol % or more and 100 mol % or less, based on the total amount of the fatty acids, of one or more saturated branched fatty acids having 4 to 26 carbon atoms and 0 mol % or more and less than 50 mol %, preferably 0 mol % or more and 45 mol % or less, based on the total amount of the fatty acids, of the other fatty acids. Examples of the saturated branched fatty acids having 4 to 26 carbon atoms, used in the present invention, include isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, 2-ethylbutyric acid, ethylmethylacetic acid, isoheptanoic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, isononanoic acid, isodecanoic acid, isotridecanoic acid, isomyristic acid, isopalmitic acid, isostearic acid, isoarachic acid, and isohexacosanoic acid. One or more of these fatty acids can be selected or combined appropriately for use. Of them, fatty acids having 12 to 22 carbon atoms are preferable, and isostearic acid is particularly preferable, with no limitation imposed on structural difference, etc. In the present invention, the isostearic acid means one branched stearic acid or a mixture of two or more branched stearic acids. For example, 5,7,7-trimethyl-2-(1,3,3-trimethylbutyl)-octanoic acid can be produced by converting an isobutylene dimer to branched aldehyde having 9 carbon atoms through oxo reaction and subsequently this aldehyde to unsaturated branched aldehyde having 18 carbon atoms through aldol condensation, followed by hydrogenation and oxidation (hereinafter, abbreviated to “aldol condensation type”). This is commercially available from, for example, Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd. 2-heptylundecanoic acid can be produced by Guerbet reaction with nonyl alcohol, followed by oxidation. This is commercially available from, for example, Mitsubishi Kasei Corp. An analogous mixture slightly differing in branch position therefrom is commercially available from Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd. In addition, a type that is produced from a starting alcohol other than a saturated linear alcohol and methyl-branched at two positions is also commercially available from Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd. (hereinafter, collectively abbreviated to “Guerbet reaction type”). Furthermore, methyl-branched isostearic acid is obtained as a by-product during, for example, oleic acid dimer production [described in, e.g., J. Amer. Oil Chem. Soc., 51, 522 (1974)] and is commercially available from, for example, Emery Industries, Inc., USA (hereinafter, abbreviated to “Emery type”). A starting material for dimer acid serving as a starting material for Emery-type isostearic acid may comprise not only oleic acid but also linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and the like. In the present invention, this Emery type is particularly preferable. Examples of the saturated linear fatty acids having 2 to 22 carbon atoms, used in the present invention, include acetic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachic acid, and behenic acid.

(Method for Producing Dextrin Fatty Acid Ester) Next, a method for producing the dextrin fatty acid ester of the present invention will be described. A production method known in the art can be adopted without particular limitations in the present invention. For example, the dextrin fatty acid ester of the present invention can be produced as follows: 1) Dextrin having an average degree of glucose polymerization of 3 to 150 is reacted with fatty acid derivatives comprising more than 50 mol % and 100 mol % or less, based on the total amount of the fatty acid derivatives, of one or more saturated branched fatty acid derivatives having 4 to 26 carbon atoms and 0 mol % or more and less than 50 mol %, based on the total amount of the fatty acid derivatives, of one or more fatty acids selected from the group consisting of saturated linear fatty acid derivatives having 2 to 22 carbon atoms, unsaturated linear or branched fatty acid derivatives having 6 to 30 carbon atoms, and saturated or unsaturated cyclic fatty acid derivatives having 6 to 30 carbon atoms (hereinafter, these fatty acid derivatives are collectively referred to as “the other fatty acid derivatives”). 2) Dextrin having an average degree of glucose polymerization of 3 to 150 is reacted with one or more saturated branched fatty acid derivatives having 4 to 26 carbon atoms, and subsequently, the product is reacted with the other fatty acid derivatives, wherein the one or more saturated branched fatty acid derivatives having 4 to 26 carbon atoms are used in an amount of more than 50 mol % and 100 mol % or less based on the total amount of the fatty acid derivatives, and the other fatty acid derivatives are used in an amount of 0 mol % or more and less than 50 mol % based on the total amount of the fatty acid derivatives. In the present invention, for example, halides, acid anhydrides, or the like of the fatty acids described above are used as the fatty acid derivatives used in the esterification reaction with the dextrin. In any of the cases 1) and 2), first, the dextrin is dispersed in a reaction solvent, and a catalyst is added thereto, if necessary. This mixture is reacted by the addition of halides, acid anhydrides, or the like of the fatty acids described above. In the production method 1), these acids are mixed and simultaneously added thereto for the reaction. In the production method 2), the saturated branched fatty acid derivatives, which are lower reactive, are first reacted therewith, and subsequently, the other fatty acid derivatives are added and reacted with the product. Of them, a preferable method can be adopted for the production. For example, a formamide (e.g., dimethylformamide and formamide), acetamide, ketone, aromatic compound (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylene), or dioxane solvent can be used appropriately as the reaction solvent. A tertiary amino compound such as pyridine or picoline can be used as the reaction catalyst.
