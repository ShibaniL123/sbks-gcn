PACKAGE HAVING A LINE OF WEAKNESS FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a package, wherein present in the package is a wrapped feminine hygiene article. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Producers of feminine hygiene articles attempt to satisfy a consumer’s expectations at several levels. One such level is at the store shelf where a consumer expects to make a purchase quickly. However, the consumer often faces a multitude of choices as to which feminine hygiene article to purchase. As such, packages containing feminine hygiene articles are often used to help a consumer make a purchasing decision. For instance, a package may have distinctive markings or coloration to attract the consumer’s attention to the feminine hygiene articles contained therein. A package is successful if it can attract the consumer’s attention, and distinguish itself from the competitors around it, such that the consumer will purchase it. In addition to a package distinguishing itself from other packages, a package should convey to consumers information about the feminine hygiene article they contain. For instance, often a feminine hygiene article will be disposed in a wrapper. The wrapper serves to not only isolate and protect the feminine hygiene article, but may also have distinct features of its own. To communicate such features of a wrapper to consumers a number of methods may be used. For example, packages containing wrapped feminine hygiene articles may have information about the wrapper printed on them in the form of words, pictures, or symbols. Other packages use windows to allow a consumer to view the wrapped feminine hygiene articles contained therein. Windows though are often inadequate for properly displaying a wrapper’s line of weakness, as a line of weakness usually extends substantially or completely around the periphery of a wrapper. And a window is only capable of displaying a single perspective of a wrapped feminine hygiene article. However, the functional features of a package have mostly been ignored as a means to communicate information about the wrapper containing a feminine hygiene article. As such, it would be desirable to provide a package that communicates information about a feminine hygiene wrapper to a consumer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A package is provided which comprises at least one wall defining an exterior surface having a periphery and an interior space of the package, wherein the package comprises a line of weakness having one or more properties. The package contains within the interior space at least one feminine hygiene article. The feminine hygiene article is disposed in a wrapper having a periphery and comprising a line of weakness having one or more properties, wherein the package line of weakness has the same or similar properties as the wrapper line of weakness. A package is provided which comprises at least one wall defining an exterior surface having a periphery and an interior space of the package, wherein the package comprises a line of weakness having a length that extends less than the entire periphery of the exterior surface. The package contains within the interior space at least one feminine hygiene article disposed in a wrapper having a periphery and comprising a line of weakness having a length that extends less than the entire periphery. The package has an after open appearance comprising a hood and a hinge and the wrapper has an after open appearance comprising a hood and a hinge. A method of communicating to a consumer properties of a line of weakness on a wrapper of a feminine hygiene article is provided. The method comprises providing a package comprising at least one wall defining an exterior surface having a periphery and an interior space of the package, wherein the package comprises a line of weakness having properties. The method further comprises providing at least one feminine hygiene article contained within the interior space of the package, wherein the feminine hygiene article is disposed in a wrapper comprising a line of weakness having properties. The package communicates to a consumer the properties of the wrapper line of weakness, by having the properties of the package line of weakness the same or similar to the properties of the wrapper line of weakness. The method may further include the steps of opening the package along the line of weakness such that after opening the package comprises a hood and a hinge, and opening the wrapper along the line of weakness such that after opening the wrapper comprises a hood and a hinge.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a package containing one or more individually wrapped feminine hygiene articles. The package and the wrapper of a feminine hygiene article each have a line of weakness. The line of weakness facilitates the opening of the package or wrapper by providing a weakened tear point. The line of weakness present on the package communicates to a consumer one or more of the properties of a line of weakness present on a wrapper, because the line of weakness on the package has the same or similar properties as the wrapper’s line of weakness. For example, the line of weakness on the package may have the same or similar length, pattern, number, location, or after open appearance, as the wrapper’s line of weakness. This allows the package to communicate to a consumer, at the store shelf, the properties of the wrapper’s line of weakness without the consumer actually having to open the package to view the wrapper. The package’s communication to a consumer at the store shelf allows the consumer to select the wrapper that is most convenient for them to use. For instance, some consumers might prefer a wrapper that when opened separates into two separate pieces for easy disposal, or a wrapper that when completely opened remains one piece to store and dispose of used feminine hygiene articles. As used herein, the term “feminine hygiene article” refers to articles such as, disposable absorbent articles that can be worn by women for menstrual or incontinence control, such as sanitary napkins, tampons, pessaries, interlabial products, incontinence articles, and pantiliners. As used herein, a feminine hygiene article can include any associated applicator that typically can be associated with the feminine hygiene article. For example, a feminine hygiene article can be a tampon that may or may not include an applicator to facilitate insertion of a tampon into the vaginal canal or other body cavity. As used herein, the term “tampon” refers to any type of absorbent structure that can be inserted into the vaginal canal or other body cavity for the purpose of anyone or more of the following such as absorbing fluid, aiding in wound healing, or for delivering materials, such as moisture or active materials such as medicaments. A tampon can include any known tampon configuration, for example, digital tampons, tampons with traditional plunger type applicators, or tampons with compact applicators, such as those described in U.S. Patents 4,726,805; 4,846,802; 4,960,417; 5,087,239; 5,279,541; 6,258,075; 6,478,763; or any other known tampon. As used herein, the term “line of weakness” refers to one or more weakness points arranged in any pattern suitable to facilitate the opening of a package or wrapper by providing a weakened tear point. The pattern can extend in one or more directions, for example the pattern can be straight, bent, angled, curved, irregular or combinations thereof. One or more of the individual weakness points can overlap to form a line of weakness. In addition, or alternatively, one or more of the individual weakness points can be spaced apart from one another to form a line of weakness. A line of weakness can be formed in any suitable manner, such as mechanically, thermally, using a laser, chemically, or combinations thereof. As used herein the term “properties of a line of weakness” refers to the appearance of a package’s or wrapper’s line of weakness, and may include a line of weakness’s length, pattern, number, location, after open appearance or combinations thereof. As used herein, the term “weakness point” refers to a region of the package or wrapper material where the thickness of the package or wrapper material is substantially less than the thickness of the package or wrapper material surrounding the region. In certain embodiments, an individual weakness point can be weaker than the surrounding area, for example about 50% weaker, about 75% weaker, or about 100% weaker. Weakness points can be formed in any suitable manner, such as by depressions or perforations. As used herein, the term “depression” refers to a weakness point having a thickness less than the thickness of the surrounding package or wrapper material but greater than zero. The depressions can extend into the package or wrapper material from the inner surface, outer surface or both of the package or wrapper material. In certain embodiments, individual depressions can overlap each other when forming a line of weakness, so that a substantially continuous line of weakness formed by depressions is generated, such as a score line or groove. As used herein, the term “perforation” refers to one or more weakness points, wherein at least a portion of the region of the package or wrapper material forming the weakness point can have a thickness of about zero. FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of the present invention wherein a package 20 contains a feminine hygiene article disposed within a wrapper 40. The package 20, as shown in FIG. 1, may be a box having one or more walls 22 that define an interior storage space 27 for storing one or more feminine hygiene articles individually disposed within a wrapper 40. Each wall 22 has an interior surface, which forms the interior storage space 27 and an exterior surface, which forms the exterior surface 24 of the package 20, wherein the exterior surface 24 has a periphery. In addition, a line of weakness 28 is present on at least one wall 22 of the package 20, and a line of weakness 42 is present on the wrapper 40. Further, the package 20 may be of any suitable shape, such that a line of weakness 28 present on the package 20 can communicate to a consumer the properties of the line of weakness 42 of the wrapper. A wall 22 of the package 20 may be composed of different materials or may be composed of substantially the same type of material. A wall 22 may be a laminate of materials, such as paper, plastic or both. In certain embodiments, the package can comprise inflexible materials, such as cardboard, paperboard, cartonboard, chipboard, plywood, SBS, metal, plastic, paper, card stock, fabric, ceramic, polymer, natural fibers, synthetic fibers, webs, mesh, screen, wood, composite, combinations thereof, or any other suitable material. Alternatively, or in addition, the package can be made of a flexible material, such as, blown or cast film in a blend of low density polyethylene and linear low density polyethylene, metallocenes, ethylene vinyl acetate, surlyn, polyethylene terephthalate, biaxally oriented polypropylene, nylon, combinations thereof, or any other suitable material. The package 20 can include at least one window 26, such as, a region of transparency. As used herein, “transparency” means having the property of transmitting light without substantial scattering so that items contained within the interior storage space 27 of a package 20 can be visible to a consumer. The window 26 can comprise a transparent covering, such as, for example, a transparent film. In addition, or alternatively, the window 26 can comprise an opening in the package 20 that does not include a covering. In certain embodiments, the window 26 can comprise a transparent covering that can be anyone or more of the following, such as clear, translucent, tinted, or opaque. The transparent covering can be tinted in any suitable color or combination of colors. The transparent covering can also, or alternatively, be printed, embossed or both. In certain embodiments, the window 26 can be an image that depicts or gives the perception of a window, such as an image that depicts a region of transparency or an opening. The window 26 can be disposed on at least one wall 22 of the package, such as the front wall, the back wall, or side walls. The window 26 can be at any location on a wall 22 and can comprise any suitable amount of a wall 22, for example from about 5% to about 95% of the wall, such as, for example, about 5% to about 75%, about 5% to about 50%, about 5% to about 25%, or any other amount of the wall. In certain embodiments, feminine hygiene articles having a wrapper can be positioned adjacent the window such that at least a portion of the wrapper can be visible through the window. FIG. 2 shows a side view of the package 20 of FIG. 1 containing a wrapper 40 having a feminine hygiene article disposed therein, in this instance a tampon 50. The wrapper 40 has a length L, a width W, a top 44, a bottom 46, an outer surface 48 having a periphery, and a line of weakness 42. Any wrapped feminine hygiene article or combination of wrapped feminine hygiene articles can be contained in a package. The feminine hygiene articles are individually wrapped prior to being contained within a package. In certain embodiments, a package can contain a single wrapped feminine hygiene article. The material of the wrapper can comprise one or more materials listed below, such as flexible polymeric films, for instance, polymeric films made of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, cellophane, polyamide, polyvinyl chloride, or ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer; heatshrinkable films; stretch films; pre-stretched elastic material, such as wrapper material that comprises polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, or polyvinyl chloride; polystyrene; polyethylene-terephtalate (PET); metallic foils, such as aluminum foil; non-occlusive or porous materials such as nonwovens, wovens, scrims, meshes and papers, or combinations thereof. Non-occlusive materials can be made occlusive such as by lamination with or by coating with occlusive material. In the case of cellulosic papers, examples include lamination with a polymeric film such as a polyolefinic composition or coating or impregnation of the paper with wax. In certain embodiments, wrapper materials can be coated with various chemical compounds to improve their barrier properties or the ability for sealing. In addition, the wrapper material can have a low flexural modulus. The low flexural modulus provides for a low noise wrapper during transport, as well as during handling and opening of the wrapper. Further, in certain embodiments, the material of the wrapper may be the same as the material of the package. In certain other embodiments, the material of the wrapper may differ from the material of the package. In certain embodiments, the wrapper can be constructed of one connected piece of wrapper material. In certain other embodiments, the wrapper may be constructed from multiple pieces of wrapper material, sufficiently joined together, such that wrapper material substantially acts as one connected piece of wrapper material. In certain embodiments, the wrapper can be formed by closing the wrapper material via heat-sealing onto itself after wrapping the article. In addition, the wrapper can be bonded or sealed by being glued, embossed, crimped, sewed, stitched, entangled, mechanically interlocked, cold pressure welded, ultrasonic bonded, or combinations thereof. A wrapper can be any suitable color. In certain embodiments, a wrapper can include one or more colors that correspond to a feature of the feminine hygiene article contained therein, such as absorbency, size, scent, lotion, or other features. For example, the feminine hygiene article can be a tampon and the wrapper can include one or more colors that correspond to the absorbency of the tampon. In certain embodiments, the wrapper can include one or more indicia to provide a visual indication of the location of a line of weakness present on a wrapper. The indicia can be any indicia suitable for providing a visual indication, such as, color, opacity, embossment, texture, or other suitable indicia. In certain embodiments, the indicia can be one or more colors suitable for indicating the location of a line of weakness, such as any one or more colors that are darker than, lighter than, or contrasting to one or more of the colors of the wrapper. The indicia can be one or more colors. The indicia can be present at any location on a wrapper suitable for indicating the location of a line of weakness, such as at a location near to or corresponding to the location of a line of weakness. In certain embodiments, a wrapper can include an opening aid, such as a means for making it easier for a user to open the wrapper. The opening aid can assist a user in removing a feminine hygiene article from the wrapper, by providing a means for the user to grip the wrapper to break the one or more lines of weakness. The opening aid can be any suitable means, such as one or more tabs, flaps, rings, caps, plates, curved plates, sticks, discs, asymmetrical structures, meshes, screens, flared stmctures, molded parts, cut or stamped sheet, or any other suitable opening aid, such as, opening aids described in U.S. Patent 6,955,665. Referring back to FIG. 2, the opening aid can be at any one or more suitable locations on the wrapper 40, such as, the top 44 of the wrapper 40, one or more sides of the wrapper 40, or the bottom 46 of the wrapper 40. In certain embodiments, the one or more tabs can be formed from a portion of a wrapper. Alternatively, or in addition, the one or more tabs can extend from the outer surface of the wrapper, such as a portion of wrapper protmding from the wrapper. A tab can be any suitable size. In certain embodiments, a tab will be sufficiently large to be reliably grasped by the user, such as handle or finger grip. In certain embodiments, a tab can be stiffened by heat sealing, or embossing with or without the addition of heat. In certain embodiments, the tab can also function as a seal. The package and wrapper can have one or more lines of weakness. A line of weakness can be located at any suitable location on the package or wrapper. For instance, as shown in FIG. 2,the lines of weakness 28, 42 can be located near the top 29 of the package 20 or top 44 of the wrapper 40. As used herein, the “top of the wrapper” means the portion of the wrapper nearest to or which covers the end of the feminine hygiene article that should be removed first from the wrapper. For example, when the feminine hygiene article is a tampon with an applicator, the top of the wrapper can be the portion of the wrapper nearest to or which covers the portion of the applicator nearest the insertion end. In certain embodiments, a line of weakness can be located in, for example, the upper half of the wrapper, the upper third of the wrapper, the upper fourth of the wrapper, the upper fifth of the wrapper, the upper sixth of the wrapper, or any other suitable location on the wrapper. As used herein, the “top of the package” refers to the end portion of the package that is opposite the surface upon which the package would normally be displayed at the store shelf. For example, in certain embodiments the top of the package is the portion of the package having the line of weakness to allow a user to access the wrapped feminine hygiene articles contained therein. In certain embodiments, a line of weakness can be located in, for example, the upper half of the package, the upper third of the package, the upper fourth of the package, the upper fifth of the package, the upper sixth of the package, or any other suitable location on the package. In certain embodiments, as shown in FIG. 3 a line of weakness 28, 42 can go around the entire periphery of the package 20 or wrapper 40, such that when the package 20 or wrapper 40 is completely opened, the package 20 or wrapper 40 comprises two or more unconnected portions. In certain other embodiments, referring back to FIG. 1, a line of weakness 42 can encompass any amount of the periphery of the package 20 or wrapper 40 suitable to allow the package 20 or wrapper 40 to remain in one piece after the package 20 or wrapper 40 is fully opened. For instance, a line of weakness can extend across less than the entire periphery of a package or wrapper, for example less than about 95%, less than about 90%, less than about 85%, less than about 80%, less than about 75%, less than about 70%, less than about 65%, less than about 60%, less than about 55%, less than about 50%, less than about 45%, less than about 40%, or any other suitable amount of the periphery. A line of weakness can extend a sufficient length along a package or wrapper to create an opening that is sufficiently large to allow a wrapped feminine hygiene article to be removed from a package, or a feminine hygiene article from a wrapper. A line of weakness can be provided in any suitable pattern. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, a line of weakness 28 can extend across the package 20, so as to be in a parallel direction with respect to one or more edges 25 of a package 20. Wherein an edge 25 of a package 20 is formed when two walls 22 intersect, for example each wall 22 of a package 20 that has a box shape will have four edges 25. Further, a line of weakness 42 can be provided across the wrapper 40, for example in a transverse direction with respect to the length L of the wrapper 40. As shown in FIG. 5, a line of weakness 28, 42 can extend in an angled direction with respect to an edge 25 of a package 20 or longitudinal axis LA of a wrapper 40. Any suitable angle can be used, for a line of weakness 28, 42 on a package 20 or wrapper 40. For example, as shown in FIG. 5, an angle for a line of weakness 28 originating from on an edge 25 of a package 20 can have an upward angle from the edge 25 towards the top 29 of the package 20. As further shown, a line of weakness 42 located on a wrapper 40 may have an angle, such as an angle upward from the initiation point 45 of the line of weakness 42 toward the top 44 of the wrapper 40. In addition, as shown in FIG. 6 an angle for a line of weakness 28 originating from on an edge 25 of a package 20 can have a downward angle from the edge 25 towards the bottom 35 of the package 20, and a line of weakness 42 located on a wrapper 40 may have an angle downward from the initiation point 45 of the line of weakness 42 toward the bottom 46 of the wrapper 40. As shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 a line of weakness 28 originating from an edge 25 of a package 20 may have an angle T1 respective to the edge 25 of from about 5° to about 175 °, such as, for example from about 45 ° to about 145 °, such as, for example about 75 ° to about 125 °. A line of weakness 42 originating from an initiation point 45 may have an angle T2 respective to the longitudinal axis LA of from about 5° to about 175 °, such as, for example from about 45 ° to about 145 °, such as, for example about 75 ° to about 125 °. FIG. 7 shows that in certain embodiments, when a package 20 and wrapper 40 have a similar line of weakness 28, 42, after the line of weakness 28, 42 is separated during the opening of the package 20 and wrapper 40, the after opening appearance of the package 20 and wrapper 40 may also be similar. As the top 29 of the package 20 or the top 44 of the wrapper 40 is separated from the other portion of the package 20 or wrapper 40 along the line of weakness 28, 42 a hood 33, 63 is formed which is attached to the rest of the package 20 or wrapper 40 by a hinge 31, 61. The formation of a hood 33, 63 and hinge 31,61 after opening the package 20 and wrapper 40 gives the package 20 and wrapper 40 the same or similar appearance. Further, as shown in Figure 7, in this embodiment the wrapper 40 can remain in one piece after opening. The wrapper 40 can then be used to store a used feminine hygiene article or a portion of the inserted hygiene article, such as an applicator, or both. In this embodiment, the hood 63 can be disposed over the used feminine hygiene article or portion of the inserted feminine hygiene article for increased discretion and cleanliness during transportation or disposal. FIG. 8 shows that a package 20 and wrapper 40 may have a non-linear line of weakness 28, 42, in that the line of weakness 28,42 may extend in a curved direction. The dimensions and values disclosed herein are not to be understood as being strictly limited to the exact numerical values recited. Instead, unless otherwise specified, each such dimension is intended to mean both tire recited value and a functionally equivalent range surrounding that value. For example, a dimension disclosed as “40 mm” is intended to mean “about 40 mm.” The citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention.
