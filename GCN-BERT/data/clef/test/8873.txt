The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising a modified release portion capable of controling the release of tamsulosin, and an immediate release portion capable of rapidly releasing solifenacin. More specifically, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising the modified release portion containing tamsulosin, a hydrogel-forming polymer, and a hydrophilic base, and the immediate release portion containing solifenacin and a hydrophilic substance, in a single formulation. BACKGROUND ART [0002] Tamsulosin is (R)-5-(2-{[2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy) ethyl] amino} propyl)-2-methoxybenzene-l-sulfonamide of the following structural formula. This compound was first disclosed, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in patent literature 1. [Chem. 1] Tamsulosin or its salts are known to have an activity of blocking adrenergic receptor aiA. In particular, tamsulosin hydrochloride has an activity of blocking ai receptors in the urethra and prostate, and is widely used as an agent for treating dysuria associated with benign prostatic h3co hyperplasia by reducing prostatic pressure in urethral pressure profile. It has been clinically confirmed that tamsulosin hydrochloride is effective in treating lower urinary tract symptoms, and thus, tamsulosin hydrochloride is an extremely useful drug in clinical use. Tamsulosin is placed on the market as Harnal (registered trademark) in Japan, Flomax (registered trademark) in the United States, and Omnic (registered trademark) in Europe. [0004] Solifenacin is represented by the following structural formula, and its chemical name is (R)-quinuclidin-3-yl (S)- 1-phenyl-l, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carboxylate. [Chem. 2] [0005] It has been reported that solifenacin or its salts have an excellent selective antagonistic activity against muscarinic M3 receptors, and are useful as an agent for preventing or treating urinary diseases such as urinary incontinence and pollakiuria in neurogenic pollakiuria, neurogenic bladder, nocturnal enuresis, unstable bladder, cystospasm, and chronic cystitis; respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and rhinitis; and digestive diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, and diverticulitis (see patent literature 2). [0006] In particular, solifenacin has high selectivity for M3 receptors located in the smooth muscles, gland tissues, or the like, in comparison with M2 receptors located in the heart or the like, and is useful as an M3 receptor antagonist with less side effects on the heart or the like, in particular, as an agent for preventing or treating urinary incontinence and pollakiuria, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, chronic bronchitis, asthma, rhinitis, and the like. Solifenacin is placed on the market, as an agent for treating urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and urge incontinence in overactive bladder, as Vesicare (registered trademark) in Japan, VESIcare (registered trademark) in the United States, and Vesicare (registered trademark) in Europe. [0007] A modified release formulation containing tamsulosin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt is known (for example, patent literatures 3 and 4), and is placed on the market as Omnic OCAS (registered trademark). This provides a modified release formulation with a blood drug concentration profile showing a lower peak/trough ratio than that of a conventional modified release formulation. The modified release formulation not only reduces the occurrence of side effects such as orthostatic anemia, but also is expected to increase the dose or sustain the efficacy for a long period. Further, food effects on blood drug concentrations can be avoided, and a high safety profile is expected in view of drug dosing compliance (patent literature 5). [0008] To treat lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, a pharmaceutical composition containing tamsulosin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, more specifically, a pharmaceutical composition for treating lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and an invention relates to a combination use of both drugs, are disclosed (patent literature 6). [0009] Tamsulosin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is effective in treating voiding symptoms and, by contrast, solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is effected in treating storage symptoms, and thus, both compounds exhibit contradictory effects. However, the combination use of both drugs unexpectedly resulted in the further amelioration of storage symptoms without the decrease in amelioration of voiding symptoms, in comparison with a single administration of each drug alone. Because it was confirmed that the combination therapy using tamsulosin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof was clinically effective in treating lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, it is desired to provide the medical field with a combined formulation (i.e., a single formulation) containing both drugs to improve drug dosing compliance. As an embodiment of the combined formulation for efficiently exhibiting the effects obtainable by the combination use, while maintaining the decreased occurrence of side effects and the sustainment of efficacies, a combined formulation of a modified release formulation containing tamsulosin with an ordinary formulation (an immediate release formulation) containing solifenacin may be proposed. However, because the drug dissolution rates in both formulations are different from each other, even when a single formulation (i.e., the combined forumulation) is prepared from both formulations, it is desired that the drug releasing rate in each formulation contained in the single formulation is not much affected. CITATION LIST PATENT LITERATURE [0011] [patent literature 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 56-110665 [patent literature 2] U.S. Patent No. 6,017,927 (corresponding to International Publication No.WO96/20194) [patent literature 3] International Publication No. WO94/06414 [patent literature 4] International Publication No. [patent literature 5] U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005-0100603 [patent literature 6] International Publication No. W02009/013846 SUMMARY OF INVENTION TECHNICAL PROBLEM [0012] The present inventors used the same components of the current products, i.e., Vesicare (product name) with a rapid drug releasing rate (85% for 30 minutes) and modified drug release formulation Omnic OCAS (product name), to prepare a single formulation (i.e., a combined formulation) (Comparative Example 1 described below). More specifically, bi-layered tablets consisting of a modified release portion containing tamsulosin, polyethylene oxide, polyethylene glycol, and magnesium stearate, and an immediate release portion containing solifenacin, lactose, corn starch, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and magnesium stearate were prepared. A dissolution test was carried out using the obtained bi-layered tablets to unexpectedly find: [1] that the dissolution rate of solifenacin was decreased, and was less than 85% for 30 minutes, and [2] that the maximum percentage of solifenacin dissolution was less than 90%. When the dissolution rate or the maximum percentage of solifenacin dissolution is decreased, it is concerned that a decreased availability in the living body, i.e., bioavailability, will be caused and, as a result, pharmacological effects equivalent to those obtained by the combination use of the current formulations (single drug formulations) cannot be obtained. [0013] An object of the present invention is to provide the medical field with a single formulation (a combined formulation) comprising a modified release portion containing tamsulosin and an immediate release portion containing solifenacin, more specifically, (1) to provide a single formulation (a combined formulation) having dissolution rates of both drugs (in particular, a dissolution rate of solifenacin in the immediate release portion) similar to those of the current single drug formulations, and (2) to provide a single formulation (a combined formulation) having maximum percentages of dissolution of both drugs (in particular, a maximum percentage of solifenacin dissolution in the immediate release portion) of 90% or more, and having a bioavailability equivalent to those of the current single drug formulations. SOLUTION TO PROBLEM [0014] The above results, i.e., the delay of the dissolution rate of solifenacin from the bi-layered tablet and the decrease in the maximum percentage of solifenacin dissolution, were remarkably unexpected for the present inventors, because the solubility of solifenacin in water is 610 mg/mL, and thus, solifenacin is classified into watersoluble substances in accordance with the expression of solubility described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, and further, the current formulation [Vesicare (registered trademark)] has been designed as an immediate release formulation. [0015] As a difference in the environment in the living body between an administration of the bi-layered tablet and an administration of each formulation (single drug formulation), it can be pointed out that the modified release portion is close to the immediate release portion, and thus, solifenacin dissolved from the immediate release portion exists near the modified release portion containing another drug. In particular, it is unexpected that there is a possibility that water-"soluble" solifenacin is dissolved and incorporated into the modified release portion containing a hydrogel-forming polymer. The disintegration times of immediate release single drug formulations, which are composed of the same components as those of mixed powders for an immediate release portion prepared in Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Example 1 described below, respectively, are shown in Figure 1, and the drug release times from the immediate release single drug formulations are shown in Figure 2. When the same components (solifenacin, lactose, corn starch, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and magnesium stearate) as those of the current formulation shown as the mixed powder for an immediate release portion described in Comparative Example 1 in these Figures were used, this formulation exhibited rapid disintegration and rapid drug release. This result was different from that of the single formulation (combined formulation), and thus, the result of the bilayered tablet as the single formulation (combined formulation) was remarkably unexpected. Under these circumstances, the present inventors focused attention on the improvement of the release rate of solifenacin and the maximum percentage of solifenacin dissolution, and have conducted intensive studies, and completed the present invention. [0017] The present invention provides: [1] a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising (1) a modified release portion comprising tamsulosin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (2) an immediate release portion comprising solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a hydrophilic substance; [2] the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of [1], wherein the immediate release portion is disintegrated and/or dissolved before the modified release portion forms a gel; [3] the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of [1] or [2], wherein 70% or more of solifenacin is dissolved for 15 minutes; [4] the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of [3], wherein 90% or more of solifenacin is dissolved for minutes; [5] the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of [4], wherein 70% or more of solifenacin is dissolved for minutes and 90% or more of solifenacin is dissolved for minutes; the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of wherein 85% or more of solifenacin is dissolved for minutes and 90% or more of solifenacin is dissolved for minutes; the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of any one of [1] to [6], wherein the hydrophilic substance one compound or two or more compounds selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol, maltose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and mannitol; the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of any one of [1] to [7], wherein the hydrophilic substance accounts for 5% by weight to 99% by weight; the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of any one of [1] to [8], wherein one hydrophilic substance or two or more hydrophilic substances selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol, maltose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and mannitol are used as a binder; the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of any one of [1] to [9], wherein mannitol as the hydrophilic substance is used as a filler; the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of any one of [1] to [10], wherein the modified release portion contains a polymer which forms a hydrogel; the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of wherein the hydrogel-forming polymer has a viscosity of 4000 mPa*s or more in a 1% aqueous solution °C) the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of wherein the hydrogel-forming polymer is one polymer or two or more polymers selected from the group consisting of polyethylene oxide, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, and a carboxyvinyl polymer; the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of wherein the hydrogel-forming polymer is polyethylene oxide; the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of wherein polyethylene oxide has a viscosity-average molecular weight of 5,000,000 or more; [16] the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of any one of [8] to [15], wherein the hydrogel-forming polymer accounts for 5% by weight to 95% by weight; [17] the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of any one of [1] to [16], wherein the modified release portion further contains an additive which allows water to penetrate into the formulation; [18] the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of [17], wherein the additive which allows water to penetrate into the formulation has a solubility such that the amount of water necessary to dissolve 1 g of the additive is 5 mL or less; [19] the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of [18], wherein the additive which allows water to penetrate into the formulation accounts for 3% by weight to 80% by weight; [20] the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of any one of [1] to [19], which is a pharmaceutical composition for treating lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia; and [21] the pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of any one of [1] to [20], wherein the pharmaceutical composition is a tablet. ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION [0018] The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising a modified release portion containing tamsulosin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and an immediate release portion containing solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention has a drug release similar to that of each single drug formulation, and thus, a single formulation (combined formulation) capable of expecting pharmacological effects equivalent to those of the single drug formulations can be provided. Further, it is expected to improve drug dosing compliance, because the number of the formulations to be administered is decreased. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS [Fig. 1] Figure 1 is a graph showing the disintegration times of immediate release single drug formulations, which are composed of the same components as those of mixed powders for an immediate release portion prepared in Examples 1 to 3 of the present invention and Comparative Example 1, respectively. [Fig. 2] Figure 2 is a graph showing the drug release profiles of the immediate release single drug formulations, which are composed of the same components as those of mixed powders for an immediate release portion prepared in Examples 1 to 3 of the present invention and Comparative Example 1, respectively. [Fig. 3] Figure 3 is a graph showing the dissolution profiles of the pharmaceutical compositions prepared in Examples 1 to 3 of the present invention and Comparative Example 1. [0020] With respect to the disintegration time of each immediate release single drug formulation shown in Figure 1, and the drug release from each immediate release single drug formulation shown in Figure 2, the immediate release single drug formulation composed of the same components as those of the mixed powder for an immediate release portion prepared in Comparative Example 1 exhibited rapid disintegration, and rapid drug release in which the dissolution was completed for 15 minutes, as well as the immediate release single drug formulations composed of the same components as those of the mixed powders for an immediate release portion prepared in Examples 1 to 3, respectively. With respect to the single formulations (combined formulations), as shown in Figure 3, although the immediate release single drug formulations exhibited the same rapid disintegration and the same rapid solubility, water-soluble solifenacin was dissolved and incorporated into the modified release portion containing a hydrogel-forming polymer, in the pharmaceutical composition prepared Comparative Example 1, and surprisingly the drug release rate did not reach 90%, and the complete drug release was not observed.

The term "immediate release portion" as used herein means an embodiment contained in the single formulation, and a portion which rapidly releases the drug from the pharmaceutical composition (in the case of a "soluble" drug, "release" has almost the same meanings as "dissolution"). The term "maximum percentage of dissolution" as used herein means the percentage of dissolution when a dissolution rate of the drug from the pharmaceutical composition reaches a plateau in a dissolution test under predetermined conditions. [0023] The pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of the present invention will be explained hereinafter. Tamsulosin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which may be used in the present invention, is easily available by preparing it in accordance with the methods described in JP 56-110665 and JP 62-114952, or modified methods thereof. Tamsulosin can form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with various inorganic and organic acids. These pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be used in the present invention. Examples of the salts include salts with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid; salts with organic acids such as fumaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, and succinic acid; salts with alkali metals such as sodium and potassium; and salts with alkali earth metals such as calcium and magnesium. Tamsulosin hydrochloride may be used in another embodiment. These salts can be prepared by a conventional method. [0025] The dose of tamsulosin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be appropriately determined for each patient in accordance with, for example, the route of administration, symptoms of a disease, the age and the sex of a patient to be treated, or the like. When tamsulosin hydrochloride is orally administered to an adult, the daily dose is approximately 0.1 mg to 1.6 mg as the active ingredient, and is orally administered once a day. [0026] Solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which may be used in the present invention, is easily available by preparing it in accordance with the method described in WO 96/20194, or a modified method thereof. [0027] Solifenacin can forms pharmaceutically acceptable salts with various inorganic and organic acids. These pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be used in the present invention. Examples of the salts include acid addition salts with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and phosphoric acid; and acid addition salts with organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid, picric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, and glutamic acid. Solifenacin succinate may be used in another embodiment. These salts can be prepared by a conventional method. The dose of solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be appropriately determined for each patient in accordance with, for example, the route of administration, symptoms of a disease, the age and the sex of a patient to be treated, or the like. When solifenacin succinate is orally administered to an adult, the daily dose is approximately 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg as the active ingredient, and is administered once or divided into two four doses per day. Alternatively, when it is intravenously administered to an adult, the dose is 0.01 mg/kg/dose to mg/kg/dose, and the dose is administered once or several times per day. [0029] The content of each drug is not particularly limited, long as it is an effective amount for the treatment or prevention. The content of each drug per formulation is, for example, 85% by weight or less, 80% by weight or less as another embodiment, 50% by weight or less as still another embodiment, and 10% by weight or less as still another embodiment. [0030] The "modified release portion" in the present invention comprises tamsulosin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a hydrogel-forming polymer (hereinafter sometimes referred to as a polymer which forms a hydrogel), and a hydrophilic base (hereinafter sometimes referred to as an additive which allows water to penetrate into the formulation). The "modified release portion" is defined herein as a portion in which the point showing a percentage of drug dissolution of 50% from the pharmaceutical composition is from 3 hours to 15 hours from the beginning of a dissolution test, when the dissolution test is carried out in accordance with a dissolution test, method 2 (paddle method, 50 rpm to 200 rpm) described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, or a dissolution test carried out in accordance with a dissolution test, method 1 (basket method, rpm to 200 rpm) described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia. The hydrogel-forming polymer, which may be used in the present invention, is not particularly limited, so long as has properties, such as viscosity and the like at the time of gelling, that maintain the form of the almost completely gelled formulation against the motility of the digestive tract accompanied by food digestion, and migrate the gelled formulation to the colon in the lower digestive tract while maintaining the shape to a certain extent. As the hydrogel-forming polymer, a polymer having a high viscosity at the time of gelling, such as a polymer with a viscosity of 4000 mPa*s or more in a 1% aqueous solution at “C, may be used. The properties of a polymer are dependent on its molecular weight, and a polymer with a higher molecular weight is preferable as the hydrogel-forming polymer, which may be used in the present invention. Examples of the polymer with a higher molecular weight include polyethylene oxide with an average molecular weight of 5,000,000 or more, an average molecular weight of 7,000,000 or more in another embodiment, an average molecular weight of 5,000,000 to 8,000,000 in still another embodiment, and an average molecular weight of 7,000,000 to 8,000,000 in still another embodiment. [0033] Examples of the polymer include: polyethylene oxide (PEO) [for example, product names, Polyox WSR-308 (average molecular weight: 8,000,000, viscosity: 10000-15000 mPa*s (1% aqueous solution at 25°C)), Polyox WSR-303 (average molecular weight: 7, 000, 000, viscosity: 7500-10000 mPa-s (1% aqueous solution at 25°C)), Polyox WSR Coagulant (average molecular weight: 5,000,000, viscosity: 5500-7500 mPa*s (the same as above)), each manufactured by Dow] ; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) [for examples, product names, Metolose 90SH100000 (viscosity: 4100-5600 mPa*s (1% aqueous solution at 20*0), and Metolose 90SH30000 (viscosity: 25000-35000 mPas (2% aqueous solution at 20°C)), each manufactured by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.]; carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) [for example, product names, Sunrose F-1000MC (average molecular weight: 420,000, viscosity: 8000-12000 mPa*s (the same as above)), and HEC DAICEL SE900 (average molecular weight: 1,560,000, viscosity: 4000-5000 mPa*s (the same as above)), manufactured by Daicel chemical Industries, Ltd.]; and carboxyvinyl polymers [for example, Carbopol 940 (average molecular weight: approximately 2,500,000), manufactured by B. F. GoodRich Chemical)]. Polyethylene oxide may be used in another embodiment. [0034] These hydrogel-forming polymers may be used alone, or as an appropriate combination of two or more thereof. When two or more polymers having a viscosity or an average molecular weight beyond the above-mentioned specific ranges are mixed, and the resulting mixture has the same properties within the specific ranges, the mixture of the polymers is included in the hydrogel-forming polymers which may be used in the present invention. [0035] To release a drug in the colon of a human, it is preferable that part of the gelled formulation remains in the colon after at least 6 to 8 hours, preferably 12 hours or more, from the administration of the formulation. The preparation of a hydrogel-forming formulation having such properties varies according to the size of the formulation, the kind of polymers, properties of a drug and an additive that allows water to penetrate into the formulation, the contents thereof, and the like. For a formulation of 600 mg or less per tablet, the content of the hydrogel-forming polymer with respect to the weight of the formulation is, for example, 5% by weight to 95% by weight, and preferably 10% by weight to 90% by weight in another embodiment, and the content of the hydrogel-forming polymer with respect to the weight of the modified release portion is, for example, 10% by weight to 95% by weight, and preferably 15% by weight to 90% by weight in another embodiment. The content per formulation is preferably 40 mg or more, and 60 mg or more in another embodiment. When the content is lower than these values, there is a possibility that sufficient sustained release is not achieved, due to erosion in the digestive tract for a long time. [0036] The additive which allows water to penetrate into the formulation (also referred to as "hydrophilic base"), which may be used in the present invention, is not particular limited, so long as it is a substance capable of imparting, to the formulation, the feature which ensures penetration of water into the formulation. Examples of the hydrophilic base include a substance having a solubility such that the amount of water necessary to dissolve 1 g of the hydrophilic base at 20±5°C is 5 mL or less, and 4 mL or less in another embodiment. When the hydrophilic base has a higher solubility to water, the effect that allows water to penetrate into the formulation is higher. Examples of the hydrophilic base include: water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol [PEG: for example, product names PEG 400, PEG 1500, PEG 4000, PEG 6000, and PEG 20000 (manufactured by NOF Corporation)], and polyvinylpyrrolidone [PVP: for example, product name PVP K30 (manufactured by BASF)]; sugar alcohols, such as D-sorbitol and xylitol; saccharides, such as sucrose, anhydrous maltose, D-fructose, dextran (for example, Dextran 40), and glucose; surfactants, such as polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycol [for example, Pluronic F68 (manufactured by Asahi Denka and the like)]; salts, such as sodium chloride and magnesium chloride; organic acids, such as citric acid and tartaric acid; amino acids, such as glycine, (3-alanine, and lysine hydrochloride; and aminosaccharides, such as meglumine. In another embodiment, PEG6000, PVP, D-sorbitol, or the like may be used. These hydrophilic bases may be used alone, or as an appropriate combination of two or more thereof. The content of the hydrophilic base may vary according to various factors, such as properties (solubility, therapeutic effect, and the like) and content of a drug, solubility of the hydrophilic base, properties of the hydrogel-forming polymer, conditions of a subject to be administered, and the like, but an amount in which gelling is almost completely achieved during the retention of the formulation in the upper digestive tract is preferred. A retention time of a drug in the upper digestive tract varies according to species and individuals, but those after administration in dogs and humans are approximately 2 hours and approximately 4 to 5 hours, respectively [Br. J. Clin. Pharmac., (1988) 26, 435-443]. In humans, the content of the hydrophilic base is preferably an amount in which gelling of the formulation is almost completely achieved after 4 to 5 hours from the administration thereof. The content is, for example, approximately 3% by weight to 80% by weight (approximately 3% by weight to 60% by weight in another embodiment) with respect to the weight of the formulation, and for example, approximately 5% by weight to 80% by weight (approximately 5% by weight to 60% by weight in another embodiment) with respect to the weight of the modified release portion. [0038] The hydrophilic substance which forms the "immediate release portion" used in the present invention is not particularly limited, so long as the immediate release portion can be disintegrated and/or dissolved. In another embodiment, The hydrophilic substance is not particularly limited, so long as the immediate release portion can be almost completely disintegrated before the modified release portion forms a gel. The state "almost completely" can be detected or judged when the hydrophilic substance which forms the matrix of the immediate release portion is almost completely disintegrated visually under the dissolution test conditions. The state "almost completely" can be detected or judged, on the basis of the results of the dissolution test, when 70% or more of the drug (85% or more in another embodiment, and 90% or more in still another embodiment) is dissolved for 15 minutes, or when 85% or more of the drug (90% or more in another embodiment) is dissolved for minutes and 90% or more of the drug is dissolved for minutes. The maximum percentage of dissolution in the immediate release portion is defined by showing the percentage of drug dissolution from the pharmaceutical composition after 60 minutes under the conditions where the dissolution test is carried out in accordance with a dissolution test, method 2 (paddle method, 50 rpm to rpm) described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, or a dissolution test carried out in accordance with a dissolution test, method 1 (basket method, 50 rpm to rpm) described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia. [0039] Examples of the hydrophilic substance include Dmannitol, maltose, polyethylene glycol, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. [0040] The immediate release portion comprises solifenacin or a salt thereof and the hydrophilic substance. The hydrophilic substance can has functions as a filler and/or a binder. As the filler, D-mannitol, maltose, polyethylene glycol, or polyvinylpyrrolidone may be used. As the binder, maltose, polyethylene glycol, or polyvinylpyrrolidone may be used. Examples of polyethylene glycol (PEG) include PEG 400, PEG 1500, PEG 4000, PEG 6000, and PEG 20000 (products name, each manufactured by NOF Corporation). Examples of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) include Kollidon K25 and Kollidon K90 (product names, each manufactured by BASF). [0041] With respect to the state of the hydrophilic substance which exists in the immediate release portion, the present invention includes an embodiment in which the hydrophilic substance is uniformly contained in the immediate release portion, and an embodiment in which the hydrophilic substance ununiformly exists in the interface of the immediate release portion. The hydrophilic substances may be used alone, or as an appropriate combination of two or more thereof. The content of the hydrophilic substance is, for example, 2% by weight to 40% by weight (4% by weight to 35% by weight in another embodiment) with respect to the formulation, and 5% by weight to 95% by weight (10% by weight to 90% by weight in another embodiment, and 20% by weight to 80% by weight in still another embodiment) with respect to the immediate release portion. [0042] Various pharmaceutical additives may be appropriately used to prepare the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, if desired, and are not particularly limited, so long as they are pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable. Examples of the pharmaceutical additive include a binder, a stabilizer, a disintegrating agent, an acidulant, an effervescent agent, an artificial sweetener, a flavor, a lubricant, a coloring agent, a buffer, an antioxidant, and a surfactant. [0043] Examples of the binder include gum arabic, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, and hydroxyethylcellulose. [0044] Examples of the stabilizer include yellow ferric oxide, red ferric oxide, and black iron oxide. The pharmaceutical composition for oral administration of the present invention preferably contains yellow ferric oxide and/or red ferric oxide as the stabilizer for polyethylene oxide. When the stabilizer is added by physical mixing in the matrix, the content of the stabilizer is, for example, 1% by weight to 20% by weight (3% by weight to 15% by weight in another embodiment) with respect to the weight of the formulation. For example, the content of red ferric oxide is, for example, 5% by weight to 20% by weight (10% by weight to 15% by weight in another embodiment) with respect to the weight of the formulation. The content of yellow ferric oxide is, for example, 1% by weight to 20% by weight (3% by weight to 10% by weight in another embodiment). When the stabilizer is coated by film coating, the content is, for example, 0.3% by weight to 2% by weight (0.5% by weight to 1.5% by weight in another embodiment) with respect to the weight of the tablet. In this case, the concentration of yellow ferric oxide or red ferric oxide contained in the film is, for example, 5% by weight to 50% by weight (10% by weight to 20% by weight in another embodiment). The term "physical mixing in the matrix" as used herein means, for example, a method in which a drug, polyethylene oxide, and the ferric oxide(s) are uniformly dispersed, and as a result, the drug and the ferric oxide are uniformly dispersed in PEO as the main base of the formulation.
