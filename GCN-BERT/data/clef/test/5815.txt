Example 5: Synthesis of Compound 12-Br
Compound 10-Br-Cl (2.03 g, 5.675 mmol), compound 11 (1.86 g, 6.243 mmol), DIPEA (0.81 g, 6.243 mmol) and acetonitrile (40 mL) were added to a three-necked bottle, then heated to 70Â° C. and stirred for 5 hours. After that, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. After the solvent was distilled off, ethyl acetate (100 mL) was added and the mixture was washed with dilute hydrochloric acid (0.01 M/L, 200 mL).
The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent was distilled off to obtain the product (3.5 g, yield 100%).
