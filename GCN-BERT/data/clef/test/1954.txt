FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [Not Applicable] BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant which is a chain substituted amphetamine derivative. Similar to amphetamine and cocaine, methylphenidate targets the central nervous system, specifically the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). Methylphenidate is thought to act by increasing the concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft, as methylphenidate has both dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) binding capabilities. Although an amphetamine derivative, the pharmacology of methylphenidate and amphetamine differ, as amphetamine is a dopamine transport substrate whereas methylphenidate works as a dopamine transport blocker. As a norepinephrine and dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, methylphenidate thus blocks re-uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) into presynaptic neurons (and possibly stimulates the release of dopamine from dopamine nerve terminals at high doses), thereby increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the synapse. In some in vitro studies, methylphenidate has been shown to be more potent as an inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake/re-uptake when compared to dopamine. However, some in vivo studies have indicated that methylphenidate is more potent in potentiating extracellular dopamine concentrations than norepinephrine concentrations. Unlike amphetamine, it has been duggested in the scientific and/or clinical research comunity that methylphenidate does not seem to significantly facilitate the release of these two monoamine neurotransmitters at therapeutic doses. Four isomers of methylphenidate are known to exist: d-erythro-methylphenidate, l-erythro-methylphenidate, d-threo-methylphenidate, and l-threo-methylphenidate. Originally, methylphenidate was marketed as a mixture of two racemates, d/l-erythro-methylphenidate and d/l-threo-methylphenidate. Subsequent research showed that most of the pharmacological activity of the mixture is associated with the threo-isomer resulting in the marketing of the isolated threo-methylphenidate racemate. Later, the scientific community determined that the d-threo-isomer is mostly responsible for the stimulant activity. Consequently, new products were developed containing only d-threo-methylphenidate (also known as “d-threo-MPH”). Stimulants, including methylphenidate (“MPH”), are believed to enhance the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and/or central nervous system (CNS). Stimulants such as MPH and the various forms and derivatives thereof are used for the treatment of a range of conditions and disorders predominantly encompassing, for example, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), obesity, narcolepsy, appetite suppression, depression, anxiety and/or wakefulness. Methylphenidate is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy. Methylphenidate has also shown efficacy for some off-label indications that include depression, obesity and lethargy. In some embodiments, the prodrugs of the present technology may be administered for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, or any condition that requires the blocking of the norepinephrine and/or dopamine transporters. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children has been treated with stimulants for many years. However, more recently, an increase in the number of prescriptions for ADHD therapy in the adult population has, at times, outperformed the growth of the pediatric market. Although there are various drugs currently in use for the treatment of ADHD, including some stimulants and some non-stimulant drugs, methylphenidate (commercially available from, for example, Novartis International AG (located in Basel, Switzerland) under the trademark Ritalin®) is commonly prescribed. Moreover, during classroom trials, non-stimulants have shown to be less effective in improving behavior and attention of ADHD afflicted children than amphetamine derivatives. Behavioral deterioration (rebound or “crashing”) is observed in a significant portion of children with ADHD as the medication wears off, typically in the afternoon or early evening. Rebound symptoms include, for example, irritability, crankiness, hyperactivity worse than in the unmedicated state, sadness, crying, and in rare cases psychotic episodes. The symptoms may subside quickly or last several hours. Some patients may experience rebound/crashing so severe that treatment must be discontinued. Rebound/crashing effects can also give rise to addictive behavior by enticing patients to administer additional doses of stimulant with the intent to prevent anticipated rebound/crashing negative outcomes and side effects. Stimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, have been shown in the conventional art to exhibit noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects that can lead to cardiovascular events comprising, for example, increased heart rate, hypertension, palpitations, tachycardia and in isolated cases cardiomyopathy, stroke, myocardial infarction and/or sudden death. Consequently, currently available stimulants expose patients with pre-existing structural cardiac abnormalities or other severe cardiac indications to even greater health risks and are frequently not used or used with caution in this patient population. Methylphenidate, like other stimulants and amphetamine derivatives, can become addictive and is prone to substance abuse. Oral abuse has been reported, and euphoria can be achieved through intranasal and intravenous administration. Methylphenidate also has limited water solubility especially in an unconjugated form. The properties of limited bioavailability and limited water solubility make formulating methylphenidate for oral administration more difficult because the dosage forms for administration are limited. There is a need in the art for more bioavailable and water soluble forms of methylphenidate that maintain the pharmacological benefit when administered, in particular via the oral route. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present technology utilizes, for example, covalent conjugation of methylphenidate, various forms and derivatives thereof with certain alcohol, amine, oxoacid, thiol, or derivatives thereof to provide, for example, improved bioavailability and increased water solubility when compared to unconjugated methylphenidate. The increased bioavailability and/or increased water solubility in some instances provides the ability of the prodrug or composition to be administered in forms that are not easily utilized with the unconjugated methylphenidate. For example, the increased water solubility of the conjugate compared to unconjugated methylphenidate provides the ability of the conjugate or prodrug to be administered in an oral thin film or strip with higher dose loading capacity as compared to unconjugated methylphenidate In one aspect, the present technology provides a prodrug composition comprising at least one conjugate, the conjugate comprising at least one methylphenidate, and at least one alcohol, amine, oxoacid, thiol, or derivatives thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present technology provides at least one methylphenidate or one or more derivatives or combinations thereof (MPH, methyl phenyl(piperidin-2-yl)acetate) conjugated to at least one organic or inorganic oxoacid to form oxylalkyl carbamates, which are novel prodrugs compositions and/or conjugates of methylphenidate. In some embodiments, the at least one conjugate or prodrug of the present technology was surprisingly discovered by conjugating methylphenidate to a series of organic or inorganic oxoacids through various linker molecules. In some embodiments, the linkers are (acyloxy)alkyloxy moieties or derivatives thereof. The linker chain is connected on one end to methylphenidate via a secondary carbamate bond and on the other to the oxoacid via an ester bond. The use of the term “methylphenidate” herein is meant to include any of the stereoisomer forms of methylphenidate, including the four stereoisomers: d-erythro-methylphenidate, l-erythro-methylphenidate, d-threo-methylphenidate and l-threo-methylphenidate and the salts and derivatives thereof. Methylphenidate is interchangeable with methyl phenyl(piperidin-2-yl)acetate. The term “methylphenidate” includes all salt forms. Methylphenidate is also known by its trade name Ritalin®, Ritalin® SR, Methylin®, Methylin® ER (all commercially available from Novartis International AG, of Basil, Switzerland). The methylphenidate used in the present technology can be any stereoisomer of methylphenidate, including, but not limited to, d-erythro-methylphenidate, l-erythro-methylphenidate, d-threo-methylphenidate and l-threo-methylphenidate. In some embodiments, the methylphenidate can be a mixture of two or more racemates, for example, but not limited to, d/l-erythro-methylphenidate and d/l-threo-methylphenidate. In some preferred embodiments, the conjugates contain racemic threo-methylphenidate. In other preferred embodiments, the alcohol, amine, oxoacid, or thiol is linked to a single d-threo-methylphenidate isomer. Depending on the chemical structure of the linkers and alcohols, amines, oxoacids, and thiols as well as the chiral composition of the methylphenidate to which they are attached, the resulting prodrug conjugates can be optically active mixtures of isomers, racemic mixtures, single isomers or combinations thereof. As used herein, the phrases such as “decreased,” “reduced,” “diminished” or “lowered” are meant to include at least about a 10% change in pharmacological activity, area under the curve (AUC) and/or peak plasma concentration (Cmax) with greater percentage changes being preferred for reduction in abuse potential and overdose potential of the conjugates of the present technology as compared to unconjugated methylphenidate. For instance, the change may also be greater than about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 35%, about 45%, about 55%, about 65%, about 75%, about 85%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, or increments therein. As used herein, the term “prodrug” refers to a substance converted from an inactive form of a drug to an active drug in the body by a chemical or biological reaction. In the present technology, the prodrug is a conjugate of at least one drug, methylphenidate, and at least one oxoacid, for example. Thus, the conjugates of the present technology are prodrugs and the prodrugs of the present technology are conjugates. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some embodiments, they may be easier to administer or process than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be more bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An embodiment of a prodrug would be a methylphenidate conjugate that is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically more active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug is designed to alter the metabolism or the transport characteristics of a drug in certain embodiments, to mask side-effects or toxicity, to improve bioavailability and/or water solubility, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug in other discrete embodiments. In some embodiments, the present technology provides at least one prodrug composition comprising at least one conjugate. The at least one conjugate may comprise at least one methylphenidate and at least one alcohol, amine, oxoacid, thiol, or derivatives therof. In some embodiments, the conjugate further comprises at least one linker. The linker chemically bonds the methylphenidate to the alcohol, amine, oxoacid, or thiol via one or more covalent bonds. Depending on the linker and the alcohol, amine, oxoacid, and thiol conjugated to methylphenidate or derivative thereof, the at least one prodrug formed can be either a neutral (uncharged), a free acid, a free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable anionic or cationic salt form or salt mixtures with any ratio between positive and negative components. These anionic salt forms can include, but are not limited to, for example, acetate, l-aspartate, besylate, bicarbonate, carbonate, d-camsylate, l-camsylate, citrate, edisylate, formate, fumarate, gluconate, hydrobromide/bromide, hydrochloride/chloride, d-lactate, l-lactate, d,l-lactate, d,l-malate, l-malate, mesylate, pamoate, phosphate, succinate, sulfate, bisulfate, d-tartrate, l-tartrate, d,l-tartrate, meso-tartrate, benzoate, gluceptate, d-glucuronate, hybenzate, isethionate, malonate, methylsufate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, stearate, tosylate, thiocyanate, acefyllinate, aceturate, aminosalicylate, ascorbate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphocarbonate, decanoate, hexanoate, cholate, cypionate, dichloroacetate, edentate, ethyl sulfate, furate, fusidate, galactarate (mucate), galacturonate, gallate, gentisate, glutamate, glutamate, glutarate, glycerophosphate, heptanoate (enanthate), hydroxybenzoate, hippurate, phenylpropionate, iodide, xinafoate, lactobionate, laurate, maleate, mandelate, methanesufonate, myristate, napadisilate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, pyrophosphate, salicylate, salicylsulfate, sulfosalicylate, tannate, terephthalate, thiosalicylate, tribrophenate, valerate, valproate, adipate, 4-acetamidobenzoate, camsylate, octanoate, estolate, esylate, glycolate, thiocyanate, or undecylenate. The cationic salt forms can include, but are not limited to, for example, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, aluminium, lithium, cholinate, lysinium, ammonium, or tromethamine. Without wishing to be limited to the following theory, it is believed that the prodrugs/conjugates of the present technology undergo enzyme hydrolysis of the ester bond in vivo, which subsequently leads to a cascade reaction resulting in rapid regeneration of methylphenidate and the respective oxoacid, metabolites thereof and/or derivatives thereof.

Additional preferred oxoacids of the present technology include fatty acids, hydroxy carboxylic acids, amino acids, optionally esterified phosphoric acids and optionally esterified dicarboxylic acids. More preferred oxoacids of the present technology are C2-24 carboxylic acids, aryl carboxylic acids, aminocaproic acid, phosphoric acid, standard amino acids and non-standard amino acids. Amino Acids Amino acids are one of the most important building blocks of life. They constitute the structural subunit of proteins, peptides, and many secondary metabolites. In addition to the 22 standard (proteinogenic) amino acids that make up the backbone of proteins, there are hundreds of other natural (non-standard) amino acids that have been discovered either in free form or as components in natural products. The amino acids used in some embodiments of the prodrugs of this invention include natural amino acids, synthetic (non-natural, unnatural) amino acids, and their derivatives. Standard Amino Acids There are currently 22 known standard or proteinogenic amino acids that make up the monomeric units of proteins and are encoded in the genetic code. The standard amino acids include alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, pyrrolysine, selenocysteine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine. These standard amino acids have the general structure shown in FIG. 10, where R represents the side chain on the α-carbon. Non-Standard Amino Acids Non-standard amino acids can be found in proteins created by chemical modifications of standard amino acids already incorporated in the proteins. This group also includes amino acids that are not found in proteins but are still present in living organisms either in their free form or bound to other molecular entities. Non-standard amino acids occur mostly as intermediates in metabolic pathways of standard amino acids and are not encoded by the genetic code. Examples of non-standard amino acids include but are not limited to ornithine, homoarginine, citrulline, homocitrulline, homoserine, theanine, γ-aminobutyric acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, sarcosine, cartinine, 2-aminoadipic acid, pantothenic acid, taurine, hypotaurine, lanthionine, thiocysteine, cystathionine, homocysteine, β-amino acids such as β-alanine, β-aminoisobutyric acid, β-leucine, β-lysine, β-arginine, β-tyrosine, β-phenylalanine, isoserine, β-glutamic acid, β-tyrosine, β-dopa (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine), α,α-disubstituted amino acids such as 2-aminoisobutyric acid, isovaline, di-n-ethylglycine, N-methyl acids such as N-methyl-alanine, L-abrine, hydroxy-amino acids such as 4-hydroxyproline, 5-hydroxylysine, 3-hydroxyleucine, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, cyclic amino acids such as 1-aminocyclopropyl-1-carboxylic acid, azetidine-2-carboxylic acid and pipecolic acid. Some structures of suitable non-standard amino acids that can be used in some embodiments of the prodrugs of this invention are shown in FIG. 11.

Some structures of suitable synthetic amino acids that can be used in some embodiments of the prodrugs of this invention are shown in FIG. 12. Linkers In some embodiments of the present technology, the methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, is conjugated to one or more organic or inorganic oxoacids via one or more linkers. Linker moieties of the present technology, which connect the one or more organic or inorganic oxoacids to the methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, are preferably at least one (acyloxy)alkyloxy group or a derivative thereof with the general formula: [in-line-formulae]—C(O)O—X—O—[/in-line-formulae] wherein X is selected from a representative group including optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted alkylaryl, optionally substituted heteroalkyl, optionally substituted heteroaryl, optionally substituted heterocycle, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted alkynyl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl, optionally substituted cycloalkenyl, optionally substituted cycloalkynyl, or optionally substituted alkoxy substituents. Preferred embodiments of the present technology include linkers where X is at least one aliphatic group. More preferred embodiments include linkers where X is at least one alkyl group. Even more preferred embodiments are (acyloxy)methyloxy, (acyloxy)ethyloxy, or (acyloxy)methyl(methyl)oxy linkers. Administration, Formulation and Advantages The prodrugs or conjugate compositions of the present technology can be administered orally and, upon administration, release the active methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, after being hydrolyzed in the body. Not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the oxoacids that are conjugated to the methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, of the present technology are naturally occurring metabolites, pharmaceutically active compounds or mimetics thereof or derivatives thereof. It is believed that the prodrugs or conjugates of the present technology can be easily recognized by physiological systems resulting in hydrolysis and release of methylphenidate. The prodrugs of the present technology are believed to have no or limited pharmacological activity themselves and consequently may follow a metabolic pathway that differs from the parent drug (i.e., methylphenidate). Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that by choosing suitable linkers and oxoacids (“ligands”), the release of methylphenidate into the systemic circulation can be controlled even when the prodrug is administered via routes other than oral administration. In one embodiment, the at least one conjugated methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, of the present technology are believed to surprisingly release methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, similar to free or unmodified methylphenidate. In another alternative embodiment, the at least one conjugated methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, of the present technology are believed to surprisingly be released in a controlled or sustained form. It has been surprisingly found that in some embodiments of the present technology, the prodrugs or conjugates of the present application provide an increased bioavailability as compared with unconjugated methylphenidate. In some embodiments, the prodrugs or conjugates of the present technology surprisingly provide increased water solubility as compared with unconjugated methylphenidate. In some embodiments, the prodrugs or compositions of the present technology have at least about 1.2× or at least about 1.5× the water solubility of unconjugated methylphenidate. In some embodiments, the prodrugs or compositions of the present technology have at least about 1.7×, at least about 2.0×, at least about 2.2×, at least about 2.5×, at least about 3.0×, at least about 4.0× or at least about 5× the water solubility of unconjugated methylphenidate, and include any multiples in between or above that have water solubility greater than unconjugated methylphenidate. Not to be bound by any particular theory, the increase in water solubility may allow for the conjugate to be formed into certain dosage forms at higher concentrations, dosage strengths or higher dose loading capacities than unconjugated methylphenidate. In some embodiments, these dosage forms include, but are not limited to, forms that require water solubility, including, but not limited to, liquids and oral thin films or strips. In a further embodiment, the at least one prodrug or conjugate of the present technology is believed to unexpectedly have increased absorption over unmodified methylphenidate. In yet another embodiment, the at least one prodrug or conjugate of the present technology is believed to unexpectedly have increased bioavailability over unconjugated methylphenidate. In some embodiments, the conjugate is capable of being enzymatically or hydrolytically activated or converted into the active form. In one embodiment, the composition or prodrug described herein would release methylphenidate, its active metabolites and/or derivates and their combination resulting in increased peak plasma concentrations and/or exposure to methylphenidate, its active metabolites and/or derivatives and their combination when compared to free or unconjugated methylphenidate at equimolar doses. Not to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that this may allow for administration of a lower dose with equal or improved therapeutic effect, but with fewer and/or less severe side effects when compared to unmodified methylphenidate, thereby improving the safety profile of the drug. Common side effects of methylphenidate are nervousness, agitation, anxiety, and insomnia or drowsiness. Other common side effects are abdominal pain, weight loss, hypersensitivity, nausea, dizziness, palpitation, headache, dyskinesia, blood pressure, pulse changes, tachycardia, angina, and cardiac arrhythmia. In a further embodiment, the increased absorption over unmodified methylphenidate, or improved water solubility over free methylphenidate may provide for a better bioavailability of methylphenidate referring to a higher area under the curve (AUC) or having higher circulating plasma concentrations. In one embodiment, the at least one prodrug or conjugate of the present technology would alter the metabolic profile of methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, by, for example, changing the amounts and/or ratio of methylphenidate and its metabolites, such as the inactive ritalinic acid within the body. The at least one prodrug or conjugate, for example, would decrease the number and/or amount of metabolites, including active, inactive, toxic or non-toxic metabolites, produced by unmodified methylphenidate. Not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that this change in metabolism may potentially alleviate certain side effects and improve upon the safety profile of methylphenidate. In another embodiment, the prodrugs or conjugates of the present technology would unexpectedly produce reduced interpatient variability of methylphenidate plasma concentrations. Not to be bound by any particular theory, it can be assumed that the reduction of interpatient variability of methylphenidate plasma concentrations may be due to either increased bioavailability or a modified metabolic pathway or a combination of both. In another embodiment, the prodrug of the present technology would alter the metabolic pathway of the released methylphenidate when compared to unmodified methylphenidate. It is believed that this new metabolism may decrease interpatient variability and/or reduce side effects associated with unconjugated methylphenidate or any of its metabolites. In a further embodiment, the at least one prodrug or conjugate of the present technology can comprise racemic d- and l-methylphenidate which is preferably hydrolyzed to d-methylphenidate in the body and thus delivers more of the therapeutically active d-isomer. Wishing not to be bound by any particular theory, this may reduce potential side effects caused by l-methylphenidate and/or its metabolites. In another embodiment, the at least one prodrug or conjugate of the present technology is believed to unexpectedly generate a Cmax value of released methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, that is higher than the Cmax value produced by unconjugated methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, when administered orally at equimolar doses. In a further embodiment, the at least one prodrug or conjugate are believed to surprisingly generate an AUC value of released methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, that is higher than the AUC value produced by unconjugated methylphenidate when administered orally at equimolar doses. In yet another embodiment, the at least one prodrug or conjugate is believed to surprisingly generate both a Cmax and an AUC value of released methylphenidate that is higher than the Cmax and AUC values produced by unconjugated methylphenidate when administered orally at equimolar doses. In some embodiments, the AUC is about 110% or greater of the AUC of unconjugated methylphenidate, when administered orally at equimolar doses, for example about 110% to about 260%, alternatively from about 120% to about 260%, alternatively from about 110% to about 250%, including, but not limited to, about 110%, about 130%, about 150%, about 170%, about 190%, about 210%, about 230%, about 250% or any amounts in between, in increments of about 0.5%, about 1%, about 2%, about 2.5%, about 5%, about 10%, or about 20%. In some embodiments, the Cmax is about 110% or greater of the Cmax of unconjugated methylphenidate, when administered orally at equimolar doses, for example about 110% to about 260%, alternatively from about 120% to about 260%, alternatively from about 110% to about 250%, including, but not limited to, about 110%, about 130%, about 150%, about 170%, about 190%, about 210%, about 230%, about 250% or any amounts in between, in increments of about about 0.5%, about 1%, about 2%, about 2.5%, about 5%, about 10%, or about 20%. In another embodiment, the at least one prodrug or conjugate is believed to unexpectedly generate a Tmax value of released methylphenidate that is longer than the Tmax value produced by unconjugated methylphenidate when administered at equimolar doses. In another embodiment, the at least one prodrug or conjugate is believed to surprisingly generate a Tmax value of released methylphenidate that is similar to the Tmax value produced by unconjugated methylphenidate, when administered at equimolar doses. In some embodiments, the AUC is about 50% or smaller of the AUC of unconjugated methylphenidate, when administered intranasally or intravenously at equimolar doses, for example about 50% to about 0.1%, alternatively from about 25% to about 0.1%, alternatively from about 50% to about 1%, including, but not limited to, about 50%, about 40%, about 30%, about 20%, about 10%, about 1% or any amounts in between, in increments of about about 0.5%, about 1%, about 2%, about 2.5%, about 5% or about 10%. Methylphenidate is addictive and prone to substance abuse because of its pharmacological similarity to cocaine and amphetamine. Oral abuse has been reported to lead to hallucinations, paranoia, euphoria, and delusional disorder. Oral abuse may subsequently escalate to intravenous and intranasal abuse. Euphoria has been reported after intravenous administration of methylphenidate. When administered intranasally the effect is found to be similar to intranasal use of amphetamines. In some alternative embodiments of the present technology, the compounds, prodrugs, compositions and/or methods of the present technology are believed to provide reduced potential for overdose, reduced potential for abuse and/or improve the characteristics of methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof with regard to toxicities or suboptimal release profiles. In some alternative embodiments of the present technology, some compositions of the present technology may preferably have no or a substantially decreased pharmacological activity when administered through injection or intranasal routes of administration. However, they remain orally bioavailable. Without wishing to be limited to the below theory, it is believed that overdose protection may occur due to the conjugates being exposed to different enzymes and/or metabolic pathways after oral administration whereby the conjugate of the present technology is exposed to the gut and first-pass metabolism as opposed to exposure to enzymes in the circulation or mucosal membranes in the nose which limits the ability of the methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, from being released from the conjugate. Therefore, in some alternative embodiments, abuse resistance is provided by limiting the effectiveness of alternative routes of administration. Again, not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the bioavailability can be a result of the hydrolysis of the chemical linkage (i.e., a covalent linkage) following oral administration. In at least one alternative embodiment, the prodrugs of the present technology are envisioned to not hydrolyze or to hydrolyze at a reduced rate or to a limited extent via non-oral routes. As a result, they are believed to not generate high plasma or blood concentrations of released methylphenidate when injected or snorted compared to free methylphenidate administered through these routes. In some alternative embodiments, it is contemplated that at least some compositions of the present technology comprising the prodrugs of one or more methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, are resistant to abuse by parenteral routes of administration, such as intravenous “shooting,” or intranasal “snorting,” that are often employed during illicit use. In at least one contemplated alternative embodiment, release of methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, is reduced when the composition of the present technology is delivered by parenteral routes. In some other contemplated alternative embodiments, the conjugates of the present technology, since they are believed to include covalently bound methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, are not able to be physically manipulated to release the methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, from the conjugated methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, by methods, for example, of grinding up or crushing of solid forms. Further, some alternative conjugates of the present technology are contemplated to exhibit resistance to chemical hydrolysis under conditions a potential drug abuser may apply to “extract” the active portion of the molecule, for example, by boiling, or acidic or basic solution treatment of the conjugate. In some alternative embodiments, some compositions containing prodrugs or conjugates of the present technology preferably have no or a substantially decreased pharmacological activity when administered through injection or intranasal routes of administration. However, they remain orally bioavailable. For example, in one alternate embodiment, the at least one prodrug or conjugate of the present technology is contemplated to surprisingly maintain its effectiveness and abuse resistance following the crushing of the tablet, capsule or other oral dosage form utilized to deliver the therapeutic component (i.e., active ingredient/drug) which is believed to be due to the inherent release profile being a property of the composition not formulation. In contrast, conventional extended release formulations used to control the release of methylphenidate are subject to release of up to the entire methylphenidate content immediately following crushing. When the content of the crushed tablet is injected or snorted, the large dose of methylphenidate produces the “rush” effect sought by addicts. The present technology provides a stimulant based treatment modality and dosage form for certain disorders requiring the stimulation of the CNS such as, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), autistic spectrum disorder, autism, Asperger's disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, sleep disorder, obesity, depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder narcolepsy, or autistic spectrum disorder. Although not wanting to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the treatment of such CNS conditions as noted above with compositions of the present technology results in increased bioavailability as compared to existing stimulant treatment modalities and dosage forms. In a preferred embodiment, the at least one prodrug or composition of the present technology is used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In some embodiments, the at least one composition or prodrug of the present technology can be used in one or more methods of treating a patient having at least one disease, disorder or condition requiring stimulation of the central nervous system of one or more patients, comprising orally administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of the at least one composition or prodrug. In some embodiments, the at least one composition or prodrug of the present technology can be used in one or more methods of treating one or more patients having at least one disease, disorder or condition mediated by controlling, preventing, limiting, or inhibiting neurotransmitter uptake/re-uptake or hormone uptake/re-uptake comprising administering to at least one patient a pharmaceutically effective amount of the at least one prodrug or composition. In some embodiments, the neurotransmitter is serotonin, dopamine or norepinephrine. In some embodiments, the hormone is catecholamine. At least some compositions of the present technology comprising the prodrugs of methylphenidate, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof, can also be used for treating stimulant (cocaine, methamphetamine) abuse and addiction, for improving battle field alertness, and/or for combating fatigue. The at least one prodrug or conjugate of the present technology can be formulated in to dosage forms to be administered orally. These dosage forms include but are not limited to tablet, capsule, caplet, troche, lozenge, powder, suspension, syrup, solution, oral thin film (OTF), oral strips, inhalation compounds or suppositories. Preferred oral administration forms are capsule, tablet, solutions and OTF. Suitable dosing vehicles of the present technology include, but are not limited to, water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 10% Tween in water, and 50% PEG-400 in water. Solid dosage forms can optionally include the following types of excipients: antiadherents, binders, coatings, disintegrants, fillers, flavors and colors, glidants, lubricants, preservatives, sorbents and sweeteners. Oral formulations of the present technology can also be included in a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid. The formulation can be an emulsion, such as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The oils can be administered by adding the purified and sterilized liquids to a prepared enteral formula, which is then placed in the feeding tube of a patient who is unable to swallow. Soft gel or soft gelatin capsules may be prepared, for example by dispersing the formulation in an appropriate vehicle (vegetable oils are commonly used) to form a high viscosity mixture. This mixture is then encapsulated with a gelatin based film using technology and machinery known to those in the soft gel industry. The individual units so formed are then dried to constant weight. Chewable tablets, for example, may be prepared by mixing the formulations with excipients designed to form a relatively soft, flavored, tablet dosage form that is intended to be chewed rather than swallowed. Conventional tablet machinery and procedures, for example, direct compression and granulation, i.e., or slugging, before compression, can be utilized. Those individuals involved in pharmaceutical solid dosage form production are versed in the processes and the machinery used, as the chewable dosage form is a very common dosage form in the pharmaceutical industry. Film coated tablets, for example may be prepared by coating tablets using techniques such as rotating pan coating methods or air suspension methods to deposit a contiguous film layer on a tablet. Compressed tablets, for example may be prepared by mixing the formulation with excipients intended to add binding qualities to disintegration qualities. The mixture is either directly compressed or granulated and then compressed using methods and machinery known to those in the industry. The resultant compressed tablet dosage units are then packaged according to market need, for example, in unit dose, rolls, bulk bottles, blister packs, etc. The present technology also contemplates the use of biologically-acceptable carriers which may be prepared from a wide range of materials. Without being limited to, such materials include diluents, binders and adhesives, lubricants, plasticizers, disintegrants, colorants, bulking substances, flavorings, sweeteners and miscellaneous materials such as buffers and adsorbents in order to prepare a particular medicated composition. Binders may be selected from a wide range of materials such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, or other suitable cellulose derivatives, povidone, acrylic and methacrylic acid co-polymers, pharmaceutical glaze, gums, milk derivatives, such as whey, starches, and derivatives, as well as other conventional binders known to persons working in the art. Exemplary non-limiting solvents are water, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, methylene chloride or mixtures and combinations thereof. Exemplary non-limiting bulking substances include sugar, lactose, gelatin, starch, and silicon dioxide. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of the present technology can include other suitable agents such as flavoring agents, preservatives and antioxidants. Such antioxidants would be food acceptable and could include vitamin E, carotene, BHT or other antioxidants. Other compounds which may be included by admixture are, for example, medically inert ingredients, e.g., solid and liquid diluents, such as lactose, dextrose, saccharose, cellulose, starch or calcium phosphate for tablets or capsules, olive oil or ethyl oleate for soft capsules and water or vegetable oil for suspensions or emulsions; lubricating agents such as silica, talc, stearic acid, magnesium or calcium stearate and/or polyethylene glycols; gelling agents such as colloidal clays; thickening agents such as gum tragacanth or sodium alginate, binding agents such as starches, arabic gums, gelatin, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or polyvinylpyrrolidone; disintegrating agents such as starch, alginic acid, alginates or sodium starch glycolate; effervescing mixtures; dyestuff; sweeteners; wetting agents such as lecithin, polysorbates or laurylsulfates; and other therapeutically acceptable accessory ingredients, such as humectants, preservatives, buffers and antioxidants, which are known additives for such formulations. For oral administration, fine powders or granules containing diluting, dispersing and/or surface-active agents may be presented in a draught, in water or a syrup, in capsules or sachets in the dry state, in a non-aqueous suspension wherein suspending agents may be included, or in a suspension in water or a syrup. Where desirable, flavoring, preserving, suspending, thickening or emulsifying agents can be included. Liquid dispersions for oral administration may be syrups, emulsions or suspensions. The syrups may contain as carrier, for example, saccharose or saccharose with glycerol and/or mannitol and/or sorbitol. In particular a syrup for diabetic patients can contain as carriers only products, for example sorbitol, which do not metabolize to glucose or which metabolize only a very small amount to glucose. The suspensions and the emulsions may contain a carrier, for example a natural gum, agar, sodium alginate, pectin, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or polyvinyl alcohol. Methylphenidate is being marketed in numerous dosage forms and at various dosage strengths either as racemic mixture of d- and l-threo-methylphenidate or as single d-threo-isomer (Table 1). Recommended daily doses depend on the dosage form, active ingredient (single isomer or racemic mixture) and individual patient titration.

Therefore dosages may be higher or lower than the dosages of free methylphenidate. Dosages can be calculated based on the strengths of dosages of methylphenidate hydrochloride which range between, for example, but not limited to, about 2.5 mg and about 54 mg per dose. Dose conversion from methylphenidate hydrochloride to methylphenidate prodrug can be performed using the following formula: dose  ( MPH   prodrug ) = f BA × dose  ( MPH   hydrochloride ) × MW  ( MPH   prodrug ) 269.77  g mol MPH=methylphenidate MW=molecular weight fBA=correction factor accounting for differences in bioavailability between unmodified methylphenidate and prodrugs of the present technology. This correction factor is specific for each prodrug. Suitable dosages of the conjugated methylphenidate or prodrugs of the present technology include, but are not limited to, formulations including an amount of conjugated methylphenidate equimolar to an amount of unconjugated methylphenidate from about 0.5 mg or higher, alternatively from about 2.5 mg or higher, alternatively from about 5.0 mg or higher, alternatively from about 7.5 mg or higher, alternatively from about 10 mg or higher, alternatively from about 20 mg or higher, alternatively from about 30 mg or higher, alternatively from about 40 mg or higher, alternatively from about 50 mg or higher, alternatively from about 60 mg or higher, alternatively from about 70 mg or higher, alternatively from about 80 mg or higher, alternatively from about 90 mg or higher, alternatively from about 100 mg or higher, and include any additional increments thereof, for example, about 0.1, about 0.2, about 0.25, about 0.3, about 0.4, about 0.5, about 0.6, about 0.7, about 0.75, about 0.8, about 0.9 or about 1.0 mg and multiplied factors thereof, (e.g., about ×1, about ×2, about ×2.5, about ×5, about ×10, about ×100, etc). The present technology also includes dosage formulations including currently approved formulations of methylphenidate (See Table 1), where the dosage can be calculated using the above-noted formula determined by the amount of methylphenidate hydrochloride. The present technology provides for dosage forms formulated as a single therapy or as a combination therapy. In some embodiments, the conjugates of methylphenidate and oxoacids to form prodrugs have one or more advantage, including, but not limited to, reduced or improved side effect profile, formation of less potentially toxic metabolites, formation of less inactive metabolites, improved water solubility, reduced drug abuse potential and/or reduced interpatient variability in plasma concentrations as compared to unconjugated methylphenidate. Synthetic Schemes In some embodiments, one or more protecting groups may be attached to any additional reactive functional groups that may interfere with the coupling to methylphenidate.
