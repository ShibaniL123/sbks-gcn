Generally speaking, the present invention relates to a piezoelectric transducer including a resonating member, a piezoelectric element bonded to the resonating member, an electrically-conductive elastic film joined to the piezoelec¬ tric element, electrical lead attachment means carried by the piezoelectric element, and at least two electrical leads, one of which is connected to the electrical lead attachment means and another of which is connected to the resonating member. A typical application for a piezoelectric transducer is to convert electrical energy into sound energy such as in an audible alarm device. One example of a device of this kind is the SONALERT electronic audible signal device produced by P.R. Mallory and Co., Inc. of Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.A. SONALERT is a registered trademark owned by P.R. Mallory & Co. Inc. In this example, a piezoelectric transducer cooperates with a solid-state amplifier drive circuit to produce an audible signal. A typical circuit for this example is an amplifier connected to function as an oscillator as is illus¬ trated in FIGURE 3 in U. S. patent 3,440,648, "Integrated- Circuit Amplifier and Oscillator", issued April 26, 1969 to H.R. Camenzind. To produce especially loud sounds, high drive pie- zoceramic material may be employed for the piezoelectric ele¬ ment in a piezoelectric transducer. The element is a disc of piezoceramic material from about .006 to .012 inch in thick¬ ness and from about .500 to 1.50 0 inches in diameter and carries a layer of metal over each face. One example of such an ele¬ ment utilizes a piezoceramic material designed as GLENNITE HDT-31 that has been formed into a disc. A layer of silver is adhered to each face of the disc. The GLENNITE HDT - 31 _1- material is piezoceramic composition that includes lead zirconate-titanate and is manufactured by Gulton Industires, Inc. of Fullerton, California, U.S.A. GLENNITE is a registered trademark owned by Gulton Industries Inc. To produce sound, this kind of piezoelectric element is bonded to a resonating member such as a metal disc from about .006 to .012 inches in thickness and from about .500 to 1.500 inches in diameter. As the piezoelectric element changes physical size in response to signals from the solid-state drive circuit, the resonating member flexes, and these flexations are transmitted to the air where they become sound. Piezoelectric elements such as the GLENNITE HDT - 31 kind perform satisfactorily in high drive self-oscillating cir¬ cuits, but are prone to early failures. The dynamic nature of a high-drive piezoelectric element and the operation of such an element at elevated temperatures tend to cause cracks in the element material and also in the thin layers of metal adhered to face of the element. These cracks isolate areas of the element from an electrical lead connected at one point on one of the layers of metal. Separated from a source of power, the isolated areas cease to be active, and the transducer becomes at least partially inoperative. In accordance with the present invention, a thin film of electrically-conductive elastic material is joined to the piezoelectric transducer. This thin film must be elas¬ tic enough to flex with the physical size changes in the pie¬ zoelectric element and at the same time be electrically con¬ ductive. In the illustrated embodiment of the present inven¬ tion, the thin film of electrically-conductive elastic material comprises a plastic material having a metal coating over at least one surface. In a more preferred embodiment of the invention the thin film is a polyester about .001 inch in thickness, with a coating of aluminum bonded to one surface. One example of this embodiment is aluminized Mylar. Mylar is a registered trademark owned by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A. The surface of the thin film having the metal coating is bonded with an electrically-conductive bonding ma¬ terial to a face of the piezoelectric element. The film in combination with the element exhibits greater flexural strength than the element alone. The film also maintains electrical connection through the metal coating and bonding material with the surface area of the layer of metal over one face of the pie- t zoelectric element in contact with the film. In the event the element and layers of metal over the surface of the element frac¬ ture, the film remains intact and the metal coating on the film maintains electrical contact to the fractured pieces so that they all continue to be piezoelectrically active. Therefore, the thin film of electrically-conductive elastic material pro¬ vides for greater structural integrity of and improved elec- trical continuity to the piezoelectric element, thereby pro¬ longing its useful life. It is, therefore, a feature of the present invention to provide a piezoelectric transducer including a thin film of electrically-conductive elastic material joined to the pie¬ zoelectric element of a piezoelectric transducer. Another feature of the present invention is to provide a piezoelectric transducer including a thin film of plastic material having a surface of electrically-conductive material bonded to a pie¬ zoelectric element. Another feature of the present invention is to provide a piezoelectric transducer including a thin film of aluminized polyester with the aluminized surface bonded to a piezoelectric element. Another feature of the present invention is to provide a piezoelectric transducer including an electrically-conductive bonding material bonding a pie¬ zoelectric element with both a resonating member and a thin film of electrically-conductive elastic material. Another feature of the present invention is to provide a piezoelectric transducer including an electrically-conductive bonding ma¬ terial bonding a thin film of aluminized polyester to a pie- zoceramic element and also bonding the piezoceramic element to a resonating member comprising a brass disc. These and other features of the invention will become more apparent from the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein: FIGURE 1 is a view of a piezoelectric transducer. FIGURE 2 is an enlarged sectional view of the pie¬ zoelectric transducer taken along a line 2-2 in FIGURE 1. Referring now to FIGURE 1, a piezoelectric trans¬ ducer 10 includes a resonating member 12, a piezoelectric element 14, a film of electrically-conductive elastic material 16, electrical lead attachment means 18 and two electrical leads 20 and 22. Resonating member 12 comprises a metal disc 24. Piezoelectric element 14 comprises a disc of piezoceramic material. Electrical lead attachment means 18 comprises two layers of metal-containing material, 26 and 27 such as silver, each layer adhered to a face of piezoelectric element 14. Layer of metal-containing material 26 carried by piezoelectric element 14 is bonded to a face of resonating member 12 with an electrically-conductive bonding material 28. Bonding ma¬ terial 28 comprises an epoxy 30 impregnated with metal par- tides 32 of a metal such as copper. The particles 3 2 are of I' sufficient size to contact both layer 26 and the face of resonating member 12. The film of electrically-conductive elastic material 16 includes a coating of electrically-conductive material 17. In the illustrated example, film 16 comprises an aluminized polyester film 34 having a polyester base 3 6 and an aluminized coating 38. Film 16 is bonded with bonding material 28 to the layer of metal-containing material 27 so that the coating of electrically-conductive material 17 is facing piezoelectric v element 14. Again the metal particles 3 2 in bonding material 28 are of sufficient size to contact both coating 17 and lay¬ er of metal-containing material 27. One electrical lead 2 0 is suitably connected to the surface of metal-containing material 27. The other electri¬ cal lead 22 is suitably connected to resonating member 12. In the illustrated example in FIGURE 2, solder 4 0 connects electrical leads 20 and 22 to piezoelectric transducer 10. In operation, a solid-state amplifier drive circuit (not shown) provides power through electrical leads 20 and 22 to piezoelectric transducer 10 causing it to resonate. Reso¬ nance or high operating temperatures sometimes cause a crack or cracks 42 to appear through piezoelectric element 14 and layers of metal 26 and 27. Power is maintained to broken pieces of piezoelectric element 14 through the coating of electrically- conductive material 17 included on the film of electrically- conductive elastic material 16.
