Synthesis of PAG Monomers
Example 6. Preparation of Monomer M-1
A 50 ml flask was charged with 2-hydroxy-2-trifluoromethylacetophenone (SM-4, 0.98 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (12 ml) under nitrogen stream. The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −30° C. before adding dropwise n-BuLi (3.0 mL, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq. 1.6 M) to the mixture over 10 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 45 minutes at −30° C. The solution was then transferred to an addition flask and added dropwise over the course of 10 minutes to a THF (12 mL) solution of 2-(chlorosulfonyl)-2,2-difluoroethyl methacrylate (Central Glass, 1.19 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) that had been equilibrated beforehand at −30° C. with stirring for 10 minutes. The combined mixture was stirred for 3 hours at −30° C. and then allowed to warm to 10° C. To the final reaction mixture was added 1N HCl (24 mL). The reaction mixture was then extracted with Et2O (72 mL) followed by 1N HCl (24 mL). The lower aqueous layer was also kept and extracted with an additional portion of Et2O (36 mL). The combined organic solution was then extracted twice with brine (24 mL) then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. Solvents were removed by an evaporator and then the crude material was triturated with CHCl3 (100 mL) that precipitated a solid that was removed by filtration. The solution was concentrated to yield a crude product that was concentrated by evaporator. The crude material was purified by column chromatography (hexane/CH2Cl2) to yield the target PAG monomer as a colorless oil (0.23 g, 11.8% yield).
