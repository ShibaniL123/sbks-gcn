WALKER APPARATUS AND BACKREST THEREFOR Field of the Invention [0001] There is provided a walker apparatus. In particular, there is provided a walker apparatus and a backrest therefor. Description of the Related Art [0002] It is known to have foldable walkers that include backrests. On the one hand, it may be desirable to provide a walker that is light weight and which includes relatively few parts. However, users with mobility issues may also have other medical deficiencies and walkers that include backrests in the form of a single band may be relatively uncomfortable for the user's back. [0003] On the other hand, walkers with large backrests, while offering more back support, may be relatively bulky and may hamper the user's ability to fold the walker. Also, such backrests may inhibit the ability of the user to see past the walker, which may be particularly dangerous for users who may already have visual impairment challenges, for example. [0004] There is accordingly a need for a backrest that promotes greater comfort to the user while at the same time not unduly hindering the foldability of the walker apparatus or impairing the user's field of vision while pushing the walker apparatus. BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION [0005] There is thus provided a walker apparatus disclosed herein that overcomes the above disadvantages. [0006] There is accordingly provided a walker apparatus having a pair of spaced- apart, upright frame members. The walker apparatus includes a seat operatively connected to the upright frame members. The walker apparatus has a backrest cantilevered from the frame members. The backrest includes a pair of spaced-apart straps. [0007] There is further provided a walker apparatus having a pair of spaced-apart, upright frame members. The walker apparatus includes a seat operatively connected to the upright frame members. The walker apparatus has a backrest cantilevered from the frame members. The backrest is horizontally-split. [0008] There is also provided a walker apparatus having a pair of spaced-apart, upright frame members. The walker apparatus includes a pair of arcuate-shaped support members extending outwards from the frame members. The walker apparatus includes a seat connected to and extending between the support members. The walker apparatus includes a pair of coupling members connecting the frame members and the support members together. Each of the coupling members has an upright tubular portion which at least partially extends around part of a respective one of the frame members. Each of the coupling members has an arcuate-shaped tubular portion which at least partially extends around part of a respective one of the support members.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0010] Referring to the drawings and first to Figure 1, there is shown a mobility aid device, in this example a walker apparatus 40 according to a first aspect. The walker apparatus is shown in Figure 1 to 21. As seen in Figure 1, the walker apparatus 40 includes a pair of spaced-apart upright, frame members 42 and 44 positioned at respective spaced-apart sides 43 and 45 of the walker apparatus adjacent the rear 47 of the walker apparatus. Each of the frame members includes a lower end and an upper end spaced- apart from the lower end, as shown by lower end 46 and upper end 48 for frame member 42. [0011] Each of the frame members 42 and 44 is telescoping and includes an inner tube 49 through which extends a plurality of apertures 51 and an outer tube 53 shaped to receive the inner tube. The walker apparatus 40 has an adjustment mechanism 59 for selectively adjusting and locking the telescoping tubes together. In this example the adjustment mechanism includes thumb screws 63. The thumb screws may be inserted through selective ones of the apertures 51 to fixedly adjust the height of the telescoping tubes 49 and 53. This enables the height of the walker apparatus 40 to be adjusted to provide an optimized height for the user 65 seen in Figure 21. [0012] Referring back to Figure 1, the walker apparatus 40 includes a pair of support members 41 and 50 which are arc-shaped in this example. The support members include proximal ends connected to respective ones of the frame members, distal ends spaced- apart the proximal ends, and apexes positioned between the ends. This is shown by support member 50 having a proximal end 52 coupled to frame member 42, a distal end 54 spaced-apart from the proximal end and an apex 55 interposed between and spaced- apart above its ends 52 and 54. The proximal ends of the support members connect to the frame members at locations adjacent to and spaced-apart from the lower ends 46 of the frame members in this example. Rods 57 extend from the lower ends 46 of respective ones of the frame members 42 and connect to respective ones of the support members 50 adjacent to the distal ends 54 of the support members in this example. [0013] The walker apparatus 40 includes a plurality of wheel assemblies rotatably connected to the lower ends of the frame members 42 and 44 and distal ends 54 of the support members 50. This is shown by wheel assembly 56 rotatably connecting to the end 46 of frame member 42. Each of the wheel assemblies includes a ground-engaging wheel 58. The walker apparatus 40 includes a collapsible basket 60 in this example. As seen in Figure 1, the basket selectively connects to and extends between the support members 41 and 50 adjacent to the distal ends 54 of the support members. The basket 60 is positioned adjacent to the front 61 of the walker apparatus in this example. The walker apparatus 40 further includes a seat assembly 62, in this example comprising a seat 64 having two substantially planar portions 66 and 68 pivotally connected together. Portions 66 and 68 of the seat assembly pivotally connect to respective ones of the support members 50 and 41 at the apexes 55 of the support members in this example. Seat 64 thus operatively connects to the upright frame members 42 and 44. [0014] As best seen in Figure 2, the walker apparatus 40 includes a folding mechanism 70. The folding mechanism includes in this example an inner frame assembly 73 formed of two inner frame members 75 and 77 which are hingedly connected together and which pivotally connect to and extend from respective ones of the rods 57. The folding mechanism 70 in this example includes a pair of intercrossing link members 79 and 81 that pivotally connect to and extend from respective portions 66 and 68 of the seat assembly 62. The link members 79 and 81 also pivotally connect to inner frame members 77 and 75, respectively of the inner frame assembly 73. The folding mechanism 70 thus operatively connects to and is interposed between frame members 42 and 44 of the walker apparatus 40. [0015] The folding mechanism is configured to selectively enable the walker apparatus to fold laterally, with the frame members 42 and 44 and support members 41 and 50 coming together thereby, as shown in Figure 13. The folding mechanism thus enables the walker apparatus 40 to be laterally-foldable along a folding axis 71 seen in Figure 13. Folding mechanism per se for walker apparatuses, including their various parts and functionings, are well known to those skilled in the art and thus folding mechanism 70 will not be described in further detail. [0016] Referring back to Figure 1, the walker apparatus 40 includes a pair of handle brake assemblies 72 and 74 that connect to and extend from respective ones of the upper ends 48 of the frame members 42 and 44. Actuation of the handle brake assemblies selectively causes at least one of the wheels 58 to brake. [0017] The walker apparatus to this point in the description is described in further detail in United States Patent No. 8,083,239 to Liu. Examples of telescoping tubes, wheel assemblies, folding mechanisms and braking assemblies for walkers per se, including their various parts and functionings, are well known to those skilled in the art and thus will not be described in further detail. [0018] Referring to Figure 1, each of the handle brake assemblies 72 and 74 includes a handle 76, actuation of which selectively causes at least one of the wheels 58 to brake. The handles are best shown in Figures 14 to 20. Each handle 76 is generally an elongate loop in shape and encloses an aperture 78 through which a user's hands may partially extend. Each handle has an elongated top potion 80 which is u-shaped in cross-section for receiving a thumb of the user. The operation of handle brake assemblies per se, including their various parts and their functionings, is well known to those skilled in the art and therefore will not be described in detail. [0019] As seen in Figure 1, each of the handle brake assemblies has a housing to which respective ones of the handles 76 pivotally connect, as shown by housing 82 for assembly 72. Referring now to Figure 10, each housing is generally a rectangular prism in shape. Each housing 82 has a proximal end 84 which operatively connects to the upper end 48 of its respective frame member 42, and a distal end 86 which is spaced-apart from its proximal end. Each housing has a pair of spaced-apart sides, including an outer side 88 and an inner side 89, each of which is generally rectangular in shape. Each housing 82 includes a rounded top 90 and flat bottom 92 in this example spaced-apart from its top. The sides 88 and 89, tops and bottoms of the housings extend from the proximal ends 84 to the distal ends 86 of the housings. The sides of the housings 82 extend from the tops 90 to the bottoms 92 of the housings. Each brake assembly 72 includes a recessed portion 94 which extends from the distal end 86 of the housing 82 towards the proximal end 84 of the housing. The recessed portion also extends downwards from the top 90 of the housing towards the bottom 92 of the housing by outer side 88 seen in Figure 10 in this example. Referring to Figure 12, the recessed portion 94 extends fully downwards from the top 90 of the housing 82 to the bottom 92 of the housing adjacent side 89 in this example. [0020] As seen in Figure 10, each handle brake assembly 72 includes a plurality of apertures extending therein at the recessed portion 94 and adjacent the outer side 88 of its housing 82. This is shown for assembly 72 by an outer aperture 96 adjacent to distal end 86 of the housing 82, an inner aperture 98 spaced-apart from aperture 96 in the direction of proximal end 84 of the housing, and an intermediate aperture 100 positioned between apertures 96 and 98. [0021] As seen in Figure 1, the walker apparatus 40 includes a backrest 102 cantilevered from the frame members 42 and 44. The backrest is flexible in this example and is arcuate-shaped when the walker apparatus is in its unfolded mode seen in Figure 1. The backrest 102, according to one aspect, comprises a pair of spaced-apart, arcuate- shaped elongate members, in this example in the form of straps including an upper strap 104 and a lower strap 106. The straps connect together at common respective ends, in this example proximal ends 108 and 110 of the backrest 102. The straps 104 and 106 extend along the front 61 and sides 43 and 45 of the walker apparatus 40 in this example. [0022] Referring to Figure 3, the backrest includes a top 112 on the upper strap 104 and a bottom 114 on lower strap 106. The top and bottom of the backrest 102 are generally arcuate or u-shaped, as seen in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. As best seen in Figure 3, the upper strap 104, as well as top 112, are u-shaped and upwardly-convex in cross-section in this example. The lower strap 106 is substantially rectangular in cross- section in this case. Referring to Figure 6, the backrest 102 includes a concave-shaped interior 116 and a convex-shaped exterior 118. As seen in Figure 3, the interior and exterior of the backrest extend from the top 112 to the bottom 114 of the backrest. [0023] The backrest 102 has an inner portion 120 which in this example is formed of polypropylene. However, this is not strictly required and other materials may be used in other embodiments. The inner portion 120 of the backrest 102 includes lower strap 106 and an inner half 122 of the upper strap 104. The inner portion 120 of the backrest is positioned within the interior 116 of the backrest. As seen in Figure 6, the inner portion 120 of the backrest and inner half 122 of the upper strap 104 are arcuate-shaped, or u- shaped in top profile in this example. Referring back to Figure 3, the inner portion of the backrest 102 has a width Wi extending from the top 112 to the bottom 114 of the backrest. The inner portion 120 of the backrest 102 is substantially rectangular in cross- section with the exception of at the top 112 of the backrest, where the inner portion at least partially curves outwards towards exterior 118 of the backrest. [0024] As seen in Figure 12, the inner portion 120 of the backrest 102, is shaped at the proximal ends 108 and 110 of the backrest to be received over recessed portions 94 of the handle brake assemblies at inner sides 89 of the housings. Referring to Figure 11, the cross-sectional thickness of the backrest 102, at its ends 108 and 110, is generally equal to the extent to which recessed portions 94 are recessed from the rest of the housings 82 of the handle brake assemblies in this example. [0025] Referring back to Figure 3, the backrest has an outer portion 124 connected to and extending outwards from its inner portion 120. The outer portion of the backrest 102 comprises an outer half 126 of the upper strap 104. The outer half 126 is positioned adjacent to the exterior 118 of the backrest. The outer portion 124 of the backrest 102 in this example is formed by thermoplastic polyurethane. However, this is not strictly required and other materials may be used in other embodiments. As seen in Figure 6, the outer portion 124 of the backrest 102 and outer half 126 of strap 104 are arcuate-shaped or u-shaped in top profile in this example. Referring back to Figure 3, the outer portion of the backrest has a width Wo extending from the top 112 of the backrest in a downwards direction to a lower peripheral edge 125 of the outer portion of the backrest. The width of the outer portion 124 of the backrest 102 is generally about half of the width Wi of the inner portion 120 of the backrest in this example. The outer portion of the backrest is substantially rectangular in cross-section with the exception of at the top 112 of the backrest, where it curves inwards towards interior 116 of the backrest and connects to the inner portion 120 of the backrest. Referring to Figure 11, the outer portion 124 of the backrest 102, at the proximal ends 108 and 110 of the backrest, is shaped to be received over recessed portions 94 of respective ones of the handle brake assemblies at sides 88. This is shown in Figure 11 by outer portion 124 at proximal end 108 of the backrest 102 being received over recessed portion 94 of assembly 72. [0026] Referring to Figure 3, the backrest 102 includes a pair of apertures, each extending through the outer portion 124 of the backrest at locations adjacent to respective ones of the proximal ends 108 and 110 of the backrest. This is seen in Figure 3 by aperture 128 extending through the outer portion 124 of the backrest adjacent proximal end 108 of the backrest. [0027] As seen with reference to Figures 1 and 10, the backrest includes an adjustment mechanism 130 that enables a user to adjust the extent to which the backrest 102 extends from the frame members 42 and 44 of the walker apparatus 40 to accommodate different body types. In this case, the adjustment mechanism includes a plurality of female connectors, in this example in the form of horizontally spaced-apart apertures 96, 98 and 100 seen in Figure 10, portions 101 of assembly 72 adjacent to said apertures, apertures 128 extending through outer portions 124 of the backrest 102 seen in Figure 11 and portions 103 of the backrest 102 adjacent to apertures 128. As seen in Figure 1 1, the adjustment mechanism 130 also includes a plurality of male connectors, in this case fasteners, in this example screws 132 which extend through respective ones of apertures 128 and engage with selectively ones of apertures 96, 98 and 100 seen in Figure 10. [0028] When the screws extend through inner apertures 98 seen in Figure 10, the backrest 102 may be in a first, retracted position, seen in Figure 11, in which the proximal ends 108 and 110 of the backrest fully extend around the recessed portions 94 of the assemblies 72 and 74. When the screws 132 seen in Figure 11 extend through outer apertures 96 seen in Figure 10, the backrest may be in a second, extended position, seen in Figure 12. The extended position of the backrest seen in Figure 12 is more spaced- apart from frame members 42 and 44 compared to the retracted position of the backrest shown in Figure 11. The backrest 102 is thus selectively connectable to a plurality of different spaced-apart positions along the handle brake assembly 72, with positioning of the straps 104 and 106 being adjustable thereby. [0029] Referring now to Figure 11, the upper strap 104 extends from the upper ends 48 of the frame members 42 and 44. As seen in Figure 4, the upper strap in this example extends in an upwardly curved manner, in this case in an upwardly-concave manner, from respective ones of the frame members. Lower strap 106 extends in this example in a downwardly curved manner, and in this case, a downwardly-concave manner. The straps 104 and 106 thus extend from the frame members 42 and 44 in outwardly divergent directions relative to each other. [0030] As best seen in Figure 12, the backrest 102 has a central portion 134 positioned between the frame members 42 and 44 of the walker apparatus 40. The straps 104 and 106 are increasingly spaced-apart away as they extend outwards from proximal ends 108 and 110 of the backrest 102 and towards the central portion 134 of the backrest. As seen in Figure 13, the straps are most spaced-apart relative to each other in a region 135 that aligns with the folding axis 71 of the walker apparatus 40. [0031] Referring Figure 21, the backrest 102 has at least one opening extending therethrough, , in this example in the form of an elongated aperture 136 for permitting a user's vision past the backrest when the user grips the upright frame members 42 and 44. This is seen by line of vision having numeral 137 extending from eyes 139 of user 65 and extending through aperture 136 to ground 141 therebelow. As seen in Figure 9, the aperture is oval-shaped in this example. The aperture 136 is positioned between the straps 104 and 106, shown in Figure 1 in this example, and extends in a substantially horizontal direction in this example. The aperture 136 has spaced-apart ends 138 and 140 which are tapered and rounded in this example. Ends 138 and 140 are positioned adjacent to proximal ends 108 and 110, respectively, of the backrest 102 in this example. As seen in Figure 1, the tapered ends of the aperture 136 and proximal ends of the backrest are positioned adjacent to the sides 43 and 45 of the walker apparatus 40. Straps 104 and 106 may be said to comprise a single backrest that is horizontally-split. [0032] The above set out structure may result in a backrest that is more compact, lighter, and more ergonomically friendly, resulting in a walker apparatus 40 that may be easier and safer to use, and easier to fold compared to walker backrests and walkers of the known prior art. [0033] Figures 22 to 24 show a walker apparatus 40.1 according to a second aspect. Like parts have like numbers and functionings as the apparatus shown in Figures 1 to 21 with the addition of decimal extension ".1". Walker apparatus 40.1 is substantially the same as walker apparatus 40 shown in Figures 1 to 21, with backrest 102.1 being cantilevered to upper ends 48.1 of frame members 42.1 and 44.1 and having an aperture 136.1 extending therethrough, but with apparatus 40.1 having the following differences. [0034] As seen in Figure 22, recessed portions 94.1 of the housings 82.1 extend from the top 90.1 to the bottom 92.1 of the housings in this example at the outer sides 88.1 thereof. Referring to Figure 23, the proximal ends of the backrest 102.1 at the exterior 118.1 of the backrest 102.1 extend over the recessed portions of the housing 82.1 from the top to the bottom of the housing, as shown by proximal end 108.1 of the backrest. [0035] As seen in Figures 22 and 24, walker apparatus 40.1 further includes a pair of slide rail assemblies connected to respective ones of the handle brake assemblies, as shown by slide rail assembly 142 for handle brake assembly 72.1. Referring to Figure 24, each slide rail assembly comprises an elongate male portion, in this example a bracket 144 which, in this example, is connected to and which extends along the proximal end 108.1 of the backrest 102.1. The brackets are t-shaped in cross-section in this example. Each slide rail assembly 142 includes an elongate female portion, in this example in the form of a recess 146, which, in this example, extends parallel to and inwards from side 88.1 of housing 82.1 adjacent to recessed portion 94.1 of the housing. Each recess 146 is positioned adjacent to and is spaced-apart from bottom 92.1 of its housing in this example. Each recess 146 is shaped to slidably receive bracket 144 and is T-shaped in cross-section in this example, as seen in Figure 22. The backrest 102.1 thus connects to and is extendable from the frame members 42.1 via the slide rail assemblies 142. Alternatively, brackets 144 may connect to the housing 82.1 and an elongate female portion may connect to, or alternatively, be a part of the proximal ends 108.1 of the backrest 102.1. [0036] Figures 25 to 33 show a walker apparatus 40.2 according to a third aspect. Like parts have like numbers and functionings as the apparatus shown in Figures 1 to 21 with the addition of decimal extension ".2". Walker apparatus 40.2 is generally similar to walker apparatus 40 shown in Figures 1 to 21, with backrest 102.2 being cantilevered to upper ends 48.2 of frame members 42.2 and 44.2 and having an aperture 136.2 extending therethrough, but with the apparatus having the following differences. [0037] In this case, as best seen in Figure 33, straps 104.2 and 106.2 extend along the front 61.2 of the walker apparatus. Referring to Figure 25, the backrest 102.2 includes a cushioning member 148 located at and positioned within the concave-shaped interior 116.2 of the backrest. The cushioning member has an aperture 149 that coincides with and is coextensive with aperture 136.2 of the backrest. Ends 138.2 and 140.2 of aperture 136.2 are inwardly spaced-apart from proximal ends 108.2 and 110.2 of the backrest 102.2 and frame members 42.2 and 44.2. Backrest 102.2, straps 104.2 and 106.2 and aperture 136.2 are substantially symmetrical about the vertical, central axis 150 of the backrest and are substantially symmetrical about the horizontal axis 152 of the backrest in this case. The horizontal axis of the backrest and the upper ends 48.2 of the frame members 42.2 and 44.2 of walker apparatus 40.2 align within a horizontal plane 153 in this example. Strap 104.2 extends upwards from the horizontal plane in this example and strap 106.2 extends downwards from the horizontal plane as the straps extend towards the central portion 134.2 of the backrest. [0038] Figures 34 and 35 show a walker apparatus 40.3 according to a fourth aspect. Like parts have like numbers and functionings as the apparatus shown in Figures 1 to 21 with the addition of decimal extension ".3". Walker apparatus 40.3 is generally similar to walker apparatus 40 shown in Figures 1 to 21, with backrest 102.3 being cantilevered to upper ends 48.3 of frame members 42.3 and 44.3 and having an aperture 136.3 extending therethrough, but with the apparatus having the following differences. [0039] In this case, as seen in Figure 34, the straps 104.3 and 106.3 extend outwards from the frame members 42.3 of the walker apparatus 40.3 in an elliptical manner. In this example, the backrest 102.3 is y-shaped when viewed from the side as it extends from the frame members. Similar to the backrest 102.2 shown in Figures 25 to 33, backrest 102.3, straps 104.3 and 106.3 and aperture 136.3 are substantially symmetrical about the vertical, central axis 150.3 of the backrest and are substantially symmetrical about the horizontal axis 152.3 of the backrest in this case. [0040] The walker apparatus 40.3 includes a height-adjustment mechanism 59.3 for selectively adjusting and locking telescoping tubes 49.3 and 53.3 together. In this example and as best seen in Figure 35, the adjustment mechanism includes a push button 154, instead of a thumb screw, for selecting coupling the tubes together and thus adjusting the height of the walker apparatus.
