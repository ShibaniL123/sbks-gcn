DETAILED DESCRIPTION A non-naturally occurring porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) genome was designed using a large set of genomic sequences of PRRSV isolates, which represents the widest genetic diversity of PRRSV strains circulating in U.S. swine herds. The non-naturally occurring PRRSV genome was designed so that it has a high degree of genetic similarity to the PRRSV field-isolates studied when compared to any single, naturally occurring PRRSV strain. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important diseases in swine. Clinical signs of the disease include reproductive failure in pregnant sows and respiratory disorder in young pigs. The disease is more severe when animals are co-infected with other pathogens. The annual loss to the US swine industry was estimated to be about $560 million in 2005 and about $640 million in 2011. The causative agent of PRRS is an RNA virus named PRRS virus (PRRSV). PRRSV is classified into two major genotypes: European (Type 1) and North American (Type 2). There is limited cross-protection between these two genotypes. Considerable genetic variation exists among PRRSV isolates within each of these genotypes. Importantly, genetic divergence has been shown to occur when a PRRSV strain is serially passed from pig to pig. This leads to co-circulation of multiple PRRSV variants within one herd or even within one animal that is persistently infected with PRRSV. PRRSV vaccines have been in use since 1994. There are two types of PRRSV vaccines currently available in the market; modified-live and inactivated vaccines. In addition, several subunit vaccines against PRRSV are being tested in different laboratories worldwide, but none have been licensed for clinical application. Currently, PRRSV vaccines are prepared using naturally occurring PRRSV strains as the vaccine immunogens. The current PRRSV vaccines are not adequately effective for control and eradication of PRRS; they provide acceptable levels of homologous protection but they fail to provide consistent heterologous cross-protection. Extensive genetic diversity among PRRSV isolates is the main reason behind the sub-optimal heterologous protection of the current PRRSV vaccines. The non-naturally occurring PRRSV-CON described herein confers superior cross-protective against different heterologous PRRSV strains, as compared to the PRRSV wild type strain FL12. Thus, the PRRSV-CON described herein can be used to formulate a universal PRRSV vaccine. In addition, the PRRSV-CON described herein provides an important tool to study the mechanism of heterologous protection against divergent PRRSV strains. Nucleic Acids and Polypeptides The PRRSV genome encodes at least 22 proteins; 14 non-structural proteins and 8 structural proteins. A nucleic acid is provided herein that encodes for a non-naturally occurring PRRSV. See SEQ ID NO: l for the genomic sequence of PRRSV-CON. The non-naturally occurring PRRSV described herein possesses the highest degree of genetic identity with the naturally occurring PRRSV isolates. The PRRSV-CON genomic nucleic acid provided herein (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 1) encodes for a number of different polypeptides. For example, the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 3; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:4 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:6 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:7; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:8 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:9; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 10 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 13; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 14 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 17; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 18 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 19; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:20 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:21; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:22 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:23; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:24 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 25; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 26 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 27; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:28 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 29; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:30 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:31; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:32 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:33; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:34 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:35; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 36 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:37; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:38 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 39; the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 40 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:41; and the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:42 encodes for the polypeptide sequence having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:43. As used herein, nucleic acids can include DNA and RNA, and includes nucleic acids that contain one or more nucleotide analogs or backbone modifications. A nucleic acid can be single stranded or double stranded, which usually depends upon its intended use. Nucleic acids and polypeptides that differ from SEQ ID NOs: 1-43 also are provided. Nucleic acids that differ in sequence from SEQ ID NO: 1 or any of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, or 42 can have at least 80% sequence identity (e.g., at least 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity) to SEQ ID NO: 1 or any of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, or 42. Polypeptides that differ in sequence from any of SEQ ID NOs:3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41 or 43, can have at least 80% sequence identity (e.g., at least 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity) to any of SEQ ID NOs:3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41 or 43. In calculating percent sequence identity, two sequences are aligned and the number of identical matches of nucleotides or amino acid residues between the two sequences is determined. The number of identical matches is divided by the length of the aligned region (i.e., the number of aligned nucleotides or amino acid residues) and multiplied by 100 to arrive at a percent sequence identity value. It will be appreciated that the length of the aligned region can be a portion of one or both sequences up to the full-length size of the shortest sequence. It also will be appreciated that a single sequence can align with more than one other sequence and hence, can have different percent sequence identity values over each aligned region. The alignment of two or more sequences to determine percent sequence identity can be performed using the computer program ClustalW and default parameters, which allows alignments of nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences to be carried out across their entire length (global alignment). Chenna et al, 2003, Nucleic Acids Res., 31(13):3497- 500. ClustalW calculates the best match between a query and one or more subject sequences, and aligns them so that identities, similarities and differences can be determined. Gaps of one or more residues can be inserted into a query sequence, a subject sequence, or both, to maximize sequence alignments. For fast pairwise alignment of nucleic acid sequences, the default parameters can be used (i.e., word size: 2; window size: 4; scoring method: percentage; number of top diagonals: 4; and gap penalty: 5); for an alignment of multiple nucleic acid sequences, the following parameters can be used: gap opening penalty: 10.0; gap extension penalty: 5.0; and weight transitions: yes. For fast pairwise alignment of polypeptide sequences, the following parameters can be used: word size: 1; window size: 5; scoring method: percentage; number of top diagonals: 5; and gap penalty: 3. For multiple alignment of polypeptide sequences, the following parameters can be used: weight matrix: blosum; gap opening penalty: 10.0; gap extension penalty: 0.05; hydrophilic gaps: on; hydrophilic residues: Gly, Pro, Ser, Asn, Asp, Gin, Glu, Arg, and Lys; and residue-specific gap penalties: on. ClustalW can be run, for example, at the Baylor College of Medicine Search Launcher website or at the European Bioinformatics Institute website on the World Wide Web. Changes can be introduced into a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 or any of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, or 42), thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptide (e.g., SEQ ID NOs:3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41 or 43). For example, changes can be introduced into nucleic acid coding sequences using mutagenesis (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis, PCR-mediated mutagenesis) or by chemically synthesizing a nucleic acid molecule having such changes. Such nucleic acid changes can lead to conservative and/or non-conservative amino acid substitutions at one or more amino acid residues. A "conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which one amino acid residue is replaced with a different amino acid residue having a similar side chain (see, for example, Dayhoff et al. (1978, in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, 5(Suppl. 3):345-352), which provides frequency tables for amino acid substitutions), and a non-conservative substitution is one in which an amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue that does not have a similar side chain. As used herein, an "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is free of sequences that naturally flank one or both ends of the nucleic acid in the genome of the organism from which the isolated nucleic acid molecule is derived (e.g., a cDNA or genomic DNA fragment produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease digestion). Such an isolated nucleic acid molecule is generally introduced into a vector (e.g., a cloning vector, or an expression vector) for convenience of manipulation or to generate a fusion nucleic acid molecule, discussed in more detail below. In addition, an isolated nucleic acid molecule can include an engineered nucleic acid molecule such as a recombinant or a synthetic nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a "purified" polypeptide is a polypeptide that has been separated or purified from cellular components that naturally accompany it. Typically, the polypeptide is considered "purified" when it is at least 70% (e.g., at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99%) by dry weight, free from the polypeptides and naturally occurring molecules with which it is naturally associated. Since a polypeptide that is chemically synthesized is, by nature, separated from the components that naturally accompany it, a synthetic polypeptide is "purified." Nucleic acids can be isolated using techniques routine in the art. For example, nucleic acids can be isolated using any method including, without limitation, recombinant nucleic acid technology, and/or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). General PCR techniques are described, for example in PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, Dieffenbach & Dveksler, Eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995. Recombinant nucleic acid techniques include, for example, restriction enzyme digestion and ligation, which can be used to isolate a nucleic acid. Isolated nucleic acids also can be chemically synthesized, either as a single nucleic acid molecule or as a series of oligonucleotides. Polypeptides can be purified from natural sources (e.g., a biological sample) by known methods such as DEAE ion exchange, gel filtration, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. A polypeptide also can be purified, for example, by expressing a nucleic acid in an expression vector. In addition, a purified polypeptide can be obtained by chemical synthesis. The extent of purity of a polypeptide can be measured using any appropriate method, e.g., column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or HPLC analysis. A vector containing a nucleic acid (e.g., a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide) also is provided. Vectors, including expression vectors, are commercially available or can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques routine in the art. A vector containing a nucleic acid can have expression elements operably linked to such a nucleic acid, and further can include sequences such as those encoding a selectable marker (e.g., an antibiotic resistance gene). A vector containing a nucleic acid can encode a chimeric or fusion polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide operatively linked to a heterologous polypeptide, which can be at either the N-terminus or C-terminus of the polypeptide). Representative heterologous polypeptides are those that can be used in purification of the encoded polypeptide (e.g., 6xHis tag, glutathione S-transferase (GST)) Expression elements include nucleic acid sequences that direct and regulate expression of nucleic acid coding sequences. One example of an expression element is a promoter sequence. Expression elements also can include introns, enhancer sequences, response elements, or inducible elements that modulate expression of a nucleic acid. Expression elements can be of bacterial, yeast, insect, mammalian, or viral origin, and vectors can contain a combination of elements from different origins. As used herein, operably linked means that a promoter or other expression element(s) are positioned in a vector relative to a nucleic acid in such a way as to direct or regulate expression of the nucleic acid (e.g., in-frame). Many methods for introducing nucleic acids into host cells, both in vivo and in vitro, are well known to those skilled in the art and include, without limitation, electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, polyethylene glycol (PEG) transformation, heat shock, lipofection, microinjection, and viral-mediated nucleic acid transfer. Vectors as described herein can be introduced into a host cell. As used herein, "host cell" refers to the particular cell into which the nucleic acid is introduced and also includes the progeny of such a cell that carry the vector. A host cell can be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example, nucleic acids can be expressed in bacterial cells such as E. coli, or in insect cells, yeast or mammalian cells (such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or COS cells). Other suitable host cells are known to those skilled in the art. Nucleic acids can be detected using any number of amplification techniques (see, e.g., PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, 1995, Dieffenbach & Dveksler, Eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683, 195; 4,683,202; 4,800, 159; and 4,965,188) with an appropriate pair of oligonucleotides (e.g., primers). A number of modifications to the original PCR have been developed and can be used to detect a nucleic acid. Nucleic acids also can be detected using hybridization. Hybridization between nucleic acids is discussed in detail in Sambrook et al. (1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Sections 7.37-7.57, 9.47-9.57, 11.7-11.8, and 11.45-11.57). Sambrook et al. discloses suitable Southern blot conditions for oligonucleotide probes less than about 100 nucleotides (Sections 11.45-11.46). The Tm between a sequence that is less than 100 nucleotides in length and a second sequence can be calculated using the formula provided in Section 11.46. Sambrook et al. additionally discloses Southern blot conditions for oligonucleotide probes greater than about 100 nucleotides (see Sections 9.47-9.54). The Tm between a sequence greater than 100 nucleotides in length and a second sequence can be calculated using the formula provided in Sections 9.50-9.51 of Sambrook et al. The conditions under which membranes containing nucleic acids are prehybridized and hybridized, as well as the conditions under which membranes containing nucleic acids are washed to remove excess and non-specifically bound probe, can play a significant role in the stringency of the hybridization. Such hybridizations and washes can be performed, where appropriate, under moderate or high stringency conditions. For example, washing conditions can be made more stringent by decreasing the salt concentration in the wash solutions and/or by increasing the temperature at which the washes are performed. Simply by way of example, high stringency conditions typically include a wash of the membranes in 0.2X SSC at 65°C. In addition, interpreting the amount of hybridization can be affected, for example, by the specific activity of the labeled oligonucleotide probe, by the number of probe- binding sites on the template nucleic acid to which the probe has hybridized, and by the amount of exposure of an autoradiograph or other detection medium. It will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that although any number of hybridization and washing conditions can be used to examine hybridization of a probe nucleic acid molecule to immobilized target nucleic acids, it is more important to examine hybridization of a probe to target nucleic acids under identical hybridization, washing, and exposure conditions. Preferably, the target nucleic acids are on the same membrane. A nucleic acid molecule is deemed to hybridize to a nucleic acid but not to another nucleic acid if hybridization to a nucleic acid is at least 5-fold (e.g., at least 6- fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 50-fold, or 100-fold) greater than hybridization to another nucleic acid. The amount of hybridization can be quantitated directly on a membrane or from an autoradiograph using, for example, a Phosphorlmager or a Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Polypeptides can be detected using antibodies. Techniques for detecting polypeptides using antibodies include enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), Western blots, immunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence. An antibody can be polyclonal or monoclonal. An antibody having specific binding affinity for a polypeptide can be generated using methods well known in the art. The antibody can be attached to a solid support such as a microtiter plate using methods known in the art. In the presence of a polypeptide, an antibody-polypeptide complex is formed. Detection (e.g., of an amplification product, a hybridization complex, or a polypeptide) is usually accomplished using detectable labels. The term "label" is intended to encompass the use of direct labels as well as indirect labels. Detectable labels include enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, and radioactive materials. Methods of Making and Using a PRRSV-CON Virus Particle Methods of constructing a virus particle from a PRRSV-CON nucleic acid are known in the art and are described herein. As demonstrated herein, the PRRSV-CON described herein self-assembles into particles when appropriately expressed. The PRRSV-CON can be expressed in vitro or in vivo, for example, in a host cell. In some embodiments, a host cell can be transfected with the PRRSV-CON nucleic acid, or a host cell can be infected with a PRRSV-CON virus particle. Host cells can be, without limitation, porcine cells (e.g., porcine alveolar macrophage) or African green monkey kidney-derived cells (e.g., MARC-145). Virus particles can be isolated, for example, by ultracentrifugation. The PRRSV-CON nucleic acids, polypeptides or virus particles described herein can be used to generate, enhance or modulate the immune response of a porcine. Such methods typically include administering a PRRSV-CON nucleic acid, polypeptide or virus particle described herein to a porcine in an amount sufficient to generate an immune response. As used herein, an "immune response" refers to the reaction elicited in an individual following administration of a PRRSV-CON nucleic acid, polypeptide or virus particle as described herein. Immune responses can include, for example, an antibody response or a cellular response (e.g., a cytotoxic T-cell response). A PRRSV-CON nucleic acid, polypeptide or virus particle can be used to prevent PRRS in porcine, e.g., as a prophylactic vaccine, or to establish or enhance immunity to PRRS in a healthy individual prior to exposure or contraction of PRRS, thus preventing the disease or reducing the severity of disease symptoms. Methods for administering a PRRSV-CON nucleic acid, polypeptide or virus particle to a porcine include, without limitation, intramuscular (i.m.), subcutaneous (s.c), or intrapulmonary routes. Methods for administering a PRRSV-CON nucleic acid, polypeptide or virus particle to a porcine also include, without limitation, intratracheal, transdermal, intraocular, intranasal, inhalation, intracavity, and intravenous (i.v.) administration. Determining an effective amount of a PRRSV-CON nucleic acid, polypeptide or virus particle depends upon a number of factors including, for example, whether the antigen is being expressed or administered directly, the age and weight of the subject, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, and the route of administration. Based on the above factors, determining the amount and the dosing (e.g., the number of doses and the timing of doses) are within the level of skill of an ordinary artisan. A composition can include a PRRSV-CON nucleic acid, polypeptide or virus particle as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are known in the art and include, for example, buffers (e.g., phosphate buffered saline (PBS), normal saline, Tris buffer, and sodium phosphate) or diluents. The compositions described herein can be formulated as an aqueous solution, or as an emulsion, gel, solution, suspension, or powder. See, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Ed., Osol, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1980), and Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 19th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1995). In addition to a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, the compositions described herein also can include binders, stabilizers, preservatives, salts, excipients, delivery vehicles and/or auxiliary agents. In accordance with the present invention, there may be employed conventional molecular biology, microbiology, biochemical, and recombinant DNA techniques within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the methods and compositions of matter described in the claims. EXAMPLES Example 1— Computational Design of the Artificial PRRSV-CON Genome Full-genome sequences of 64 PRRSV isolates originating from the Midwestern states (Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois) of the U.S. were sequenced using the Roche 454-GS- FLX sequencing technology. In addition, more than 20 full-genome sequences of PRRSV isolates originating from the U.S. were collected from GenBank. After removing redundant sequences, a final set of 60 full-genome sequences of PRRSV was attained. The 60 PRRSV full-genome sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program (Edgar RC, 2004, BMC Bioinform., 5: 113). After that, a consensus genome sequence (PRRSV- CON) was generated by selecting the most common nucleotide found at each position of the viral genome, using the Jalview program. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the PRRSV-CON genome locates right at the center of the phylogenetic tree. See Figure 1A. Consequently, the pairwise genetic distance from PRRSV-CON to the naturally occurring PRRSV strains is significantly shorter than the distance from any one naturally occurring PRRSV strains to each other (p<0.0001). See Figure IB. Example 2— Generation of an Infectious PRRSV-CON Virus It is generally difficult to accurately determine the sequence at 5 ' and 3 ' ends of a viral genome. Thus, we realized that the sequences at the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the naturally occurring PRRSV genomes analyzed in Example 1 may not be accurate. To increase the change of recovering infectious virus, we replaced the 5' and 3 'UTRs of the PRRSV-CON genome with the 5' and 3' UTRs of the infectious cDNA clone FL12 (Truong et al., 2004, Virology, 325:308-19). Four DNA fragments, designated A-D, encompassing the entire PRRSV-CON genome, were chemically synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ). Each DNA fragment was flanked by a pair of restriction enzyme sites to facilitate the cloning purposes. The T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was incorporated into fragment D, preceding the viral 5'end, to facilitate the in vitro transcription of the viral genome. See Figure 2A. Individual DNA fragments were sequentially cloned into the shuttle vector that carries the corresponding restriction enzyme site, following the order from fragment A to fragment D. Once the full-length PRRSV-CON cDNA clone was generated, standard reverse genetics techniques were applied to recover viable PRRSV-CON viruses. Briefly, the plasmid containing full-length cDNA genome of PRRSV-CON was digested with Acll for linearization. The purified, linear DNA fragment was used as the template for an in vitro transcription reaction using the mMESSAGEmMA CHINE Ultra T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) to generate full genome viral RNA transcripts. After that, about 5 μg of the full-genome RNA transcripts were transfected into MARC- 145 cells cultured in a 6-well plate, using the TransIT®-mRNA Transfection Kit (Minis Bio, Madison, WI). Transfected cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37°C, 5% C02 for up to 6 days. Typically, cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed between day 4 and day 6 after transfection. When clear CPE was observed, culture supernatant containing the rescued virus was collected and stored in 0.5 mL aliquots in a 80°C freezer. See, Truong et al. (2004, supra) Example 3— In Vitro Characterization of the PRRSV-CON Virus To study the reactivity with different PRRSV-specific monoclonal antibodies, MARC-145 cells were mock infected or infected with the PRRSV-CON virus or the PRRSV strain FL12. At 48 hours post-infection (p.i.), the cells were immunostained with antibodies specific to the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein or the viral nonstructural protein 1 beta (nsplb). To study the growth kinetics of the viruses in cell culture, MARC-145 cells were infected with the PRRSV-CON or FL12 at a multiplicity of infection (MO I) of 0.01. At different time-points p.i., culture supernatant was collected and viral titers were determined by titration in MARC- 145 cells. The PRRSV-CON virus displays typical in vitro characterizations of a naturally occurring PRRSV strain. It reacts with different PRRSV-specific monoclonal antibodies including antibodies against nspl-betta and N protein (Figure 2B). It replicates efficiently in cell culture (Figure 2C), and it is able to form clear and distinct plaque morphology (Figure 3D). Example 4— The PRRSV-CON Virus Can Infect Pigs as Efficiently as the Natural PRRSV Strain A total of 18 PRRSV-seronegative, 3 week-old pigs were purchased from the University of Nebraska research farm. The pigs were randomly assigned into 3 experimental groups; each group was housed in a separate room in the Biosecurity Level - 2 Animal Research Facilities at UNL, following the regulations established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Pigs in group 1 were injected with PBS to act as the control. Pigs in groups 2 and 3 were inoculated intramuscularly with 105 0 TCIDso of PRRSV-CON and PRRSV strain FL12, respectively. The wild-type PRRSV strain, FL12, was included into this study for comparison purposes. The results are shown in Figure 3. After infection, both of the PRRSV-CON and FL12-inoculated groups displayed significantly higher temperature than PBS-group (Figure 3A), but there was no difference in temperature between PRRSV-CON -inoculated group and the FL12- inoculated group. Average daily weight gain (ADWG) was measured for each individual pig during the period of 14 days after infection. No statistical difference was observed among the three treatment groups, although pigs in the PRRSV-CON-inoculated group and the FL12-inoculated group tended to have lower ADWG than the PBS group (Figure 3B). Viremia levels of the PRRSV-CON- and FL12-inoculated groups were almost identical (Figure 3C). All pigs in the PRRSV-CON- and FL12-inoculated groups were seroconverted by 11 days p.i. The level of antibody response in the PRRSV-CON- inoculated group was slightly lower than that of the FL12-inoculated group (Figure 3D). These results demonstrate that the PRRSV-CON can infect the natural host (i.e., pigs) as efficiently as the PRRSV strain, FL12. Example 5— Evaluation of the Level of Cross-Protection Against PRRSV Strain MN-184 Materials and methods A total of 18 PRRSV-seronegative, 3 week-old pigs were purchased from the University of Nebraska research farm. The pigs were randomly assigned into 3 experimental groups; each group was housed in a separate room in the Biosecurity Level - 2 Animal Research Facilities at UNL, following the regulations established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Group 1 was injected with PBS and served as the non-immunization control. Group 2 was immunized by infection, intramuscularly, with PRRSV-CON at the dose of 104 0 TCID50 per pig. Group 3 was immunized by infection, intramuscularly, with the wild-type PRRSV strain, FL12, at the dose of 104 0 TCID50 per pig. See Table 1. At 53 days post-infection (p.i.), all control and immunized pigs were challenged, intramuscularly, with PRRSV strain MN-184 at a dose of 105 0 TCID50. Parameters used to evaluate protection by immunization with the PRRSV-CON virus included viremia and viral load in several different tissues as well as growth performance. Table 1 : Experimental Design to Evaluate Level of Cross-Protection Against PRRSV To measure growth performance, each pig was weighed right before challenge infection and 15 days post-challenge. Body weight was recorded in pounds. Average daily weight gain (ADWG) was calculated for the period of 15 days post-challenge. To quantitate levels of viremia after challenge infection, blood samples were taken before challenge and at days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 15 post-challenge. Serum samples were extracted from each individual blood samples and stored in a -80°C freezer. Viremia levels were quantitated by the Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory, South Dakota State University, using the universal RT-qPCR kit (Tetracore Inc., Rockville, MD). Results were reported as log 10 copy/mL. For statistical purposes, samples that had undetected level of viral RNA were assigned a value of 0 log 10 copy/mL. To quantitate levels of viral load in tissues, pigs were humanely sacrificed and necropsied on day 15 post-challenge. Samples of tonsil, lung, mediastinal lymph node and inguinal lymph node were obtained and kept individually in Whirl -pak® bags. The samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen right after collection. After that, they were stored in a -80°C freezer. To extract RNA, tissue samples were homogenized in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with a ratio of 300 mg tissue in 3 mL Trizol reagent. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. RNA concentration was quantitated by the NanoDrop®ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE) and adjusted to a final concentration of 200 ng^L. It has been well characterized that PRRSV can colonize and persist in lymphoid tissues of infected pigs up to 150 days post-infection. In these experiments, the tissue viral load was evaluated at 15 days post-challenge, which corresponds to 67 days after the primary infection. At that time, it is likely that the pigs in the PRRSV-CON and FL12 groups still contained residual virus of the primary infection. Therefore, we used two different RT-PCR kits to quantify the viral RNA load in tissues: (i) the commercial RT- qPCR kit (Tetracore Inc., Rockville, MD) that detects total viral RNA resulting from both the primary infection and the challenge infection, and (ii) the differential RT-PCR developed in-house that selectively detects only viral RNA from challenge infection. Five of each RNA sample (equivalent to 1 μg RNA) was used for each RT-qPCR reaction. Results were reported as log 10 copy^g of total RNA. For statistical purposes, samples that had undetected viral RNA level were assigned a value of 0 log RNA copy/1 μg of total RNA. Results The results of growth performance are presented in Figure 4A. The mean ADWG of PBS-, PRRSV-CON- and FL12-immunized groups were 0.3 lbs (SD +/- 0.3), 0.9 lbs (SD +/- 0.6), and 1.2 lbs (SD+/- 0.4), respectively. PRRSV-CON and FL12-immunized groups had greater ADWG than the PBS-immunized group. There was no statistical difference between the PRRSV-CON- and FL12-immunized groups. The viremia levels after challenge infection are shown in Figure 4B and Table 2. All pigs in the PBS-immunized group were viremic at all timepoints tested. The PRRSV- CON-immunized group only had 3 viremic pigs, of which 1 pig was viremic at 2 timepoints (pig # 494 at 4 DPC and 7 DPC) and 2 pigs were viremic at only one timepoint (pigs # 394 and 495 at 15 DPC). The remaining 3 pigs in this group (pigs # 345, 410 and 459) were not viremic after challenge infection. By contrast, viremia was detected in 5 out of 6 pigs in the FL12-immunized group at two time-points or more after challenge infection. There was only 1 pig in this group (pig # 440) that was not viremic at any time-point tested. Overall, the viremia level of PRRSV-CON-immunized pigs was significantly lower than that in the FL12-immunized group (p<0.05) and the PBS- immunized group (p<0.0001). The results of total viral RNA quanititated by the universal RT-qPCR kit are shown in Figure 4C. The PRRSV-CON- and FL12-immunized groups contained significantly lower levels of total viral RNA than the PBS-immunized group, regardless of the tissue types tested. However, there was no difference between the PRRSV-CON- and FL12-immunized groups in term of total viral RNA. The results of MN-184 specific RNA quantitated by the differential RT-qPCR are shown in Figure 4D. All pigs in PBS-immunized group carried MN-184 RNA in their tissues. Four pigs in the FL12-immunized group had MN-184 RNA in their tonsil and mediastinal lymph node, whereas 5 pigs in this group had MN-184 RNA in their inguinal lymph node. Remarkably, none of the pigs in the PRRSV-CON-immunized group had detectable level of MN-184 RNA in any of the tissue samples tested. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that immunization of weaning pigs by infection with the non-naturally occurring PRRSV-CON resulted in significantly better cross-protection against challenge with PRRSV strain, MN-184, than did immunization with the PRRSV strain, FL12. Table 2. Viremia After Challenge Infection (log 10 copy/mL) Example 6— Evaluation of the Level of Cross-Protection Against PR SV Strain 16244B Materials and methods The experimental design was the same as described above in Example 5. A total of 18 PRRSV-seronegative, 3 week-old pigs purchased from the UNL research farm were randomly assigned into 3 experimental groups. Each group was housed in a separate room at the Biosecurity Level -2 Animal Research Facilities at UNL, following the regulations established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Group 1 was injected with PBS and acted as the control. Group 2 was immunized, intramuscularly, by infection with PRRSV-CON at the dose of 104 0 TCID50 per pig. Group 3 was immunized, intramuscularly, by infection with the wild type PRRSV, FL12, at the dose of 104 0 TCID50 per pig. See Table 3. One pig in group 3 (pig # 543) and one pig in group 2 (pig # 435) were removed from this study on 14 and 23 days after primary infection, respectively, due to lameness in their legs. At day 52 post-infection (p.i.), all pigs were challenged, intramuscularly, with PRRSV strain 16244B at the challenge dose of 105 0 TCID50. Parameters used to evaluate protection by immunization with the PRRSV-CON virus, including viremia and viral load in various tissues as well as growth performance, were measured as described above in Example 5. Table 3. Experimental Design to Evaluate Level of Cross-Protection Against PRRSV Strain 16244B Results The results of growth performance are shown in Figure 5A. Mean ADWG of PBS-, PRRSV-CON-, and FL12-immunized groups were 1.1 lbs (SD +/- 0.3), 1.6 lbs (SD +/- 0.1), and 0.8 lbs (SD+/- 0.3), respectively. The PRRSV-CON-immunized group had greater ADWG than the PBS-immunized group and the FL12-immunized group; whereas the FL12-immunized group was not statistically different from the PBS-immunized group. The results of viremia levels after challenge infection are shown in Figure 5B and Table 4. All pigs in the PBS-immunized group were viremic at all timepoints tested. Two out of 5 pigs in the PRRSV-CON-immunized group (pigs # 442 and 445) did not resolve viremia at 52 days after primary infection as viral RNA was still detected in their serum samples collected at this timepoint. After challenge infection, 3 pigs in the PRRSV-CON-immunized group were viremic at only 1 timepoint. The remaining 2 pigs in this group (pigs # 436 and 438) were not viremic throughout the period of 15 days post-challenge. By contrast, all pigs in the FL12-immunized group resolved viremia by 52 days post-primary infection. After challenge infection, all pigs in this group became viremic. Overall, the viremia level of the PRRSV-CON-immunized group was significantly lower than that of the FL12-immunized group (pO.0001) or the PBS- immunized group (p<0.0001). The results of total viral RNA quantitated by the commercial RT-qPCR kit (Tetracore Inc., Rockville, MD) are shown in Figure 5C. Both the PRRSV-CON- and FL12-immunized groups contained significantly lower levels of total viral RNA than the PBS-immunized group, regardless of the tissue types tested. However, there was no statistical difference between the PRRSV-CON-immunized group and the FL12- immunized group in terms of total viral RNA. The results of 16244B -specific RNA quantitated by the differential RT-qPCR are shown in Figure 5D. All pigs in the PBS- and FL12-immunized groups carried 16244B- specific RNA in their tissues, although the levels of 16244B RNA in the FL12- immunized group was lower than those in the PBS-immunized group. By contrast, only 1 pig in the PRRSV-CON-immunized group carried 16244B -specific RNA in its inguinal lymph node, while the remaining 4 pigs in this group did not carry 16244B-specific RNA. All together, these results clearly demonstrate that immunization of weaning pigs by infection with the non-naturally occurring PRRSV-CON resulted in significantly better cross-protection against challenge with PRRSV strain, 16244B, than did immunization with the PRRSV strain, FL12.
