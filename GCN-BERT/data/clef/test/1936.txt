LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES Heuchera VARIETY DENOMINATION ‘DKIRA88’ BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The new Heuchera cultivar is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventor, Gavriel Danziger, in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel. The objective of the breeding program was to produce new Heuchera varieties for ornamental commercial applications. The cross resulting in this new variety was made during February of 2009. The seed parent is the unpatented, proprietary variety referred to as Heuchera ‘HU-8-149. The pollen parent is the unpatented, proprietary variety referred to as Heuchera ‘HU-8-116’. The new variety was discovered in November of 2009 by the inventor in a group of seedlings resulting from the 2009 crossing, in a research greenhouse in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar was performed by vegetative cuttings. This was first performed at a research greenhouse in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel in November of 2009 and has shown that the unique features of this cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type in more than 50 successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The cultivar ‘DKIRA88’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, day length, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘DKIRA88’ These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘DKIRA88’ as a new and distinct Heuchera cultivar: 1. Compact and mounded plant habit.2. Greyed-orange to greyed-green leaf with red-purple venation.3. Rapid growth rate. Plants of the new cultivar ‘DKIRA88’ are similar to plants of the seed parent, Heuchera ‘HU-8149’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘DKIRA88’ differs in the following; 1. Foliage is greyed-orange. The seed parent foliage is red-silver.2. Fuller plant body structure. Plants of the new cultivar ‘DKIRA88’ are similar to plants of the pollen parent; Heuchera ‘HU-8-116’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘DKIRA88’ differs in the following; 1. Foliage is greyed-orange. The pollen parent foliage is green-orange.2. Fuller plant body structure.3. Flowers are red-white; flowers of pollen parent are pink-white. COMMERCIAL COMPARISON Plants of the new cultivar ‘DKIRA88’ are comparable to the variety Heuchera ‘Strawberry Candy’ U.S. Plant Pat. No. 19,125. The two Heuchera varieties are similar in most horticultural characteristics; however, the new variety ‘DKIRA88’ differs in the following: 1. Leaf main color of candidate variety is greyed-red compared to green of comparison variety.2. Flower color of candidate variety is light pink compared to. dark pink of comparison variety.3. Leaf underside color of candidate variety is purple compared to. green of comparison variety.4. Inflorescence of the new variety is occurs above, but, closer to the foliage than comparator variety. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying photograph in FIG. 1 illustrates in full color a typical plant of ‘DKIRA88’ grown in a greenhouse, in a 16 cm pot. Age of the plant photographed is approximately 4 months from a rooted cutting. FIG. 2 illustrates a close up of the foliage. The photographs were taken using conventional techniques and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance it is as accurate as possible by conventional photographic techniques.
