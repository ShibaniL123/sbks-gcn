CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/136,432 filed Dec. 20, 2013, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/401,015 filed Feb. 21, 2012 (now U.S. Pat. No. 8,639,288 issued Jan. 28, 2014), which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/463,661 filed Feb. 22, 2011, the contents of each of which is incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention Devices and methods for injecting medication are disclosed. More particularly, an electronics case with integrated components for auto-injector featuring spring activation and concealed needle 2 is disclosed. 2. Description of the Related Art Portable injectors are commonly used. Injectors such as epinephrine pens are carried by many people at risk for anaphylactic allergic reactions. If the user experiences the onset of anaphylaxis, they or a third party, can press the injector into an appropriate part of their body, such as an upper arm, thigh, abdomen, or buttocks. The injector then inserts a needle 2, usually due to the force of impact onto the body, and delivers the epinephrine to the user to treat the anaphylaxis. Often, it is useful for the user to seek follow-up treatment. It can be difficult for one to mentally force himself or herself to self-inject. Accordingly, injectors often have a stiff, resistive cover over the needle 2 so the injector needs to be pressed into the body with a high enough force to expose the needle 2, that the injection happens extremely fast and easier to perform because the force needed to expose the needle 2 will also insert it to its full depth in the tissue instantly. However, if the user is suffered anaphylaxis, it may be difficult to muster the requisite dexterity and strength to inject oneself with a typical manual, portable pen injector. Further, the dosage in the injector is fixed, but the needed medication for the patient may be more than available. Accordingly, if follow-up treatment is not received in a timely fashion, anaphylaxis can continue resulting in further health complications. Portable injectors are also easily forgotten since they are often used infrequently. Users may not have them available when in need. Accordingly, a portable injector with an auto-injection function is desired. Further, a portable injector that can summon follow-up treatment, such as emergency medical personnel is desired. A portable injector that can also be easily remembered and carried with the user is also desired. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An injector device is disclosed. The device can have a phone case and a needle 2. The phone case can have a reservoir. The needle 2 can be in fluid communication with the reservoir. The needle 2 can be spring-loaded in the case. The device can have a mobile phone 4. The phone case can be attached to the mobile phone 4, for example the phone 4 can be in the phone case. The device can have a heat shield between the mobile phone 4 and the reservoir. The reservoir can have a fluid. The fluid can include epinephrine and/or insulin. An injector device is further disclosed that can have a frame 6 and a mobile phone 4.

The bottom rim 58 can guide the phone 4 into the bottom frame. The cartridge 14 can be held or pressed between the phone 4 and the frame bottom 12. FIG. 12 illustrates that when the phone 4 is slid into the frame bottom 12, the phone connector 30 can plug into the phone 4 and/or the phone 4 can plug into the phone connector 30. The phone connector 30 can form a data and/or power connection and communication between the phone 4 and the operational electronics of the device frame 6. Instead or in combination with the phone connector 30, the operational electronics of the frame 6 can be in wireless data and/or power communication with the phone 4, such as by RF, Bluetooth, inductive power or data transfer, or combinations thereof. The rim 16 can hold the phone 4 and prevent phone 4 from translating forward with respect to the frame 6. FIG. 13 illustrates that the frame top 10 can be translated down toward the frame bottom 12, as shown by the arrow. A thermal insulating plate 60 or heat shield can slide between the cartridge 14 and the phone 4. The thermal insulating plate 60 can be made from ceramic, styrofoam, plastic, rubber, PTFE (e.g., Teflon), vinyl, laminates, epoxy/fiberglass, glass, paint, or combinations thereof. The thermal insulating plate 60 can be fixedly attached to the frame top 10, frame bottom 12 or front of the cartridge 14. The thermal insulating plate 60 can be separate from the other components and slid between the cartridge 14 and the phone 4 into the frame top 10 and bottom during assembly 17. For example, the thermal insulating plate 60 can be made from polyurethane and can have a coefficient of thermal conductivity k from about 0.020 W/mK to about 0.40 W/mK, for example about 0.033 W/mK. FIG. 14 illustrates that the frame top 10 can be attached to the frame bottom 12. For example, the connecting tabs 38 can deform and detachably fit into the tab holes. The frame top 10 and frame bottom 12 can cover the rear of the cartridge 14 and/or the rear of the phone 4. The frame top 10 can meet the frame bottom 12 at a frame seam 62. The tabs can be depressed and the top frame can be separated from the bottom frame. The cartridge 14 can then be replaced. For example an empty cartridge 14 can be replaced with a full cartridge 14 and then the top frame can then be reattached to the bottom frame. FIG. 15 illustrates that the trigger lever cover release button 34 can be depressed to release (e.g., unlatch, unlock, or combinations thereof) the trigger lever cover 20 from the remainder of the frame bottom 12. The trigger lever cover 20 can be translated or slid, as shown by arrow, off the frame 6, exposing the trigger lever 22. FIGS. 16 and 17 illustrate that the trigger lever can be slidably positioned in a lever window 64. The trigger lever and the lever window 64 can be exposed with the trigger lever cover 20 removed. The trigger lever can be in an unreleased position. For example, the trigger lever can be on the right side of the lever window 64 as shown. The trigger 8 can be recessed within the frame bottom 12. The trigger 8 can be aligned with and adjacent to the frame trigger port 54) when the trigger lever is in an unreleased position. The bottom terminal end of the trigger 8 can be in the frame trigger port 54 (as shown) when the trigger lever is in an unreleased position. The trigger 8 can have a needle port. The needle port 66 can be at the terminal end of a needle channel. The needle 2 can be slidably located within the needle channel. FIGS. 18 and 19 illustrate that the trigger lever can be translated, as shown by the arrow. For example, the trigger lever can be pushed or slid along the lever window 64 from the right to the left. The trigger lever translation can activate the trigger 8 to be translated, as shown by the arrow. For example, the trigger 8 can be spring-loaded and the lever translation 68 can release a latch or lock holding the trigger 8 in the device frame 6. The trigger 8 can exit (i.e., translate out of) and extend from the frame trigger port 54. The top end of the trigger 8 can be retained within and held be the device frame 6 and/or cartridge 14. The trigger 8 can be part of the cartridge 14. The trigger 8 can be slidably attached to the remained of the cartridge 14. FIG. 20 illustrates that the needle 2 can exit and extend from the needle port 66 in the trigger 8, as shown by the arrow. For example, the needle 2 can be spring-loaded and can be pushed out of the needle port 66 when the trigger 8 is activated. The trigger 8 can be activated by pressing up on the trigger 8 (i.e., toward the remainder of the cartridge 14 and device frame 6). For example, the device frame 6 and trigger 8 can be pressed into an arm, leg, abdomen or buttock, activating the trigger 8, and deploying the needle 2 into the tissue of the arm, leg, abdomen or buttock. The needle 2 can be retained by a safety catch when in the trigger 8 or cartridge 14. Activating the trigger 8, for example by pressing on the trigger 8, can release the safety catch. The proximal or top terminal end of the needle 2 can be held and retained by the trigger 8, and/or cartridge 14, and/or device frame 6. The needle 2 can be in fluid communication with the contained volume. When the trigger 8 is activated and/or when the needle 2 exits the needle port, pressurized fluid from within the contained volume can be forced through the extended needle 2. The needle 2 can inject, infuse or otherwise deliver the contents of the contained volume into the tissue. For example, the needle 2 can deliver the contained volume contents subcutaneously, percutaneously, intra-vascularly, or combinations thereof. When the trigger 8 is activated, a reservoir plunger spring and/or needle spring can be released and press on a reservoir plunger to push the reservoir and needle 2 down. The needle 2 can be fully deployed when the reservoir hard stops against the internal (i.e., inside of the frame 6) side of the trigger 8. The plunger spring and/or needle spring can then continue pressing on the plunger to force the fluid from the reservoir through the needle 2 and into the target site, for example into subcutaneous tissue. The device frame 6 can communicate to the phone 4 the actions of the trigger release, and/or needle 2 deployment, and/or delivery of the contents of the contained volume are delivered through the needle 2. The phone camera 72 (e.g., to take pictures of the surroundings or the patient) and/or the phone speaker 74 (e.g., to announce instructions or a medical emergency to the patient or passersby) can be automatically activated based on the actions communicated to the phone 4 by the device frame 6 through the phone connector 30 and/or wirelessly. FIG. 22 illustrates that the trigger lever cover 20 can be removed from the device frame 6, as shown by the arrow. The trigger lever cover 20 can be pulled off downwardly or rearwardly. The trigger lever can have a circular grip, as shown in FIG. 22, or a rectangular grip, as shown in FIGS. 7, 8, and 15-20. FIG. 23 illustrates that the trigger lever can be translated from the right to the left sides of the trigger lever window 64, as shown by the arrow. The trigger 8 can then be translatably deployed from the cartridge 14 and/or frame 6, as shown by arrow. FIG. 24 illustrates that when the trigger 8 is activated, the needle 2 can be deployed from the trigger 8, as shown by arrow. The needle 2 can then deliver to a target site of tissue the contents of the contained volume under pressure. FIG. 25 illustrates that the when the phone 4 receives communication from the device frame 6 that actions of the trigger release, and/or needle 2 deployment, and/or delivery of the contents of the contained volume are delivered through the needle 2 occur, the phone 4 can communicate data through a wired or wireless signal 76 to a call, text, SMS, or MMS recipient's phone 78, computer 80, computer network, or combinations thereof. The phone 4 can communicate, for example, by uploading the data to a network, calling emergency medical services with an automated message and sending the GPS location of the phone 4, calling or texting individuals on a contact list, or combinations thereof. The device frame 6 can send data to the phone 4 through the phone connector 30 of the actions such as trigger release/actuation, needle 2 deployment/translation, delivery of the reservoir contents/injection, and of fluid (e.g., medication) level or quantity in the contained volume in the cartridge 14, fluid (e.g., medication) level or quantity delivered in the injection, fluid (e.g., medication) or cartridge 14 age since manufacturing, fluid (e.g., medication) instantaneous, maximum, minimum, and average temperatures, fluid (e.g., medication) viability (e.g., a formula that can include the temperatures experiences by the fluid and the age of the fluid and the type of fluid), fluid (e.g., medication) type, brand, or combinations thereof. The device can have an optical or RFID sensor configured to detect a bar code or RFID tag on the cartridge 14 identifying the contents and can transmit the data to the phone 4. Phone 4 can transfer any medication or use data to a network, for example to a server and/or place a call, SMS, MMS, instant message or combinations thereof, such as to one or more contacts in a contact list (e.g., emergency medical services (“911 service”), primary healthcare provider, family, friends). The phone 4 can receive information, such as recall information regarding the medication or other information (e.g., update instructions for use, advertisements) targeted to users of the medication or device. Phone 4 can receive and transmit data to the electronics in the device frame 6, such as software updates. U.S. Pat. No. 7,390,319 is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
