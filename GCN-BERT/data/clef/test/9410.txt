METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR REDUCING PHOSPHORUS IN EFFLUENT OR FILTRATE FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a method for reduc¬ ing phosphorus in effluent or filtrate from a process which comprises a stage in which green liquor dregs are filtered using a green liquor dregs filter and at least one stage in which conditions are acidic. The invention further relates to a system for reducing phosphorus in effluent or filtrate from a process, in particular a chemical pulping process. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Effluents produced in pulp or paper mills and other effluent-producing plants are typically treated in waste water treatment plants to reduce the amount of compounds which may be harmful to the environment, such as phosphorus. Phosphorus must be removed from effluents that are discharged from the mill to the en¬ vironment, e.g. to a water system, to prevent pollu¬ tion. As environmental regulations restricting phos¬ phorus emissions tend to become stricter, there is a need to reduce the amount of phosphorus in effluents that are conveyed from the mill to a waste water treatment plant and ultimately to the environment. Traditional solutions for phosphorous removal involve e.g. tertiary treatment or use of phosphorus concentrating (P-concentrating) microorganisms. A drawback of tertiary treatment is the high investment and operating cost. P-concentrating microorganisms work in anaerobic media, which complicates the opera¬ tions required and involves specific treatments for the effluent to be used. The inventors have therefore recognized the need for a method for reducing phosphorus in effluent obtained from processes such as chemical pulping pro¬ cesses. PURPOSE OF THE INVENTION The purpose of the invention is to provide a new type of method for reducing phosphorus in effluent or filtrate from a process which comprises a stage in which green liquor dregs are filtered using a green liquor dregs filter and at least one stage in which conditions are acidic and a new type of system for re¬ ducing phosphorus in effluent or filtrate from a pro¬ cess, in particular a chemical pulping process.

In the drawings: Fig. 1 is a flow chart illustration of a method for reducing phosphorus in effluent or filtrate from a process which comprises a stage in which green liquor dregs are filtered using a green liquor dregs filter and at least one stage in which conditions are acidic . Fig. 2 is a schematic illustration of a sys¬ tem for reducing phosphorus in effluent or filtrate from a chemical pulping process which comprises a green dregs filtration stage and at least one stage in which conditions are acidic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for reducing phosphorus in effluent or filtrate from a process which comprises a stage in which green liquor dregs are filtered using a green liquor dregs filter and at least one stage in which conditions are acidic, wherein the method comprises the steps of: a) obtaining an effluent or filtrate from a stage in which conditions are acidic; b) adjusting pH of at least a portion of the effluent or filtrate to alkaline with an alkaline agent; c) allowing phosphorus to be precipitated in form of a phosphate salt; d) separating the precipitate to produce puri¬ fied effluent or filtrate and a sludge comprising the precipitate; and e) filtering the sludge comprising the precipitate obtainable from step d) using the green liq¬ uor dregs filter. In this context, the term "effluent" or "fil- trate" should be understood as referring to an aqueous liquid that contains phosphorus, which is to be re¬ moved either completely or in part. In this context, the term "effluent" should also be understood as referring to a waste liquid which is obtained from the process and which is to be discharged from the process. The effluent is usually treated for purifying purposes by waste water treat¬ ment before discharging. The waste water treatment may take place at a waste water treatment plant of a chem- ical pulping mill. The effluent may also refer e.g. a bleaching effluent or a filtrate which is to be dis- charged or to be treated for purifying purposes by waste water treatment before discharging. In this context, the term "filtrate" should also be understood as referring to an effluent from which solid suspended matter is removed by a filtra¬ tion treatment, a flotation treatment or any other treatment. Thus the term "filtrate" does not neces¬ sarily imply that the solid suspended matter, such as fibers, have been removed by filtration. The process may, in principle, be any process involving treatment of phosphorus-containing material of natural origin, provided it comprises at least one stage which produces acidic filtrate or effluent and a stage in which green liquor dregs are filtered using a green liquor dregs filter. The inventors of the present invention sur¬ prisingly found out that phosphorus present in the ef¬ fluent or filtrate may be precipitated, and the re¬ sulting phosphorus-containing precipitate may be con- veniently filtered using existing green dregs filtra¬ tion equipment; thus the removal of the precipitate requires minimal equipment investments. Thus the sludge comprising the phosphorus- containing precipitate may be conveyed to and filtered using the green liquor dregs filter. As the conditions at the green liquor dregs filter are alkaline, the phosphorus remains in the precipitate during the fil¬ tration . In an embodiment, the method comprises the steps of: al) obtaining a first portion of an effluent or filtrate from a stage in which conditions are acid¬ ic; a2) obtaining a second portion of an effluent or filtrate from the same or different stage in which conditions are acidic; b) adjusting pH of the first portion of the effluent or filtrate to alkaline with an alkaline agent ; c) allowing phosphorus to be precipitated in form of a phosphate salt; d) separating the precipitate to produce pu¬ rified effluent or filtrate and a sludge comprising the precipitate; e) filtering the sludge comprising the pre- cipitate obtainable from step d) using the green liq¬ uor dregs filter; and f) combining the purified effluent or fil¬ trate with the second portion of the effluent or fil¬ trate . In principle, any suitable method for sepa¬ rating the precipitate may be used in step d) . In an embodiment, the precipitate is separated in step d) by decantation, clarification, flotation, sedimentation or filtration. A purified effluent or filtrate is obtained. Further, a sludge comprising the precipitate and an amount of effluent or filtrate is obtained. As the volume of the sludge is smaller, typi¬ cally much smaller, than the volume of the purified ef¬ fluent or filtrate, the green liquor dregs filter does not become overloaded with the sludge. In an embodiment, the precipitate is separated in step d) using a decanter centrifuge, a clarifier, a solids separator, a flocculation apparatus or a filter. In an embodiment, the precipitate is separat- ed in step d) by liquid-solid filtration, pressure filtration, candle filtration, or disc filtration, or by any other suitable filtration method. In an embodiment, the sludge comprising the precipitate obtainable from step d) is filtered in step e) to obtain a filter cake comprising the fil- tered precipitate; and the method further comprises the step g) of recovering the filter cake. Prior to recovering, the filter cake may be washed . In an embodiment, the sludge comprising the precipitate obtainable from step d) and green liquor dregs are filtered in step e) for obtaining a filter cake comprising the precipitate and green liquor dregs; and the method further comprises the step g) of recovering the filter cake. In an embodiment, the sludge comprising the precipitate obtainable from step d) is filtered using a pre-coated green liquor dregs filter in step e) . In an embodiment, the sludge comprising the precipitate obtainable from step d) is filtered in step e) using a green liquor dregs filter pre-coated with a layer of lime mud. In an embodiment, the method further compris¬ es the step g) of recovering the filter cake compris- ing the filtered precipitate, green dregs and at least a portion of the layer of lime mud. The pre-coat layer of lime mud contains calcium carbonate. In such an em¬ bodiment, the recovered filter cake thus comprises calcium in the form of calcium carbonate. The recovered filter cake or precipitate can be reprocessed further for end uses or discarded. The method may be used in a chemical pulping mill, in which chemical pulp is produced using the so- called sulphate or kraft process. In this context, the term "pulp" should be understood as referring to a lignocellulosic fibrous material prepared by chemically or mechanically sepa¬ rating cellulose fibres from a natural fibre based ma¬ terial. So-called kraft or sulphate processes can be used for producing pulp. In an embodiment, the process is a chemical pulping process. In an embodiment, the process is a kraft pulping process. In an embodiment, the effluent or filtrate is issued from fiber line operations of a chemical pulp mill, such as a kraft pulp mill. The operations of a kraft pulp mill are con¬ ventionally divided in a fiber line, a chemical recov¬ ery system and waste water treatment. The fiber line operations typically include cooking, brownstock wash- ing (washing away spent cooking chemicals from the pulp) , oxygen delignification, bleaching and pulp drying. In many conventional kraft pulp mills, the pH in the cooking, brownstock washing, oxygen delignifica- tion and knotting and screening stages is alkaline. Any effluents or filtrates obtained from such stages are typically alkaline. Often the pH in one or more bleaching stages is acidic. Thus effluents or fil¬ trates obtained from bleaching stages may be acidic or alkaline, depending on the specific stage and the chemicals used therein. The chemical recovery system of a kraft pulp mill typically includes a green dregs filtration stage, in which dregs removed from the bottom of a green liquor clarifier, from a green liquor filter or from another apparatus suitable for separating green dregs are washed and filtered to recover alkali resi¬ due remaining in the green liquor dregs. In an embodiment, the effluent or filtrate is obtained from the first stage of the process in which the conditions are acidic. The present inventors have found that typi¬ cally very high phosphorus content is found in efflu¬ ents or filtrates obtainable from the first stage of the process in which the conditions are acidic. For instance, a concentration of phosphorus of the efflu¬ ent or filtrate may be 5 - 20 mg/1, or 9 - 16 mg/1. Thus it may be very useful to obtain the effluent or filtrate from the first stage of the process in which the conditions are acidic. In this embodiment, phos¬ phorus content in effluents or filtrates from the pro¬ cess may significantly be reduced, even if only the effluent or filtrate from the first stage of the pro¬ cess in which the conditions are acidic, or a portion thereof, is treated according to the method of the in¬ vention . The effluent or filtrate may be obtained from one or more stages of the process in which the condi¬ tions are acidic. The first portion of the effluent or filtrate and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate may be obtained from the same stage of the process in which the conditions are acidic. They may also be ob¬ tained from two or more different stages of the pro¬ cess in which the conditions are acidic. In an embodiment, the first portion of the effluent or filtrate is obtained from a first stage in which conditions are acidic; and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate is obtained from a second and/or later stage in which conditions are acidic. In an embodiment, the first portion of the effluent or filtrate is obtained from the first stage of the process in which conditions are acidic. In an embodiment, the at least a portion or the first and/or second portion of effluent or fil¬ trate comprises an effluent or filtrate obtained from a stage in which conditions are acidic, to which ef- fluent or filtrate an alkaline effluent or filtrate has been added. In this embodiment, the pH of said second portion of effluent or filtrate may not be al¬ kaline prior to step f ) . The pH of the first portion of effluent or filtrate may already be made alkaline by the addition or mixing of alkaline effluent or fil¬ trate therein prior to step b) , as the pH will in any case be adjusted to alkaline. The alkaline effluent or filtrate may be obtained from a stage of the process in which conditions are alkaline. The alkaline efflu¬ ent may be added or mixed to an effluent or filtrate obtained from a stage in which conditions are acidic prior to step a), al), a2), a3) and/or b) . The alka¬ line effluent or filtrate may also be added or mixed to the second portion prior to step f ) , provided the pH of said second portion of effluent or filtrate is not alkaline prior to step f ) . In an embodiment, the first portion of the effluent or filtrate is obtained from a first stage in which conditions are acidic; and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate is obtained from a second stage in which conditions are acidic. In an embodiment, the method comprises the steps of : a) obtaining an effluent or filtrate from a stage in which conditions are acidic; a3) dividing the effluent or filtrate into a first portion and a second portion; b) adjusting pH of the first portion of the effluent or filtrate to alkaline with an alkaline agent ; c) allowing phosphorus to be precipitated in form of a phosphate salt; d) separating the precipitate to produce pu¬ rified effluent or filtrate and a sludge comprising the precipitate; e) filtering the sludge comprising the pre- cipitate obtainable from step d) using the green liq¬ uor dregs filter; and f) combining the purified effluent or fil¬ trate with the second portion of the effluent or fil¬ trate . In an embodiment, the effluent or filtrate is obtained from the first stage of fiber line operations of a chemical pulp mill in which the conditions are acidic. The chemical pulp mill may be e.g. a kraft pulp mill. In an embodiment, the pH of the effluent or filtrate obtained in step a), al), a2) and/or a3) is below 7; or below 6; or below 3. In an embodiment, the pH of the effluent or filtrate obtained in step a), al), a2) and/or a3) is 1 - 7; or 2 - 7; or 1 - 6; or 2 - 6; or 1 - 3; or 2 - 3. In an embodiment, the effluent or filtrate is an acidic bleaching effluent or an acidic bleaching filtrate. Such acidic bleaching filtrates or acidic bleaching effluents are typically obtained from a chemical pulping process. In an embodiment, the acidic bleaching filtrate or acidic bleaching effluent is the acidic bleaching filtrate or acidic bleaching effluent obtainable from the first acidic bleaching stage. Typically very high phosphorus content is found in the acidic bleaching filtrate obtainable from the first acidic bleaching stage. Thus it may be very useful to obtain the acidic bleaching filtrate from the first acidic bleaching stage. In this embodiment, phosphorus content in effluents from the process may significantly be reduced, even if only the acidic bleaching filtrate from the first acidic bleaching stage, or a portion thereof, is treated according to the method of the invention. In this context, the term "bleaching stage" may refer to any stage after brown stock stages, and should be understood as also including oxygen deligni- fication stage (s), which selectively removes lignin, hexenuronic acid and/or metals. In this context, the term "bleaching stage" may also refer to any stages immediately following the oxygen stage. First bleach¬ ing stage can be an alkaline or an acidic one. Common- ly it is an acidic A stage followed by a D stage with¬ out a washing stage between them. This is the so called A/Dl bleaching stage. In an embodiment, the filtrate is an A, D, Dl, A/D or A/Dl bleaching filtrate or any other acidic bleaching filtrate. "A" should be understood as refer¬ ring to an acidic bleaching stage. "D" should be un- derstood as referring to a chlorine dioxide bleaching stage. A, D and Dl stages may be stages separate from each other; each of A, D and Dl stages should however in this context be understood as being bleaching stag¬ es . The acidic effluent may also be obtainable from the acidification treatment of unbleached pulp, which is performed before the bleaching, after brownstock washing and oxygen treatment of the oxygen delignification unit. This acidic effluent also typi- cally contains dissolved phosphorus compounds. The filtrate may also be an acidic filtrate obtainable from the acidification treatment of the un¬ bleached pulp after brownstock washing, which treatment is performed to dissolve acid-dissolving phospho- rus compounds contained in the pulp before bleaching. In an embodiment, the pH of the at least a portion of the effluent or filtrate is adjusted in step b) to 8 - 14; or 8 - 12; or to 9 - 10; or to 9.5 - 9.8. In an embodiment, the pH of the first portion of the effluent or filtrate is adjusted in step b) to 8 - 14; or 8 - 12; or to 9 - 10; or to 9.5 - 9.8. When pH of the at least a portion of the ef¬ fluent or filtrate is adjusted to alkaline, phosphorus precipitates, typically as calcium phosphate. The source of calcium in the calcium phosphate precipitat¬ ed may be calcium originally contained in the effluent or filtrate and/or calcium that is introduced to the at least a portion of the effluent or filtrate as a component of the alkaline agent. Thus the precipitate typically contains calcium phosphate. The precipitate may further comprise other phosphate salts, such as calcium hydrogen phosphate; calcium carbonate; calcium sulphate; organic phosphorus compounds; and/or other precipitated/coprecipitated components . The alkaline agent may be any agent that is capable of raising the pH of the at least a portion of the effluent or filtrate to a pH at which phosphorus can precipitate. The alkaline agent may be a solution, such as an aqueous solution, a solid, or a mixture thereof . In an embodiment, the alkaline agent is CaO; an alkali metal hydroxide, such as NaOH; Ca(OH)2; NH4OH; an alkaline effluent or filtrate; an alkaline bleaching effluent or filtrate; or a powder, an aqueous solution, or any mixture thereof . In an embodiment, the alkaline agent is solid CaO. In an embodiment, the alkaline agent is an aqueous solution of CaO, an aqueous solution of an al¬ kali metal hydroxide such as NaOH, an aqueous solution of Ca(OH)2, an aqueous solution of NH4OH, or any mixture thereof. The alkaline agent may also be a mixture of a solid and an aqueous solution. If the alkaline agent is Ca(OH)2, CaO, a pow- der, an aqueous solution or any mixture thereof, at least some of the calcium ions contained therein may precipitate with the phosphorus contained in the at least a portion of the effluent or filtrate. The alkaline agent may be an alkaline agent that is used for adjusting pH of waste water, such as an aqueous solution of Ca(OH)2. The concentration of the alkaline agent may vary. A relatively strong alkaline agent, or an aque¬ ous solution containing a high concentration of an alkaline agent, may however have the added utility that a small volume of the alkaline agent is needed to ad¬ just the pH to alkaline. Thus an increase in volume and dissolution of the precipitate can be avoided. For instance, if an aqueous solution of Ca(OH)2 is used as the alkaline agent, the concentration of the aqueous solution of Ca(OH)2 is preferably at least 2 g/1, or more preferably at least 20 g/1. Even more preferably the alkaline agent is solid CaO.. In step b) , the at least a portion of the ef¬ fluent or filtrate may be mixed with the alkaline agent. The mixing typically accelerates the precipita¬ tion of phosphorus. The mixing may be effected e.g. by agitation. The mixing may also be effected using an ap¬ paratus suitable for mixing the alkaline agent with the at least a portion of the acidic effluent or fil- trate. Such apparatus may be e.g. a tank or a piping comprising means for mixing. The means for mixing may be e.g. a mixer, a mixing arm or a stirrer. Such apparatus may also be e.g. a piping fitted with one or more nozzles for injecting the alkaline agent into the piping in which the acidic effluent or filtrate may flow . The temperature in in step b) may be set e.g. between 25 - 90 °C. Increasing the temperature may en¬ hance precipitation. After the precipitate is separated from the at least a portion of the effluent or filtrate, the puri¬ fied effluent or filtrate thus obtained has substan¬ tially reduced phosphorus content. The removal of phos¬ phorus is typically so efficient that the purified ef- fluent or filtrate obtained may be considered to be substantially free of phosphorus. It may not always be desirable to completely eliminate phosphorus from the effluent or filtrate, in particular in cases when the effluent or filtrate is subsequently conveyed to a waste water treatment plant. Many waste water treatment plants utilize bacterial processes for waste water treatment, for which a low amount of phosphorus in the effluent or filtrate is preferable or even necessary. Further, it may be sufficient to treat only the first portion of the effluent or filtrate in order to significantly reduce phosphorus content in the effluent or filtrate. For instance, a treatment of all acidic effluents or filtrates obtaina¬ ble from a process is not necessary to significantly reduce phosphorus in the total volume of effluents and filtrates obtainable from the whole process. In an embodiment, the at least a portion of the effluent or filtrate consists of 2 - 95 % (v/v); 5 - 95 % (v/v); 5 - 50 % (v/v); or 10 - 40 % (v/v) of the total volume of the effluent or filtrate. A significant reduction in phosphorus may be obtained even if a relatively small portion of the ef¬ fluent or filtrate as compared to the whole volume of the effluent or filtrate is treated using the method according to the invention. In an embodiment, the first portion of the effluent or filtrate consists of 2 - 95 % (v/v); 5 - 95 % (v/v); 5 - 50 % (v/v); or 10 - 40 % (v/v) of the total volume of the effluent or filtrate. In this con¬ text, the total volume of the effluent or filtrate should be understood as consisting of the total volume of both the first and second portion. A significant reduction in phosphorus in ef¬ fluent or filtrate may be obtained even if the first portion of the effluent or filtrate is a relatively small portion as compared to the whole volume of the effluent or filtrate. The first and second portion of the effluent or filtrate or their volume ratios may be selected so that e.g. the concentration of phosphorus, the pH of said portions and/or the pH of the combined purified effluent or filtrate and the second portion of the ef¬ fluent or filtrate is optimal. In an embodiment, the first portion of the effluent or filtrate has a higher content or concen¬ tration of phosphorus than the second portion. In an embodiment, the first portion of the effluent or filtrate has a phosphorus concentration of 5 - 20 mg/1; or 9 - 16 mg/1. In an embodiment, the first portion of the effluent or filtrate is obtainable from the stage in which conditions are acidic and in which the content or concentration of phosphorus is highest. Step f) may be performed at any stage of the process before post-neutralization of the combination obtainable from step f) in a waste water treatment plant, wherein the post-neutralization is performed for adjusting the pH suitable for aerobic treatment. The post-neutralization is typically performed before the aeration basin. It may, for instance, be performed at the fiberline, before preliminary clarifier treat- ment or at any other stage before aeration. It should also be understood that step e) (and optionally step g) ) and step f ) (and optionally h) ) may be performed simultaneously or in any order. In an embodiment, the method further compris- es the step h) of conveying the combination of the pu¬ rified effluent or filtrate and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate obtainable from step f) to waste water treatment or discharge. The combination of the purified effluent or filtrate and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate obtainable from step f) may be directly con¬ veyed to waste water treatment, e.g. to a waste water treatment plant, or discharge. The pH of the combina¬ tion of the purified effluent or filtrate and the sec¬ ond portion of the effluent or filtrate obtainable from step f) may also be further adjusted, e.g. to a neutral pH, if necessary. In an embodiment, the pH of the combination of the purified effluent or filtrate and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate obtainable from step f) is neutral or near neutral. In an embodiment, the pH of the combination of the purified effluent or filtrate and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate obtainable from step f) is in the range of 6 to 8, or in the range of 6.5 to 7.5. In an embodiment, the pH of the combination of the purified effluent or filtrate and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate obtainable from step f) is adjusted to neutral or near neutral. In an embodiment, the pH of the combination of the purified effluent or filtrate and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate obtainable from step f) is adjusted to a pH in the range of 6 to 8, or in the range of 6.5 to 7.5. If the purified effluent or filtrate is com- bined with the second portion of the effluent or fil¬ trate, the second portion of the effluent or filtrate is often capable of adjusting the pH to a lower level. The pH of the resulting combination may thus be neutral or close to a neutral pH . Depending e.g. on the ratio of the volume of the purified effluent or fil¬ trate to the volume of the second portion of the ef¬ fluent or filtrate, pH of the combination of the puri¬ fied effluent or filtrate and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate obtainable from step f) may be further adjusted. A suitable neutralising agent may be used to adjust the pH of the effluent. The neutral- ising agent may be an alkaline agent or an acidic agent . In an embodiment, the alkaline agent with which the pH of the combination of the purified efflu- ent or filtrate and the second portion of the effluent or filtrate obtainable from step f) is adjusted is the same alkaline agent with which pH of the first portion of the effluent or filtrate is adjusted to alkaline in step b) .

The green liquor dregs filtration apparatus may comprise a green liquor dregs filter. It may also comprise e.g. an apparatus for washing the green liq¬ uor dregs filter and/or the filter cake obtainable us¬ ing the filter. In an embodiment, the green liquor dregs fil- ter is pre-coated. In an embodiment, the green liquor dregs fil¬ ter is pre-coated with lime mud. The first conduit for conveying the at least a portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate from the apparatus for separating effluent or filtrate from pulp to the purification apparatus may be connected to said apparatuses either directly or indirectly, or via suitable means. The first conduit provides a flow con¬ nection between said apparatuses. In particular, the first conduit provides a flow connection between the apparatus for separating effluent or filtrate from pulp and the apparatus adapted for mixing an alkaline agent with at least a portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate and for allowing phosphorus to be precipi- tated in form of a phosphate salt. The separation apparatus for separating the precipitate to produce purified effluent or filtrate and the sludge comprising the precipitate may be e.g. a decanter centrifuge, a clarifier, a solids separator, a flocculation apparatus or a filter such as a pressure filter, a candle filter, or a disc filter. The second conduit for conveying the sludge comprising the precipitate from the purification apparatus to the green liquor dregs filtration apparatus may be connected to said apparatuses either directly or indirectly, or via suitable means. The second con- duit provides a flow connection between said apparat¬ uses . The system may also contain pumps for various fluids, appropriate piping, tanks, and/or mixers. It may further contain e.g. drying apparatus for drying bleached pulp, a chemical recovery system and/or other components of a chemical pulp mill. The chemical recov¬ ery system may include an alkali cycle and a lime cir¬ culation system. In an embodiment, the bleaching apparatus comprises an apparatus for separating effluent or fil¬ trate from pulp obtainable from a bleaching stage for separating acidic effluent or filtrate obtainable from the first bleaching stage in which conditions are acidic. In an embodiment, the apparatus for separat¬ ing effluent or filtrate from pulp obtainable from a bleaching stage is a filtering apparatus for filtering acidic effluent or filtrate obtainable from a bleach- ing stage. In other embodiments, the apparatus for sepa¬ rating effluent or filtrate from pulp obtainable from a bleaching stage may be a press, a wash press, a drum displacer washer or any other apparatus which is capa- ble of separating pulp and effluent or filtrate. Each of the first, second and third conduits may comprise e.g. a pipe or any other means for estab¬ lishing a flow connection. In an embodiment, the apparatus adapted for mixing an alkaline agent with the at least a portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate comprises a conduit for introducing the alkaline agent. It may further comprise an apparatus for mixing the alkaline agent with the at least a portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate. Such apparatus may be e.g. piping fitted with one or more nozzles for injecting the alkaline agent into the piping in which the at least a portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate may flow. The alkaline agent may be any alkaline agent described above. In an embodiment, the alkaline agent is CaO; an alkali metal hydroxide, such as NaOH; Ca(OH)2; NH4OH; an alkaline effluent or filtrate; an alkaline bleaching effluent or filtrate; or a powder, an aqueous solution, or any mixture thereof . In an embodiment, the system comprises a reac¬ tor for bringing the alkaline agent in contact with the at least a portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate to effect the precipitation of phosphorus. The reactor may be fitted with one or more nozzles for injecting the alkaline agent into the reactor. The alkaline agent may thus be introduced continuously by injecting it in a flow of the at least a portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate. In a reactor, the at least a por¬ tion of the acidic effluent or filtrate may flow in a pipe and the alkaline agent may be injected into the flow . In an embodiment, the system comprises: a digestion apparatus for cooking pulp; a washing apparatus for washing pulp; a bleaching apparatus comprising an apparatus for separating effluent or filtrate from pulp obtaina¬ ble from a bleaching stage in which conditions are acidic; a green liquor dregs filtration apparatus; a purification apparatus for removing phosphorus from the acidic effluent or filtrate, compris¬ ing an apparatus adapted for mixing an alkaline agent with at least a portion of the acidic effluent or fil¬ trate and for allowing phosphorus to be precipitated in form of a phosphate salt, and a separation appa¬ ratus for separating the precipitate to produce puri- fied effluent or filtrate and a sludge comprising the precipitate ; a first conduit for conveying a first portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate from the apparatus for separating effluent or filtrate from pulp to the purification apparatus; a second conduit for conveying the sludge comprising the precipitate from the purification apparatus to the green liquor dregs filtration apparatus; a third conduit for conveying a second por- tion of the acidic effluent or filtrate; and an apparatus for combining the purified ef¬ fluent or filtrate with the second portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate.

The embodiments of the invention described hereinbefore may be used in any combination with each other. Several of the embodiments may be combined to¬ gether to form a further embodiment of the invention. A method or a system, to which the invention is related, may comprise at least one of the embodiments of the invention described hereinbefore. An advantage of the present invention is that the content of phosphorus in effluent or filtrate com¬ ing from the process may be significantly reduced by the method according to the present invention. An advantage of the method according to the present invention is that it is a low cost process, which does not require significant investments for equipment. The phosphorus-containing precipitate can be easily removed in the green dregs filtration stage. It also does not require significant invest¬ ments for reagents; reagents such as alkaline agents which would in any case be used to adjust the pH of effluent or filtrate may be utilized. An advantage of the method according to the present invention is that the need to adjust the pH of effluent or filtrate is reduced. An advantage of the method according to the present invention is that a significant reduction in phosphorus in effluent or filtrate may be obtained even if the volume of the at least a portion of the effluent or filtrate is relatively small as compared to the whole volume of the effluent or filtrate. An advantage of the method according to the present invention is that small amounts of phosphorus may be retained in the effluent or filtrate that is conveyed to waste water treatment; this may be advan¬ tageous e.g. when the subsequent waste water treatment utilizes bacterial processes, for which an amount of phosphorus in the effluent or filtrate is preferable. An advantage of the method according to the present invention is that it can be performed e.g. at the fiber line of a chemical pulping mill. Thus it can be used to reduce phosphorus in effluent or filtrate already at the chemical pulping mill. An advantage of the method according to the present invention is that the phosphorus containing precipitate may be recovered and reprocessed for fur¬ ther use.

The description below discloses some embodi¬ ments of the invention in such a detail that a person skilled in the art is able to utilize the invention based on the disclosure. Not all steps of the embodi¬ ments are discussed in detail, as many of the steps will be obvious for the person skilled in the art based on this specification. For reasons of simplicity, item numbers will be maintained in the following exemplary embodiments in the case of repeating components. Figure 1 illustrates a method according to one embodiment of the present invention for reducing phosphorus in effluent or filtrate from a process which comprises at least one stage in which conditions are acidic. The process comprises in this embodiment at least two separate process stages in which condi¬ tions are acidic. In step a), a first portion of an effluent or filtrate is obtained from one such stage. A second portion of an effluent or filtrate is ob¬ tained either from a separate stage in step a2), or the effluent or filtrate which is obtained from a sin- gle stage is divided in step a3) into a first portion and a second portion. The first portion thus obtained is conveyed to step b) . In the purification stage, an alkaline agent, such as Ca(OH)2, is added to adjust the pH of a first portion of the effluent or filtrate to alkaline in step b) . In step c) , phosphorus is allowed to be precipitated, and the precipitate is separated to produce purified effluent or filtrate and a sludge comprising the precipitate in step d) . The purified effluent or filtrate from which the precipitate has been separated may be combined in step f) with a sec¬ ond portion of effluent or filtrate obtained in step a2) or a3) . The sludge comprising the precipitate is filtered in the green dregs filtration stage in step e) . Thus a filter cake comprising the precipitate and green filter dregs can be obtained. Figure 2 illustrates a system according to one embodiment of the present invention for reducing phosphorus in effluent or filtrate from a chemical pulping process which comprises at least one stage in which conditions are acidic. Various components that may be a part of the system have not been included in this schematic illustration for simplicity. In partic¬ ular, other components of the chemical recovery system except the green dregs filtration apparatus 5 and any flow connections between the digestion apparatus 1 and the green dregs filtration apparatus 5 have not been included for simplicity. In this exemplary embodiment, the system com- prises a digestion apparatus 1 for cooking pulp from lignocellulosic material. From the digestion apparatus 1, the pulp (often called "brownstock") is conveyed to a washing apparatus 2 for washing the pulp. The washing apparatus 2 may contain e.g. one or more brownstock washers, typically using countercurrent flow. The washed pulp is conveyed to a bleaching appa¬ ratus 3. In this embodiment, the bleaching apparatus contains three bleaching stages denoted 3', 3'' and 3'''. Stage 3', in this embodiment the first bleaching stage, is a bleaching stage in which conditions are acidic, for instance an A/Dl stage; stages 3'' and 3''' may be acidic or alkaline. The system also com¬ prises apparatus 11 for drying pulp. The bleaching ap¬ paratus 3 comprises an apparatus 4 for separating acidic effluent or filtrate from pulp obtainable from bleaching stage 3'. The system further comprises a purification apparatus 6 comprising an apparatus 7 adapted for mixing an alkaline agent with at least a portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate and for al¬ lowing phosphorus to be precipitated in form of a phosphate salt and a separation apparatus 8 for sepa- rating the precipitate to produce purified effluent or filtrate and a sludge comprising the precipitate. The separation apparatus may be e.g. a disc filter. A first conduit 9 is provided for conveying at least a portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate from the apparatus 4 for separating effluent or filtrate from pulp to the purification apparatus 6, specifically to the apparatus 7 adapted for mixing an alkaline agent with the at least a portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate and for allowing phosphorus to be precipitat- ed in form of a phosphate salt. A second conduit 10 is provided for conveying the sludge comprising the pre¬ cipitate from the purification apparatus 6 and specif¬ ically from the separation apparatus 8 to the green liquor dregs filtration apparatus 5. This embodiment further comprises a third conduit 13 for conveying a second portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate ob¬ tainable from the apparatus 4 for separating effluent or filtrate from pulp; and a fourth conduit 14 for conveying the purified effluent or filtrate from the separation apparatus 8. The third conduit 13 is con¬ nected to the apparatus 4 for separating effluent or filtrate from pulp. The fourth conduit 14 is connected to the separation apparatus 8 for separating the precipitate to produce purified effluent or filtrate. The third conduit 13 and the fourth conduit 14 are con¬ nected directly or indirectly for combining the puri- fied effluent or filtrate with the second portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate. The third conduit 13 and the fourth conduit 14 may be connected e.g. so that they form a conduit for conveying the combination of the purified effluent or filtrate and the second portion of the acidic effluent or filtrate to a waste water treatment plant 12 and further to discharge. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that with the advancement of technology, the basic idea of the invention may be implemented in various ways. The invention and its embodiments are thus not limited to the examples described above; instead they may vary within the scope of the claims. 1.
