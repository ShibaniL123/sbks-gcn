P/00/011 Regulation 3.2 Australia Patents Act 1990 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION STANDARD PATENT Invention Title: Sheep segregator The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method of performing it known to us: Sheep segregator Field of the invention The present invention relates to sheep handling and in particular to a segregator for use in a sheep handling system. ; Background of the invention Sheep handling systems are used in the farming industry to transport sheep through a race for the purposes of shearing, crutching, drenching, or other treatments. One form of sheep handling system includes individual transport cells to house individual sheep and move them along the race from one cell to the next. Various ) techniques have been developed for moving sheep along a race. However, delivery of individual sheep to the first upstream end or first holding cell and to subsequent downstream holding cells of the sheep handling system has proven to be problematic. It is known sheep behaviour that sheep prefer to “follow the leader” and tend to follow in close proximity, with head to tail of the downstream / leading > sheep. Sheep also have excellent ability to quickly assess if they can safely fit through a gap or space. The present invention aims to at least alleviate some of the problems associated with segregating sheep at the entry to a sheep handling system by exploiting their natural behaviour attributes. 20 Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be understood, regarded as relevant, and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled person in the art. 25 Summary of the invention The present invention is largely based on the observations of sheep behaviour and relies in part on the tendency for sheep to want to follow the sheep in front of them in a race. The invention accordingly provides a segregator system including: a gate movable between an open position and a closed position, the gate including a vertical support member and a plurality of obstructing means operably connected to the support member; actuation means to move the support member and thereby the gate between the open and closed positions; wherein each of the plurality of obstructing means is arranged horizontally with respect to the support member and spaced vertically from one another. The segregator system is preferably used at the entry of a sheep handling system but it may of course be used in other circumstances including but not limited to use in a multiple series of such segregators in a race. Advantageously when the gate is in an open position sheep are permitted to move past the gate and enter the next section of a sheep handling system. When the gate is closed, sheep are not able to move further through the race nor reverse back past the segregator. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the plurality of obstructing means take the form of horizontal plates having a first end operably connected to the support member and a distal end. Advantageously the horizontal plates are shaped and configured to assist in segregation of the sheep. Accordingly, each horizontal plate takes the form of a generally “P” shape such that each plate, when the gate is in the closed position, has a forwardly facing straight edge and a rearwardly facing curved edge. The horizontal plates are preferably spaced vertically from one another by a distance sufficient to allow following sheep to maintain visual contact with the sheep in front of them. Advantageously the separation distance is in the range 100 - 170mm, preferably 150mm. The support member preferably takes the form of a vertical elongate rotating post supported in a housing and rotatable by the actuation means in order to move the gate > from the open position to the closed position and vice versa. The housing and post are preferably mounted on a base plate. The actuation means preferably takes the form of a pneumatic ram. The pneumatic ram may be housed in the base plate. Advantageously, operation of the pneumatic ram is provided by a sensor. For example, a “sheep present” sensor may be ) installed in the first cell of the sheep handling system and used to indicate when the next sheep is needed in the first cell. In some embodiments, operation of the pneumatic ram may be time- based or manually operated. Further aspects of the present invention and further embodiments of the aspects described in the preceding paragraphs will become apparent from the following 5 description, given by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings. Brief description of the drawings The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of the segregator in accordance with 20 an embodiment of the invention, shown in the closed position, within a race; Figure 2 is a diagrammatic plan view of the segregator of Figure 1 also illustrating a portion of a race; Figure 3 is a diagrammatic front view of the segregator of Figure 1 as seen by an approaching sheep; 25 Figure 4 is a diagrammatic perspective view of the segregator of Figure 1 shown in the open position; Figure 5 is a diagrammatic plan view of the segregator of Figure 4 also illustrating a portion of a race; Figure 6 is a diagrammatic front view of the segregator of Figure 4; Detailed description of the embodiments Referring to the Figures there is illustrated a segregator 10 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. As shown, segregator 10 includes a gate 12 movable between a closed position (Figure 1) and an open position (Figure 4). Rearwardly and forwardly as used in this description relates to the direction of movement of sheep through the race 30 and gate ) 12 and into an associated sheep handling system. The direction is indicated by arrow A in the Figures. Race 30 also includes associated side fencing (not illustrated) which defines an enclosed race for the sheep to advance along. When the gate 12 is in an open position sheep are permitted to enter a section Β of a race 30 of a sheep handling system (not shown). When the gate 12 is closed, sheep are not able to move through the race 30 into section Β. Section Β is typically a holding cell for sheep waiting to be processed. Multiple holding cells each having an associated segregator allows movement of a line of individual sheep through the race 30. Gate 12 includes a vertical support member or post 14 supported in housing 15. Post 14 is rotatable about axis 16 in order to move the gate 12 between the open and closed positions and vice versa. Post 14 is preferably actuated using a pneumatic ram 19 although it will be appreciated that other conventional actuation mechanisms may be employed. Both post 14 and housing 15 are mounted on a base plate 17 and stand outside the race 30. In an alternate embodiment base plate 17 extends perpendicularly across the race 30 and may form part of the floor of the race 30. Post 14 supports a plurality of obstructing means in the form of horizontal arms or plates 18. Each of the plates has a first end 20 operably connected to the post 14 and a distal end 22. In a particularly preferred embodiment the horizontal plates 18 are shaped and configured to make practicable the segregation of the sheep. Accordingly, each horizontal plate 18 takes the form of a generally “P” shape (as shown in Figure 2) such that each plate 18, when the gate 12 is in the closed position, has a forwardly facing straight edge 24, a curved leading edge 25, and a rearwardly facing curved edge 26. The horizontal plates 18 are preferably spaced vertically from one another by a distance sufficient to allow following sheep to maintain visual contact with the sheep in front of them but not push their heads between the adjacent plates In the embodiment illustrated, four horizontal plates 18 are illustrated. The central “plate” is replaced with a curved arm 28 to accommodate a push and pull mechanism 3 associated with the sheep handling system. The spacing of plates 18 and curved arm 28 thereby allows for unimpeded deployment of a pusher arm whilst simultaneously preventing the sheep from (wanting) to back out of an associated section of the sheep handling system or the next sheep from proceeding forward. In use, the segregator 10 is biased to the closed position until post 14 is actuated to open the gate 12. Actuation may be manually controlled or may be controlled via a sensor. For example, a “sheep present” sensor may be installed in the first cell of an associated sheep handling system and used to indicate when the next sheep is needed in the first cell. In some embodiments, operation of the pneumatic ram may be timebased. As the sheep approach the segregator 10 they first encounter the curved rearward edge 26 of plates 18. Due to the vertical spacing of the plates 18 the sheep are still able to maintain visual contact with sheep ahead of them beyond the segregator so that their tendency to want to follow is allowed to occur. When the next sheep is needed in the sheep handling system, gate 12 is opened to the position shown in Figure 5. The spacing of plates 18 also enables the plates 18 to move through gaps in the side rails of race fencing as the gate 12 is opened thereby providing a clear unobstructed path for the sheep to enter the next section of the race. When the sheep has passed through the segregator 10 the gate 12 is closed. In operation, the advancing curved leading edge 25 of the “P” can be timed to gently brush past the hindquarters of an entering sheep and is visible to any closely following sheep and induces it to momentarily baulk at the object and the restriction of space that it causes. That moment of baulking allows the segregator to continue through to its closed position, thereby effectively segregating the continuous flow of sheep into individual animals for further handling. > The rounded “P” shape has further advantage in that it eliminates any snagging or catching of any part of a sheep as it transits past. The horizontal plates may be provided in a different shapes and configurations than those illustrated in the Figures. The person skilled in the art will also appreciate that variations to the shape of the plates are considered within the scope of the invention. ) It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the use of plates to form the “P” shape limits the opportunity for sheep to get parts of their body (especially legs) into the mechanism, such as if trying to jump over the unit. When the front of the sheep being segregated from the flow has adequately passed through the segregator, the segregator begins to close. By control of the speed of the closing motion there is still space for that sheep being segregated from the flow to continue past the rounded edges 25 of the segregator. Importantly, the movement of the segregator provides the inducement to the following sheep to baulk to assess if there is sufficient space for it (in its judgement) to safely pass. It is that moment of normal sheep behaviour that this invention seeks to exploit and provides the opportunity to complete the safe closing of the unit to effect the segregation of a continuous flow of sheep to a series of individuals for further individual handling activities as desired. It will be appreciated that the sheep segregator of the invention provides an effective means of isolating each sheep from the continuous stream by momentarily baulking a following sheep, maintaining visual contact between the sheep, and acting as a rear gate to prevent sheep from backing out of an associated section of a sheep handling system.
