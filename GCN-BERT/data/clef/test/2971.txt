CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a Continuation application of PCT Application No. PCT/JP2013/082220, filed Nov. 29, 2013 and based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-263567, filed Nov. 30, 2012, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference. FIELD Embodiments described herein relate generally to a medical image processing apparatus. BACKGROUND As is known, an ischemic heart disease is a disorder in the heart which is caused when the flow of blood to the cardiac muscle becomes insufficient or is stopped by being blocked by occlusion, constriction, or the like of a coronary artery. The symptoms of this disease include pain and a feeling of tightness mainly in the precordium and sometimes in the left arm or back. An FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve) is an index for determining whether the cardiac muscle is in an ischemic state due to a coronary stenosis. As shown in FIG. 9, a pressure wire is inserted into a blood vessel of an object to measure an upstream pressure Pin and a downstream pressure Pout of a constricted portion. The above index is defined as FFR=Pout/Pin. In general, if the FFR value is less than 0.8 (serious condition), the patient requires a surgical treatment (PCI: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention), whereas if the FFR value is more than 0.8, the doctor often chooses a medicinal treatment. Since FFR measurement using a pressure wire is invasive, demands have arisen for non-invasive measurement/calculation methods. Under the circumstances, a simulation-based measurement method using fluid analysis has recently been proposed. This simulation is a three-dimensional simulation. The basic concept of simulation-based measurement is that an FFR is obtained by calculating a pressure using the Navier-Stokes equations, which are generally used in CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), using as inputs physical parameters such as the hardness of a blood vessel wall and the blood inflow rate calculated from contrast images. Simulation-based measurement, however, requires time-series volume data throughout at least one heartbeat, and hence it takes much labor and time to perform imaging and data analysis. In addition, in a cardiac phase in which the heart moves fast, an image of a coronary artery sometimes blurs. There is therefore a possibility that data may contain an error.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION A medical image processing apparatus according to this embodiment processes images in a plurality of cardiac phases concerning the heart. The apparatus extracts a plurality of coronary artery centerline structures from a plurality of images. The apparatus generates a plurality of coronary artery centerline structures throughout one heartbeat of the heart by interpolating coronary artery centerline structures concerning other cardiac phases from the plurality of extracted coronary artery centerline structures. The apparatus calculates a displacement distribution between the respective cardiac phases from the plurality of coronary artery centerline structures throughout one heartbeat. The apparatus generates a coronary artery model from an image concerning a specific phase. The apparatus deforms the coronary artery model for each cardiac phase based on the displacement distribution. FIG. 1 shows the arrangement of the medical image processing apparatus according to this embodiment. A medical image processing apparatus 1 according to the embodiment is connected to a CT apparatus 2 including an electrocardiograph 3 via a network 4 such as a LAN or public electronic communication line. The CT apparatus 2 includes a two-dimensional array detector and implements volume scanning. The CT apparatus 2 generates three-dimensional CT image data (to be simply referred to as volume data hereinafter) by volume scanning. The medical image processing apparatus 1 includes an interface 11. The medical image processing apparatus 1 includes an image storage unit 13 which stores volume data supplied from the CT apparatus 2 under the control of a control unit 12 and respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases concerning a chest region including the heart of the object as a processing target image. Each volume data is associated with a cardiac phase at the time of data acquisition, which is measured by the electrocardiograph 3. Note that a cardiac phase expresses each position in one heartbeat period by percentage. A coronary artery analysis processing unit 14 extracts regions of the inner and outer walls of a coronary artery by using the coronary artery region extracted from volume data based on contrast medium CT values. A three-dimensional model generation unit 16 generates a three-dimensional coronary artery model indicating a stereoscopic structure constituted by inner wall lines and outer wall lines from the regions of the inner and outer walls extracted by the coronary artery analysis processing unit 14 and corresponding to a specific cardiac phase. Note that a specific cardiac phase is typically an end diastole (ED) in which pulsation is relatively small. A centerline analysis processing unit 15 extracts a coronary artery centerline structure (wire model) indicating the centerlines of a coronary artery region extracted, based on contract medium CT values, from volume data respectively corresponding to two specific cardiac phases selected from the volume data respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases stored in the image storage unit 13 under the readout control of the control unit 12. Note that the two specific cardiac phases are typically an end systole (ES) and an end diastole (ED) in which pulsation is relatively small. The centerline analysis processing unit 15 generates coronary artery centerline structures in other cardiac phases from a coronary artery centerline structure in the end systole (ES) and a coronary artery centerline structure in the end diastole (ED) by interpolation processing. This generates a plurality of coronary artery centerline structures respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases throughout one heartbeat period. In addition, the centerline analysis processing unit 15 calculates a displacement at each point on a centerline between the respective cardiac phases, i.e., a moving direction and a moving distance, from a plurality of coronary artery centerline structures respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases throughout one heartbeat period, and generates a corresponding displacement distribution. A four-dimensional model generation unit 18 deforms the three-dimensional coronary artery model in accordance with the displacement distribution. The four-dimensional model generation unit 18 generates a plurality of three-dimensional coronary artery models respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases throughout one heartbeat period by linking deformation processes in all the cardiac phases. Such a plurality of three-dimensional coronary artery models constituting time-series data will be collectively referred to as a four-dimensional coronary artery deformation model. A fluid analysis processing unit 19 calculates displacement amounts (e.g., a diameter change, bending angle change, and moving distance) of the coronary artery between the respective cardiac phases at each position on the coronary artery from the four-dimensional coronary artery deformation model, and calculates the hardness of the blood vessel wall and a blood inflow rate from the deformation amount for each position and each cardiac phase. The fluid analysis processing unit 19 also calculates a pressure for each position on the coronary artery and each cardiac phase by applying fluid analysis processing to the hardness of the blood vessel wall and the distribution of blood inflow rates. This can generate a pressure distribution approximated to the actual measurement by a pressure wire. A color map generation unit 20 converts the pressure distributions in the respective cardiac phases into color maps with different hues corresponding to the pressures by using a predetermined lookup table. A display unit 21 superimposes and displays each color map on the three-dimensional coronary artery model in a corresponding cardiac phase. FIG. 2 shows a procedure for medical image processing according to this embodiment. The coronary artery analysis processing unit 14 extracts a coronary artery region (contrast medium region) based on the CT value of the contrast medium from each time-series volume data stored in the image storage unit 13, and extracts the inner and outer walls of the coronary artery from the coronary artery region (S1). The apparatus then selects the data of the inner and outer walls in a specific cardiac phase from, typically a cardiac phase in end diastole in which pulsation is small, from the inner and outer walls in the respective cardiac phases under the readout control of the control unit 12 (S3). The three-dimensional model generation unit 16 generates three-dimensional coronary artery model (see the upper left of FIG. 4) indicating the stereoscopic structure of coronary artery blood vessels corresponding to the end diastole phase from the data of the inner and outer walls in the end diastole phase (S5). The centerline analysis processing unit 15 extracts coronary artery centerline structures (see upper right of FIG. 4) indicating centerlines in the coronary artery region extracted, based on the CT value of the contrast medium, for volume data selected from volume data respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases stored in the image storage unit 13 under the readout control of the control unit 12, typically volume data respectively corresponding to two cardiac phases, i.e., an end systole (ES) and an end diastole (ED) in which pulsation is relatively small (S2), as shown in FIG. 3. The centerline analysis processing unit 15 generates a plurality of coronary artery centerline structures respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases between the end systole (ES) and the end diastole (ED) from the coronary artery centerline structure in the end systole (ES) and the coronary artery centerline structure in the end diastole (ED) by interpolation processing (S4). This generates a plurality of coronary artery centerline structures respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases throughout one heartbeat period. The apparatus then calculates a displacement (a moving direction and moving distance) at each point on a centerline between the respective cardiac phases from the plurality of coronary artery centerline structures respectively corresponding to the plurality of cardiac phases throughout one heartbeat period (S6). The four-dimensional model generation unit 18 generates a four-dimensional model by deforming the three-dimensional coronary artery model in the end diastole (ED) as a reference in a chained manner (see the middle of FIG. 4) in accordance with the displacement distributions in the respective cardiac phases (S7). The fluid analysis processing unit 19 calculates displacement amounts (e.g., a diameter change, bending angle change, and moving distance) of the coronary artery between the respective cardiac phases, for each position on the coronary artery, from this four-dimensional coronary artery deformation model, and calculates the hardness of the blood vessel wall and the blood inflow rate from the displacement amounts for each position and each cardiac phase (S8). The fluid analysis processing unit 19 calculates a pressure distribution for each cardiac phase on the coronary artery by applying fluid analysis processing to the hardness of the blood vessel wall and the distribution of blood inflow rates (S9). The color map generation unit 20 converts the pressure distributions in the respective cardiac phases into color maps with different hues corresponding to the pressures by using a predetermined lookup table (S10). A display unit 21 superimposes and displays each color map on the three-dimensional coronary artery model in a corresponding cardiac phase (S11). As described above, the apparatus generates a plurality of three-dimensional coronary artery models, i.e., a four-dimensional coronary artery deformation model, concerning a plurality of cardiac phases throughout one heartbeat by interpolating centerline structures in cardiac phases, other than a specific cardiac phase which is important for the analysis of the movement of the coronary artery and in which the heart does not move much, with reference to the centerline structure in the specific cardiac phase, and deforming the three-dimensional coronary artery model in the specific cardiac phase, in which the heart does not move much, from the centerline structures. This can shorten the time required for imaging and data analysis. In addition, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of analysis errors by thinning out cardiac phases in which the heart moves fast. FIG. 5 shows a modification of the procedure in FIG. 2. The same step numbers as in FIG. 2 denote the same steps in FIG. 5, and a description of them will be omitted. In step S12, the centerline analysis processing unit 15 extracts coronary artery centerline structures for volume data selected from the volume data corresponding to the plurality of cardiac phases, stored in the image storage unit 13, under the readout control of the control unit 12, typically volume data corresponding to the end systole (ES) and the end diastole (ED), in which pulsation is relatively small, and the middle phase (MD) between the two cardiac phases, as shown in FIG. 6. The apparatus generates a plurality of coronary artery centerline structures respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases between the end systole (ES) and the middle phase (MD) from coronary artery centerline structures in the end systole (ES) and the middle phase (MD) by interpolation processing, and generates a plurality of coronary artery centerline structures respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases between the end diastole (ED) and the middle phase (MD) from coronary artery centerline structures in the end diastole (ED) and the middle phase (MD) by interpolation processing (S4). The apparatus can improve interpolation accuracy by interpolating centerline structures in other cardiac phases from the centerline structures in the three cardiac phases. This can improve the accuracy of the four-dimensional coronary artery deformation model and the accuracy of fluid analysis processing as compared with the analysis with two cardiac phases. FIG. 7 shows another modification of the procedure in FIG. 2. The same step numbers as in FIG. 2 denote the same steps in FIG. 7, and a description of them will be omitted. In step S14, the apparatus selects volume data to be processed from the volume data respectively corresponding to a plurality of cardiac phases, stored in the image storage unit 13, under the readout control of the control unit 12. The time densities of the volume data selected as data to be processed are irregular, that is, the time intervals between the adjacent volume data are not constant. Typically, the control unit 12 selects volume data with a low density during a period in which a clear image cannot be captured with much blur because of fast movement of the heart. That is, a relatively long time interval is set between the adjacent volume data. In contrast to this, during a period in which a clear image can be captured with less blur because of slow movement of the heart, the apparatus selects volume data with a high density. That is, a relatively short time interval is set between the adjacent volume data. Note that selecting volume data with irregular densities enables the CT apparatus 2 to change the acquisition density of volume data in accordance with a cardiac phase and change all the volume data acquired and stored in this manner into volume data to be processed. The apparatus extracts coronary artery centerline structures from the volume data selected with variable densities corresponding to the movement of the heart (S15), and generates, from these coronary artery centerline structures, a plurality of coronary artery centerline structures respectively corresponding to one or a plurality of cardiac phases between them (S16). This can further improve the interpolation accuracy and reduce the influence of motion artifacts more than by interpolation of centerline structures in other cardiac phases from centerline structures in two or three cardiac phases. This makes it possible to further improve the accuracy of a four-dimensional coronary artery modification model and the accuracy of fluid analysis processing more than the accuracy of analysis with two cardiac phases.
