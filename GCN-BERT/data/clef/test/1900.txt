REEL Field of the Invention This invention relates to a bristle assembly, and apparatus incorporating such a bristle, for performing working operations. The working operations are typically performed on a lawn or on the ground surface, although other operations are also envisaged. Background Art Lawn care involves maintenance such as regular mowing and periodic dethatch^ng. This is particularly the case for lawns used as bowling greens, golf course fairways and putting greens. With regard to lawn care for bowling greens, it is usual for the lawn to be cut regularly, possibly several times each day in an endeavour to maintain the lawn in an appropriate playing condition. Each cutting operation can also involve several passes over the lawn. Accordingly, the maintenance of a lawn in a playing condition can be a very time consuming procedure. The need to make several passes over such a lawn during a mowing operation, and to mow the lawn several times each day, arises because of the nature of the equipment used for the mowing operation. Typically, a conventional reel mower is employed for the mowing operation, involving a driven horizontally mounted cutter reel incorporating a number of circumferentially spaced spiral blades. The cutter reel operates in conjunction with a cutter bar, whereby blades of grass are sliced between the cutter bar and the spiral blades moving relative to the cutter bar. Because of the circumferential spacing between the spiral reels, it is not possible for all blades of grass requiring cutting to be out in a single pass. Consequently, several passes are required In order to provide a lawn In an appropriate playing condition. The lawns also require renovation from time to time, which can involve dethatching or "verti-mowing". The dethatching operation is usually performed using a separate machine to a reel mower, or alternatively a conventional reel mower modified by replacement of the cutter reel with an appropriate tool assembly for performing the necessary renovation operation. An example of a reel and apparatus for performing such working operations is disclosed in International Patent Publication Number WO 2004/049780. It is against this background that the present invention has been developed.

Brief Description of the Drawings In order that the invention may be more fully understood and put info practice, a preferred embodiment thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a schematic side view of an apparatus according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, with the apparatus being configured to perform a lawn mowing operation; Figure 2 is a perspective view of a reel forming part of the apparatus of Figure 1 ; Figure 3 is a fragmentary perspective view of one end of the reel; Figure 4 is a plan view of the reel of Figure 2; Figure 5 is a schematic fragmentary view illustrating the apparatus performing a lawn mowing operation; and Figure 6 is a schematic view of the apparatus configured to perform a dethatching operation. Best Models) for Carrying out the Invention Referring to the drawings, the apparatus 10 according to the embodiment is of a construction similar to a conventional reel mower, comprising a body 11 incorporating a handle 13. The body 11 is supported on two ground-engaging means in the form of rollers, being a smaller front roller IS and a larger rear roller 17. A horizontally disposed reel 19 is supported on the body 11 between the front and rear rollers 15 and 17. The reel IS is driven by way of a drive means which incorporates a motor 20. A mechanism (not shown) is provided for adjusting the height of the reel 19 relative to the rollers 15 and 17. The apparatus 10 can perform various functions, including lawn mowing, lawn renovating such as dethatching, and ground leveling. When the apparatus 10 is configured for lawn mowing operations, it is fitted with a cutter bar 21 which operates in association with the reel 19, as will be explained in more detail later. When the apparatus 10 is set up for certain other operations including dethatching, the cutter bar 21 is removed (as shown in Figure 6). With reference to figures 2, 3 and 4, the reel 19 comprises a central support in the form of a hollow rigid cylinder 23 through which a circular opening 24 extends. The reel 19 is rotatably supported within the body 11 by way of an axle (not depicted) which extends through the opening 24. The reel 19 also includes means (not shown) for receiving rotational drive from the drive means. The reel 19 further comprises a flexible elongate bristle attachment member 25 which includes a bottom wall 26 and a pair of opposing side walls 27 which define a channel 28. Attachment member 25 is wound around the cylinder 23 and is secured to the cylinder 23 such that the member 25 spirals about an axis of rotation of the cylinder 23. A plurality of bristles 29 are secured relative to the attachment member 25 such that the bristles 29 project outwardly from the cylinder 23. The bristles 29 are preferably secured relative to the attachment member 25 before the member 25 is wound around and secured relative to the cylinder 23, The bristles 29 are secured or retained relative to the member 25 by inserting the bristles 29 and an elongate retaining member in the form of a flexible wire 30 into the channel 28 so that the bristles 29 are folded or bent around the wire 30, and so that the ends of the bristles 29 protrude from the channel 28. The side walls 27 of the channel member 25 are folded or bent towards each other so that the wire 30 is captured within the channel 28 and so that the bristles 29 are pinched or clamped between the side walls 27, In this way, the bristles 29 are secured relative to the attachment member 25. In this embodiment, the cylinder 23, attachment member 25, bristles 2S and wire are all fabricated from a suitable metal. Each bristle 29, in particular, is formed of high carbon steel wire. The outer tips of the bristles 29 cooperate to define an outer surface 31, Each outer surface 31 is curved, with the centre of curvature corresponding to the rotational axis of the reel 19. The bristles 29 are of substantially the same length such that their outer surfaces 31 generally occupy a substantially common cylindrical plane When the apparatus 10 is to perform a lawn mowing function, the reel 19 operates in association with the cutter bar 21, as alluded to earlier. The rotating reel 19 is positioned relative to the cutter bar 21 so as to sweep in close contact with the leading edge section of the cutter bar 21. Over a period of time, the cutter bar 21 will wear to conform generally to the circular profile of the outer periphery of the reel 19, such wear being depicted in Figure 1 of the drawings at zone 40. The lawn cutting operation is performed by subjecting the grass blades to a shearing action between the cutter bar 21 and the rotating bristles 29. More particularly, a grass blade can be carried by a respective one of the bristles 29 to the cutter bar 21 and then subjected to a shearing action by interaction between the bristle 29 and the cutter bar 21 as the bristle 29 sweeps over the cutter bar 21 during rotation of the reel 19. Because of the multitude of bristles 29 employed in the reel 19, there is little chance of any grass blade not being cut In a single pass of the reel 19. Consequently, a more efficient cutting operation is provided in comparison to that available with a conventional reel having spiral blades which requires at least several passes to perform an appropriate mowing operation. The bristles 29 on the reel 19 also enhance the grass catching aspect of the mowing operation, as they tend to sweep the cut surface and thus carry cut grass towards a grass catching zone within the apparatus 10, As mentioned above, the apparatus 10 according to the embodiment can perform working operations other than lawn mowing. One such operation is lawn renovation involving dethatching. To perform such an operation, the cutter bar 21 is removed from the apparatus 10, as shown in Figure 6, The height of the reel 19 is then adjusted with respect to the front and rear rollers 15, 17 to the desired level according to the nature of the renovation operation to be performed. Where a light renovation is required, the reel 19 can he set relatively high to the lawn surface, with the result that the reel 19 sweeps over the lawn surface to perform the light renovating procedure. On the other hand, where an aggressive renovation is desired, the reel 19 is lowered so as to more aggressively contact the lawn and possibly also soil beneath the lawn. It has been found that the action of the rotating bristles 29 on the lawn provides a highly effective dethatching action. The reel 19 can also be used to remove lawn from an area by appropriate setting of the level of the reel 19 with respect to the ground. In such an instance, It is likely that the reel 19 would be set to a level below that of the actual ground surface. While not shown in the drawings, the apparatus 10 can also be used to perform a ground working operation such as leveling. In such an application, the rotating reel 19 is moved across the area to be worked to remove bumps and crests in the ground surface. While the invention has been described with reference to one specific embodiment, it is not limited thereto. By way of example, While the embodiment has been described with reference to bristles 29 formed of steel wire, it should be understood that bristles 29 of any other appropriate material may be employed. Apparatus according to the invention may also be employed for other operations, including sweeping and materials dispersal (such as snow clearing) utilising the rotating reel. Additionally, apparatus according to the invention may be used for materials collection such as, for example, collection of debris on the ground. In such an application, the rotating reel would be passed over the ground to make contact with the debris and throw it into an associated collection receptacle. it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that variations and modifications to the invention described herein will be apparent without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
