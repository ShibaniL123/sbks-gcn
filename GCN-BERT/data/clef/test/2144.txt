BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Retinal detachment is a disorder of the eye in which the retina peels away from its underlying layer of support tissue. When the retina becomes detached, bleeding from area blood vessels may cloud the inside of the eye, which is normally filled with vitreous fluid. Central vision becomes severely affected if the macula, the part of the retina responsible for fine vision, becomes detached. The most common types of retinal detachments are often due to a tear or hole in the retina. Eye fluids may leak through this opening. This causes the retina to separate from the underlying tissues, much like a bubble under wallpaper. This is most often caused by a condition called posterior vitreous detachment. Another type of retinal detachment is called tractional detachment. This is seen in people who have uncontrolled diabetes, previous retinal surgery, or have chronic inflammation. If not treated in time, it results in blindness. Initial detachment may be localized, but without rapid treatment the entire retina may detach, leading to vision loss and blindness. Most people with a retinal detachment will need surgery. Surgery may be done immediately or after a short period of time.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The current method for treating retinal detachment involves surgery followed by suturing or laser treatment followed by filling the eye interior with an inert gas or silicon oil. The post operation results in the intraocular pressure inside and there is no vision for 2-4 weeks. If filled with the inert gas, the travel is also not possible during this period due to the possible change in the atmospheric pressure at the new location. However, if the cavity is filled with silicone oil, then another surgery is required to remove the silicon oil after the healing process is complete. In addition, the current retinal patches are difficult to make stay in place while the current commercially available adhesives do not bond well to the retina and are difficult to deliver to the site. Therefore, herein is provided a family of in vivo gelling biocompatible ophthalmic pre-formulations that can be injected at or near the affected area using a narrow bore needles and that form biocompatible retinal patches. Once the target location has been identified inside the eye, an exact volume of the reacting mixture is injected inside. Once on site, the liquid wets the surface of the retina and fills the hole. After a preset time, the liquid turns into a solid and bonds the two layers together and attaches the retina and also fills the hole forming a retinal patch. The viscosity of the formulations is controlled such that the liquid remains localized at the target site. In some embodiments, the in vivo gelling biocompatible ophthalmic pre-formulation also adheres to the site in the eye. In certain embodiment, the viscosity and stickiness of the in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation is suitable for easy delivery to the site through a narrow bore needle, while at the same time staying in place at the site of the retinal tear and adhering to the tissue surrounding the retinal tear. In some embodiments, the in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulations comprise viscosity enhancers to ensure that the pre-formulation remains at and/or adheres to the target site in the eye during the gelling process. The physicochemical properties of the biopolymer are matched with the surrounding tissues and the retina, so that there is little change in pressure from the natural atmosphere. In further embodiments, an in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation to form a biocompatible retinal patch enables the administration of medication directly to the vitreous. The polymer starts out as a liquid pre-formulation and is delivered, together with one or more optional therapeutic agents, to the site of a disease using minimally invasive techniques. Once in the eye, the liquid pre-formulation polymerizes into a solid hydrogel that in some instances adheres to the tissue and keeps the polymer/drug combination at the site of the disease. In some instances, polymerization and degradation times are controlled by varying the composition of the monomers and buffers allowing for the appropriate application and placement of the hydrogel polymer. In some embodiments, the drug is released in a precise and consistent manner. In certain instances, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is bioabsorbed over a defined period of time. In some embodiments, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer provides the sustained release of a therapeutic agent at a target site. In certain embodiments, the sustained and controlled release reduces the systemic exposure to the therapeutic agent. The controlled gelling and biodegradation allows the use of the biocompatible hydrogel polymer to deliver one or more therapeutic agents directly to the tissue affected by a disease, thereby minimizing systemic exposure to the therapeutic agent. In some instances, the therapeutic agent is released from the biocompatible hydrogel polymer over an extended period of time. In certain instances, delivery of the therapeutic agent in a biocompatible hydrogel polymer provides a depot of the therapeutic agent (e.g., under the skin), wherein the depot releases the therapeutic agent over an extended period of time (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10, days, 14 days, 3 week, 4 week). In some instances, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer releases the therapeutic agent after a delay as a delayed burst. In some embodiments, an in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation completely replaces the vitreous humour of an eye. In certain embodiments, the in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation partially replaces the vitreous humour of an eye. The in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulations are useful to treat retinal detachment and other conditions of the eye. Delivering an in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation to the site of a retinal tear in an eye, the pre-formulation at least in part polymerizes and/or gels at the site of the retinal tear in the eye and forms a retinal patch. The retinal patch at least partially adheres to the retinal tear and closes the hole treating the retinal detachment and allowing it to heal. Furthermore, the in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulations are useful to deliver therapeutic agents to the inside of the eye to treat conditions of the eye, for example age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, cataract, intra-ocular pressure (glaucoma), or proliferative vitreoretinopathy.

In certain embodiments, the gelling time or curing time of the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is controlled by the selection of the first and second compounds. In some embodiments, the concentration of nucleophilic or electrophilic groups in the first or second compound influences the gelling time of the in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation. In some embodiments, curing of the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is verified post-administration. In certain embodiments, the verification is performed in vivo at the delivery site. In other embodiments, the verification is performed ex vivo. In some embodiments, curing of the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is verified visually. A lack of flow of the biocompatible hydrogel polymer indicates that the biocompatible hydrogel polymer has gelled and the hydrogel is sufficiently cured. In further embodiments, curing of the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is verified by evaluation of the residue in the delivery device, for instance the residue in the catheter of the bronchoscope or other endoscopic device, or the residue in the syringe used to deliver the biocompatible hydrogel polymer. In other embodiments, curing of the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is verified by depositing a small sample (e.g., ห1 mL) on a piece of paper or in a small vessel and subsequent evaluation of the flow characteristics after the gelling time has passed. In some embodiments, the in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation optionally comprising one or more therapeutic agents is delivered to the target site so that the pre-formulation mostly covers the target site. In certain embodiments, the in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation substantially covers an exposed portion of diseased tissue. In some embodiments, the in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation does not spread to any other location intentionally. In some embodiments, the in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation substantially covers diseased tissue and does not significantly cover healthy tissue. In certain embodiments, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer does not significantly cover healthy tissue. In some embodiments, in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation gels over the target site and thoroughly covers diseased tissue. In some embodiments, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer adheres to tissue. Bioabsorbance of the Hydrogel In some embodiments, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is a bioabsorbable polymer. In certain embodiments, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is bioabsorbed within about 5 to 30 days. In some embodiments, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is bioabsorbed within about 30 to 180 days. In preferred embodiments, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is bioabsorbed within about 1 to 70 days. In some embodiments the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is bioabsorbed within about 365 days, 180 days, about 150 days, about 120 days, about 90 days, about 80 days, about 70 days, about 60 days, about 50 days, about 40 days, about 35 days, about 30 days, about 28 days, about 21 days, about 14 days, about 10 days, about 7 days, about 6 days, about 5 days, about 4 days, about 3 days, about 2 days, or about 1 day. In certain embodiments the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is bioabsorbed within less than 365 days, 180 days, less than 150 days, less than 120 days, less than 90 days, less than 80 days, less than 70 days, less than 60 days, less than 50 days, less than 40 days, less than 35 days, less than 30 days, less than 28 days, less than 21 days, less than 14 days, less than 10 days, less than 7 days, less than 6 days, less than 5 days, less than 4 days, less than 3 days, less than 2 days, or less than 1 day. In some embodiments the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is bioabsorbed within more than 365 days, 180 days, more than 150 days, more than 120 days, more than 90 days, more than 80 days, more than 70 days, more than 60 days, more than 50 days, more than 40 days, more than 35 days, more than 30 days, more than 28 days, more than 21 days, more than 14 days, more than 10 days, more than 7 days, more than 6 days, more than 5 days, more than 4 days, more than 3 days, more than 2 days, or more than 1 day. In some embodiments, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer is substantially non-bioabsorbable. The biocompatible hydrogel polymer is slowly bioabsorbed, dissolved, and or excreted. In some instances, the rate of bioabsorption is controlled by the number of ester groups in the biocompatible and/or biodegradable hydrogel polymer. In other instances, the higher the concentration of ester units is in the biocompatible hydrogel polymer, the longer is its lifetime in the body. In further instances, the electron density at the carbonyl of the ester unit controls the lifetime of the hydrogel polymer in the body. In certain instances, biocompatible hydrogel polymers without ester groups are essentially not biodegradable. In additional instances, the molecular weight of the first and second compounds controls the lifetime of the hydrogel polymer in the body. In further instances, the number of ester groups per gram of polymer controls the lifetime of the hydrogel polymer in the body. In some instances, the lifetime of the hydrogel polymer can be estimated using a model, which controls the temperature and pH at physiological levels while exposing the hydrogel polymer to a buffer solution. In certain instances, the biodegradation of the hydrogel polymer is substantially non-enzymatic degradation. In some embodiments, the selection of reaction conditions determines the degradation time of the hydrogel polymer. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the first compound and second compound monomers determines the degradation time of the resulting hydrogel polymer. In some instances, a higher monomer concentration leads to a higher degree of cross-linking in the resulting hydrogel polymer. In certain instances, more cross-linking leads to a later degradation of the hydrogel polymer. In certain embodiments, the composition of the linker in the first and/or second compound influences the speed of degradation of the resulting hydrogel polymer. In some embodiments, the more ester groups are present in the hydrogel polymer, the faster the degradation of the hydrogel polymer. In certain embodiments, the higher the concentration of mercaptopropionate (ETTMP), acetate amine (AA), glutarate or succinate (SG or SS) monomers, the faster the rate of degradation.

In certain embodiments, the retinal patch, retinal glue, or retinal suture gels at least in part at the target site inside the eye. In some embodiments, the retinal patch, retinal glue, or retinal suture gels at least in part at a retinal tear inside the eye. In certain embodiments, the retinal patch, retinal glue, or retinal suture polymerizes at least in part at the target site inside the eye. In some embodiments, the retinal patch, retinal glue, or retinal suture polymerizes at least in part at a retinal tear inside the eye. In some embodiments, the retinal patch, retinal glue, or retinal suture adheres at least partially to the target site. In certain embodiments, the in vivo gelling hydrogel polymer is used as a โliquid sutureโ or as a drug delivery platform to transport medications directly to the targeted site in the eye. In some embodiments, the spreadability, viscosity, optical clarity, and adhesive properties of the hydrogel formulation are optimized to create materials ideal as liquid sutures for the treatment of retinal detachment (re-attachment of detached retina). In certain embodiments, the gel time is controlled from 50 seconds to 15 minutes. Control of Release Rate of a Therapeutic Agent In some embodiments, the biocompatible hydrogel polymer slowly delivers a therapeutic agent to a target site by diffusion and/or osmosis over time ranging from hours to days. In certain embodiments, the drug is delivered directly to the target site. In some embodiments, the procedure of delivering a biocompatible hydrogel polymer comprising a therapeutic agent to a target site is repeated several times, if needed. In other embodiments, the therapeutic agent is released from the biocompatible hydrogel polymer through biodegradation of the hydrogel polymer. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is released through a combination of diffusion, osmosis, and/or hydrogel degradation mechanisms. In certain embodiments, the release profile of the therapeutic agent from the hydrogel polymer is unimodal. In some embodiments, the release profile of the therapeutic agent from the hydrogel polymer is bimodal. In certain embodiments, the release profile of the therapeutic agent from the hydrogel polymer is multimodal. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is released from the biocompatible hydrogel polymer though diffusion or osmosis. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent is substantially released from the biocompatible hydrogel polymer within 180 days. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is substantially released from the biocompatible hydrogel polymer within 14 days.

In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent is substantially released from the biocompatible hydrogel polymer within less than 180 days, less than 150 days, less than 120 days, less than 90 days, less than 80 days, less than 70 days, less than 60 days, less than 50 days, less than 40 days, less than 35 days, less than 30 days, less than 28 days, less than 21 days, less than 14 days, less than 10 days, less than 7 days, less than 6 days, less than 5 days, less than 4 days, less than 3 days, less than 2 days, less than 1 day, less than 0.5 day, less than 6 hours, less than 4 hours, less than 2 hours, less than or 1 hour. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is substantially released from the biocompatible hydrogel polymer within about one day to about fourteen days. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent is substantially released from the biocompatible hydrogel polymer within about one day to about 70 days. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is a biomolecule and the release of the biomolecule from the hydrogel polymer is controlled by the composition of the hydrogel polymer. In certain embodiments, the biomolecule is released when the hydrogel polymer starts to degrade. In some embodiments, the pore size of the hydrogel polymer is small enough to prevent the early phase release of the biomolecule (i.e., release before the degradation of the hydrogel polymer). In certain embodiments, the pore size of the hydrogel polymer is large enough to allow the early phase release of the biomolecule. In some embodiments, the ratio of the pore size of the hydrogel polymer to the size of the biomolecule determines the release rate of the biomolecule.

Additionally, the viscosity should be high enough to prevent excessive spreading around the target treatment area, but low enough to enter any small cavities at the site. Furthermore, the reaction buffers should be close to physiological conditions. The desired degradation time and polymer pore size will vary based on the application. The polymer should be elastic and strong enough to resist fragmentation in the body. The chemical components of the polymers are listed in Table 1. The chemical monomers will be referred to by their abbreviations. Several USP grade ophthalmic use approved viscosity enhancing agents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were stored at 25ยฐ C. They include methylcellulose (Methocelยฎ MC, 10-25 MPAยทS) abbreviated as MC; hypromellose (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 2910) abbreviated as HPMC; and povidone K-30 (polyvinylpyrrolidone) abbreviated as PVP. The monomers were stored at 5ยฐ C. and allowed to warm to room temperature before use, which typically took 30 minutes. After use the contents were purged with N2 for approximately 30 seconds before sealing with parafilm and returning to 5ยฐ C. A 0.15 M phosphate buffer was made by dissolving 9.00 g (0.075 mol) NaH2PO4 in 500 mL of distilled water at 25ยฐ C. with magnetic stirring. The pH was then adjusted to 7.99 with the dropwise addition of 50% aqueous NaOH. Several other phosphate buffers were prepared in a similar fashion: 0.10 M phosphate at pH 9, 0.10 M phosphate at pH 7.80, 0.10 M phosphate at 7.72, 0.10 M phosphate at pH 7.46, 0.15 M phosphate at pH 7.94, 0.15 M phosphate at pH 7.90, 0.4 M phosphate at pH 9, and 0.05 M phosphate at pH 7.40. A sterile 0.10 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.58 with 0.30% HPMC was prepared for use in kits. First, 1.417 g HPMC was dissolved in 471 mL of 0.10 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.58 by vigorous shaking. The viscous solution was allowed to clarify overnight. The solution was filtered through a 0.22 ฮผm filter (Corning #431097) with application of light vacuum. The viscosity of the resulting solution was measured to be 8.48 cSt+/โ0.06 at 20ยฐ C. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was prepared by dissolving two PBS tablets (Sigma Chemical, P4417) in 400 mL of distilled water at 25ยฐ C. with vigorous shaking. The solution has the following composition and pH: 0.01 M phosphate, 0.0027 M potassium chloride, 0.137 M sodium chloride, pH 7.46. A 0.058 M phosphate buffer was made by dissolving 3.45 g (0.029 mol) of NaH2PO4 in 500 mL of distilled water at 25ยฐ C. with magnetic stirring. The pH was then adjusted to 7.97 with the dropwise addition of 50% aqueous NaOH. A 0.05 M borate buffer was made by dissolving 9.53 g (0.025 mol) of Na2B4O7.10 H2O in 500 mL of distilled water at 25ยฐ C. with magnetic stirring. The pH was then adjusted to 7.93 or 8.35 with the dropwise addition of 6.0 N HCl. The amine or thiol component (typically in the range of 0.1 mmol arms equivalents) was added to a 50 mL centrifuge tube. A volume of reaction buffer was added to the tube via a pipette such that the final concentration of solids in solution was about 5 percent. The mixture was gently swirled to dissolve the solids before adding the appropriate amount of ester or epoxide. Immediately after adding the ester or epoxide, the entire solution was shaken for 10 seconds before letting it rest. The gel time for all cases was measured starting from the addition of the ester or epoxide until the gelation of the solution. The gel point was noted by pipetting 1 mL of the reaction mixture and observing the dropwise increase in viscosity. Degradation of the polymers was performed by the addition of 5 to 10 mL of phosphate buffered saline to ca. 5 g of the material in a 50 mL centrifuge tube and incubating the mixture at 37ยฐ C. The degradation time was measured starting from the day of addition of the phosphate buffer to complete dissolution of the polymer into solution. TABLE 1 Components used in formulations.

The mixture was shaken for about 10 seconds at ambient temperature until complete dissolution was obtained. The Falcon tube was allowed to stand at ambient temperature. In another Falcon tube, 0.10 g of 8ARM-15K-SG was dissolved in the same phosphate buffer as above. The mixture was shaken for about 10 seconds and at this point all the powder dissolved. The 8ARM-15K-SG solution was poured immediately into the 8ARM-20K-NH2 solution and a timer was started. The mixture was shaken and mixed for about 10 seconds and a 1 mL solution of the mixture was pipetted out using a mechanical high precision pipette. The gel time of 1 mL liquid was collected and then verified with the lack of flow for the remaining liquids. The gel time data of the formulation was recorded and was about 90 seconds. Example 2 Manufacture of Hydrogel (Amine-Ester Chemistry) A solution of amines was prepared in a Falcon tube by dissolving about 0.4 g solid 4ARM-20k-AA and about 0.2 g solid 8ARM-20k-NH2 in about 18 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (buffer pH 7.36). The mixture was shaken for about 10 seconds at ambient temperature until complete dissolution was obtained. The Falcon tube was allowed to stand at ambient temperature. To this solution, 0.3 g of 8ARM-15K-SG was added. The mixture was shaken to mix for about 10 seconds until all the powder dissolved. 1 mL of the mixture was pipetted out using a mechanical high precision pipette. The gel time of the formulation was collected using the process described above. The gel time was about 90 seconds. Example 3 Manufacture of Hydrogel (Thiol-Ester Chemistry A solution of ETTMP-1300 was prepared in a Falcon tube by dissolving about 0.04 g monomer in about 5 mL of sodium borate buffer (buffer pH 8.35). The mixture was shaken for about 10 seconds at ambient temperature until complete dissolution was obtained. The Falcon tube was allowed to stand at ambient temperature. To this solution, 0.20 g of 8ARM-15K-SG was added. The mixture was shaken for about 10 seconds until the powder dissolved. 1 mL of the mixture was pipetted out using a mechanical high precision pipette. The gel time was found to be about 70 seconds. Example 4 Manufacture of Hydrogel (Thiol-Epoxide Chemistry) A solution of ETTMP-1300 was prepared in a Falcon tube by dissolving about 0.04 g monomer in about 5 mL of sodium borate buffer (buffer pH 8.35). The mixture was shaken for about 10 seconds at ambient temperature until complete dissolution was obtained. The Falcon tube was allowed to stand at ambient temperature. To this solution, 0.10 g of EJ-190 was added. The mixture was shaken for about 10 seconds until complete dissolution is obtained. 1 mL of the mixture was pipetted out using a mechanical high precision pipette. The gel time was found to be about 6 minutes. Example 5 In vitro Bioabsorbance Testing A 0.10 molar buffer solution of pH 7.40 was prepared with deionized water. A 50 mL portion of this solution was transferred to a Falcon tube. A sample polymer was prepared in a 20 cc syringe. After curing, a 2-4 mm thick slice was cut from the polymer slug and was placed in the Falcon tube. A circulating water bath was prepared and maintained at 37ยฐ C. The Falcon tube with polymer was placed inside the water bath and time was started. The dissolution of the polymer was monitored and recorded. The dissolution time ranged from 1-90 days depending on the type of sample polymer. Example 6 Gelling and Degradation Times of Amine-Ester Polymers Amines studied were 8ARM-20k-NH2 and 4ARM-5k-NH2. The formulation details and material properties are given in Table 2. With 8ARM-20k-NH2, it was found that a phosphate buffer with 0.058 M phosphate and pH of 7.97 was necessary to obtain acceptable gel times of around 100 seconds. Using a 0.05 M phosphate buffer with a pH of 7.41 resulted in a more than two-fold increase in gel time (270 seconds). With the 8ARM-20k-NH2, the ratio of 4ARM-10k-SS to 4ARM-20k-SGA was varied from 50:50 to 90:10. The gel time remained consistent, but there was a marked shift in degradation time around a ratio of 80:20. For formulations with ratios of 75:25 and 50:50, degradation times spiked to one month and beyond. Using lower amounts of 4ARM-20k-SGA (80:20, 85:15, 90:10) resulted in degradation times of less than 7 days. As a comparison, the 4ARM-5k-NH2 was used in a formulation with a ratio of 4ARM-10k-SS to 4ARM-20k-SGA of 80:20. As was expected, the degradation time remained consistent, which suggests that the mechanism of degradation was unaffected by the change in amine. However, the gel time increased by 60 seconds, which may reflect the relative accessibility of reactive groups in a high molecular weight 8ARM amine and a low molecular weight 4ARM amine.

The formulation details and material properties are given in Table 3. It was found that a 0.05 M borate buffer with a pH of 7.93 produced gel times of around 120 seconds. Increasing the amount of 4ARM-20k-SGA in the formulation increased the gel time to 190 seconds (25:75 ratio of 4ARM-10k-SS to 4ARM-20k-SGA) up to 390 seconds (0:100 ratio of 4ARM-10k-SS to 4ARM-20k-SGA). Using a 0.05 M borate buffer with a pH of 8.35 resulted in a gel time of 65 seconds, about a two-fold decrease in gel time. Thus, the gel time may be tailored by simply adjusting the pH of the reaction buffer. The ratio of 4ARM-10k-SS to 4ARM-20k-SGA was varied from 0:100 to 100:0. In all cases, the degradation time did not vary significantly and was typically between 3 and 5 days. It is likely that degradation is occurring via alternate pathways.

The formulation details and material properties are given in Table 4. A 0.058 M phosphate buffer with a pH of 7.97 yielded a gel time of 150 seconds with the amine. A 0.05 M borate buffer with a pH of 8.35 produced a gel time of 75 seconds with the thiol. The amine-based polymer appeared to show no signs of degradation, as was expected from the lack of degradable groups. However, the thiol-based polymer degraded in 5 days. This suggests that degradation is occurring through alternate pathways, as was observed in the thiol formulations with 4ARM-10k-SS and 4ARM-20k-SGA (vida supra).

Gel times ranged from around 30 minutes to many hours. The conditions that were explored include: pH from 7 to 12; solution concentration from 5% to 50%; borate concentration from 0.05 M to 0.16 M; and thiol to epoxide ratios from 1:2 to 2:1. The high pH necessary for the reaction to occur could result in degradation of the thiol. Thus, a polymer with EJ-190 and 4ARM-5k-SH was prepared. A 13% solution formulation exhibited a gel time of 230 seconds at a pH of between 9 and 10. The degradation time was 32 days. At a lower pH of around 8, the mixture exhibited gel times in the range of 1 to 2 hours. Example 10 General Procedure for the Preparation of In Vivo Polymerizable Materials Several representative sticky formulations are listed in Table 5 along with specific reaction details for the preparation of in vivo polymerizable materials. The polymers were prepared by first dissolving the amine component in phosphate buffer or the thiol component in borate buffer. The appropriate amount of the ester component was then added and the entire solution was mixed vigorously for 10 to 20 seconds. The gel time was measured starting from the addition of the ester until the gelation of the solution.

An example of gel time control for a single formulation is shown in Table 6, where the gel time for the 8ARM-20k-NH2/4ARM-20k-SGA (1/1) polymer was varied from 1.5 to 15.5 minutes. In some instances, the stickiness of the polymers originates from a mismatching in the molar equivalents of the components. A variety of sticky materials using combinations of 4 or 8 armed amines of molecular weights between 2 and 20 thousand and 4 or 8 armed esters of molecular weights between 10 and 20 thousand were created. It was found that in comparison with the 8 armed esters, the 4 armed esters resulted in stickier materials. For the amine component, it was found that smaller molecular weights led to stickier materials and higher amine to ester molar ratios. A mismatch (amine to ester molar ratio) of at least 3 was required to qualitatively sense stickiness. More preferably, a ratio of around 5 produced a desirable level of stickiness combined with polymer strength. Polymers with amine to ester molar ratios higher than 5 may be formed as well, but some reaction conditions, such as the polymer concentration, may need to be adjusted to obtain a reasonable gel time. Furthermore, it was found that the use of a viscosity enhanced solution improves the polymers by increasing their strength and elasticity, allowing for higher amine to ester molar ratios (Example 11, Table 8). The materials formed were typically transparent and elastic. Stickiness was tested for qualitatively by touch. Thus, a sticky material adhered to a human finger or other surface and remained in place until removed. Degradation times varied from 1 to 53 days. In certain instances, the polymer properties, such as gel and degradation times, pore sizes, swelling, etc. may be optimized for different applications without losing the stickiness. Example 11 General Procedure for the Preparation of Solutions with Enhanced Viscosity Polymer solutions with enhanced viscosities were prepared by the addition of a viscosity enhancing agent to the reaction buffer. Table 8B lists the viscosity enhancing agents studied, including observations on the properties of the formed polymers. Stock solutions of reaction buffers were prepared with varying concentrations of methylcellulose (MC), hypromellose (HPMC) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). As an example, a 2% (w/w) HPMC solution in buffer was made by adding 0.2 g of HPMC to 9.8 mL of 0.10 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.80, followed by vigorous shaking. The solution was allowed to stand overnight. Buffer solutions with HPMC concentrations ranging from 0.01% to 2.0% were prepared in a similar fashion. Buffer solutions with PVP concentrations ranging from 5% to 20% and buffer solutions with MC concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 2.0% were also prepared by a similar method. The polymers were formed in the same method as described above in the general procedures for the preparation of the sticky materials (Example 10). A typical procedure involved first dissolving the amine component in the phosphate buffer containing the desired concentration of viscosity enhancing agent. The appropriate amount of the ester component was then added and the entire solution was mixed vigorously for 10 to 20 seconds. The gel time was measured starting from the addition of the ester until the gelation of the solution. Several representative formulations are listed in Table 7 along with specific reaction details. The percent of degradable acetate amine component by mole equivalents is represented by a ratio designated in parenthesis. For example, a formulation with 75% degradable amine will be written as 8ARM-20k-AA/8ARM-20k-NH2 (75/25). The polymer was prepared by first dissolving the amine component in phosphate buffer. The appropriate amount of the ester component was then added and the entire solution was mixed vigorously for 10 to 20 seconds. The gel time was measured starting from the addition of the ester until the gelation of the solution. The gel time is dependent on several factors: pH, buffer concentration, polymer concentration, temperature and the monomers used. Previous experiments have shown that the extent of mixing has little effect on the gel time once the components are in solution, which typically takes up to 10 seconds. FIG. 1 shows the effect of monomer addition on buffer pH. For the 8ARM-20k-NH2 & 4ARM-20k-SGA formulation, the buffer pH drops slightly from 7.42 to 7.36 upon addition of the monomers. For the 8ARM-20k-AA/8ARM-20k-NH2 (70/30) & 4ARM-20k-SGA formulation, the buffer pH drops from 7.4 to 7.29 upon addition of the monomers. The additional decrease in the pH was found to originate from acidic residues in the degradable acetate amine. The same pH drop phenomenon was observed for the 4ARM-20k-AA amine. In certain instances, a quality control specification on the acetate amine solution pH may be required to improve the consistency of degradable formulations. FIG. 2 depicts the effect of reaction buffer pH on gel times. The gel times increase with an increase in the concentration of hydronium ions in an approximately linear fashion. More generally, the gel times decrease with an increase in the buffer pH. FIG. 3 shows the effect of reaction buffer phosphate concentration on gel times. The gel times decrease with an increase in the phosphate concentration. FIG. 4 illustrates the effect of polymer concentration on gel times. The gel times decrease significantly with an increase in the polymer concentration. At low polymer concentrations where the gel time is greater than 5 minutes, hydrolysis reactions of the ester begin to compete with the formation of the polymer. The effect of temperature on gel times appears to follow the Arrhenius equation, as seen in FIG. 5. The gel time is directly related to the extent of reaction of the polymer solution and so this behavior is not unusual. In FIG. 6, the rheology of the polymers during the gelation process is shown as a function of the percent time to the gel point. Thus, 100% represents the gel point and 50% represents half the time before the gel point. The viscosity of the reacting solution remains relatively constant until about 80% of the gel point. After that point, the viscosity increases dramatically, representing the formation of the solid gel. FIG. 7 shows the gel time stability of a single formulation using the same lot of monomers over the course of about a year. The monomers were handled according to the standard protocol outlined above. The gel times remained relatively stable; some variations in the reaction buffer may account for differences in the gel times.

Cytotoxic effects were evaluated according to ISO 10993-5 guidelines. Hemolysis was evaluated according to procedures based on ASTM F756 and ISO 10993-4. The polymer 8ARM-20k-NH2 & 4ARM-20k-SGA at 4.8% solution with 0.3% HPMC was found to be non-cytotoxic and non-hemolytic. The polymer 8ARM-20k-AA/8ARM-20k-NH2 (70/30) & 4ARM-20k-SGA at 4.8% solution with 0.3% HPMC was found to be non-cytotoxic and non-hemolytic. In addition, formulations involving 4ARM-20kAA and 8ARM-15k-SG were also non-cytotoxic and non-hemolytic. Gel and Degradation Time Measurements The gel time for all cases was measured starting from the addition of the ester until the gelation of the solution. The gel point was noted by pipetting 1 mL of the reaction mixture and observing the dropwise increase in viscosity until the mixture ceased to flow. Degradation of the polymers was performed by the addition of 1 to 10 mL of phosphate buffered saline per 1 g of the material in a 50 mL centrifuge tube and incubating the mixture at 37ยฐ C. A digital water bath was used to maintain the temperature. The degradation time was measured starting from the day of addition of the phosphate buffer to complete dissolution of the polymer into solution. The effect of reaction buffer pH, phosphate concentration, polymer concentration and reaction temperature on the gel times were characterized. The buffer pH was varied from 7.2 to 8.0 by the dropwise addition of either 50% aqueous NaOH or 6.0 N HCl. Phosphate concentrations of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.05 M were prepared and adjusted to pH 7.4. Polymer concentrations from 2 to 20% solution were studied. Reaction temperatures of 5, 20, and 37ยฐ C. were tested by keeping the monomers, buffers, and reaction mixture at the appropriate temperature. The 5ยฐ C. environment was provided by a refrigerator and the 37ยฐ C. temperature was maintained via the water bath. Room temperature was found to be 20ยฐ C. The effect of degradation buffer pH and the proportion of degradable amine in the polymer formulation on the degradation times were explored. The degradation buffer pH was varied from 7.2 to 9.0 by the dropwise addition of either 50% aqueous NaOH or 6.0 N HCl. The degradable amine components studied were either the 4ARM-20k-AA or the 8ARM-20k-AA, and the percent of degradable amine relative to the non-degradable amine was varied from 50 to 100%. The degradation time is largely dependent on the buffer pH, temperature, and the monomers used. Degradation occurs primarily through ester bond hydrolysis; in biological systems, enzymatic pathways may also play a role. FIG. 8 compares the degradation times of formulations with 4ARM-20k-AA and 8ARM-20k-AA in varying amounts. In general, increasing the amount of degradable acetate amine in relation to the non-degradable amine decreases the degradation times. Additionally, in some instances, the 8ARM-20k-AA exhibits a longer degradation time than the 4ARM-20k-AA per mole equivalent, which becomes especially apparent when the percent of acetate amine drops below 70%. FIG. 9 shows the effect of the buffer pH on the degradation time. The pH range between 7.2 and 9.0 was studied. In general, a high pH environment results in a greatly accelerated degradation. For example, an increase in pH from approximately 7.4 to 7.7 decreases the degradation time by about half. The monomers used in the formulations have also been found to play a role in the way the polymer degrades. For the 8ARM-20k-AA/8ARM-20k-NH2 (70/30) & 4ARM-20k-SGA polymer, degradation occurred homogeneously throughout the material, resulting in a โsmoothโ degradation process, which is depicted in FIGS. 10A, 10B, 10C, and 10D. The initial state of the polymer is shown in FIG. 10A. The polymer absorbed water and swelled slightly over the initial few days (FIG. 10B). Then, the polymer became gradually softer yet maintained its shape (FIG. 10C). Finally, the polymer lost its shape and became a highly viscous fluid (FIG. 10D). The 70/30 formulation was chosen for the 14 day ophthalmic application despite its 21 day degradation time because the polymer maintained its shape up to day 14. From day 14 up to day 21, the polymer began to lose its shape and entered the viscous fluid stage. Examples of fragmenting degradation processes are shown in FIGS. 11A and 11B. When the amount of degradable amine becomes low, non-degradable regions in the polymer may occur. FIG. 11A depicts the 8ARM-20k-AA/8ARM-20k-NH2 (60/40) & 4ARM-20k-SGA formulation after approximately 80 days. FIG. 11B depicts the 4ARM-20k-AA/8ARM-20k-NH2 (70/30) & 4ARM-20k-SGA formulation, which degraded into several large fragments. For applications where the polymers are subjected to great forces, fragmentation may also occur as the polymer becomes softer and weaker over time. Polymer Concentration More dilute polymer solutions may be employed with minimal changes in the mechanical properties. For the formulation 8ARM-20k-AA-20K/8ARM-20k-NH2 (75/25) with 4ARM-20k-SGA and 0.3% HPMC, polymer concentrations of 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0% were studied. FIG. 12A shows the gel times, which increased steadily as the polymer concentration was lowered. The firmness decreased slightly as the polymer concentration was lowered (FIG. 12B). The tack is shown in FIG. 12C. There was essentially no change in the polymer adhesive properties. The elastic modulus decreased slightly as the polymer concentration was lowered (FIG. 12D). The swelling or water uptake is shown in FIG. 12E.

Water is in category 3. Methylcellulose (MC) was found to behave similarly to hypromellose (HPMC) and provided workable viscous solutions in the concentration range of 0 to 2% (w/w). However, the HPMC dissolved more readily than the MC, and the HPMC solutions possessed greater optical clarity; thus the use of HPMC was favored. Povidone (PVP) dissolved easily in the buffer, but provided minimal viscosity enhancement even at 20% (w/w). For the most part, the polymers remain unchanged by the addition of low concentrations of HPMC or PVP. However, there was a noticeable change in the polymer around 0.3% HPMC that was characterized by an enhanced elasticity, as evidenced by the ability of the material to elongate more than usual without breakage. Above 1.5% HPMC, the polymer became slightly softer and exhibited less bounce. The gel times also remained within 10 seconds of the gel time for the formulation with no viscous agent. In the case of PVP, significant changes in the polymer occurred above 10% PVP. The polymer became more opaque with a noticeable increase in elasticity and stickiness. At 15% to 20% PVP, the polymer became similar to the sticky materials, but with a better mechanical strength. The gel times also increased by roughly 20 seconds relative to the formulation with no viscous agent. Thus, the addition of lower concentrations of PVP or HPMC to the polymer solutions may be beneficial in improving the polymer's elasticity and lubricity. The results of the hydrogel surface spread test show that most formulations belong in category 2. Based on the these observations, a formulation utilizing 0.3% HPMC was chosen for further evaluation. Above 1.0% HPMC, the solutions became significantly more difficult to mix and dissolution of the monomers became an issue. At 0.5% HPMC and above, the formation of air bubbles during mixing became significant. Furthermore, the solutions were not easily filtered through a 0.5 ฮผm syringe filter to remove the bubbles. However, the 0.3% HPMC solution was easily filtered even after moderate mixing, resulting in a bubble-free, optically clear polymer. Viscosity Measurements The viscosities of the resulting buffer solutions were measured with the appropriately sized Cannon-Fenske viscometer tube from Ace Glass. Viscometer sizes used ranged from 25 to 300. Measurements of select solutions were performed in triplicate at both 20ยฐ C. and 37ยฐ C. The results are shown in Table 8B. To calculate the approximate dynamic viscosities, it was assumed that all the buffer solutions had the same density as water. To characterize the rheology of the polymers during the gelation process, a size 300 viscometer was used with a formulation that was designed to gel after approximately 15 minutes. The formulation used involved the 8ARM-20k-NH2 with the 4ARM-20k-SGA ester at 2.5% solution and 0.3% HPMC. The reaction occurred in a 0.05 M phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.2. Thus, one viscosity measurement with the size 300 viscometer was obtained in about one minute and subsequent measurements may be obtained in quick succession up to the gel point. Hydrogel Surface Spread Test Since the surface of the retina is extremely hydrophilic, making it likely that a liquid drop will spread beyond the desired site of administration, the spread was modeled using an extremely hydrophilic surface. To model the performance of the polymer solutions on a hydrophilic surface the extent of spreading and dripping of droplets on a high water content hydrogel surface at an incline of about 30ยฐ was recorded. The hydrogel was made by dissolving 0.10 g (0.04 mol arm eq.) of 8ARM-20k-NH2 in 7 mL 0.05 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 in a Petri-dish, followed by the addition of 0.075 g (0.04 mol arm eq.) of 8ARM-15k-SG ester. The solution was stirred with a spatula for 10 to 20 seconds and allowed to gel, which typically took 5 to 10 minutes. The water content of the resulting polymer was 97.5%. The test was performed by first preparing the polymer solution in the usual fashion. After thorough mixing, the polymer solution was dispensed dropwise through a 22 gauge needle onto the hydrogel surface. The results are shown in Table 8B and were divided into three general categories: 1) no spreading, tight drops that stay in place; 2) mild spreading, drops drip slowly down; 3) severe spreading, drops completely wet surface. Water is in category 3. Swelling Measurements The extent of swelling in the polymers during the degradation process was quantified as the liquid uptake of the polymers. A known mass of the polymer was placed in PBS at 37ยฐ C. At specified time intervals, the polymer was isolated from the buffer solution, patted dry with paper towels and weighed. The percent increase in the mass was calculated from the initial mass. The percent of water uptake by the 8ARM-20k-NH2/4ARM-20k-SGA polymers with 0, 0.3 and 1.0% HPMC is shown in FIG. 13. The 1.0% HPMC polymer absorbed up to 30% of its weight in water until day 20. After day 20, the polymer returned to about 10% of its weight in water. In comparison, the 0% HPMC polymer initially absorbed up to 10% of its weight in water, but began to lose water gradually, hovering about 5% of its weight in water. The 0.3% HPMC polymer behaved in an intermediate fashion. It initially absorbed up to 20% of its weight in water, but returned to about 10% of its weight in water after a week and continued to slowly lose water. Specific Gravity Measurements The specific gravity of the polymers was obtained by preparing the polymer solution in the usual fashion and pipetting 1.00 mL of the thoroughly mixed solution onto an analytical balance. The measurements were performed in triplicate at 20ยฐ C. The specific gravity was calculated by using the density of water at 4ยฐ C. as the reference. The obtained values for the specific gravity are shown in FIG. 14. The specific gravity of the polymers did not differ significantly from that of the buffer solution only, both of which were essentially the same as the specific gravity of water. Exceptions may occur when the polymer solution is not filtered and air bubbles become embedded in the polymer matrix. Barium Sulfate Suspensions For imaging purposes, barium sulfate was added to several polymer formulations as a radiocontrast agent. Barium sulfate concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0% (w/v) were explored. The viscosity of the resulting polymer solutions was measured and the effect of barium sulfate addition on the polymer gel times and syringability characteristics were also studied. Barium sulfate concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0% (w/v) were explored. The opaque, milky white suspensions formed similarly opaque and white polymers. No changes in the gel times were observed. Qualitatively, the polymers appeared to have similar properties to that of polymers without barium sulfate. All formulations were able to be readily dispensed through a 22 gauge needle. The results of the viscosity measurements for barium sulfate concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0% are shown in FIG. 15. The viscosity remained relatively stable up to 2.0%; at 5.0%, the viscosity increased slightly to about 2.5 cP. There was a sharp increase in the viscosity to nearly 10 cP as the concentration approached 10.0%. Thus, a barium sulfate concentration of 5.0% was chosen as a balance between high contrast strength and similarity to unmodified polymer formulations. Hydrogel Firmness, Elastic Modulus, and Adhesion The firmness of the polymers was characterized by a Texture Analyzer model TA.XT.plus with Exponent software version 6.0.6.0. The method followed the industry standard โBloom Testโ for measuring the firmness of gelatins. In this test, the TA-8 ยผโณ ball probe was used to penetrate the polymer sample to a defined depth and then return out of the sample to the original position. The peak force measured is defined as the โfirmnessโ of the sample. For the polymers studied, a test speed of 0.50 mm/sec, a penetration depth of 4 mm, and a trigger force of 5.0 g were used. The polymers were prepared on a 2.5 mL scale directly in a 5 mL size vial to ensure consistent sample dimensions. The vials used were ThermoScientific/Nalgene LDPE sample vials, product#6250-0005 (LOT#7163281060). Measurements were conducted at 20ยฐ C. The polymers were allowed to rest at room temperature for approximately 1 hour before measuring. Measurements were performed in triplicate for at least three samples. A sample plot generated by the Exponent software running the firmness test is given in FIG. 16. The peak of the plot represents the point at which the target penetration depth of 4 mm was reached. The elastic modulus of the polymers was characterized by a Texture Analyzer model TA.XT.plus with Exponent software version 6.0.6.0. In this test, the TA-19 Kobe probe was used to compress a polymer cylinder of known dimensions until fracture of the polymer occurs. The probe has a defined surface area of 1 cm2. The modulus was calculated as the initial slope up to 10% of the maximum compression stress. For the polymers studied, a test speed of 5.0 mm/min and a trigger force of 5.0 g were used. The sample height was auto-detected by the probe. The polymers were prepared on a 2.5 mL scale directly in a 5 mL size vial cap to ensure consistent sample dimensions. The vials used were ThermoScientific/Nalgene LDPE sample vials, product#6250-0005 (LOT#7163281060). Measurements were conducted at 20ยฐ C. The polymers were allowed to rest at room temperature for approximately 1 hour before measuring. Measurements were performed for at least three samples. A sample plot generated by the Exponent software running the modulus test is given in FIG. 17. The polymers typically behaved elastically for the initial compression, as evidenced by the nearly linear plot. The adhesive properties of the polymers were characterized by a Texture Analyzer model TA.XT.plus with Exponent software version 6.0.6.0. In the adhesive test, the TA-57R 7 mm diameter punch probe was used to contact the polymer sample with a defined force for a certain amount of time, and then return out of the sample to the original position. An exemplary plot generated by the Exponent software running the adhesive test is given in FIG. 18. The plot begins when the probe hits the surface of the polymer. The target force is applied on the sample for a defined unit of time, represented by the constant force region in the plot. Then, the probe returns out of the sample to the original position and the adhesive force between the probe and the sample is measured as the โtackโ, which is the peak force required to remove the probe from the sample. Other properties that were measured include the adhesion energy or the work of adhesion, and the material's โstringiness.โ The adhesion energy is simply the area under the curve representing the tack force. Thus, a sample with a high tack and low adhesion energy will qualitatively feel very sticky, but may be cleanly removed with a quick pull; a sample with a high tack and high adhesion energy will also feel very sticky, but the removal of the material will be more difficult and may be accompanied by stretching of the polymer, fibril formation and adhesive residues. The elasticity of the polymer is proportional to the measured โstringinessโ, which is the distance the polymer stretches while adhered to the probe before failure of the adhesive bond. For the polymers studied, a test speed of 0.50 mm/sec, a trigger force of 2.0 g, and a contact force of 100.0 g and contact time of 10.0 sec were used. The polymers were prepared on a 1.0 to 2.5 mL scale directly in a 5 mL size vial to ensure consistent sample surfaces. The vials used were ThermoScientific/Nalgene LDPE sample vials. Measurements were conducted at 20ยฐ C. The polymers were allowed to rest at room temperature for approximately 1 hour before measuring. As reference materials, the adhesive properties of a standard Post-It Noteยฎ and Scotch Tapeยฎ were measured. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The averages and standard deviations were calculated. The effect of HPMC addition to the mechanical properties of the polymers was explored, along with the effect of adding degradable 8ARM-20k-AA amine. The results are shown in FIGS. 19A, 19B, 20A, and 20B. Under the stated conditions of the firmness test, it was found that the addition of 0.3% HPMC decreased the firmness of the polymer by about half (FIG. 19A). This corresponds to a slight decrease in the elastic modulus (FIG. 20A). The 1.0% HPMC polymer had approximately the same firmness as the 0.3% HPMC polymer, but a slight decrease in the elastic modulus. The disparity between the firmness and modulus tests is likely due to experimental error. The polymer solutions were not filtered, so the presence of air bubbles likely increased the errors. The water content of the polymers may also change as the polymers were sitting in the air, essentially changing the physical properties of the materials. It was found that the addition of the degradable 8ARM-20k-AA amine did not substantially change the measured values of the firmness or the elastic modulus (FIG. 19B and FIG. 20B). The results of the adhesion testing are shown in FIGS. 21A, 21B, 21C, and 21D. The measured values for a standard commercial Post-Itโข Note are also included as a reference. The polymer tack was found to be around 40 mN, which is about three times less than that of a Post-Itโข Note. The adhesive properties of the polymer were not found to vary with the addition of the degradable amine. FIG. 22 shows the firmness vs. degradation time for the 8ARM-20k-AA/8ARM-20k-NH2 (70/30) & 4ARM-20k-SGA at 4.8% solution with 0.3% HPMC. The error bars represent the standard deviations of 3 samples. The degradation time for the polymer was 18 days. The firmness of the polymer strongly correlated with the extent of degradation. Swelling may also play a role during the early stages. Optical Clarify A Thermo Scientific GENESYS 10S UV-Vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical clarity of the viscous solutions. To a quartz cuvette, 1.5 mL of the sample solution was pipetted. The buffer solution with no additives was used as the reference. The stable % transmission of the sample was recorded at 650 nm and the results are listed in Table 8C. All of the viscous solutions under consideration were found to have acceptable to excellent optical clarity under the concentration ranges used (greater than 97% transmission). For the highly viscous solutions, air bubble formation during mixing was observed, which may be resolved by the addition of an anti-foaming agent, or through the use of a syringe filter. Example 12 General Procedure for the Preparation of In Vivo Polymerizable Thin Films Several representative formulations for both sticky and non-sticky films are listed in Table 9 along with specific reaction details. The films had thicknesses ranging from 100 to 500 ฮผm, and may be layered with different formulations in a composite film.

The materials used to assemble the kits are listed in Table 10 and the formulations used are listed in Table 11. The kits are typically composed of two syringes, one syringe containing the solid components and the other syringe containing the liquid buffer. The syringes are connected via a mixing tube and a one-way valve. The contents of the syringes are mixed via opening the valve and transferring the contents of one syringe into the other, repeatedly, for 10 to 20 seconds. The spent syringe and mixing tube are then removed and discarded, and the active syringe is fitted with a dispensing unit, such as a needle or cannula, and the polymer solution is expelled until the onset of gelation. In other embodiments, the viscous solution impedes the dissolution of the solid components and thus a third syringe is employed. The third syringe contains a concentrated viscous buffer that enhances the viscosity of the solution once all the components have dissolved. In some embodiments, the optical clarity of the resulting polymer is improved through the addition of a syringe filter. All of the formulations tested were easily dispensed through a 22 gauge needle. The mixing action between the two syringes was turbulent and the introduction of a significant amount of air bubbles was apparent. Gentle mixing results in a clear material free of bubbles. Alternatively, the use of a syringe filter was found to remove bubbles without any change in the polymer properties.

The materials used to assemble the kits are listed in Table 12. The kits are typically composed of two syringes, one syringe containing the solid components and the other syringe containing the liquid buffer. The syringes were loaded by removing the plungers, adding the components, purging the syringe with a gentle flow of nitrogen gas for 20 seconds, and then replacing the plunger. Finally, the plungers were depressed as much as possible to reduce the internal volume of the syringes. The specifications for the amounts of chemical components in the kits are listed in Table 13A. A summary describing the lots of kits prepared is listed in Table 13B. The syringes were connected directly after uncapping, the male part locking into the female part (FIGS. 23A and 23B). The contents of the syringes were mixed via transferring the contents of one syringe into the other, repeatedly, for 10 to 20 seconds. The spent syringe was then removed and discarded, and the active syringe was fitted with a dispensing unit, such as a needle or cannula, and the polymer solution was expelled until the onset of gelation. In other embodiments, the viscous solution impeded the dissolution of the solid components and thus a third syringe was employed. The third syringe contained a concentrated viscous buffer that enhanced the viscosity of the solution once all the components had dissolved. All the formulations tested were easily dispensed through a 22 gauge needle. The mixing action between the two syringes was turbulent and the introduction of a significant amount of air bubbles was apparent. The use of a syringe filter was found to remove bubbles without any change in the polymer properties. The prepared kits were placed into foil pouches along with one oxygen absorbing packet per pouch. The pouches were heat sealed with a CHTC-280 PROMAX tabletop chamber sealing unit. Two different modes of sealing were explored: under nitrogen and under vacuum. The settings for sealing under nitrogen were: 30 seconds of vacuum, 20 seconds of nitrogen, 1.5 seconds of heat sealing, and 3.0 seconds of cooling. The settings for sealing under vacuum were: 60 seconds of vacuum, 0 seconds of nitrogen, 1.5 seconds of heat sealing, and 3.0 seconds of cooling.

A 0.15 M phosphate buffer was made by dissolving 9.00 g (0.075 mol) NaH2PO4 in 500 mL of distilled water at 25ยฐ C. with magnetic stirring. The pH was then adjusted to 7.99 with the dropwise addition of 50% aqueous NaOH. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was prepared by dissolving two PBS tablets (Sigma Chemical, P4417) in 400 mL of distilled water at 25ยฐ C. with vigorous shaking. The solution has the following composition and pH: 0.01 M phosphate, 0.0027 M potassium chloride, 0.137 M sodium chloride, pH 7.46. TABLE 14 Components of Formulations Tested in Harvested Pig Eyes.

The kits are composed of two syringes, one syringe containing the solid components and the other syringe containing the liquids. The syringes are connected via a mixing tube and a one-way valve. The contents of the syringe are mixed after opening the valve and transferring the contents of one syringe into the other, repeatedly, for 10 to 20 seconds. The spent syringe and mixing tube are then removed and discarded, and the active syringe is fitted with a needle, and the polymer solution is injected into the desired site while still in the liquid state. The liquid polymer turns in to a solid at a pre-set time at the desired site and sticks to the tissue. The optical clarity of the resulting polymer is improved by removing the air bubbles through the addition of a syringe filter. Retinal Tissue Tests Pig eyes were obtained and stored appropriately. Surgery was carried out carefully and the vitreous humor was separated from the retina and then the retina was cut at several places and then pinned appropriately to a Styrofoam base to create basically a flat retinal surface. The liquid suture formulations of Table 14 were mixed per the mixing procedure above and carefully deposited drop by drop over the retinal surface. Any spreading of the drop from the location was carefully observed and recorded. After test samples gelled in about 60-120 seconds, the bond strength of the adhesion was evaluated. All three formulations were applied the same way. The results are summarized in Table 15. TABLE 15 Test Results for Formulations A-C on Retinal Tissue. Formulation Results/Observations A It is a sticky material, gelled in 110 seconds. Not deemed โhardโ enough. The material showed bubbles and it spread all over; not localized B It is a sticky material, gelled in 120 seconds. Not deemed โhardโ enough. The material showed bubbles and it spread all over; not localized. C It is a less sticky material, gelled in 80 seconds. Bonding was satisfactory. Formulation bonded to retina uniformly and showed no delamination area under the microscope. The material showed bubbles and was also not localized only at the target site. Bubbles in the polymer lowered the optical clarity at the location. It also passed the blue dye leak test indicating that the bonding was strong and leak free. Of the 3 formulation types tested, formulation โCโ was most successful even though all 3 formulations provide satisfactory results. In order to improve the clarity and control the polymer spread, bubble formation and drop spread were evaluated. In order to avoid bubble formation, the mixing procedure was altered, wider diameter mixing tubes were used, the syringe size was changed, antifoaming agents were added, organic solvents such as DMSO were added to the formulation, or filters were used. After examining all options, the use of 5 microns filter was deemed to be the most effective and practical procedure. The bubble formation was eliminated by using a 5 micron filter during the injection process. 0.2 Micron filter also was acceptable except for higher viscosity materials which clogged the filter. In some instances, a higher viscosity material does not spread as fast as the lower viscosity material. Therefore, several viscosity enhancing agents were formulated with the initial formulations as shown in Table 16. The initial results for viscosity are included in Table 11. Optical clarity data is included in Table 8. TABLE 16 Viscosity Enhanced Formulations A-C Arms % Formulation Components MW wt.

After a 3-port pars plana vitrectomy (after cataract extraction by phaco) using a 23 gauge transconjunctival technique, a retinal tear or hole was created. The in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation was delivered through a 23 gauge intraocular cannula after an air/fluid exchange to create a retinal patch over the retinal lesion. It was verified that the polymer covered the retinal tear area and created a patch on the damaged retina. After about 1 minute the liquid became sold and adhered to the pathologic area of the retina. A stained liquid (trypan blue) was injected in the sub-retinal space to assess the resistance of the patch. The optical clarity met expectation. Example 15 Retinal Patch in Live Animals (Rabbits) This study is designed to select the best polymer in terms of adherence, stickiness, thickness, and transparency; to improve the design of the delivery system and technique; assess the efficacy of the retinal patch in keeping the retinal patch attached; and to assess the safety of the polymer in terms of inflammatory reactions or other toxic effects on the retina. 40 Rabbits are used in the study, wherein 40 eyes are subject to treatment while the fellow eye is used as the control eye. After a 3-port pars plana vitrectomy (after cataract extraction by phaco), a retain tear or hole is created. The in vivo gelling ophthalmic pre-formulation is delivered to create a retinal patch over the retinal lesion in 20 rabbits, while the entire vitreous cavity is filled with the polymer in the other 20 rabbits. The eyes are evaluated for intraocular inflammation at day 1, 7, 15, and 30 by slit lamp evaluation, fundus evaluation, and intraocular pressure measurements. The eyes are evaluated for retinal toxicity at day 1, 7, 15, and 30 by anatomopathologic evaluation of the retina (which has or has not been in contact with the patch), multifocal ERG and +/โDNA analysis. Example 16 Method of Treating Retinal Tear Using Local Anesthesia This study is designed to treat a retinal tear using local anesthesia. The site of the hole, tear, or retinal detachment is identified using the existing and well established techniques. Once the hole/tear/detachment location is identified, the kits are prepared according to Example 13. Using a sharp 24 to 28 gauge needle, about 10-500 micro liters of the polymers is injected around and over the hole making sure that the entire surface area is fully covered with the polymer mixture. The viscosity of the reacting mixture does not allow excessive flow of the fluid past the site of the injection. Every attempt is made to keep the polymer injection near the hole, tear, or detachment sites by keeping the subject in a stable position. Even if a small amount flows over in another area, it will dissolve and disappear in about 14-17 days. After the tear is covered, the polymer solidifies in less than 3 minutes from the time the mixing was started. The polymer will stay at the site for 14-17 days and then dissolve and disappear. Example 17 Clinical Trial for the Treatment of Retinal Detachment with a Hydrogel Formulation after Surgery The aim of the study is to evaluate the influence of exemplary hydrogel formulation C on thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer by using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients following pars plana vitrectomy. The study will include 60 patients with a Formulation C provided herein who will be surgically treated with pars plana vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. All subjects will be subdued to complete ophthalmologic examinations, measurements of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness by an OCT examination, tests of the visual field with the use of an Octopus computed perimeter (automated static perimetry) and FDT-perimetryโboth prior to the surgery, and on control visits for check-up during the postoperative period. All results provided by postoperative examinations will be compared with one another. The study is expected to provide data on the effect of an exemplary Formulation C on thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer. It is also planned to show possibilities and advantages of OCT as a method of choice in the follow-up of patients with an intraocular Formulation C.
