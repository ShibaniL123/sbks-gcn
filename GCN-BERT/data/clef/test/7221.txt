APPLICATOR FOR SEMI-SOLID MATERIALS Cross-Refcrenec to Related Applications This application claims the benefit of U S Provisional Applications 61/997,006 filed May 20, 2014 and 62/125,769 filed February 2, 2015, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. Background and Summary of the Invention The invention relates to an applicator for semi-solid materials, sometimes called "stick products," including but not limited to lip balm (such as shown in U S Patent 7,695,727 and the prior art discussed therein), sunscreen, skin balm, analgesic balm, lipstick, deodorant, and make- up. The applicator according to the invention Is simple and easy to use, simple and inexpensive to manufacture, versatile, and aesthetic. The applicator is also easily refiilable and therefore more environmentally sound than other tangentially related products such as shown in U S Patents 5,799,667, 6,193,427, and S,444,337, and is expected to have a long shelf life. The applicator is also easy to use to effectively apply stick products to a human's body, including lips, underarms, or other portions of skin. According to one aspect of the invention, a stick product semi-solid material applicator is provided which comprises: A generally tubular housing having first and second open ends. An elastomeric material base cap closing the housing first end. A plunger having first and second ends, the plunger first end operatively connected to the flexible material cap. A mass of semi- solid material stick product mounted on the second end of the plunger. And, at least one readily removable end cap covering the housing second end. The end cap is movable from a first position in which it covers the semi-solid material to preclude access thereto, and a second position in which the semi-solid material can extend at least partially out the housing second end. The elastomeric materia! base cap may he concave in relaxed position so as to bias the semi-solid material to the second position extending at least partially out of the second end of the housing. Preferably, however, the elastomeric material base cap is a bistable element which moves from a first stable configuration in which the semi-solid material is primarily within the housing to, after removal of the end cap and manual actuation thereof, a second stable configuration in which the semi-solid mass is substantially completely exterior of the housing. The base cap may be of ureihane or a similar thermoplastic material, and desirably has a du ometer of about 40-90 (e. g. about 70) on the Shore A scale. The applicator also desirably includes at least one stop in the interior of the housing between the first and second ends thereof for stopping the movement of the plunger at a desired position. Also, the at least one end cap preferably comprises a mold for the semi-solid material to allow in situ molding thereof on the plunger. Compatible projections are provided on the housing adjacent the second end thereof, and on the end cap, to provide releasable locking connection of the end cap to the housing. Desirably, the plunger comprises a shaft and a tray which holds the semi-solid material, the tray having a peripheral section devoid of semi-solid material; and wherein the end cap can engage the peripheral section to move the semi-solid materia! from the second position to the first position thereof without adversely affecting the semi-solid material. The plunger also may comprise a disc (integral with or detached from the shaft) adjacent the second end of the shaft which cooperates with the tray to irnnimlze contact of the semi-solid material with air inside the housing. The plunger shaft and tray may have cooperating surface manifestations to allow releasable connection of one to the other,, or may be integral. The plunger also has a knob and recess at the first end thereof which cooperates with surface manifestations on the elastomeric material base cap to allow ready replacement of the plunger and semi-solid material mass. Preferably, a guide is provided mounted within the housing between the first and second ends thereof which guides reciprocal movement of the plunger . The guide cooperates with vertical ribs on the plunger that define a diameter or other cross-sectional dimension that is the same as, or sli ghtly greater than, the diameter or other cross-sectional dimension of the plunger knob, The generally tubular housing can have a wide variety of different shapes including a uniform diameter circle in cross-section, a uniform or tapered polygon (e. g. hexagon) in cross- section, or it may have tapering side walls at least one of which is substantially flat. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of assembling an applicator unit with a semi-solid stick product, the applicator unit including a plunger shaft, a plunger tray having openings and surface manifestations (such as tabs) therein, and an end cap having an open top and a bottom in the form of a mold. The method is characterized by: a) Placing the tray on the open top of the end cap. b) Filling the bottom of the end cap with flowable stick product so that it passes through the openings in the plunger tray and engages the surface manifestations, c) Allowing the flowable stick product to cool or otherwise set into a semi-solid mass attached to the plunger tray but not attached to the end cap bottom. And d) ensuring that the plunger shaft is in operative association with fee plunger tray so that the tray and semi -solid mass move with the plunger shaft. The method is desirably for use with a generally tubular applicator housing having a bistable elastomeric material base cap, and is further characterized by: e) Moving an end of the plunger shaft opposite the tray into contact with the elastomeric material base cap so that they are releasably connected together, f) Pushing the end cap into operative association with surface manifestations on the end of the housing opposite the base cap so that they releasable lock together. And g) removing the end cap and acting on the bistable base cap so that the base cap biases the semi-solid mass of stick product out of the housing for use on a user's body. According to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided an applicator, comprising: A bistable body of elastomeric material having a peripheral portion with inner and outer surfaces, and a center portion with top and bottom surfaces, the center portion top surface having a convex shape in a first relaxed configuration, and a concave shape in a second relaxed configuration, and the center portion bottom surface having a depending center tubular element. Surface manifestations in the interior of the center tubular element for cooperation with a knob and recess of a plunger. And surface manifestations on the inner surface of the peripheral portion for cooperation with a housing for an applicator. The cap is desirably made of a thermoplastic material with properties comparable to those of urethane and has a durometer of between about 40-90 (e. g. about 70) on the Shore A scale. it is the primary obj ct of the present invention to provide a particularly desirable applicator for stick products, such as lip balm, a novel base cap for the applicator, and a method of assembly and utilization of the applicator. This and other objects of the invention will become clear from a detailed description of the drawings, r d from the appended claims.

Detailed Description of the Drawings, FIGURE. 1 shows an exemplary applicator 10 according to the invention, approximately to scale for a preferred size, in a human user's hand with the end cap 11 removed and the elastorneric material base cap 12 depressed so that the mass of semi-solid material stick product (such as lip balm) 13 (which preferably has the generally conical shape illustrated) is available to be applied to the human user's body, or some other object. The main body 14 of the applicator 10 is preferably molded of polypropylene (PP) or a similar plastic. The end cap 11 in this embodiment is two-part, including an outer textured cap 15 desirably made of PP or a similar plastic, and an inner cap 16 made of high density polyethylene (HOPE) or a similar plastic. The elastomeric material forming the base cap 12 may be any suitable, thermoplastic elastomeric material (such as silicone rubber, natural rubber, urethane or polyurethane) and may have a Shore A Scale hardness of between about 40-90, as long as the cap 12 acts like a spring and returns the mass of semi-solid material 13 to a position primarily within the main body 14 when the user's ringer pressure depressing the cap 12 is terminated, FIGURE 2 is a side cross-sectional view (all other side cross-sectional views would be substantially the same) of the applicator 10 (to a different scale) with the end cap 11 in place, and with the semi -solid mass 13 shown in elevation, FIGURE 3 is a cross-sectional view taken along lines 3-3 of FIGURE. 2 while FIGURE 4 is art exploded cross-sectional view (with the mass of semi -solid material, e, g. lip balm, 13 shown in elevation) of the applicator 10 of FIGURES 1-3. The element 14 defines a generally tubular housing. While the housing may have a substantially constant diameter circular cross-section, as illustrated in FIGURES 1-4, it may have a wide variety of other shapes. For example it may have a polygonal shape (e, g. hexagon) with constant or tapering cross-sectional dimension,, or it may have tapering side walls at least one of which provides a substantially flat surface (e, g. for attachment of a label or in moid labelling). The mass of semi-solid material 13 may be formed in situ in the applicator 10 before final assembly thereof, or may be formed exteriorly of the applicator unit 10 and then inserted after formation, in either event in a preferred embodiment the semi-solid material 13 is heated or otherwise acted upon to become flowable, arid then put into a mold with the movable plunger 20 positioned adjacent the mold. If the mass 13 is formed in situ then the inner end cap 16, winch defines an interior conical cavity i 7 (see FIG. 4), serves as the mold. In circumstances where it is desirable that the mass have a shape different than a cone (e. g, a rectangular parallelepiped or half-sphere) the cavity 17 will have a corresponding shape. If desired, the outer end cap 15 has a. recess 18 in the bottom thereof (see FIGURES 1 and 4) which facilitates standing of the outer end cap 1 i on a flat surface when not covering the mass .13. As seen in FIGURE 4, the movable (e. g. reciprocal) plunger 20, which may be made of HDPE, PP, or a similar plastic, includes a shaft 21 having an upper protuberance 22. and a base or tray 23. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGURE 43 the base/tray 23 comprises a disc-shaped bottom 24 with an upstanding peripheral side wall 25. The disc-shaped bottom 24 has one or more (e. g. three) openings 26 therein. Whether formed in situ or externally of the unit 10, the semi-solid mass 13 ultimately has portions thereof on both the top and bottom of the disc 24 (extending through the openings 26), within the volume defined by the side wall 25s and surrounding the shaft 21 at the bottom thereof. As seen in FIGURE 4? the base cap 12 of the embodiment illustrated therein has a dome shape, preferably with a flattened upper center portion 30 which facilitates positioning of the index linger of the human user wh operating the applicator 10. interiorly of the dome shape of the base cap 12 is a central tube 31 into which the plunger 20 protuberance/knob 22 extends. The interior of tube 31 preferably contains a ring 32 of material extending in wardly and defining a center portion of the interior of tube 31 that has a diameter (or other eross-sectional dimension) less than that of the protuberance 22. With this eonfig oration, once the cap 12 is pushed down over the protuberance 22, the engagement between the protuberance 22 and the ring 32 causes the material of tube 31 to flex outwardly until the protuberance 22 snaps into place above the ring 32 within the tube 31 , This cooperation between components holds the elements 12, 20 together during normal use. However, should the user desire to replace the plunger 20 and semisolid mass 13 at some point, the cap 12 and plunger 20 can be detached from each other by pulling hard on the plunger 20 while holding the cap 12 steady, The base cap 12 can also have an interior outer ring 33 which cooperates with the top of the main body 14 to hold the base cap 12 in place on the housirsg 14 at the outer circumference of the base cap 12s while still allowing depression of the base cap 12 at the central flat portion 30 thereof. As earlier indicated, the main housing 14 in the FIGURES 1-4 embodiment is generally tubular, but may be provided with flattened side portions 35, and with a tapered portion 36 below a top rim 37. The portions 35, 36 facilitate gripping of the unit 10 by the human user, in turn enabling easy utilization of the unit 10 to apply lip balm, or other semi-solid material 13, to parts of die user's body, or other surfaces. Interiorly of the housing 14, as seen In FIGURE 4, is a center guide structure. The guide structure is preferably molded, of the same material as the body 14 and integral therewith. In the preferred embodiment illustrated structure includes a hollow central huh 39 through which the shaft 21 extends. The hub 39 is supported by a plurality (e. g. four) of struts 40. The hub 39 prevents the shaft 21 from deflecting too much in any direction as it is reciprocated when the base cap 12 is depressed, Also formed interiorly of the housing 14 are a plurality (e. g. four) of stops 41 which optionally may allow the base 23 of the plunger 20 to be inserted from the top into the housing 14, but which engage the peripheral side wall 25 of the plunger 20 to prevent undesired upward movement of the shaft 21. Each stop 41 (very sehemaiicaliy illustrated in FIGURES 2-6) can be integrally molded with housing 34 positioned in alignment with a strut 40, The top 42 of each stop 41 may have an inward slope which can, under some circumstances although the components would not normally be assembled that way, allow the base 24 of plunger 20 to move past the stops 41, hut a horizontal bottom 43 which engages the top of the side wall 25 to prevent upward movement past the stops 41 (see FIGURE 4). The inner bottom cap 16 may be fixed to the outer bottom cap 15 either permanently, or releasabiy. For example an adhesive (not shown) may be placed between the surfaces 47, 4S (see FIGUE 4) of the caps 15, 1 6, respectively, to hold mem together, or they may be plastic (e. g. ultrasonically) welded together. Alternatively, there may he a conventional twist or rib lock (such as generally shown in U S Patent 4,279,355) between the surfaces 47, 48. The outer bottom cap 15 also has a releasable connection to the bottom of the housing 14. This releasable connection, between the surfaces 49, 50 of the elements 15, 14, respectively, schematically illustrated in FIGURE 4S may also comprise a conventional twist or rib lock (e. g. as in USP 4,279,355), or any other suitable conventional releasable interconnection. In one exemplary manner of assembly of the components of the applicator 1.0, the semisolid mass 13 is formed in situ. In this scenario the plunger 20 is inserted into the housing 14 through the open bottom of housing 14. The protuberance 22 and shaft 21 are passed through the center opening in the hub 39, which opening is just large enough to accommodate the protuberance 22, but small enough so that it prevents too much lateral movement of the shaft.21 during reciprocation thereof. The plunger 20 is inserted until the top of side wall 25 thereof engages the bottoms 43 of stops 41. in the next assembly step the lower cap 11 is releasabiy connected to the housing 14, such as by the twist locks provided by the surfaces 49, 50 between the outer bottom cap 15 and the bottom of the housing 14, as described above with respect to FIGURE 4. in this way the conical interior opening 17 of the inner lower cap 16 is in place to serve as a moid. In the next assembly step the semi-solid material (e.g. iip bairn) in hot liquid or other fiowable form is poured into the main body 14 through the open top thereof. The liquid flows through the open ngs 26 in the disc-shaped bottom 24 of the base 23 of plunger 20 and hits the inner conical form 17 of the inner bottom cap 16, which acts as a mold. Liquid is poured into the body 14 until its level is past the top of the disc-shaped bottom 24, but below the top of the peripheral sidewal! 25. When the hot liquid cools, or the otherwise fiowable material sets, the conical semi-solid mass 13 is formed, held securely to the plunger 20. In the final assembly step, the base cap 12 is placed onto the top of the housing 14, assuming the position illustrated in FIGURE 2. In that position the bottom lip-ring 33 of the cap 12 (FIGURE 2) extends into the open area 51 (FIGURE 4) at the top inner periphery of the rim 37 of housing 14 and may lock with the projection 52. Alternatively, the cap 12 could be substantially permanently attached to the body 1.4, such as by plastic welding or by an adhesive. A human uses the applicator unit 10 by removing the bottom cap 1 1, such as by twisting it one-q'uarier turn to release a conventional twist lock between surfaces 49, 50. Then the base cap 12 is depressed by the user's index linger, as seen in FIGURE 1, to reciprocate the plunger 20 and move the semi-solid mass (e. g. lip balm) 13 almost completely out of the /housing 14. While the mass 13 is in the position Illustrated in FIGURE 2 it can be applied to a part, of the user's body (e. g. her his lips if it: is lip balm), or some oilier surface, depending upon the composition and intended use of the mass 13, When application is completed, the user simply pulls her his finger out of engagement with the base cap 12, and the elastameric material of cap 12 causes the plunger 20 to spring upwardly (until the top of side wall 25 engages the bottoms 43 of the stops 41) so that the mass 13 is almost completely within the housing 14 and so that the lower cap 11 may be re-connected to the housing 14. When the semi-solid material mass 13 has been used up, or another type of semi-solid material is desired to be applied using the applicator 10, it is easily replaced. This can he accomplished in a number of different ways, two of which will be described. In tl e first manner of replacing the mass 13, the lower cap 1 1 is removed. The user then completely depresses the base cap 12 so that the connection between the protuberance 22 and the ring 32 is as weak as possible. Then the user grabs the side wall 25, or the remaining portion of S the mass 13. with her or his fmgers, or preferably with a tongs (not shown) or other tool designed for that purpose, and pulls downwardly on. the plunger 20. This moves the protuberance 22 out of the inner tube 31 of cap 12, and allows continued extraction of the plunger 20 through the center opening in hub 39 and then out of the open bottom of the housing 14. A new plunger 20s with new semi-solid mass 13 (as those components are illustrated in FIGURE 2), which has been made exteriorly of unit 10 using an exterior mold similar to the mold 16, 17, Is then inserted through the open bottom of the housing 14. This insertion is accomplished so that the protuberance 22 on th e shaft 21 of the new plunger 20 passes through the central opening in hub 39 and then into the inner tube 31 of the base cap 12 until there is a snap fit between the protuberance 22 and inner ring 32, The. insertion may also be facilitated by using a tongs or other tool specifically designed for that purpose. The material 13 may be covered with a paper or plastic covering until the insertion process is completed, which paper or plastic covering Is then easily removed. In a second manner of replacing the mass 13, with the lower cap 11 in place the user grips the peripheral edge of the base cap 12 with her/his fingers and lifts up while holding the housing 14 steady. This detaches the protuberance 22 from the cap 12 and moves ring 33 past projection 52 (FIGURE 4), Then the user detaches the lower cap 11 (e. g. by a one-quarter twist to release the locking surfaces 49, 50) and removes the existing plunger 20 and any remaining mass 13 thereon, in the same manner as described for the first maimer (e. g. with tongs). The new plunger 20 and mass 13 are then inserted also as described for the first maimer. If desired a new inner end cap 16 may also be provided for the plunger 20 and mass 13. In that case the old inner lower cap 16 is detached (e. g. by twisting) from the existing outer lower cap IS, and the new end cap element 16 connected to the existing end cap element 15. Reconnection of the base cap 12 to the new plunger shaft.21 / rotuberance 22, is accomplished just as in the first manner, FIGURES 5 & 6 show another embodiment of an applicator according to the invention The primary difference between the invention illustrated in FIGURES 5 & 6 and what is illustrated in FIGURES 1-4 is the construction of the elasiomerie material base cap !2\ The base cap 12' is molded with a concave configuration as illustrated in FIGURE 6. That way, when the end cap 11 is removed, the semi-solid material (e, g. lip balm) 13 is biased out from the bousing 14 by a spring action of the naturally concave cap 12'. This construction of the base cap 12* also provides a cushioning (or shock-absorbing) effect of the spring like action when applying the lip balm, or other semi-solid material 13, to a user's body. To move the material 13 to the non-use position of FIGURE 5 the outer textured end cap 15 of the end cap 1 1 is pushed upwardly as indicated by arrow A in FIGURE 5 to bring the inner portion 16 of cap 11 into contact with the bottom of the housing 14. The inner portion hits a peripheral portion 245 of the bottom of tray 23 so that it. preferably does not directly engage the material 13. The end cap inner portion 16 is then screwed (e. g. just ½ turn) onto the main body 14 so thai the cap 11 holds the material 13 In the position illustrated in FIGURE 55 pushing the elastomeric material base cap 12' upwardly to a stressed convex position, as illustrated in FIGURE 5. In the FIGURES 5 & 6 embodiment the shaft 21 of the plunger 20 will be longer than in the FIGURES 1-4 embodiment and sturdier (e. g, larger diameter), but otherwise the other components are basically the same, FIGURES 7-1 1 illustrate a preferred embodiment of applicator according to the invention!, utilizing an enhanced form of the base cap 12, 12', In the FIGURES 7-11 embodiment components comparable to those in the FIGURES 1 -4 embodiment are shown by the same reference numeral only preceded by a "1 ," The stick product semi-solid material applicator 110 of the FIGURES 7-1 1 embodiment comprises a generally tubular housing 114 having first and second open ends 60, 61, respectively. An elastomeric material base cap 1 12 closes the housing first end 60; the base cap 112, per se, according to this embodiment also may be utilized with other structures, The base cap 112, illustrated in three different positions in FIGURES 7-105 is desirably of a thermoplastic material having properties comparable to those of urethane and preferably has a durometer on the Shore A scale of about 40-90 (e, g. about 70A), The base cap i ] 2 is preferably bistable, meaning that it is stable (relaxed) in both the inoperative (FIGURE 9) and operative (FIGURES 7 & 10) positions thereof, and "sn s" from one to the other. FIGURES 7 & 10 show the base cap 112 in its operative position after actuation (depression) by a user's finger. In FIGURES 7 & 10 the center portion of the "top" 63 thereof (as seen in FIGURE 10) is concave after the base cap 112 has "'snapped" from its relaxed, inoperative, position of FIGURE 9 in which tire top 63 is convex and the semi-solid mass 1 13 is primarily within the housing 114, to the operative position in which the mass 1 13 is substantially completely exterior of the housing 114 so as to be applied to a body part, or the like, FIGURE 8 schematically illustrates base cap 11.2 in about the position that it would assume when depressed during replacement of a cartridge (e, g. a new plunger 120 with associated new semi-solid mass 113), while FIGURE 9, again, shows the cap 112 when the end cap 1 1 1 is in engagement with the housing 114 closing off the open bottom 61 thereof so that the mass 1 13 is primarily or substantially completely within the housing 114. The base cap 1 12 peripheral portion has surface manifestations, in the form of ring 133 in the embodiment illustrated in FIGURE 10, on the inner surface thereof, for cooperation with the cooperating lip 137 (FIGURE 7) of the housing 114 first end 60. The cap 112 may simply he pushed down on top of the housing 114 first end 60 and it will deform so that the ring 133 snaps into engagement with the lip 137, holding the elements 1 12, 114 securely together. Other surface manifestations aside from a ring and lip may be utilized or in some circumstances the elements 1 12, 1 14 may be permanently affixed together by adhesive, plastic welding, etc, The applicator 1 10 also includes the plunger 120 having first and second ends 62, 63 respectively (FIGURE 7). The first end 62 is operatively connected to the flexible material base cap 112 by engagement of the knob 122, having open space 64 beneath it as viewed in FIGURE. 7, with the surface manifestations (in the form of a ring 132 in the embodiment illustrated in FIGURE 10) of the center tube 131 of the base cap 112, The plunger 120, in this embodiment, includes the shaft 121 havi g a plurality (e. g, four) of vertical ribs 65, and the tray 123 is connectable by locking ribs 68 (FIGURE 7) and 69 (FIGURE .1 1) to the bottom of the plunger shaft 12L In this embodiment between the locking rib 68 and the ribs 65 a preferably unaperiured disc 70 is provided integral with the rest of the shaft 121. The purpose of the disc 70 is to cover the top of the semi-solid mass 113 to protect it from air within the housing 114 and thereby extend the effective life of the mass 113. The tray 123 preferably has the configuration seen most clearly in FIGURE 1 L It includes the peripheral side wall 125 and the plurality of openings 126 provided therein, and tabs or other surface manifestations 72 which help to define the openings 126. The applicator 110 farther comprises the mass of semi-solid material stick product 1 13 mounted on the second end 63 of the plunger 120; specifically the mass 113 fills substantially the entire area within the peripheral side wall 125 of tray 123, and engages the tabs 72 s and extends from the tray 123 through the openings 126 well past the tray 123 as indicated in FIGURE 7. While the removable end cap 1 1 in the FIGURES 1-6 embodiments comprises two different portions, preferably the end cap 1 11 in the FIGURES 7-11 embodiment is a single structure covering the housing 1 14 second end 61 movable from a first position in which it covers the semi-solid material 113 to preclude access thereto, and a second position in which the semi-solid material 13 extends partially out of the second end 63 of the housing 1 14 before the base cap 112 is moved from the FIGURE 9 to the FIGURE 10 position, and a third position wherein the mass 113 is substantially completely exterior of the housing 114 (see. FIGURE 18) after the base cap 112 has been moved to the FIGURE 10 position. The end cap 111 is desirably of transparent plastic such as PETG. As seen in FIGURE 7, the tray 123 has a peripheral section 74 devoid of semi-solid material 113, and the end cap 111 has an annular extension 75 which engages the peripheral section 74 to move the semi-solid material 113 from the second position described above to the first position thereof without necessarily engaging the mass 113 itself. The annular section 75 al o has surface manifestations - such as an internal screw thread (not shown) - which engage cooperating surface manifestations (e, g. external screw threads) 77 on the second end of the housing .1 14 to reieasably hold the end cap 11 1 onto the housing 114 and prevent exterior air from drying out the mass 1 13. Alternatively surface manifestations like 49, 50 in the FIGURES 1 -4 embodiment may be provided, It is desirable that the surface manifestations provide a "click" when the end cap 111 has been securely attached to the housing 1 4. The housing 1 14 also preferably has a guide 139 (FIGURE 17) mounted therein between the first and second ends 60, 61 , thereof. Element 139 guides reciprocal movement of the plunger shaft 121. The guide 139 is preferably supported by a plurality of ribs 140 which also provide a housing-strengthening function. The diameter of the opening in the guide 139 is just slightly larger than the diameter (with ribs 65) of the shaft 121 and knob 122. Stops 141 (FIGURE 17) are also desirably provided in the interior of the generally tubular housing 114. FIGURES 12-14 show an exemplar}' method of assembling an applicator 110 including by making a cartridge of semi-solid material 1 13, As seen in FIGURE 12, the tray 123 is inserted into the open top of the end cap 1 11, which has a molding surface 117 interior thereof. Then as seen in FIGURE 13, hot, or otherwise flowable and curable, stick product is poured into the tray 123. The flowabie mass of stick product w ll flow through the openings 126 (FIGURE 11) in the tray 123 to contact the mold surface ί 17, Once the stick product has cooled or otherwise set to form the semi-solid mass 113 which is integrally bound, to the tray !23} as seen in FIGURE 14 the shaft 121 will be pushed downwardly so that the locking projections 68 (FIGURE 7) and 69 (FIGURE 11) on the shaft 121 and tray 123 w ll hold them together, with the disc 70 covering the top of the mass 1 13, Thus a new cartridge of plunger 120 and semi-solid mass 113 is formed. The new cartridge of plunger 120/mass 1 13 may be inserted into the housing 11.4. First the base cap 1 12 is depressed into the position approximately illustrated in FIGURE 8 and the old plunger shaft 121 is removed. Then the new shaft 121 is passed through the guide 139 so that the knob 122 thereof moves past the ring 132 of tube 1.31 connecting the base cap 112 with the new cartridge, FIGURE 15 shows an embodiment with an alternative configuration of end cap, indicated by reference numeral 21 1, The end cap 21 1 has a mold interior surface (not shown) similar to thai (117) of the end cap i l l, and the surface 75 engaging a cooperating surface 74 of the tray 123 is at the upper end (as viewed in FIGURE 15) thereof. A tab 80 is provided integral with the end cap 211 to facilitate detachment of the semi-solid mass 113 from the end cap 211 once the semi-solid mass has sufficiently cooled, or otherwise set. The end cap 211 configuration is particularly desirable for use with replacement cartridges, and once the cartridge is replaced the end cap 21 1 is discarded, and the end cap 111 is utilized, FIGURE 16 shows another embodiment of the plunger 120 which is preferred in some circumstances, in this embodiment the plunger shaft 121 and tray 123 are integral with each oilier, but the disc 70 is initially detached. After the semi-solid mass 1 13 is formed (integral with the tray 123) then the disc 70 is moved downwardly - as indicated by arrow B in. FIGURE 16 - over the shaft 121 to cover the mass .1 13. A plurality of conventional locking tabs, or like surface manifestations (not shown in FIGURE 16), are provided on the tray 123 just below the shaft 121 so that when the disc 70 is pushed in the direction of arrow 8 to its seated position it snaps over the locking tabs and is held in place covering the mass 113. An exemplary final product, illustrated at 110 in FIGURE 18, can rest on any surface, either the base cap 1 12 engaging a support surface, or the, flat surface 1 18 engaging the support surface. The applicator 1 10 shown in in FIGURE 18 is in the operative position in which the bistable base cap 1 12 has been moved from the FIGURE 9 to the FIGURE 10 positions so that the mass 113 is substantially completely exterior of the housing 114 and available for application to a user's body. All general ranges set forth above include each and every individual range or value within the general range. Also, the applicator ca be of any size desired, which will vary depending upon the type of semi-solid material utilized;, and the semi-solid mass can have any desired shape again depending upon the exact material.
