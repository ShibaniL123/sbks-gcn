Example 32. (R)-3-((3-((7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile
300 mg of (3R)-(+)-1-benzyl-3-aminopyrrolidine was added to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask. After 6.00 mL of deionized water and 274 mg of 6-chloro-7-deazapurine were sequentially added thereto, 470 mg of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) was added to the reaction mixture, and then the reaction mixture was refluxed for about 24 hours and then cooled at room temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted three times with 10.0 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) to collect an organic phase. The collected organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). As a result, 292 mg of (R)-N-(1-benzylpyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 58.5%.
294 mg of (R)-N-(1-benzylpyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 4.00 mL of methanol. After 280 mg of a 10w/w% palladium/carbon (Pd/C) was added thereto, a hydrogen-containing balloon was installed on the reaction flask. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred overnight and then filtered through a Celiteâ„¢ 545 filter agent. The resulting filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 191 mg of (R)-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 94.8%.
60.0 mg of (R)-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.50 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 59.6 mg of 3-cyanobenzenesulfonyl chloride was added to the solution, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0770 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine. The reaction mixture was then stirred overnight at room temperature and then concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 42.0 mg of (R)-3-((3-((7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile was obtained with a yield of about 38.2%.
