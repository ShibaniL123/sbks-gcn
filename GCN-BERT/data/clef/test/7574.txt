The present invention relates to a class of oxazoline derivatives, and to their use in therapy. These compounds are of benefit as pharmaceutical agents, especially in the treatment of adverse inflammatory, autoimmune and oncological disorders, in the treatment of viral diseases, and in the management of organ and cell transplant rejection. In addition, the compounds in accordance with the present invention may be beneficial as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests and in the search for new pharmacological agents. Thus, the compounds of this invention may be useful as radioligands in assays for detecting pharmacologically active compounds. WO 2010/103130 describes a family of oxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine, thiazolo[5,4-d]-pyrimidine, thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine and purine derivatives that are active in a range of assays, including the Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR) test, and are stated to be effective for the treatment of immune and auto-immune disorders, and organ and cell transplant rejection.

Particular categories of cancer include haematological malignancy (including leukaemia and lymphoma) and non-haematological malignancy (including solid tumour cancer, sarcoma, meningioma, glioblastoma multiforme, neuroblastoma, melanoma, gastric carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma). Chronic leukaemia may be myeloid or lymphoid.

Organ transplant rejection includes the rejection of transplanted or grafted organs or cells (both allografts and xenografts), including graft-versus-host reaction disease. The term “organ” as used herein means all organs or parts of organs in mammals, particularly humans, including kidney, lung, bone marrow, hair, cornea, eye (vitreous), heart, heart valve, liver, pancreas, blood vessel, skin, muscle, bone, intestine and stomach. The term “rejection” as used herein means all reactions of the recipient body or the transplanted organ which ultimately lead to cell or tissue death in the transplanted organ, or adversely affect the functional ability and viability of the transplanted organ or the recipient. In particular, this means acute and chronic rejection reactions. Cell transplant rejection includes the rejection of cell transplants and xeno-transplantation. The major hurdle for xenotransplantation is that even before the T lymphocytes (responsible for the rejection of allografts) are activated, the innate immune system (especially T-independent B lymphocytes and macrophages) is activated. This provokes two types of severe and early acute rejection, referred to as hyperacute rejection and vascular rejection respectively. Conventional immunosuppressant drugs, including cyclosporine A, are ineffective in xenotransplantation. The compounds in accordance with the present invention are not liable to this drawback. The ability of the compounds of this invention to suppress T-independent xeno-antibody production as well as macrophage activation may be demonstrated by their ability to prevent xenograft rejection in athymic, T-deficient mice receiving xenogenic hamster-heart grafts.

Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles or preservatives. The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavouring agents, colouring agents or sweetening agents, as appropriate.

Where they are not commercially available, the starting materials of formula (VII), (X), (XIA) and (XIB) may be prepared by methods analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples, or by standard methods well known from the art. It will be understood that any compound of formula (I) initially obtained from any of the above processes may, where appropriate, subsequently be elaborated into a further compound of formula (I) by techniques known from the art. Where a mixture of products is obtained from any of the processes described above for the preparation of compounds according to the invention, the desired product can be separated therefrom at an appropriate stage by conventional methods such as preparative HPLC; or column chromatography utilising, for example, silica and/or alumina in conjunction with an appropriate solvent system. Where the above-described processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques. In particular, where it is desired to obtain a particular enantiomer of a compound of formula (I) this may be produced from a corresponding mixture of enantiomers using any suitable conventional procedure for resolving enantiomers. Thus, for example, diastereomeric derivatives, e.g. salts, may be produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers of formula (I), e.g. a racemate, and an appropriate chiral compound, e.g. a chiral base. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallisation, and the desired enantiomer recovered, e.g. by treatment with an acid in the instance where the diastereomer is a salt. In another resolution process a racemate of formula (I) may be separated using chiral HPLC. Moreover, if desired, a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropriate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described above. Alternatively, a particular enantiomer may be obtained by performing an enantiomer-specific enzymatic biotransformation, e.g. an ester hydrolysis using an esterase, and then purifying only the enantiomerically pure hydrolysed acid from the unreacted ester antipode. Chromatography, recrystallisation and other conventional separation procedures may also be used with intermediates or final products where it is desired to obtain a particular geometric isomer of the invention. During any of the above synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J. F. W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T. W. Greene & P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, 3rd edition, 1999. The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient subsequent stage utilising methods known from the art. The following Examples illustrate the preparation of compounds according to the invention. The compounds in accordance with this invention are potent inhibitors when measured in the MLR test described below. The Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR) Test Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coats, obtained from healthy blood donors by Ficoll (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) density-gradient centrifugation. The cells at the Ficoll-plasma interface were washed three times and used as “Responder” cells. RPMI 1788 (ATCC, No CCL-156) cells were treated with mitomycin C (Kyowa, Nycomed, Brussels, Belgium) and used as “Stimulator” cells. Responder cells (0.12×106), Stimulator cells (0.045×106) and compounds (in different concentrations) were cocultured for 6 days in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Lonza, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml Geneticin (Gibco, LifeTechnologies, UK). Cells were cultured in triplicate in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter tissue culture plates (TTP, Switzerland). After 5 days, cells were pulsed with 1 μCi of methyl-3H thymidine (MP Biomedicals, USA), harvested 18 h later on glass filter paper and counted. Proliferation values were expressed as counts per minute (cpm), and converted to % inhibition with respect to a blank MLR test (identical but without added compound). The IC50 was determined from a graph with at least four points, each derived from the mean of 2 experiments. The IC50 value represents the lowest concentration of test compound (expressed in μM) that resulted in a 50% inhibition of the MLR. The compounds of the accompanying Examples were all found to generate IC50 values in the MLR test of 10 μM or better.
