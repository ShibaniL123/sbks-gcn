Step 6
3,7-Dimethyl-1-((2-oxo-1-oxa-3-azaspiro[4.5]decane-8-yl)methyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
3,7-Dimethyl-1-(2-oxo-1-oxa-3-azaspiro[4.5]decane-8-yl)methyl methanesulfonate (285 mg, 1.08 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (5mL), and then potassium carbonate (300 mg, 2.16 mmol), potassium iodide (18.0 mg, 0.100 mmol) and 3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6 (3H,7H)-dione (205 mg, 1.13 mmol) were added. The reaction was heated to 120Â°C to react for 2 hours. The reaction solution was diluted with ethyl acetate (20 mL), washed with brine (20 mL x 2), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) to give 3,7-dimethyl-(5-oxo-1-oxa-3-azaspiro[4.5]decane-8-yl)methyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (50.0 mg) with a yield of 13%.
