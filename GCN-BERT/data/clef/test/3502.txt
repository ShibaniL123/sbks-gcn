CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims benefit to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/387,577 filed on Sep. 29, 2010, which application is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD The present disclosure generally relates to methods and compositions for treating skin. In some embodiments, the method uses an exfoliation tool. In some embodiments, the method uses an exfoliation tool together with selected skin care agents or compositions. BACKGROUND Proper skin care is important for heath and cosmetic reasons. Skin is a vital organ and a breakdown in the skin can adversely affect the skin's function as a barrier and make it susceptible to infection. A breakdown in the skin can also be very painful, such as the case of excessive dry skin. Visual irregularities in the skin can adversely affect a person's confidence and other people's perceptions. There remains a need for improved methods of treating skin and maintaining or improving its health and cosmetic features. It is against this background that the present disclosure is made. SUMMARY Surprisingly, it has been found that using an exfoliation tool together with selected skin care agents results in improved skin health and appearance. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present disclosure relates to a method of treating skin where a user applies a first skin care agent to skin and treats the skin with an exfoliation tool. In some embodiments, the method also includes additional skin care agents. In some embodiments, the method uses a specific treatment regimen. In some embodiments, the present disclosure relates to a kit that includes an exfoliation tool and selected skin care agents. The kit can also include specific instructions that explain how to use the exfoliation tool and selected skin care agents. Finally, in some embodiments, the present disclosure relates to methods of treating skin using an exfoliation tool and selected skin care compositions. These and other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art and others in view of the following detailed description. It should be understood, however, that this summary, and the detailed description illustrate only some examples of various embodiments, and are not intended to be limiting to the claimed invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows a view of the exfoliation tool. FIG. 2 shows a close up of the exfoliation tool head, including the roller and the acupuncture needles. FIG. 3 shows a person using the exfoliation tool on their face. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure generally relates to skin treatment using an exfoliation tool and selected skin care agents. While not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that the combination of the exfoliation tool and the selected skin care agents increases the uptake of the selected skin care agents by the epidermis (outer layer of skin) than if the skin care agent was just placed on top of the epidermis. This is believed to be in part because the exfoliation tool increases the surface area of the epidermis by creating micro pores or holes in the skin, thereby allowing a greater number of skin cells on the epidermis to contact and benefit from the selected skin care agent. One result of this is that a user can see improved results in a shorter period of time. The Exfoliation Tool The exfoliation tool of the present disclosure is designed to create micro pores, channels, or holes in the epidermis or outer layer of the skin. In some embodiments, the exfoliation tool is a roller attached to a handle or wand, such as that shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 1 generally shows an exfoliation tool 10. The exfoliation tool 10 includes a handle or wand 12 and a head 14 attached to the handle 12. The head 14 includes a roller 16. The roller 16 is held in place by a U-shaped collar 18 that is attached to the handle or wand 12 and engages the roller 16 at either end in such a way that allows the roller 16 to rotate. The roller 16 includes a plurality of acupuncture needles 20. FIG. 1 shows the acupuncture needles 20 in rows, but it is understood that the needles may be arranged in a variety of configurations. The exfoliation tool 10 is preferably easily manufactured. In some embodiments, the handle 12, head 14, including the collar 18 and the roller 16 are injection molded plastic. The acupuncture needles 20 are preferably stainless steel, and more preferably surgical grade stainless steel. FIG. 2 shows a close up of the head 14, including the collar 18, roller 16, and acupuncture needles 20. The acupuncture needles 20 preferably form micro holes, pores, or channels in the epidermis of the skin. It is understood that other structures may be used instead of acupuncture needles. When using acupuncture needles, the needles are preferably solid and made of stainless steel. The needles are preferably from about 0.1 mm to about 0.5 mm in length so that when the exfoliation tool is placed on skin and rolled using moderate pressure, the needles penetrate only the epidermis, and not the deeper layers of skin. In some embodiments, the needles do not penetrate more than about 100 microns to 500 microns into the epidermis. FIG. 3 shows a person 22 using the exfoliation tool of FIG. 1 on their face. In some embodiments, the exfoliation tool can be scaled slightly smaller for use on the face or slightly larger for use on the body or scalp, reflecting the respective differences in surface area of the face versus the rest of the body or scalp. During use on the face, it may be beneficial to divide the face into sections such as the forehead, right side, left side, chin, and neck. A user may then roll the head of the exfoliation tool of FIG. 1 over each section using moderate pressure. In some embodiments, it may be beneficial for the user to change the rolling direction with each pass. A similar method can be used when treating other body parts or the scalp (i.e., dividing into sections and rolling the exfoliation tool over the various sections, changing the rolling direction from time to time).

EXAMPLES The present disclosure may be better understood with reference to the following example. Thus example is intended to be representative of specific embodiments of the disclosure, and is not intended as limiting the scope of the disclosure. Example 1 Example 1 determined the effect of the exfoliation tool on skin's water balance, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), corneometry, and skin elasticity. Also evaluated were the visual effects on skin smoothness, softness, and texture. The example compared a skin care regimen of a mask, toner, day cream, serum capsule, and night cream both with and without the use of an exfoliation tool in improving skin appearance. Thirty female subjects over the age of 35 were enrolled in an 8-week, single site, investigator-blinded study. Twenty subjects used a skin care treatment regimen consisting of a cleansing mask, toner, day cream, serum capsules, and night cream. In addition, these subjects also used an exfoliation tool nightly (every other night for the first 2 weeks, then nightly thereafter). Ten subjects used only the skin care regimen without the exfoliation tool. Investigator assessments, subject assessments, photography, and noninvasive assessments were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the two treatment arms. Subjects were evaluated at the following time points: baseline, 5 minutes, week 2, week 4, and week 8. Subjects using the exfoliation tool were instructed to use the cleansing mask, toner, and day cream in the morning and use the cleansing mask, toner, exfoliation tool, serum capsules, and night cream in the evening in that order. Subjects that did not use the exfoliation tool followed the same protocol but did not use the exfoliation tool in the evening. Subject were given the following directions for the products and the exfoliation tool if applicable: Product 1 Cleansing Mask: Using wet fingertips, gently and evenly massage a quarter-sized amount onto dry skin. Ensure entire face is covered with a thin coat of product, avoiding contact with eyes. Allow product to dry completely, about 2-3 minutes. Rinse thoroughly; pat dry. Product 2 Toner: Shake well before use. Apply evenly to entire face with a gauze pad, avoiding the eye area. Do not rinse off. Allow to dry. Product 3 Day Cream SPF 30: Apply a dime-sized amount over entire face every morning. Avoid eye area. Product 4 Serum Capsules: Open capsule and apply serum to the entire face evenly. Use only in the evening. Product 5 Night Cream: Apply a dime-sized amount over entire face every evening. Exfoliation Tool: For Week 1 and Week 2, use tool every other night after Products 1 and 2. For Weeks 3-8, increase to nightly use as tolerated. With moderate and comfortable pressure, roll the tool over entire face and neck 4-10 times. For best results, divide the face into sections (forehead, right side, left side, chin, neck) and treat each section before continuing onto the next. Change the orientation of rolling over each section to ensure complete surface coverage. After rolling, apply Product 4 (one Serum Capsule) over entire face and neck and follow with Product 5 (Night Cream). Subjects were evaluated by collecting observations at baseline, 5 minutes, week 2, week 4, and week 8. A dermatologist investigator performed all visual assessments. The parameters evaluated consisted of: investigator evaluations, subject evaluations, subject marketing questionnaire, noninvasive assessments (TEWL, corneometry, elasticity), and photography. The rating scale for evaluation for all subject and investigator assessments was: 0=none, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe. After the 8-week study, the following results or observations were made: The corneometry difference from baseline showed that there was no statistically significant benefit in skin moisturization with the exfoliation tool in addition to the skin care products versus using the skin care products alone. Corneometry is a measure of the conductivity of the skin utilizing water as the conductor. More water in the skin indicates superior hydration, thus a higher corneometry measurement is more favorable.Both groups (with and without the exfoliation tool) showed a statistically significant improvement in skin moisturization at weeks 2, 4, and 8. This finding points to the ability of the skin care regimen to significantly improve skin moisturization. It is worthwhile noting that the addition of the exfoliation tool to the skin care products produced highly statistically significant (p<0.001) improvement in moisturization at weeks 2 and 4, which was not the case with the skin care product alone group.The corneometry numbers were noticeably higher in the group that used the exfoliation tool, especially at week 4. This might directionally point to the value of the exfoliation tool in improving skin hydration.The investigator noted improvements within both groups over the 8 weeks. At week 2, the investigator noted a statistically significant improvement in skin texture in all subjects. A statistically significant improvement was seen in fine lines, skin texture, and overall appearance with both groups at week 4. Finally, at week 8, statistically significant improvement was seen in fine lines, skin texture, and overall appearance. Thus, the skin care regimen was successful in improving skin appearance.The investigator direct comparison did not show any statistically significant differences between the exfoliation tool plus skin care products and the skin care products group alone. This could be due to the small sample size or the short study period. It is possible that new collagen production from the exfoliation tool might take longer than 12 weeks.No changes in skin elasticity were seen between the exfoliation tool plus skin care product group and the skin care product group alone. Skin elasticity is more variable in its interpretation than the corneometry measurements. Three elasticity measurements were obtained. The elasticity measurements were obtained with a suction cup that stretched the skin into the cup under negative vacuum pressure. Once the skin was stretched into the top of the cup, such that a light beam at the top of the cup was broken, the negative vacuum pressure was discontinued and the skin relaxed. This sequence of events was repeated three times. With each subsequent iteration of the suction and relaxation, the skin becomes stretchier and stretchier and the numbers decreased. Thus, the skin becomes more elastic with stretching.There was no intragroup difference in skin elasticity between the exfoliation tool plus skin care product group and the skin care product group alone. However, it is important to look at the absolute numbers, since the sample size was small. The skin elasticity numbers were higher in the exfoliation tool group than in the skin treatment alone group. This means that it took more energy to deform the skin of the subjects that used the exfoliation tool, which can be interpreted as firmer skin possibly due to a higher water content.No statistically significant differences in skin elasticity were seen on direct comparison between the exfoliation tool plus skin care products and skin care products alone group. Again, it is important to note that the elasticity measurements were higher at week 8 in the group that used the exfoliation tool plus the skin care products. This means that the exfoliation tool improved skin firmness directionally.The subject difference from baseline was used to analyze intergroup changes. No statistically significant changes were seen between subject assessments in the exfoliation tool plus skin care products group or the skin care products alone group at weeks 2, 4, or 8.The intragroup longitudinal assessment demonstrated that while both groups of subjects assessed improvement, the improvement was rated more dramatic in the group that used the exfoliation tool and skin care products as opposed to the skin care products alone group. At week 2, there was a statistically significant improvement in skin softness (p=0.032), skin radiance (p=0.008), skin evenness (p=0.002), pore appearance (p=0.012), wrinkles (p=0.006), fine lines (p=0.009), and brown spots (p=0.009). This is improvement in more attributes than the skin care product alone group. Statistically significant improvement was seen in softness, radiance, pores, fine lines, and brown spots with the exfoliation tool at week 2, which was not the case with the skin care products alone. However, the skin care products also elicited excellent ratings by the subjects. There was statistically significant improvement in evenness (p=0.011) and wrinkles (p=0.022) at week 2. By week 4, there was statistically significant improvement in both groups in terms of radiance, evenness, pores, and wrinkles. At week 4, the exfoliation tool plus product group outperformed the product group alone with additional statistically significant improvement in fines lines (p<0.001), brown spots (p<0.001), and dryness (p=0.047). The subject assessed differences were the greatest at week 8. The exfoliation tool group assessed statistically significant improvements in radiance, evenness, pore appearance, wrinkles, fine lines, brown spots, and dryness. No statistically significant increase in irritation was noted pointing toward an excellent tolerability profile for the exfoliation tool. The subjects who used the skin care products alone assessed statistically significant improvement in radiance and evenness. This means that the use of the exfoliation tool added an incremental benefit in pore appearance, wrinkles, fine lines, brown spots and dryness.The direct comparison results were similar to the difference from baseline results and failed to show much statistically significant intergroup difference. It appears that with the study design and small sample size, the longitudinal analysis was best able to elicit the subtle differences between the two study groups.No statistically significant differences in TEWL were seen between the exfoliation tool plus study products group and the study products alone group.TEWL is a measure of the water leaving the skin. Indeed, TEWL was increased in the group using the exfoliation tool. This means that the exfoliation tool did penetrate the skin barrier and allow more water to escape. A statistically significant increase in water loss was seen with the exfoliation tool users as compared to baseline at week 2 (p=0.032) and week 4 (p=0.013). The change was not statistically significant at week 8. No statistically significant changes in TEWL were seen in the product use alone group. The TEWL evaluation demonstrates the ability of the exfoliation tool to produce a physiologic effect on the skin.No statistically significant differences in TEWL were seen in the intergroup direct comparison analysis. This means that the exfoliation tool did not damage the skin in a negative fashion.
