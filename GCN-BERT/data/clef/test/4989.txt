No. 13/291,713, now allowed, which claims benefit of priority to Taiwan Patent Application Serial Number 099138437, filed on Nov. 9, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a bio-impedance measurement apparatus, and relates more particularly to a bio-impedance measurement apparatus having wireless communication capability. 2. Description of the Related Art During the 1950s, Dr. Reinhard Voll studied acupuncture points and discovered there are nearly 2000 acupuncture points on the skin of a human body, and those acupuncture points are distributed along the paths called meridians. In accordance with traditional Chinese medicine theory, the meridians are channels for transmission of energy, and the transmitted energy is known as “chi.” Western research discovered that acupuncture points can be identified by low direct current resistance of the skin. In other words, acupuncture points are specific superficial anatomic locations. At these locations, the skin resistance is lower than that of the surrounding skin. Dr. Voll further discovered that organ health can be determined by the measurement of the impedance of acupuncture points corresponding to specific organs. In addition, electric therapy studies showed that when therapy signals are repetitively directed into acupuncture points, the impedance of the acupuncture points can be restored, and the corresponding organs can be treated. U.S. Pat. No. 4,981,146, U.S. Pat. No. 5,397,338, U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,617, U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,480 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0,197,555 disclose treatment methods or methods of monitoring the health of human bodies using acupuncture points. Conventionally, a bio-impedance measuring device and a metal probe are applied to measure the impedance of acupuncture points. Such measurement is non-invasive and the metal probe does not pierce the subject's body, and one acupuncture point can be measured in each measurement. However, the accuracy of traditional bio-impedance measuring devices is adversely affected by poor electrical contact between the probe and the skin. Usually, when one acupuncture point is measured, several measurements at different nearby locations are required so as to obtain stable and reliable skin resistance information. As shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, Dr. Voll discovered many electrically conductive points (acupuncture points) on the hands and feet of the human body. Because traditional bio-impedance measuring devices can manually measure only one acupuncture point at a time, thus measuring the acupuncture points of hands and feet of a human subject to obtain stable and reliable skin resistance information is very time-consuming. Furthermore, acupuncture points lie under the thick cuticle of the skin so that impedance is often measured higher than its true value, causing erroneous measuring results. Due to the disadvantages of traditional bio-impedance measuring devices, a new, more efficient and reliable bio-impedance measuring device is needed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One objective of the present invention is to provide a bio-impedance measurement apparatus including a probe configured to pierce the skin for accurate measurement of acupuncture point impedance. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a bio-impedance measurement apparatus including a wireless device disposed for transmitting acupuncture point codes and impedance information to a remote control station for analysis. Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an assembly of a plurality of bio-impedance measurement apparatuses and a plurality of wireless devices wearable on the body and configured to simultaneously measure the impedance of plural acupuncture points. In accordance with the above and other objectives, the present invention proposes a bio-impedance measurement apparatus comprising a flexible band member, two probe sets, a measurement device, and a wireless device. The flexible band member is configured to be fastened around a body portion, comprising an inner surface disposed adjacent to a skin region of the body portion when the flexible band member is fastened to the body portion. The two probe sets are attached to the flexible band member. Each probe set comprises a probe, wherein the probe of one probe set includes a tip portion configured to protrude from the inner surface to pierce the skin so as to be located adjacent to an acupuncture point, and the probe of another probe set is configured to contact the reference skin as an electrical ground. The measurement device is disposed on the flexible band member, electrically coupled to the two probe sets, and configured to provide a pulse current signal to the acupuncture point and to measure impedance of the acupuncture point. The wireless device is coupled to the measurement device, configured to transmit an acupuncture code corresponding to the acupuncture point and the impedance information of the acupuncture point to the remote monitor station In one embodiment, the measurement device provides an impulse current signal to the acupuncture point, causing a voltage generated between the acupuncture point and the electrical ground. The measurement device can amplify the voltage signal and convert the amplified signal into a digital signal using an analog/digital converter. The measurement device can obtain the impedance of the acupuncture point by performing a Fourier transformation of the digital signal. In one embodiment, the measured voltage signal can be transmitted to a remote control station, which performs a Fourier transformation to obtain the impedance of the acupuncture point. One embodiment of the present invention provides a wearable assembly for measuring bio-impedance comprising a glove and the above-mentioned bio-impedance measurement apparatus.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 4 is a view showing a bio-impedance measurement apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 5 is a perspective view showing a bio-impedance measurement apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention, in which the chip device 10 and probe sets 12 and 13 are on a flexible band member 11. FIG. 6 is a perspective view showing a bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1 according to one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 6 is a view showing a bio-impedance measurement system 2 according to one embodiment of the present invention. The bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1 comprises a flexible band member 11, two probe sets 12 and 13, and a chip device 10. The flexible band member 11 as in FIG. 5 is configured to be fastened around a body portion such as a head, a limb, a trunk, a shoulder, a neck, a finger or a toe. The flexible band member 11 includes an inner surface 111 that is adjacent to a skin region of the body portion when the flexible band member 11 is fastened to the body portion. The flexible band member 11 can be a ring member that can be directly worn on limbs, fingers, a trunk, or toes. The flexible band member 11 can include free distal ends (e.g. a rope), configured to be wrapped around a body portion. The pair of probe sets 12 and 13 is attached to the flexible band member 11. In the present embodiment, the probe sets 12 and 13 are configured to measure the impedance of acupuncture points. The probe set 12 and the probe set 13 can be separated from each other, and are configured to contact or pierce the skin and form a loop circuit for measuring impedance of acupuncture points. Referring to FIG. 10, the probe set 12 may comprise at least one probe 121 comprising a tip portion 122 configured to protrude from the inner surface 111 and be able to pierce the skin so as to be located adjacent to an acupuncture point to be measured. In particular, the tip portion 122 can be trimmed to include a surface inclined at an angle of from 5 to 55 degrees, forming a sharp point so that the tip portion 122 can easily pierce the skin. In one embodiment, the tip portion 122 can be trimmed at an angle of 45 degrees. If the trimming angle is too small, the contact area between the probe and the skin will be reduced, increasing measured impedance. If the trimming angle is too large, the piercing depth will be adversely affected, increasing measured impedance as well. Furthermore, the tip portion 122 is can be configured to pierce into a specific skin layer such as the dermis so that accurate measurements can be obtained. Similarly, the probe set 13 can comprise at least one probe 131, which may comprise a tip portion 132 configured to protrude from the inner surface 111 of the flexible band member 11. The tip portion 132 can contact the skin or pierce the skin. Likewise, the tip portion 132 can be trimmed to include a surface inclined at an angle of from 5 to 55 degrees, forming a sharp point so that the tip portion 132 can easily pierce the skin. If the trimming angle is too small, the contact area between the probe and the skin will be reduced, increasing measured impedance. If the trimming angle is too large, the piercing depth will be adversely affected, increasing measured impedance as well. The probes 121 and 131 can be made of material compatible with the skin. The probes 121 and 131 can include a coating. The probes 121 and 131 can comprise material coated with a coating, wherein the material is stainless steel, tungsten, or nickel chromium, and the coating is gold, titanium nitride, or titanium. Referring to FIGS. 1, 4, and 5, the bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1 may comprise two pairs of probe sets 12 and 13 disposed in accordance with acupuncture points. In one embodiment, the two probe sets 12 of the embodiment of FIG. 5 can be disposed in accordance with the acupuncture point NE2 and the acupuncture point LA2, and another pair of probe sets 13 can be disposed at positions where no acupuncture point is located such that when the bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1 is worn on an index finger, the impedance of the acupuncture points NE2 and LA2 can be measured simultaneously. In another embodiment, the apparatus of FIG. 4 comprises two pairs of bio-impedance measurement apparatuses 1a and 1b, in which two pairs of probe sets 12 are disposed in accordance with the acupuncture points LA1a and LA2, and another two pairs of probe sets 13 are disposed at positions where no acupuncture point is located such that when the bio-impedance measurement apparatuses 1a and 1b are worn on an index finger, the impedance of the acupuncture points LA2 and LA1a can be measured simultaneously. Further, each probe set 12 or 13 can comprise a plurality of probes 121 and 131. The plurality of probes 121 or 131 can be arranged in an array. Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the chip device 10 can be disposed on the outer surface 112 of the flexible band member 11, connected with the corresponding probe sets 12 and 13 by conductive wires 110 and 113 disposed on the outer surface 112. Referring to FIG. 6, the chip device 10 may comprise a measurement device 14 and a wireless device 15. The measurement device 14 is electrically coupled to the two probe sets 12 and 13 by conductive wires 110 and 113, which are configured to provide impulse current signals required to measure the impedance of acupuncture points. Meanwhile, the measurement device 14 can detect the voltage response signals between acupuncture points and electrical ground, and amplify the voltage response signals. The amplified voltage response signals are sampled by an analog/digital converter and converted into digital signals which are then processed by Fourier transformation in the measurement device 14. Finally, the impedance between acupuncture points and the electrical ground can be obtained. The wireless device 15 in FIG. 6 may be coupled to the measurement device 14, thereby transmitting the code of a measured acupuncture point and its impedance to a remote control monitor station 21. Although the present embodiment demonstrates that the measurement device 14 and the wireless device 15 are integrated into the chip device 10, the present invention is not limited to such an arrangement. In another embodiment, the sampled voltage signals are directly transmitted to the remote controlling monitor station 21 without any processing, and the received signals are then processed by Fourier transformation to obtain the code and the impedance of the measured acupuncture point. Referring to FIG. 5, the bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1 may further comprise two metal layers 114 and 115 used as ground reference points.

Specifically, as shown in FIG. 6, the present invention provides another bio-impedance measurement system 2, which comprises a bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1 and a remote control monitor station 21 comprising a wireless device 211. The wireless device 211 of the remote control monitor station 21 and the wireless device 15 of the bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1 can communicate with each other by a wireless communication protocol. The communication protocol may define the names and codes of acupuncture points and the format of impedance information so that communicated information can be demodulated and identified. The remote control monitor station 21 can receive, store and analyze the codes and impedance information of acupuncture points transmitted from the bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1.

The modulator 154 may be coupled to the antenna 151 and configured to modulate transmitting signals and/or demodulate received signals. In particular, the rectifying module 152 can be coupled to a capacitor 155 for stabilizing electricity supply. In addition, the oscillating module 153 may comprise a resistor 156 and a capacitor 157. Alternatively, the oscillating module 153 may be a multi-vibrator.

FIG. 8 is a view showing a measurement device 14 according to one embodiment of the present invention. The measurement device 14 may comprise a processor 141, a memory module 142, an analog/digital converter 143, a voltage amplifier 144, and a pulse current generator 145. The probe sets 12 and 13 are individually coupled to the pulse current generator 145 by conductive wires 110 and 113. The voltage response signals produced after acupuncture points receive impulse current signals are initially transmitted to the voltage amplifier 144, and then transmitted to the analog/digital converter 143, which samples analog signals from the voltage amplifier 144 and converts them to digital signals, which are then transmitted to the processor 141. The processor 141 is configured to perform Fourier transformation and thereby processes the voltage response signals produced after acupuncture points receive impulse current signals provided by the bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1 to calculate the impedance of the acupuncture points. Further, the processor 141 may initiate the programs associated with wireless communication and keep each part of the bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1 in normal operation. The memory module 142 is coupled to the processor 141 for temporarily or permanently storing the data required for the operation of the bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1 or programs for the device. For example, the memory module 142 stores the data such as measured impedance information of acupuncture points, impulse current signal information for acupuncture points, operating programs for the bio-impedance measurement apparatus 1, and a Fourier transformation program. In another embodiment, sampled voltages are directly transmitted to the remote control monitor station 21, and then converted by Fourier transformation. Consequently, the impedance information between acupuncture points and ground reference can be obtained. The probe sets 12 and 13, coupled to the pulse current generator 145, are configured to measure the impedance between acupuncture points and electrical ground. The pulse current generator 145 can communicate with the voltage amplifier 144 so that the voltage amplifier 144 can amplify the voltage signals produced on the probe sets 12 and 13 coupled to the pulse current generator 145. The voltage amplifier 144 can be coupled with the analog/digital converter 143, which can convert the analog signals from the voltage amplifier 144 into digital signals. Referring to FIG. 15, in one embodiment, the processor 141 can send a voltage signal Vi(t) to the pulse current generator 145 for generating impulse current I(t) in a range of from 1 microampere to 100 microamperes, which is supplied to acupuncture points via the conductive wire 110 and the probe set 12. In addition, the ground terminal of the pulse current generator 145 is connected to the probe set 13 via the conductive wires 113. The impulse current I(t) flows through an acupuncture point having impedance that can be represented by an equivalent circuit including a capacitor C2 and resistors R4 and R5, causing a voltage drop. This voltage can be amplified to an output voltage Vo(t) by a voltage amplifier such as an operational amplifier 503 including resistors R6 and R7. The voltage Vo(t) is then transmitted to the analog/digital converter 143, converting it into a sampled digital signal VD(t), which is then sent to the processor 141.
