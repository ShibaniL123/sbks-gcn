DESCRIPTION THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR DYSLIPIDEMIA Technical Field [0001] The present invention relates to a composition containing a compound (1) selectively activating an a-type (PPARa) of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, which are intended to prevent and/or treat atherosclerosis, and a lipemia condition such as hypercholesterolemia; and a combination thereof. Background Art [0002] In recent years, due to the westernization of diet, patients with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypo-HDL chloesterolemia, and the like, which are in the category of a so-called lifestyle-related diseases, are in an increasing trend. Further, recently, patients with mixed or combined dyslipidemia, which has both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, have been increased. Especially in patients with mixed dyslipidemia, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) are increased, and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) is decreased. Such a high TG and low HDL-C condition is also observed in patients with metabolic syndrome or diabetes. It has been proved that hyper LDL-cholesterolemia, hypo-HDL cholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia are risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) or cerebral vascular disorder and the like. The importance of the management of dyslipidemia is described in "Guidelines for Preventing Arteriosclerotic Diseases, 2012 edition" released by Japan Athèrosclerosis Society. [0003] Dyslipidemia, in particular, hypercholesterolemia has already fallen into a disease area of high medical satisfaction with the advent of statins. However, from the results of a large number of large-scale clinical trials, it has been found that the further decrease of blood LDL cholesterol level leads to the prevention of coronary artery disease (the lower the better) , and the more strict lipid control is recommended. There are a large number of patients who cannot reach the intended level of blood LDL-C only by the statins, and treatment with a combination of multiple agents has been required. On the other hand, for the hypertriglyceridemia, it has been indicated that fibrate-based agents more effectively reduce the level, and for the hypo-HDL cholesterolemia, research and development of CETP inhibitors, apo A-I increasing agents, and the like has been carried out. In particular, it has been expected that blood HDL-C increasing drugs are increasingly important in the future from the viewpoint of reverse transfer of cholesterol, and evolution suppression and regression of arteriosclerosis, (Non-Patent Document 1). [0004] PPAR is one of the receptors that belong to a nuclear receptor family. It has been known of the presence of three subtypes (α, γ, and δ) in the receptor (Non-Patent Document 2) . Among them, PPARa is mainly expressed in the liver, and when PPARa is activated, production of apo C-III is suppressed, and then lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is activated, as a result, fat is decomposed. As the PPARa agonist, unsaturated fatty acids; fibrate-based agents such as fenofibrate, bezafibrate, and gemfibrozil; and the like have been known (Non-Patent Document 3) . Further, in recent years, a compound, which has a PPARa activating effect more strongly and selectively than the conventional f ibrate-based agent does, has been reported (Patent Documents 1 to 10). [0005] A cholesterol absorption inhibitor is an agent suppressing the absorption of dietary cholesterol from the small intestine. As to the factors to determine the blood cholesterol level, it is considered that contribution of de novo synthesized cholesterol in the liver is 70℅, and contribution of the dietary cholesterol is 30%, therefore, the blood cholesterol levels can be reduced by the suppression of the absorption of dietary cholesterol from the small intestine, independently from the cholesterol synthesis inhibition by statins. As the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, for example, ezetimibe (Zetia (registered trademark)) has been known. The mechanism of its action was unknown for a long time, however, recently the mechanism that the absorption of cholesterol is suppressed by the inhibition of a cholesterol transporter (Niemann-Pick Cl-likel, NPC1-L1) expressed in the small intestinal epithelial cells has been elucidated. In addition to ezetimibe, multiple compounds having an inhibitory effect on the cholesterol transporter have been reported (Patent Documents 11 to 14). [0006] Treatments with a combination of the above-described fibrate-based agent with ezetimibe have been investigated for patients with mixed dyslipidemia who have a feature that the blood LDL-C level and the blood TG level are increased, and the blood HDL-C level is decreased (Patent Document 15, and Non-Patent Documents 4 and 5) . Meanwhile, it has not been known what kind of effect is exerted on the dyslipidemia if a compound (1) of the present invention is used in combination with ezetimibe.

In parallel to the loading with the high cholesterol diet, a vehicle (an aqueous solution of 0.5% methylcellulose: MC) , or (R)-2-[3-[[Ν-(benzoxazol-2-yl)-Ν-3-(4-methoxyphenoxy)propyl ]aminomethyljphenoxy]butyric acid (compound A) and/or ezetimibe was orally administered once a day. In the afternoon of the last day of the administration, blood was collected under pentobarbital anesthesia after the fasting period of 4 hours, and the HDL-C levels in the plasma were measured. The synergistic effect was determined by using Bürgi's formula (if the relative level in the combined group is larger than the value of the product of the relative level of single agent A and the relative level of single agent Β, the synergistic effect is positive). 2. Group Configuration Group 1 : Control Group 2 : Compound A 0.1 mg/kg Group 3: Ezetimibe 0.003 mg/kg Group 4: Compound A 0.1 mg/kg and ezetimibe 0.003 mg/kg 3. Statistical Analysis and Data Processing Method The results were shown as the mean ± standard deviation. Comparison between the control group and the drug administration group was performed using Dunnett's multiple comparison test, and the risk rate of less than 5% was determined to have a significant difference. 4. Results The results are shown in FIG. 1 and Table 1. In addition, the average level of each group of HDL-C is shown in Table 1. In the single administration group of compound A or ezetimibe, apparent effects were not recognized for the HDL-C level. However, in the combined administration group of 0.1 mg/kg of compound A and 0.003 mg/kg of ezetimibe, significant (*:p<0.05, to the control) and synergistic (the relative level (1.167) in the combined group is larger than the value of the product (1.010 χ 1.022 = 1.032) of the relative level in the single agent A administration group to the control group and the relative level in the single agent Β administration group to the control group) increase of HDL-C level was recognized (FIG. 1, and Table 1).

Procedure SD rats (6 weeks old, male, CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES JAPAN, INC.) were used in the experiments. Blood was collected from the jugular vein of chow-fed rat, and divided into 6 groups (Ν = 6, 8) base on the levels of TG and TC in the plasma, and the body weight. From the next day, a solid food containing 2% cholesterol and 0.5% sodium cholate (MF-based, Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd.) was loaded to rats for one week. In parallel to the loading with the high cholesterol diet, a vehicle (0.5% MC), or compound A and/or ezetimibe was orally administered once a day. In the afternoon of the last day of the administration, blood was collected under pentobarbital anesthesia after the fasting period of 4 hours, and the TG levels and TC levels in the plasma, and lipid levels in the lipoprotein (VLDL-C, LDL-C and HLDL-C) were measured. The synergistic effect was determined by using Bürgi's formula (in a case where a level lower than that in the control group is indicated in a drug administration group, that is, when the evaluation of an agent to the TC, VLDL-C, or LDL-C is performed, if the relative level in the combined group is smaller than the value of the product of the relative level of single agent A and the relative level of single agent Β, the synergistic effect exists. In a case where a level higher than that in the control group is indicated in a drug administration group, that is, when the evaluation of an agent to the HDL-C is performed, if the relative level in the combined group is larger than the value of the product of the relative level of single agent A and the relative level of single agent Β, the synergistic effect exists). 2.

[0051] Synergistic effects by the combination of compound A with ezetimibe on the high-cholesterol diet-fed rats [0052] [Table 2] Compound A (mg/kg) Ezetimibe (mg/kg) 0.1 0.01 0.1 0.01 0.1 0.1 0.1 TC Relative Level (to Control) 0.956 0.898 0.635 0.555 0.462 Bürgi’s Formula 0.859 0.530 VLDL-C Relative Level (to Control) 0.827 0.719 0.374 0.262 0.179 Bürgi’s Formula 0.595 0.217 LDL-C Relative Level (to Control) 0.971 0.955 0.713 0.720 0.529 Bürgi’s Formula 0.927 0.698 HDL-C Relative Level (to Control) 1.021 0.910 1.204 1.100 1.326 Bürgi’s Formula 0.929 1.123 [0053] As to each numerical value, the value in the upper shows a relative level to the control group, and the value in the lower shows the product of the relative levels in the compound A single administration group and the ezetimibe single administration group by using Bürgi's formula. The values in the underlined part show that the synergistic effect is recognized. [0054] Firstly, when the attention was focused on TC (Table 2 and FIG. 2), the relative level of the compound A single administration group was 0.956, the relative level of the 0.01 mg/kg single administration group of ezetimibe was 0.898, and the product of both relative levels was 0.859. On the other hand, the relative level of the combined administration group of compound A and 0.01 mg/kg of ezetimibe was 0.635, and was significantly decreased as compared with the product of levels in the single administration groups, therefore, the synergistic TC lowering effect was confirmed. Further, the relative level of 0.1 mg/kg single administration group of ezetimibe was 0.555, and the product of the relative level 0.555 and the relative level 0.956 of the compound A administration group was 0.530, whereas the relative level of 0.1 mg/kg combined administration group of the compound A and the ezetimibe was 0.462, therefore, it was revealed that the synergistic TC lowering effect was recognized also in the high-dose group of ezetimibe. In the same manner, by the combined administration of the compound A and the ezetimibe, the synergistic lowering effect for the VLDL-C level and LDL-C level, and the synergistic increasing effect for the HDL-C level were recognized. Comparative Example Combined effect of fenofibrate and ezetimibe on high-cholesterol diet-fed rats 1. Procedure SD rats (6 weeks old, male, CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES JAPAN, INC.) were used in the experiments. Blood was collected from the jugular vein of chow-fed rat, and divided into 4 groups (Ν = 8) base on the levels of TG and TC in the plasma, and the body weight. From the next day, a solid chow containing 2℅ cholesterol and 0.5℅ sodium cholate (MF-based, Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd.) was loaded to rats for one week. In parallel to the loading with the high cholesterol diet, a vehicle (0.5% MC), or fenofibrate (FF) and/or ezetimibe (Ezeti) was orally administered once a day. In the afternoon of the last day of the administration, blood was collected under pentobarbital anesthesia after the fasting period of 4 hours . The HDL-C levels in the plasma were measured. 2. Group Configuration Group 1 : Control Group 2: Fenofibrate 10 mg/kg Group 3: Ezetimibe 0.1 mg/kg Group 4 : Combination of fenofibrate 10 mg/kg and ezetimibe 0.1 mg/kg 3. Statistical Analysis and Data Processing Method The results were shown as the average level ± standard deviation. Comparison between the control group and the drug administration group was performed using Dunnett's multiple comparison test, and the risk rate of less than 5% was determined to have a significant difference. 4. Results The results are shown in FIG. 6. Fenofibrate has also been known as a PPARa agonist, however, the synergistic increasing effect for the HDL-C level was not recognized in the combination of fenofibrate with ezetimibe.
