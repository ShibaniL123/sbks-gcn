No. A1-165: 1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-N-[1-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]methanesulfonamide
Ethyl (2E)-3-(2-fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)acrylate (12.50 g, 52.51 mmol) and 1-methylcyclopropylamine hydrochloride (22.59 g, 210.03 mmol) were dissolved under argon in abs. N,N-dimethylacetamide (50 mL), and then N,N-diisopropylethylamine (250 mL) was added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at a temperature of 90° C. for 8 h and, after cooling to room temperature, water and dichloromethane were added. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), ethyl (2E)-3-{2-[(1-methylcyclopropyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}acrylate (13.97 g, 87% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid, 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 8.28 (m, 1H), 8.16 (m, 1H), 7.62 (d, 1H), 7.07 (d, 1H), 6.45 (d, 1H), 5.18 (br. d, 1H, NH), 4.29 (q, 2H), 1.58 (s, 3H), 1.37 (t, 3H), 0.89 (m, 2H), 0.83 (m, 2H). Ethyl (2E)-3-{2-[(1-methylcyclopropyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}acrylate (4070 mg, 14.02 mmol) was then dissolved in abs. ethanol (75 mL), and (Ph3P)3RhCl (1297 mg, 1.40 mmol) was added. After stirring at room temperature for 5 min, hydrogen was introduced into the reaction solution with a constant gas flow via a gas introduction apparatus for 9 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by LCMS. On completion of conversion, the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), it was possible to isolate ethyl 3-{2-[(1-methylcyclopropyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}propanoate (1460 mg, 35% of theory) as a colorless solid. Ethyl 3-{2-[(1-methylcyclopropyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}propanoate (1460 mg, 4.99 mmol) was dissolved in abs. tetrahydrofuran (26 mL) and added dropwise to a suspension, cooled down to 0° C., of sodium hydride (300 mg, 7.49 mmol, 60% suspension in oil) in abs. tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) under argon. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 4 h, and then water was added cautiously, followed by dichloromethane after stirring for 5 min. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 1-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-6-nitro-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (550 mg, 42%) was isolated as a colorless solid, 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 8.18 (m, 1H), 8.04 (m, 1H), 7.43 (d, 1H), 2.97-2.83 (m, 2H), 2.77-2.73 (m, 1H), 2.62-2.53 (m, 1H), 1.58 (s, 3H), 1.21-1.17 (m, 1H), 1.11-1.07 (m, 1H), 0.92-0.87 (m, 1H), 0.65-0.58 (m, 1H). In the next step, 1-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-6-nitro-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (300 mg, 1.22 mmol) was added together with tin(II) chloride dihydrate (1100 mg, 4.87 mmol) to abs. ethanol (10 mmol) and the mixture was stirred under argon at a temperature of 60° C. for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into ice-water and then adjusted to pH 12 using aqueous NaOH. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 6-amino-1-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (250 mg, 95% of theory) was isolated as a highly viscous foam, 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 7.12 (d, 1H), 6.59 (m, 1H), 6.49 (m, 1H), 3.54 (br. s, 2H, NH), 2.82-2.75 (m, 1H), 2.64-2.58 (m, 2H), 2.58-2.47 (m, 1H), 1.52 (s, 3H), 1.12-1.08 (m, 1H), 1.06-1.02 (m, 1H), 0.79-0.76 (m, 1H), 0.65-0.51 (m, 1H). 6-Amino-1-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (250 mg, 1.16 mmol) was dissolved together with (4-chlorophenyl)methanesulfonyl chloride (286 mg, 1.27 mmol) in abs. acetonitrile (10 mL) in a baked-out round-bottom flask under argon, then pyridine (0.28 mL, 3.47 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at 70° C. for 4 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure, the remaining residue was admixed with dil. HCl and dichloromethane, and the aqueous phase was extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-[1-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]methanesulfonamide (261 mg, 55% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid.
