TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to aerosol inhaling devices. BACKGROUND ART Although smoking may cause serious respiratory diseases and cancer, it remains extremely difficult for smokers to quit smoking completely. The active ingredient in a cigarette is nicotine. During smoking, nicotine, along with tar aerosol droplets, enter the smoker's alveolus and are widely absorbed. The nicotine then affects the receptors of the smoker's central nervous system. Nicotine is a kind of alkaloid with low molecular weight. A small dose of nicotine is essentially harmless to human body and its half-life in blood quite short. The major harmful substance in tobacco is tar. Tar in tobacco is composed of thousands of ingredients. Several of these are cancerogenic. What is needed, therefore, is a cigarette substitute, which can overcome the above shortcomings. SUMMARY An exemplary aerosol inhaling device includes a liquid supply, an atomizing device, and a power supply. The liquid supply is configured for storing tobacco liquid. The atomizing device configured for heating the tobacco liquid to form aerosol. The power supply is electrically connected with the atomizing device. The power supply is configured for supplying the atomizing device power.
