BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. (Cancer Facts and Figures 2004, American Cancer Society, Inc.) Despite recent advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment, surgery and radiotherapy may be curative if a cancer is found early, but current drug therapies for metastatic disease are mostly palliative and seldom offer a long-term cure. Even with new chemotherapies entering the market, the need continues for new drugs effective in monotherapy or in combination with existing agents as first line therapy, and as second and third line therapies in treatment of resistant tumors. Cancer cells are by definition heterogeneous. For example, within a single tissue or cell type, multiple mutational ‘mechanisms’ may lead to the development of cancer. As such, heterogeneity frequently exists between cancer cells taken from tumors of the same tissue and same type that have originated in different individuals. Frequently observed mutational ‘mechanisms’ associated with some cancers may differ between one tissue type and another (e.g., frequently observed mutational ‘mechanisms’ leading to colon cancer may differ from frequently observed ‘mechanisms’ leading to leukemias). It is therefore often difficult to predict whether a particular cancer will respond to a particular chemotherapeutic agent. (Cancer Medicine, 5th Edition, Bast et al. eds., B.C. Decker Inc., Hamilton, Ontario) Components of cellular signal transduction pathways that regulate the growth and differentiation of normal cells can, when dysregulated, lead to the development of cellular proliferative disorders and cancer. Mutations in cellular signaling proteins may cause such proteins to become expressed or activated at inappropriate levels or at inappropriate times during the cell cycle, which in turn may lead to uncontrolled cellular growth or changes in cellcell attachment properties. For example, dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by mutation, gene rearrangement, gene amplification, and overexpression of both receptor and ligand has been implicated in the development and progression of human cancers. The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase is the only known high-affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor. Binding of HGF to the c-Met extracellular ligand-binding domain results in receptor multimerization and phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in the intracellular portion of c-Met. Activation of c-Met results in the binding and phosphorylation of adaptor proteins such as Gab-1, Grb-2, She, and c-Cbl, and subsequent activation of signal transducers such as PI3K, PLC-y, STATs, ERK1 and 2 and FAK. c-Met and HGF are expressed in numerous tissues, and their expression is normally confined predominantly to cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin, respectively. c-Met and HGF are dysregulated in human cancers and may contribute to dysregulation of cell growth, tumor cell dissemination, and tumor invasion during disease progression and metastasis (See, e.g., Journal of Clinical Investigation 109: 863-867 (2002) and Cancer Cell ρρ 5-6 July 2004). c-Met and HGF are highly expressed relative to surrounding tissue in numerous cancers, and their expression correlates with poor prognosis and lack of response to standard clinical treatments. (See, e.g., Journal of Cellular Biochemistry 86: 665-677 (2002); Int. J. Cancer (Pred. Oncol.) 74: 301-309 (1997); Clinical Cancer Research 9: 1480-1488 (2003); and Cancer Research 62: 589-596 (2002)). Without intending to be bound by theory, c-Met and HGF may protect tumors against cell death induced by DNA-damaging agents and, as such, may contribute to chemoresistance and radioresistance of tumors. Without intending to be limited by any theory, inhibitors of c-Met may be useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of proliferative disorders including breast cancer. (See, e.g., Cancer and Metastasis Reviews 22: 309-325 (2003)). Accordingly, new compounds and methods for modulating these factors and treating cancer are needed. The present invention addresses these needs.

All forms of the compounds of the instant invention are contemplated, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form, including crystalline forms of racemic mixtures and crystalline forms of individual isomers. The invention very particularly embraces isolated optical isomers having a specified activity. The racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods, such as, for example, separation or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives, separation by chiral column chromatography or supercritical fluid chromatography. The individual optical isomers can be obtained from the racemates by conventional methods, such as, for example, salt formation with an optically active acid or base followed by crystallization. Certain compounds of this invention may exist in tautomeric forms. All such tautomeric forms of the compounds are considered to be within the scope of this invention unless otherwise stated. In addition, a crystal polymorphism may be present but is not limiting, but any crystal form may be single or a crystal form mixture, or an anhydrous or hydrated crystal form. The terms “crystal polymorphs” or “polymorphs” or “crystal forms” means crystal structures in which a compound (or salt or solvate thereof) can crystallize in different crystal packing arrangements, all of which have the same elemental composition. Different crystal forms usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability and solubility. Crystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. Crystal polymorphs of the compounds can be prepared by crystallization under different conditions.

Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate, when the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one of the substances in which the water retains its molecular state as Η2Ο, such combination being able to form one or more hydrate. For example, the solvate may be a dichloromethane (DCM) solvate. The present invention also provides a (±)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 17/-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione dichloromethane and a composition comprising (±)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione dichloromethane. The composition can comprise greater than 90%, greater than 95% or greater than 99% (±)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 17/-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione dichloromethane. The composition can comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. Some compounds of the present invention can exist in a tautomeric form which are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. “Tautomers” refers to compounds whose structures differ markedly in arrangement of atoms, but which exist in easy and rapid equilibrium. It is to be understood that the compounds of the invention may be depicted as different tautomers. It should also be understood that when compounds have tautomeric forms, all tautomeric forms are intended to be within the scope of the invention, and the naming of the compounds does not exclude any tautomeric form. The compounds, salts and prodrugs of the present invention can exist in several tautomeric forms, and such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the present invention. Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in solution. In solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. Even though one tautomer may be described, the present invention includes all tautomers of the present compounds As used herein, the term “salt” is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and can include acid addition salts including hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulphates, hydrogen sulphates, alkylsulphonates, arylsulphonates, acetates, benzoates, citrates, maleates, fumarates, succinates, lactates, and tartrates; alkali metal cations such as Na+, K+, Li+, alkali earth metal salts such as Mg2+ or Ca2+, or organic amine salts. As used herein, the term “metabolite” means a product of metabolism of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, polymorph or solvate thereof, that exhibits a similar activity in vivo to said compound of the present invention. As used herein, the term “mixing” means combining, blending, stirring, shaking, swirling or agitating. The term “stirring” means mixing, shaking, agitating, or swirling. The term “agitating” means mixing, shaking, stirring, or swirling. The compounds of the present invention can also be prepared as prodrugs, for example pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs. The terms “pro-drug” and “prodrug” are used interchangeably herein and refer to any compound which releases an active parent drug in vivo. Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals (e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc.) the compounds of the present invention can be delivered in prodrug form. Thus, the present invention is intended to cover prodrugs of the presently claimed compounds, methods of delivering the same and compositions containing the same. The term “prodrug” includes a compound of the present invention covalently linked to one or more pro-moieties, such as an amino acid moiety or other water- solubilizing moiety. A compound of the present invention may be released from the pro-moiety via hydrolytic, oxidative, and/or enzymatic release mechanisms. In an embodiment, a prodrug composition of the present invention exhibits the added benefit of increased aqueous solubility, improved stability, and improved pharmacokinetic profiles. The pro-moiety may be selected to obtain desired prodrug characteristics. For example, the pro-moiety, e.g., an amino acid moiety or other water solubilizing moiety such as phosphate may be selected based on solubility, stability, bioavailability, and/or in vivo delivery or uptake. The term “prodrug” is also intended to include any covalently bonded carriers that release an active parent drug of the present invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Prodrugs in the present invention are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of the present invention wherein a hydroxy, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy, or carbonyl group is bonded to any group that, may be cleaved in vivo to form a free hydroxyl, free amino, free sulfhydryl, free carboxy or free carbonyl group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, esters (e.g., acetate, dialkylaminoacetates, formates, phosphates, sulfates, and benzoate derivatives) and carbamates (e.g., N,N-dimethylaminocarbonyl) of hydroxy functional groups, esters groups (e.g. ethyl esters, morpholinoethanol esters) of carboxyl functional groups, N-acyl derivatives (e.g. N-acetyl) N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases and enaminones of amino functional groups, oximes, acetals, ketals and enol esters of ketone and aldehyde functional groups in compounds of Formula I, and the like, See Bundegaard, Η.

Preferably, the produced {-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione comprises less than 1%, less than 0.7%, less than 0.5% or less than 0.1% (+)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione.

Scheme I provides a summary for the production of the instant compositions comprising highly purified (> 99% chiral purity) (-)-tnmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 //-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione, with minimal amounts (< 1%) of the undesired enantiomer, (+)-mmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1-yl)-4-(1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione, present. Preferably, the compositions comprise (-)mms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione having a chiral purity greater than 99.3%, greater than 99.5%, greater than 99.6%, greater than 99.7%, greater than 99.8% or greater than 99.9%. Preferably, the compositions comprise less than 0.7%, less than 0.5%, less than 0.4%, less than 0.3%, less than 0.2% or less than 0.1% (+)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione. As shown in scheme I and described in detail in the following examples, various procedures are utilized to produce and isolate these compositions comprising highly chirally pure (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1-yl)-4-(17f-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione, including but not limited to, multicolumn chromatography resolution, diastereomeric salt resolution or dynamic kinetic resolution. In step 1 of scheme I, lilolidine (Compound 4), was treated with oxalylchloride to give the acyl chloride in methyl tert-butyl ether (ΜΤΒΕ) reaction solvent. The addition of methanol was sufficient to afford the intermediate ketoester, 5, 6-dihydro-47/-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1-yl) oxoacetic acid methyl ester (Compound 5). In Step 2 of the reaction, Compound 5 and indole-3-acetamide (Compound 5a) were combined to produce 3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrole-2, 5-dione (Compound 6). As described in detail in the following examples, it is not necessary to isolate intermediate Compound 5 to produce Compound 6. A solvent swap from ΜΤΒΕ into tetrahydrofuran (THF) was necessary prior to conducting Step 2, since both 5 and 5a have very poor solubility in ΜΤΒΕ. Following the addition of Compound 5a to consume Compound 5 in THF in the presence of base, HC1 was added to complete the reaction to afford crude Compound 6. Crude Compound 6 was then purified from DCM and heptane to afford Compound 6 of sufficient purity to proceed to the next step. A detailed description of this process is shown in Example 1. Compound 6 was hydrogenated with palladium hydroxide, THF, and potassium tertbutoxide to produce crude trans racemate, (±)-mmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 8). As described in the examples, the preparation of Compound 8, does not require the isolation of crude cis racemate (±)-c/.v-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 7). Rather, during the hydrogenation of Compound 6, conditions were modified to effect the isomerization of the resultant Compound 7in situ. The resulting process provides a means to control key impurities in Compound 8, specifically Compound 6. Specifically, the reaction is carried out in THF solvent, and the catalyst employed is palladium hydroxide. Potassium fc/t-butoxidc is also added to the reaction mixture to promote the isomerization. A detailed description of this process is shown in Example 2. The most common impurity in Compound 8 is typically Compound 7. Since Compound 7 is itself chiral, it is particularly difficult to predict the elution of isomers of Compound 7 from Multicolumn Chromatography (MCC) when lower purity (< 99%) Compound 8 is utilized. In order to ensure high purity product, it is, therefore, necessary to increase the purity of the racemate, Compound 8, prior to enantiomeric resolution by MCC. It was determined that the purity of Compound 8 could be improved through selective crystallization of solvates from various solvents. One such solvate formed from dichloromethane (DCM) yields Compound 8 DCM with very high chemical purity (> 99%). As shown in scheme I, the Compound 8 DCM was formed by dissolving the crude Compound 8 in DCM and then seeding with DCM crystals. After growing the seed bed to a critical mass, heptane was added to drive the crystallization to completion. After isolation by filtration and removal of bulk residual solvent under vacuum, Compound 8 DCM typically contained 0.8-0.9 moles of DCM with respect to Compound 8. This solvate crystallization removes the process impurities present in crude (95-98%) Compound 8 as a result of the hydrogenation and isomerization. A detailed description of this process is shown in Example 3. The present invention provides the chiral resolution of the two enantiomers of Compound 8 DCM by MCC, as shown in Scheme I. The MCC enantiomeric separation process provides an advantage over separation by HPLC batch chromatography in that it can provide high chiral purity (> 99 %) on larger scale (> 20 kg) than batch preparation. MCC resolution can be carried out in either methanol, a mixture of methanol and ethanol (1:1 vol) or methanol and acetonitrile (9:1 ν/ν). The chiral stationary phase (CSP) utilized is either Chiralpak AD or ΑΖ purchased from Chiral Technologies, Inc. The concentration of the racemate feed solution is in the range of 20-50 g/L. Preferably, the specified chiral purity for the separation is > 99% of (-)-tnms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(l/f-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 10) and containing < 1% of (+)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 9). Specifically, separations are carried out by preparing a feed solution of racemic Compound 8 in the chosen mobile phase. This solution is prepared from Compound 8 DCM by initially dissolving the material in methanol. The chromatographic parameters were estimated prior to production, and final optimization was conducted during the initial hours or days of separation of the feed solution. Where initial fractions collected did not meet the chiral purity specification, the material was recycled into the feed solution to repeat the resolution. Once the operating parameters to meet specifications had been established, the conditions were applied to separate the entire volume of feed solution. Throughout the operation, Compound 10 was collected as the raffinate stream, pooled, and concentrated. The concentrated raffinate was then either concentrated to dryness (< 5 kg scale) or concentrated and seeded to induce crystallization of Compound 10 (> 5 kg scale). A detailed description of this process is shown in Example 4. In addition to MCC resolution, a classical approach for the resolution of chiral acids or bases through the formation of diastereomeric salts has been employed. In the case of Compound 10, either acids or bases could be used, since the molecule is amphoteric. Following a detailed screen of chiral bases, it was shown that the salts formed from the enatiomers of Compound 8 with pseudoephedrine have vastly different solubility profiles in some solvents. This relationship was optimized to allow for the resolution of Compound 8 using (lS,2S)-(+)-pscudocphcdrinc to afford (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dionc-(lS,2S)-(+)-pscudocphcdrinc (Compound 10·(1Α,25)-(+)-ρ8℮ηΰο℮ρ1ΐ℮ΰπη℮) selectively. A detailed description of this process is shown in Example 6. Another process provided by the instant invention is to racemize the undesired enantiomer, (+)-mms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 9),in situ using Dynamic Kinetic Resolution (DKR). A detailed description of this process is shown in Example 7. In both the MCC resolution and classical diastereomeric salt resolution process, the undesired enantiomer, Compound 9, is isolated. This undesired enantiomer can be isomerized to obtain racemic Compound 8. This is accomplished by implementing the same procedure for isomerizing the c/.v-isomcr, Compound 7, to afford crude trans racemate Compound 8. The isomerization is carried out in either methanol or ethanol using sodium hydroxide as a base. A detailed description of this process is shown in Example 5. The synthesis methods described in Scheme I are readily reproducible on a large scale, e.g., 10 kg, 20 kg, 30 kg, 40 kg, 50 kg, and 60 kg and higher providing an overall yield of > 45 % of (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 10), based on indole acetamide as a limiting reagent. Preferably, 1 kg of lilolidine (Compound 4) yields approximately 1 kg of {-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 10) having a purity > 99%. The present invention also provides a method to prepare polymorphs of {-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidinc-2, 5-dione. The crude Compound 10 was dissolved in a solvent, for example, THF, by heating the resulting mixture to 50 °C. The resulting mixture was polish filtered, followed by the addition of a second solvent, such as methanol, and a Form 1 seed crystal of Compound 10. The use of seed crystals imparts polymorphic control of the crystallization process. In the absence of seeding, either Form 1 or Form 2 can be spontaneously crystallized in high purity. Thus, to provide Form 1 or Form 2 seeds, spontaneous crystallization is permitted; and once formed, the crystalline product can be characterized using quantitative analysis by x-ray powder diffraction to determine the resulting crystal form and its polymorphic purity. Following such characterization, this crystalline product can be used as “seed crystals” or “seeds” to control the polymorph, either Form 1 or Form 2, generated during the subsequent crystallizations as described herein. The solution was then concentrated azeotropically and atmospherically by distillation to reduce the volume of the solvent, e.g., THF. The temperature of the solution was reduced to 50 °C and stirred for at least 4 hours. Aliquots were removed to confirm to formation of the desired polymorph. If required, the polymorph can be redissolved in THF (30% of batch volume), polish filtered, concentrated and seeded to obtain the desired polymorphic outcome. When the desired polymorphic form was obtained, a solution of 50 % aqueous methanol was added at 50 °C and the solution was agitated for an additional 2-3 hours. The solution was then cooled to ambient temperature and held for at least 2 hours to allow crystallization. Upon completion, the crystals were isolated by filtration, washed with additional 50 % aqueous methanol, and dried under vacuum at 65 °C for at least 12 hours. Polymorphic Form 1 of Compound 10 was isolated as a red-brown solid. Form 2 polymorph of (-)-tnmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(l/f-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione can also be prepared with the above method if the Form 1 seed crystal is replaced by the Form 2 seed crystal.

Administering a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, to a cell or a subject in need thereof can result in modulation (i.e., stimulation or inhibition) of an activity of a kinase of interest. The present invention provides methods to assess biological activity of a composition comprising (a) f-)-tnmv-3-f5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione having a chiral purity greater than 99% as determined by HPLC and containing less than containing less than 1% (+)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione; (b) a form 1 polymorph of (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2,5-dione characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern comprising peaks at approximately 8.2, 10.8 and 14.1 °20 using Cu Κα radiation; or (c) a form 2 polymorph of {-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2,5-dione characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern comprising peaks at approximately 6.5, 9.9 and 12.0 °20 using Cu Κα radiation. In one method, an assay based on enzymatic activity can be utilized. In one specific enzymatic activity assay, the enzymatic activity is from a kinase. As used herein, “kinase” refers to a large class of enzymes which catalyze the transfer of the y-phosphatc from ATP to the hydroxyl group on the side chain of Ser/Thr or Tyr in proteins and peptides and are intimately involved in the control of various important cell functions, perhaps most notably: signal transduction, differentiation, and proliferation. There are estimated to be about 2,000 distinct protein kinases in the human body, and although each of these phosphorylate particular protein/peptide substrates, they all bind the same second substrate ATP in a highly conserved pocket. About 50% of the known oncogene products are protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), and their kinase activity has been shown to lead to cell formation. Preferably, the kinase assayed is a tyrosine kinase. A change in enzymatic activity caused by compounds of the present invention can be measured in the disclosed assays. The change in enzymatic activity can be characterized by the change in the extent of phosphorylation of certain substrates. As used herein, “phosphorylation” refers to the addition of phosphate groups to a substrate, including proteins and organic molecules; and, plays an important role in regulating the biological activities of proteins. Preferably, the phosphorylation assayed and measured involves the addition of phosphate groups to tyrosine residues. The substrate can be a peptide or protein. In some assays, immunological reagents, e.g., antibodies and antigens, are employed. Fluorescence can be utilized in the measurement of enzymatic activity in some assays. As used herein, “fluorescence” refers to a process through which a molecule emits a photon as a result of absorbing an incoming photon of higher energy by the same molecule. Administering a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, to a cell or a subject in need thereof can result in modulation (i.e., stimulation or inhibition) of an activity of c-Met. As used herein, an activity of c-Met refers to any biological function or activity that is carried out by c-Met. For example, a function of c-Met includes phosphorylation of downstream target proteins. Other functions of c-Met include autophosphorylation, binding of adaptor proteins such as Gab-1, Grb-2, She, SHP2 and c-Cbl, and activation of signal transducers such as Ras, Sre, PI3K, PLC-y, STATs, ERK1 and 2 and FAK. Administering a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, to a cell or a subject in need thereof can result in modulation (ΐ.℮., stimulation or inhibition) of an activity of ERK 1 or ERK 2, or both. As used herein, an activity of ERK 1 or ERK 2 refers to any biological function or activity that is carried out by ERK 1 or ERK 2. For example, a function of ERK 1 or ERK 2 includes phosphorylation of downstream target proteins. Activating refers to placing a composition of matter (e.g., protein or nucleic acid) in a state suitable for carrying out a desired biological function. A composition of matter capable of being activated also has an unactivated state. An activated composition of matter may have an inhibitory or stimulatory biological function, or both. Elevation refers to an increase in a desired biological activity of a composition of matter (e.g., a protein or a nucleic acid). Elevation may occur through an increase in concentration of a composition of matter. As used herein, “a cell cycle checkpoint pathway” refers to a biochemical pathway that is involved in modulation of a cell cycle checkpoint. A cell cycle checkpoint pathway may have stimulatory or inhibitory effects, or both, on one or more functions comprising a cell cycle checkpoint. A cell cycle checkpoint pathway is comprised of at least two compositions of matter, preferably proteins, both of which contribute to modulation of a cell cycle checkpoint. A cell cycle checkpoint pathway may be activated through an activation of one or more members of the cell cycle checkpoint pathway. Preferably, a cell cycle checkpoint pathway is a biochemical signaling pathway. As used herein, “cell cycle checkpoint regulator” refers to a composition of matter that can function, at least in part, in modulation of a cell cycle checkpoint. A cell cycle checkpoint regulator may have stimulatory or inhibitory effects, or both, on one or more functions comprising a cell cycle checkpoint. A cell cycle checkpoint regulator can be a protein or not a protein. Treating cancer or a cell proliferative disorder can result in cell death, and preferably, cell death results in a decrease of at least 10% in number of cells in a population. More preferably, cell death means a decrease of at least 20%; more preferably, a decrease of at least 30%; more preferably, a decrease of at least 40%; more preferably, a decrease of at least 50%; most preferably, a decrease of at least 75%. Number of cells in a population may be measured by any reproducible means. A number of cells in a population can be measured by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), immunofluorescence microscopy and light microscopy. Methods of measuring cell death are as shown in Li et αℓ., (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 100(5): 2674-8. In an aspect, cell death occurs by apoptosis. Preferably, an effective amount of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof is not significantly cytotoxic to normal cells. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound is not significantly cytotoxic to normal cells if administration of the compound in a therapeutically effective amount does not induce cell death in greater than 10% of normal cells. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound does not significantly affect the viability of normal cells if administration of the compound in a therapeutically effective amount does not induce cell death in greater than 10% of normal cells. In an aspect, cell death occurs by apoptosis. Contacting a cell with a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, can induce or activate cell death selectively in cancer cells. Administering to a subject in need thereof a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, can induce or activate cell death selectively in cancer cells. Contacting a cell with a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, can induce cell death selectively in one or more cells affected by a cell proliferative disorder. Preferably, administering to a subject in need thereof a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, induces cell death selectively in one or more cells affected by a cell proliferative disorder. The present invention relates to a method of treating or preventing cancer by administering a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof to a subject in need thereof, where administration of the compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof results in one or more of the following: accumulation of cells in G1 and/or S phase of the cell cycle, cytotoxicity via cell death in cancer cells without a significant amount of cell death in normal cells, antitumor activity in animals with a therapeutic index of at least 2, and activation of a cell cycle checkpoint. As used herein, “therapeutic index” is the maximum tolerated dose divided by the efficacious dose. One skilled in the art may refer to general reference texts for detailed descriptions of known techniques discussed herein or equivalent techniques. These texts include Ausubel et αℓ., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. (2005); Sambrook et αℓ., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (3d ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York (2000); Coligan et αℓ., Current Protocols in Immunology, John Wiley & Sons, Ν.Υ.; Enna et αℓ., Current Protocols in Pharmacology, John Wiley & Sons, Ν.Υ.; Fingl et αℓ., The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (1975), Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 18th edition (1990). These texts can, of course, also be referred to in making or using an aspect of the invention As used herein, “combination therapy” or “co-therapy” includes the administration of a compound of the present invention and at least a second agent as part of a specific treatment regimen intended to provide the beneficial effect from the co-action of these therapeutic agents. The beneficial effect of the combination includes, but is not limited to, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic co-action resulting from the combination of therapeutic agents. Administration of these therapeutic agents in combination typically is carried out over a defined time period (usually minutes, hours, days or weeks depending upon the combination selected). “Combination therapy” may be, but generally is not, intended to encompass the administration of two or more of these therapeutic agents as part of separate monotherapy regimens that incidentally and arbitrarily result in the combinations of the present invention. “Combination therapy” is intended to embrace administration of these therapeutic agents in a sequential manner, wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time, as well as administration of these therapeutic agents, or at least two of the therapeutic agents, in a substantially simultaneous manner. Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the subject a single capsule having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple, single capsules for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection. The sequence in which the therapeutic agents are administered is not narrowly critical. “Combination therapy” also embraces the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients and non-drug therapies (e.g., surgery or radiation treatment). Where the combination therapy further comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and non-drug treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.

A “pharmaceutical composition” is a formulation containing the compounds of the present invention in a form suitable for administration to a subject. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in bulk or in unit dosage form. The unit dosage form is any of a variety of forms, including, for example, a capsule, an IV bag, a tablet, a single pump on an aerosol inhaler or a vial. The quantity of active ingredient (e.g., a formulation of the disclosed compound or salt, hydrate, solvate or isomer thereof) in a unit dose of composition is an effective amount and is varied according to the particular treatment involved. One skilled in the art will appreciate that it is sometimes necessary to make routine variations to the dosage depending on the age and condition of the patient. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration. A variety of routes are contemplated, including oral, pulmonary, rectal, parenteral, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, inhalational, buccal, sublingual, intrapleural, intrathecal, intranasal, and the like. Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. In one embodiment, the active compound is mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers or propellants that are required. As used herein, the phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, carriers, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. “Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” means an excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such excipient. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, (e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous), oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), and transmucosal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates, and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. A compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be administered to a subject in many of the well-known methods currently used for chemotherapeutic treatment. For example, for treatment of cancers, a compound of the invention may be injected directly into tumors, injected into the blood stream or body cavities or taken orally or applied through the skin with patches. The dose chosen should be sufficient to constitute effective treatment but not so high as to cause unacceptable side effects. The state of the disease condition (e.g., cancer, precancer, and the like) and the health of the patient should preferably be closely monitored during and for a reasonable period after treatment. The term “therapeutically effective amount,” as used herein, refers to an amount of a pharmaceutical agent to treat, ameliorate, or prevent an identified disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or inhibitory effect. The effect can be detected by any assay method known in the art. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject’s body weight, size, and health; the nature and extent of the condition; and the therapeutic or combination of therapeutics selected for administration. Therapeutically effective amounts for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation that is within the skill and judgment of the clinician. In a preferred aspect, the disease or condition to be treated is cancer. In another aspect, the disease or condition to be treated is a cell proliferative disorder. For any compound, the therapeutically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays, e.g., of neoplastic cells, or in animal models, usually rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans. Therapeutic/prophylactic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, LD50/ED50. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active agent(s) or to maintain the desired effect. Factors which may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, general health of the subject, age, weight, and gender of the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and tolerance/response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered daily, every 3 to 4 days, every week, or once every two weeks depending on half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation. The pharmaceutical compositions containing active compounds of the present invention may be manufactured in a manner that is generally known, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes. Pharmaceutical compositions maybe formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and/or auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically. Of course, the appropriate formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, and/or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch, pregelatinized starch, or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as croscarmellose sodium, sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl starch, alginic acid, Primogel, crospovidone, or com starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or dispenser, which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., hydrofluoroalkanes, chlorofluorocarbons, carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The active compounds can be prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid or mixtures or copolymers of polyesters. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved. In therapeutic applications, the dosages of the pharmaceutical compositions used in accordance with the invention vary depending on the agent, the age, weight, and clinical condition of the recipient patient, and the experience and judgment of the clinician or practitioner administering the therapy, among other factors affecting the selected dosage. Generally, the dose should be sufficient to result in slowing, and preferably regressing, the growth of the tumors and also preferably causing complete regression of the cancer. Dosages can range from about 0.01 mg/kg per day to about 5000 mg/kg per day. In preferred aspects, dosages can range from about 1 mg/kg per day to about 1000 mg/kg per day. In an aspect, the dose will be in the range of about 0.1 mg/day to about 50 g/day; about 0.1 mg/day to about 25 g/day; about 0.1 mg/day to about 10 g/day; about 0.1 mg to about 3g/day; or about 0.1 mg to about 1 g/day, in single, divided, or continuous doses (which dose maybe adjusted for the patient’s weight in kg, body surface area in m2, and age in years). In preferred applications, the dosage can be approximately 400 milligrams twice daily (b.i.d.). In specific applications, the dosage is 360 milligrams (mg) twice daily (b.i.d.). More preferably, dosage form is a capsule or tablet and is administered as two or three capsules or tablets with a combined dosage of 360 milligrams (mg). This dosage form is administered twice daily for a total dose of 720 milligrams (mg). An effective amount of a pharmaceutical agent is that which provides an objectively identifiable improvement as noted by the clinician or other qualified observer. For example, regression of a tumor in a patient may be measured with reference to the diameter of a tumor. Decrease in the diameter of a tumor indicates regression. Regression is also indicated by failure of tumors to recur after treatment has stopped. As used herein, the term “dosage effective manner” refers to amount of an active compound to produce the desired biological effect in a subject or cell. The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. The compounds of the present invention are capable of further forming salts. All of these forms are also contemplated within the scope of the claimed invention. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the compounds of the present invention wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines, alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include, but are not limited to, those derived from inorganic and organic acids selected from 2-acetoxybenzoic, 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic, acetic, ascorbic, benzene sulfonic, benzoic, bicarbonic, carbonic, citric, edetic, ethane disulfonic, 1,2-ethane sulfonic, fumaric, glucoheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, glycollyarsanilic, hexylresorcinic, hydrabamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydroiodic, hydroxymaleic, hydroxynaphthoic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauryl sulfonic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methane sulfonic, napsylic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phosphoric, polygalacturonic, propionic, salicyclic, stearic, subacetic, succinic, sulfamic, sulfanilic, sulfuric, tannic, tartaric, toluene sulfonic, and the commonly occurring amine acids, e.g., glycine, alanine, phenylalanine, arginine, etc. Other examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include hexanoic acid, cyclopentane propionic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo-[2.2.2]-oct-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, muconic acid, and the like. The present invention also encompasses salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, N-methylglucamine, and the like. It should be understood that all references to pharmaceutically acceptable salts include solvent addition forms (solvates) or crystal forms (polymorphs) as defined herein, of the same salt. The compounds of the present invention can also be prepared as esters, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable esters. For example, a carboxylic acid function group in a compound can be converted to its corresponding ester, e.g., a methyl, ethyl or other ester. Also, an alcohol group in a compound can be converted to its corresponding ester, e.g., an acetate, propionate or other ester. The compounds of the present invention can also be prepared as prodrugs, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs. The terms “pro-drug” and “prodrug” are used interchangeably herein and refer to any compound which releases an active parent drug in vivo. Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals (e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc.), the compounds of the present invention can be delivered in prodrug form. Thus, the present invention is intended to cover prodrugs of the presently claimed compounds, methods of delivering the same and compositions containing the same. “Prodrugs” are intended to include any covalently bonded carriers that release an active parent drug of the present invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Prodrugs in the present invention are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of the present invention wherein a hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy or carbonyl group is bonded to any group that, may be cleaved in vivo to form a free hydroxyl, free amino, free sulfhydryl, free carboxy or free carbonyl group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, esters (e.g., acetate, dialkylaminoacetates, hydroxy, phosphates, sulfates and benzoate derivatives) and carbamates (e.g., N,N-dimethylaminocarbonyl) of hydroxyl functional groups, esters (e.g., ethyl esters, morpholinoethanol esters) of carboxyl functional groups, N-acyl derivatives (e.g., N-acetyl) N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases and enaminones of amino functional groups, oximes, acetals, ketals and enol esters of ketone and aldehyde functional groups in compounds of the invention, and the like, See Bundegaard, Η., Design of Prodrugs, pi-92, Elesevier, New York-Oxford (1985). The compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters or prodrugs thereof, are administered orally, nasally, transdermally, pulmonary, inhalationally, buccally, sublingually, intraperintoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously, rectally, intrapleurally, intrathecally and parenterally. In one embodiment, the compound is administered orally. One skilled in the art will recognize the advantages of certain routes of administration. The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound or salt thereof employed. An ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Techniques for formulation and administration of the disclosed compounds of the invention can be found in Remington: the Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th edition, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA (1995). In an embodiment, the compounds described herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are used in pharmaceutical preparations in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include inert solid fillers or diluents and sterile aqueous or organic solutions. The compounds will be present in such pharmaceutical compositions in amounts sufficient to provide the desired dosage amount in the range described herein. All percentages and ratios used herein, unless otherwise indicated, are by weight. Other features and advantages of the present invention are apparent from the different examples. The provided examples illustrate different components and methodology useful in practicing the present invention. The examples do not limit the claimed invention. Based on the present disclosure the skilled artisan can identify and employ other components and methodology useful for practicing the present invention. EXAMPLES Example 1. The present example describes the preparation of 3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrole-2, 5-dione. Lilolidine [CAS 102280-97-7] (70 kg) (Compound 4 in Scheme I) was charged to an appropriately cleaned and dry reactor vessel followed by methyl tert-butyl ether (ΜΤΒΕ) (375 kg). Lilolidine may be purchased commercially or prepared as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0223760. The resulting batch was agitated for a minimum of 10 minutes at 15-25 °C. A solution of oxalyl chloride (56.6 kg) in ΜΤΒΕ (370 kg) was prepared in a separate vessel. The lilolidine solution was then added to the oxalyl chloride solution at such a rate to maintain the temperature below 32 °C. The vessel was rinsed with additional ΜΤΒΕ (162 kg) and added to the reaction mixture. The batch was stirred at 15-32 °C for a minimum of two hours prior to analysis by HPLC. When the reaction was determined to be complete, methanol (90 kg) was added, and the batch was stirred for a minimum of two hours. When the reaction was determined to be complete by HPLC analysis, the batch was distilled to approximately 80 gallons. It is not necessary to isolate the intermediate 5, 6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-l-yl) oxoacetic acid methyl ester (Compound 5 in Scheme I). Tetrahydrofuran (THF) (840 kg) was added to the batch and the volume was again reduced to approximately 80 gallons by distillation. This solvent swap process was continued until the amount of ΜΤΒΕ present in the batch was <1% by weight. A new vessel was charged with indole-3-acetamide [CAS 879-37-8] (61.3 kg) (Compound 5a in Scheme I) followed by THF (840 kg). The resulting solution was then charged to the batch at a rate such that the temperature was maintained at 15-25 °C. The vessel containing the solution of indole-3-acetamide was rinsed with THF (140 kg), and the rinse was added to the batch. The empty vessel was then charged with potassium te/t-butoxidc solution (1.6 Μ in THF, 581 kg) and THF (350 kg). The solution was also added to the batch, and the resulting solution was stirred at 20-32 °C for a minimum of three hours. When the starting material had been consumed as confirmed by HPLC analysis, aqueous HC1 {cone., 273 kg) was added at such a rate that the temperature was maintained below 50 °C. The batch was stirred at 40-50 °C for a minimum of 30 minutes. When the reaction had been determined to be complete by HPLC analysis, aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution {cone.) was added, while maintaining the reaction temperature below 40 °C, until the pH of the mixture was 9-10. Following the addition of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (462 kg) and agitation of the batch, the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with brine (182 kg NaCl and 1022 kg water). The resulting organic solution was distilled to approximately one third of the starting volume. Ethanol (2Β, 1120 kg) was added, and the distillation was continued to reduce the batch volume to approximately 240 gallons. Ethanol (2Β, 1120 kg) was again added, and the volume reduced to 240 gallons. Water (1400 kg) was then added to the batch to induce precipitation of the product. The batch was agitated for a minimum of two hours, and the solids were isolated by filtration. The solids were then taken up in dichloromethane (DCM) (840 kg), and heptanes (442 kg) were added to purify the product. Following agitation of the batch for at least two hours, the product was isolated by filtration. Following conditioning on the filter, approximately 115 kg (88%) of 3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrole-2, 5-dione (Compound 6 in Scheme I) was isolated as a red powder. This conversion of Compound 4 to Compound 6 is shown in Scheme II. Crude Compound 6 90-92 % (FIPLC area) Compound 6 of >95 % purity (FIPLC area) Scheme II Example 2, The present example describes the preparation of (±)-/nmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-zy] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione. Palladium hydroxide (20wt% Pd on carbon, 11.5 kg) was charged to a properly prepared reaction vessel. THF (340 kg) was added to produce a slurry, and the catalyst was prereduced with hydrogen (50-75 psi). Compound 6 (115 kg) was charged to an empty vessel followed by THF (353 kg). The resulting mixture was stirred until dissolution was complete. The solution of Compound 6 was then transferred to the slurry of the catalyst. A solution of potassium te/t-butoxidc (1.6 Μ in THF, 36 kg) was charged to an empty reactor followed by THF (21 kg). This resulting solution was also transferred to the reaction mixture followed by an additional rinse with THF (340 kg). The batch was then heated to 45-55 °C under 65-80 psi of hydrogen. It is not necessary to isolate the intermediate cis racemate (+)c/.v-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 7 in Scheme I). When the reaction was determined to be complete by HPFC analysis, the batch was filtered through Celite to remove the catalyst and diluted with isopropylacetate (z'PrOAc) (810 kg). The organic solution was washed with aqueous HC1 (28 kg cone. HC1, 290 kg water). This process was repeated a second time. The organic solution was then washed with brine (580 kg) prior to being concentrated to approximately 300 gallons by distillation. z'PrOAc (1690 kg) was added, and the batch was distilled to approximately 400 gallons. The distillation process was repeated by adding z'PrOAc (1000 kg) until the THF content was <2% by weight in the solution. Heptanes (2000 kg) were then added to induce precipitation of the product. The crude (±)-/ra/is-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-l-yl)-4-( 1/7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 8 in Scheme I) was isolated by filtration and conditioned to afford 111 kg (95%) having an HPFC purity of ~96%. This material also contained 1.7% z'PrOAc and 6.3% heptane. This material was confirmed through laboratory scale “use” testing to be of sufficient purity to proceed with preparation of the (±)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione dichloromethane (DCM) and resolution by multicolumn chromatography (MCC) or for direct use in crystallization of the diastereomeric salt, as described in further detail in the following examples. Example 3. The present example describes preparation of (±)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-z/] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione DCM. It is preferred to chemically purify Compound 8 by production of crystalline (+)mms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione DCM (Compound 8 DCM in Scheme I) prior to the process of enantiomeric resolution by MCC. In one example, the reaction vessel was charged with methanol (125 kg) and Compound 8 (52.5 kg) and the resulting mixture was heated to 55-65 °C. DCM (557 kg) was charged to a clean reactor. The solution of Compound 8 was then transferred to the reactor containing DCM through an inline filter. The reactor was rinsed with DCM (134 kg) which was also transferred through the filter to the reactor containing the reaction mixture. The batch was agitated for a minimum of 30 minutes prior to the introduction of Compound 8 DCM seeds (0.1 kg). The batch was stirred for at least four hours and then sampled to estimate the extent of crystallization. When the filtrate concentration of Compound 8 was below 65 mg/mL, heptanes (718 kg) were added and the batch was stirred for at least one hour. The batch was then cooled to 0-5 °C, and the product was isolated by filtration. The solids were conditioned on the filter and dried in a vacuum tray drier at 45-55 °C for at least four hours. Compound 8 DCM (48.3 kg, 92%, HPLC 99.0%) was isolated as a tan solid. The conversion of Compound 6 to Compound 8 DCM described in examples 2 and 3 are shown in Scheme III. Η Compound 6 Crude Compound 8 95-97% (HPLC area) trans racemate >99 % (HPLC area) Compound 8 DCMtrans racemate Example 4, The present example describes the chiral resolution of (±)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4Hpyrrolo [3,2,1 -ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione DCM by MCC and isolation of (-)-tnms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione. A feed solution for multicolumn chromatography (MCC) is prepared by dissolving Compound 8 DCM in methanol. The resulting DCM/methanol co-solvent is distilled until the residual level of DCM in the feed solution reaches a level acceptable for contact with the Chiral Stationary Phase (CSP), i.e., < 0.1% by weight. The batch is diluted in a mixture of methanol/Acetonitrile (9:1) to a concentration of 50 mg/mL and introduced to the chromatographic system. Chiralpak ΑΖ (CSP) can be utilized. The raffinate is monitored by chiral HPLC analysis and chromatographic parameters are tuned to obtain >99% chiral purity of (-)-tnmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 10 in Scheme I). Raffinate is pooled and concentrated batchwise as the separation proceeds. The collected raffinate is taken to a larger reactor and the volume is reduced. Compound 10 is then isolated by crystallization. Example 5. The present example describes batchwise generation of {-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/fpyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione from the undesired enantiomer, (+)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione. In some instances, for instance when resolution is achieved using MCC, it is desirable to isolate and racemize the undesired enantiomer, (+)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (Compound 9 in Scheme I), in a batchwise manner. In one example of the process to generate crude Compound 8 from isolated Compound 9, the undesired enantiomer (6.46 kg) was charged to a 100-L reactor. Ethanol (60 L) was charged followed by the addition of solid NaOH (1.05 kg, 1.5 equiv). The resulting slurry was heated to 65 °C for 13 hours and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature over 4 hours. The mixture was sampled and analyzed by chiral HPLC showing a 54/46 ratio of enantiomers. The chemical purity was determined to be 94.6% (AUC) by HPLC. The slurry was then polish filtered through Celite, and the pad was rinsed with ethanol (13 L). The material that was removed was a brown film of solids with no large chunks. The solution was then recharged to the 100-L reactor and 2 Μ HC1 (13.1 L, 1.5 equiv) was added over 35 minutes. During the addition, a thin slurry formed. The mixture was then stirred at ambient temperature (after 5 hours a thick light orange slurry was obtained). Water (25 L) was then added over 45 minutes, and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours. An aliquot was removed and filtered. The batch was then heated to 60 °C and stirred for 8 hours, and then allowed to slowly cool to improve the filtration properties of the solids. Crude Compound 8 [5.12 kg, 75.7% (accounts for 4.5 wt % ethanol)] was isolated with chemical purity of 99.39% (AUC) by HPLC. In this case the purity was sufficient to further process this material by MCC. The purity can be enhanced, if necessary, through formation of the DCM. The chiral resolution of Compound 8 DCM to Compound 10 described in Example 4 and the recycling of Compound 9 to Compound 8 described in Example 5 are shown in Scheme IV. Scheme IV 64 Example 6. The present example describes the chiral resolution by diastereomeric salt formation and isolation of (-)-tnmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 //-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione. As an alternative to chiral resolution by MCC, a resolution of the enantiomers, Compound 10 and Compound 9, can also be achieved by the preferential formation of a diastereomeric salt of Compound 10. In one example, crude Compound 8 can be converted to (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4Hpyrrolo [3,2,1 -ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dionc-( 15,2Α)-(+)pseudoephedrine (Compound lO^lS^SH+J-pseudoephedrine in Scheme I) using the following representative procedure. (1 S,2A)-(+)-pscudocphcdrinc (601 g, 0.6 equiv) is dissolved in acetonitrile (CH3CN) (11.2 L, 5 vol) at about 50 °C and stirred for approximately 30 minutes past dissolution. Crude Compound 8 [2.24 kg, 96.4% (AUC) by HPLC] is dissolved in CH3CN (11.2 L, 5 vol) at about 50 °C and then polish filtered through a pad of Celite. The Compound 8 solution is added via a drop tank to the (15,2Α)-(+)pseudoephedrine solution over 20-30 minutes at about 50 °C. Once the resulting solution begins to crystallize, shortly after completion of the Compound 8 addition, the mixture is stirred until it slowly cools to ambient temperature, then stirring is continued overnight (about 11 h total of cooling and stirring). The beige granular solids are filtered through an 18” stainless steel nutche filter and rinsed/re-slurried using CH3CN (7 L, 3.2 vol). The slurry is filtered, and the solids are slurried again with CH3CN (5 L, 2.3 vol). After drying on the nutche filter for 1 hour a sample is analyzed by HPLC. If the solids contain a higher than desired amount of the undesired diastereomeric salt, the solids can be re-slurried using CH3CN and dried before repeating the analysis. The solids are then dried under hot Ν2 (51 °C) overnight. Typically, analysis of the Compound 10-(l*S’,2,S/-(+)-pseudoephednne shows an overall chemical purity of > 99% (AUC) by HPLC and a chiral purity of > 99% Compound 10. Using 1Η NMR analysis, a typical sample is estimated to contain < 0.5 wt % CH3CN. The Compound 10·(15)25)-(+)-ρ8℮ηΰο℮ρ1ΐ℮ΰπη℮ can then be converted to Compound 10 by treatment with acid and crystallization from methanol or ethanol. A representative procedure is as follows: Compound 10·(15)25)-(+)-ρ8℮ηΰο℮ρ1ΐ℮ΰπη℮ (50 g) is slurried in Methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHL) (500 mL) and water (250 mL). 1 Μ HC1 (110 mL) is added to the mixture to reach a final pH of 1.6. The resulting solution with a slight amount of solids is stirred for about one hour to dissolve the solids. The organic and aqueous layers are then separated. The organic layer is washed with a water/brine solution (1:1, 250 mL), separated, and 2-B ethanol (1000 mL) is added. The solution is then concentrated down to 200 mL and analyzed for MeTHF content (4.8 wt %). The solution is polish filtered, and Compound 10 seeds (0.2 g) are added (Τ = 25 °C). The mixture is stirred for about three days with samples being taken periodically and analyzed for Compound 10 remaining in the mother liquor. The resulting slurry is filtered, and the solids are washed with 2-B ethanol (70 mL). The solids are dried for about three hours in a vacuum oven at about 60 °C to give Compound 10 [28.84 g, 82.7%, 99.60% (AUC) by HPLC, 0.54 wt % ethanol, 0.08 wt % MeTHF] as a beige solid. The diasteromeric salt resolution of Compound 8 to Compound 10 described in Example 6 and the recycling of Compound 9 to Compound 8 described in Example 5 are shown in Scheme V. 1. MeTHF, 1Μ HCI 2.

The present example describes chiral separation by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). As an alternative to chiral resolution by MCC or a traditional kinetic resolution by diastereomeric salt formation, a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of the enantiomers Compound 10 and Compound 9 can also be achieved by the preferential formation of a diastereomeric salt of Compound 10 with simultaneous in situ racemization of Compound 9. In this process, crude Compound 8 can be converted to Compound 10·(15)25)-(+)pseudoephedrine using the following representative procedure. Crude Compound 8 (1.25 kg, 96% AUC, 9.1 wt % solvent content) and (1 S,2S)-(+)-pscudocphcdrinc (559 g, 1.0 equiv) were slurried in 2Β- ethanol (11.25 L, 9 vol) and heated to 50 °C for 3 hours. The slurry was treated with 21 wt % NaOEt in methanol or ethanol (110 g, 0.1 equiv) and heated to 50 °C. After 40 hours, the mixture was quenched by adding 1 Μ HC1 (338 mL, 0.1 equiv) in water (786 mL, ~10% water relative to ethanol) over 5 minutes. The mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 1 hour, and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature over 0.5 hours. The slurry was stirred at room temperature for another 3 hours, and then filtered. The solids were washed with 10% water/2B- ethanol (3.75 L, 3 vol) and dried in a vacuum oven (50 °C, 2 trays) for 18 hours. The solids were analyzed and showed Compound 10·(1Α,25)-(+)pseudoephedrine [1.22 Kg, 74%, 99.3% (AUC) by HPLC, 99.2% (AUC) by chiral HPLC], This process was carried out on 20 kg of Compound 8 to afford Compound 10·(1Α,25)-(+)pseudoephedrine [18.9 kg, 70%, %, 98.8% (AUC) by HPLC, 99.1% (AUC) by chiral HPLC], The dynamic kinetic resolution of Compound 8 to Compound 10 via Compound 10·( lS,2A)-(+)-pseudoephedrine is shown in Scheme VI. 1.

The present example describes chiral separation by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). As an alternative to chiral resolution by MCC or a traditional kinetic resolution by diastereomeric salt formation, a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of the enantiomers Compound 10 and Compound 9 can also be achieved by the preferential formation of a diastereomeric salt of Compound 10 with simultaneous in situ racemization of Compound 9. In this process, crude Compound 8 (111.4 kg), Pd scavenger resin (PL-TMT-MP, 3.5 kg), and methanol (1507 L) were added to a container and heated to 45 °C for at least 16 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, the mixture was filtered to remove the Pd scavenger resin. The container was rinsed with methanol (104 L). The combined filtrate was distilled to -600 L. (lS,2S)-(+)-pscudocphcdrinc (51.4 kg) and methanol (416 L) were added to the filtrate. The resulting solution was heated at 45 °C for 3-4 hours. Solids were precipitated and analyzed by HPLC to ensure the reaction was proceedingly selective. A solution of sodium methoxide in methanol (21% wt, 6.1 kg) was then added followed by methanol (11 L), and the resulting mixture was heated at 45 °C for an additional 18 hours. The reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC for completion of the crystallization. Upon completion of the crystallization, the reaction mixture was treated with HC1 solution (3.5 kg) to neutralize the base. The resulting mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and agitated for a minimum of 3 hours. The solids were then isolated by filtration, and the filter cake was washed with a solution of methanol and water (411 L to 46 L, respectively). The filter cake was colorless (if significant color persisted in the solids, the washing was repeated to remove the color). The solids were dried in a filter dryer at 55 °C under vacuum for a minimum of 8 hours and released for use in the next step as Compound 10·(1Α,25)-(+)-ρ8℮ϋάο℮ρ1ΐ℮άπη℮ (101 kg). Example 9. The present example describes a slurry method to prepare {-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione. Compound 10·(1Α,25)-(+)-ρ8℮υΰο℮ρ1ΐ℮ΰπη℮ (100.7 kg) and a solution of aqueous HC1 (1Μ, 250 kg) and methanol (240 kg) were mixed, and the resulting slurry was heated to 50 °C and stirred for at least 2 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, the slurry was cooled to ambient temperature and stirred for a minimum of 1 hour. The solids were isolated by filtration, washed with a 50% solution of aqueous methanol (200 L), and dried under vacuum at 65 °C for at least 6 hours. The crude Compound 10 was dissolved in THF (96 kg) by heating the mixture to 50 °C. The resulting solution was polish filtered, followed by the addition of methanol (200 kg). The solution was then concentrated azeotropically and atmospherically by distillation to reduce the THF content. Once the volume of the solution was reduced to 250 L, additional methanol (200 L) was added, and the concentration process was repeated. This process was repeated until the THF content was reduced to less than 5 % (vol./voL). During the addition of methanol, one or more crystals of Compound 10 (300 g) were also introduced in order to facilitate crystallization. The crystals were isolated by filtration, washed with additional 50 % aqueous methanol, and dried under vacuum at 65 °C for at least 12 hours. Crude Compound 10 (60.6 kg) was isolated as a red-brown solid. Example 10, The present example describes a slurry method to prepare Form 1 polymorph of (-)mms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione. Crude Compound 10 was prepared as described in Example 9. The crude Compound 10 was dissolved in THF (96 kg) by heating the mixture to 50 °C. The resulting solution was polish filtered, followed by the addition of methanol (200 kg) and Form 1 of Compound 10 as seeds to impart polymorphic control of the crystallization process. Seeds to impart polymorphic control were taken from representative batches in which characterization data had confirmed that the crystalline material was of the desired polymorphic form. The solution was then concentrated azeotropically and atmospherically by distillation to reduce the THF content. Once the volume of the solution was reduced to 250 F, additional methanol (200 F) was added, and the concentration process was repeated. This process was repeated until the THF content was reduced to less than 5 % (vol./voL). The temperature of the solution was then reduced to 50 °C and stirred for at least 4 hours. Aliquots were removed to confirm formation of the desired polymorph. If required, the polymorph can be redissolved in THF (30% of batch volume), polish filtered, concentrated and seeded to obtain the desired polymorph. When the desired polymorph was obtained, a solution of 50 % aqueous methanol was added at 50 °C, and the solution was agitated for an additional 2-3 hours. The solution was then cooled to ambient temperature and held for at least 2 hours to allow crystallization. Upon completion, the crystals were isolated by filtration, washed with additional 50 % aqueous methanol, and dried under vacuum at 65 °C for at least 12 hours. Polymorphic Form 1 of Compound 10 (60.6 kg) was isolated as a red-brown solid. Form 2 polymorph of (-)-tnmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(lFf-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione can also be prepared with the above method if the Form 1 seed crystal is replaced by the Form 2 seed crystal. Example 11. Example 11 describes a method to generate XRPD diffractograms of polymorphs of ()-tnmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione X-Ray Powder Diffraction patterns were collected on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using Cu Κα radiation (40kV, 40mA), θ-θ goniometer, divergence of V20 and receiving slits, a graphite secondary monochromator and a scintillation counter. The instrument performance is checked using a certified Corundum standard (NIST 1976). The software used for data collection was Diffrac Plus XRD Commander ν2.3.1 and the data were analyzed and presented using Diffrac Plus EVA ν 11,0.0.2 or ν 13.0.0.2. Powder samples were prepared as flat plate specimens. Approximately 35 mg of the sample was gently packed into a cavity cut into polished, zero-background (510) silicon wafer. The sample was rotated in its own plane during analysis. The details of the data collection are: Angular range: 2 to 42 °20 Step size: 0.05 °20 Collection time: 4 s/step. Example 12, Example 12 describes a method to generate XRPD diffracto grams of polymorphs of ()-tnmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione High resolution X-Ray Powder Diffraction patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Κα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA), θ-2θ goniometer, and a divergence of V4 and receiving slits, a Ge-monochromator and a Lynxeye detector. The instrument performance is checked using a certified Corundum standard (NIST 1976). The software used for data collection was Diffrac Plus XRD Commander ν2.5.0 and the data were analyzed and presented using Diffrac Plus EVA ν 11,0.0.2 or ν 13.0.0.2. Samples were run under ambient conditions as flat plate specimens using powder as received. Approximately 100 mg of the sample was gently packed into a circular cavity cut into polished, zero-background (510) silicon wafer. The sample was rotated in its own plane during analysis. The details of the data collection for the generic procedure are: Angular range: 2 to 42 °20 Step size: 0.05 °20 Collection time: 5 s.step'1 Example 13. Example 13 describes XRPD patterns from polymorphs of {-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione Two non-solvated polymorphs of (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione: Form 1 and Form 2 (See, Figures 12 and 13). Form 1 shows a XRPD pattern comprising 2θ values in degrees of 8.2, 10.8 and 14.1. (See, Figure 12 and Table 1) Form 2 shows a XRPD patter comprising 2θ values in degrees of 6.5, 9.9 and 12.0.

Form 1 is orthorhombic and contains four molecules of (-)mms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione per cell. Form 1 has a melting point of -218 °C recorded in DSC (See, Figure 16). Form 2 is comprised of birefringent rod-like crystals. No discemable change in crystalline form or purity was observed upon storage of multiple batches of Form 2 at 40 °C/ 75% RH for up to six months and 25 °C/ 60% RH for up to 12 months. The space group of Form 2 was either P2\ or Ρ2: there are two molecules of (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-47/-pyrrolo [3,2,1-z/] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione in the unit cell (one molecule in the asymmetric unit), and there is no excess volume in the unit cell that is occupied by a solvent molecule. Form 2 has a melting point of -216 °C recorded in DSC (See, Figure 16). Upon scale-up of the Compound 10 process to > 5 kg production as a single batch, Form 1 was spontaneously produced. Infra-red (IR) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) were determined to be effective analytical tools for the identification and differentiation of the two forms (See, Figures 14 and 15). The process was readily controlled via seeding demonstrated at a 7-kg scale. The two polymorphs can be interconverted when proper conditions are used to control the crystallization process. Form 2 can be obtained by dissolving Form 1 in methanol, seeding with Form 2 and evaporating the mixture to dryness by rotary evaporation. The successful conversion was determined to be Form 2 by IR analysis and corroborated by XRPD analysis. Example 15. The IR spectrum of Form 1 displayed an intense vibration centered at -3300 cm"1 that was not observed in Form 2 (Figure 15, Panel A), whereas the IR spectrum of Form 2 showed a relatively intense peak centered at -800 cm"1 which was not observed in Form 1 (Figure 15, Panel Β). Form 1 and Form 2 have different equilibrium solubilities: Form 2 = 0.61 mg/mL and Form 1 =0.51 mg/mL. Figure 17, Panel A shows the solubility of Forms 1 and 2 in methanol from 0-70 °C. Figure 17, Panel Β shows the intrinsic solubility of Forms 1 and 2 in 50 mM pH 6.8 phosphate buffer/1% SLS. Example 16. Exponentially growing MDA-MB-231 cells or MIA PaCa-2 (also known as PACA-2) cells were seeded at 1,000 cells per well in six-well plates and allowed to attach for 24 hours. MDA-MB-231 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (ν/ν) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5 ml Penicillin/Streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. MDA-MB-23 1 and MIA PaCa-2 were established in estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer and pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, respectively. (±)-c/.v-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione or f±)-tnmv-3-f5,6-dihydro-4//pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione were each dissolved at a concentration of 10 mM in DMSO, and separately added to cells at a concentration of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1 or 2 μΜ. Control plates received DMSO alone, at the same percentage of total culture volume as that administered in conjunction with the highest concentration of drug. Cell cultures were observed daily for 10-15 days, then fixed and stained with modified Wright-Giemsa stain (Sigma). Treatment with (±)-c/.v-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(lH-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione or (±)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4Hpyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione results in cell death of MDA-MB-231 cells or Paca-2 cells. See, e.g., Figure 2. The IC5o for (+)-℮Α-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione was found to be 0.5 μΜ. The IC5o value for (±)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione was found to be 0.5 μΜ. Example 17. MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC #ΗΤΒ-26), grown in DMEM plus 15% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum plus 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, were plated in 60 mm2 plates (2 χ 105 cells per plate). After two days candidate compounds in DMSO at various concentrations were diluted in media and added to individual plates such that the final DMSO concentration in the cell culture media was 0.1%. After two days incubation the culture was trypsinized, cells were washed with media, counted using a hemocytometer and 500 cells, including cell bodies, were plated in 100 mm2 plates in media. Two weeks later the media was removed and the cell colonies were fixed with methanol for 10 minutes, stained with 1% crystal violet for 10 minutes, washed with water and air dried. Cell colonies were visually counted when there were greater then 50 cells present per colony. Plating efficiency was defined as the average number of colonies formed divided by 500. The surviving fraction was defined as the plating efficiency of a candidate compound divided by the plating efficiency of DMSO multiplied by 100. For candidate compound titrations, the IC50 value was determined by fitting the equation y=AeBx to the data points and extrapolating the concentration where surviving fraction equaled 50. Treatment with (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione or (+)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 //-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione results in cell death of MDA-MB-231 cells. See, e.g., Figure 3. The IC50 for (-)-mmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione was found to be 0.62 μΜ. The IC50 for (+)-tnmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione was found to be 4.1 μΜ. Example 18. Recombinant Protein Kinase C (Calbiochem) (100 ng) was incubated with (+)-℮Α-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione or (±)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione at 0.05, 0.5, or 10 μΜ for 15 minutes at room temperature. Subsequently, a radioactive labeling mix in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgC’k) containing 20 μΜ ATP, 0.2 pCi/ul y32P-ATP, 0.2μμ/μ1 Histone HI (Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore, Bedford, ΜΑ) was added to each sample. The kinase reaction was carried out for 5 minutes at room temperature. Reaction products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Treatment of recombinant Protein Kinase C for 15 minutes at room temperature with (±)-c/.v-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione or (±)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione at the tested concentrations did not reduce kinase activity in comparison to treatment with carrier alone. See, e.g., Figure 4. Example 19. MDA-MB-231 cells were serum-deprived overnight (16 hours) in the absence or in the presence of the indicated concentrations of the separate enantiomers (+)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione and (-)mms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione. Cells were treated with 100 ng/ml recombinant human Hepatocyte Growth Factor/Scatter Factor (HGF/SF) (R&D Systems #294-HG) for 10 minutes. Whole cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM betaglycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3V04, 1 pg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay using the BioRad reagent (BioRad, Hercules, CA), according to the manufacturer’s directions. Samples (50 pg of protein) were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (BioRad). The membrane was incubated 1 hour in TBS-T (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 7.6), 200 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% milk. Proteins were detected by incubation overnight at 4°C in TBS-T with 5% milk and either a polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated c-Met (#3121) or a monoclonal antibody against P-actin (Α-5441) (Sigma), which was used as a control for total protein loading. After extensive washing in TBS-T, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) or anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) (Amersham Biosciences) was added for 1 hour, and specific protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. See, e.g., Figure 5. Treatment with (-)-tnmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-l-yl)-4-( 1/7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione inhibits both basal and HGF-induced autophosphorylation of c-Met at a concentration of at least 30 ηΜ. In contrast, (+)-fr<mv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione had only a minimum inhibitory effect on c-Met phosphorylation at much greater concentrations (20 μΜ). See, e.g., Figure 5. Example 20, Α549 human lung cancer cells in a 96-well plate (Costar 3603, 5,000/well) were treated with either A) DMSO as a control; Β) 1.2 μΜ (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione for 38 hours before addition of 1:200 fluorescent Annexin V (green) and 1:500 Propidium iodide (magenta, final concentration of 1 pg/mL). The labeling procedure was allowed to process at 37°C for 20 minutes followed by image acquisition and analysis using an IC100 Image Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc) with 10Χ amplification. To determine whether (-)-/rans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4Fl-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(l/f-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione works primarily through a cytostatic or apoptotic mechanism, cancer cells exposed to (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1-yl)-4-( 1 //-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione were stained with fluorescently labeled Annexin V (green fluorescence) and propidium iodide (bright magenta fluorescence). Annexin V is a well-validated reagent that specifically binds with high affinity to externalized membrane phosphatidylserine, an early marker of the onset of apoptosis, while propidium iodide is a marker for dead cells. Incubation of human lung cancer cells (Α549) with 1.2 μΜ (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione for 38 hours induced cells to undergo apoptosis as evidenced by strong Annexin V staining. A small percentage of cells (-10-20%) co-stain with both Annexin V and propidium iodide, indicating that a sub-population of (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1-yl)-4-(177-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione treated cells were already dead within 38 hours. These data are consistent with (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(1 7/-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione inducing cell death largely through activation of apoptotic mechanisms. (See, Figure 6) Example 21. MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with indicated concentrations of (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione for 24 hours. 300 μ1 of each cell suspension (at a concentration 0.5 χ 106 cells/mL in serum free medium) was placed in individual inserts and incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C. The bottom wells housing the inserts contained 500 μ1 of 10% FBS containing medium. At 24 hours the medium from each insert was aspirated, and cells that failed to invade were gently removed from the interior of the inserts with a cotton tipped swab. Each insert was then transferred to a clean well containing cell stain solution and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The bottom of the insert was destained by incubating in extraction solution and OD was measured at 560 ηΜ. (-)-tnms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1Η-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione inhibited the migration across interstices in confluent cultures of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. The data represent the mean of two independent experiments. (See Figure 7) The morbidity and mortality resulting from most cancers is the result of local invasion and metastasis from the primary tumors to other tissues. This process mostly depends on the motility and growth of tumor cells. Activation of c-Met by HGF induces a variety of cellular responses including motility, invasion, wound healing and tissue regeneration. It has been established that aberrant activation of c-Met plays a critical role in the development and progression of primary tumors and secondary metastases. HGF has the ability to dissociate epithelial sheets and to stimulate cell motility and invasion through extracellular matrix substrates, and HGF production correlates with tumor metastasis in vivo. As shown above, (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1Η-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione inhibited the invasive phenotype of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with an estimated IC50 value of approximately 500 ηΜ. Similar results were seen with brain and lung cancer cells. That is, the results show that (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4Hpyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione inhibits metastatic cancer cell invasion.

MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were inoculated subcutaneously into female athymic nude mice (8.0χ106 cells/mouse) and allowed to form palpable tumors. Once the tumors reached approximately 60 mm3, the animals were treated orally with (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4Hpyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione at 200 mg/kg or vehicle control daily (5 consecutive days, followed by a 2 day dosing holiday). (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione was formulated in PEG 400:20% Vitamin Ε TPGS (60:40). The animals received a total of 20 doses of (-)-tnms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione or vehicle control. Tumors were measured throughout treatment and the post-treatment observation period. Each point represents the mean ± SEM of ten tumors. (See, Figure 8) Treatment with (-)-tnms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-f 1 //indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione as monotherapy was effective at slowing tumor growth. Tumor growth inhibition of (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione was calculated to be 79% and was statistically significant (ρ = 0.009). There was no significant change in body weight due to oral administration of the vehicle or (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1-yl)-4- ( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione at 200 mg/kg. Example 23. In a human colon cancer xenograft model HT-29 human colon cancer cells were inoculated subcutaneously into female athymic nude mice (5 χ 106 cells/mouse) and allowed to form palpable tumors. Once the tumors reached approximately 60 mm3, the animals were treated orally with either (-)-tnms-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1Η-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione at 200 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg, or vehicle control daily (5 consecutive days, followed by a 2 day dosing holiday). (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(17f-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione was formulated in PEG 400:20% Vitamin Ε TPGS (60:40). The animals received a total of 20 treatments of either ()-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5- dione or vehicle control. Tumors were measured throughout treatment and the post-treatment observation period. Each point represents the mean ± SEM of ten tumors. (See, Figure 9, Panel A) In this highly aggressive colon xenograft model, animals dosed with either 200 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg as a monotherapy showed significant tumor growth inhibition, with 300 mg/kg being more efficacious than 200 mg/kg. (-)-mmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione dosed at 200 mg/kg showed an optimal tumor growth inhibition of 39% (ρ = 0.006), while 300 mg/kg showed an optimal tumor growth inhibition of 55% (ρ = 0.00001). There was no significant change in body weight due to oral administration of either vehicle control or (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4Hpyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione at 200 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg. The efficacy of (-)-/nmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1Η-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione was also tested in xenograft models with several other cancer cell lines: human pancreatic cancer MIA PaCa2 (Figure 9, Panel Β), human prostate cancer PC3 (Figure 9, Panel C) and human gastric cancer ΜΚΝ45 (Figure 9, Panel D). The cells were treated with (-)-mmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-l-yl)-4-( 1/7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione as a monotherapy at indicated concentrations. In all these models, (-)-/nmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione significantly inhibited tumor growth. Example 24, (-)-/nmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione showed significant cytotoxicity against multiple cancer cell lines. Various cancer cell lines were treated with (-)-/ra/is-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 17/-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione at indicated concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 30 μΜ. The sensitivity of these cells to (-)-/nmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(177-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione was measured by a standard cytoxicity MTS assay (Figure 10). Human cancer cell lines expressing c-Met and/or phospho-c-Met were sensitive to (-)-/nmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1Η-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione. In contrast, human cancer cell lines with no immunodetectable c-Met or phospho-c-Met (Figure 10, SK-MEF-28, MCF-7 andNCI-H661) showed little sensitivity. Example 25. (-)-tra«.s-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione was assessed for its activity to inhibit a large panel (η = 230) of human kinases. The data shown in Table 2 demonstrated that (-)-tra«.s-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1-yl)-4-(l/f-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione inhibited only c-Met to a significant degree and demonstrated modest activity against a small number of other kinases. (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione showed an inhibitory constant (Κ;) of ~360 ηΜ against c-Met.

A human colon cancer xenograft model with HT-29 human colon cancer cells was established as described in Example 23. The tumor-bearing mice were treated with a single dose of (-)-tra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (300 mg/kg). The reduction of phospho-c-Met was detected immunohistochemically 24 hours later. A significant decrease in the amount of phospho-c-Met was visualized with the use of an immunoperoxidase system employing diaminobenzidine, which yields an insoluble brown reaction product (Figure 11, Panel A). Western blotting of the tumor sample for phospho-c-Met confirmed the immunohistochemical analysis (Figure 11, Panel Β). Example 27. The present example describes the inhibition of c-Met Receptor Tyrosine Kinase in Clear Cell Sarcoma and MiT (Microphthalmia Transcription Factor)-Associated Tumors. Compounds of the invention also demonstrated efficacy in a patient with clear cell sarcoma. The studies described in the present example used (-)-tran.v-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,-dione, a small molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. {-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,-dione is a selective inhibitor of c-Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase. When abnormally activated, c-Met plays multiple roles in aspects of human cancer, including cancer cell growth, survival, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. The data described above demonstrate that (-)-fra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,-dione inhibits c-Met activation in a wide range of human tumor cell lines, including clear cell sarcoma, and show anti-tumor activity against several human tumor xenografts. In clinical studies, treatment with (-)-mmv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,-dione has been well tolerated and has resulted in tumor responses and prolonged stable disease across broad ranges of tumors and doses. {-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 Af-indol-3 -yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,-dione was administered to a patient with clear cell sarcoma. In particular, (-)tra«.v-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,dione demonstrated a partial response, as defined by RECAST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), in a patient with clear cell sarcoma. The objective response to (-)-tra«.s-3-(5,6-dihydro-4//-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1-yl)-4-(lAf-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,-dione administration was seen in a cohort of patients affected by a molecularly-linked group of sarcoma tumor types for which there is no effective treatment. Based on this response, (-)-fra/iv-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1-yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,-dione is administered at a dose of 360 milligrams (mg) twice daily (b.i.d.). {-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 Af-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,-dione is administered to patients with MiT (Microphthalmia Transcription Factor)-associated tumors. MiT tumors, which can include clear cell sarcoma (CCS), alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and translocation-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), are linked biologically through a common chromosomal abnormality that is responsible for the overexpression of c-Met resulting in the development of these tumors. Tumors with this abnormality are resistant to current therapies and, in the absence of successful surgical resection, are invariably fatal. During the first stage of a study, 23 patients were enrolled and treated with 120 mg of ()-tran.v-3-(5,6-dihydro-4/7-pyrrolo [3,2,1-//] quinolin-1 -yl)-4-( 1 /7-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,dione b.i.d. Fourteen of these patients were shown to be evaluable for efficacy. In addition to the patient with the confirmed partial response, ten of the evaluable patients have demonstrated stable disease. The objective clinical response demonstrated for (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(lH-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,-dione builds upon the data which showed that knockout of MiT expression by shRNA suppressed c-Met expression and impeded the growth of human clear cell sarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo. This finding led to the 5 development of a clinical trial in patients with MiT-associated tumors using (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-l-yl)-4-(lH-indol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2, 5,-dione, which has shown anti-cancer activity, including objective tumor responses, as well as the ability to inhibit the c-Met protein in tumor biopsies from patients treated with the drug.
