Synthesis of Compound 72
Acryloyl chloride (947.2 mg, 10.47 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of compound 71 (450.5 mg, 1.95 mmol) and TEA (590.8 mg, 5.85 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (20 ml) with stirring at 0° C. in an ice bath. The reaction mixture was stirred for 18 hours at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of water (50 mL) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (20 mL×3). The organic layer was combined, washed with brine (30 mL), dried over anhydrous sulfate sodium, filtered and concentrated to afford compound 72 (255.4 mg, 46%) as a yellow solid.
