The present invention relates to a negative active material, a method of preparing the same, and a lithium battery including the negative active material. Secondary lithium batteries used in portable electronic devices for information communication, such as personal digital assistances (PDAs), mobile phones, or notebook computers, electric bicycles, electronic vehicles, etc. have a discharge voltage that is at least 2 times greater than those of conventional batteries and thus exhibit high energy density. A secondary lithium battery includes a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and either an organic electrolytic solution or a polymer electrolytic solution filling a space between the positive and negative electrodes, wherein the positive and negative electrodes each include an active material that allows lithium ions to be intercalated and deintercalated. In this structure, when lithium ions are intercalated and deintercalated between the positive and negative electrodes, oxidation and reduction reactions occur and thus, electrical energy is generated. An example of a positive active material for a secondary lithium battery is an oxide that includes lithium and a transition metal and has a structure enabling intercalation of lithium ions. Examples of the oxide are lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2), lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO2), and lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (Li[NiCoMn]O2, Li[Ni1-x-yCoxMy]O2). For use as a negative active material, research into various carbonaceous materials including artificial and natural graphite, hard carbon, and non-carbonaceous materials such as silicon (Si), which allow lithium ions to be intercalated and deintercalated, is being performed. Non-carbonaceous materials show very high capacity density that is at least 10 times greater than that of graphite. WO2009/106507 discloses graphite nanoplatelets prepared by thermal plasma expansion of intercalated graphite followed by exfoliation of the expanded graphite. The graphite nanoplatelets can be used in plastic, ink, coating, lubricant or grease compositions. WO02/096801 discloses an active carbon agglomerate based on coal derived from vegetable matter and tar-based binder. The agglomerate can be used in catalysis as catalyst or catalyst support and in liquid-phase or gas-phase adsorption process. US2010/021819 discloses a composite composition for electrochemical cell electrode applications, the composition comprising multiple solid particles, wherein (a) a solid particle is composed of graphene platelets dispersed in or bonded by a first matrix or binder material, wherein the graphene platelets are not obtained from graphitization of the first binder or matrix material; (b) the graphene platelets have a length or width in the range of 10 nm to 10 µm; (c) the multiple solid particles are bonded by a second binder material; and (d) the first or second binder material is selected from a polymer, polymeric carbon, amorphous carbon, metal, glass, ceramic, oxide, organic material, or a combination thereof. However, due to volumetric expansion and shrinkage during charging and discharging of lithium, the capacity retention rate, charge/discharge efficiency, and lifetime characteristics of the non-carbonaceous materials may decrease. Accordingly, there is a need to develop high performance negative active materials having improved capacity characteristics and cycle life characteristics. According to a first aspect of the present invention, a negative active material includes a carbonaceous core that has a sulfur content of from about 10 ppm to 900 ppm and an amorphous carbon layer continuously formed on a surface of the carbonaceous core, wherein the carbonaceous core has a crystalloid plate structure, and a crystallite size of about 10 nm to about 45 nm measured using X-ray diffraction. The crystallite size is measured from a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak with respect to a (002) plane in an X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core, using Scherrer's equation. An amorphous carbon layer "continuously formed" on a surface of the carbonaceous core" indicates that the amorphous carbon layer does not have cracks therein. In an embodiment of the invention, the carbonaceous core has a peak with respect to a plane (002) at a Bragg angle 2θ of 26.4°±0.1° in the X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core. The carbonaceous core may have a full width at half maximum of the peak with respect to the plane (002) of about 0.2° to about 0.6 in the X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core. The carbonaceous core may have an interlayer spacing (d002)of the plane (002) measured by X-ray diffraction of about 3.36Å to about 3.37Å. The amorphous carbon layer may be a pitch coating. The negative active material may be spherical or oval. A longer direction particle size thereof d50 is from about 1µm to about 40 µm. The negative active material may have voids therein. The BET specific surface area of the negative active material may be from about 1 m2/g to about 30 m2/g. The tap density of the negative active material may be from about 0.2 g/cm3 to 2.0 g/cm3. The negative active material may additionally include metal nanoparticles. The metal nanoparticles may be selected from the group consisting of silicon (Si), tin (Sn), nickel (Ni), and a mixture thereof. A size of the metal nanoparticles may be from about 1 nm to about 500 nm. According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of preparing a negative active material including preparing a carbonaceous core; forming an amorphous carbon layer on the carbonaceous core, wherein the carbonaceous core has a crystalloid plate structure, and a crystallite size of about 10 nm to about 45 nm, measured from an X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core. The crystallite size is measured from a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak with respect to a (002) plane in an X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core, using Scherrer's equation. The preparing of the carbonaceous core may include preparing a carbonaceous material having a crystalloid plate structure, and forming the carbonaceous material in a spherical shape. The preparing of the carbonaceous material having the crystalloid plate structure may include expanding graphite by using an expanding agent, and heat treating the graphite. The expanding agent may include at least one selected from the group consisting of a sulfuric acid, a nitric acid, a hydrochloric acid, an acetic acid, and a perchloric acid. The amount of the expanding agent used may be from about 1 to about 70 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the graphite. The heat-treatment may be performed at a temperature of about 400°C to about 800°C. According to a third aspect of the present invention, a lithium battery includes a positive electrode including a positive active material; a negative electrode including the negative active material of the invention in its first aspect; and an electrolytic solution interposed between the positive and negative electrodes. A more complete appreciation of the present invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof, will be readily apparent as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein: FIG. 1A shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a carbonaceous core prepared according to Preparation Example 1;FIG. 1B shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a carbonaceous core prepared according to Preparation Example 1;FIG. 2 shows a SEM image of a negative active material prepared according to Example 1;FIG. 3 shows an enlarged SEM image at 10 x magnification of a negative active material prepared according to Example 1;FIG. 4 shows a SEM image of a negative active material prepared according to Comparative Example 1;FIG. 5 shows an enlarged SEM image at 3.5 x magnification of a negative active material prepared according to Comparative Example 1;FIG. 6 shows a TEM image of a cross-section of a negative active material particle prepared according to Example 1;FIG. 7 shows size distribution results of a negative active material prepared according to Example 1;FIG. 8A shows X-ray diffraction analysis results of carbonaceous cores prepared according to Preparation Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Preparation Example 2;FIG. 8B shows X-ray diffraction analysis results of a carbonaceous core prepared according to Comparative Preparation Example 4;FIG. 9 is an exploded perspective view of a lithium battery according to an embodiment; andFIG. 10 shows a graph showing capacity characteristics of lithium batteries prepared according to Example 3 and Comparative Examples 5 to 7. A negative active material according to the invention includes a carbonaceous core that has a sulfur content of about 10 ppm to 900 ppm; and an amorphous carbon layer continuously formed on a surface of the carbonaceous core. The carbonaceous core has a crystalloid plate structure, and a crystallite size, measured from a full width at half maximum of the peak with respect to the surface (002) of about 10 nm to about 45 nm in an X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core. The sulfur content of the carbonaceous core may be from about 10 ppm to about 900 ppm, or from about 10 ppm to about 700 ppm, or from about 10 ppm to about 620 ppm. The sulfur content indicates the residual content of a sulfuric acid that is used as an expanding agent when the carbonaceous core is prepared, and may be quantified by using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrometry. If the carbonaceous core has a sulfur content within the range described above, side reactions, for example, generation of SO2 gas, may be prevented and thus, the amorphous carbon layer may be continuously formed on the surface of the carbonaceous core without cracks. The negative active material including the amorphous carbon layer continuously formed on the surface of the carbonaceous core is not divided into portions defined by interfaces and thus has a stable state. Thus, lithium may be easily intercalated or deintercalated, and a lithium battery including the negative active material may have improved initial efficiency and lifetime characteristics. The carbonaceous core has e a crystalloid plate structure. The crystal structure of the carbonaceous core may also be confirmed by referring to FIG. 8A which shows X-ray diffraction analysis results obtained using a CuK-alpha characteristic X-ray wavelength of 1.541Å. The crystallite size measured from the full width at half maximum of the peak with respect to the surface (002) in the X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core is from about 10 nm to about 45 nm, for example, about 13 nm to about 40 nm. The crystallite size of the carbonaceous core may be calculated by substituting a value of the full width at half maximum of the peak with respect to the surface (002) in the X-ray diffraction spectrum into Scherrer's equation. τ=Kλβcosθ The carbonaceous core may have a peak with respect to the plane (002) at a Bragg angle 2θ of 26.4°±0.1°, for example, at 26.3° to 26.5° in the X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core. The carbonaceous core may have a full width at half maximum of the peak with respect to the plane (002) in the X-ray diffraction spectrum of about 0.2° to about 0.6°, for example, about 0.3° to about 0.5°. The carbonaceous core may have an interlayer spacing (d002) of the plane (002) measured by X-ray diffraction of about 3.36Å to about 3.37Å, for example, about 3.361Å to about 3.37Å. The surface interval (d002) of the plane (002) of the carbonaceous core may be calculated by substituting a value of a Bragg angle 2θ at which a peak of the surface (002) is present in the X-ray diffraction spectrum obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis into Bragg's equation. From the results described above, it is confirmed that unlike typical hard carbon, the carbonaceous core is a carbonaceous material with high crystallinity. The carbonaceous core may have a plate or planar structure. The plate structure may include a deformed plate structure, such as a bent plate structure, a plate structure with a curved end, a plate structure with a partially defect portion, etc. The "plate structure" of the carbonaceous core may be easily understood by referring to the carbonaceous core shown in FIG. 1A. The carbonaceous core may have a structure in which n polycyclic nano-sheets may be stacked in a direction perpendicular to the plane, wherein each of the polycyclic nano-sheets includes fused carbon atom rings that are aligned on a plane. n may be an integer of 2 to 50, or an integer of 2 to 40, or an integer of 2 to 30. Each carbon atom ring may refer to, for example, a ring that consists of 6 carbon atoms connected in a hexagonal shape. The term "ring that consists of 6 carbon atoms connected in a hexagonal shape" used herein refers to a hexagonal ring in which carbon atoms are located at each vertex. Hereinafter, this term will also be referred to as a "6-membered carbon ring." The polycyclic nano-sheet has a plurality of 6-membered carbon rings, which are fused to one another to form a honeycomb shape, in which the carbon rings are arranged or aligned on a plane. In this case, the wording "aligning on a plane" refers to aligning and extending of a plurality of laterally fused 6-membered carbon rings. For example, the wording "aligning on a plane" does not include aligning and extending of vertically fused 6-membered carbon rings. Among carbons of the polycyclic nano-sheet, adjacent carbons may be bonded to each other via sp2 bonds. By doing so, a resonance structure may be formed in the 6-membered carbon ring and thus, electrons migrate easily. Since the polycyclic nano-sheet consists of a plurality of 6-membered carbon rings that are fused and aligned on a plane, the thickness of the polycyclic nano-sheet may be, for example, equivalent to a carbon atom size ± 0.1 nm. In this regard, the thickness of the polycyclic nano-sheet, for example, a carbon atom size ± 0.1 nm, is determined in consideration of the presence of a bent polycyclic nano-sheet, or a polycyclic nano-sheet with a curved end, or a polycyclic nano-sheet with a partial defect portion. The carbonaceous core may have a structure in which n polycyclic nano-sheets are stacked upon one another as described above. In this case, the n polycyclic nano-sheets may be stacked in a direction perpendicular to the plane on which a plurality of 6-membered carbon rings of the polycyclic nano-sheet are fused and aligned. n may be an integer of 2 to 50, or an integer of 2 to 40, or an integer of 2 to 30, or an integer of 2 to 20. Regarding the carbonaceous core, from among carbons of the n polycyclic nano-sheets, a first carbon and a second carbon, which satisfy the condition L1≥L2 (where L1 refers to a distance between the first carbon and the second carbon, and L2 refers to a distance between a third carbon and a fourth carbon, wherein the third carbon is selected from carbons of the n polycyclic nano-sheets other than the first carbon and the second carbon, and the fourth carbon is selected from carbons of the n polycyclic nano-sheets other than the first carbon, the second carbon, and the third carbon), are selected. When the first carbon is positioned at the origin A (0, 0, 0) of a three-dimensional coordinate system having an x-axis, a y-axis, and a z-axis, the second carbon may have a coordinate B (a, b, c), where a and b are each independently 10µm or less and c may be 100 nm or less. In this regard, L1 refers to a distance between the first carbon and the second carbon, and L2 refers to a distance between the third carbon and the fourth carbon, wherein the third carbon is selected from carbons of the n polycyclic nano-sheets other than the first carbon and the second carbon, and the fourth carbon is selected from carbons of the n polycyclic nano-sheets other than the first carbon, the second carbon, and the third carbon. For example, the first carbon and the second carbon may refer to two carbons with the largest distance between one another from among the carbons selected from carbons of the n polycyclic nano-sheets. a and b may be each independently 10µm or less, or about 0.1µm to about 10µm. For example, a and b may each be about 1µm to about 10 µm. a and b may respectively indicate a width and a length in a perpendicular direction to a thickness direction of the carbonaceous material. c may be 100 nm or less, or about 0.5 nm to about 100 nm, or about 0.5 nm to about 90 nm, or about 0.5 nm to about 50 nm. For example, c may be about 0.5 nm to about 20 nm, but is not limited thereto. c may indicate a length of the thickness direction of the carbonaceous material. Accordingly, the carbonaceous core may be, for example, a powder of nanoparticles having a plate or planar structure. If the carbonaceous core has such ranges of a, b and c, although not wishing to be limited to a particular theory, electrons may migrate easily and thus the carbonaceous core may have excellent conductivity The amorphous carbon layer formed on the surface of the carbonaceous core may be a pitch coating. A pitch source available for use herein may be, for example, a petroleum-based material or a coal-based material, and examples thereof include a coal-tar pitch, a petroleum pitch, an organic synthesis pitch prepared by polymerization-fusing of a fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound, and an organic synthesis pitch obtained by polymerization-fusing of a heteroatom-containing fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound. For example, the pitch source may be a coal-tar pitch, but is not limited thereto, and any one of various pitch sources available in the art may be used herein. The pitch coating may be formed by, for example, by carbonating the pitch source through heat-treatment. Due to the heat-treatment, conductivity of the negative active material may be improved. The amorphous carbon layer may be formed as a pitch coating having a thickness of about 1 nm to about 50 nm, for example, about 5 nm to about 20 nm. If the thickness of the pitch coating is within the ranges described above, a negative active material having improved conductivity may be formed. The negative active material may be, for example, spherical or oval, and a longer direction particle size of the negative active material, for example, d50 may be from about 1µm to about 40µm, for example about 5µm to about 20µm. Examples of the surface and shape of the negative active material may be seen by referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, which will be described below. The definition of d50 may be easily understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, and may be seen by referring to FIG. 7, which will be described below. When the negative active material is spherical or oval, the negative active material may provide flexibility when slurried during the preparation of an electrode. A negative active material having the d50 range described above may be suitable for the preparation of slurry, and may allow a negative electrode to be uniformly surface-coated when the negative electrode is manufactured. The core of the negative active material may have voids. The voids may be amorphous and there may be at least two voids. The pores may extend to a surface of the negative active material and may be exposed to the outside. Alternatively, the pores may be present only inside the negative active material. The presence and shape of the voids in the negative active material are confirmed by referring to FIG. 6. The voids are not present in hard carbon or conventional graphite used as a negative active material. Due to the voids, a contact area between the negative active material and lithium ions may be widened. Thus, the negative active material provides excellent capacity characteristics and cycle lifetime characteristics to a battery including the negative active material. The porosity of the negative active material may be from about 1 % to about 40 %, or about 2 % to about 10 %. The porosity may refer to a percentage of a total volume of voids based on a total volume of the negative active material. The BET specific surface area of the negative active material may be from about 1 m2/g to about 30 m2/g, or about 1 m2/g to about 18 m2/g, or about 1 m2/g to about 5 m2/g. The BET specific surface area of the negative active material is measured by a 'nitrogen adsorption BET specific surface area measurement device (ASAP2400') manufactured by Micro Meritex Co. Ltd (Sayama City, Japan). A negative active material having the BET specific surface area range described above may have excellent capacity characteristics and cycle life characteristics. The tap density of the negative active material may be from about 1.0 g/cm3 to about 2.0 g/ cm3, for example, about 1.0 g/ cm3 to about 1.9 g/ cm3. The tap density is evaluated according to JIS-K5101 by using 'powder tester PT-R' manufactured by Hosokawha Micron Co., Ltd. For example, the negative active material is dropped to a 20 cm3-capacity tapping cell through a sieve having a scale interval of 200µm until the tapping cell is completely filled. Then, tapping is performed thereon 3000 times with a stroke length of 18 mm once per second, and then, a tap density of the tapped negative active material is measured. A negative active material having a tap density within the range described above may be suitable for sustaining the sulfur content of about 10 ppm to about 900 ppm in the carbonaceous core and the amorphous carbon layer continuously formed on the carbonaceous core. Thus, lithium may be easily intercalated and deintercalated and thus, a lithium battery including the negative active material may have improved initial efficiency and lifetime characteristics. The negative active material may further include metal nanoparticles. A negative active material including metal nanoparticles may have, in addition to improved capacity characteristics and cycle life characteristics, improved conductivity. Metal nanoparticles may be selected from the group consisting of silicon (Si), tin (Sn), nickel (Ni), and a mixture thereof. At least one dimension of the metal nanoparticles may be from about 1 nm to about 500 nm. If the size of the metal nanoparticles is within the range described above, the destruction of the negative active material due to volumetric expansion of metal nanoparticles, such as Si particles, during charging and discharging may be effectively reduced. An average particle size of the negative active material that additionally includes metal nanoparticles may be from about 3 µm to about 60 µm, for example, about 3µm to about 50µm. The average particle size ranges of the negative active material described above are appropriate for slurry preparation and handling. If the average particle size of the negative active material is within the ranges described above, a final BET specific surface area is from about 3 m2/g to about 20 m2/g and thus, formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on a surface of a negative electrode may be appropriately controlled. A method of preparing a negative active material according to the invention includes preparing a carbonaceous core; and forming an amorphous carbon layer on the carbonaceous core. The carbonaceous core has a crystalloid plate structure, and a crystallite size measured from a full width at half maximum of the peak with respect to the surface (002) of about 10 nm to about 45 nm in an X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core. The preparing of the carbonaceous core may include preparing a carbonaceous material having a crystalloid plate structure; and forming the carbonaceous material in a spherical shape. The preparing of the carbonaceous material having a crystalloid plate structure may include expanding graphite by using an expanding agent, and heat treating the expanded graphite. The expanding of graphite by using an expanding agent may include immersing graphite in a solution including an expanding agent for about 1 to about 24 hours. However, the expanding method is not limited thereto, and any one of various methods for preparing expanded graphite may be used herein. The expanding agent may include at least one selected from the group consisting of a sulfuric acid, a nitric acid, a hydrochloric acid, an acetic acid, and a perchloric acid. For example, the expanding agent may include at least one selected from the group consisting of a sulfuric acid, a nitric acid, and an acetic acid. For example, the expanding agent may be a mixed solution including a sulfuric acid and an acetic acid at a mole ratio of 1: 5 to 5:1. The amount of the expanding agent may be from about 1 to about 70 parts by weight, or about 1 to about 50 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of graphite. If graphite is expanded by using an expanding agent within the quantity range described above, the carbonaceous core of the resultant negative active material may have a sulfur content of about 10 ppm to about 900 ppm. Thus, side reactions, for example generation of SO2 gas, may be prevented and thus, the amorphous carbon layer may be continuously formed on the surface of the carbonaceous core without cracks. Accordingly, lithium is easily intercalated and deintercalated, which leads to production of a lithium battery including the carbonaceous core with improved initial efficiency and lifetime characteristics. The heat-treatment temperature may be from about 400°C to about 800°C, for example, about 400°C to about 700°C. The heat treatment time may be from about 30 minutes to about 3 hours, for example, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Furthermore, a solvent may be added to the expanded graphite and the expanded graphite in the solvent may be pulverized. As the solvent, a material that does not substantially react with the expanded graphite and provides fluidity may be used. Non-limiting examples of the solvent are alcohols (for example, ethanol). Subsequently, the expanded graphite included in the solvent is pulverized. As a pulverizing method, a method using a homogenizer, a method using a micro-fluidizer, etc. may be used. The pulverizing method may be repeatedly performed a few times. Alternatively, different pulverizing methods may each be used at least twice. Meanwhile, before the expanded graphite is pulverized, the expanded graphite may be mixed with an acid. Thereafter, the solvent used is removed from the pulverized product and the resultant graphite particles are aggregated to form a spherical carbonaceous core. The removal of the solvent may be performed by using various methods in consideration of, for example, the boiling point of the solvent. For example, the pulverized product may be filtered and washed, and then heat-treated at a temperature of 80°C. The carbonaceous core has a crystalloid plate structure, and a crystallite size measured from a full width at half maximum of the peak with respect to the surface (002) in the X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core in the range of from 10 nm to 45 nm, for example, about 13 nm to about 40 nm. In the forming of an amorphous carbon layer on a carbonaceous core, for example, a pitch is provided to the surface of the carbonaceous core and then heat-treated to form an amorphous carbon layer. Examples of the pitch are a coal-tar pitch, a petroleum pitch, an organic synthesis pitch prepared by polymerization-fusing of a fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound, and an organic synthesis pitch obtained by polymerization-fusing of a heteroatom-containing fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound. For example, the pitch may be a coal-tar pitch. For example, a pitch may be provided to the surface of the carbonaceous core by chemically depositing carbon. However, the pitch formation method is not limited thereto, and may be any one of various methods available in the art. The forming of the amorphous carbon layer may include heat-treating at a temperature of about 700°C to about 2000°C, for example, 800°C to 2000°C, for 30 minutes to 72 hours. However, the heat treatment temperature and time are not limited thereto. The heat-treatment process may be performed to carbonate the pitch provided to the surface of the carbonaceous core in an inert gas atmosphere or a non-acidic atmosphere. If the heat-treatment temperature and time are within the ranges described above, crystallinity of the negative active material may be improved. A lithium battery including the negative active material may have improved capacity characteristics and lifetime characteristics. A lithium battery according to the invention includes a positive electrode including a positive active material; a negative electrode including a negative active material as described above; and an electrolytic solution interposed between the positive and negative electrodes. In this regard, the negative active material includes a carbonaceous core that has a sulfur content of about 10 ppm to 900 ppm; and an amorphous carbon layer continuously disposed on a surface of the carbonaceous core, wherein the carbonaceous core has a crystalloid plate structure and a crystallite size measured from a full width at half maximum of the peak with respect to the surface (002) of about 10 nm to about 45 nm in an X-ray diffraction spectrum of the carbonaceous core. Such a negative active material may enable effective intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions, and accordingly, a lithium battery including the negative active material may have high capacity and long lifetime. The positive electrode may include a current collector and a positive active material layer disposed on the current collector. An example of a positive active material that is used to form the positive active material layer is a compound that allows lithium to be reversibly intercalated and deintercalated, for example, a lithiated intercalation compound. Examples of the positive active material are: LiaA1-bXbD2 (where 0.95 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, and 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.5); LiaE1-bXbO2-cDc (where 0.95 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.5, and 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.05); LiE2-bXbO4-cDc (where 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.5, and 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.05); LiaNi1-b-cCobBcDα (where 0.95 ≤ a ≤1.1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.5, 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.05, and 0 < α ≤ 2); LiaNi1-b-cCobXcO2-αMα (where 0.95 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.5, 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.05, and 0 < α < 2); L1aNi1-b-cCobXcO2-αM2 (where 0.95 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.5, 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.05, and 0 < α < 2); LiaNi1-b-cMnbXcDα (where 0.95 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.5, 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.05, and 0 < α 2); LiaNi1-b-cMnbXcO2-αMα (where 0.95 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.5, 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.05, and 0 < α < 2); LiaNi1-b-cMnbXcO2-αM2(where 0.95 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.5, 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.05, and o < α < 2); LiaNibEcGdO2 (where 0.90 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.9, 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.5, and 0.001 ≤ d ≤ 0.1); LiaNibCocMndGeO2 (where 0.90 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.9, 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.5, and 0 ≤ d ≤0.5, and 0 ≤ e ≤ 0.1); LiaNiGbO2 (where 0.90 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, and 0.001 ≤ b ≤ 0.1); LiaCoGbO2 (where 0.90 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, and 0.001 ≤ b ≤ 0.1); LiaMnGbO2 (where 0.90 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, and 0.001 ≤ b ≤ 0.1); LiaMn2GbO4 (where 0.90 ≤ a ≤ 1.1, and 0 ≤ b ≤ 0.1); QO2; QS2; LiQS2; V2O5; LiV2O5; LiZO2; LiNiVO4; Li(3-f)J2(PO4)3(0 ≤ f ≤ 2); Li(3-f)Fe2(PO4)3(0 ≤ f ≤ 2); LiFePO4 ; and lithium titanate.

Meanwhile, a lithium electrode may be used as the positive electrode. A coating layer may be additionally formed on a surface of these compounds as the positive active material. Alternatively, these compounds may be mixed with a compound including a coating layer. The coating layer may include at least one a coating element compound selected from the group consisting of oxide of a coating atom, hydroxide of a coating atom, oxycarbonate of a coating atom, and hydroxycarbonate of a coating atom. The coating atom compound of the coating layer may be amorphous or crystalloid. The coating atom in the coating layer may be Mg, Al, Co, K, Na, Ca, Si, Ti, V, Sn, Ge, Ga, B, As, Zr or a mixture thereof. In a method of forming the coating layer, these compounds may be coated with the coating elements described above by using any method that does not affect properties of the positive active material. Such a method may be, for example, a spray coating method or an immersion method. These coating methods are known to one of ordinary skill in the art and thus are not described herein in detail. The positive active material layer may also include a binder. The binder allows positive active material particles to be attached to each other, and also, attaches the positive active material to the current collector. Examples of the binder are polyvinylalcohol, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, diacetylcellulose, polyvinylchloride, carboxylated polyvinylchloride, polyvinylfluoride, a polymer including ethylene oxide, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyurethane, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene-butadiene rubber, acrylated styrene-butadiene rubber, epoxy resin, and nylon. However, the binder is not limited to these materials. The current collector may include Al, but is not limited thereto. To prepare the positive electrode, a positive active material and a binder (optionally including a conductive material) are mixed in a solvent to prepare a composition for forming the positive active material layer, and the composition is applied to a current collector. Since methods of manufacturing a positive electrode are well known in the art, the method will not be described in detail in the present specification. The solvent may be, but is not limited to, N-methylpyrrolidone. The positive active material layer may also include a conductive material. The conductive material may include at least one selected from the group consisting of carbon black, ketjen black, acetylene black, artificial graphite, natural graphite, copper powder, nickel powder, aluminium powder, silver powder, and polyphenylene, but is not limited thereto. As described above, the negative electrode may include a negative active material including a carbonaceous core that has a sulfur content of about 10 ppm to 900 ppm; and an amorphous carbon layer continuously formed on a surface of the carbonaceous core. Also, according to a performance of the lithium battery, the negative active material may be used in combination with at least one selected from the group consisting of natural graphite, silicon/carbon composite (SiOx), silicon metal, silicon film, lithium metal, lithium alloy, carbonaceous materials, and graphite. An example of the lithium alloy is lithium titanate.

A conductive material which is optionally included in the composition for forming a negative active material layer may be understood by referring to the description above. In some cases, the composition for forming the positive active material layer and the composition for forming the negative active material layer may further include a plasticizer to form pores in an electrode plate. The electrolytic solution may include a non-aqueous organic solvent and a lithium salt. The non-aqueous organic solvent may act as a medium through which ions involving in an electrochemical reaction of the lithium battery may be transported. The non-aqueous organic solvent may be a carbonate-based solvent, an ester-based solvent, an ether-based solvent, a ketone-based solvent, an alcohol-based solvent, or an aprotic solvent. Examples of the carbonate-based solvent are dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), dipropyl carbonate (DPC), methylpropyl carbonate (MPC), ethylpropyl carbonate (EPC), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), and butylene carbonate (BC).

Examples of the ether-based solvent are dibutylether, tetraglyme, diglyme, dimethoxyethane, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and tetrahydrofuran. An example of the ketone-based solvent is cyclohexanone. Examples of the alcohol-based solvent include ethylalcohol and isopropyl alcohol. Examples of the aprotic solvent are: nitriles such as R-CN where R is a linear, branched, or cyclic C2 to C20 hydrocarbon group and has a double-bond aromatic ring or ether bond; amides such as dimethylformamide; and dioxolane-based sulfolanes such as a 1,3-dioxolane sulfolane. These non-aqueous organic solvents may be used alone or in combination thereof. If these non-aqueous organic solvents are used in combination, the mixture ratio may be appropriately controlled according to desired battery performance, as would be known by one of ordinary skill in the art. The lithium salt is dissolved in an organic solvent, acts as a lithium ion supplier in the lithium battery to operate the lithium battery, and promotes movement of lithium ions between the positive and negative electrodes. The lithium salt may include at least one supporting electrolytic salt selected from the group consisting of LiPF6, LiBF4, LiSbF6, LiAsF6, LiN(SO2C2F5)2, Li(CF3SO2)2N, LiC4F9SO3, LiClO4, LiAlO2, LiAlCl4, LiN(CxF2x+1SO2)(CyF2y+1SO2) where x and y are natural numbers, LiCl, LiI and LiB(C2O4)2[lithium bis(oxalato) borate; LiBOB]. The concentration of the lithium salt may be in the range of about 0.1 to about 2.0 M. If the concentration of the lithium salt is within this range, an electrolyte has appropriate levels of conductivity and viscosity and thus exhibits excellent electrolytic performance, and lithium ions may migrate effectively. According to the type of the lithium battery, a separator may be further disposed between the positive and negative electrodes. Examples of the separator are a polyethylene single layer, a polypropylene single layer, a polyvinylidene fluoride single layer, a combination thereof, a polyethylene/polypropylene double-layered structure, a polyethylene/polypropylene/polyethylene triple-layered structure, and a polypropylene/polyethylene/polypropylene triple-layered structure. The lithium battery may be a lithium ion battery, a lithium ion polymer battery or a lithium polymer battery, according to the separator used and the electrolyte used. Also, the lithium battery may be a cylindrical lithium battery, a rectangular lithium battery, a coin-like lithium battery, or a pouch-like lithium battery, according to the battery shape. Also, the lithium battery may be a bulky lithium battery or a thin lithium battery according to the battery size. Also, the lithium battery may be a primary battery or a secondary battery.
