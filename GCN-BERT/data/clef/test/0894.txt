DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS [0002] Embodiments of an apparatus are disclosed below that include a substantially cylindrical body portion and a nub that extends from a distal end of the body portion. The cylindrical body portion may be a syringe, a sheath sized to receive a syringe, or cap configured to couple to a syringe. The nub may have a rounded shape, such as a hemispherical shape, a ring shape (with rounded edges), an elliptical shape (with rounded edges), a bulbous shape, or some other rounded shape. In some embodiments, the nub may have a diameter that is less than a cross-sectional diameter of the syringe. Further, the edges of the syringe, the sheath, the cap, or any combination thereof, may be rounded, presenting a smooth transition from the elongate body portion to the distal end. In some embodiments, portions of the syringe, portions of the cap, portions of the sheath, or any combination thereof may be formed from a first material, while other portions of the syringe, the sheath, the cap, the nub, or any combination thereof may be formed from a second material. In some embodiments, the second material may be more flexible or malleable than the first material. [0003] In some embodiments, the apparatus may be used for artificial insemination by filling a fluid canal of a barrel of the syringe with seminal fluid, and by inserting the apparatus into the vaginal canal to deliver seminal fluid through the vaginal canal to the cervix of the woman. The nub may provide tactile feedback to the woman by allowing her to feel when the distal end of the apparatus is touching the cervix. Further, the feedback provided by the nub may allow the woman to adjust the position of the apparatus relative to the cervix prior to depression of the plunger of the syringe to deliver of the seminal fluid. Embodiments of the apparatus are described below with respect to Figs. 1-13. [0004] Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an apparatus 100 including a syringe 102 with a nub 106 according to some embodiments. The syringe 102 may include a body having a proximal end with a flange 104 and may define a cavity sized to receive a plunger 110 to draw fluid into the cavity and to propel fluid through the opening 108. The flange 104 may be used as leverage by a user when depressing the plunger 110. Further, the body of the syringe 102 may include a distal end with the nub 106. The distal end of the body of the syringe 102 may also include an opening 108 to allow fluid flow. In the illustrated example, the opening 108 extends through a corresponding opening in the nub 106; however, the nub 106 and the opening 108 may be offset from one another. In some embodiments, the opening 108 may be offset from a center of the distal end of the syringe 102. In some embodiments, the nub 106 may be offset from the center of the distal end. In some embodiments, the nub 106 and the opening 108 may be offset from the center of the distal end. [0005] In some embodiments, the body of the syringe 102 may have a substantially cylindrical shape (or tubular shape) forming a fluid conduit and having rounded edges at the distal end. Further, the nub 106 may have a substantially semi-spherical shape and may extend outward from the distal end of the syringe 102 proximate to a longitudinal axis 112 of the syringe 102. In some embodiments, the nub 106 may have a diameter (Di) that is orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 112 of the syringe 102 and that is smaller than a diameter (D2) of the body of the syringe 102. In some embodiments, the body of the syringe 102 may be formed from a first material, and the nub 106 may be formed from a second material. In some embodiments, the body of the syringe 102 and the nub 106 may be formed from a unitary piece of material (such as molded antibacterial plastic). [0006] In some embodiments, a user may draw fluid into a cavity within the body of the syringe 102 by pulling the plunger 110. The user may then insert the syringe 102 into the vaginal cavity and depress the plunger 110 to dispense the fluid through opening 108. The nub 108 may provide feedback to the woman to allow her to feel the position of the distal end of the syringe 102 against her cervix prior to dispensing the fluid. [0007] In some embodiments, the rounded edges of the distal end of the body of the syringe 102 and the rounded shape of the nub 108 provide a substantially smooth and relatively comfortable feel as compared to a standard syringe that has corners and a pointed (though needle-less) end. While a conventional syringe may have edges or corners that can be sharp or abrasive, the syringe 102 and the nub 108 are rounded to provide smooth edges. [0008] While the illustrated example of Fig. 1 included a single opening that extends through the nub 108, it should be understood that the distal end of the syringe 102 may include one or more openings to allow fluid passage to and from the cavity within the body of the syringe 102 and the outside environment. One possible example of a syringe that may include multiple openings is described below with respect to Fig. 2. [0009] Fig. 2 is a perspective view of an apparatus 200 including a syringe 202 with a nub 106 according to some embodiments. The syringe 202 may include the flange 104 and may include a cavity sized to receive the plunger 110. The syringe 202 further may include multiple openings 204 extending from the cavity to the outside environment. In the illustrated example, the openings 204 are distributed about the nub 106 and are offset from the nub 106. In some embodiments, additional openings 204 or fewer openings may be provided. In some embodiments, the openings 204 may be distributed circumferentially along the sidewalls of the body of the syringe 202 near the distal end. Further, in some embodiments, the openings 204 may align with corresponding openings that extend through the nub 106. [0010] In the illustrated examples of Figs. 1 and 2, the syringe 102 and 202 may be formed from a first material, such as a substantially rigid, anti-bacterial and antimicrobial plastic material, while the nub 106 may be formed from a second material, that may also have anti-bacterial and anti-microbial properties, but that may be more elastic or malleable than the first material. Additionally, in some embodiments, the nub 106 may be attached to or coupled to the syringe 102, 202. In some embodiments, the nub 106 may be integrally formed with the syringe 102, 202. An example of some embodiments of the syringe 202 having an integrally formed nub 106 and including the opening 108 is described below with respect to Fig. 3. [0011] Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view of an apparatus 300 including a syringe 202 with a nub 106 according to some embodiments. The syringe 202 may include a body portion that defines a cavity 308 that extends from a proximal end, which may include the flange 104, to a distal end, which may include openings 204, and the nub 106. Additionally, in some embodiments, the nub 106 also may include an opening 108. The openings 108 and 204 extend through the distal end of the body of the syringe 202 to permit fluid flow between a fluid area 310 and the environment. [0012] The apparatus 300 further may include the plunger 110 including a rod portion 302 and an end portion 304. A gasket or seal 306 may be coupled to the end portion 304 to provide a fluid seal to prevent fluid flow from the fluid area 310 toward the body portion 302 and to draw fluid through the openings 108 and 204 in to the fluid area 310 or to drive fluid from the fluid area 310 through the openings 108 and 204. [0013] In some embodiments, the nub 106 may be part of the distal end of the body of the syringe 202. In some embodiments, the nub 106 may omit the opening 108 and the openings 204 may be included. In some embodiments, the openings 204 may be omitted and the opening 108 may be included. [0014] In some embodiments, an outer sheath or covering may be provided that may be adapted to cover a needle-less syringe. The outer sheath may be configured to receive the syringe and to provide a rounded distal end and a nub. An example of an apparatus including a sheath is described below with respect to Figs. 4-10 according to some embodiments. [0015] Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view of an apparatus 400 including a syringe 402 and a sheath 405 including a nub 406 according to some embodiments. The syringe 402 may include a body portion defining the cavity 308 sized to receive a plunger 110 having a rod portion and an end portion 304 that is coupled to a gasket or seal 306. The syringe 402 may further include a flange 404, a hub portion 412, and a nose portion 414. The nose portion 414 may define an opening for fluid passage from a fluid area 410 and the external environment. [0016] The sheath 405 may include a stop portion 422 configured to contact the hub portion 212 of the syringe 402 to seat the syringe 402 within the sheath 405. The sheath may be a substantially cylindrical (or tubular member) defining a cavity sized to receive the syringe 402. The sheath 405 may also include an opening 416 configured to receive the neck portion 414 of the syringe 402. The sheath 405 may further may include a nub 406 that extends outward from a distal end of the sheath 405. The nub 406 may have a rounded, substantially hemispherical, ring, elliptical, or other rounded shape that may partially define the opening 416 that is configured to align with a corresponding opening 108 through the neck portion 414 to allow fluid passage. [0017] In some embodiments, the sheath 405 may be formed from a first material, and the syringe 402 may be formed from a second material. The first material may be more elastic, more malleable, softer, or any combination thereof relative to the second material. In some embodiments, the sheath 405 may have a substantially cylindrical shape without edges and may define an opening on a proximal end that is sized to receive a syringe 402. The sheath 405 may include one or more openings configured to align with an opening on the syringe. Further, in some embodiments, the surface of the sheath 405 may have some texture or uneven areas. Additionally, in some embodiments, the sheath 405 may include an attachment element, such as threads to mate with corresponding threads on an outer surface of a syringe, a flange element configured to mate with a corresponding recess on the syringe, some other attachment structure, or any combination thereof. An example of a sheath that may include an attachment structure is described below with respect to Fig. 5. [0018] Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view 500 of a sheath 505 including a nub 406 and a threaded attachment 502 according to some embodiments. The sheath 505 may define a cavity 504 sized to receive a syringe and may include an opening 508 configured to align to a corresponding opening 408 of a syringe. The sheath 505 further may include an attachment feature 502. In the illustrated example, the attachment feature 502 may be threads configured to fit corresponding threads on an exterior surface of the syringe. The user may turn the syringe within the cavity 504 in order to secure the sheath 505 to the syringe. [0019] In some embodiments, the size of the opening 416 may be sufficiently narrow to apply a hoop stress on the neck portion 414 of the syringe 402 to secure the sheath 505 to the syringe. In some embodiments, an extension on an inner surface of the sheath 505 may be configured to mate with a corresponding recess on an exterior surface of the syringe to secure the sheath 505 to the syringe. [0020] In some embodiments, the sheath 505 may be formed from a medical grade silicone. In some embodiments, the sheath 505 may be formed from a medical device material, such as a polymer designed to support medical applications and to maintain its material properties even after sterilization. In some embodiments, the sheath 505 may be formed from a flexible, substantially malleable material that may be of a different material from that of the syringe. [0021] Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view 600 of a sheath 605 including a nub 406 and a threaded attachment 502 according to some embodiments. The sheath 605 defines a cavity 504 sized to receive a syringe and may include a threaded feature 502 configured to mate with a corresponding feature on an outside surface of the syringe to secure the syringe within the sheath 605. The sheath 605 may include a nub 406 that extends from a distal end 602 of the sheath 605. The sheath 605 may include openings 204 about a periphery of the nub 406. [0022] Fig. 7 is a front view 700 of a distal end 602 of the sheath 605 of Fig. 6 according to some embodiments. The distal end 602 may include openings 204 and nub 406. While the openings 204 are distributed around the nub 406 of the distal end 602 approximately midway between the nub 406 and the peripheral edge of the distal end 602, in some embodiments, the openings 204 may be positioned closer to the peripheral edge or closer to the nub 406. Further, in some embodiments, additional openings or fewer openings may be provided. One possible example of a distal end that may include an additional opening is described below with respect to Fig. 8. [0023] Fig. 8 is a front view 800 of a distal end 602 of a sheath, similar to the sheath 605 of Fig. 6, according to some embodiments. The front view 800 may include the opening 108 that extends through a center of the nub 406 in addition to the openings 204. [0024] In some embodiments, the nub 406 may be positioned at approximately a center of the distal end 602. In some embodiments, the nub 406 may be offset from a center of the distal end 602. The opening 108 may be aligned to a longitudinal axis of a syringe. [0025] Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view 900 of a sheath 905 including a nub 406 according to some embodiments. The sheath 905 may include multiple layers including an outer layer 902 and an inner layer 904. The sheath 905 may define an opening 504 sized to receive a syringe. The outer layer 902 may include the nub 406. In some embodiments, the inner layer 904 and the outer layer 902 may cooperate to form the nub 406. In some embodiments, the inner layer 904 may be formed from a first material and the outer layer 902 may be formed form a second material. In some embodiments, the first material may be more rigid than the second material. [0026] While the illustrated example of Fig. 9 depicts the inner layer extending from the opening of the proximal end along its entire length to the opening of the distal end 602, in some embodiments, the inner layer may extend only a portion of the length of the sheath 905. One possible example of a sheath having an inner layer that extends for only a portion of the length of the sheath is described below with respect to Fig. 10. [0027] Fig. 10 is a cross-sectional view 1000 of a sheath 1005 including a nub 406 according to some embodiments. The sheath 1005 may include multiple layers including a first layer 1002 that extends about an entire periphery of the sheath 1005. The sheath 1005 may further include an inner layer 1004 that extends over a portion of an interior surface of the sheath 1005. In some embodiments, the inner layer 1004 may extend over the stop portion 422 of the sheath 1005, providing a relatively rigid seat against which the syringe may be positioned without over-stressing the distal end 602 of the sheath 1005. [0028] In some embodiments, the nub 406 may include an opening that extends therethrough, and the nub 406 may be positioned at approximately a center of the distal end 602. In some embodiments, the nub 406 may be offset from a center axis of the sheath 1005. In some embodiments, the nub 406 may extend at least partially over the opening 108 to prevent the fluid from dispensing in a direct stream out of the opening 108, and dispersing the fluid over a larger spray area than a fluid stream would otherwise provide. [0029] While the embodiments described above included a syringe with a nub and a sheath with a nub, in some embodiments, the nub may be provided on a cap configured to fit onto a distal end of a syringe. Examples of such embodiments are described below with respect to Figs. 11-14. [0030] Fig. 11 is a side view of an apparatus 1100 including a syringe 102 and a cap 1102 including a nub 1106 according to some embodiments. The syringe 102 may include the plunger 110 and the flange 104. The syringe 102 may further include a hub portion 412 and a neck portion 1110 that extends from the hub portion 412 and through which the opening 108 may extend. The syringe 104 may further include an attachment feature 1 104 configured to mate with a corresponding attachment feature of the cap 1102. [0031] In some embodiments, the cap 1102 may be a substantially cylindrical shape (or tubular shape) having a rounded end that may include a nub 1106 and an opening 1108 that extends through the cap 1102. The cap 1102 may include an attachment feature on an interior surface of the cap 1102 that may be configured to couple to the attachment feature 1104 on the syringe 102 to secure the cap 1102 to the syringe 102. In some embodiments, the cap 1102 may include an opening 1108 configured to align to the opening 108 of the neck 1110 of the syringe 102. [0032] Fig. 12 is a cross-sectional view 1200 of the cap 1102 of Fig. 11 including an attachment mechanism 1202 according to some embodiments. The attachment mechanism 1202 may be configured to mate with a corresponding recess 1104 of the syringe 102 in a manner that may be similar to a pen cap coupling to a pen. In some embodiments, the attachment feature 1202 may be a flange or other structure that extends from an inner surface of the cap 1102. In some embodiments, the attachment feature 1202 may extend about an entire inner circumference of the cap 1102. In some embodiments, the attachment feature 1202 may extend about a portion of the inner circumference of the cap 1102. [0033] Fig. 13 is a cross-sectional view 1300 of the cap 1102 of Fig. 11 including an attachment mechanism 1302 according to some embodiments. In some embodiments, the attachment mechanism 1302 may be located at a stop portion of the cap 1102. In some embodiments, the attachment mechanism 1302 may be located within an opening 1108 of the cap 1102. The attachment mechanism 1302 may be a threaded portion configured to mate with a corresponding threaded portion of a syringe to secure the cap 1102 to the syringe. [0034] While the cap 1102 depicted in Figs. 11-13 may include the opening 1108 located at a center of the rounded end of the cap 1102, it should be appreciated that, in some embodiments, the opening 1108 may be offset from a center axis of the cap 1102. In some embodiments, the cap 1102 may include multiple openings as described below with respect to Fig. 14. [0035] Fig. 14 is a side view 1400 of a cap 1102 configured to couple to a syringe according to some embodiments. The cap 1102 may include a nub 1106 and an opening 1108 that extends through the nub 1106. Additionally, the cap 1102 may include multiple openings 1402, which may be arranged circumferentially about the nub 1106. Within the cap 1102, the openings 1402 may be coupled to an opening 108 of the syringe by conduits extending from the opening 108 to the openings 1402. [0036] Fig. 15 is a flow diagram of a method 1500 of forming a sheath configured to receive a syringe according to some embodiments. At 1502, an apparatus may be formed that may include an open proximal end and a distal end including a rounded nub and that may include a cavity extending from the proximal end to the distal end. Advancing to 1504, at least one opening is formed that extends from the cavity through the distal end. Continuing to 1506, an attachment feature may be optionally machined on a surface of the apparatus configured to mate with a corresponding attachment feature of another component. In some embodiments, the apparatus may be a syringe having a nub, and the attachment feature may include a recess configured to mate with a flange or ridge on an interior surface of a cap or sheath (the other component) that also may include a nub. In some embodiments, the apparatus may be a sheath or cap that is configured to couple to a corresponding attachment feature on a syringe. In some embodiments, the sheath and the syringe may include a nub. In some embodiments, the sheath may include a nub, and the syringe may include a neck portion that extends at least partially toward the nub. [0037] Fig. 16A is a side-view of a syringe 1600 including multiple openings, in accordance with certain embodiments of the present disclosure. The syringe 1600 may include a body portion 1602 having a flange 1604. The body portion 1602 may define a cavity sized to receive a rode portion 1606 of a plunger 1608. The body portion 1602 may further include one or more openings 1610 at a distal end opposite the flange 1604. The one or more openings 1610 may extend from an exterior surface through the distal end of the body portion and into the internal cavity. In some embodiments, the number, the spacing, the shape, and the interior dimensions of the openings 1610 may vary to provide a desired diffusion for fluid disbursed through the openings 1610. [0038] Fig. 16B is a cross-sectional view 1620 of the syringe 1600 of Fig. 16A taken along line A- A, in accordance with certain embodiments of the present disclosure. The syringe 1600 further includes a seal 1622 configured to fit over a tip of the rod portion 1606 of the plunger 1608 to form a fluid seal against the interior surface of the cavity of the body portion 1602 in order to push fluid toward and through the openings 1610. In the cross-sectional view, a central opening 1624 is shown, which may be formed at a substantially central position in the distal end of the body portion 1602 (opposite end from the flange 1604). [0039] Fig. 17 is an exploded view 1700 and a perspective view 1720 of the syringe 1600 of Fig. 16A, in accordance with certain embodiments of the present disclosure. The exploded view 1700 includes the seal 1622. Further, the exploded view 1700 includes the rod portion 1606 of the plunger 1608. The rod portion 1606 includes an end 1702 sized to fit into an opening of the seal 1622. The rod portion 1606 may further include a flange portion 1702 sized to engage an interior surface of the seal 1622 and may further include a stopper portion 1704 configured to engage a portion of the seal 1622 to prevent over stressing. In some embodiments, the seal 1622 may be installed onto the end 1702 and may be pushed over the flange portion 1702 to engage the stopper portion 1704. The flange portion 1702 may engage an interior portion of the seal 1622 to secure the seal 1622 to the rod portion 1606. [0040] Fig. 18A is a front view 1800 of the syringe 1600 of Fig. 16A, in accordance with certain embodiments of the present disclosure. The front view 1800 depicts the plunger 1608, the flange 1604, and the body portion 1602. The body portion 1602 includes the openings 1610 and the central opening 1624. In the illustrated example, the openings 1610 and 1624 are approximately the same size and shape. However, in other embodiments, the openings 1610 may be a different size and shape as compared to the central opening 1624. In some embodiments, instead of being arranged in a circular formation around the central opening 1624, the openings 1624 may be arranged in a different configuration.

[0048] Figs 21A-21D are front views of the syringe of Fig. 19A, in accordance with certain embodiments of the present disclosure. Referring now to Fig. 21 A, a front view 2100 of the syringe 1900 of Fig. 19A is shown. The front view 2100 includes the body portion 1902, the flange 1904, the plunger 1908 and the nub 106. The nub 106 may include an opening 2102 having an irregular shape, such as a barbell type of shape or another shape. [0049] Fig. 2 IB depicts a front view 2120 of the syringe 1900 of Fig. 19A including an opening 2122 having an irregular shape that is substantially rectangular-shaped. In some embodiments, the rectangular- shaped opening 2122 may provide a non-uniform dispersal of fluid. [0050] Fig. 21C depicts a front view 2140 of the syringe 1900 of Fig. 19A including an opening 2142 having an irregular shape that is substantially hourglass-shaped. In some embodiments, the hourglass-shaped opening 2142 may provide a non-uniform dispersal of fluid. [0051] Fig. 21D depicts a front view 2160 of the syringe 1900 of Fig. 19A including an opening 2162 having an irregular shape that is substantially diamond-shaped. In some embodiments, the diamond-shaped opening 2162 may provide a non-uniform dispersal of fluid. [0052] Fig. 22A is a cross-sectional view 2200 of the syringe 1900 of Fig. 19A including an opening 2204. In some embodiments, the opening 2204 may define a cylindrically- shaped fluid passage extending from the cavity within the body portion 1902 through the nub 106. The cross-sectional view 2200 further depicts the rod portion 1906 of the plunger 1908 extending within the cavity of the body portion 1902. Further, the rod portion 1906 may include an end portion 2222, a flange portion 2224, and a stop portion 2226. Further, a seal 2202 may be coupled to the end portion 2222 and may be configured to provide a fluid seal extending a full internal diameter of the cavity to push fluid toward the opening as the plunger 1908 is pushed toward the distal end of the body portion 1902. [0053] Fig. 22B is a cross-sectional view 2220 of a portion of the syringe 1900 including the opening 2204 having a substantially cylindrical fluid passage that extends from an external surface of the nub 106 to a cavity defined by the hub portion of the syringe 1900. In the illustrated example, the rod portion 1906 is fully inserted within the cavity such that the seal 2202 is in contact with the interior surface of the distal end of the body portion 1902. [0054] Fig. 22C is a cross-sectional view 2240 of a portion of the syringe 1900 including an opening 2242 defining a fluid passage having a varying internal diameter. In the illustrated example, the varying internal diameter may form a Venturi tube type of passage having a narrow portion toward the middle of the passage and a wider portion at the opening to provide reduced pressure and increased dispersion. [0055] Fig. 22D is a cross-sectional view 2260 of a portion of the syringe 1900 including an opening 2262 defining a fluid passage. Within the opening 2262, the syringe 1900 may include an obstruction element 2264 configured to diffuse or otherwise disperse fluid that may be pushed through the opening 2262 by the plunger 1908 via the rod portion 1906 and the seal 2202. [0056] In some embodiments, the shape of the opening, the shape of the fluid passage, or any combination thereof may be selected to provide a desired fluid dispersion at a distal end of the syringe. In some embodiments, the external diameter and length of the syringe may be selected to provide a suitable insertion vessel through which the fluid may be presented. For in vitro fertilization, for example, the vagina extends from the vulva to the uterus, and the length of the vagina may vary from about 2.75 inches to about 4.75 inches. Accordingly, the length of the syringe may be selected to be a suitable length for a particular woman. For in vitro fertilization purposes, the body portion of the syringe (from the distal end to the flange) may be approximately 2.75 to 3 inches in length. Other lengths may also be possible. [0057] In conjunction with Figs. 1-22D, an apparatus is described that may include a sheath or body portion having a distal end having a rounded nub and at least one opening. In some embodiments, the at least one opening may include a non-circular or irregular shaped opening, such as a slit, an hourglass shape, a barbell shape, a diamond shape, another shape, or any combination thereof. The distal end of the apparatus may be rounded to present a blunt or "edgeless" end presenting a substantially smooth transition from an elongate portion to a distal portion of the apparatus. In some embodiments, the apparatus may be used for home -based artificial insemination, such as by insertion of the apparatus into the vagina of a woman until the nub contacts the woman's cervix. The plunger may then be depressed to expel seminal fluid onto the cervix through the opening to provide artificial insemination. [0058] In some embodiments, the apparatus may include a syringe having a substantially tubular shape and having a substantially rounded distal end. The syringe may further include a rounded nub extending from the distal end proximate to a longitudinal axis of the syringe. In some embodiments, the rounded nub may include the opening to allow fluid to pass therethrough. In some embodiments, the distal end may include a plurality of openings to allow fluid passage. In some embodiments, the opening or openings in the rounded nub, the other openings at the distal end, or any combination thereof may have a non-circular or irregular shapes to diffuse the fluid as it passes through the one or more openings. [0059] In some embodiments, the apparatus may include a syringe and a sheath having a cavity sized to receive the syringe. The sheath may include one or more openings on a distal end that are configured to align with (or mate with) a fluid opening of the syringe. In some embodiments, the sheath may include an attachment feature configured to mate with a corresponding feature on the syringe. In an example, the attachment feature may include threads configured to mate with corresponding threads of the syringe to secure the syringe within the sheath. In another example, the attachment mechanism may include a raised edge on one of an interior surface of the sheath and an exterior surface of the syringe that is configured to mate with a corresponding recess on the other of the exterior surface of the syringe and the interior surface of the sheath. Further, in some embodiments, at least a portion of the sheath may be formed from a first material, and at least a portion of the syringe may be formed from a second material. In some embodiments, the first material may be more flexible or malleable than the second material. [0060] In some embodiments, a cap or partial sheath may be configured to mate with a syringe to provide a rounded end having a nub and including one or more openings for fluid passage. In some embodiments, the nub may be rounded and may include an opening configured to align to an opening of the syringe to allow fluid from the syringe to pass therethrough. The opening of the cap or partial sheath may be irregular in shape (e.g., oval, elliptical, hourglass shaped, barbell shaped, rectangular shaped, or some other shape). In some embodiments, the cap or partial sheath may include an attachment feature configured to mate with a corresponding feature of the syringe to secure the cap or partial sheath to the syringe. In some embodiments, the syringe may be formed from a first material, and the cap or partial sheath may be formed from a second material. The first material may be more rigid than the second material.
