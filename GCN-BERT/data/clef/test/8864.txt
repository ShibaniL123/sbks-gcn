CROSS REFRENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION The present invention claims priority of the provisional patent application No. 61981578 filed on Apr. 18, 2014; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention generally relates to an apparatus for measuring biological parameters of a user, and more particularly relates to the apparatus for sensing the physiology of the body and controlling the compression level of the user. The apparatus is worn by the user. 2. Description of Related Art Fabrics in the art are known with intelligence capabilities. Such fabrics have embedded conductive elements to monitor vital signs of the body of the user. Typical methods include interweaving of the conductive elements into the fabric. Such fabrics for obtaining the physiological data should be in contact with the skin of the user. Various socks are used for measuring the pressure distribution around the foot of diabetic patients. The metallic fibers are connected to an electronic circuit which computes the pressure distribution from the electrical resistances at the intersection between the metallic fibers. However, these socks do not measure the physiological data precisely and lacks display unit for displaying the physiological data measured from the user. It has been found that the pressure sensors known in the art do not allow precise measurement of a sensed pressure over a sufficiently wide range due to lack of contraction forces. Such wearable devices lack buttons to control compression force. Further, it has been found that the fabric sensing devices in the art are of fixed size so it became difficult for bulky user to use that device. Devices in the art are heavy and big in size so it is difficult to carry those devices. Therefore there is a need of an apparatus wearable by the user for sensing the physiological parameters of user and monitor heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure data, body temperature, breathing rate. Further, the apparatus should display the sensed physiological parameters and furthermore contain at least one button to control the contraction forces. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, wearable apparatus for measuring physiological activities of a user is provided. An object of the present invention is to provide a wearable apparatus for measuring physiological activities of the user.

The ring control center includes one or more sensors for measuring the physiological activities of the user, one or more compression control buttons for controlling the compression force of the housing on the user, a display unit for displaying the value of the measured physiological activities received from the one or more sensors. Another object of the present invention is to provide the ring control center with the blood pressure button for measuring the blood pressure of the user through the one or more sensors. In yet another object of the present invention is to provide a communication unit for sharing the vital information received from the one or more sensors with an external device.

The electrically conductive material is a silver yarn or a yarn coated with silver. Various commercially available silver yarns are useful for creating the housing 102 of the present invention. The housing 102 is made up of a material that allows variable compression force. In a preferred embodiment, the housing 102 is made up of silver yarn. The silver yarn comprises 99.9% pure elemental silver and is highly electrically conductive, lightweight, flexible, stretchable, washable, and durable. In addition, the silver yarn may be of a broad spectrum antimicrobial and odor eliminator useful in the care of wounds such as dermal ulcers. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the housing 102 may be made of conductive material such as a copper wire knit and blended with materials such as nylon, cotton, spandex, and natural rubber. Further, the housing 102 provides greater comfort for the user. In a preferred embodiment, the shape of the housing is of a sock. However, it would be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that various shapes of the housing 102 may also be envisioned such as for gloves, wrist band etc without deviating from the scope of the present invention. The housing 102 may further be made in various shape and sizes to cater all types of leg, arm and wrist.
