This invention relates to a novel dosage for aclidinium and to novel methods and formulations for the treatment of respiratory diseases, especially asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), using aclidinium. BACKGROUND Aclidinium bromide is 3(R)-(2-hydroxy-2,2-dithien-2-ylacetoxy)-1-(3-phenoxypropyl)-1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bromide, described in, e.g., WO 0104118. Although this compound is known to be a long-acting anticholinergic useful in the treatment of respiratory diseases, the optimal dosage is not disclosed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is now surprisingly found that, for treatment of respiratory disorders, particularly asthma and COPD, in an adult human, aclidinium is most effective upon administration by inhalation in a dosage of about 200 micrograms per metered nominal dose, typically a single dosage of about 200 micrograms per day metered nominal dose, (e.g., about 180 micrograms emitted dose, and about 60 micrograms Fine Particle dose) (weight corresponding to aclidinium bromide). The invention thus provides in a first embodiment a pharmaceutical composition for inhalation comprising aclidinium in the form of a dry powder of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g., aclidinium bromide, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable dry powder carrier, e.g., lactose particles, (i) comprising a single metered nominal dose of aclidinium equivalent to about 200 micrograms aclidinium bromide, or (ii) in a multidose dry powder inhaler device calibrated to provide a metered nominal dose of aclidinium equivalent to about 200 micrograms aclidinium bromide. This composition can be administered one or more times per day. Preferably once or twice a day. In a second embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a respiratory condition, e.g., selected from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in a patient in need of such treatment, comprising administering a dose, typically a single daily dose or twice daily dose, of aclidinium, e.g., aclidinium bromide, equivalent to about 200 micrograms metered nominal dose aclidinium bromide, e.g., comprising administering a pharmaceutical composition according to the previous paragraph. The invention further provides the use of aclidinium in the manufacture of a medicament, e.g., as described in the preceding paragraph, for use in such a method. The aclidinium may be administered as monotherapy, or in combination with one or more additional anti-inflammatory and/or bronchodilating agents, e.g., corticosteroids, PDE IV inhibitors and β2-agonists, e.g., formoterol, salmeterol, budesonide, and mometasone, and the invention thus further provides methods as described above further comprising administration of an effective amount of such an agent, as well as pharmaceutical compositions as described above, further comprising such additional agent(s). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Typically, the aclidinium is administered in the form of a salt with an anion X, wherein X is a pharmaceutically acceptable anion of a mono or polyvalent acid. More typically, X is an anion derived from an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid, or an organic acid such as methanesulphonic acid, acetic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid or maleic acid. Preferably the aclidinium is in the form of aclidinium bromide. The aclidinium is preferably administered in the form of a dry powder, in admixture with a suitable carrier, e.g., lactose powder, suitable for inhalation. For example, in one embodiment, the aclidinium is aclidinium bromide in admixture with lactose powder. The respiratory disease or condition to be treated with the formulations and methods of the present invention is typically asthma, acute or chronic bronchitis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchial hyperreactivity or rhinitis, in particular asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially COPD. In the context of dosage of an active agent, "about" as used herein means within the normal limits of acceptable variations as defined by the European and US Pharmacopeia of plus/minus 35% or preferably acceptable variations as defined by the current most stringent requirement, the US FDA draft guidance for inhaler of plus/minus 25% or especially within the metered dosing accuracy for the dispensing system e.g. +/- 10% Thus a metered nominal dose of "about 200 micrograms" is meant a target dose of 200 micrograms subject to variation within the normal limits of acceptance for the dispensing system, e.g. plus/minus 35% (acceptable variations as defined by the European and US Pharmacopeia) or preferably 150-250 micrograms (or acceptable variations as defined by the current most stringent requirement, the US FDA draft guidance for inhaler) or especially 170-230 micrograms (or within the metered dosing accuracy of the inhaler). The emitted dose and the fine particle dose (fine particle dose = micrograms aclidinium bromide in the emitted dose below a cut off aerodynamic threshold of 5 micrometer) are subjected to the same variation and proportional to the metered dose and are therefore for the emitted dose e.g. a metered nominal dose of about 200 micrograms (plus/minus 35%) corresponds to about 180 micrograms emitted dose (plus/minus 35%), and about 60 micrograms Fine Particle dose (plus/minus 35%) Packaging of the formulation may be suitable for unit dose or multi-dose delivery. In the case of multi-dose delivery, the formulation can be pre-metered or metered in use. Dry powder inhalers are thus classified into three groups: (a) single dose, (b) multiple unit dose and (c) multi dose devices. Formulations generally contain a powder mix for inhalation of the compounds of the invention and a suitable powder base (carrier substance) such as lactose or starch. Use of lactose is preferred. Each capsule or cartridge may generally contain between 2µg and 400 µg of each therapeutically active ingredient. Alternatively, the active ingredient (s) may be presented without excipients. For single dose inhalers of the first type, single doses have been weighed by the manufacturer into small containers, which are mostly hard gelatine capsules. A capsule has to be taken from a separate box or container and inserted into a receptacle area of the inhaler. Next, the capsule has to be opened or perforated with pins or cutting blades in order to allow part of the inspiratory air stream to pass through the capsule for powder entrainment or to discharge the powder from the capsule through these perforations by means of centrifugal force during inhalation. After inhalation, the emptied capsule has to be removed from the inhaler again. Mostly, disassembling of the inhaler is necessary for inserting and removing the capsule, which is an operation that can be difficult and burdensome for some patients. Other drawbacks related to the use of hard gelatine capsules for inhalation powders are (a) poor protection against moisture uptake from the ambient air, (b) problems with opening or perforation after the capsules have been exposed previously to extreme relative humidity, which causes fragmentation or indenture, and (c) possible inhalation of capsule fragments. Moreover, for a number of capsule inhalers, incomplete expulsion has been reported. Some capsule inhalers have a magazine from which individual capsules can be transferred to a receiving chamber, in which perforation and emptying takes place, as described in WO 92/03175. Other capsule inhalers have revolving magazines with capsule chambers that can be brought in line with the air conduit for dose discharge (e. g. WO91/02558 and GB 2242134). They comprise the type of multiple unit dose inhalers together with blister inhalers, which have a limited number of unit doses in supply on a disk or on a strip. Blister inhalers provide better moisture protection of the medicament than capsule inhalers. Access to the powder is obtained by perforating the cover as well as the blister foil, or by peeling off the cover foil. When a blister strip is used instead of a disk, the number of doses can be increased, but it is inconvenient for the patient to replace an empty strip. Therefore, such devices are often disposable with the incorporated dose system, including the technique used to transport the strip and open the blister pockets. Multi-dose inhalers do not contain pre-measured quantities of the powder formulation. They consist of a relatively large container and a dose measuring principle that has to be operated by the patient. The container bears multiple doses that are isolated individually from the bulk of powder by volumetric displacement. Various dose measuring principles exist, including rotatable membranes (e. g. EP0069715) or disks (e. g. GB 2041763; EP 0424790; DE 4239402 and EP 0674533), rotatable cylinders (e. g. EP 0166294; GB 2165159 and WO 92/09322) and rotatable frustums (e. g. WO 92/00771), all having cavities which have to be filled with powder from the container. Other multi dose devices have measuring slides (e. g.US 5201308 and WO 97/00703) or measuring plungers with a local or circumferential recess to displace a certain volume of powder from the container to a delivery chamber or an air conduit e. g. EP 0505321, WO 92/04068 and WO 92/04928. Reproducible dose measuring is one of the major concerns for multi dose inhaler devices. The powder formulation has to exhibit good and stable flow properties, because filling of the dose measuring cups or cavities is mostly under the influence of the force of gravity. For reloaded single dose and multiple unit dose inhalers, the dose measuring accuracy and reproducibility can be guaranteed by the manufacturer. Multi dose inhalers on the other hand, can contain a much higher number of doses, whereas the number of handlings to prime a dose is generally lower. Because the inspiratory air stream in multi-dose devices is often straight across the dose measuring cavity, and because the massive and rigid dose measuring systems of multi dose inhalers can not be agitated by this inspiratory air stream, the powder mass is simply entrained from the cavity and little de-agglomeration is obtained during discharge. Consequently, separate disintegration means are necessary. However in practice, they are not always part of the inhaler design. Because of the high number of doses in multi- dose devices, powder adhesion onto the inner walls of the air conduits and the de- agglomeration means must be minimized and/or regular cleaning of these parts must be possible, without affecting the residual doses in the device. Some multi dose inhalers have disposable drug containers that can be replaced after the prescribed number of doses has been taken (e. g. WO 97/000703). For such semi-permanent multi dose inhalers with disposable drug containers, the requirements to prevent drug accumulation are even stricter. In a preferred embodiment, the aclidinium is administered via a breath-activated, multidose, dry powder inhaler, calibrated to permit daily dosing of 200 micrograms metered nominal dose of aclidinium. An especially preferred inhaler device for this purpose is Genuair®, (formerly known as Novolizer SD2FL), or as described in WO 97/000703, WO 03/000325, or WO 03/061742, the contents of which applications are incorporated herein by reference. Apart from applications through dry powder inhalers the compositions of the invention can be administered in aerosols which operate via propellant gases or by means of so-called atomisers or nebulizers, via which solutions or suspensions of pharmacologically-active substances can be sprayed under high pressure so that a mist of inhalable particles results. Medicaments for administration by inhalation desirably have a controlled particle size. The optimum particle size for inhalation into the bronchial system is usually 1-10µm, preferably 2-5µm. Particles having a size above 20µ are generally too large when inhaled to reach the small airways. To achieve these particle sizes the particles of the active ingredient as produced may be size reduced by conventional means eg by micronisation or supercritical fluid techniques. The desired fraction may be separated out by air classification or sieving. Preferably, the particles will be crystalline. Achieving a high dose reproducibility with micronised powders is difficult because of their poor flowability and extreme agglomeration tendency. To improve the efficiency of dry powder compositions, the particles should be large while in the inhaler, but small when discharged into the respiratory tract. Thus, an excipient, for example a mono-, di- or polysaccharide or sugar alcohol, e.g., such as lactose, mannitol or glucose is generally employed. The particle size of the excipient will usually be much greater than the inhaled medicament within the present invention. When the excipient is lactose it will typically be present as lactose particles, preferably crystalline alpha lactose monohydrate, e.g., having an average particle size range of 20-1000 µm, preferably in the range of 90-150 µm. The median particle size approximately corresponds to the average and is the diameter where 50 mass-% of the particles have a larger equivalent diameter, and the other 50 mass-% have a smaller equivalent diameter. Hence the average particle size is generally referred to in the art as equivalent d50. The distribution of particle size around may affect flow properties, bulk density, etc. Hence to characterize a particle size diameter, other equivalent diameters can be used in addition to d50, such as d10 and d90. d10 is the equivalent diameter where 10 mass-% of the particles have a smaller diameter (and hence the remaining 90% is coarser). d90 is the equivalent diameter where 90 mass-% of the particles have a smaller diameter. In one embodiment, the lactose particles for use in formulations of the invention have a d10 of 90 - 160 µm, a d50 of 170 - 270 µm, and d90 of 290 - 400 µm. Suitable lactose materials for use in the present invention are commercially available, e.g., from DMW Internacional (Respitose GR-001, Respitose SV-001, Respitose SV-003); Meggle (Capsulac 60, Inhalac 70, Capsulac 60 INH); and Borculo Domo (Lactohale 100-200, Lactohale 200-300, and Lactohale 100-300). The ratio between the lactose particles and the aclidinium by weight will depend on the inhaler device used, but is typically, e.g., 5:1 to 200:1, for example 50:1 to 150:1, e.g., 60-70:1. In a preferred embodiment, the aclidinium is administered in the form of a dry powder formulation of aclidinium bromide in admixture with lactose, in a ratio by weight of aclidinium to lactose of 1:100 to 1:150, suitable for administration via a dry powder inhaler, wherein the aclidinium particles have an average particle size of from 2 to 5µm in diameter, e.g., less than 3 µm in diameter, and the lactose particles have have a d10 of 90 - 160 µm, a d50 of 170 - 270 µm, and d90 of 290 - 400 µm. Additional active agents such as β2-agonists, PDE IV inhibitors, corticosteroids, leukotriene D4 antagonists, inhibitors of egfr-kinase, p38 kinase inhibitors or NK1 receptor agonists may be utilized in the methods and formulations of the inventions.

EXAMPLE 1 Methods: Patients with moderate to severe stable COPD were randomized to receive double-blind, once-daily treatment with aclidinium (25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 µg), placebo, or open-label tiotropium 18 µg for 4 weeks. Spirometric measurements were performed at 22-24 h after the first dose and then at weekly intervals, and from 0.5-6 h post-administration on Day 1 and at Week 4 (Day 29). Results: The ITT population included 460 patients. Aclidinium dose-dependently increased trough FEV1 on Day 29 (table).

Time to peak FEV1 was achieved at 3 h post-dose for aclidinium 100-400 µg. Aclidinium was well tolerated, with no dose-dependent effect on ECG, laboratory parameters or adverse events. Conclusion: Aclidinium produced sustained bronchodilation over 24 h and was well tolerated. Aclidinium 200 and 400 µg had comparable bronchodilatory effects to open-label tiotropium 18 µg. Based on the efficacy and tolerability data, aclidinium 200 µg was selected as the investigational dose for a future long-term clinical trial in COPD.
