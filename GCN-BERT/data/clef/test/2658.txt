Step 2: 4-chloro-5-iodoisoindolin-1-one
4-chloro-5-aminoisoindolin-1-one (2.58 g, 14 mmol) was added to 15 mL of 2M sulfuric acid, and cooled in an ice bath. A solution of sodium nitrite (0.97 g, 28 mmol) in water (1.5 mL) was added dropwise, and stirred at low temperature for 30 mins. Potassium iodide (11.62 g, 70 mmol) was added, stirred in an ice bath for 2 hours, and then stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The resulting mixture was extracted with dichloromethane, and the organic phase was washed with water and then brine. After concerntration, the product 4-chloro-5-iodoisoindolin-1-one (2.48 g) was obtained by silica gel column chromatography. Yield: 60%.
