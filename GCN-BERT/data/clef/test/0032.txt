4. Synthesis of Compound 6
(Synthesis of Compound H)
20.0 g of 1-iodonaphthalene, and 240 ml of dehydrated THF were added to a reaction vessel filled with argon, followed by cooling to about −78° C. Then, 108.24 ml of n-butyl lithium, 1.6 M in hexane was added thereto dropwise. After finishing dropping, stirring was continued for about 1 hour. Then, 37.75 mL of dichlorodiphenylsilane was added thereto dropwise. After finishing dropping, the solution temperature was gradually elevated back to room temperature, and stirring was continued for about 2 hours. The solution thus obtained was referred to as solution “h”.
To a separate reaction vessel, 24.56 g of 4,4'-dibromobiphenyl, 240 mL of dehydrated THF were added, followed by cooling to −78° C. Then, 49.20 mL of n-butyl lithium, 1.6 M in hexane was added dropwise. After finishing dropping, stirring was continued for about 1 hour. The solution “h” was added thereto dropwise, and the solution temperature was elevated back to room temperature, followed by stirring for about 2 hours. Water was added for quenching, and extraction was performed with ethyl acetate. An organic layer was separated, and solvents were distilled. The crude product thus obtained was separated using silica gel column chromatography (using hexane and toluene) to obtain 17.05 g (yield 40%) of Compound H as a white solid compound.
The molecular weight of Compound E measured by FAB-MS was 540.
