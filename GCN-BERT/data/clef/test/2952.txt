TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a novel chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight and use thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight which has utilization as an inhibitor of peritoneal disorder caused by long-term use of a peritoneal dialysis fluid containing glucose or a polysaccharide thereof as an osmotic agent, utilization as an osmotic agent in a peritoneal dialysis fluid, and the like, and use thereof. BACKGROUND ART Artificial dialysis for patients with end-stage renal failure is broadly divided into hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Among these, the peritoneal dialysis is a method in which a hypertonic dialysis fluid containing glucose or a polysaccharide thereof as an osmotic agent is injected into the peritoneal cavity and excess waste products, water, and electrolytes in the body are removed with the use of the function of the peritoneum as a semipermeable membrane. The peritoneal dialysis has many advantages as compared with the hemodialysis in that the need for dietary or activity restriction is lower, the effect on hemodynamics is lower, preservation of residual renal function is better, rehabilitation is easier, etc. However, in recent years, various disorders due to prolonged peritoneal dialysis, for example, poor water removal or insufficient removal of waste products accompanying deterioration of peritoneal function has become a serious problem. The deterioration of peritoneal function is deeply associated with an advanced glycation end product (AGE) generated by a reaction between glucose contained in a peritoneal dialysis fluid as an osmotic agent and a protein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by binding of AGE to a cell having a receptor thereof or exposure of the cell to high concentration of glucose. In order to solve the problems as described above, a search for a substance that inhibits deterioration of peritoneal function caused by glucose or a polysaccharide thereof and a search for a novel osmotic agent alternative to glucose or a polysaccharide thereof have been performed, and a chondroitin sulfate (CS) which is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan has already been proposed as a candidate substance (For example, Patent Document 1 and Non-patent Document 1). Patent Document 1: JP-A-1-151462Non-patent Document 1: Ohno T., Imada A., “The usefulness of sodium chondroitin sulfate as an osmotic agent for peritoneal dialysis”, Toseki kaishi (The Journal of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy), 30(1): 65, 1997 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Problems that the Invention is to Solve A chondroitin sulfate is a substance in the body and therefore has high biocompatibility and little effect on the blood coagulation system unlike heparin. Accordingly, a chondroitin sulfate is considered to be promising also from a safety standpoint. However, although it has been reported that in the evaluation using an animal model, a chondroitin sulfate has an action of protecting the peritoneal function (Non-patent Document 1), it has also been reported that a chondroitin sulfate does not have such a protective action (Suyama K., Kumano K., Sakai T., “Agents preventing decrease in ultrafiltration in a rat model with peritoneal hyperpermeability”, Nippon Jinzo Gakkai Shi (The Japanese Journal of Nephrology), 37(9): 491, 1995). Thus, the current situation is that the views as to the usefulness of a chondroitin sulfate are still controversial. In addition, in the chondroitin sulfate, there are several types based on a difference in the binding site of a sulfate group such as chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate C, chondroitin sulfate D, and chondroitin sulfate E, and also there is significant structural diversity. Therefore, it is considered that functional diversity may arise from the structural diversity, however, as far as the present inventors know, there has been no report that a relationship between the structure and the function of a chondroitin sulfate in peritoneal dialysis is elucidated. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel chondroitin sulfate useful in peritoneal dialysis. Means for Solving the Problems In view of the above points, the present inventors conducted intensive studies, and as a result, they found that a chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight having a specific molecular weight and containing a specific constituent disaccharide unit in a specific percentage of the total is useful as an inhibitor of peritoneal disorder caused by long-term use of a peritoneal dialysis fluid containing glucose or a polysaccharide thereof as an osmotic agent, useful as an osmotic agent in a peritoneal dialysis fluid, and the like, based on excellent action of inhibiting AGE production and action of scavenging reactive oxygen. In a fist embodiment, a chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention completed based on the above findings is characterized by having a weight average molecular weight of from 1000 to 20000 and containing a constituent disaccharide unit represented by the following structural formula in an amount of from 65% to 100% (molar ratio) of the total.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention, which has utilization as an inhibitor of peritoneal disorder caused by long-term use of a peritoneal dialysis fluid containing glucose or a polysaccharide thereof as an osmotic agent, utilization as an osmotic agent in a peritoneal dialysis fluid, and the like, is characterized by having a weight average molecular weight of from 1000 to 20000 and containing a constituent disaccharide unit represented by the following structural formula in an amount of from 65% to 100% (molar ratio) of the total. [in-line-formulae]-[4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(6S)β1]-[/in-line-formulae] (wherein GlcA represents a D-glucuronic acid residue; GalNAc represents an N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue; β1-3 represents a β1-3 glycosidic linkage; β1-4 represents a β1-4 glycosidic linkage; and (6S) indicates that position 6 of the monosaccharide residue is sulfated) The chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention can be prepared by, for example, using chondroitin sulfate C (chondroitin 6-sulfate) containing a constituent disaccharide unit represented by the following structural formula in an amount of from 65% to 100% (molar ratio) of the total as a starting material and reducing the molecular weight of the starting material such that the weight average molecular weight becomes 1000 to 20000, preferably 5000 to 18000. As the chondroitin sulfate C to be used as the starting material, for example, Prionace glauca-derived chondroitin sulfate C (trade name of Seikagaku Corporation: Chondroitin sulfate C, sodium salt (shark cartilage), SG) can be used. The reduction of the molecular weight thereof can be performed by a degradation method using electron beam irradiation described in JP-A-2004-43645 or the like as well as the methods such as a chemical degradation method using hydrochloric acid and an enzymatic degradation method using ovine testicular hyaluronidase which are known methods of reducing the molecular weight of a chondroitin sulfate. Incidentally, the content percentage of the constituent disaccharide unit represented by the following structural formula in the starting material is not necessarily 65% or more (molar ratio) of the total and may be less than 65% (molar ratio) as long as a fraction of 65% or more (molar ratio) can be obtained by fractional purification. Further, the chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention may be a product obtained by chemical synthesis or extraction from a cultured product or a fermented product of a biological tissue of shark or the like. [in-line-formulae]-[4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(6S)β1]-[/in-line-formulae] (wherein GlcA represents a D-glucuronic acid residue; GalNAc represents an N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue; β1-3 represents a β1-3 glycosidic linkage; β1-4 represents a β1-4 glycosidic linkage; and (6S) indicates that position 6 of the monosaccharide residue is sulfated) The chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention has excellent action of inhibiting AGE production and action of scavenging reactive oxygen. Therefore, by adding the chondroitin sulfate to a peritoneal dialysis fluid containing glucose or a polysaccharide thereof as an osmotic agent, an effect as an inhibitor of peritoneal disorder (e.g., lipid peroxidation) caused by glucose or a polysaccharide thereof due to long-term use of such a peritoneal dialysis fluid can be exhibited. Further, the chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention can also be added to a peritoneal dialysis fluid as an osmotic agent in the peritoneal dialysis fluid. In the case where the chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention is added to a conventional peritoneal dialysis fluid containing glucose or a polysaccharide thereof as an osmotic agent, the chondroitin sulfate may be added at a concentration of from 0.01% (w/v) to 1% (w/v). Further, in the case where a peritoneal dialysis fluid is prepared by adding the chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention as an osmotic agent alternative to glucose or a polysaccharide thereof, the chondroitin sulfate may be added at a concentration of from 1% (w/v) to 10% (w/v) to constitute the peritoneal dialysis fluid together with components known as constituent components of the peritoneal dialysis fluid such as sodium, magnesium, calcium, chlorine, and lactic acid. Further, the action of inhibiting AGE production of the chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention is effective in the treatment of diabetes, various diabetic complications (for example, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic vascular complications), etc., and the action of scavenging reactive oxygen of it is effective in the treatment of cancer, cataract, arteriosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, etc. Therefore, the chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention can also be used as an active ingredient for treating such a disease. In this case, the chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention may be administered orally or parenterally at a dose appropriately determined based on the degree of symptoms, age, and body weight of a patient or the like. It can be administered in a known dosage form. EXAMPLES Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to Examples, however, the invention is not limited to the following description. Incidentally, in the Examples, the molecular weight is indicated in “kDa” (1 kDa=1000). Example 1 Preparation of Chondroitin Sulfate Having Decreased Molecular Weight of the Present Invention (1) Prionace glauca-derived chondroitin sulfate C (weight average molecular weight: 30 kDa, trade name of Seikagaku Corporation: Chondroitin sulfate C, sodium salt (shark cartilage), SG) was used as a starting material and dissolved in an amount of 1 g in 50 mL of PBS (pH 5.3). To this solution, 100,000 U of ovine testicular hyaluronidase (manufactured by Sigma, type V) was added, and the enzymatic reaction was allowed to proceed at 37° C. A portion of the reaction mixture was taken over time and analyzed by GPC-HPLC to examine the degree of reduction of the molecular weight. When a desired molecular weight was obtained, the reaction mixture was boiled to stop the enzymatic reaction. In the case where the desired molecular weight was not obtained, ovine testicular hyaluronidase was further added to the reaction mixture and the enzymatic reaction was allowed to proceed. When the desired molecular weight was obtained, the reaction mixture was boiled to stop the enzymatic reaction. After completion of the reaction, activated carbon was added to the thus obtained desired molecular weight fraction, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 50° C. for 1 hour. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was filtered, and to the filtrate, sodium acetate trihydrate was added, and then, ethanol was added thereto to obtain precipitates. The obtained precipitates were purified by washing with ethanol and drying. By the above-mentioned method, a chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention having a weight average molecular weight of 10 kDa and containing a constituent disaccharide unit represented by -[4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(6S)β1]- (wherein GlcA represents a D-glucuronic acid residue; GalNAc represents an N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue; β1-3 represents a β1-3 glycosidic linkage; β1-4 represents a β1-4 glycosidic linkage; and (6S) indicates that position 6 of the monosaccharide residue is sulfated) in an amount of 74.0% (molar ratio) of the total was obtained as white powder (the detail of the composition of the constituent disaccharide is as shown in Table 1). Incidentally, the analysis of the composition of the constituent disaccharide was performed as follows. 100 μL of a measurement sample (about 200 μg/mL) was taken, 40 μL of 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and Chondroitinase ABC (83 mU, manufactured by Seikagaku Corporation) were added thereto, and the total volume was made up to 200 μL.

Example 7 Effect of Protecting Peritoneum in Peritoneal Dialysis of Chondroitin Sulfate Having Decreased Molecular Weight of the Present Invention (Comparison with Known AGE Production Inhibitors) (Experimental Method) To a Wistar male rat at 8 weeks of age, Midpeliq 250 (trade name, a peritoneal dialysis fluid containing glucose at a concentration of 2.5% (w/v) manufactured by Terumo Corporation) in which a test substance was dissolved at a given concentration was repetitively administered into the peritoneal cavity once daily at 15 mL/body for 7 days under ether anesthesia. To a control group (Control), Midpeliq 250 was administered in the same manner. On the next day after the final administration, a peritoneal equilibration test was performed, and the peritoneal function was evaluated. To be more specific, Midpeliq 250 was injected into the peritoneal cavity at 60 mL/kg, and 4 hours thereafter, the fluid remaining in the peritoneal cavity was recovered. The amount of the recovered fluid was measured, and the ultrafiltration capacity (water removal rate) of the peritoneum was evaluated. Further, the concentration of glucose in the recovered fluid was measured, and the peritoneal permeability was evaluated. Incidentally, as the test substance, the following substances were used. (a) A chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention prepared by electron beam irradiation at an irradiation energy of 200 kGy according to the method of Example 2 and having a weight average molecular weight of 10 kDa (CSC 10 kDa), concentration: 0.1% (w/v). (b) Aminoguanidine which is a known AGE production inhibitor, concentration: 0.1% (w/v). (c) Pyridoxamine which is a known AGE production inhibitor, concentration: 0.05% (w/v). (Experimental Results) The results are shown in FIG. 3. As is apparent from FIG. 3, a statistically significant effect of protecting the peritoneum was observed in the chondroitin sulfate having a decreased molecular weight of the present invention having a weight average molecular weight of 10 kDa as compared with the control group, and the effect was higher than that of aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine both of which are known AGE production inhibitors (in the drawing, the expression “Normal” denotes the result in the case where the peritoneal dialysis fluid was not administered).
