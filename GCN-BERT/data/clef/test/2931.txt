Example 51-2 : : Preparation of 2-amino-6-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-(1H)-one (LXXIII)
Ethyl 3-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-3-oxoproanoate (3.41 g, 11.29 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (40 mL). To the resulting solution was added dropwise guanidine carbonate (2.64 g, 14.67 mmol) and the solution was refluxed with heat for 24 hrs. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was diluted with distilled water and neutralized with Conc. HCl to provide a solid. The solid was filtered to give the title compound (3.47 g, 100 %).
