Step 1. 5-Bromo-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine
NaH in mineral oil (510 mg, 13 mmol) was slowly added at 0° C. to a solution of 5-bromo-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (Astatech, 2.1 g, 11 mmol) and [β-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl chloride (2.30 mL, 13 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (25 mL). After stirring at r.t. for 1 h, the reaction mixture was quenched with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure, and the obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (2.5 g, 70%).
