Reference Example 17 Synthesis of tert-butyl 4-(6-chloropyridazin-3-yl)piperazine-1-carboxylate
A solution of 3,6-dichloropyridazine (5.01 g, 33.6 mmol) and tert-butyl piperazine-1-carboxylate (6.88g, 37.0 mmol) in DMF (50 mL) was added triethylamine (11.7 mL, 50.4 mmol) and stirred at 80Â°C overnight. The resultant reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and water was added to the mixture. The mixture was extracted three times with a solvent mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (95:5) (50 mL). The resultant organic phases were combined together and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The resultant solid was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was then concentrated under reduced pressure. The resultant crude product was washed with diethyl ether to yield the title compound (7.0 g, 70%).
