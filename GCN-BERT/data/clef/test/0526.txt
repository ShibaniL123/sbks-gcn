Example 14A
Methyl 6-iodo-3-methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylate
22.4 g (57.5 mmol) of the compound from Example 13A were initially charged together with 28.1 g (86.23 mmol) of cesium carbonate in 224 ml of acetonitrile under argon. 3.6 ml (57.5 mmol) of iodomethane were added at RT. The reaction mixture was warmed to 40° C. and stirred for 1 h. Subsequently, a further 3.6 ml (57.5 mmol) of iodomethane were added, and the mixture was stirred at 40° C. for another 2 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to RT, and ethyl acetate and water were added. The phases were separated, and the organic phase was washed once with saturated sodium carbonate solution. A precipitate was formed, which was filtered off through kieselguhr. The filtrate was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, mobile phase cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 10:1). Drying under reduced pressure gave 12.7 g (55% of theory, 96% purity) of the title compound
