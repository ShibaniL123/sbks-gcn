Example 14
Synthesis of 2-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)pyridin-4(1H)-one
In the same manner as that of Example 1, (1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol (32 mg, 90 µmol), 4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-2-carboxylic acid (28 mg, 0.20 mmol), triethylamine (70 µL, 0.50 mmol), and HATU (114 mg, 0.30 mmol) were reacted. To the reaction solution, a 2 N solution of ammonia in methanol was added to terminate the reaction, then the reaction solution was suspended in saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and the suspension was extracted three times with a 5:1 mixed solution of chloroform and methanol. The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was subjected to preparative TLC using methanol containing 10% concentrated aqueous ammonia and chloroform (concentration, 15%) as the developing solvent to obtain the title compound (8 mg, 20%) as white solid.
