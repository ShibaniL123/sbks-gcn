Step 2. tert-Butyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)cyclobutylcarbamate
To a solution of tert-butyl 3-(3,5-difluorophenyl)cyclobutylcarbamate (3.2 g, 11.29 mmol) in THF (35 mL) at −78° C. was added n-butyllithium, 2.5 M in hexane (13.55 mL, 33.9 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 1 hour before 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (6.3 g, 33.9 mmol) was added dropwise. The resulting solution was stirred at −78° C. for another 1 hour, then warmed up to r.t. and quenched with saturated NH4Cl solution in water (50 mL). The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, and the resulting mixture was washed with brine. The separated organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated in vacuo and obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (2.7 g, 65%).
