Description of Related Art A chainsaw is a traditional electric cutting tool, usually used to trim or cut plants. Generally, the motor of the chainsaw drives the chain to perform cutting. At present, most of the tool products in the market have the brushed motor drive, with the defects of limited service life of the carbon brush, low efficiency (generally about 50%), and because of load and other factors, about 30âˆ¼200Hr service life. Even if the motors of the some products are provided with replaceable carbon brushes to prolong the service life, but, due to the limited service life of the commutator, the carbon brush is useless as long as the motor is replaced once because of expiration of the service life. Besides, the tool products produced by some manufacturers are directly driven by brush-less motors, solving the problem of the service life of the brushed chainsaw. But, the driving tool has a relatively large working torque, and it is needed to greatly increase the motor size to obtain a large torque when the motor performs direct drive, so the defects such as high cost, large weight and large reverse kinetic potential of the brake are generated. Traditional mechanical brake devices have complicated structures, are easily worn to lose efficiency after service for a long time, tend to reduce the braking effect, and have high subsequent maintenance cost.

Refer to figures 1-6. An embodiment of the present invention includes: A brush-less chainsaw comprises a housing 4, a brush-less motor 12, a transmission device 5, an electronic commutator 2, a chain 6, and a chain plate 27. The brush-less motor 12, the transmission device 5, and the electronic commutator 2 are disposed in the housing 25. The brush-less motor 12 is connected with the electronic commutator 2. The power output end of the brush-less motor 12 is connected with the transmission device. In the present invention, the transmission device 5 comprises the brush-less motor 12, a transmission body 15, an output shaft assembly 16, a gearbox cover 17 and a chain wheel 18. The transmission body 15 is fixedly connected to the power output end of the brush-less motor 12. The output shaft assembly 16 is fixedly disposed in a hole in the transmission body 15. The gearbox cover 17 is installed on the transmission body 15. The output end of the brush-less motor 12 is connected with the output shaft assembly 16 through a gear. The output shaft assembly 16 is linked with the chain 6 through the chain wheel 18. Wherein, the tooth profile of the transmission device 5 may be an involute profile or circular arc. The involute teeth may be straight teeth, helical teeth or bevel teeth. The transmission device 5 may be a single-speed change structure, a multi-speed change structure or a step-less speed change structure, confirmed according to the size of the output torque. When the size of the driving wheel 25 is smaller than that of the driven wheel 26, the deceleration function can be conducted; on the contrary, and when the size of the driving wheel 25 is larger than that of the driven wheel 26, the acceleration function can be conducted. The housing 4 is connected with an alarm display device 19; the alarm display device 19 is connected with the brush-less motor 12, the transmission device 5, and the electronic commutator 2. Specifically, the alarm display device 19 may have the display function or alarm function only or have the display and alarm functions, and the fed function may be the working state of all parts of the whole brush-less chainsaw, or the remaining time that the brush-less chainsaw can work. The housing 4 is also connected with a switch trigger 9, a main switch 10, a first microswitch 1, a second microswitch 20, a brake backplate 3 and a lighting switch 21. The switch trigger 9 is linked with the main switch 10. The first microswitch 1 and the second microswitch 20 are linked with the brake backplate 3, which means that the first microswitch 1 and the second microswitch 20 are driven by the brake backplate 3 to switch on or off. The main switch 10, the first microswitch 1, the second microswitch 20 and the lighting switch 21 all are connected to the electronic commutator 2. The housing 4 is also connected with a lateral cover tightening member 7 which fixes the chain 6 at a position with a proper degree of tightness. The chain 6 is driven by the speed governor of the brush-less motor to perform cutting. The housing 4 is internally provided with a power supply 8. The power supply 8 is connected with the electronic commutator 2. The power supply 8 is a DC power supply or an AC power supply, which can be configured upon needs. When the power supply 8 is a DC power supply; the input end of the power supply 8 is connected with a detachable DC power supplier, a detachable portable battery pack or AC/DC transformer; when the power supply 8 is an AC power supply, and the input end of the power supply 8 is connected to the mains supply. The housing 4 is internally provided with an oil pump 14 and an oil kettle 11; one end of the oil pump 14 is connected to the transmission device 5 and the other end is connected with the oil kettle 11. In the present invention, the power supply mode of the electronic commutator 2 is DC power input or AC power input. To reduce the axial length of the brush-less motor 12 and better utilize the inner space of the housing 4 of the chainsaw, in the present invention, the dissipating plane of the electronic commutator 2 is disposed behind the main air inlet or in front of the air outlet such that the air flow generated by the rotation of the brush-less motor 12 passes through the dissipating plane of the electronic commutator 2 to bring the heat away. The dissipating plane of the electronic commutator 2 is disposed behind the main air inlet 22; the air inlet of the brush-less motor 12 is not provided with the main air inlet 22; the housing is internally provided with an air baffle 24 to enclose the brush-less motor 12 and the electronic commutator 2 in a relatively small space (this space has the air input only at the position of the main air inlet 22). During working, cooling fans of the brush-less motor rotate to form negative pressure, and the cooling air goes in from the main air inlet 22, passes through the cooling surface of the electronic commutator 2 to bring away the heat, then enters the air inlet of the motor to take away the heat in the brush-less motor 12, and finally is discharged from the air outlet 23. The control process of the brush-less chainsaw of the present invention comprises the following steps: a. Start control step Start function: when the main switch 10 is closed, the electronic commutator 2 detects the position signal of a hall sensor on the brush-less motor 12 and gives a corresponding control signal to control current to pass through the three-phase coil on the brush-less motor 12 in turn, thus realizing the efficiency rotation of the brush-less motor 12 and driving the chain 6 to rotate to fulfill the aim of cutting; and when the main switch 10 is released, the brush-less motor 12 can slow down freely. b. Brake control step The brake backplate 3 rotates to transmit the brake signal to the electronic commutator 2, and the microswitch 20 cuts off the power supply 8 of the brush-less motor 12 at the same time; the electronic commutator 2 short-circuits the coil of the brush-less motor 12 to realize the quick stopping of the brush-less motor 12, and the alarm display device 19 sounds or displays an alarm to the client. The braking mode provided in the present invention utilizes the energy consumption mode of the coil of the brush-less motor 12 to realize the quick stopping of the motor, and the typical braking time is smaller than 0.15s. This means that the coil of the brush-less motor 12 is utilized to generate the braking effect, and the braking effect can be achieved by only providing the electronic commutator 2 with a brake signal, while the cost and weight of the whole chainsaw will be lowered obviously. The control process of the present invention also comprises an alarm display process and a protection process. In the alarm display process, the whole brush-less chain's real-time working state can be displayed through the electronic commutator 2 and the alarm display device 19, for example, the real-time electric quantity, real-time working current, real-time saw temperature, real-time line-cutting speed, braking state prompt function, etc. In the protection process, the power supply 8 and the electronic commutator 2 of the entire system can identify communication, and the battery discharge is integrated in the brush-less control system; when the battery is over-charged or over-current, or over-hot, the system connection is cut off to protect the battery system. The power supply 8 and the electronic commutator 2 of the entire system can identify the communication, and the electronic commutator 2 can automatically control the adjustable output of the load and reduce the useless output of empty load to prolong the service life of the battery and fulfill the energy-saving purpose of the whole chainsaw. The brush-less chainsaw of the present invention has the beneficial effects of: utilizing the energy consumption mode of the motor coil to realize quick stopping of the motor, namely generating the braking effect to the motor coil simply by providing the control system with a brake signal, the cost and weight of the whole chainsaw will be lowered obviously; taking advantage of high efficiency (generally over 80%) and long service life of the brush-less motor and using the deceleration device to increase the output torque, small size, low cost, large torque and small braking current are achieved and the performance of the whole chainsaw is optimized.
