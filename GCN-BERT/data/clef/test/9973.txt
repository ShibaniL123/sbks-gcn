It is understandable that, to increase the binding force, the part of a ceramic projection that protrudes from the ceramic flat plate should contact the frame as much as possible. Preferably, the ceramic projection is partially embedded in the frame. Preferably, the porosity of the porous ceramic material is 20-60%, and a pore size is 1-1200 microns.

The ceramic flat plate is not limited in color, and may be white that is mainly aluminum oxide or zirconium oxide, or another color (such as black, blue, or multicolor) formed by adding substances such as impurities or colorants, or a color formed by sintering in a specific atmosphere. The first aspect of the embodiment of the present invention provides a ceramic casing structural part, which includes a ceramic casing and a frame. The frame can protect an edge of the ceramic casing from a direct collision with another object, thereby reducing a probability of breakage of the ceramic casing due to a collision with another hard object. A ceramic projection in the ceramic casing is of a porous ceramic material with a high porosity, and can increase a binding force between the ceramic casing and the frame, thereby improving an overall drop-resistant capability of the ceramic casing structural part in the present invention, and expanding an application scope of the ceramic casing structural part. According to the second aspect, an embodiment of the present invention provides a method for preparing a ceramic casing structural part, including the following steps: take ceramic powder, and perform ball-milling to prepare dense ceramic slurry; take more ceramic powder, add a pore-forming agent, and perform ball-milling to prepare porous ceramic slurry; separately dry and then grain the dense ceramic slurry and the porous ceramic slurry, and fill them respectively into a groove in a ceramic casing die corresponding to a ceramic flat plate and a groove in the ceramic casing die corresponding to a ceramic projection to mold them into a ceramic embryo; and then sinter the obtained ceramic embryo to prepare a ceramic casing, where the ceramic casing includes a ceramic flat plate of a dense ceramic material with a density higher than 90% and a ceramic projection of a porous ceramic material, where the ceramic projection is partially embedded in the ceramic flat plate; and take raw materials of a frame and the ceramic casing, and prepare the ceramic casing structural part by using an integrated molding method, where the frame abuts the ceramic flat plate along a thickness direction of the ceramic flat plate by using the ceramic projection, an upper surface and a lower surface of the frame are respectively level with an upper surface and a lower surface of the ceramic casing, and a material of the frame is an alloy, a metal-based composite material, or plastic. Preferably, the pore-forming agent is selected from one or more of the following: carbon dust, graphite, wood flour, coke, paraffin, and molding powder. Preferably, the pore-forming agent takes up 20-60% of a total volume of the porous ceramic slurry. Preferably, the ceramic projection is partially embedded in the frame. Components of the ceramic powder may be adjusted according to different requirements for product performance, and there is no specific limitation. A main component of the ceramic powder is not limited. Preferably, a main component of the ceramic powder is aluminum oxide or zirconium oxide, and a grain size is of a micron scale or a nanometer scale. The ceramic flat plate is used as an exterior part in this embodiment of the present invention; therefore, to obtain ceramic flat plates with different exterior colors, a dense ceramic material may be formed by mixing other oxides with the ceramic powder, and these other oxides may be selected from but is not limited to yttrium oxide and magnesium oxide; ceramic flat plates with different exterior colors may also be obtained by adding colorants or through sintering in a specific atmosphere, and the ceramic powder may include both aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide Preferably, polyvinyl alcohol or zirconium xerogel is added as a binder during a ball-milling process. Preferably, a mass of the added binder is 1-15% that of the ceramic powder. Preferably, distilled water or anhydrous alcohol may also be added as a medium during the ball-milling process, and oleic acid is added as a dispersant, and stearic acid is added as a grinding aid. Preferably, the graining is preparing particles that pass through a 20-80 mesh screen. A specific manner of embryo molding is not limited, and may be dry pressing molding, compression molding, isostatic pressing molding, hot die-casting molding, slip casting molding, extrusion molding, roll model molding, injection molding, or in-situ solidification molding, and is preferably dry pressing molding.

A specific manner of molding sintering is not limited, and may be pressureless sintering, hot pressing sintering, isostatic pressing sintering, reactive sintering, atmosphere sintering, electric spark sintering, or spark plasma sintering, and is preferably hot pressing sintering. Because a sintering-molded ceramic casing will be placed into a die and pressed in a subsequent operation, the ceramic casing will break if it is not flat. Therefore, flatness of the upper and lower surfaces of the prepared ceramic casing must be ensured during a sintering process. Generally, pressure sintering is used to ensure flatness. A specific condition of the sintering process is set according to components of the ceramic powder. When a main component of the ceramic powder is aluminum oxide, a sintering condition is preferably: at 150-450° Celsius (C), raising the temperature at a rate of 1 degree centigrade per minute; at 700-950° C., raising the temperature at a rate of 2° C. per minute; after the temperature rises to 1400-1600° C., maintaining it for 2-4 hours, and then obtaining a room temperature through natural cooling. When a main component of the ceramic powder is zirconium oxide, a sintering condition is preferably raising the temperature to 600-700° C. and maintaining it for two hours; then slowly raising the temperature to 1600° C. and maintaining it for two hours; and then obtaining a room temperature through natural cooling. The ceramic flat plate is not limited in shape or thickness, and may be prepared with various shapes according to actual demands for a product. Preferably, the ceramic flat plate is a rectangular flat plate. The upper and lower surfaces of the ceramic flat plate have proper flatness. A ceramic projection is not limited in shape or position, and may be partially embedded in a position such as a side face or the lower surface that are of the ceramic flat plate and can contact the frame, where the “can contact the frame” includes a part of the ceramic projection that protrudes from the ceramic flat plate may abut the frame or may be partially or entirely embedded in the frame, with a purpose to fill pores with the frame material by taking advantage of a high porosity of a porous ceramic material of the ceramic projection, thereby increasing a binding force between the ceramic flat plate and the frame. It is understandable that, to increase the binding force, the part of a ceramic projection that protrudes from the ceramic flat plate should contact the frame as much as possible. Preferably, the ceramic projection is partially embedded in the frame. The integrated molding method includes conventional methods of integrated manufacturing, such as injection molding, injection molding, casting molding, and die-casting molding, and the ceramic casing in the prepared ceramic casing structural part is closely embedded in the frame. A shape of the frame is not limited but depends on an actual demand, and usually includes a bend angle structure. The material of the frame may be an alloy, a metal-based composite material, or plastic. The alloy may be an aluminum alloy, a magnesium alloy, a zinc alloy, or the like, and is preferably an aluminum alloy. Preferably, when the material of the frame is an alloy, the integrated molding method is die-casting molding, and a specific operation is placing the ceramic casing into a die-casting die cavity for the ceramic casing structural part, and performing die-casting molding with a liquid or semi-solid alloy material to obtain the ceramic casing structural part. Because the ceramic casing is a compound formed by combining a porous ceramic material and a dense ceramic material to an embryo, and the ceramic projection is of a porous ceramic material. During a process of integrated molding, a liquid or molten alloy material permeates pores of the porous ceramic material, so that the frame is closely combined with the ceramic casing to finally form an integrated ceramic casing structural part.
