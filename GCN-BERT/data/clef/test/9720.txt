Undesirable growth of microbes often occurs on the surface of a plastic article. It is desirable to incorporate antimicrobial materials into the plastic so as to inhibit or prevent the growth of such microbes. U.S. Pat. No. 7,846,856 discloses polymer fibers that contain antimicrobial composition that comprises a metal complexed with a complexing polymer. The methods taught by U.S. Pat. No. 7,846,856 involve drying the antimicrobial composition and then directly adding the dried antimicrobial composition to a relatively large amount of plastic. It has been found that dried antimicrobial compositions like those taught by U.S. Pat. No. 7,846,856 have a tendency to discolor when heated, and they do not disperse well when added directly to plastics. It is desired to produce antimicrobial compositions having one or more of the following advantages: that have reduced tendency toward discoloration when heated; that disperse well when added directly to plastics. It is also desired to produce antimicrobial compositions that, when added to plastics, produce plastic articles that have antimicrobial activity on the surface of the article and that maintain that antimicrobial activity over time. The following is a statement of the invention. An aspect of the present invention is a silver-containing composition that comprises (a) silver ion, (b) a polymer that has pendant unsaturated or aromatic heterocycles, and (c) solid particles having median diameter of 2 mm or smaller, wherein some or all of said particles have a coating comprising said silver ion and said polymer (b). The following is a detailed description of the invention. As used herein, the following terms have the designated definitions, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. “Silver ion” has charge of +1. The term “microbicide”, “biocide”, “preservative” or “antimicrobial compound” refers to a compound capable of killing, inhibiting the growth of, or controlling the growth of microorganisms at a locus; microbicides include bactericides, fungicides and algaecides. The term “microorganism” includes, for example, fungi (such as yeast and mold), bacteria, and algae. The term “locus” refers to a system or product, or surface thereof, that is subject to contamination by microorganisms. Microorganisms that are affected by microbicide include, but are not limited to, Aureobasidium pullulans, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Chaetomium globosum, Enterobacter aerogines, Escherichia coli, Gliocladtum virens, Klebsiella Pheumoniae, Legionella pneumpophila, Listeria Monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Salmonella gallinarum, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Trycophyton malmsten, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Stachybotrys, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Penicillium funiculosum. Unless otherwise specified, temperatures discussed herein are in degrees centigrade (° C.), and references to percentages (%) and parts per million (ppm) are by weight. A “polymer,” as used herein and as defined by F W Billmeyer, JR. in Textbook of Polymer Science, second edition, 1971, is a relatively large molecule made up of the reaction products of smaller chemical repeat units. Polymers may have structures that are linear, branched, star shaped, looped, hyperbranched, crosslinked, or a combination thereof; polymers may have a single type of repeat unit (“homopolymers”) or they may have more than one type of repeat unit (“copolymers”). Copolymers may have the various types of repeat units arranged randomly, in sequence, in blocks, in other arrangements, or in any mixture or combination thereof. Polymer molecular weights can be measured by standard methods such as, for example, size exclusion chromatography (SEC, also called gel permeation chromatography or GPC). Polymers have number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 500 or more. Polymers may have extremely high Mn; some polymers have Mn above 1,000,000; typical polymers have Mn of 1,000,000 or less. Some polymers are crosslinked, and crosslinked polymers are considered to have infinite Mn. As used herein “weight of polymer” means the dry weight of polymer. Molecules that can react with each other to form the repeat units of a polymer are known herein as “monomers.” One example of a class of monomers that are useful in the present invention are, for example, ethylenically unsaturated monomers (i.e., monomers that have at least one carbon-carbon double bond). Among such monomers are, for example, vinyl monomers, which have the structure where each of R1, R2, R3, and R4 is, independently, a hydrogen, a halogen, an aliphatic group (such as, for example, an alkyl group), a substituted aliphatic group, an aryl group, a substituted aryl group, another substituted or unsubstituted organic group, or any combination thereof. Some suitable vinyl monomers include, for example, styrene, substituted styrenes, dienes, ethylene, ethylene derivatives, and mixtures thereof. Ethylene derivatives include, for example, unsubstituted or substituted versions of the following: ethenyl esters of substituted or unsubstituted alkanoic acids (including, for example, vinyl acetate and vinyl neodecanoate), acrylonitrile, (meth)acrylic acids, (meth)acrylates, (meth)acrylamides, vinyl chloride, halogenated alkenes, and mixtures thereof. As used herein, “(meth)acrylic” means acrylic or methacrylic; “(meth)acrylate” means acrylate or methacrylate; and “(meth)acrylamide” means acrylamide or methacrylamide. “Substituted” means having at least one attached chemical group such as, for example, alkyl group, alkenyl group, vinyl group, hydroxyl group, carboxylic acid group, other functional groups, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, substituted monomers include, for example, monomers with more than one carbon-carbon double bond, monomers with hydroxyl groups, monomers with other functional groups, and monomers with combinations of functional groups. A polymer that is made by polymerizing a certain monomer, either alone or with other monomers, is said herein to include that monomer as a polymerized unit. A chemical group that is part of a polymer is said herein to be “pendant” if it is covalently attached to the polymer but is not part of the backbone of the polymer chain. As used herein, a “solvent” is a material that is liquid at 25° C.; that has boiling point, at 1 atmosphere pressure, of greater than 25° C.; and that is capable of dissolving a polymer (b) of the present invention. A polymer is herein considered dissolved in a solvent if individual polymer chains are in intimate contact with the solvent. Individual dissolved polymer chains may be linear or branched. In typical solutions, each polymer chain is in a random coil configuration or a close approximation thereof. A polymer solution will not settle or form a separate phase upon standing for at least 5 days at 23° C. Some polymer solutions are clear to the naked eye, and some polymer solutions appear hazy. A solvent may be a pure substance or it may contain plural substances dissolved in each other. For example, a solvent may contain two or more miscible liquids. Material that is solid at 25° C. is not considered to be part of the solvent, whether or not it is dissolved in liquid. As used herein, a solvent is “aqueous” if the solvent contains 50% or more water by weight based on the weight of the solvent. All other solvents are considered herein to be non-aqueous. As used herein, when a ratio is said to be “X:1 or higher (or lower)” it is meant that the ratio has value of Y:1, where Y is equal to X or is higher (or lower). For example, if a certain ratio is said herein to be “3:1 or higher,” that ratio may be, for example, 3:1 or 4:1 or 100:1, but that ratio may not be, for example, 2:1 or 1:1. For another example, if a certain ratio is said herein to be “8:1 or lower”, that ratio may be, for example, 8:1 or 7:1 or 0.5:1, but that ratio may not be, for example, 9:1 or 10:1. As used herein, a heterocycle is a cyclic organic radical in which at least one member of the ring is a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom, or a sulfur atom. A heterocycle is considered herein to be “unsaturated or aromatic” if there is at least one pair of members of the ring in which the two members of that pair are connected to each other by a double bond. A heterocycle is not considered herein to be “unsaturated or aromatic” if all of the members of the ring are connected to each other by single bonds, even if one or more member of the ring is connected by a double bond to an atom that is not a member of the ring. A collection of particles may be characterized by the median diameter. Half of the mass of the collection is made up of particles that have diameter smaller than the median diameter. Particles may have any shape. Particles may be spheres, rods, disks, irregular shapes, other shapes, or any combination or mixture thereof. If a particle is not spherical, its diameter herein is taken to be the length of the longest chord for that particle; a chord is a straight line segment that passes through the center of mass of the particle and that has each of its end points located on the surface of the particle. As used herein, a material is “solid” if it is solid at 25° C. As used herein, the term “isolate” refers to a process in which a solid material begins in an initial mixture with a liquid material and in which the solid material is then separated from the liquid material. The initial mixture of solid and liquid may be a solution, a dispersion, a slurry, or some other form of mixture, or a combination thereof. The “solids content” of a composition is determined as follows. The composition is heated to a temperature that is 100° C. or higher and that is below the decomposition temperature of the composition. The composition is heated under conditions in which volatile materials can escape (such as, for example, convection or vacuum) until the weight of the sample no longer changes appreciably. The solids content is the ratio of the final weight of the composition after heating to the initial weight of the composition prior to heating, expressed as a percentage. The silver-containing composition of the present invention contains one or more polymer, herein called “polymer (b),” that has pendant unsaturated or aromatic heterocycle. Preferably, polymer (b) is a vinyl polymer. As used herein, a vinyl polymer is a polymer formed from vinyl monomers by polymerization reaction among carbon-carbon double bonds to form the polymer backbone. Preferably, vinyl polymers are made by free-radical polymerization. Certain types of monomers are useful as polymerized units of polymer (b). These types of monomers are known herein as first monomer, second monomer, third monomer, fourth monomer and fifth monomer, as defined below. As used herein, these types do not overlap. For example, a monomer that meets the definition of first monomer does not meet the definition of second, third, fourth, or fifth monomer, etc. Polymer (b) has polymerized units of one or more first monomer. A first monomer is monomer with one or more pendant unsaturated or aromatic heterocycle. As used herein, a heterocycle is pendant on a monomer when it is covalently attached to the monomer in such a way that the heterocycle will not participate in the polymerization reaction. That is, the heterocycle will be pendant on the polymer chain after the monomer participates in a polymerization reaction.

Independently, preferred heterocycles are those with 9 or fewer members of the heterocycle ring; more preferably 7 or fewer members.

Preferred among such heterocycles are those in which the heteroatom or combination of heteroatoms are chosen from among the following combinations: one sulfur atom; or one nitrogen atom and one oxygen atom; or one nitrogen atom; or two nitrogen atoms; or three nitrogen atoms; or 4 nitrogen atoms.

Preparation of Polymer Solution PS1 Using the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,846,856, polymer solution PS1 was made. The solvent was, by weight based on the weight of the solvent, 70% ethanol and 30% water. The polymer composition was, by weight based on the weight of polymer solids, 45% vinyl imidazole, 40% n-butyl acrylate, and 15% acrylic acid. The polymer solids were 22.5% by weight based on the weight of the solution. The amount of silver ion was 2.9% by weight based on the weight of the solution. The solution also contained ammonium, nitrate, and hydroxide ions. The solution had a light yellow color. Preparation of Concentrates. 72 g of either PEP1 or SGP1 were gradually added into 100 g PS1 under 1000 rpm stirring (IKA stirrer) at RT. After mixing for 30 min, the resulting yellow viscous fluid was taken out and dried at 100° C. in a vacuum oven (DZF-6030A, Shanghai Yihen) for 72 hour. The dried mixtures were then ground to micropowders with a mortar/pestle. The dried mixture made with PEP1 is herein called Conc-PEP1, and the dried mixture made with SGP1 is herein called Conc-SGP1. For comparative purposes, ultraconcentrates were also prepared. These were solid materials having silver ion concentration of approximately 10% by weight; these materials do not contain solid particles coated with polymer and silver ion. These ultra-concentrates are comparative examples. Ultraconcentrate UC1 was prepared by evaporating PS1 to dryness. Ultraconcentrate UC2 was prepared by adding nitric acid to PS1 to bring the pH to 6.91 and then evaporating to dryness. Discoloration of concentrates was studied as follows. For each sample that was tested, two 20-ml flasks were prepared, and 100 mg of sample was placed in each. Both flasks were heated in an oil bath; one was jacketed with nitrogen and the other was exposed to air. Discoloration was monitored during the heating from RT up to approximately 250° C. Samples tested in this way were UC1, UC2, Conc-PEP1, and Conc-SBP1. Similar experiments were conducted for a certain amount of three comparative inorganic commercial antibacterial powders (Comp1, Comp2, and Comp3) under air with the same dosage of silver ion as in Conc-PEP1 and Conc-SGP1. Compounding with matrix plastic was performed as follows. The compounding was done in a HAAKE PolyLab™ Mixer (Thermo). 49.5 g LDPE pellets were first melted for 5 min under 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) and then continuously compounded for another 5 min after adding concentrate or ultraconcentrate or comparative commercial antibacterial powder. The theoretical silver ion content in the compounded sample was 50 ppm by weight based on the weight of the compounded sample. The compounding temperature was 120° C. The compounded samples were then compression molded in a hot press at the same temperatures for 3 minutes to obtain the final sheets with a thickness of 3 mm Compounding three comparative samples (Comp1, Comp2, and Comp3) and AgNO3 with LDPE was also carried out at 120° C. for total of 10 min. Aging Test Plastic samples were cut into rectangular pieces of 40×40 mm, and then placed in an aging oven (GDW series, Wuxi Suwei) at 60° C. for 8 weeks. At a given time, the samples were taken out and cooled to RT. The overall color change was scanned by an Epson scanner. The a*, b* and L* values were measured by a colorimeter (HunterLab ColorQuest™ XE colorimeter) with data averaged from at least 3 points of each piece. The calculated yellow index was used to evaluate the anti-aging abilities of the samples. As a comparison, the benchmark samples were also measured by the same method. Antimicrobial Test Plastic samples before and after aging were then tested on the antimicrobial performance using the ATCC 6538P method. Briefly, plastic sheets were cut into square pieces of 40×40 mm, and then inoculums (S. Aureus) were added on a 30×30 mm square. Colony-forming units (cfu) of the cultured pieces were tested after 24 hours. Blank plastic pieces without silver were also tested. Antimicrobial efficacy (log Kill) was then defined as log10 (cfu on blank test piece after 24 hours divided by cfu on treated test piece after 24 hours). All data were averaged from 2 parallel specimens. The benchmark samples were also tested as a comparison. In some experiments, specimens were wiped, then aged, and then given the antimicrobial test. The wiping procedure was as follows: samples were placed successively in ethanol and water under ultrasonication for 1.5 h and 30 min, respectively. After that, the samples were taken out, and the surfaces were wiped by hand for another 15 min Finally, they were rinsed with water followed by drying. EXAMPLE 1 Results of the Discoloration Test Comp1, Comp2, and Comp3 remained white throughout the test. The other samples showed color, in order of discoloration, as follows: LY (light yellow, least discolored); Y (yellow); Br (Brown); dBr (dark brown); vdBr (very dark brown); Blk (black).

EXAMPLE 2 Results of the Test for Antimicrobial Activity on the Surface of Plastic Sheets Versus Time The matrix plastic was LDPE; the amount of silver compound was chosen to give a theoretical concentration of silver ion in each sample was 50 ppm by weight based on the weight of the sample. Storage temperature was 60° C. Log Kill values of 3 or higher indicate effectively complete killing of microbes.

EXAMPLE 3 Results of the Test for Antimicrobial Activity on the Surface of Plastic Sheets after Wiping The matrix plastic was LDPE; the amount of silver compound was chosen to give a theoretical concentration of silver ion in each sample was 50 ppm by weight based on the weight of the sample. Log Kill values of 3 or higher indicate effectively complete killing of microbes. Storage temperature was 60° C.

EXAMPLE 4 Distribution of Antimicrobial Compound in the Matrix Plastic The distribution of Conc-PEP1 and Conc-SGP1 in matrix plastic were compared to the distribution of antimicrobial compound in the samples that were prepared and reported in U.S. Pat. No. 7,846,856. When Conc-PEP1 and Conc-SGP1 were compounded into LDPE as described above, using compounding temperature of 120° C., the samples were white and translucent, similar in appearance to similarly compounded sheets of LDPE alone, which shows that the silver concentrate was distributed evenly throughout the sample. The samples reported in U.S. Pat. No. 7,846,856 were made by drying a silver/polymer complex to make an ultraconcentrate outside of the definition of the present invention. That ultraconcentrate was then mixed with powdered polypropylene resin and then extruded, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,846,856. The resulting plastic articles were cloudy, showing that the antimicrobial compound did not distribute evenly. EXAMPLE 5 Observation of Conc-PEP1 and Conc-SGP1 Samples of Conc-PEP1 and Conc-SGP1 were coated with a thin carbon layer and observed using a Scanning Electron Microscope (Brucker Company). The Conc-PEP1 particles appeared to have median diameter of approximately 500 micrometer. The coating on the Conc-PEP1 appeared as discrete particles on the surface of the solid LDPE particles. The coating particles appeared to have median diameter of less than one micrometer. A representative coating particle was analyzed by X-ray spectroscopy, which verified the presence of silver in the coating particle. The Conc-SG1 particles appeared to have median diameter of approximately 40 micrometer. The coating on the Conc-SGP1 appeared as discrete particles on the surface of the solid silica gel particles. The coating particles appeared to have median diameter of less than one micrometer. A representative coating particle was analyzed by X-ray spectroscopy, which verified the presence of silver in the coating particle. 1.
