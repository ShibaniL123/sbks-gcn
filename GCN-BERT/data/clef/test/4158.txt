REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present invention claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application 61/506,732, entitled “COMPOSITION, AND METHOD OF USING THE COMPOSITION, EFFECTIVE FOR MINIMIZING THE HARMFUL EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM ALCOHOL INTOXICATION” filed on Jul. 12, 2011, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a composition which reduces the levels of alcohol in an individual's system; and more particularly to a composition specifically formulated to increase one or more metabolic pathways resulting in the breakdown of alcohols to sugars in the body, thereby clearing the alcohol from the body at a rate that is faster than normal physiological time periods. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Metabolism is a vital aspect of all living organisms. It is the set of chemical reactions which occur within all living organisms in order to maintain life. In humans, metabolism involves complex networks of hormones and enzymes which convert foods into fuel. In general, humans receive the energy needed for daily functioning and driving of cellular mechanisms from food sources through metabolism. Specific proteins in the body control the chemical reactions of metabolism, and each chemical reaction is coordinated with other body functions. The process of metabolism involves a continuous balancing of catabolism, the set of processes that break down molecules into smaller units and release energy, and anabolism, the set of processes which build molecules from smaller units. Alcohol, while prohibited by certain users such as individuals under the age of 21, is commonly used within a variety of beverage types. As a result of its status and ease of manufacture, it is one of the most widely used drugs in the world, acting as a central nervous system depressant. The central nervous system, therefore, is the body system that is most severely affected by alcohol. The drug quickly enters the bloodstream where, depending on the user, it can have numerous effects. Blood alcohol levels are used to legally define if an individual suffers from alcohol intoxication, or is considered “drunk.” In most states, the blood alcohol legal limit usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10. The degree to which the central nervous system function is impaired is directly proportional to the concentration of alcohol in the blood. When ingested, alcohol passes from the stomach into the small intestine, where it is rapidly absorbed into the blood and distributed throughout the body. Because it is distributed so quickly and thoroughly, alcohol can affect the central nervous system even in small concentrations. The American Medical Association has defined the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level of impairment for all people to be 0.04 grams/100 milliliters of blood (equivalent to 0.04 grams/210 liters of breath). Numerous studies have been undertaken in order to better understand the affects alcohol has on individuals, and how they are commonly expressed. For example, at BAC levels of 0.03 to 0.12, it is not uncommon for individuals to feel euphoria and have one or more symptoms: mild euphoria, become more social and talkative, increased self-confidence, decreased inhibitions, diminution of attention, judgment and control, sensory-motor impairment, and loss of efficiency in finer performance tests. At levels of 0.09-0.25. individuals begin to suffer from emotional instability, loss of critical judgments, impairment of perception, memory and comprehension, deceased sensatory response, increased reaction times, reduced visual acuity, impaired balance, lack of sensory-motor coordination, and drowsiness. At BAC of 0.18-0.3, individuals often become confused, disorientated, have mental confusion, dizziness and exaggerated emotional states, suffer from disturbances in vision and perception, have increased pain thresholds, suffer from apathy, and have slurred speech. At levels of 0.25-0.4, individuals may suffer from near complete loss of motor functions, decreased responses to stimuli, lack of muscular coordination, and impaired consciousness. At levels greater than 0.45, complete unconsciousness and death from respiratory arrest could result. Once alcohol is consumed, the body handles the drug through the processes of absorption, distribution, and elimination. All three processes generally occur simultaneously. Alcohol is absorbed from the stomach and small intestine by diffusion. Most absorption occurs from the small intestine due to its large surface area and rich blood supply. The rate of absorption varies with the emptying time of the stomach. Generally, the higher the alcohol concentration of the beverage, the faster the rate of absorption. However, above a certain concentration, the rate of absorption may decrease due to the delayed passage of alcohol from the stomach into the small intestine. The maximum absorption rate is obtained with the consumption of an alcoholic beverage containing approximately 20-25% (by volume or v/v) alcohol solution on an empty stomach. The absorption rate may be less when alcohol is consumed with food or when a 40% (v/v) alcohol solution is consumed on an empty stomach. The rate may also slow down when high fluid volume/low alcohol content beverages, such as beer, are consumed. For normal social-type drinking, the highest BAC is usually achieved within 30 minutes after completion of consumption, though it could take as long as 60 minutes. When large amounts of alcohol are consumed over a short time interval, or when a large quantity of food is eaten with the alcohol, the absorption phase may not be complete for up to two (2) hours after last consumption. In other situations, a subject may develop a plateau, where the blood alcohol level does not change for up to two hours. When this occurs, the rate of absorption is equal to the rate of elimination and hence the blood alcohol concentration does not change. After two hours, the rate of elimination will exceed the rate of absorption and the blood alcohol level will begin to decrease. Once in the blood, alcohol is carried throughout the body. The alcohol diffuses into tissues and fluids according to their water content. During the absorption phase, the BAC of arterial blood is greater than the BAC of venous blood. Arteries carry blood to a tissue, and veins remove blood from the tissue. At equilibrium, where the tissue has absorbed a proportionate quantity of alcohol, the BAC of arterial blood is equal to the BAC of venous blood. Alcohol is eliminated from the body by excretion and metabolism, typically through elimination by the kidney (urine), lung (exhale), or liver where it is chemically broken down to acetic acid. An average person can eliminate 0.5 oz (15 ml) of alcohol per hour. So, it would take approximately one hour to eliminate the alcohol from a 12 oz (355 ml) can of beer. Most alcohol is metabolized, or burned, in a manner similar to food, yielding carbon dioxide and water. A small portion of alcohol is excreted, such as through the breath, leaving the body as alcohol, unchanged. Elimination occurs at a constant rate for a given individual. The median rate of decrease in BAC is considered to be 15 milligrams percent (mg %) per hour. The range of decrease in BAC is 10-20 mg % per hour. This range represents the extreme ends of the rate encountered in a normal population. Most people eliminate at a rate of between 13 and 18 mg % per hour. Given its effects on individuals, alcohol consumption is commonly undertaken in social situations. Drank responsibly, the body can process the drug accordingly. For the average individual, it is estimated that it takes approximately 4 hours for the body to process and filter 4 ounces of alcohol. The problem associated with alcohol consumption rests in the fact that too much too fast prevents proper possessing and failure to eliminate quickly enough. As increasing levels of alcohol are placed in the body, at some point the body cannot process it fast enough, and high levels circulate within the blood. These high levels affect the brain, resulting in people becoming “drunk.” Under the right circumstances, being drunk may not be a problem. However, many individuals who are drunk engage in behavior that often results in unintended consequences. For example, drunken individuals sometimes become very aggressive. This behavior can result in the individual engaging in fights with others, which if sober, would not typically occur. These fights sometimes result in broken bones or bloody lips. However, such actions can result in individuals suffering more severe injuries, such as blunt traumas to the head and/or face, lacerations, or gun shot wounds which may be fatal. Intoxicated individuals may engage in other risky behaviors, such as driving while intoxicated. As described earlier, drunk individuals often suffer from confusion, decreased motor skills, and inability to properly operate vehicles, resulting in death or serious drunk-driving related injuries. For those individuals who continue to drink extremely large amounts or play various known drinking games which have the affect of consuming large amounts of alcohol in short times, alcohol poisoning may result. If individuals are not treated properly and/or immediately, death may result. While there are many home remedies for becoming sober, the most reliable method of reducing inebriation is the passage of time. This allows the body the time to process and clear any alcohol in the individual's system. One of the most difficult parts of treating a person suffering from alcohol poisoning is making the decision to seek medical help. Typically, treatment includes letting the individuals sleep it off. This provides passage of time in order to allow the body to clear the drug from its system. However, in the case where someone is suffering from alcohol poisoning, delay in treatment can be fatal. Treatment for alcohol poisoning typically requires gastric lavage, or stomach pumping, as well as careful monitoring of the individual's respiratory system. Drawbacks to this treatment include the need to get the person to the hospital, the need for invasive medical procedures, and time to allow such actions to counteract the effects of the alcohol. What is needed in the art, therefore, is a composition, which when taken by individuals suffering from alcohol intoxication, results in the clearance of alcohol from the body at a faster rate than clearance associated under normal physiology. Such a composition, therefore, would have the advantage of reducing negative consequences of intoxicated individuals, such as drunk driving or aggressive behavior, and offer quick relief for those who suffer from the often fatal alcohol poisoning. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART The instant invention is a unique composition comprising a plurality of ingredients, which have been found to provide unexpected results of reducing the time it takes for an individual suffering from alcohol intoxication to return to a normal, non-inebriated state. The composition includes individually known substances used for other purposes. However, none of the cited references describe a single composition including all of the ingredients for the intended purposes. U.S. Pat.

U.S. Publication No. 2011/0059882 describes a method for cleaning dentures by contacting the dentures with a solid, multi-layered composition having at least two parts in water. The first part of the composition comprises calcium hypochlorite, magnesium hypochlorite and mixtures thereof, a builder, a water-soluble polymer, and an acid. The first part does not contain sodium hypochlorite, lithium hypochlorite, potassium hypochlorite and mixtures thereof. The second part comprises a functional ingredient and a builder or filler. The second part does not contain any oxidants. International Publication No. WO2008/070368 describes compositions and methods for diminishing signs of photodamage and/or aging. Certain of the methods are described as comprising contacting skin with an effective amount of one or more elastase enzymes. Certain of the compositions reduce the evidence of elastic material when contacted with skin. The compositions and methods provide for topical application as well as administration by injection. U.S. Publication No. 2009/0068255 discloses a system for treating or caring for skin using matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors. The system is described as including the use of cosmetic pharmaceuticals which are capable of inhibiting the degradation of proteins found in the skin including collagen, elastin, and other basement membrane and extracellular matrix protein. The MMP inhibitors may be used in both cosmetic compositions and pharmaceutical compositions for application to skin. MMP inhibitors are further described as being formulated with a cosmetically suitable vehicle or pharmaceutically acceptable excipient for application to the skin as creams, lotions, ointments, solutions, or face masks. As for cosmetics, the MMP inhibitor compositions are also described as being capable of preventing or reducing the appearance of wrinkles, pigmentation changes, loss of elasticity, or other effects associated with aging or sun damage. With respect to pharmaceuticals, the MMP inhibitor compositions were also described as applicable to the skin to treat or prevent a skin disease (e.g., proliferative disease, inflammatory disease). U.S. Publication No. 2009/0214628 discloses compositions and their use for the treatment of human skin, particularly facial skin, to alleviate the symptoms of cosmetic or determatologic skin conditions. The invention describes a composition comprising: one or more metasilicate, one or more carbonate, one or more glyconate, and one or more sulfate. The composition may also contain salts, such as sea slats and other additives or active agents. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a composition, and methods of using the composition, for minimizing the harmful effects associated with alcohol consumption. The composition includes a plurality of components, including cognitive enhancers, neurostimulants, metabolic stimulants, mental clarifiers, or mental focusing agents, amino acids, vitamins, electrolytes, minerals, stabilizers, detoxifying agents, metal, toxin, fat absorbing agents, fibers, including dietary fibers, anti-oxidants, and other agents, which when combined, have the unexpected effect of increasing one or more metabolic pathways in the individual. As the metabolic rate is increased, alcohol is burned off, or utilized as an energy source, at a considerably much faster rate than under normal physiological means. It is believed that the composition may have an effect on the brain, causing it to increase metabolic rates. As the brain undergoes such a super-fast metabolic process or directs other metabolic processes to rapidly increase, it utilizes alcohol, which in an inebriated person is plentiful. The alcohol is converted to sugar in order to provide an energy source for the increased metabolism. As a result, alcohol levels in the individual are burned off and removed at a much faster rate than under normal physiological time frames. As the alcohol is burned off, the individual returns to a pre-inebriated state and can function as a normal “non-drunk” individual. The present invention includes a plurality of components in an effective amount to provide an alcohol based treatment. As used herein, the term “effective amount” generally refers to the amount of a compound that is sufficient to effect treatment as defined herein when administered to an individual, such as a mammal, preferably a human, in need of such treatment. As used herein, the term “treat”, “treating” or “treatment” refers to the administration of therapy to a subject, particularly a mammal, more particularly a human, who already manifests or is suspected of manifesting at least one symptom of alcohol inebriation, impairment or poisoning to obtain a desired pharmacological and physiological effect. The term may also include 1) preventing the alcohol intoxication, inebriation, impairment or poisoning, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms and/or characteristics not to develop in a human that may be exposed to or predisposed to the effects of alcohol but does not yet experience or display symptoms of alcohol inebriation, severe or moderate impairment, or poisoning, 2) inhibiting the alcohol intoxication, inebriation, severe or moderate impairment, or poisoning, i.e. arresting or reducing the development of its characteristics or symptoms, including but not limited to sobering up, reducing blood alcohol concentrations, improving cognitive behavior to a level which corresponds to the same level of the individual when not suffering alcohol intoxication, inebriation, severe or moderate impairment, or poisoning, burning off and removing alcohol levels in the blood at a much faster rate than under normal physiological time frames, thus returning the individual to a pre-inebriated state, allowing that individual to function as a normal “non-drunk,” or providing for the brain to undergo increased metabolic processes or directing other metabolic processes to rapidly increase and it utilize alcohol in the individual's system as an energy source, or 3) relieving the alcohol intoxication, inebriation, severe or moderate impairment, or poisoning i.e., sobering up, causing regression of characteristics or symptoms including but not limited to reducing blood alcohol concentrations, improving cognitive behavior to a level which corresponds to the same level of the individual when not suffering alcohol intoxication, inebriation, severe or moderate impairment, or poisoning, burning off and removing alcohol levels at a much faster rate than under normal physiological time frames, thus returning the individual to a pre-intoxication or inebriated state, allowing the individual to function as a normal “non-drunk”, or providing for the brain to undergo increased metabolic processes or directing other metabolic processes to rapidly increase and it utilize alcohol in the individual's system as an energy source. Accordingly, it is an objective of the instant invention to provide a composition which, when administered to an individual suffering from alcohol intoxication or alcohol poisoning, results in clearance of any alcohol within the body at a much faster rate than under normal physiological time frames. It is also an objective of the instant invention to provide a composition which, when administered to an individual suffering from alcohol intoxication or alcohol poisoning, results in increasing one or more metabolic pathways that converts the alcohol to sugars as a source of energy. It is a further objective of the instant invention to provide a composition which acts as a neurostimulant acting on the brain to increase metabolic pathways, converting alcohol to sugar. It is a further objective of the instant invention to provide a composition which reduces the time it takes for an alcohol intoxicated individual to become sober. It is yet another objective of the instant invention to provide a composition which reduces the time it takes to remove alcohol from an individual who suffers from alcohol poisoning. It is a still further objective of the invention to provide a composition which reduces the time it takes the body of an individual who suffers from alcohol intoxication to remove the alcohol from a period measured in hours to a period measured in minutes. It is a further objective of the instant invention to provide a composition which reduces the time it takes the body of an individual person who suffers from alcohol intoxication to reduce levels alcohol to less than the legal limit within less than 30 minutes. It is a further objective of the instant invention to provide a composition which reduces the time it takes the body of an individual person who suffers from alcohol intoxication to reduce the amount of alcohol levels in a time period of around 15 minutes. Other objectives and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In certain embodiments of the present invention, a plurality of ingredients is combined to form a unique composition. Administering the composition to an individual who is intoxicated or otherwise contains high levels of alcohol in their blood results in increasing the rate of one or more metabolic pathways, thereby decreasing the amount of alcohol in the blood as the metabolic processes use the alcohol as a source of energy. Administration of the composition, therefore, results in breakdown of the alcohol, as well as a removal or reduction of the feeling of inebriation, at a much faster rate than accomplished under normal physiological time frames. In certain embodiments, the composition comprises bitter orange. Bitter orange refers to a citrus tree, Citrus aurantium, and its fruit. Although native to east Africa and tropical parts of Asia, Citrus aurantium is now grown in the Mediterranean regions and parts of the United States. It is also known as Seville orange, sour orange, Zhi shi, and marmalade orange. Bitter orange is used in a variety of applications including foods, cosmetics, essential oils for perfumes, and aromatherapy products. Bitter orange has been used in traditional Chinese medicine and by indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest for nausea, indigestion, and constipation. The extract of bitter orange peel has been used in dietary supplements as an aid to fat loss and as an appetite suppressant. Bitter orange contains the tyramine metabolites N-methyltyramine, octopamine and synephrine, substances similar to epinephrine, which acts on the α1-adrenergic receptor to constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure and heart rate. Other uses include as a remedy to treat heart burn, nasal congestion, treat fungal infections, as a fat burner, and for increasing mental focus and providing energy. The bitter orange peel is used as an appetite stimulant and for dyspepsia. Bitter orange fruit and peel are also used orally for weight loss, increasing lean body mass, body building, improving athletic performance, nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The bitter orange flower and its oil are used orally for gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, duodenal ulcers, constipation, regulating blood lipid levels, lowering blood sugar in diabetes, hyperlipidemia, blood purification, functional disorders of liver and gallbladder, stimulation of the heart and circulation, frostbite, as a sedative for sleep disorders, for kidney and bladder diseases, general feebleness, anemia, imbalances of mineral metabolism, impurities of the skin, hair loss, as a tonic, anti-flatulent, and for cancer. Other uses include administration to relieve prolapsed uterus, prolapsed anus or rectum, diarrhea, and blood in the stools. Topically, bitter orange peel is used for inflammation of the eyelid, conjunctiva, and retina. It is also used for retinal hemorrhage and to relieve exhaustion accompanying colds. In certain embodiments, the composition comprises 1,3 dimethylethylalanine. Alanine is an alpha-amino acid having a chemical formula of CH3Ch(NH)2COOH. It is a nonessential amino acid found in foods, and acts as one of the building blocks for proteins. In certain embodiments, the composition comprises Hordenine. Hordenine is an ingredient of some plants which are used as feed for animals, i.e. in sprouting barley. Hordenine (N,N-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenylethylamine) is a phenethylamine alkaloid with antibacterial and antibiotic properties. It stimulates the release of norepinephrine in mammals, working as a stimulant. It is produced in nature by several varieties of plants in the family Cactaceae and by some in Acacia. Hordenine has been promoted as a weight loss agent with the claim that it stimulates the central nervous system. It has also been used as a beta agonist and as a metabolic stimulant. Although little research has been done on hordenine, results of some experiments in pharmacological models show that hordenine is an indirectly acting adrenergic drug. In isolated organs and those structures with reduced epinephrine contents, the hordenine—has been shown to have minimal effect. Experiments in intact animals (rats, dogs) show that hordenine has a positive inotropic effect upon the heart, increases systolic and diastolic blood pressure, peripheral blood flow volume, and inhibits gut movements. In some embodiments, the composition comprises green apple pectin, or fibersol, or other fiber source. Pectin in the plant starting material is part of a very complex structure, which gives shape to the soft non-woody parts of the plant. It is a structural heteropolysaccharide contained in the primary cell walls of terrestrial plants. Pectin is a natural part of human diet, but does not contribute significantly to nutrition as it is a soluble dietary fiber. Green apple pectin has been used to absorb metals, toxins, fats, and to reduce heaviness in the blood. Fibersol is a resistant maltodextrin, or alternatively, a digestion resistant maltodextrin. It is 90% resistant to digestion by the human digestive system. Fibersol is sold as digestion resistant maltodextrin to clearly define that is it resistant to digestion and that it is not a digestible carbohydrate. It is typically supplied in capsules containing natural, bulk producing, soluble dietary fiber derived from fruit and plants. Each capsule provides the benefits of hemicelluloses (gum and pectin) and polysaccharides which are important for maintaining the proper pace and bulk required for healthy digestive function. In some embodiments, the composition comprises N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC). It is a pharmaceutical drug and nutritional supplement which has been used primarily as a mucolytic agent (expectorant), and in the management of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. Other uses include sulfate repletion in conditions, such as autism, where cysteine and related sulfur amino acids may be depleted. NAC is a derivative of cysteine in which an acetyl group is attached to the nitrogen atom. It is sold as a dietary supplement commonly claiming antioxidant and liver protecting effects (detoxifying). It is used as a cough medicine because it breaks disulfide bonds in mucus and liquefies it, making it easier to cough up. It is also this action of breaking disulfide bonds that makes it useful in thinning the abnormally thick mucus in Cystic Fibrosis patients. In some embodiments, the composition comprises vinpocetine. Vinpocetine is a semi-synthetic derivative alkaloid of vincamine, an extract from the periwinkle plant. Vinpocetine has been shown to be a cerebral metabolic enhancer and a selective cerebral vasodilator. Vinpocetine is reported to have cerebral blood flow enhancing and neuroprotective effects, and has been used for the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders and age-related memory impairment. Vinpocetine is marketed as a supplement for vasodilation and as a nootropic for the improvement of memory. Vinpocetine may help support brain functions such as concentration and memory by activating cerebral metabolism. Vinpocetine has also been identified as a potent anti-inflammatory agent that might have a potential role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In some embodiments, the composition comprises tyrosine. Tyrosine (4-hydroxyphenylalanine) is a nonessential amino acid the body makes from another amino acid called phenylalanine. Tyrosine is found in soy products, chicken, turkey, fish, peanuts, almonds, avocados, bananas, milk, cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese, lima beans, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds. It is a building block for several important neurotransmitters, including epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Tyrosine also helps produce melanin (the pigment responsible for hair and skin color) and helps in the function of organs responsible for making and regulating hormones, including the adrenal, thyroid, and pituitary glands. It is involved in the structure of almost every protein in the body and in the production of the stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. A number of studies have found tyrosine to be useful during conditions of stress, cold, fatigue, loss of a loved one such as in death or divorce, prolonged work and sleep deprivation, with reductions in stress hormone levels, reductions in stress-induced weight loss seen in animal trials, and improvements in cognitive and physical performance seen in human trials. In some embodiments, the composition comprises quercetin. Quercetin is a type of plant-based chemical, or phytochemical, known as a flavonoid found in apples, onions, teas, red wines, and many other foods. Flavonoids such as quercetin are antioxidants which scavenge free radicals, the substances which damage cell membranes, tamper with DNA, and even cause cell death. Antioxidants can neutralize free radicals and may reduce or even help prevent some of the damage they cause. They also help keep LDL cholesterol from being damaged. Quercetin may have anti-inflammatory properties. It has been promoted as being effective against a wide variety of diseases, including cancer. In some embodiments, the composition comprises piracetam. Piracetam chemical name 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide, is a nootropic drug. Nootropics are known commonly as cognitive enhancers, improving cognitive functions of the brain such as memory, attention and intelligence. Piracetam improves brain function and stimulates the central nervous system without any toxicity or addictive properties. In some embodiments, the composition comprises B-vitamin mix. B-vitamins are a group of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism. While originally thought to be a single vitamin, referred to as vitamin B, there exists eight chemically distinct B vitamins, including Vitamin B1 (thiamine), Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), Vitamin B3 (niacin or niacinamide), Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, or pyridoxine hydrochloride), Vitamin B7 (biotin), Vitamin B9 (folic acid), Vitamin B12 (various cobalamins, commonly cyanocobalamin in vitamin supplements). B vitamins are essential for growth, development, and a variety of other bodily functions. They play a major role in the activities of enzymes, proteins that regulate chemical reactions in the body, which are important in turning food into energy and other needed substances. The B vitamins are thought to be necessary to support and increase the rate of metabolism, maintain healthy skin and muscle tone, enhance immune and nervous system function, promote cell growth and division, including that of the red blood cells that help prevent anemia, and reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer when consumed in food, but not when ingested in vitamin tablet form. In some embodiments, the composition comprises an electrolyte mix. Electrolyte refers to salts, specifically ions, which are used by the body's cells (especially nerve, heart, muscle) to maintain voltages across their cell membranes and to carry electrical impulses (nerve impulses, muscle contractions) across themselves and to other cells. One or more of the major electrolytes found in the body may be included in the mix, such as: sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl−), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), bicarbonate (HCO3−), phosphate (PO42−), and sulfate (SO42−). The electrolyte mix may include, for example, calcium glycerol phosphate, magnesium glycerol phosphate, potassium glycerol phosphate, or combinations thereof. Other electrolytes known to one of skill in the art may be used as well. In some embodiments, the composition comprises dimethylethanolamine (DMAE). DMAE, also known as N,N-dimethyl-2-aminoethanol, beta-dimethylaminoethyl alcohol, beta-hydroxyethyldimethylamine and deanol, is an organic compound. It is a choline molecule that has been used to improve memory and concentration. Some studies have shown that an increase in vigilance and alertness resulted following administration of DMAE, vitamins, and minerals. While long term studies have not been undertaken, nutritional uses for the molecule include boosting immunity, energy, anti-aging effects, weight loss, and aggression. In some embodiments, the composition comprises xylitol. Xylitol is an organic compound with the formula (CHOH)3(CH2OH)2. Xylitol is a naturally occurring sugar substitute. It is a sugar alcohol sweetener found in the fibers of many fruits and vegetables, including various berries, corn husks, oats, and mushrooms. Xylitol differs from other sweeteners such as sorbitol, fructose and glucose in that the Xylitol molecule contains five carbons instead of six. In some embodiments, the composition comprises potassium bicarbonate. Also known as potassium hydrogen carbonate or potassium acid carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, KHCO3, has been used as a dietary supplement as a source of potassium and as an antacid. Accordingly, the potassium bicarbonate may provide a source of minerals. In some embodiments, the composition may therefore include one or more dietary minerals, i.e. an inorganic element that is essential for human nutrition or promote certain physiological functions, including but not limited to calcium, phosphorous, selenium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc, and iodine.

Five individuals, four men and one woman, were used in the test population. Each of the individuals was allowed to consume beverages containing alcohol, such as beer or liquor, over a specific time such that their blood alcohol levels were over the legal driving limits of 0.08. Since a person found driving with a blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) level exceeding the legal limit can be arrested and charged with the offense of driving under the influence (DUI), this was the value chosen as a comparison point. However, the compositions in accordance with the instant invention can be effective in individuals who have lower BAC levels as well. A standard breathalyzer machine, such as the Intoxilyzer 8000 (CMI, Inc. Owensboro, Ky.) or portable breathalyzer machines, such as AlcoHawk (Q3 Asset Acquisition, LLC, Independence, Iowa) which measures the blood-alcohol concentration was used to determine the levels of alcohol in each of the individual's system. In addition to measuring the blood alcohol level, each of the individuals was tested to examine their facultative and physical capabilities in order to determine effects and improvement to the individual's cognitive capabilities or behaviors. Such testing is similar to field sobriety tests performed by police offers in the field when the officers encounter drivers they believe exhibit characteristics of drunk driving, and/or asked to comment about their state of drunkenness. Table 1 below summarizes the results for all individuals that participated in the experiment.
