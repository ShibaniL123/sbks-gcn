The present invention refers to a system and process for rare earth extraction from monazite ore, bastnasite ore, ore beneficiation or industrial waste containing rare earth elements as oxide, phosphate, sulfate or carbonates. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conventional leaching process for rare earth elements requires a large amount of acid, since some rare earth elements may be associated with iron and aluminum containing materials. Monazite and bastnasite ores and iron scrap containing rare earth elements are example of those types of materials, and its composition leads to high acid consumption, since the iron and aluminum are also responsible for acid consumption. These processes are often unfeasible. Gupta, C. K. and Krishnamurthy, Extractive Metallurgy of Rare Earths, CRC press, disclose conventional rare earth processing options. The treatment with sulfuric acid is usually carried out in two stages, using 93% acid, temperatures between 210 and 230° C. and dissolving the rare earth sulfate by addition of water. With this method, depending on the acid/ore ratio, temperature and concentration, either thorium or rare earths may be selectively solubilized or both thorium and rare earths totally solubilized. Since the reaction is strongly exothermic, there is a limit to the addition of acid, but below 200° C. the reaction proceeds very slow. In the caustic process, after the reaction is processed, the mixture is cooled to 70° C. and diluted about ten times in cold water. Rare earths and thorium salts stay in solution while the insoluble portion quickly precipitates due to the high density. The phosphate content of the ore is recovered as a marketable by-product, trisodium phosphate, at the beginning of the flowchart, and this has been a major attraction for the commercial use of this process. In the usual industrial practice, fine ground monazite is attacked with 60-70% sodium hydroxide solution at 140-150° C. In the Soviet practice, the grinding and caustic digestion are performed in one step and this enables about 50% savings in caustic soda consumption. Krumholz (1957) achieved a clean separation by digesting the ore with caustic soda at 170° C. under a pressure of several atmospheres. The mixed rare earth thorium hydroxide cake is processed for rare earths and thorium recovery by a variety of methods. Document U.S. Ser. No. 13/887,027, in the name of Vale S. A, discloses a system and method for rare earth extraction wherein rare earth from iron containing minerals can be selectively extracted. However, this process requires a long residence time in the furnace, and usually does not provide satisfactory results for high silica containing ore. Christoph Pawlik, Recovery of Rare Earth Elements from Complex and Low Grade Deposits, Uranium-REE conference, May 2013, ALTA 2013, Perth, Australia, (Uranium-REE Conference in Perth, Australia) discloses a review on the rare earth process, especially for low grade rare earth ore. Pawlik mentions the mineralogy dependence and several options for processing routes, proposing the conversion of rare earth in sulfates wherein the ore is mixed with concentrate sulfuric acid at temperatures between 150 and 250° C. However, this process requires a large amount of acid, due to the most of iron and aluminum are reacted into sulfates. Patent FR2826667, cited as prior to U.S. patent Ser. No. 13/887,027 discloses a first stage leaching with sulfuric acid is added to the ore, followed by calcination steps/burning (roasting) conducted at elevated temperature. Precipitation steps/extraction/isolation were also described in this document. This invention has several drawbacks, as a high acid consumption and the need of very high temperatures. The mechanism involved comprises the conversion all species in the ore into sulfates (including the impurities) and decomposing them at high temperatures into insoluble oxides, releasing SOx. This invention takes care of reducing the amount of impurities added but still needs a high amount of sulfuric acid to be added and high temperatures to decompose some of the formed sulfates. Unlike the present invention which has a lower acid consumption, lower temperature and furnace time. Further the above-mentioned documents fail on presenting the process condition, selective pyrolysis and reactions mechanism for better result control. The present invention provides a system and process aiming to reduce the furnace residence time, increase the performance on high silica containing ore, allowing the recovery of sulfur during pyrolysis stage and decreasing the sulfuric acid consumption. The controlled mixture stage allows rare earth conversion at low temperature, which is relevant for high silica containing ore, therefore increasing rare earth extraction and decreasing furnace time. SO3 is released during selective pyrolysis stage, increasing the conversion of iron and aluminum oxide in sulfates, enhancing the encounter probability between ion/aluminum sulfates and rare earth compound, increasing rare earth sulfate conversion and extraction. The pyrolysis products are easily leached, since most of them are oxides. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention refers to a process for rare earth extraction (lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, yttrium and scandium) from monazite or bastnasite bearing ores or ore beneficiation and industrial waste containing a variable amount of rare earth elements as oxides, phosphates, carbonates or sulfates and iron or aluminum. The process of the present invention comprises the following stages: (i) ore beneficiation, (ii) gas sulfation for sulfur recovery, (iii) controlled mixture, (iv) selective pyrolysis and (v) water leaching for rare earth sulfate dissolution. In the present invention, the control of the reaction mechanism is the core of the process, reflected in the controlled mixture stage and pyrolysis stage. In one aspect of the present invention, the sulfur recovery stage may be optional. In other aspect, as an optional stage, SO3 gas may be used in a sulfation stage, gas-solid reaction to be process prior to the controlled mixing stage. This stage partially converts part of ore components in sulfates, decreasing the overall acid consumption. SO3 gas may also be recovered by using a sulfuric acid plant, if available on site.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention refers to a process for rare earth extraction from monazite ore, bastnasite ore, ore beneficiation and industrial waste containing rare earth elements. In one aspect, the present invention refers to the effectiveness on the removing and separation of thorium from rare earth elements, wherein the process route consumes low amount of sulfuric acid, allowing the application for low grade ore and wastes. In another aspect, the present invention provides improvements on the process disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 13/887,027. The rare earth elements may be presented as phosphates, oxides or sulfates. The initial stage of the present invention encompasses the physical beneficiation steps, aiming rare earth content upgrade. After particle size reduction stage for rare earth element release, there is another stage of physical beneficiation so as to allow material upgrade, particularly relevant for low grade ore or waste, since it decreases the processing cost per ton of processed material. The rare earth content upgrade may be achieved by particle size classification (e.g., sieve or cyclone classification), gravity classification or flotation. This is an optional stage, and depends on the nature and composition of the material. The material is then transferred to the mixer and sulfuric acid is added. This stage is important for the final performance of the overall process, in particular for waste or ore containing high amount of silica. The rare earth conversion into sulfates starts in this stage. FIG. 1 shows the difference in efficiency obtained when the process described in U.S. Ser. No. 13/887,027 is applied compared to the present invention, in which controlled mixture stage was employed. The present invention also produces liquor with lower impurity concentration, obtained by leaching of the material after pyrolysis in the furnace, as can be seen in FIG. 2. More than 50% rare earth elements are converted into sulfates in the controlled mixture stage, making it possible to have a processing route containing only the controlled mixture stage and the aqueous leaching stage. FIG. 3 shows the rare earth extraction value as a function of mixing time. More vigorous mixing provides better results. The mixing time may range from 5 to 240 minutes, preferable between 5 and 45 minutes. Table 1 shows the reactions which may occur during this stage and during heating. The reactions kinetics may be enhanced by temperature, as can be seen in FIG. 11. A sufficient amount of sulfuric acid is added in order to react with rare earth elements and the primary consumers of acid, such as alkaline and alkaline earth metals. Those elements irreversibly react, and the consumed sulfur cannot be recovered. Most of iron and aluminum is not responsible for acid consumption. In some cases, more than 80% rare earth extraction may be reached by just applying the controlled mixture and water leaching stages. The controlled mixing stage allows the necessary contact between the sulfuric acid (added in small amount) and the target material, as well as the contact between the sulfates of iron and aluminum and the rare earth compound, solid-solid reaction showed in Table 1. The controlled mixture stage may be carried out in various types of equipment, for example, but not limited to, a pug-mill or an intensive mixture.

The temperature at this stage should be between 650° C. and 750° C., preferably between 680° C. and 720° C. The main purpose of pyrolysis stage is the decomposition of sulfates of deleterious elements such as iron, aluminum and thorium sulfates. In pyrolysis stage, the solid-solid reactions between sulfates and phosphates are enhanced due to an increase in kinetics. In temperatures higher than 335° C., non-reacted sulfuric acid decomposes, generating SO3 gas. SO3 gas flows through the furnace, reacting with oxides and generating more sulfates that will react with phosphates, increasing extraction efficiency. More SO3 gas is generated through the decomposition of deleterious sulfates, such as iron, aluminum and thorium, at temperatures close to 650° C., as illustrated in FIG. 10. FIG. 5 shows the temperature limit for rare earth sulfate decomposition. FIG. 6 shows the decomposition of iron sulfate (and subsequent SO3 gas release). The temperature gap between the rare earth sulfate and iron sulfate decomposition is the main factor for the process selectivity. FIG. 7 shows the decomposition of thorium sulfate, which leads to a reduced thorium solubility during the leaching stage. The SO3 released during the pyrolysis stage may be captured and re-used in the process. This recovery may lead to a significant decrease in sulfuric acid consumption, making the process route more economically attractive. The SO3 may be captured from the furnace out gas, and may be sent to the sulfuric acid plant for conversion to sulfuric acid. It may also be used to be contacted with feeding material before the controlled mixture stage. The SO3 reacts with oxides, such as Ca, Mg and rare earth, generating sulfates and reducing the acid consumption in the subsequent stage. If enough water is present, phosphate conversion in phosphate may also take place, leading to the conversion of rare earth present as phosphate into sulfate. The water may be added to the SO3 containing gaseous stream or may be directly added to the feeding material. Another possible source of water is from water containing compound decomposition, present in the feeding material. An example of such case is the water released by goethite present in some ores. Those possibilities for SO3 recovery and re-use are shown in FIG. 12, together with the overall process flowchart. The selective sulfates decomposition is dependent on the hydration form of the formed sulfate, therefore depending on the hydration form of the initial material. FIG. 8 shows thermodynamic calculations for the decomposition temperature as a function of the amount of hydration degree presented in iron sulfate compounds. If the decomposition window of the hydrated compounds is overlapped, a heating pre-treatment may be required. The same phenomenon occurs for rare earth sulfates. The theoretical decomposition temperature is the temperature when the Gibbs free energy is zero. The reacted material goes into a water leaching stage, with a controlled pH between 1.5 and 2.0. The process may take place at temperatures below 50° C., preferable at room temperature. The pulp concentration may range from 5-40%, preferable between 10-20%. The other downstream stages, such as purification and precipitation of rare earth elements are known for those skilled in the art. One possibility is the pH controlling the impurity removal and rare earth precipitation as oxalate, chlorides, double sulfates or hydroxides. EXAMPLES The following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention, and these are to be construed in a non-limitative manner. It is clear that various modifications in the process of the invention and in the choice of reactants might be resorted to by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention. Example 1 Rich rare earth ores used in the tests might be classified in poor and rich silica ore. Poor silica ore was beneficiated in order to separate the particles smaller than 74 μm, rich in rare earth elements. The beneficiation for this ore involves the screening in ¼ in, grinding the coarser to ¼ in minimum, mixing with fines passing in the screening ¼ in, scrubbing the mixture for 30 minutes and classifying in hydrocyclones with 74 μm cut-size. The fraction below 74 μm was dried and employed in the rare earth extraction tests. Rare earth contents in the fraction below 74 μm increased 1.68 times for Lithotype 1, 1.88 for Lithotype 2 and 1.67 for Lithotype 3. Rich silica content was grinding below 300 μm, dried and used to carry out the tests. Example 2 225.98 g beneficiated ore or Lithotype 1, dried and with particles 100% below 74 μm, was analyzed and mixed with 47.78 g sulphuric acid (98% w/w). The relation of sulphuric acid/beneficiated ore was of 211 kg/t. The acid was added to the sample, with mixing speed between 100-200 Hz for 15 min. The sulfated ore was kept in a mufle at 700° C. for 4 hours. Cured and sulphated ore was cooled down up to room temperature. The material was leached and filtered under vacuum condition to obtain a “rich rare earth sulphuric liquor”. The results are showed in Table 2.

The sulphate balance indicated that 60% total sulphate in mixture ore plus concentrated sulphuric acid was lost during the pyrolysis in mufle as SO3 gases. These gases could be used to react the feed ore before the reaction with sulphuric acid. Example 3 200.38 g beneficiated ore or Lithotype 2, dried and with 100% particles below 74 μm size, was analyzed and mixed with 68.13 g sulphuric acid (98% w/w). The relation of sulphuric acid/beneficiated ore was 340 kg/t. It was employed the same procedure above-described in Example 2. The results are showed in table 3.

It was extracted 76.10% feed REO and only 3.36% feed Fe2O3, the main deleterious in the beneficiated ore with a medium sulphuric acid per ton of beneficiated ore (340 kg/t). Sulphate balance indicated that 19% total sulphate in mixture ore plus concentrated sulphuric acid was lost during the pyrolysis in mufle as SO3 gases. These gases could be used to react the feed ore before the reaction with sulphuric acid. Example 4: 203.68 g beneficiated ore or Lithotype 3, dried and with 100% particles below 74 μm size, was analyzed and mixed with 50.74 g sulphuric acid (98% w/w). The relation of sulphuric acid/beneficiated ore was 250 kg/t. It was employed the same procedure above-described in Example 2. The results are presented in Table 4.

These gases could be used to react of the feed ore before the reaction with sulphuric acid. Example 5 Recovery and Re-Use of SO3(g) Released During Pyrolysis Stage Ore containing 4.7% rare earth (as oxides) was contacted with a stream of SO3(g) generated from the decomposition of sulfuric acid 104%.
