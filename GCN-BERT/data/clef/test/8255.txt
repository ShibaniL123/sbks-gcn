BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present invention relates to a liquid transport device and a pump unit. 2. Related Art Devices disclosed in JP-T-2002-505600, JP-T-2011-507555, and JP-A-8-206199 have been known as liquid transport devices for transporting a liquid into a living body. In these liquid transport devices, the device is attached and fixed to a surface of a living body while puncturing the living body with an injection portion (a catheter or the like) which injects the liquid. In a device disclosed in JP-T-2002-505600, a storage portion for storing the liquid and a pumping portion for transporting the liquid are not included in a component (a subcutaneous infusion set) which is attached to the surface of the living body. For this reason, although it is possible to realize the reduction of the size of the component which is attached to the surface of the living body, a hose is required to transport the liquid into this component and this hose is an obstacle in some cases. In a device disclosed in JP-T-2011-507555, a liquid storage portion or a pump mechanism is detachably provided in the component (a patch unit and a needle unit) which is attached to the surface of the living body. As such, if the device is configured to include the injection portion (the catheter or the like) which injects the liquid into the living body, and the storage portion or the pump mechanism which are attached to the living body, the component such as the hose disclosed in JP-T-2002-505600 is not necessary. Note that, in a case where the injection portion (the catheter or the like) which injects the liquid into the living body, and the storage portion or the pump mechanism are attached to the living body, the liquid transport device which is attached to the living body is likely to be increased in size. SUMMARY An advantage of some aspects of the invention is to realize the reduction of the size of a device. An aspect of the invention is directed to a liquid transport device which is attachable to a living body and transports a liquid into the living body, the device including a storage portion that stores the liquid; a pumping portion that transports the liquid in the storage portion to the living body by compressing a tube; and an injection portion that injects the liquid which is transported by the pump portion to the living body, in which the injection portion is disposed between the storage portion and the tube when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body to which the liquid transport device is attached. Other features of the invention will be clear by the description of the present specification and the accompanying drawings.

DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS At the minimum the following matters will be made clear by description of the present specification and accompanying drawings. There is provided a liquid transport device which is attachable to a living body and transports a liquid into the living body, the device including a storage portion that stores the liquid; a pumping portion that transports the liquid in the storage portion to the living body by compressing a tube; and an injection portion that injects the liquid which is transported by the pump portion to the living body, in which the injection portion is disposed between the storage portion and the tube when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body to which the liquid transport device is attached. Accordingly, it is possible to realize the reduction of the size of the liquid transport device. It is preferable that the storage portion and the pump portion are provided in a pump unit which is detachable from an injection set including the injection portion. Accordingly, it is convenient that the storage portion and pump portion can be detached from the injection set in a state in which the injection set is attached to the living body. It is preferable that the pump unit is mounted on the injection set while being rotated in an axial direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body to which the liquid transport device is attached. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce a load on the living body even when torque is transferred to the injection set at the time of being mounted thereto. It is preferable that the pump unit includes a liquid feeding port which protrudes toward the injection set and is elastically deformable, the injection set includes a liquid receiving port which protrudes toward the pump unit and is elastically deformable, and when the pump unit is mounted on the injection set, the liquid feeding port and the liquid receiving port are connected to each other while being elastically deformed. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress liquid leakage. It is preferable that the pump unit is configured to be mounted by covering the top of the injection set, a needle which is used when the living body is punctured with the injection portion pierces through the injection portion, and in a state before the needle is extracted from the injection portion, a member fixing an upper end of the needle protrudes from the upper side of the injection set and thus hinders the mounting of the pump unit. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress misuse. There is provided a pump unit which is detachable from an injection set attached to a living body and transports a liquid into the injection set, the unit including a storage portion that stores the liquid; a pumping portion that transports the liquid in the storage portion to the living body by compressing a tube; and a liquid feeding port that sends the liquid transported by the pump portion to the injection set, in which the liquid feeding port is disposed between the storage portion and the tube when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body to which the liquid transport device is attached. Accordingly, it is possible to realize the reduction of the size of the pump unit. First Embodiment Outline of Liquid Transport Device 1 FIGS. 1A and 1B are overall perspective views of a liquid transport device 1. FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the liquid transport device 1. FIGS. 3A and 3B are exploded views of the liquid transport device 1. In the following description, the side to which the liquid transport device 1 is attached (the living body side) is assumed to be “lower” and the opposite side is assumed to be “upper”. In addition, as illustrated in FIG. 2, a side on which a pumping portion 60 is provided with respect to a catheter 12 is assumed to be “front” and a side on which a reservoir 44 which stores the liquid is provided is assumed to be “rear”. The liquid transport device 1 is a device for transporting the liquid. The liquid transport device 1 includes an injection set 10 and a pump unit 30. The injection set 10 and the pump unit 30 can be separated from each other as illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B, but are integrally assembled when being used as illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 1B. The liquid transport device 1 is preferably used to, for example, periodically inject insulin which is stored in the pump unit 30 and attaches the injection set 10 to the living body. A connection portion 18 which protrudes upward is provided on the injection set 10. A hollow receiving portion 41 is provided in the center of the lower surface of the pump unit 30. The pump unit 30 is attached to the injection set 10 by inserting the connection portion 18 of the injection set 10 into the receiving portion 41 of the pump unit 30. At this time, a liquid receiving port 18A on the side surface of the connection portion 18 is connected to a liquid feeding port 41A of the receiving portion 41. The reservoir 44 and a pumping portion 60 are provided on the pump unit 30 as will be described later. The liquid of the reservoir 44 is sent from the liquid feeding port 41A to the injection set 10 by the pumping portion 60 and then injected to the living body from a catheter 12 of the injection set 10. Configuration of Injection Set 10 The injection set 10 is a unit for injecting the liquid into the living body. As illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the injection set 10 includes the catheter 12, a seal portion 14, and a pedestal portion 16. The catheter 12 is a tube for injecting the liquid into the living body. The catheter 12 is referred to as “cannula”, “cannulae”, or “soft needle (soft cannula)” in some cases. The catheter 12 is formed of a soft material, for example, fluororesin or the like. One end of the catheter 12 is fixed to the pedestal portion 16. The seal portion 14 is a part for attaching the injection set 10 to the living body or the like. The seal portion 14 is, for example, an adhesive pad of which the lower surface is formed of an adhesive seal. The pedestal portion 16 is a part for attaching the pump unit 30 to the living body. The pedestal portion 16 includes a base portion 17 and a connection portion 18. The base portion 17 is a part for supporting the pump unit 30 from the lower side. The connection portion 18 is a part protruding upward from the base portion 17 and a part which is inserted into the receiving portion 41 of the pump unit 30 (refer to FIG. 3B). The liquid receiving port 18A which is connected to the liquid feeding port 41A is provided on the side surface of the connection portion 18. In addition, an insertion port 18B of an introduction needle 21 (described later) is provided on the upper surface of the connection portion 18. FIGS. 4A and 4B are explanatory diagrams of cross sections of an injection set 10 before and after being attached to a living body. FIG. 4A is an explanatory diagram of a cross section of an injection set 10 before and after being attached to the living body. In this state, the introduction needle 21 is attached to the injection set 10, the introduction needle 21 pierces through the catheter 12, the seal portion 14, and the pedestal portion 16. An upper end of the introduction needle 21 is fixed to a knob 22. The knob 22 protruding from the upper surface of the connection portion 18 obstructs the mounting of the pump unit 30 in this stage. When the injection set 10 is attached to the living body, the user punctures the living body with the catheter 12 together with the introduction needle 21. Thereafter, as illustrated in FIG. 4B, the user takes the knob 22 of the introduction needle 21 to pull out (extract) the introduction needle 21 from the injection set 10. The catheter 12 remains in the living body, but since the catheter 12 is soft, the load on the living body is small. A septum for introduction needle 19 is provided on the lower side of the insertion port 18B, which is formed of a material (for example, rubber, silicon, or the like) blocking a hole generated when the introduction needle 21 is pulled out. After pulling out the introduction needle 21 from the injection set 10, the pump unit 30 is attached to the injection set 10. Configuration of Pump Unit 30 FIGS. 5A and 5B are exploded views of the pump unit 30. The pump unit 30 includes a driving unit 31 and a cartridge 40. The driving unit 31 is fixed to the upper side of the cartridge 40 by a screw. The driving unit 31 is a component for driving a cam 65. The cam 65 is exposed from the lower side of the driving unit 31 and a driving mechanism (not shown) driving the cam 65 is accommodated inside of the driving unit 31. The driving unit 31 accommodates a battery 32 serving as a source of power, and the battery 32 may be disposed on the cartridge 40 side. The cartridge 40 includes a cam accommodation portion 42 as illustrated in FIG. 5A. The cam accommodation portion 42 is provided on the upper side of the cartridge 40 (the driving unit 31 side), and is a part which is formed into a hollow shape and accommodates the cam 65 of the driving unit 31. A plurality of fingers 66 (refer to FIG. 6) are disposed on the periphery of the cam accommodation portion 42. When the driving unit 31 is fixed to the cartridge 40, and the cam 65 is fitted into the cam accommodation portion 42, thereby the pumping portion 60 to be described next is configured. Pumping Portion 60 FIG. 6 is an overview diagram of the pumping portion 60. FIG. 7 is an exploded view of the cartridge 40. The pumping portion 60 is apart serving as a pump for transporting the liquid. The pumping portion 60 includes a tube 62 and a compression mechanism 64. The compression mechanism 64 compresses the tube 62, thereby transporting the liquid. The compression mechanism 64 includes the plurality of the fingers 66 and the cam 65. The tube 62 is a tube for transporting the liquid. The upstream side of the tube 62 (the upstream side when based on the transport direction of the liquid) communicates with the reservoir 44 (refer to FIG. 2) storing the liquid. The downstream side of the tube 62 communicates with the liquid feeding port 41A (refer to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3B). The tube 62 is blocked when being pressed by the finger 66 and has elasticity to the extent of being restored to its original condition when the power is released from a finger 66. The tube 62 is partially formed into a circular arc shape. The center of an arc of the tube 62 matches a rotation center of the cam 65. The finger 66 is a member blocking the tube 62. The finger 66 is movably supported along an axial direction and is passively moved by receiving power from the cam 65. The plurality of fingers 66 are radially disposed from the rotation center of the cam 65 at equal intervals. The plurality of fingers 66 are disposed between the cam 65 and the tube 62. The cam 65 includes projection portions on four places on the outer circumference thereof. The plurality of fingers 66 are disposed on the outer circumference of the cam 65, and the tube 62 is provided on the outside of the finger 66. When the cam 65 rotates, seven fingers 66 are sequentially pressed by the projection portion, and the tube 62 is sequentially blocked from the upstream side in the transport direction. When the finger 66 is far from the projection portion, the shape of the tube 62 is restored to the original condition by an elastic force of the tube 62. Accordingly, the tube 62 is caused to perform peristaltic movement, and then the tube 62 is compressed to transport the liquid. In order to prevent the liquid from flowing backward, the projection portion of the cam 65 is formed such that at least one or preferably two fingers 66 block the tube 62. In the embodiment, in components of the pumping portion 60, the cam 65 is disposed on the driving unit 31, and the tube 62 and the finger 66 are disposed on the cartridge 40. Here, all components of the pumping portion 60 may be disposed on the driving unit 31 or the cartridge 40. In addition, the cam 65 and the finger 66 may be disposed on the driving unit 31 and the tube 62 may be disposed on the cartridge 40. Reservoir 44 FIG. 8A is an exploded view of a reservoir 44, and FIG. 8B is a top view of a cartridge main body 43. The cartridge 40 includes the reservoir 44 (the storage portion) for storing the liquid. A concavity 45 is formed on the cartridge main body 43, and a film 46 is fused to the periphery of the concavity 45. The reservoir 44 is configured to have the concavity 45 and the film 46. The liquid is stored between the concavity 45 and the film 46. Meanwhile, in a state in FIG. 7, the film 46 is adhered to the concavity 45 and there is no liquid in the reservoir 44. The concavity 45 is formed into a recessed shape from the upper surface of the cartridge main body 43 by a bottom 451 and periphery 452. The bottom 451 of the concavity 45 is flat whereas the periphery 452 of the concavity 45 is curved. Meanwhile, in the same way, in the case of the film 46 (film 46 in a state where there is no liquid in the reservoir 44) which is adhered to the concavity 45, the bottom is flat whereas the periphery is curved. The periphery 452 of the concavity 45 is configured to have, as will be described later; an outer periphery 452A, an inner periphery 452B, a periphery on an injection side 452C, and a periphery on a discharge side 452D, and these surround the concavity 45. The reservoir 44 is formed, when viewed from above, into a circular arc shape (alternatively a bow shape, a crescent shape, an oxbow lake shape, or a U shape) having the certain width. The outer periphery 452A of the reservoir 44 having the circular arc shape is disposed on the rear side of the pump and is formed into the circular arc shape which swells outside the reservoir 44 when viewed from above. The inner periphery 452B of the reservoir 44 having the circular arc shape is disposed so as to surround a half rear side of the receiving portion 41 (to avoid), and is formed into the circular arc shape which swells inside the reservoir 44 when viewed from above. The outer periphery 452A is more gently curved than the inner periphery 452B when viewed from above. That is, a curvature of the outer periphery 452A is smaller than a curvature of the inner periphery 452B, the radius of the curvature of the outer periphery 452A is larger than the radius of the curvature of the inner periphery 452B. An injection port 47 which injects the liquid into the reservoir 44 is provided at one end of the reservoir 44 having the circular arc shape, and a discharge port 48 which discharges the liquid from the reservoir 44 is provided at the other end of the reservoir 44. The injection port 47 is formed on the periphery on the injection side 452C which connects the outer periphery 452A and the inner periphery 452B. The injection port 47 is disposed to be close to the outside of the periphery on the injection side 452C. That is, the injection port 47 is disposed to be close to the outer periphery 452A side in the periphery on the injection side 452C. Accordingly, as will be described later, when the liquid starts to be injected into the reservoir 44, the liquid easily enters into the reservoir 44 along the outer periphery 452A (refer to FIGS. 9A and 9B). The discharge port 48 is formed on the periphery on the discharge side 452D which connects the outer periphery 452A and the inner periphery 452B. The discharge port 48 is positioned at the end of the reservoir 44 having the circular arc shape. Accordingly, as will be described later, when the liquid is injected into the reservoir 44, the gas is not likely to remain in the reservoir 44. Further, the discharge port 48 is disposed to be close to the inside of the periphery on the discharge side 452D. That is, the discharge port 48 is disposed to be close to the inner periphery 452B in the periphery on the discharge side 452D. Accordingly, as will be described later, when the liquid is injected to the reservoir 44, the gas is not likely to remain in the reservoir 44 (refer to FIG. 9C), and when the liquid of the reservoir 44 is discharged, the liquid is not likely to remain in the reservoir 44 (refer to FIG. 10B). As illustrated in FIG. 8B, width W2 of the center portion in the reservoir 44 having the circular arc shape is greater than width W1 (the width between the outer periphery 452A and the inner periphery 452B of the periphery on the injection side 452C) of the periphery on the injection side 452C. In addition, the width W2 of the center portion in the reservoir 44 having the circular arc shape is greater than width W3 (the width between the outer periphery 452A and the inner periphery 452B of the periphery on the discharge side 452D) of the periphery on the discharge side 452D. Accordingly, the capacity of the reservoir 44 can be increased, and the film 46 of the center portion in the reservoir 44 is easily deformed. The user punctures a septum for injection 49 of the cartridge 40 in a state of FIG. 7 (a state where there is no liquid in the reservoir 44) with an injector, and the liquid (for example, insulin) is injected into the reservoir 44 by using the injector. When the liquid is injected into the reservoir 44, the film 46 swells upward and the liquid is stored between the concavity 45 and the film 46. FIGS. 9A to 9D are explanatory diagrams illustrating a state of the reservoir 44 when the liquid is injected from the injection port 47. A hatched region in the reservoir 44 in FIGS. 9A to 9D represents a region into which the liquid enters (penetrates). In addition, a region which is not hatched in the reservoir 44 represents a region without the liquid and represents a region in which the concavity 45 and the film 46 are adhered to each other. When the liquid starts to be injected into the reservoir 44 from the injection port 47 in a state of having no liquid therein, as illustrated in FIG. 9A, the liquid enters into the region in the vicinity of a certain periphery on the injection side 452C of the injection port 47. Moreover, when continuously injecting the liquid, as illustrated by a white arrow in FIG. 9A, the liquid enters into the reservoir 44 along the outer periphery 452A, thereby entering a state illustrated in FIG. 9B. The reason for the liquid enters along the outer periphery 452A rather than the inner periphery 452B is that the outer periphery 452A is more gently curved than the inner periphery 452B, and thus the film 46 which is adhered to the outer periphery 452A is easily deformed compared to the film 46 which is adhered to the inner periphery 452B. Additionally, in the embodiment, since the injection port 47 is disposed to be close to the outside, the liquid more easily enters into the reservoir 44 along the outer periphery 452A. In addition, in the embodiment, since the width (the width W2 in FIG. 8B) of the center portion in the reservoir 44 is large and thus the film 46 of the center portion in the reservoir 44 is easily deformed, the liquid which enters into the reservoir 44 along the outer periphery 452A is easily expanded in the center portion of the reservoir 44. After the liquid enters along the outer periphery 452A, when the liquid is continuously injected, as illustrated by the white arrow in FIG. 9B, the liquid enters into the inner periphery 452B. In this manner, since the liquid sequentially enters into the inner periphery 452B after the liquid enters along the outer periphery 452A, even if the gas exists in the reservoir 44 before and after injecting the liquid, the gas moves to the inner periphery 452B, and thereby the gas is not likely to remain in the reservoir 44 (the gas is discharged from the discharge port 48 at the end). Further, when the liquid is continuously injected, as illustrated in FIG. 9C, the liquid enters into the region in the vicinity of the periphery on the discharge side 452D at the end. As described above, the film 46 of the outer periphery 452A is more easily deformed compared to the film 46 of the inner periphery 452B, and thus the liquid enters from the outer periphery 452A even when the liquid enters into the region in the vicinity of the periphery on the discharge side 452D, (refer to the white arrow in FIG. 9C). In the embodiment, since the discharge port 48 is disposed to be close to the inside, the gas is pushed out from the discharge port 48 and thus the gas is not likely to remain in the reservoir 44 even if the gas exists in the vicinity of the periphery on the discharge side 452D before injecting the liquid. Meanwhile, in the embodiment, the injection port 47 is disposed at one end of the reservoir 44 having the circular arc shape, and the discharge port 48 is disposed at the other end on the opposite side. For this reason, when the liquid is injected from the injection port 47, the liquid enters into each region of the reservoir 44 having the circular arc shape and then the liquid enters into the side of the discharge port 48 at the end. For this reason, the gas moves to the discharge port 48, and the gas is not likely to remain in the reservoir 44 even in a case where the gas exists in the reservoir 44 before injecting the liquid. As illustrated in FIG. 9D, after the liquid enters into a surface between the concavity 45 and the film 46, if the user further injects the liquid, the liquid is pushed out from the discharge port 48 and thus a flow path to the liquid feeding port 41A is filled with the liquid. Note that since the septum for injection 49 is disposed on the upper side of the cartridge 40, it is not possible to attach the driving unit 31 to the cartridge 40 at the time of injecting the liquid. For this reason, since the tube 62 is not blocked at the time of injecting the liquid (a state where the cam 65 is not in the cam accommodation portion 42, and the tube 62 is not blocked by the finger 66), the flow path to the liquid feeding port 41A can be filled with the liquid. A vent filter (refer to FIG. 13A) is attached to the liquid feeding port 41A in advance at the time of injecting the liquid. The vent filter is a filter through which the gas can pass, but the liquid cannot pass. At the time of injecting the liquid, the gas in the flow path passes through the vent filter and is pushed out to the outside before the liquid reaches the liquid feeding port 41A. In addition, at the time of injecting the liquid, when the liquid which is discharged from the discharge port 48 reaches the liquid feeding port 41A, it is possible to prevent the liquid from leaking to the outside by the vent filter. In this stage, if the user further injects the liquid, the liquid pressure in the reservoir 44 is increased and the film 46 of the reservoir 44 swells upward, the liquid is further injected between the concavity 45 and the film 46, and thus a sufficient amount of the liquid can be stored in the reservoir 44. After injecting the liquid into the reservoir 44, the user detaches the vent filter from the liquid feeding port 41A (refer to FIG. 13B), and then inserts the pump unit 30 into the injection set. Meanwhile, if the liquid is injected without the vent filter, since the liquid leaks to the outside from the liquid feeding port 41A, and the liquid pressure in the reservoir 44 is not increased, it is not possible to sufficiently store the liquid in the reservoir 44. Here, in a case where the resistance in the flow path is large, the liquid is stored in the reservoir 44 before the liquid reaches the liquid feeding port 41A, and thus the vent filter is not necessary in this state. FIGS. 10A and 10B are explanatory diagrams illustrating a state when the liquid in the reservoir 44 is discharged by the pumping portion 60. If the liquid in the reservoir 44 is continuously discharged by the pumping portion 60, the amount of the liquid in the reservoir 44 is decreased, and the concavity 45 and the film 46 of the reservoir 44 start to adhere to each other. As described above, since the film 46 of the outer periphery 452A is more easily deformed compared to the film 46 of the inner periphery 452B, as illustrated in FIG. 10A, the film 46 from the outer periphery 452A starts to be adhered to the concavity 45 in advance. Even after the film 46 of the outer periphery 452A is adhered to the concavity 45, the film 46 of the inner periphery 452B is not adhered to the concavity 45, and thus the liquid in the reservoir 44 is not likely to remain. If the film 46 is adhered to the concavity 45 of the center portion in the reservoir 44 in advance in a state where the liquid remains in the vicinity of the injection port 47, the liquid remains while the liquid cannot be discharged. However, in the embodiment, since the film 46 of the inner periphery 452B is not easily deformed and is not adhered to the concavity 45 as illustrated in FIG. 10A, the liquid in the vicinity of the injection port 47 passes through the vicinity of the inner periphery 452B and thus is discharged from the discharge port 48 through the shortest route. Further, if the liquid is continuously discharged, the liquid in the vicinity of the periphery on the discharge side 452D remains at the end as illustrated in FIG. 10B. As described above, since the film 46 of the outer periphery 452A is more easily deformed compared to the film 46 of the inner periphery 452B, the liquid from the outer periphery 452A is discharged first. In the embodiment, the discharge port 48 is disposed to be close to the inside, and thus the liquid is not likely to remain in the reservoir 44. Disposition of Catheter 12 FIG. 11A is an explanatory diagram of the positional relationship between the pumping portion 60, the reservoir 44, and the catheter 12 when viewing the liquid transport device from above. For convenience of explanation, some of components of the liquid transport device 1 are illustrated in perspective views. As illustrated in FIG. 11A, when viewing the liquid transport device 1 from above (when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body to which the liquid transport device 1 is attached), the catheter 12 and the liquid feeding port 41A are disposed between the reservoir 44 and the tube 62 (the pumping portion 60). As such, the catheter 12 and the liquid feeding port 41A are disposed, and thus the catheter 12 and the liquid feeding port 41A do not necessarily have to be disposed so as to protrude from the pump unit 30, therefore realizing the reduction of the size of the liquid transport device 1. FIG. 12 is an explanatory diagram of a liquid transport device 1 in a reference example. Although not shown, the reservoir 44 and the tube 62 (the pumping portion 60) are provided in the inside of the pump unit 30 in the reference example. In addition, in the reference example, the catheter 12 and the liquid feeding port 41A are provided on the outside of the pump unit 30 which includes the reservoir 44 and the tube 62 when viewing the liquid transport device 1 from above. For this reason, in the reference example, the catheter 12 and the liquid feeding port 41A are necessarily disposed to protrude from the pump unit 30, and thus the size of the liquid transport device 1 is increased. In the embodiment, the reservoir 44 is formed into the circular arc shape (the U shape), and the tube 62 is formed into the circular arc shape (the U shape) as well. In addition, the end portion (the discharge port 48) of the reservoir 44 having the circular arc shape is directed to the tube 62, and the end portion of the tube 62 having the circular arc shape is directed to the reservoir 44. For this reason, it is possible to shorten the flow path from the discharge port 48 of the reservoir 44 to the end on the upstream of the tube 62 and to shorten the flow path from the end on the downstream of the tube 62 to the liquid feeding port 41A. In addition, in the embodiment, the reservoir 44 and the tube 62 are disposed such that the end portions having the circular arc shape (the U shape) face each other. Accordingly, the receiving portion 41 having a hollow shape is easily formed between the two members. Then, as in the embodiment, if the receiving portion 41 and the liquid feeding port 41A are disposed on the inside of the region (the region surrounded by the two members) surrounded by a line which connects the end portions of the reservoir 44, the tube 62, and the reservoir 44 and the end portion of the tube 62, it is possible to realize the reduction of the size of the liquid transport device 1. If the liquid feeding port 41A is disposed on the inside of a region which is formed into a rectangular shape and connects four end portions of the reservoir 44 and the tube 62, it is possible to realize the reduction of the size of the pump unit 30. In addition, in the embodiment, curved portions of the two members having the circular arc shape (the reservoir and the tube 62) are disposed to face the outside. Accordingly, the pump unit 30 (or the cartridge 40) accommodating the two members is easily reduced in size. FIG. 11B is an explanatory diagram illustrating the movement of the pump unit 30 at the time of being mounted on the injection set. The user inserts the connection portion 18 of the injection set 10 into the receiving portion 41 of the pump unit 30, and then mounts the pump unit 30 on the injection set 10 while rotating the pump unit 30 in the axial direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body as illustrated in FIG. 11B. A stopper (not shown) is formed in at least one of the connection portion 18 of the injection set 10 and the receiving portion 41 of the pump unit 30 so that the rotation of the pump unit 30 stops at a position in which the liquid receiving port 18A of the injection set 10 and the liquid feeding port 41A of the pump unit 30 face to each other. In the embodiment, as described above, since the catheter 12 and the liquid feeding port 41A are disposed between the reservoir 44 and the tube 62 (the pumping portion 60), the catheter 12 is positioned in the vicinity of the rotation center of the pump unit 30. For this reason, as illustrated in FIG. 11B, when the pump unit 30 is mounted on the injection set 10 while being rotated, the load (pain) on the living body from the catheter 12 is small even though torque of the pump unit 30 is transferred to the injection set 10. FIG. 13B is a perspective view of the liquid feeding port 41A of a receiving portion 41 of the pump unit 30. The liquid feeding port 41A is formed of an elastically deformable rubber and is configured to protrude inward from the inner circumferential surface of the receiving portion 41 (in other words, protruding toward the connection portion 18 of the injection set 10). On the other hand, the liquid receiving port 18A of the injection set 10 (refer to FIG. 3A) is also formed of the elastically deformable rubber, and is configured to protrude outward from the side surface of the connection portion 18 (in other words, protruding toward the inner circumferential surface of the receiving portion 41 of the pump unit 30). When the pump unit 30 is mounted on the injection set 10, the liquid feeding port 41A and the liquid receiving port 18A are connected to each other. At this time, since the liquid feeding port 41A and the liquid receiving port 18A which protrude are connected while being elastically deformed, thereby being connected without a gap therebetween. Fixing Method of Pump Unit 30 In the case of the liquid transport device 1 in the reference example as illustrated in FIG. 12, the seal portion 14 is fixed to the entire lower surface of the pump unit 30. However, in the case of the reference example, since the lower surface (the sealing surface) of the seal portion 14 is formed into a planar shape, the liquid transport device 1 is easily detached from the flexible surface of the living body, or the surface of the living body is corrected to be formed into a planar shape by the flat sealing surface, and thereby the load (pain) on the living body is increased. On the other hand, the pump unit 30 needs to be large enough that the pumping portion 60 and the reservoir 44 can be accommodated therein and thus there is a limitation to the reduction of an area of the lower surface of the pump unit 30. In addition, the sealing surface of the seal portion 14 also needs to have a large enough area that the liquid transport device 1 can be fixed to the surface of the living body, and thus there is a limitation to the reduction of the seal portion 14. Thus, in the embodiment, as described below, by disposing the lower surface of the pump unit 30 to be floated from the seal portion 14, the pump unit 30 is easily fixed to the flexible surface of the living body and a load on the living body is reduced while securing areas for the lower surface of the pump unit 30 and the sealing surface of the seal portion 14. As illustrated in FIG. 3A, the base portion 17 of the embodiment is configured as a disk shaped part which is smaller than the disk shaped seal portion 14. For this reason, the sealing surface of the seal portion 14 extends outward not only from the lower side of the base portion 17, but also from the outer circumference of the base portion 17. In addition, the base portion 17 is configured so that the upper surface of the base portion 17 is narrower than the lower surface of the pump unit 30. For this reason, if the pump unit 30 is supported on the base portion 17, a portion of the pump unit 30 protrudes from the base portion 17 (will be described later; refer to FIG. 14). The sealing surface immediately below the base portion 17 is formed into a solid planar shape according to the lower surface of the base portion 17. For this reason, when attaching the seal portion 14 to the surface of the living body, the surface of the living body is corrected so as to be a planar surface by the sealing surface of the lower side of the base portion 17. Here, since the area of the base portion 17 is small compared to the entire area of the seal portion 14, the region in which the surface of the living body is corrected to be planar surface is small and thereby the load (pain) on the living body is reduced. The sealing surface which extends to the outside from the outer circumference of the base portion 17 causes the area of the sealing surface of the seal portion 14 to extend to the extent that the liquid transport device 1 is fixed to the living body. The sealing surface of the region is not fixed in the planar shape by the base portion 17, has flexibility, and thus can be deformed along the surface of the living body. For this reason, the sealing surface of the region is not easily detached from the flexible surface of the living body and thereby the load on the living body is reduced. FIG. 14 is a side view of the liquid transport device 1. When the pump unit 30 is mounted on the injection set 10, the lower surface of the pump unit 30 comes in contact with the upper surface of the base portion 17 (refer to FIG. 3A) of the injection set 10, and the pump unit 30 is supported by the base portion 17 of the injection set 10. As a result, as illustrated in FIG. 14, a portion of the pump unit 30 protrudes from the base portion 17. The base portion 17 has a predetermined thickness, and the gap G is generated by this thickness between a portion of the lower surface of the pump unit 30 (a portion protruding from the base portion 17) and the upper surface of the seal portion 14. That is, a portion of the lower surface of the pump unit 30 is far from the upper surface of the seal portion 14 (state of being floated from the seal portion 14). Since the gap G is present between the pump unit 30 and the seal portion 14, even after the pump unit 30 is mounted on the injection set 10, the sealing surface which extends to the outside from the outer circumference of the base portion 17 is not fixed in the planar shape by the lower surface of the pump unit 30, can continuously maintain flexibility, and thus can be deformed along the surface of the living body. For this reason, even after the pump unit 30 is mounted on the injection set 10, the liquid transport device 1 is not easily detached from the flexible surface of the living body, and thus the load on the living body is reduced. In addition, as illustrated in FIG. 14, the pump unit 30 further protrudes from the upper surface of the seal portion 14. In other words, the seal portion 14 can be configured to be smaller than the lower surface of the pump unit 30. In the aforementioned reference example, the seal portion 14 corresponding to the area of the lower surface of the pump unit 30 is attached to the living body, but in contrast, in the embodiment, the seal portion 14 can be made to be smaller than the area of the lower surface of the pump unit 30, and thereby the load on the living body can be reduced. Further, in the embodiment, the sealing surface of the seal portion 14 is disposed on the periphery of the catheter 12. Accordingly, when the injection set 10 is attached to the living body, since the periphery of the catheter 12 is fixed to the living body by the seal portion 14, the catheter 12 is not easily detached. Further, in the embodiment, the seal portion 14 on the periphery of the catheter 12 is positioned on the lower side of the base portion 17. For this reason, the surface of the living body is not easily moved on the periphery of the catheter 12, and thus it is possible to reduce the load on the living body from the catheter 12. Outline As described above, the liquid transport device 1 includes the reservoir 44 (the storage portion), the pump portion 60 which compresses the tube 62, and the catheter 12 (the injection portion). In addition, in the embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 11A, when viewed from above (when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body to which the liquid transport device 1 is attached), the catheter 12 is disposed between the reservoir 44 and the tube 62. Accordingly, in the embodiment, since the catheter 12 does not necessarily have to be disposed so as to protrude from the pump unit 30, it is possible to realize the reduction of the size of the liquid transport device 1 whereas in a case where the catheter 12 is disposed on the outside of the pump unit 30 as in the reference example in FIG. 12, it is not possible. In addition, in the embodiment, the reservoir 44 and the pump portion 60 are provided on the pump unit 30 which is detachable from the injection set 10 including the catheter 12. Therefore, the pump unit 30 can be detached from the injection set 10 in a state where the living body is punctured with the catheter 12, and thus it is convenient that, for example, the cartridge 40 can be exchanged or the liquid can be re-injected into the reservoir 44. Note that the reservoir 44, the pump portion 60, and the injection set 10 can be integrally formed. In addition, in the embodiment, the pump unit 30 is mounted on the injection set 10 while being rotated in an axial direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body as illustrated in FIG. 11B. Accordingly, the load (pain) on the living body due to the catheter 12 is small even though torque of the pump unit 30 is transferred to the injection set 10. Further, in the embodiment, the liquid feeding port 41A of the pump unit 30 is elastically deformable and protrudes toward the injection set 10. In addition, the liquid receiving port 18A of the injection set 10 is also elastically deformable and protrudes toward the pump unit 30. As described above, by configuring the liquid feeding port 41A and the liquid receiving port 18A, the liquid feeding port 41A and the liquid receiving port 18A which protrude are connected to each other while being elastically deformed, and thus are connected without a gap therebetween and the liquid leakage is suppressed. In addition, in the embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the pump unit 30 is configured to be mounted by covering the top of the injection set 10. On the other hand, as illustrated in FIG. 4A, the introduction needle 21 pierces through the catheter 12 (the injection portion) of the injection set 10 before attaching the pump unit 30 to the living body. In a state before the introduction needle 21 is extracted from the injection portion, the knob 22 (a member fixing an upper end of the injection portion) of the introduction needle 21 protrudes from the upper side of the injection set 10 and thus hinders the mounting of the pump unit 30. Therefore, it is possible to suppress misuse such that the pump unit 30 is mounted without extracting the introduction needle 21. In addition, in the embodiment, when viewed from above (when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body), the liquid feeding port 41A is disposed between the reservoir 44 and the tube 62. Accordingly, in this embodiment, it is not necessary to dispose the liquid feeding port 41A so as to protrude from the pump unit 30 and thus it is possible to realize the reduction of the pump unit 30 in size compared to a case where the liquid feeding port 41A is disposed on the outside of the pump unit 30 as in the reference example in FIG. 12. Second Embodiment In the aforementioned embodiment, the pumping portion 60 transports the liquid by compressing the tube 62 by the compression mechanism 64 which is configured to have the cam 65 and the finger 66. Here, the pumping portion 60 is not limited to the above described configuration. FIG. 15 is an overview diagram of the pumping portion 60 in the second embodiment. The compression mechanism 64 is configured to have rotatable members including a plurality of projection portions so as to block the tube 62. Also in a case where the pumping portion 60 is configured as described above, if the catheter 12 (the injection portion) is disposed between the reservoir 44 (the storage portion) and the tube 62 when viewed from the above (when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body, it is possible to realize the reduction of the size of the liquid transport device 1 whereas in a case where the catheter 12 is disposed on the outside of the pump unit 30 as in the reference example in FIG. 12, it is not possible. Third Embodiment In the aforementioned embodiments, when the pump unit 30 is mounted on the injection set 10, as illustrated in FIG. 11B, the pump unit 30 is rotated with respect to the injection set 10. In addition, the liquid feeding port 41A which is elastically deformable is provided on the inner surface of the hollow receiving portion 41 of the pump unit 30, and the liquid receiving port 18A which is elastically deformable is provided on the side surface of the connection portion 18 of the injection set 10, and the liquid feeding port 41A and the liquid receiving port 18A are connected to each other while being elastically deformed. Note that, amounting method or a connecting method of the injection set 10 and the pump unit 30 is not limited to the embodiment. FIG. 16 is an explanatory diagram of the third embodiment. The pump unit 30 includes the liquid feeding port 41 which extends downward in the inside of the receiving portion 41. When the pump unit 30 is mounted on the injection set 10, the pump unit 30 is mounted to cover the top of the injection set 10. At this time, the connection portion 18 of the injection set 10 is inserted into the receiving portion 41 of the pump unit 30, and the liquid feeding port 41A of the pump unit 30 is inserted into the insertion port 18B of the connection portion 18 and the septum for introduction needle 19, thereby transporting the liquid into the injection set 10 from the pump unit 30 via the liquid feeding port 41A. Although not shown in FIG. 16, also in the third embodiment, the liquid transport device 1 includes the reservoir 44 (the storage portion), the pump portion 60 which compresses the tube 62, and the catheter 12 (the injection portion). In addition, in the third embodiment, the catheter 12 is disposed between the reservoir 44 and the tube 62 when viewed from above (when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body to which the liquid transport device 1 is attached). In the third embodiment, since the pump unit 30 sends the liquid from the upper side of the connection portion 18 of the injection set 10, it is necessary to form a flow path extending to an upper end of the liquid feeding port 41A in the pump unit 30, and the thickness of the pump unit 30 is greater than that in the first embodiment; however, it is possible to realize the reduction of the size of the liquid transport device 1 whereas in a case where the catheter 12 is disposed on the outside of the pump unit 30 as in the reference example in FIG. 12, it is not possible. Fourth Embodiment FIGS. 17A and 17B are explanatory diagrams of the liquid transport device 1 before and after being attached to the living body in the fourth embodiment. In the fourth embodiment, members corresponding to the aforementioned driving unit 31 and the cartridge 40 are integrally formed to configure the pump unit 30. In addition, in the fourth embodiment, the pump unit 30 is configured that the seal portion 14 and the base portion 17 are integrally formed. As illustrated in FIG. 17A, the introduction needle 21 is attached to the liquid transport device 1 before being attached, and the introduction needle 21 pierces through the entire liquid transport device 1 and a lower end of the introduction needle 21 protrudes from the lower side of the catheter 12. The user attaches the liquid transport device 1 to the living body while puncturing the living body with the catheter 12 together with the introduction needle 21. Thereafter, as illustrated in FIG. 17B, the user takes the knob 22 of the introduction needle 21 to pull out the introduction needle 21 from the liquid transport device 1. A configuration may be adopted that the living body is punctured with the combination of the introduction needle 21 and the catheter 12 through the liquid transport device 1 after the user attaches the liquid transport device 1 to the living body. Although not shown in FIGS. 17A and 17B, also in the fourth embodiment, the liquid transport device 1 includes the reservoir 44 (the storage portion), the pump portion 60 which compresses the tube 62, and the catheter 12 (the injection portion). In addition, in the fourth embodiment, when viewed from above (when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the surface of the living body to which the liquid transport device 1 is attached), the catheter 12 is disposed between the reservoir 44 and the tube 62. Accordingly, it is possible to realize the reduction of the size of the liquid transport device 1.
