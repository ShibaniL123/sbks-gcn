RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/928,130, filed Jan. 16, 2014. The entire content of this application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant global health problem, affecting over 5% of the world population (over 350 million people worldwide and 1.25 million individuals in the U.S.). Despite the availability of a prophylactic HBV vaccine, the burden of chronic HBV infection continues to be a significant unmet worldwide medical problem, due to suboptimal treatment options and sustained rates of new infections in most parts of the developing world. Current treatments do not provide a cure and are limited to only two classes of agents (interferon and nucleoside analogues/inhibitors of the viral polymerase); drug resistance, low efficacy, and tolerability issues limit their impact. The low cure rates of HBV are attributed at least in part to the presence and persistence of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes. However, persistent suppression of HBV DNA slows liver disease progression and helps to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapy goals for HBV-infected patients are directed to reducing serum HBV DNA to low or undetectable levels, and to ultimately reducing or preventing the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is a need in the art for therapeutic agents that treat, ameliorate or prevent HBV infection. Administration of these therapeutic agents to an HBV infected patient, either as monotherapy or in combination with other HBV treatments or ancillary treatments, will lead to significantly improved prognosis, diminished progression of the disease, and enhanced seroconversion rates.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Provided herein are compounds that are useful in the treatment and prevention of HBV infection in man. In a non-limiting aspect, these compounds may modulate or disrupt HBV assembly and other HBV core protein functions necessary for the generation of infectious particles by interacting with HBV capsid to afford defective viral particles with greatly reduced virulence. The compounds of the invention have potent antiviral activity, exhibit favorable metabolic, tissue distribution, safety and pharmaceutical profiles, and are suitable for use in man. The HBV capsid protein plays essential functions during the viral life cycle. HBV capsid/core proteins form metastable viral particles or protein shells that protect the viral genome during intercellular passage, and also play a central role in viral replication processes, including genome encapsidation, genome replication, and virion morphogenesis and egress. Capsid structures also respond to environmental cues to allow un-coating after viral entry. Consistently, proper capsid assembly and function of core protein have been found to be critical for viral infectivity. The crucial function of HBV capsid proteins imposes stringent evolutionary constraints on the viral capsid protein sequence, leading to the observed low sequence variability and high conservation. Consistently, mutations in HBV capsid that disrupt its assembly are lethal, and mutations that perturb capsid stability severely attenuate viral replication. The more conserved a drug target is, the fewer replication-competent resistance mutations are acquired by patients. Indeed, natural mutations in HBV capsid for chronically infected patients accumulate in only four out of 183 residues in the full length protein. Thus, HBV capsid assembly and function inhibitors may elicit lower drug resistance emergence rates relative to existing HBV antivirals. Further, drug therapy that targets HBV capsid could be less prone to drug-resistant mutations when compared to drugs that target traditional neuraminidase enzyme active sites. Reports describing compounds that bind viral capsids and inhibit replication of HIV, rhinovirus and HBV provide strong pharmacological proof of concept for viral capsid proteins as antiviral drug targets. In one aspect, the compounds of the invention are useful in HBV treatment by disrupting, accelerating, reducing, delaying and/or inhibiting normal viral capsid assembly and/or disassembly of immature or mature particles, thereby inducing aberrant capsid morphology and leading to antiviral effects such as disruption of virion assembly and/or disassembly, virion maturation, and/or virus egress. In one embodiment, a disruptor of capsid assembly interacts with mature or immature viral capsid to perturb the stability of the capsid, thus affecting assembly and/or disassembly. In another embodiment, a disruptor of capsid assembly perturbs protein folding and/or salt bridges required for stability, function and/or normal morphology of the viral capsid, thereby disrupting and/or accelerating capsid assembly and/or disassembly. In yet another embodiment, the compounds of the invention bind capsid and alter metabolism of cellular polyproteins and precursors, leading to abnormal accumulation of protein monomers and/or oligomers and/or abnormal particles, which causes cellular toxicity and death of infected cells. In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention cause failure of the formation of capsid of optimal stability, affecting efficient uncoating and/or disassembly of viruses (e.g., during infectivity). In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention disrupt and/or accelerate capsid assembly and/or disassembly when the capsid protein is immature. In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention disrupt and/or accelerate capsid assembly and/or disassembly when the capsid protein is mature. In yet another embodiment, the compounds of the invention disrupt and/or accelerate capsid assembly and/or disassembly during vial infectivity. In yet another embodiment, the disruption and/or acceleration of capsid assembly and/or disassembly attenuates HBV viral infectivity and/or reduces viral load. In yet another embodiment, disruption, acceleration, inhibition, delay and/or reduction of capsid assembly and/or disassembly eradicates the virus from the host organism. In yet another embodiment, eradication of the HBV from a host advantageously obviates the need for chronic long-term therapy and/or reduces the duration of long-term therapy. In one embodiment, the compounds described herein are suitable for monotherapy and are effective against natural or native HBV strains and against HBV strains resistant to currently known drugs. In another embodiment, the compounds described herein are suitable for use in combination therapy. In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be used in methods of modulating (e.g., inhibit or disrupt) the activity, stability, function, and viral replication properties of HBV cccDNA. In yet another embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be used in methods of diminishing or preventing the formation of HBV cccDNA. In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be used in methods of modulating (e.g., inhibit or disrupt) the activity of HBV cccDNA. In yet another embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be used in methods of diminishing or preventing the formation of HBV cccDNA.

Compounds of the Invention The present invention relates to the discovery of compounds that are useful in the treatment and prevention of HBV infection in man. In one aspect, the compounds of the invention are useful in HBV treatment by disrupting, accelerating, reducing delaying or inhibiting normal viral capsid assembly or disassembly of immature or mature particles, thereby inducing aberrant capsid morphology and leading to antiviral effects such as disruption of virion assembly or disassembly or virion maturation, or virus egress. In another aspect, compounds of the invention bind to core protein thereby inducing aberrant virion and leading to antiviral effects such as disruption of virion assembly, disassembly, maturation, or virus egress. The capsid assembly disruptors disclosed herein may be used as monotherapy or in cross-class combination regimens for treating HBV infection in man. Combination therapy with drugs exhibiting different mechanism of action (MOA) that act at different steps in the virus life cycle may deliver greater efficacy due to additive or synergistic antiviral effects. Clinically evaluated HIV treatment regimens have shown that combination therapy improves the efficacy of viral load reduction, and dramatically reduces emergence of antiviral resistance. Combination therapy for the treatment of Hepatitis C (HCV) virus infection has also resulted in significant improvement in sustained antiviral response and eradication rates. Thus, use of the HBV capsid assembly inhibitors of the present invention in combination with, for example, neuraminidase drugs, is likely to deliver a more profound antiviral effect and greater disease eradication rates than current standards of care. Capsid assembly plays a central role in HBV genome replication. HBV polymerase binds pre-genomic HBV RNA (pgRNA), and pgRNA encapsidation must occur prior to HBV DNA synthesis. Moreover, it is well established that nuclear accumulation of the cccDNA replication intermediate, which is responsible for maintenance of chronic HBV replication in the presence of nucleoside suppressive therapy, requires the capsid for shuttling HBV DNA to the nuclei. Therefore, the HBV capsid assembly disruptors of the invention have the potential to increase HBV eradication rates through synergistic or additive suppression of viral genome replication and to further reduce accumulation of cccDNA when used alone or in combination with existing nucleoside drugs. The capsid assembly disruptors of the present invention may also alter normal core protein function or degradation, potentially leading to altered MHC-1 antigen presentation, which may in turn increase seroconversion/eradication rates through immuno-stimulatory activity, more effectively clearing infected cells. In one aspect, drug resistance poses a major threat to current therapies for chronic HBV infection, and cross-class combination therapy is a proven strategy for delaying emergence of drug resistance strains. The capsid assembly disruptors of the present invention can, when administered alone or in combination with other HBV therapy, offer enhanced drug resistant profiles and improved management of chronic HBV.

In one embodiment, compounds described herein are present in optically active or racemic forms. It is to be understood that the compounds described herein encompass racemic, optically-active, regioisomeric and stereoisomeric forms, or combinations thereof that possess the therapeutically useful properties described herein. Preparation of optically active forms is achieved in any suitable manner, including by way of non-limiting example, by resolution of the racemic form with recrystallization techniques, synthesis from optically-active starting materials, chiral synthesis, or chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase. In one embodiment, a mixture of one or more isomer is utilized as the therapeutic compound described herein. In another embodiment, compounds described herein contain one or more chiral centers. These compounds are prepared by any means, including stereoselective synthesis, enantioselective synthesis and/or separation of a mixture of enantiomers and/or diastereomers. Resolution of compounds and isomers thereof is achieved by any means including, by way of non-limiting example, chemical processes, enzymatic processes, fractional crystallization, distillation, and chromatography. In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented herein. Compounds described herein also include isotopically-labeled compounds wherein one or more atoms is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds described herein include and are not limited to 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 36Cl, 18F, 123I, 125I, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 32P, and 35S. In one embodiment, isotopically-labeled compounds are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. In another embodiment, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium affords greater metabolic stability (for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements). In yet another embodiment, substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 15O and 13N, is useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds are prepared by any suitable method or by processes using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. In one embodiment, the compounds described herein are labeled by other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or chemiluminescent labels. The compounds described herein, and other related compounds having different substituents are synthesized using techniques and materials described herein and as described, for example, in Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991); Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals (Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989); Organic Reactions, Volumes 1-40 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991), Larock's Comprehensive Organic Transformations (VCH Publishers Inc., 1989), March, Advanced Organic Chemistry 4th Ed., (Wiley 1992); Carey and Sundberg, Advanced Organic Chemistry 4th Ed., Vols. A and B (Plenum 2000, 2001), and Green and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 3rd Ed., (Wiley 1999) (all of which are incorporated by reference for such disclosure). General methods for the preparation of compound as described herein are modified by the use of appropriate reagents and conditions, for the introduction of the various moieties found in the formula as provided herein. Compounds described herein are synthesized using any suitable procedures starting from compounds that are available from commercial sources, or are prepared using procedures described herein. In one embodiment, reactive functional groups, such as hydroxyl, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, are protected in order to avoid their unwanted participation in reactions. Protecting groups are used to block some or all of the reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. In another embodiment, each protective group is removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. In one embodiment, protective groups are removed by acid, base, reducing conditions (such as, for example, hydrogenolysis), and/or oxidative conditions. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and are used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl, in the presence of amines that are blocked with acid labile groups, such as t-butyl carbamate, or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.

The assay is based on the observation that the C-termini of the HBV core protein cluster together during capsid formation. This assay utilizes a mutant C150 HBV capsid protein where all wild-type cysteines are mutated to alanines, but a C-terminal cysteine residue is preserved and is labeled with fluorescent BoDIPY-FL dye. HBV C150Bo protein is highly fluorescent, however the fluorescence is drastically reduced during the capsid assembly process. Thus, the assay measures the ability and potency of test compounds to modulate capsid assembly by monitoring the fluorescence of the labeled capsid C150Bo protein. In a typical assay, the mutant HBV C150 protein (amino acids 1-150, C49A, C61A, C107A, 150C) is cloned into a T7 RNA-polymerase based expression vector, expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity as a dimer. The purified HBV core protein is desalted and labeled with BODIPY-FL Dye. In a non-limiting embodiment, the assembly assay is conducted in 96-well plate format. The assembly reactions are carried out in 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl. The compounds are pre-incubated with the HBV CA protein for 15 min, and the assembly reactions are initiated by addition of NaCl. The reaction is allowed to continue for 1 hour at room temperature. To determine the effect on capsid assembly, each test compound is initially screened at least 4 different concentrations in duplicates. Primary hits are compounds that show activity in the assembly assay at 10 uM. Identified primary hits are confirmed in follow-up studies as described elsewhere herein. Known modulators of HBV CA assembly, such as HAP-1 and BAY 41-4109, are used as control compounds in these experiments and exhibited EC50 values consistent with the literature. EC50 values for test compounds are determined via analysis of the dose-response curve. Selected compounds of the invention were assayed in the HBV assembly assay, as described above. The assembly assay was conducted in 96-well plate format. The assembly reactions were carried out in 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl. The compounds were pre-incubated with the HBV CA protein for 15 min, and the assembly reactions were initiated by addition of NaCl. The reaction was allowed to continue for 1 hour at room temperature. The 96-well plate assembly assay consistently had Z′ factors greater than 0.7 and were robust and reproducible both from plate-to-plate and day-to-day. To determine the effect on capsid assembly, each test compound was initially screened at 5 different concentrations: about 30 μM, 10 μM, 3 μM, 1 μM, and 0.3 μM in duplicates. Primary hits were compounds that show >50% activity in the assembly assay at about 10 μM and a representative group of these active compounds is shown in Table 4.

In the first anti-viral assay, the ability of compounds to inhibit HBV replication in an HBV-producing hepatoma cell line using the dot-blot method is evaluated. Briefly, confluent monolayers of HepG2-2.2.15 cells are incubated with complete medium containing various concentrations of a test compound. Three days later, the culture medium is replaced with fresh medium containing the appropriately diluted test compound. Six days following the initial administration of the test compound, the cell culture supernatant is collected, and cell lysis is performed. The samples are applied onto Nylos membranes and DNA is immobilized to the membrane by UV cross-linking. After pre-hybridization, the HBV probe is added and the hybridization is performed overnight. The membranes are exposed to the Kodak films; antiviral activity is calculated from the reduction in HBV DNA levels (EC50). The EC50 for antiviral activity is calculated from the dose response curves of active compounds. Assay performance over time is monitored by the use of the standard positive control compounds ETV, BAY 41-4109, and HAP-1. Compound cytotoxity (TC50) is measured in this same HepG2-2.2.15 cell line using a CellTiter Blue-based cytotoxicity assay employed as recommended by manufacturer (Promega). To confirm and expand these results, a second antiviral assay is carried out on active compounds using the stable HBV cell line HepG2.2.15 and measuring anti-HBV potency by real-time PCR and cytotoxicity by CellTiter Blue. In this assay, 24 hours after cell seeding, HepG2-2.2.15 cells are incubated with complete medium containing various concentrations of a test compound with BAY 41-4109 and HAP-1 used as positive controls. After three days, the culture medium is replaced with fresh medium containing the appropriately diluted test compound. The cell culture is collected six days following the initial administration of the test compound, followed by HBV DNA extraction using QIAamp 96 DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen). The extracted HBV DNA is diluted and analyzed by Real-Time PCR. A standard curve is generated by plotting Ct value vs the amount of HBV plasmid standard. Cytotoxicity is determined similarly to the above described method by applying a dye uptake method (CellTiter Blue kit, Promega). Selected compounds were tested for their activity and toxicity in cellular assay. In the first anti-viral assay, the ability of compounds to inhibit HBV replication in an HBV-producing hepatoma cell line using the dot-blot method was evaluated. Confluent monolayers of HepG2-2.2.15 cells were incubated with complete medium containing various concentrations of a test compound. Three days later, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the appropriately diluted test compound. Six days following the initial administration of the test compound, the cell culture supernatant was collected, and cell lysis was performed. The samples were applied onto Nylos membranes and DNA was immobilized to the membrane by UV cross-linking. After pre-hybridization, the HBV probe was added and the hybridization was performed overnight. The membranes were exposed to the Kodak films; antiviral activity was calculated from the reduction in HBV DNA levels (EC50). The EC50 for antiviral activity was calculated from the dose response curves of active compounds. Assay performance over time was monitored by the use of the standard positive control compounds ETV, BAY 41-4109, and HAP-1. Results for selected compounds of the invention are illustrated in Table 5. Cytotoxity (CC50) was measured in this same HepG2-2.2.15 cell line using a CellTiter Blue-based cytotoxicity assay employed as recommended by manufacturer (Promega).
