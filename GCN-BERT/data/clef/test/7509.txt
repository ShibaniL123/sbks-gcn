1,3-Bis(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-6-[(2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
To a solution of 520 mg (1.25 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 412A in 13 ml of methanol were added first 233 mg (2.88 mmol) of potassium cyanate and then, dropwise, 183 μl (2.13 mmol) of perchloric acid (70% in water). After stirring at RT for 6.5 days, the reaction mixture was admixed with semisaturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic extract was washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The remaining residue was purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8). Concentration of the product fractions gave a product that was still slightly contaminated and was purified further by preparative HPLC again [column: Kinetex C18, 5 μm, 100 mm×30 mm; eluent A: water+0.07% formic acid; eluent B: acetonitrile; gradient: 0.0-2.0 min 10% B, 2.2 min 20% B, 7.0 min 60% B, 7.5-9.0 min 92% B; flow rate: 70 ml/min; temperature: 25° C.; detection: 210 nm]. This gave, after concentration of the product fractions and drying of the residue under high vacuum, 87 mg (17% of theory) of the title compound
