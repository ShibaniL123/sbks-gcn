Example 6: Synthesis of Compound 13-Br-Moc
Compound 12-Br (3.5 g, 5.675 mmol), ammonium acetate (2.187 g, 28.375 mmol), ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (4 mL) and toluene (70 mL) were added into a three-necked bottle, then heated to 90Â° C. and stirred for 5 hours. After that the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and then ethyl acetate (100 mL) was added. The mixture was washed with brine (200 mL) twice. The organic phase was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent was distilled off to obtain the product (3.4 g, yield 100%).
