Example Compound 24
2-oxo-2-(phenylamino)ethyl 2-(2-methyl-1 H-indol-1-yl)acetate
To a solution of 2-hydroxy-N-phenylacetamide (29 mg, 0.19 mmol) and 2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-1-yl)acetic acid (36 mg, 0.19 mmol) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (5.0 mL) was added DCC (38 mg, 0.19 mmol) and DMAP (5 mg, 0.04 mmol) at room temperature under argon. After 4 h, the reaction mixture was filtered, the filter cake was washed with CH2Cl2 (20 mL), the combined organics were washed with aqueous NH4Cl (10 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by column chromatography (1% MeOH in CH2Cl2) gave 53.7 mg (88%) of the title compound
