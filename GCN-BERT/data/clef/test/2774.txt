1-[(3-methyl formate-pyridine-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-amino-piperidine-1-yl]-xanth ine
(1) The preparation of 1-[(3-methyl formate-pyridine-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-bromoxanthine
Adding 3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-bromoxanthine (2.0 g, 6.7 mmol), potassium carbonate (1.5 g, 12.6 mmol) and 2-bromomethyl-3-methyl formate-pyridine (1.7 g, 7.4 mmol) into a 100ml round-bottom flask, adding 20 mL of N,N-dimethylformamides in, heating to 80Â°C and stirring for 5 hours; after the reaction was completed, pouring the reaction liquid into ice water to precipitate solid, filtrating by air pump, washing solid with water and drying to obtain 2.5 g of yellowish solid, with a yield of 83%. ES-API(m/z):[M+H]+ 446.0.
