DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring to FIG. 1, a game caller 10 is shown for calling game such as a turkey. The game caller 10 includes a striker 12 and a pot 14. The pot has a friction surface 16 which may be made from slate, ceramic, or other suitable material. The striker 12 includes a body portion 18 and a peg 20 fixed to the body portion 18. The striker is made from a suitable material such as wood. When the tip 22 of the striker 12 is rubbed across the friction surface 16 of the pot 14, a game sound is made that simulates the call of the game such as a turkey. Referring to FIGS. 2-4, a striker 40 made in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention is shown. The striker 40 includes a body portion portion 42, a releasable locking device 44 secured to one end 46 of the body portion 42 and a peg 48 releasable secured to the body portion 42 via the releasable locking device 44. The releasable locking device 44 can take any of several forms such as a screw tightening lock or a push/pull type of lock. The body portion, near the end 46, can alternatively have projecting fork-type members that can bend slightly when a locking nut is secured to the body portion to force the projecting fork members into holding engagement with the peg. The inside portion of the releasable locking device and the body portion 42 are both hollow so as to receive the peg 48 to a selectable length, i.e., the peg 48 can be positioned and locked to the body portion 42 so that a desired length of peg extends from the body portion 42 and locking device 44. Not only can the length of the peg 48 extending from the body portion be selected, the present arrangement allows for easy changing and assembly of a striker using other pegs, such as pegs 50, 52, made of different materials, e.g., pine, hickory, oak, carbon fiber, etc. It has been discovered that the sound produced by the game caller depends on the material of the striker, e.g., composition of the peg, the length of the peg extending from the body portion, the length of the overall striker, composition and weight of the body portion of the striker, weight of the striker, the center of balance of the striker, and the intensity of firmness with which the striker is held by the user while making the game call sound. Wood has a varying density depending on the cellular structure and growth characteristics of the individual species. Some wood, such as cedar, are soft with a density of 380 kg/cu·m while others, such as ebony, are very hard with a density of 1100 kg/cu·m. Cedar, red 380 Cypress 510 Douglas Fir 530 Spruce (Canadian) 450 Spruce (Sitka) 450 The wood used to make the striker affects the sound produced. Pegs made of softer wood, e.g., those with a density of 25 lbs/cubic foot produce a better sound on a softer friction surface of the pot, e.g. slate. Hickory produces a better sound on a pot having a ceramic friction surface. The length of the peg extending from the body portion determines the frequency and oscillation pattern of the sound produced. Also, the density of the peg effects the frequency of the sound produced. A turkey, for example, makes a yelp that varies from 500 Hz to above 1400 Hz. A hickory peg, for example, may not satisfactorily cover the lower range frequencies of 500 Hz-800 Hz. The present arrangement thus allows for tuning of the game caller in the field (i.e., while hunting) by adjusting the peg length extending from the body portion and by selecting the appropriate peg made from a specific material to account for climate conditions, terrain, and response of the game to the game caller. If a turkey is not responding to the caller when the striker has a hickory peg, the peg can be changed to a peg made from a different material and the length of the peg extending from the body portion can be adjusted to change the sound frequency until a desired response is obtained from the game. In accordance with one example embodiment, pegs 48, 50, 52 are made from different density materials. Although wood has been mentioned, the pegs can be made from other materials such as carbon fiber, composite materials, etc. Length markings 60 are marked on each of the pegs to aid in selecting the extension length of the peg from the end of the body portion, and, in turn, aid in selecting a desired game call frequency. The releasable locking device 44, in accordance with one example embodiment shown in FIG. 4, has a through opening 70. The releasable locking device further includes a retaining collar 74 that is received between a threaded locking nut 76 and a threaded portion 78 on the body portion 42. The retaining collar 74 has tapered surfaces that are acted upon by the locking nut 72 and body portion 42 so that when the locking nut 76 is screwed and tightened onto the body portion 42, the retaining collar 74 compresses down onto the peg 48 holding the peg to the body portion 42. The retaining collar 74 may also be referred to as a compression collar. As will be appreciated, the peg length extending from the body portion can be selected and the releasable locking device 44 tightened to hold the peg 48 at the selected length. This adjustment affects the overall length of the striker. The body portion 42 has a hollow opening 80 to receive the second end of the peg. Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, an alternative releasable locking device 44′ shown using a push/pull ferrule 84 secured to the end of the body portion 42 for releasably locking the peg 48 to the body portion 42. The push/pull ferrule includes a push/pull locking member 86 that, when the member 86 is pushed in, allows the peg 48 to slide relative to the body portion 42. When the member 86 is pulled outward away from the body portion 42, it locks the peg 48 to the body portion 42 at the selectable length of the peg extending from the body portion. Referring to FIG. 7, another releasable locking device 44″ is shown. The body portion 42′ includes flexible fork extensions 90 extending from the end 92 of the body portion 42′. A threaded receiving portion 93 is located also at the end of the body portion and spaced away from the ends of the fork extensions 90. A locking collar 94 fits over the forks and dimensioned to contact the outer surface 95 of the forks 90. A locking nut 96 is dimensioned to fit over the locking collar 94 and has a surface 97 having a diameter less than that of the locking collar 94. When the locking nut 96 is threaded onto the threaded receiving portion 93 of the body portion 42′, the diameter of the forks decreases (the forks are forced radially inward) so as to engage and hold the peg 48 to the body portion 42′. It will be appreciated that an appropriate shaped locking nut could eliminate the need for the locking collar. From the above description of the invention, those skilled in the art will perceive improvements, changes and modifications. Such improvements, changes and modifications within the skill of the art are intended to be covered by the appended claims. 1.
