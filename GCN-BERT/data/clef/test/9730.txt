Step 1. Preparation of (2-ethyl)-thiophenol-methylphosphoric Acid Ethyl Ester
1.10 g of thiophenol and 1.88 g of potassium carbonate were dissolved in 45 ml of DMF solution, 1.65 g of phenylmethanesulfonic acid phosphoric acid diethyl ester was slowly dripped therein at room temperature and stirred at room temperature, TLC detection was performed and it was confirmed that raw materials no longer decreased after 2 hours, and the reaction was completed. Organic layer was extracted, combined and dried, and column chromatography was carried out to obtain 2.20 g of a yellow oily liquid (yield 88%). Mass spectrum MS of the compound: [M+H]+ 260.0.
