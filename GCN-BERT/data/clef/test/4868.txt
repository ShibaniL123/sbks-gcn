BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention relates to a lancet device which utilizes depth adjustment and a lancet removal system. Lancet devices are used to penetrate and puncture the skin in order to allow the taking of a blood sample for testing. The present device allows the user to more safely remove and replace a lancet after each use. 2. Discussion of Background Information Lancet devices are commonly used to prick the skin of the user so that one or more drops of blood may be extracted for testing. Some users, such as diabetics, for example, may have to test their blood sugar levels several times a day. This may be accomplished by the user using a simple needle. However, this procedure is often problematic for the user since the needle may be difficult to handle. Additionally, many users simply cannot perform the procedure owing to either a fear of needles or because they lack a steady hand. As a result, lancet devices have been developed which allow the user to more easily and reliably perform this procedure. Most lancet devices lack convenient and flexible adjustability. Such devices are typically made adjustable by switching their tips. U.S. Pat. No. Re. 32,922 to LEVIN et al. is one such device. That is, the user must remove one tip having a set depth and replace it with another having a different set depth. This, of course, creates the problem of storing the replaceable tips, which if not properly done, may result in their misplacement, damage, contamination, or the like. Typical lancet devices also require the user to handle the lancet during replacement and installation. An improved device would allow the user to more easily adjust the depth of penetration and would overcome some of the disadvantages described above. Moreover, since the skin thickness can vary slightly from user to user and finger to finger, a need exists for efficiently adapting the depth of penetration. For example, an index finger may be more calloused than a middle finger, and the more calloused finger will typically have thicker skin. By adjusting the depth of puncture so that the depth is no greater than necessary for extracting a required amount of blood, any pain experienced by the user may be minimized. The present device allows the user to more safely remove and replace a lancet after each use. What is needed is a lancet device which can accurately and precisely control the depth of penetration of the needle relative to the surface of the user's skin while also being easy to use. It is also desirable for the user to be able to use and adjust the depth penetrating setting with just one hand and/or with less effort that currently required with existing lancet devices. What is also needed is a lancet device which does not require the user to handle the lancets so as to prevent inadvertent pricking of the user's skin.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the present invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the present invention in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental understanding of the present invention, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the present invention may be embodied in practice. FIGS. 1-49 show one non-limiting embodiment of a lancet device LD. The lancet device LD includes the following main components: a housing or body 10 which preferably comprises housing parts 10A and 10B, a front cap 20, a back cap 30 which preferably comprises parts 30A and 30B, a trigger 40, a lancet advance button or member 50, a locking member 60, a lancet holding member 70, a depth adjustment or thumb wheel member 80, and three springs S1, S2 and S3. As can be seen in FIG. 1, the lancet device LD can preferably have, by way of non-limiting example, an overall length OL which is approximately 5 inches and an overall width or diameter (measured over the device's largest portion) of approximately 1.25 inches. The lancet device LD also preferably has an ergonomic shape such that it can be held comfortably in a user's hand such that the user can rotate (both clockwise and counterclockwise) the depth adjustment thumb wheel 80 with the user's thumb and index finger, as will be described in detail later on, to set the depth of penetration prior to use. The user can also depress and slide forward the advance button 50 in order cause a forward advance of a lancet and optionally simultaneously cause removal of the front cap 20, as will be described in detail later on. The user can also depress the trigger 40 with either the user's thumb of index finger. The only step which likely requires the user to use two hands, is the step of placing the lancet device LD is an armed or trigger-set position—which will be described in detail later on. As can be seen in FIGS. 2-4, the lancet device LD functions as follows: In the position shown in FIG. 2, the lancet device LD is shown in the static or initial position. This is the preferred position that the device would assume during shipping, storage, and after the device is triggered or fired. In this position, the drive spring S1 is in a relaxed or non-compressed or expanded position. The back or arming spring S2 is in a slightly compressed state so as to apply a biasing force that forces the back cap 30 to a forward-most position. The advance button 50 and the trigger 40 are also in an initial position. The slide spring S3 (not visible in FIG. 2) is in a slightly compressed state so as to apply a biasing force that forces the ejection slide member 50 to a rearward-most position. In the position shown in FIG. 3, the lancet device LD is shown in the loading, armed or trigger-set position. This is the position which arms the lancet device and occurs when the user moves the back cap 30 rearward to cause the deflecting member 72 to become releasably locked to the retaining shoulder RS. In this position, the spring S1 is in a compressed state or position. Spring S2 is in an almost relaxed or a more expanded state or position, but is still able to bias the back cap 30 toward an initial position. The arming or armed position shown in FIG. 3 can take place when the user grips the back cap 30 with one hand and the body 10 with the other hand and pulls the back cap 30 away from the body 10, and then lets go of the back cap 30. In the position shown in FIG. 4, the lancet device LD is shown in the firing or fired position. This is the position in which a user depresses the trigger 40 so as to cause the member 72 to deflect inwardly and release from the shoulder RS. This releases the energy stored in the spring S1 and causes the lancet holding member 70 to move forwardly, which automatically causes the lancet L to project out of the front surface of the front cap 20 and cause a puncture in a user's skin. Of course, the position shown in FIG. 4 merely shows a snap-shot of the lancet needle LN in the extended or puncturing position, i.e., defined by the puncturing depth PD. In actuality, the lancet needle LN would move from the position in FIG. 3 (fully retracted or trigger-set position) to that of FIG. 4 (fully extended or puncturing position), and then finally to that of FIG. 2 (initial position) in a fraction of a second. In the firing position, the spring S1 is in a substantially fully expanded position owing to the forward movement of the member 70 as caused by the rapid axial expansion of the spring S1 acting on the flange of surface 77c of member 70. After the member 70 moves to a maximum forward position shown in FIG. 4, as determined by contact between a free end of the lancet L and an inner surface of the front cap 20 and/or by contact between the projection 78 and projection 10B27, the spring S2, which has substantially reached a maximum amount of allowable compression, will expand axially back to an original position, which, in turn, places the lancet device LD back in the position shown in FIG. 2. At this point, the user has the option of activating the lancet advancing system LES (see FIGS. 7-9) in order to cause removal of the front cap 20 and to allow for removal of the used lancet L so that the next or a fresh lancet can be placed on the lancet holding member 70. With reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, it can be seen that the lancet device LD includes a removable front cap 20 which covers a front area of the lancet device LD that includes a front end of the lancet holding member 70 and a lancet L. The lancet L is axially retained inside an elongated cylindrical opening LRO (see FIG. 44) of the lancet holding member 70 by deflectable portions of the front end portion 71a which engages with an outer cylindrical surface of the lancet L. Thus, when the lancet holding member 70 moves axially within housing 10, the lancet L moves along therewith. As is apparent from FIGS. 5 and 6, the front cap 20 can be removably secured to the housing 10 via engagement between oppositely arranged projections 27 and grooves G formed in housing parts 10A and 10B. Other types of connections can be utilized such as a snap connection of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,434 to SCHRAGA and U.S. Pat. No. 6,530,937 to SCHRAGA. The disclosure of each of these documents is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety. In order to remove the front cap 20, the user can either rotate the front cap 20 relative to the housing 10 (by e.g., about 90 degrees) to cause the projections 27 to align with oppositely arranged axial slots AL and then simply pull the front cap 20 away from the housing 10 or the user can move the slide member 50 forward (see FIGS. 7 and 9) to cause the end 53 to move into engagement with end 21 of the front cap 20 and thereby cause the projections 27 to come out of snap engagement with the grooves G. The details of the lancet ejecting system LES will now be described with reference to FIGS. 7-12. FIG. 8 shows the system LES in an initial position. In this position, the slide member 50 has a button portion 51 abutting or substantially near surfaces 10A14 and 10B14 (see FIGS. 22 and 24). FIGS. 7 and 9 show the system LES in a final or activated position. In this position, the slide member 50 has a button portion 51 abutting or substantially near surfaces 10A15 and 10B15 (see FIGS. 22 and 24). A spring S3 is arranged in a retaining groove 10B26 and applies a biasing force against surface 10B20a and a surface of member 54 (see FIG. 12). In operation, the advance button 50 is slid forward from the position shown in FIG. 8 to the position shown in FIGS. 7 and 9. This causes compression of the spring S3 and causes the lancet engaging member 55 (which extends into the holding member 70 via the elongated slot 79) to engage or contact a rear end of lancet L. However, when the slide member 50 is slid forward slightly against the biasing force of spring S3, this initial forward movement of the slide member 50 automatically causes the locking member 60 to pivot about axle projection 10B10 so that projection 65 engages with shoulder 78 (see FIG. 10) of the lancet holding member 70. This pivoting movement of the locking member 60 occurs as a result of sliding interaction between the guide projection 64 and the guide groove 57. Continued forward sliding movement of the slide member 50 causes the lancet L to move or advance forwards (until finally ejected) while the lancet holding member 70 is axially retained by the locking member 60. This forward movement of the slide member 50 maintains the locking member 60 in the locking position because of continued engagement between the guide projection 64 and the guide slot 57. Although not shown in FIGS. 7-12, the end 53 also moves with button 51 and would cause the front cap 20 to be removed along with the lancet L. This causes the front cap 20 to be ejected and allows the user to install a fresh or new lancet L. The user can then release the advance button 50 (which will be automatically retracted by the spring S3) and re-install the front cap 20 in order to place the device LD back into an initial or intermediate position shown in FIG. 2. With reference to FIGS. 13-15 it can be seen that the user can set a depth of penetration of the lancet device LD before the device is triggered and/or after the device is triggered. This can occur by the user rotating the thumb wheel 80 in either clockwise or counterclockwise directions. Such rotational movement determines the maximum forward position of the lancet holding member 70 and specifically projection 74. This position of the projection 74 (which contacts one of the stop surfaces 86a-86f) also determines the amount of forward axial movement of the lancet holding member 70 as discussed above. This movement changes as a result of the rotational position of the surfaces 86a-86f of the thumb wheel 80 relative to the projection 74, such that when stop surface 86a of the thumb wheel 80 is contacted by projection 74, the holding member 70 moves axially forward by a greater amount (producing a deeper puncture) than when stop surface 86f of the thumb wheel 80 is contacted by projection 74 producing a shallower puncture). The user can distinguish which stop surface 86a-86f is located in a position to be contacted by projection 74 by viewing the corresponding indicia 88 (see FIGS. 34-36) through the window or opening 10A13 in the housing 10 (see FIG. 14). FIGS. 16 and 17 show how the lancet device LD can be armed or placed in the trigger-set position of FIG. 3. This is the position which arms the lancet device and occurs when the user moves the back cap 30 rearward to cause the deflecting member 72 to become releasably locked to the retaining shoulder RS (see FIG. 3). During this movement, the spring S2 is compressed. However, when the user releases his or her grip from the back cap 30, the spring S2 automatically causes the back cap 30 to move toward an initial position shown in FIG. 16. The user can grip the indentations 30A4 and 30B4 of the back cap 30 with one hand and the body 10 with the other hand and pull the back cap 30 away from the body 10, and then let go of the back cap 30. FIGS. 18 and 19 show how the lancet device LD can provide a indication to the user that the device is armed or placed in the trigger-set position of FIG. 3, thereby providing a safety feature. By way of non-limiting example, the trigger 40 includes an opening or transparent window 46 (see FIG. 38) which allows a user to see inside the device. As such, when the lancet holding member 70 is positioned in the position shown in FIG. 3, the indicator 73 (in the form of, e.g., a red dot) can be visible through the window 46 (see FIG. 43), thereby providing a visual indicator to the user of the armed position. Of course, when the lancet holding member 70 is in the position shown in FIG. 2, the indicator 73 (in the form of, e.g., a red dot) is not visible through the window 46, thereby providing a visual indicator to the user of the unarmed position. The details of the parts utilized in the lancet device LD shown in FIGS. 1-4 will now be described with reference to FIGS. 20-49. With reference to FIGS. 20-22, it can be seen that the upper housing part 10A includes a front end 10A1 having a partially cylindrical inner surface 10A4 and a partially cylindrical outer surface 10A3 which serves as a mounting area for the front cap 20 as well as a rear end 10A2. A generally helical groove G is arranged on the surface 10A3 of the housing part 10A and is configured to receive therein one of the projections 27 of the front cap 20. The semi-cylindrical portion 10A3 which (together with semi-cylindrical portion 10B3) is sized and configured to slidably and rotatably receive thereon the rear end of the front cap 20. The housing part 10A also has a main body portion 10A5 which is preferably ergonomically shaped. Oppositely arranged integrally formed projections 10A6 each extend or projects inwardly from the body portion 10A5 and includes a mounting opening which is sized and configured to receive therein one of the mounting projections 10B6. Oppositely arranged integrally formed projections 10A7 each extend or projects inwardly from the body portion 10A5 and includes a mounting opening which is sized and configured to receive therein one of the mounting projections 10B7. Oppositely arranged integrally formed projections 10A8 each extend or projects inwardly from the body portion 10A5 and includes a mounting opening which is sized and configured to receive therein one of the mounting projections 10B8. A centrally arranged mounting projection 10A9 extends inwardly from the body portion 10A5 and is sized to allow the thumbwheel 80 to be rotatably mounted thereto.
