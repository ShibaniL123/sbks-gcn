[Reaction Scheme 8-2] Synthesis of Compound 49
The same procedure as in Reaction Scheme 1-13 of Synthesis Example 1 was carried out, with the exception of using Intermediate 4-h and Intermediate 8-a instead of Intermediate 1-h and Intermediate 1-l, respectively, to afford Compound 49 (5.1 g): yield 39.5%
