FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to molecules such as peptides, polypeptides and proteins which interact immunologically with T lymphocytes in subjects having peanut allergy, or allergy to other tree nuts, and genetic sequences encoding same. These molecules are preferably immunmointeractive with T cells in subjects having an allergy to the Ara h 1 allergen. The molecules of the present invention are useful in the development of diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic agents for conditions characterised by an aberrant, inappropriate or otherwise unwanted immune response to Ara h 1 or derivative or homologue thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Bibliographic details of the publications referred to by author in this specification are collected alphabetically at the end of the description. The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that that prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in Australia. Peanut allergy is a life-threatening and incurable disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the general population (Husain et al. J Am Acad Dermatol. 66(1); 136-43, 2012, Burks, Lancet. 371(9623):1538-46, 2008). It is characterised by the sudden onset of anaphylaxis, which may occur with exposure to minute quantities of peanut proteins (Hourihane et al., J Allergy Clin immunol 100: 596-600, 1997; Pumphrey, Current Opinion in Allergy & Clinical Immunology. 4(4):285-90, 2004). Nut induced anaphylaxis is that most frequently associated with mortality or with life-threatening features (Bock et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 119(4):1016-8, 2007; Burks 2008, supra). Peanut proteins are frequently concealed within apparently safe food sources, such that accidental contact occurs for up to 50% of sufferers over a 5 year period (Sicherer et al., Paediarrics 102: e6, 1998). Not surprisingly, nut allergy is associated with significant psychological morbidity for sufferers and carers alike, akin to that suffered by those with chronic debilitating illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis (Primeau et al., Clin Exp Allergy 30: 1135-43, 2000; Kemp et al. Med J. Aust. 188(9):503-4, 2008). Cure, while being an imperative to remove nut allergy as a cause of mortality, is also necessary to remove the chronic psychological burden that peanut allergic subjects carry. To date, efforts at immunotherapy for peanut allergy have been met by extremely limited success. Nelson et al. have shown that tolerance of peanut can be induced using a rush immunotherapy protocol, but that tolerance is lost in approximately half of the subjects during maintenance dosing and additionally that injections are associated with frequent episodes of anaphylaxis in the majority of subjects during both the buildup and maintenance phases (Nelson et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol 99: 744-51, 1997). Oppenheimer et al. demonstrated similar findings within their study, again showing that active therapy is associated with a high rate of systemic anaphylaxis. Data collection in that study was terminated after the administration of peanut extract to a placebo randomised subject resulted in their death, highlighting the dangerous nature of this condition (Oppenheimer er al., J Allergy Clin Immunol 90: 256-62, 1992). Recent studies of oral immunotherapy with whole peanut flour provide encouragement that desensitization is feasible, but the observed adverse reactions highlight major safety concerns (Hofmann et al. J. Allergy Clin Immunol. 124, 286, 2009; Jones et al. J. Allergy Clin. Irnmunol. 24, 292, 2009; Clark et al. Allergy 64, 1218, 2009; Varshney et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 127(3):654-60, 2011; Varshney et al J Allergy Clin Immunol. 124(6):1351-2, 2009; Anagnosto et al. Clin Exp Allergy. 41(9):1273-81, 2011; Allen & O'Hehir. Clin Exp Allergy. 41(9): 1172-4, 2011; Yu et al. Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 159(2):179-182, 2012; Thyagarajan et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 126(1):31-2, 2010; Blumchen et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 126(1):83-91, 2010). Even with the exclusion of children prone to severe symptoms or asthma, two studies reported an anaphylactic episode, in one case during an initial food challenge (Clark et al. Allergy 64, 1218, 2009) and in the other during treatment of a child who had not previously experienced anaphylaxis (Hofmann et al. J Allergy Clin. Immunol. 124, 286, 2009). Development of novel strategies to overcome the morbidity associated with allergen immunotherapy depends on an accurate understanding of the immunological basis to successful immunotherapy, as well as its side-effects. It has long been established that morbidity due to allergen immunotherapy is due to the cross-linking of IgE, and that this action is not required for such therapy to be efficacious (Litwin et al., Int Arch Allergy Appl Imnmunol 87: 361-61, 998). It is also known that one of the critical actions of immunotherapy in producing tolerance is its ability to change the predominant specific T cell phenotype from a Tu2 to a regulatory phenotype. These regulatory T cells act via production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and/or TGFR. (Akdis & Akdis, J Allergy Clin Immunol. 123:735-46, 2009; Akdis & Akdis, Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery. 8:645-60, 2009; Akdis & Akdis, J Allergy Clin Immunol. 127:18-27, 2011). A key difference in antibody and lymphocyte responses is in antigen recognition, antibodies recognising conformational epitopes dependent on molecular tertiary structure, while CD4+ T cells recognise short linear peptides. This difference in antigen recognition is the basis to many novel strategies of immunotherapy, including that using peptides based upon T cell epitopes, B cell epitope mutants and altered peptide ligands (Rolland et al. Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121:273-284, 2009). Such methods all depend on the alteration or absence molecular tertiary structure, so that IgE cross-linking and effector cell activation is lost. Peptide immunotherapy is a method in respect of which evidence of efficacy exists, being documented for both cat dander allergy and bee venom allergy. Three different studies showed that, in the absence of any systemic side-effects, tolerance could be achieved for the major bee venom allergen Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) using T cell epitope-containing sequences (Muller et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 101: 747-54, 1998; Tarzi et al. Clin Exp Allergy. 36: 465-74, 2006; Fellrath et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 111: 854-61, 2003), while several studies have demonstrated that peptides based on the structure of the major cat allergen Fel d 1 can be used to induce diminished clinical responses (Norman et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med 154: 1623-8, 1996; Marcotte et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol 101: 506-13, 1998; Pene et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol 102: 571-8, 1998; Oldfield et al. Lancet 360:47-53, 2002; Alexander et al. Clin Exp Allergy 35: 52-8, 2004; Alexander et al. Allergy 60:1269-74, 2005). Most recently, a phase IIa trial confirmed the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of a seven-peptide mixture from Fel d 1 (Toleromune CatÂ®, Cicassia Ltd., Oxford, UK) (Worm et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 127: 89-97, 2011) with Phase Jib trials now underway (Moldaver & Larche. Allergy. 66: 784-91, 2011). Crucial to the development of such strategies is the retention of T cell epitopes, so that T cell phenotypic change can be induced. The ability to bind directly on to MHC class II molecules allows peptides to be presented by non-professional or immature APC without pro-inflammatory and co-stimulatory signals which promotes induction of tolerance, anergy and/or suppressive activity in responding T cells (Moldaver & Larche, Allergy 66: 784-91, 2011). This also allows peptides to be presented at higher frequency than peptides processed from the whole molecule (Santambrogio et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1999, 96:15056-61), and since they are also safer than whole allergen, peptides can be given at higher concentrations, thus repolarising T cell responses more effectively. Importantly, targeting T cells specific for dominant epitopes of major allergens can alter responses to whole allergen extracts (linked suppression). Many studies reporting successful peptide immunotherapy in murine models of allergy demonstrated that administration of dominant T-cell epitope peptides of major allergens induced tolerance not only to those peptides, but also to purified allergen and whole allergen extracts (Yang et al. Clin Exp Allergy 40(4):668-78, 2010; Yoshitomi et al. J Pept Sci. 13(8):499-503, 2007; Marazuela et al. Mol Immunol. 45(2):438-45, 2008; Rupa et al. Allergy. 67(1):74-82, 2012; Hoyne et al. J Exp Med. 178(5):1783-8, 1993; Hall et al. Vaccine. 21(5-6):549-61, 2003). Accordingly, there is a need to both identify the major peanut allergens and, further, to identify the T cell epitopes of these allergens. The identification characterisation, and analysis of these epitopes is critical to the development of specific diagnostic and immunotherapeutic methodology. To this end, although the Ara h 1 peanut allergen molecule has previously been the subject of analysis, the identification of the T cell core epitopic regions, which are essential to the development of an effective vaccine, has not been achieved. Still further, previous studies have been limited by the fact that they have been based on the use of HLA-DR tetramers thereby preventing detection of epitopes presented by other HLA types. Since the effectiveness of a vaccine across the general population necessitates that the epitopes in issue can be presented across a range of different HLA types, there is a need not only to identify the T cell epitopes within the Ara h 1 molecule but, further, to identify the epitopes which are both dominant and can be effectively presented by the diverse HLA types which are representative of the population. In work leading up to the present invention, dominant, HLA-degenerate Ara h 1 core epitopic regions have been identified. This group of core epitopic regions is unique in terms of its particularly high level of efficacy. Unlike the previously studied 20mer Ara h 1 peptides which were identified based only on their ability to exhibit some level of T cell reactivity, the sequences of the present invention are a selected set of core T cell epitope regions which are both immunodominant, relative to other Ara h 1 peptide fragments, and are also HLA degenerate in that they bind to two or more HLA types. Still further, these epitopic core regions are presented by HLA-DQ molecules. HLA-DQ molecules are more conserved in mixed populations than HLA-DR molecules. Accordingly, peptides presented on HLA-DQ enable broader population coverage. The identification of this specific group of core epitopic regions has facilitated, for the first time, the development of effective methods for the treatment of conditions characterised by aberrant, inappropriate or otherwise unwanted immune responses to Ara h 1 or derivative or homologue thereof, other tree-nut allergy or allergy to a composition, such as foods containing the Ara h 1 allergen. The identification of these epitopes has also facilitated the development of corresponding diagnostic technology.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is predicated, in part, on the identification of HLA degenerate Ara h 1 dominant T cell core epitopic regions. The identification of these immunodominant core epitopic regions has enabled improvement of diagnostic methodology and the development of significantly more efficacious therapeutic and prophylactic compositions and treatment approaches, than have been available to date, for conditions such as, but not limited to, peanut allergy. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is directed to a composition comprising one or more Ara h 1 T cell core epitopic regions selected from the list consisting of: (i) (SEQ ID NO: 1) FQNLQNHR (ii) (SEQ ID NO: 2) IVQIEA (iii) (SEQ ID NO: 3) NEGVIVKVSK (iv) (SEQ ID NO: 4) FGKLFEVK (v) (SEQ ID NO: 5) EVKPDKKNPQLQ (vi) (SEQ ID NO: 6) EGALML (vii) (SEQ ID NO: 7) PHFNSKAMVIV (viii) (SEQ ID NO: 8) IVVVN (ix) (SEQ ID NO: 9) VVNKGTGNLEL (x) (SEQ ID NO: 10) IMPAAHP or functional derivatives or homologues thereof. In a related aspect the present invention is directed to a composition comprising one- or more peptides, each of which peptides is up to 60 contiguous amino acids in length and which peptides include one or more Ara h 1 T cell core epitopic regions selected from the list consisting of: (i) (SEQ ID NO: 1) FQNLQNHR (ii) (SEQ ID NO: 2) IVQIEA (iii) (SEQ ID NO: 3) NEGVIVKVSK (iv) (SEQ ID NO: 4) FGKLFEVK (v) (SEQ ID NO: 5) EVKPDKKNPQLQ (vi) (SEQ ID NO: 6) EGALML (vii) (SEQ ID NO: 7) PHFNSKAMVIV (viii) (SEQ ID NO: 8) IVVVN (ix) (SEQ ID NO: 9) VVNKGTGNLEL (x) (SEQ ID NO: 10) IMPAAHP or functional derivatives or homologues thereof. In one embodiment of the preceding aspects of the invention, said peptides or core epitopic regions are capable of modifying T cell function when presented to T cells isolated from subjects having a condition characterised by an aberrant, unwanted or otherwise inappropriate immune response to Ara h 1 or to an allergen present in a composition, such as food, comprising Ara h 1 but which peptides are unable to bind to Ara h 1-specific IgE. Without limiting the present invention in any way, peanuts contain many proteins, with the number of distinct bands visible on SDS-PAGE depending on the methodology used. Up to 53 bands are visible following high pressure liquid chromatography (de Jong et al., Clin Exp Allergy 28: 743-51, 1998). Only two of these proteins warrant classification as major allergens using standard criteria, whereby IgE reactivity occurs within greater than 50% of the peanut allergic population; these proteins are termed Ara h 1 and Ara h 2 (Burks et al., Allergy 53: 725-30, 1998). Although a number of studies have indicated Ara h 2 to be the more potent of these two allergens (Blanc et al, Clin Exp Allergy. 2009; 39(8):1277-85; Koppelman et al, Clin Exp Allergy. 2004; 34(4):583-90; Palmer et al, Clin Imnunzol, 2005; 115(3):302-12), Ara h 1 also plays a major role in the pathogenesis of peanut allergy, with numerous studies reporting strong correlations between symptom severity and IgE reactivity to both Ara h 1 and Ara h 2 (Glaumann et al. Allergy. 2012; 67(2):242-7; Chiang et al. Pediatr Allergy Immunol. 2009; 21(2 Pt 2):e429-38; Asarnoj et al. Allergy. 2010, 65(9):1189-95; Moverare et al. Int Arch Allergy Immunol 2011; 156(3):282-90; Lin et al. J Microbiol Immunol Infect. 2012; Peeters et al. Clin Exp Allergy. 2007; 37(1):108-15). Ara h 1 is the most abundant major allergen in peanut, accounting for 12-16% of total peanut protein (Koppelman et al. Allergy. 2001; 56(2): 132-7). Still without limiting the present invention in any way, the Ara h 1 allergen is a 7S seed storage glycoprotein or vicilin. The concentration of Ara h 1 in peanuts increases with the size of the kernel (4-16 mg extracted Ara h 1/g peanut), so expression of the protein is associated with peanut maturity (Pomes et al. 2006, Clin. Exp. Allergy 36(6):824-30). Ara h 1 is a homotrimer held together through hydrophobic areas at the distal ends of the monomers, where most of the IgE binding epitopes are located. Each 64.5 kD monomer has a cupin motif which consists of two core Î²-barrels, each associated to a loop domain of Î±-helices. Reference to âAra h 1â should be understood as a reference to all forms of this molecule including reference to any isoforms which may arise from alternative splicing of Ara h 1 mRNA or functional mutant or polymorphic forms of Ara h 1. It should still further be understood to extend to any protein encoded by the Ara h 1 gene, any subunit polypeptide, such as precursor forms which may be generated, whether existing as a monomer, multimer or fusion protein. It also includes reference to analogues or equivalents of Ara h 1 such as may occur where a product which naturally comprises Ara h 1 is synthetically generated for the purpose of generating a product such as a food additive. The present invention thereby provides epitopes and methods for their-use in the diagnosis and treatment of any condition characterised by hypersensitivity to an Ara h 1 or Ara h 1-like molecule, such as peanut allergy or a tree-nut allergy, or an allergy to an antigen present in a composition, such as food, which composition also comprises Ara h 1. Preferably, said Ara h 1 comprises the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:11. Reference to âT cellsâ should be understood as a reference to any cell comprising a T cell receptor. In this regard, the T cell receptor may comprise any one or more of the Î±, Î², Î³ or Î´ chains. The present invention is not intended to be limited to any particular functional sub-class of T cells although in a preferred embodiment the subject T cell is a T helper cell and still more preferably a Th2-type cell and/or Treg cell. In this regard, reference to âmodifying T cell functionâ should be understood as a reference to modifying any one or more functions which a T cell is capable of performing. For example, the subject function may be proliferation, differentiation or other form of cellular functional activity such as the production of cytokines. In one embodiment the subject functional activity is proliferation. In terms of âmodifying the functionâ of T cells isolated from subjects having a condition characterised by an aberrant, unwanted or inappropriate immune response to Ara h 1 or to a composition which comprises Ara h 1, it should be understood that this is not necessarily a reference to modifying the function of all the T cells in a given biological sample but is likely, in fact, to reflect the modification of functioning of only some of the T cells in the sample. For example, only a portion of the T helper cells in a given T cell sample may functionally respond to contact with the subject peptide. Such a partial response should be understood to fall within the scope of the present invention. It should also be understood that the T cells which are derived from the subject may be freshly harvested T cells or they may have undergone some form of in vitro or in vivo manipulation prior to testing. For example, T cell lines may have been generated from the cell sample and it is these T cell lines which then form the subject derived T cell population which is tested in accordance with the present invention. To the extent that the subject functional activity is T cell proliferation, the T cell proliferation assay is preferably performed as disclosed herein. Still more preferably, the subject modification of T cell function is the induction of proliferation. In this regard, reference to âAra h 1-reactiveâ T cell should be understood as a reference to a T cell which responds functionally to HILA presentation of an Ara h 1 T cell epitope. Similarly, reference to âAra h 1-specificâ IgE should be understood as a reference to IgE directed to Ara h 1 B cell epitopes. Reference to an âaberrant, unwanted or otherwise inappropriateâ immune response should be understood as a reference to any form of physiological activity which involves the activation and/or functioning of one or more immune cells where that activity is inappropriate in that it is of an inappropriate type or proceeds to an inappropriate degree. It may be aberrant in that according to known immunological principals it either should not occur when it does so or else should occur when it does not do so. In another example, the immune response may be inappropriate in that it is a physiologically normal response but which is unnecessary and/or unwanted, such as occurs with respect to type-I hypersensitivity responses to innocuous allergens. In the context of the present invention, this immune response may be directed to Ara h 1 or it may be directed to a different allergen which is present in a composition together with Ara h 1. Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action, it has been determined that even where the hypersensitivity response is directed to an allergen other than Ara h 1, which allergen is present in a composition which nevertheless comprises Ara h 1, treatment via the method of the present invention which is directed to Ara h 1 nevertheless induces beneficial modulation of Th2 and Treg functionality such that the hypersensitivity which exists to the unrelated allergen is nevertheless reduced. Preferably said immune response is peanut hypersensitivity. By âpeanut hypersensitivityâ is meant the induction of clinical symptoms of IgE mediated peanut hypersensitivity. However, it should be understood that although clinical symptoms may be evident, not all such individuals would necessarily exhibit detectable levels of peanut specific serum IgE which is measured using the Kallestad Allercoat EAST System (Sanofi-Pasteur Diagnostics, USA), although such individuals should nevertheless be understood to fall within the scope of the definition of those exhibiting âpeanut hypersensitivityâ. Alternatively, testing may proceed utilising either the Pharmacia or the UniCap systems. Reference to âAra h 1 hypersensitivityâ should be understood to have a corresponding meaning in the context of reactivity to the Ara h 1 protein. In a further related aspect there is provided a composition comprising one or more peptides, each of which peptide is up to 60 contiguous amino acids in length and which peptides include one or more Ara h 1 T cell core epitopic regions selected from the list consisting of: (i) (SEQ ID NO: 1) FQNLQNHR (ii) (SEQ ID NO: 2) IVQIEA (iii) (SEQ ID NO: 3) NEGVIVKVSK (iv) (SEQ ID NO: 4) FGKLFEVK (v) (SEQ ID NO: 5) EVKPDKKNPQLQ (vi) (SEQ ID NO: 6) EGALML (vii) (SEQ ID NO: 7) PHFNSKAMVIV (viii) (SEQ ID NO: 8) IVVVN (ix) (SEQ ID NO: 9) VVNKGTGNLEL (x) (SEQ ID NO: 10) IMPAAHP or functional derivatives or homologues thereof, which peptides are capable of reducing Ara h 1 hypersensitivity or hypersensitivity to a composition comprising Ara h 1 when administered to a subject having a condition characterised by said hypersensitivity. The reduction of Ara h 1 hypersensitivity (and allergen hypersensitivity more generally) is discussed in more detail hereafter. Briefly, however, this may take the form of either partially or completely desensitising or tolerising an individual to Ara h 1 specifically or peanut or other proteins more generally. Reference to a âpeptideâ includes reference to a peptide, polypeptide or protein or parts thereof. The peptide may be glycosylated or unglycosylated and/or may contain a range of other molecules fused, linked, bound or otherwise associated to the protein such as amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates or other peptides, polypeptides or proteins. Reference hereinafter to a âpeptideâ includes a peptide comprising a sequence of amino acids as well as a peptide associated with other molecules such as amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates or other peptides, polypeptides or proteins. âDerivativesâ include fragments, parts, portions and variants from natural, synthetic or recombinant sources including fusion proteins, Parts or fragments include, for example, active regions of the subject peptide. Derivatives may be derived from insertion, deletion or substitution of amino acids Amino acid insertional derivatives include amino and/or carboxylic terminal fusions as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acids. Insertional amino acid sequence variants are those in which one or more amino acid residues are introduced into a predetermined site in the protein although random insertion is also possible with suitable screening of the resulting product. Deletional variants are characterized by the removal of one or more amino acids from the sequence. Substitutional amino acid variants are those in which at least one residue in the sequence has been removed and a different residue inserted in its place. An example of substitutional amino acid variants are conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine and alanine; valine, isoleucine and leucine; aspartic acid and glutamic acid; asparagine and glutamine; serine and threonine; lysine and arginine; and phenylalanine and tyrosine. Additions to amino acid sequences include fusions with other peptides, polypeptides or proteins. Chemical and functional equivalents of the subject peptide should be understood as molecules exhibiting any one or more of the functional activities of these molecules and may be derived from any source such as being chemically synthesized or identified via screening processes such as natural product screening. Homologues include peptides derived from varieties other than peanuts, such as peptides derived from other tree nuts. Analogues contemplated herein include, but are not limited to, modification to side chains, incorporating of unnatural amino acids and/or their derivatives during peptide, polypeptide or protein synthesis and the use of crosslinkers and other methods which impose conformational constraints on the proteinaccous molecules or their analogues. Mutants include molecules which exhibit modified functional activity (for example, Ara h 1 peptides which express one or more T cell epitopes but lack B cell reactivity). Examples of side chain modifications contemplated by the present invention include modifications of amino groups such as by reductive alkylation by reaction with an aldehyde followed by reduction with NaBH4; amidination with methylacetimidate; acylation with acetic anhydride; carbaminoylation of amino groups with cyanate; trinitrobenzylation of amino groups with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS); acylation of amino groups with succinic anhydride and tetrahydrophthalic anhydride; and pyridoxylation of lysine with pyridoxal-5-phosphate followed by reduction with NaBH4. The guanidine group of arginine residues may be modified by the formation of heterocyclic condensation products with reagents such as 2,3-butanedione, phenylglyoxal and glyoxal. The carboxyl group may be modified by carbodiimide activation via O-acylisourea formation followed by subsequent derivatisation, for example, to a corresponding amide. Sulphydryl groups may be modified by methods such as carboxymethylation with iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide; performic acid oxidation to cysteic acid; formation of a mixed disulphides with other thiol compounds; reaction with maleimide, maleic anhydride or other substituted maleimide; formation of mercurial derivatives using 4-chloromercuribenzoate, 4-chloromercuriphenylsulphonic acid, phenylmercury chloride, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol and other mercurials; carbamoylation with cyanate at alkaline pH. Tryptophan residues may be modified by, for example, oxidation with N-bromosuccinimide or alkylation of the indole ring with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide or sulphenyl halides. Tyrosine residues on the other hand, may be altered by nitration with tetranitromethane to form a 3-nitrotyrosine derivative. Modification of the imidazole ring of a histidine residue may be accomplished by alkylation with iodoacetic acid derivatives or N-carboethoxylation with diethylpyrocarbonate. Examples of incorporating unnatural amino acids and derivatives during protein synthesis include, but are not limited to, use of norleucine, 4-amino butyric acid, 4-amino-3-hydroxy-5-phenylpentanoic acid, 6-arninohexanoic acid, t-butylglycine, norvaline, phenylglycine, ornithine, sarcosine, 4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid, 2-thienyl alanine and/or D-isomers of amino acids. A list of unnatural amino acids contemplated herein is shown in Table 1.

It is possible to modify the structure of a peptide according to the invention for various purposes such as for increasing solubility, enhancing therapeutic or preventative efficacy, enhancing stability or increasing resistance to proteolytic degradation. A modified peptide may be produced in which the amino acid sequence has been altered, such as by amino acid substitution, deletion or addition, to modify immunogenicity and/or reduce allergenicity. Similarly components may be added to peptides of the invention to produce the same result. For example, a peptide can be modified so that it exhibits the ability to induce T cell anergy. In this instance, critical binding residues for the T cell receptor can be determined using known techniques (for example substitution of each residue and determination of the presence or absence of T cell reactivity) In one example, those residues shown to be essential to interact with the T cell receptor can be modified by replacing the essential amino acid with another, preferably similar amino acid residue (a conservative substitution) whose presence is shown to alter T cell reactivity or T cell functioning. In addition, those amino acid residues which are not essential for T cell receptor interaction can be modified by being replaced by another amino acid whose incorporation may then alter T cell reactivity or T cell functioning but does not, for example, eliminate binding to relevant MHC proteins. In yet another example, mutant peptides may be created which exhibit normal T cell binding but abrogated IgE binding. Exemplary conservative substitutions are detailed in Table 2, below, and include: Original Residue Exemplary Substitutions Ala Ser Arg Lys Asn Gln, His Asp Glu Cys Ser, Ala Gln Asn Glu Asp Gly Pro His Asn, Gln Ile Leu, Val Leu Ile, Val Lys Arg, Gln, Glu Met Leu, Ile Phe Met, Leu, Tyr Ser Thr Thr Ser Trp Tyr Tyr Trp, Phe Val Ile, Leu Such modifications will result in the production of molecules falling within the scope of âmutantsâ of the subject peptide as herein defined. âMutantsâ should be understood as a reference to peptides which exhibit one or more structural features or functional activities which are distinct from those exhibited by the non-mutated peptide counterpart. Peptides of the invention may also be modified to incorporate one or more polymorphisms resulting from natural allelic variation and D-amino acids, non-natural amino acids or amino acid analogues may be substituted into the peptides to produce modified peptides which fall within the scope of the invention. Peptides may also be modified by conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) by known techniques. Reporter groups may also be added to facilitate purification and potentially increase solubility of the peptides according to the invention, Other well known types of modification including insertion of specific endoprotease cleavage sites, addition of functional groups or replacement of hydrophobic residues with less hydrophobic residues as well as site-directed mutagenesis of DNA encoding the peptides of the invention may also be used to introduce modifications which could be useful for a wide range of purposes. The various modifications to peptides according to the invention which have been mentioned above are mentioned by way of example only and are merely intended to be indicative of the broad range of modifications which can be effected. As detailed hereinbefore, the present invention provides peptides which retain all or some of their capacity to interact with T cells but exhibit partially or completely inhibited, abrogated or otherwise down-regulated antibody reactivity. Effecting the down-regulation of antibody reactivity can be achieved by any suitable method, which methods would be well known to those skilled in the art. For example, to the extent that a B cell epitope is defined by its linear amino acid sequence, one may add, delete or substitute one or more amino acid residues in order to render the mutated linear sequence distinct from the naturally occurring sequence. To the extent that an epitope may be additionally, or alternatively, defined by a conformational epitope, one may seek to disrupt that conformation by disrupting a 20 or, to the extent that homodimers or heterodimers exist, a structure of the peptide. This may be achieved, for example, by disrupting the formation of bonds, such as disulphide bonds, which are known to stabilise 2Â° and/or 3Â° structures. In terms of the T cell epitopes hereinbefore defined, these epitopic regions do not comprise B cell epitopes. The epitopes defined by SEQ ID NOs:1-10 are the T cell core epitopic regions of Ara h 1 which have been determined to also exhibit HLA degeneracy, in particular presentation by HLA-DQ, this being crucial in terms of developing an effective treatment regime. It should be understood that the composition of the present invention may comprise one of the listed core epitopic regions or it may comprise two or more of these core epitopic regions. In one embodiment, said composition comprises any two epitopic regions, three epitopic regions, four epitopic regions, five epitopic regions, six epitopic regions, seven epitopic regions, eight epitopic regions, nine epitopic regions or ten epitopic regions. In another embodiment there is provided a composition comprising one or more peptides, each of which peptides is up to 60 contiguous amino acids in length and which peptides include the epitope NEGVIVKVSK (SEQ ID NO:3) together with one or more Ara h 1 T cell core epitopic regions selected from the list consisting of: (i) (SEQ ID NO: 1) FQNLQNHR (ii) (SEQ ID NO: 2) IVQIEA (iii) (SEQ ID NO: 4) FGKLFEVK (iv) (SEQ ID NO: 5) EVKPDKKNPQLQ (v) (SEQ ID NO: 6) EGALML (vi) (SEQ ID NO: 7) PHPNSKAMVIV (vii) (SEQ ID NO: 8) IVVVN (viii) (SEQ ID NO: 9) VVNKGTGNLEL (ix) (SEQ ID NO: 10) IMPAAHP or functional derivatives or homologues thereof. In still another embodiment there is provided a composition comprising one or more peptides, each of which peptides is up to 60 contiguous amino acids in length and which peptide includes epitope EGALML (SEQ ID NO:6) together with one or more Ara h 1 T cell core epitopic regions selected from the list consisting of: (i) (SEQ ID NO: 1) FQNLQNHR (ii) (SEQ ID NO: 2) IVQIEA (iii) (SEQ ID NO: 3) NEGVIVKVSK (iv) (SEQ ID NO: 4) FGKLFEVK (v) (SEQ ID NO: 5) EVKPDKKNPQLQ (vi) (SEQ ID NO: 7) PHFNSKAMVIV (vii) (SEQ ID NO: 8) IVVVN (viii) (SEQ ID NO: 9) VVNKGTGNLEL (ix) (SEQ ID NO: 10) IMPAAHP or functional derivatives or homologues thereof. In accordance with these aspects, in other embodiments said composition includes at least three peptides, at least four peptides, at least five peptides, at least six peptides, at least seven peptides, at least eight peptides, at least nine peptides or ten peptides. As detailed hereinbefore, the composition of the present invention comprises HLA degenerate, Ara h 1 T cell core epitopic regions. These core epitopic regions may be administered as stand alone peptides or they may form part of a larger structure, such as a longer peptide or a non-peptide structure. As would be appreciated by the person of skill in the art, an epitopic region can sometimes be too small, in its own right, to induce an immune response. Haptens are an example of this type of opitope. The core epitopic regions of the present invention may therefore be formulated together with any proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous carrier molecule, so as to achieve the necessary level of immunogenicity. In one embodiment, the subject core epitopic regions form part of a larger peptide of up to contiguous amino acids in length. The subject peptide may be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30 amino acids in length. Preferably, the subject peptide is 12-25 amino acids in length, 15-25 amino acids in length, 15-20 amino acids in length, or 10-20 amino acids in length. To the extent that the composition is designed such that the core epitopic regions of the invention are included as part of a larger peptide, it should be understood that any given peptide may be designed to include one or more core epitopic regions. To this end, in one embodiment of the present invention, the one or more peptides of the subject composition are selected from the list: (i) (SEQ ID NO: 12) FQNLQNHRIV (ii) (SEQ ID NO: 13) RIVQIEAKPNTLV (iii) (SEQ ID NO: 14) FQNLQNHRIVQIEAKPNTLV (iv) (SEQ ID NO: 15) WSTRSSENNEGVIVKVSKE (v) (SEQ ID NO: 16) STRSSENNEGVIVKVSKE (vi) (SEQ ID NO: 17) ENNEGVIVKVSKE (vii) (SEQ ID NO: 18) NNFGKLFEVKPDKKNPQ (viii) (SEQ ID NO: 5) EVKPDKKNPQLQ (ix) (SEQ ID NO: 19) SNNFGKLFEVKPDKKNPQ (x) (SEQ ID NO: 21) NNFGKLFEVKPDKKNPQLQ (xi) (SEQ ID NO: 22) SNNFGKLFEVKPDKKNPQLQ (xii) (SEQ ID NO: 23) VEIKEGALMLPHFNSKA (xiii) (SEQ ID NO: 24) ALMLPHFNSKAMVIVVV (xiv) (SEQ ID NO: 25) KAMVIVVVNKG (xv) (SEQ ID NO: 26) AMVIVVVNKGTGNLELVAV (xvi) (SEQ ID NO: 27) VVNKGTGNEELVAVRK (xvii) (SEQ ID NO: 28) AMVIVVVNKGTGNLELV (xviii) (SEQ ID NO: 29) KAMVIVVVNKGTGNLELVAV (xix) (SEQ ID NO: 30) GDVFIMPAAHPVAINASS (xx) (SEQ ID NO: 31) VFIMPAAHPVAINASSE (xxi) (SEQ ID NO: 32) GDVFIMPAAHPVAINASSE (xxii) (SEQ ID NO: 33) VFIMPAAHPVAINASS In a further aspect of this embodiment, said composition comprises the peptide defined by SEQ ID NO:15, 16 or 17 together with one or more of the peptides defined by SEQ ID NOs:12-14 or 18-33.

In still yet another embodiment, said composition comprises the peptides defined by SEQ ID NOs:14, 15, 22, 23, 24, 29 and 30. In yet still another embodiment, said composition comprises the peptides defined by SEQ ID NOs:14, 15, 21, 23, 24, 29 and 32. In the context of the present invention, it should be understood that where reference is made to the use of the peptide defined by SEQ ID NO:14, this peptide may be substituted by: (i) the peptides defined by SEQ ID NOs: 12 and 13; (ii) the peptide defined by SEQ ID NO: 12; or (iii) the peptide defined by SEQ ID NO:13.

In a still further aspect of these embodiments, said composition comprises 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 of the listed peptides. In still another embodiment, said composition comprises all 7 peptides. The peptides of the present invention may be prepared by recombinant or chemical synthetic means. According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, there is provided a recombinant peptide or mutant thereof which is preferentially immunologically reactive with T cells from individuals with peanut hypersensitivity, which is expressed by the expression of a host cell transformed with a vector coding for the peptide sequence of the present invention. The peptide may be fused to another peptide, polypeptide or protein. Alternatively, the peptide may be prepared by chemical synthetic techniques, such as by the Merrifield solid phase synthesis procedure. Furthermore, although synthetic peptides of the sequence given above represent a preferred embodiment, the present invention also extends to biologically pure preparations of the naturally occurring peptides or fragments thereof. By âbiologically pureâ is meant a preparation comprising at least about 60%, preferably at least about 70%, or preferably at least about 80% and still more preferably at least about 90% or greater as determined by weight, activity or other suitable means.

In another aspect, the present invention provides a nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence of nucleotides encoding or complementary to a sequence encoding the epitopes and peptides as hereinbefore defined or a derivative, homologue or analogue thereof. It should be understood that reference to âpeptidesâ includes reference to peptides comprising one or more T cell epitopes. A nucleic acid molecule encoding the subject peptide is preferably a sequence of deoxyribonucleic acids such as cDNA or a genomic sequence. A genomic sequence may comprise exons and introns. A genomic sequence may also include a promoter region or other regulatory regions. The nucleic acid molecule may be ligated to an expression vector capable of expression in a prokaryotic cell (eg. E. coli) or a eukaryotic cell (eg. yeast cells, fungal cells, insect cells, mammalian cells or plant cells). The nucleic acid molecule may be ligated or fused or otherwise associated with a nucleic acid molecule encoding another entity such as, for example, a signal peptide. It may also comprise additional nucleotide sequence information fused, linked or otherwise associated with it either at the 3â² or 5â² terminal portions or at both the 3â² and 5â² terminal portions. The nucleic acid molecule may also be part of a vector, such as an expression vector. The latter embodiment facilitates production of recombinant forms of the subject peptide which forms are encompassed by the present invention. Such nucleic acids may be useful for recombinant production of T cell epitopes of Ara h 1 or proteins comprising them by insertion into an appropriate vector and transfection into a suitable cell line. Such expression vectors and host cell lines also form an aspect of the invention. In producing peptides by recombinant techniques, host cells transformed with a nucleic acid having a sequence encoding a peptide according to the invention or a functional equivalent of the nucleic acid sequence are cultured in a medium suitable for the particular cells concerned. Peptides can then be purified from cell culture medium, the host cells or both using techniques well known in the art such as ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, ultrafiltration, electrophoresis or immunopurification with antibodies specific for the peptide. Nucleic acids encoding Ara h 1 or peptides comprising T cell core epitopic regions of Ara h 1 may be expressed in bacterial cells such as E. coli, insect cells, yeast or mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO). Suitable expression vectors, promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements are referred to in Sambruck et al (1989). Other suitable expression vectors, promoters, enhancers and other expression elements are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of suitable expression vectors in yeast include Yep Sec 1 (Balderi et al., 1987, Embo J, 6:229-234); pMFa (Kurjan and Herskowitz., 1982, Cell., 30:933-943); JRY88 (Schultz et al., 1987, Gene., 54:113-123) and pYES2 (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, Calif.). These vectors are freely available as are baculovirus and mammalian expression systems. For example, a baculovirus system is commercially available (ParMingen, San Diego, Calif.) for expression in insect cells while the pMsg vector is commercially available (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) for expression in mammalian cells. For expression in E. coli suitable expression vectors include among others, pTrc (Amann et al., 1998, Gene., 69.301-315) pGex (Amrad Corporation, Melbourne, Australia); pMal (N.E. Biolabs, Beverley, Mass.); pRit5 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.); pEt-1 Id (Novagen, Maddison, Wis.) (Jameel et al., 1990, J. Virol., 64.3963-3966) and pSem (Knapp et al., 1990, Bio Techniques., 8:280-281). The use of pTRC, and pEt-1 Id, for example, will lead to the expression of unfused protein. The use of pMal, pRit5, pSem and pGex will lead to the expression of allergen fused to maltose E binding protein (pMal), protein A (pRit5), truncated-galactosidase (PSEM) or glutathione S-transferase (pGex). When a T cell epitope of Ara h 1 or a peptide comprising it is expressed as a fusion protein, it is particularly advantageous to introduce an enzymatic cleavage site at the fusion junction between the carrier protein and the peptide concerned. The peptide of the invention may then be recovered from the fusion protein through enzymatic cleavage at the enzymatic site and biochemical purification using conventional techniques for purification of proteins and peptides. The different vectors also have different promoter regions allowing constitutive or inducible expression or temperature induction. It may additionally be appropriate to express recombinant peptides in different E. coli hosts that have an altered capacity to degrade recombinantly expressed proteins. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to alter the nucleic acid sequence to use codons preferentially utilised by E. coli, where such nucleic acid alteration would not effect the amino acid sequence of the expressed proteins. Host cells can be transformed to express the nucleic acids of the invention using conventional techniques such as calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection or electroporation. Suitable methods for transforming the host cells may be found in Sambruck et al. (1989), and other laboratory texts. The nucleic acid sequence of the invention may also be chemically synthesised using standard techniques. In addition to recombinant production of peptides according to the invention, the nucleic acids may be utilised as probes for experimental or purification purposes. Identification and synthesis of the Ara h 1 T cell epitopes as disclosed herein now facilitates the development of a range of diagnostic and prophylactic/therapeutic treatment protocols for use with respect to peanut related immune conditions. Also facilitated is the development of reagents for use therein. Accordingly, the present invention should be understood to extend to the use of the peptides or functional derivatives, homologues or analogues thereof in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of patients. Such methods of treatment include, but are not limited to: (i) Administration of the subject peptides or mutants thereof to a patient as a means of desensitising or inducing immunological tolerance to Ara h 1 or Ara h 1-like molecules. This may be achieved, for example, by inducing Ara h 1 directed Th2 anergy or apoptosis. Such an outcome may be achieved by any one of a number of techniques including the use of peptides which maintain T cell epitope reactivity but which either naturally or as a result of mutation are unable to undergo IgE binding. Alternatively, one may utilise desensitisation/treatment protocols which are based on the administration of specific concentrations of a given peptide in accordance with a specific regimen in order to induce tolerance. Such methodology may eliminate Ara h 1 hypersensitivity or it may reduce the severity of Ara h 1 hypersensitivity or sensitivity to an allergen present in a composition comprising Ara h 1, such as a peanut allergy. Reference herein to the treatment of Ara h 1 sensitivity should be understood to encompass within its scope the treatment of conditions characterised by sensitivity to compositions which comprise Ara h 1, such as peanuts generally, even if the sensitivity is directed to an allergen other than Ara h 1. Preferably such treatment regimens are capable of modifying the T cell response or both the B and T cell response of the individual concerned. As used herein, modification of the allergic response of the individual suffering from peanut hypersensitivity can be defined as inducing either non-responsiveness or diminution in symptoms to the Ara h 1 molecule as determined by standard clinical procedures (Varney et al. 1991 British Medical Journal 302:265-269). Diminution in the symptoms includes any reduction in an allergic response in an individual to Ara h 1 after a treatment regime has been completed. This diminution may be subjective or clinically determined, for example by using standard skin tests known in the art.Exposure of an individual to the peptides of the present invention, which peptides comprise at least one T cell epitope, may tolerise or anergise appropriate T cell subpopulations such that they become unresponsive to Ara h 1 and do not participate in stimulating an immune response upon such exposure. Preferably the peptides according to the invention will retain immunodominant T cell epitopes but possess abrogated IgE binding. Still further, even if the allergen in issue is not Ara h 1, but is directed to a different allergen which is present in the same composition as Ara h 1 (such as a different peanut allergen) immunisation with Ara h 1 may nevertheless induce a bystander suppressive effect which acts to reduce the degree of hypersensitivity to that allergen.Administration of a peptide of the invention may modify the cytokine secretion profile as compared with exposure to naturally occurring Ara h 1 allergen. This exposure may also influence T cell subpopulations which normally participate in the allergic response to migrate away from the site or sites of normal exposure to the allergen and towards the site or sites of therapeutic administration. This redistribution of T cell subpopulations may ameliorate or reduce the ability of an individual's immune system to stimulate the usual immune response at the site of normal exposure to the allergen, resulting in diminution of the allergic symptoms.Modification of the B cell response may be achieved, for example, via modulation of the cytokine profile produced by T cells, as detailed above. Specifically, decreasing T cell derived IL-4 and IL-13 production thereby decreasing IgE synthesis.(ii) The peptides of the present invention may be used in the capacity of an adsorbent to remove Ara h 1 directed T cells from a biological sample or from a patient. Accordingly, in another aspect the present invention provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of a condition in a subject, which condition is characterised by the aberrant, unwanted or otherwise inappropriate immune response to Ara h 1 or an allergen in a composition comprising Ara h 1, said method comprising administering to said subject an effective amount of a composition as hereinbefore defined for a time and under conditions sufficient to remove or reduce the presence or function in said subject of T cells directed to said Arah 1 or other allergen. Preferably said condition is hypersensitivity to peanuts or tree nuts which contain Ara h 1 or Ara h 1-like molecules, such as hazelnuts, almonds or Brazil nuts. In one embodiment, said method desensitises or induces immunological tolerance to Ara h 1 or other allergen of said composition. In another embodiment, said desensitization or tolerance is achieved by inducing Th2 anergy or apoptosis. In still another embodiment, said desensitisation or tolerance is achieved by inducing Ara h 1-specific Treg cells. An âeffective amountâ means an amount necessary at least partly to attain the desired immune response, or to delay the onset or inhibit progression or halt altogether, the onset or progression of a particular condition being treated. The amount varies depending upon the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, the taxonomic group of individual to be treated, the degree of protection desired, the formulation of the composition, the assessment of the medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the amount will fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials. It should also be understood that the composition of the present invention may exclusively comprise Ara h 1 epitopes or it may also comprise other epitopes or molecules useful for achieving therapeutic efficacy, such as a range of Ara h 2 epitopes. The subject of the treatment or prophylaxis is generally a mammal such as but not limited to human, primate, livestock animal (e.g. sheep, cow, horse, donkey, pig), companion animal (e.g. dog, cat), laboratory test animal (e.g. mouse, rabbit, rat, guinea pig, hamster), captive wild animal (e.g. fox, deer). Preferably the mammal is a human or primate. Most preferably the mammal is a human. Reference herein to âtreatmentâ and âprophylaxisâ is to be considered in its broadest context. The term âtreatmentâ does not necessarily imply that a subject is treated until total recovery. Similarly, âprophylaxisâ does not necessarily mean that the subject will not eventually contract a disease condition. Accordingly, treatment and prophylaxis include amelioration of the symptoms of a particular condition or preventing or otherwise reducing the risk of developing a particular condition. The term âprophylaxisâ may be considered as reducing the severity or onset of a particular condition. âTreatmentâ may also reduce the severity of an existing condition. Administration of the peptide of the present invention (herein referred to as âagentâ) in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, may be performed by any convenient means. The agent of the pharmaceutical composition is contemplated to exhibit therapeutic activity when administered in an amount which depends on the particular case. The variation depends, for example, on the human or animal and the agent chosen. A broad range of doses may be applicable. Considering a patient, for example, from about 0.1 mg to about 1 mg of an agent may be administered per kilogram of body weight per day. Dosage regimes may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily, weekly, monthly or other suitable time intervals or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the situation. The agent may be administered in a convenient manner such as by the oral, intravenous (where water soluble), intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intranasal, sublingual or suppository routes or implanting (e.g. using slow release molecules). The agent may be administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts, such as acid addition salts or metal complexes, e.g. with zinc, iron or the like (which are considered as salts for purposes of this application). Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, maleate, acetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, malate, ascorbate, tartrate and the like. If the active ingredient is to be administered in tablet form, the tablet may contain a binder such as tragacanth, corn starch or gelatin; a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid; and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate. In accordance with these methods, the agent defined in accordance with the present invention may be coadmininistered with one or more other compounds or molecules, By âcoadministeredâ is meant simultaneous administration in the same formulation or in two different formulations via the same or different routes or sequential administration by the same or different routes. By âsequentialâ administration is meant a time difference of from seconds, minutes, hours or days between the administration of the two types of molecules. These molecules may be administered in any order. Another aspect of the present invention contemplates the use of a composition as hereinbefore defined in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a condition in a mammal, which condition is characterised by an aberrant, unwanted or otherwise inappropriate immune response to Ara h 1. Preferably said condition is hypersensitivity to peanuts or a tree nut which contains Ara h 1 or Ara h 1-like molecules, such as a hazelnut. In yet another further aspect, the present invention contemplates a pharmaceutical composition comprising a composition as hereinbefore defined together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents. Said composition is referred to as the active ingredients. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion or may be in the form of a cream or other form suitable for topical application. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of superfactants. The preventions of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilisation. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilised active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze-drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. When the active ingredients are suitably protected they may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or it may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, or it may be compressed into tablets, or it may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 1% by weight of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 5 to about 80% of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions in such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Preferred compositions or preparations according to the present invention are prepared so that an oral dosage unit form contains between about 0.1 g and 2000 mg of active compound. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the components as listed hereafter: a binder such as gum, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavouring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavouring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavouring such as cherry or orange flavour. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound(s) may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and formulations. The pharmaceutical composition may also comprise genetic molecules such as a vector capable of transfecting target cells where the vector carries a nucleic acid molecule encoding a modulatory agent. The vector may, for example, be a viral vector. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, respiratorally (eg. intranasally or orally via aerosol), intratracheally, nasopharyngeally, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intracranially, intradermally, intramuscularly, intraoccularly, intrathecally, intracereberally, intranasally, infusion, orally, rectally, via IV drip patch, implant and sublingual. Preferably, said route of administration is subcutaneously, intradermally or intranasally. Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to the compositions, as hereinbefore defined, when used in the method of the present invention. In yet another aspect, the present invention should be understood to extend to the use of the epitopes and peptides of the present invention in diagnostic applications. Said diagnostic applications include, but are not limited to: (i) To measure the reactivity of a subject's cells to Ara h 1. This is of use, for example, with respect to the diagnosis and/or monitoring of conditions characterised by an aberrant, unwanted or otherwise inappropriate immune response to Ara h 1. The peptides may be added into solution or bound to a solid support together with cells derived from peripheral blood or from tissue biopsies either unfractionated, fractionated or derived as a continuous cell line, Reactivity to the subject peptide may then be measured by standard proliferation assays such as incorporation of 1H3-thymidine, measurement of expressed or secreted molecules such as surface markers, cytokines or other standard assays of cellular activity which are well known in the art.(ii) The use of T cell epitope comprising peptides together with a T cell proliferation assay which utilises a T cell sample derived from the subject will facilitate, for example, the identification of a T cell responsive population. Methods of detecting Ara h 1 may be utilised, for example, to qualitatively or quantitatively detect Ara h 1 levels. However, these methods may also be utilised to screen for mutations or polymorphisms in Ara h 1 which mutations may result in, for example, loss of T cell reactivity to Ara h 1. These methods may be utilised for the purpose of screening for peptide molecules suitable for use in therapeutically or prophylactically treating an individual suffering from Ara h 1 related hypersensitivity. Accordingly, yet another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of diagnosing or monitoring a condition in a mammal, which condition is characterised by an aberrant, unwanted or inappropriate response to Ara h 1, said method comprising screening for Ara h 1 reactive T cells utilising the peptides or epitopes hereinbefore defined. Preferably said condition is hypersensitivity to peanuts or tree nuts which contain Ara h 1 or Ara h 1-like molecules, such as hazelnuts, almonds or Brazil nuts. In another embodiment the present invention provides diagnostic kits for use in the diagnostic methodology hereinbefore defined. The present invention will now be further described with reference to the following non-limiting Examples. Examples Methods Subjects Peanut-allergic adult subjects were recruited from The Alfred Allergy Clinic, Melbourne, Australia (Table 4). All subjects had clinical symptoms of IgE-mediated peanut allergy and peanut-specific IgE CAP score >1 (>0.49 kUA/l; Pharmacia CAP Systemâ¢, Pharmacia. Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden). Subjects used for T-cell line (TCL) generation were genotyped (HLA-DRB 1, -DQB 1 and -DPB 1, exon 2) by the Victorian Transplantation and Immunogenetics Service (Table 5). The study was approved by The Alfred and Monash University Ethics Committees and informed written consent obtained from each subject. Antigens Crude peanut extract (CPE) was prepared from commercial unsalted, dry-roasted peanuts as described (Prickett et al. 2011 supra; de Leon et al. Clin Exp Allergy. 2003; 33(9):1273-80). Ara h 1 and Ara h 1 were enriched from CPE by liquid chromatography as described (Prickett et al. 2011 supra). Endotoxin contents were 1.7, 4.0 and 78.0 EU/mg for CPE, Ara h 1 and Ara h 1 respectively (Endpoint Chromogenic LAL assay, Lonza, Walkersville, USA). Ara h 1 peptides (Mimotopes, Victoria, Australia and GenScript USA Inc, New Jersey, USA; Table 6) were reconstituted at 2 mg/ml in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide/PBS (20-mers and truncated peptide sets) or PBS alone (custom-synthesized core epitope peptides). All antigens were confirmed to be neither mitogenic nor toxic as described (Eusebius et al. Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2002; 127(3):234-44). Generation of Ara h 1-Specific CD4+ T-Cell Lines (TCL) Ara h 1-specific oligoclonal TCL were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of peanut-allergic subjects using 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidylester (CFSE)-based methodology (Mannering et al. J Immunol Methods. 2005; 298(1-2):83-92) as described (Prickett et al. 2011 supra), with CPE (100 pg/mL), Ara h 1 (10 gg/mL) or 20-mer peptides spanning the Ara h 1 sequence (11 amino acid (aa) overlap (17 aa overlap for the last peptide); Table 6; 10 pg/mL/peptide) as the driving antigens. All TCL were tested for specificity (proliferation) to individual Ara h 1 20-mers (10 pg/mL) as well as CPE (100 pg/mL) and/or Ara h 1 (10 pg/mL) Core epitope sequences were mapped within selected 20-mers using peptide sets truncated from the N- or C-terminus of the 20-mer as described (Prickett et al. 2011 supra). T-Cell Assays All culturing was performed in RPMI-1640 containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin and 5% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) (cRPMI). Antigen-induced TCL proliferation was assessed by 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake assays as described (Prickett et al. 2011 supra). A stimulation index (SI; cpm antigen-stimulated T cells/cpm unstimulated T cells) >2.5 was considered positive and all positive responses confirmed in >2 assays. HLA-restriction of epitope recognition by TCL was assessed using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against HILA-DR (L243), HLA-DQ (SVP-L3) or HLA-DP (B7/21) to block epitope presentation as described (Prickett et al. 2011 supra). To allow detection of peptide-induced CD4+ T-cell proliferation within whole PBMC, 7-day cultures of CFSE-labelled PBMC were set up as described for TCL generation (Prickett et al. 2011 supra). At least 10,000 CD4+ T cells were analyzed per sample and SI calculated as percentage of CD4+CFSElo (proliferated) cells with antigen/percentage of CD4+CFSElo cells without antigen (background). The detection threshold for a specific response in this assay was assessed by expanding peptide-specific TCL from proliferated CD4+ cells over a range of SI values for three subjects. Specific TCL could be generated from divided T cells with SI as low as 1.1 in all three subjects (data not shown) allowing designation of an SI>1.1 as positive. Basophil Activation Test Basophil activation was assessed by CD63 upregulation detected by flow cytometry as described (Drew et al. J Immunnol. 2004; 173(9):5872-9). Positive controls were rabbit anti-human IgE antibody (7.5 ug/mL; DAKO Corporation, CA, USA), N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP) (0.4 ug/mL; Sigma) and CPE. CPE, Ara h 1 and peptides were tested over a 3-log concentration range (5, 0.5 and 0.05 ug/mL) Results Selection of Ara h 1 20-Mer Peptides Containing Dominant CD4+ T-Cell Epitopes Recognized by Peanut-Allergic Subjects A total of 145 Ara h 1-specific T-cell lines (TCL) were generated from PBMC of 18 HLA-diverse peanut-allergic subjects (Table 4 and 5) by isolating and expanding antigen-specific (proliferated) CD4+CFSElo T cells from 7-day CFSE-labelled PBMC cultures stimulated with CPE, Ara h 1 or pools of Ara h 1 20-mer peptides collectively spanning the Ara h 1 sequence (Table 6). The 20-mer peptide(s) recognized (SI>2.5) by each subject are shown in Table 7 and data summarized in FIG. 1. For some subjects, CPE or Ara h 1 stimulation generated most TCL whilst for others it was the peptide pools. Where TCL were generated from a given subject using different antigen preparations (CPE, Ara h or peptide pools), TCL 20-mer specificities were comparable. Overall, there was no bias in the TCL 20-mer specificity generated depending on antigen preparation. The 145 TCL collectively recognized epitopes throughout the entire Ara h 1 sequence, with only four of the sixty-nine 20-mers failing to stimulate any TCL. Fourteen 20-mers (23, 24, 26, 38, 40, 44-51 and 57) were each recognized by four (22%) or more subjects, with peptides 50 and 51 having the most responders (six subjects; 33%) (FIG. 1). In order to select 20-mers containing dominant T-cell epitopes, a number of factors were considered in addition to responder frequencies, including magnitude of TCL response, number of specific TCL per subject, reproducibility of specific TCL response and ability to target specific T cells in PBMC. Based on these parameters, nine of the fourteen 20-mers (peptides 23, 24, 40, 46, 47, 49, 50, 51 and 57) were selected for subsequent analyses. These nine 20-mers were collectively recognized by 16 of the 18 subjects (89%) in this cohort, and typically induced strong and consistent proliferative responses in specific TCL, with the majority of SI over five and many considerably higher (Table 7). Furthermore, each of these 20-mers was recognized by multiple TCL from many responders reflecting a prevalence of T cells specific for these peptides among the subjects' T-cell repertoires. To assess recognition in a wider cohort, PBMC from an additional 21 peanut-allergic subjects were screened by CFSE assay for CD4+ T-cell proliferation in whole PBMC following seven days stimulation with each peptide (Table 1, upper panel and FIG. 4). This assay provided a sensitive and accurate screen for detecting peptide-specific CD4+ T cell responses within whole PBMC. All 21 subjects showed PBMC T-cell proliferation to CPE or a combination of enriched Ara h 1 and Ara h 1. The 20-mers were collectively recognized by 19 (90 of these subjects, with 8-12 (38-60%) responders per 20-mer. Analysis of four subjects from the original cohort used for TCL generation confirmed they also had T cells specific for other 20-mers in addition to those recognized by their TCL (Table 1, lower panel). Overall, T-cell recognition of the selected panel of nine 20-mers was confirmed in 35 (90%) of 39 subjects analyzed. Mapping Core T-Cell Epitopes within Selected Ara h 1 20-Mer Peptides Minimal length peptides decrease risk of cross-linking cell-bound IgE on inflammatory cells during clinical administration and facilitate therapeutic production. The minimum T-cell stimulatory sequence (core epitope) within each selected 20-mer was determined by testing proliferation of reactive TCL from different subjects to truncated peptide sets (e.g. FIG. 2 and Table 2). The number of residues required to induce maximal T-cell proliferation varied from 6-19 as between different TCL and/or subjects (Table 2), consistent with previous reports for CD4+ T-cell epitopes (Hemmer et al. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12(3):375-83 (Hemmer et al. a Immunol. 2000; 12(3):375-83; Suri et al. Curr Opin Immunol. 2006; 18(1):70-7). Due to variation in the number of flanking-residues required for optimal epitope recognition (Suri et al. 2006 supra), TCL were considered to recognize the same epitope if peptides containing a common core sequence induced recognition. Based on this criterion, ten distinct CD4+ T-cell epitopes were identified (âconsolidated epitopesâ, Table 2); with common cores varying from 5-12 as (underlined sequences, Table 2). âConsolidated epitopeâ sequences were selected to encompass residues required for maximal stimulation of all specific TCL tested to ensure broadest possible recognition. At least one epitope was found within each of the nine 20-mers, with 20-mers 50 and 51 each containing two distinct but overlapping T-cell epitopes: one unique to each 20-mer ((442-458) and (452-470)), and the other within the overlap sequence ((451-461), Table 2 and FIG. 2). No single TCL responded to both epitopes within either 20-mer, further confirming the distinction of these epitopes (data not shown). HLA-epitope prediction algorithms (Singh et al. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17(12):1236-7; Vita et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38(Database issue):D854-62) also highlighted one or more strong HLA class II (HLA-II) binding motifs within each of our minimal-stimulatory sequences. Data are shown for the Propred (Singh et al. 2001 supra) HLA-DR binding algorithm in Table 8. This algorithm did not predict HLA-DR epitopes within peptide 40, but algorithms of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and Analysis Resource (Vita et al. 2010, supra) predicted epitopes within this peptide to bind most strongly to HLA-DP and/or -DQ molecules. Finally, to avoid unnecessary sequence duplication and to minimize peptide numbers for a therapeutic, six of the consolidated epitopes (comprising three overlapping epitope pairs) were combined into three single peptides of 20 aa or less ((206-225), (409-427) and (451-470); grey shading, Table 2). The combined epitope peptides efficiently stimulated TCL specific for either epitope (data not shown) and together with the remaining four consolidated epitopes ((353-371), (436-452), (442-458) and (507-524)), provided a panel of seven candidate peptides for further characterization (see asterisks, Table II). CFSE-based screening of nine subjects from our cohorts confirmed that these peptides could each directly target detectable numbers of Ara h 1-specific T cells among whole PBMC of peanut-allergic subjects (Table 9). Determining HLA Class II Restriction Specificity of Ara h 1 T-Cell Epitopes There is no identified HLA-II association with peanut allergy (Shreffler et al. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2006; 96(6):865-9), therefore peptides selected for therapy must bind diverse HILA-II molecules for wide applicability. To determine the HLA-II type presenting each epitope, anti-HLA-DR, -DP or -DQ mAbs were used to block individual epitope presentation to T cells. For each TCL tested, epitope recognition was prevented by one or more HLA-mAb in a dose-dependent manner (e.g. FIG. 5) and the same mAb blocked recognition of CPE (data not shown), demonstrating consistency for presentation of naturally processed and synthetic epitope forms. At least two subjects and/or TCL were tested per epitope (Table 3). Consistent with predictions of the HLA-II algorithms described above (Singh et al. 2001 supra; Vita et al. 2010 supra), anti-HLA-DR blocked recognition of all but one epitope, (353-371), which was blocked by anti-HLA-DQ in both subjects tested. For epitopes (436-452) and (507-524), recognition was blocked by anti-HLA-DR for some TCL but by anti-HLA-DQ for others, confirming HLA-binding degeneracy for these epitopes. To assess HLA-binding degeneracy of epitopes whose recognition was blocked by a single HLA-mAb, the respective HILA-alleles of at least two subjects with TCL specific for that epitope were compared (Table 5 and Table 3). The absence of shared HLA-DRB1 or HLA-DQB1 alleles between subjects recognizing HLA-DR- or HLA-DQ-restricted epitopes respectively confirmed that each epitope was presented on at least two different HLA-molecules. The HLA-binding algorithms further supported these data, with each epitope containing motifs predicted to bind multiple HLA-molecules ((Singh et al. 2001 supra; Vita et al. 2010 supra) (e.g. Table 8). Testing Candidate Peptides for Basophil Activation To provide a safe alternative to whole allergens, peptides must not bind and cross-link cell-bound IgE. Basophil reactivity to peptides was assessed in fresh blood from seven of the peanut-allergic subjects recruited for this study (Table 4) (FIG. 3). All seven subjects showed high levels of basophil activation to CPE over a concentration range. Whilst responses to Ara h 1 varied between subjects at the lowest dose, the highest concentration induced high activation in all subjects. However, none of the candidate peptides induced activation at any concentration tested. One subject showed a very low response (8%) to peptide (409-427), but this was below the threshold of positive activation (Boumiza et al. Clin Mol Allergy. 2005; 3:9) and was negligible compared to the activation induced by Ara h 1 (80-90%) or CPE (74-76%) in this subject.
