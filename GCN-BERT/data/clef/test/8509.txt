WATER-BASED COMPOSITIONS THAT RESIST DIRT PICK-UP RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61/799,995, filed March 15, 2013 and 61/836,884, filed June 19, 2013, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND Water-based compositions, e.g., coating compositions such as paints, that include latex polymer particles or water-dispersible polymer particles typically also include a coalescent (i.e., coalescing agent or film-forming agent) in addition to pigments and fillers, for example. The coalescent functions as a solvent as well as a plasticizer for the polymer particles (to soften the polymer particles and assist in the formation of a continuous coating or film, for example, after applying it to a surface and allowing it to dry). Useful coalescents are generally stable in the presence of water, compatible with other ingredients typically used in paint formulations, particularly the polymer particles, such that the stability of the water-based composition is not compromised. They are also typically sufficiently volatile to escape when the applied composition is allowed to dry, but sufficiently nonvolatile to evaporate more slowly than other ingredients that delay film formation (e.g., drying retarders, antifreezes). However, there is a general desire in the industry to reduce volatile organic emissions, thereby reducing the environmental and health concerns. Although new and improved coalescents have been developed that provide low VOC compositions, such compositions can still be relatively soft and tacky. From the moment it is applied, a low VOC composition, such as a paint, seal coat, caulk, etc. is exposed to contamination from the atmosphere. This contamination includes dirt and dust that are carried to the surface by rain, airborne moisture droplets, wind currents or direct physical contact with people, animals or other objects. Dirt can be either organic or inorganic. Examples of dirt particles include sand, smoke particles, dust, metallic fibres, carbon black, rust, grease, pollen, human detritus, and fungal spores. Dirt particles attract moisture to the surface of the composition. This moisture provides a suitable environment in which microbial spores may survive and proliferate into colonies, thus further contributing to the unsightly appearance of the surface. Accordingly, water-based compositions can acquire a dirty and unsightly appearance because of the amount of air-bome dirt that clings to them. An effective dirt pick-up resistance technology which is suitable for low VOC compositions, and which does not compromise the required application and performance properties of surface finishes, is a common goal of the paint industry. SUMMARY The present disclosure provides water-based compositions, such as coating compositions, containing a low VOC coalescent, a latex polymer or water-dispersible polymer, and a water-insoluble UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorber, and methods of making such compositions. In one method of the present disclosure, a method of preparing a water-based composition is provided wherein the method includes: providing an aqueous polymer including a latex or water-dispersible polymer in water; providing an additive package including at least one of a pigment, a thickener, a mildewcide, a biocide, a defoamer, a surfactant, a dispersant, a filler, and combinations thereof; providing one or more water-insoluble UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers capable of absorbing radiation within a range of 240-465 (preferably, 240-400) nm; providing one or more low VOC coalescents having a volatile organic content of 30% or less, or that elute from a GC column at the same time or after methyl palmitate under the same conditions; mixing (preferably, dissolving) the one or more water-insoluble UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers in the one or more low VOC coalescents to form an absorber-coalescent mixture (preferably, solution); and combining the aqueous polymer, the additive package, and the absorber-coalescent to form a water-based coating. In another embodiment, a method of preparing a water-based composition is provided that includes: providing an aqueous polymer including a latex polymer in water; providing an additive package including at least one of a pigment, a thickener, a mildewcide, a biocide, a defoamer, a surfactant, a dispersant, a fdler, and combinations thereof; providing one or more water-insoluble UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers capable of absorbing radiation within a range of 240-465 (preferably, 240-400) nm; providing one or more low VOC coalescents having a volatile organic content of 30% or less, or that elute from a GC column at the same time or after methyl palmitate under the same conditions; dissolving the one or more water-insoluble UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers in the one or more low VOC coalescents to form an absorber-coalescent solution; mixing the absorber-coalescent solution with the aqueous polymer; and subsequently mixing the aqueous polymer, having the absorber-coalescent therein, with the additive package. The present disclosure also provides a water-based composition prepared by a method as described herein. DEFINITIONS The term “latex” means a dispersion of polymer particles in water; a latex polymer typically requires a secondary dispersing agent (e.g., a surfactant) for creating a dispersion or emulsion of polymer particles in water having at least a one-month shelf stability at normal storage temperatures. The term “water-dispersible” in the context of the polymer means one that is itself capable of being dispersed into water for creating a dispersion or emulsion of polymer particles in water having at least a one-month shelf stability at normal storage temperatures. The term “dispersible” in the context of a dispersible coalescent means that the coalescent can be mixed into the water-based composition of latex or water-dispersible polymer particles to form a uniform mixture without the use of high shear mixing. The term “stable” in the context of a water-based composition containing a dispersible coalescent means that the coalescent does not phase separate from the water-based composition upon standing at 120°F (49°C) for at least four weeks. The terms “volatile organic content” and “VOC” in the context of the coalescent herein mean the volatility of the coalescent as measured by ASTM D23 69-90 or ASTM D6886-12. ASTM D2369-90 involves weighing out approximately 0.5 gram (g) of coalescent into an aluminum weighing dish and placing it in a forced air oven at 110°C for 1 hour. The dish is then reweighed and the mass lost represents the percent (%) VOC of the coalescent. Alternatively, ASTM D6886-12 involves a gas chromatography method and the relative elution from a gas chromatography column relative to methyl palmitate. For the purposes of this application, any compound that elutes after methyl palmitate following ASTM D6886-12 is not considered a VOC. The terms “volatile organic content” and “VOC” in the context of the composition mean the volatility of the composition as measured by ASTM D3960-02 or ASTM D6886-12. According to ASTM D3960-02, this involves using the following calculation: [(weight percent of total volatiles less water less exempt volatile compounds)*(density of paint)/ 100%-(volume percent of water)]-(volume percent of exempt volatile compounds). In this context, “exempt” from VOC include compounds such as acetone and t-butyl acetate. According to ASTM D6886-12, this involves quantifying each component that elutes before methyl palmitate and adding up the total amount of each such component to get the total VOC of the composition. The term “organic group” means a hydrocarbon (i.e., hydrocarbyl) group with optional elements other than carbon and hydrogen in the chain, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and silicon that is classified as an aliphatic group, cyclic group, or combination of aliphatic and cyclic groups (e.g., alkaryl and aralkyl groups). The term “aliphatic group” means a saturated or unsaturated linear or branched hydrocarbon group. This term is used to encompass alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups, for example. The term “alkyl group” means a saturated linear or branched hydrocarbon group including, for example, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, heptyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, amyl, 2-ethylhexyl, and the like. The term “alkenyl group” means an unsaturated linear or branched hydrocarbon group with one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, such as a vinyl group. The term “alkynyl group” means an unsaturated linear or branched hydrocarbon group with one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds. The term “cyclic group” means a closed ring hydrocarbon group that is classified as an alicyclic group, aromatic group, or heterocyclic group. The term “alicyclic group” means a cyclic hydrocarbon group having properties resembling those of aliphatic groups. The term “aromatic group” or “aryl group” means a mono- or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon group. The term “heterocyclic group” means a closed ring hydrocarbon in which one or more of the atoms in the ring is an element other than carbon (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc.). Substitution is anticipated on the organic groups of the coalescents used in the compositions of the present disclosure. As a means of simplifying the discussion and recitation of certain terminology used throughout this application, the terms “group” and “moiety” are used to differentiate between chemical species that allow for substitution or that may be substituted and those that do not allow or may not be so substituted. Thus, when the term “group” is used to describe a chemical substituent, the described chemical material includes the unsubstituted group and that group with O, Ν, Si, or S atoms, for example, in the chain (as in an alkoxy group) as well as carbonyl groups or other conventional substitution. Where the term “moiety” is used to describe a chemical compound or substituent, only an unsubstituted chemical material is intended to be included. For example, the phrase “alkyl group” is intended to include not only pure open chain saturated hydrocarbon alkyl substituents, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, t-butyl, and the like, but also alkyl substituents bearing further substituents known in the art, such as hydroxy, alkoxy, alkylsulfonyl, halogen atoms, cyano, nitro, amino, carboxyl, etc. Thus, “alkyl group” includes ether groups, haloalkyls, nitroalkyls, carboxyalkyls, hydroxyalkyls, sulfoalkyls, etc. On the other hand, the phrase “alkyl moiety” is limited to the inclusion of only pure open chain saturated hydrocarbon alkyl substituents, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, t-butyl, and the like. The term “hydrocarbyl moiety” refers to unsubstituted organic moieties containing only hydrogen and carbon. The terms “comprises” and variations thereof do not have a limiting meaning where these terms appear in the description and claims. Such terms will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated step or element or group of steps or elements but not the exclusion of any other step or element or group of steps or elements. By “consisting of’ is meant including, and limited to, whatever follows the phrase “consisting of.” Thus, the phrase “consisting of’ indicates that the listed elements are required or mandatory, and that no other elements may be present. By “consisting essentially of’ is meant including any elements listed after the phrase, and limited to other elements that do not interfere with or contribute to the activity or action specified in the disclosure for the listed elements. Thus, the phrase “consisting essentially of’ indicates that the listed elements are required or mandatory, but that other elements are optional and may or may not be present depending upon whether or not they materially affect the activity or action of the listed elements. The words “preferred” and “preferably” refer to embodiments of the disclosure that may afford certain benefits, under certain circumstances. However, other embodiments may also be preferred, under the same or other circumstances. Furthermore, the recitation of one or more preferred embodiments does not imply that other embodiments are not useful, and is not intended to exclude other embodiments from the scope of the disclosure. As used herein, “a,” “an,” “the,” “at least one,” and “one or more” are used interchangeably. Thus, for example, a composition that comprises “a” coalescent can be interpreted to mean that the composition includes “one or more” coalescents. As used herein, the term “or” is generally employed in its usual sense including “and/or” unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. The term “and/or” means one or all of the listed elements or a combination of any two or more of the listed elements. Also herein, all numbers are assumed to be modified by the term “about” and preferably by the term “exactly.” As used herein in connection with a measured quantity, the term “about” refers to that variation in the measured quantity as would be expected by the skilled artisan making the measurement and exercising a level of care commensurate with the objective of the measurement and the precision of the measuring equipment used. Also herein, the recitations of numerical ranges by endpoints include all numbers subsumed within that range as well as the endpoints (e.g., 1 to 5 includes 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4, 5, etc.). Herein, the statement “up to” a number (e.g., “up to 50”) includes that number (e.g., 50). The above summary of the present disclosure is not intended to describe each disclosed embodiment or every implementation of the present disclosure. The description that follows more particularly exemplifies illustrative embodiments. In several places throughout the application, guidance is provided through lists of examples, which examples can be used in various combinations. In each instance, the recited list serves only as a representative group and should not be interpreted as an exclusive list. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The present disclosure provides water-based compositions, such as coating compositions, particularly paints, containing a low VOC coalescent, a latex or a water-dispersible polymer, and a water-insoluble UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorber. Preferably, the water-based compositions are in the form of paints, although sealers, caulks, and sealants are within the scope of the present disclosure. The water-based compositions of the present disclosure are advantageous in that they have a relatively low volatile organic content without sacrificing the balance of properties desired for an applied (i.e., dry) composition, such as a coating of paint. Governments have established regulations setting forth guidelines relating to volatile organic compounds (VOC) that may be released into the atmosphere. Such regulations vary from region to region, but the most stringent regulations are in the south coast region (e.g., Los Angeles County and Orange County, CA). Such regulations also vary by product. For example, clear topcoats can have no more than 200 grams per liter (g/1), water-borne coatings can have no more than 50 g/1, pigmented lacquers can have no more than 275 g/1 VOC. Reducing the volatility of coalescents, solvents, plasticizers, etc. can adversely affect the balance of properties needed in water-based compositions, especially with respect to dirt pick-up. Thus, there is a need for compositions that possess desirable stability, compatibility, fdm formation ability, low dirt pick-up, etc. Compositions of the present disclosure possess these properties while possessing low total VOC in the water-based compositions. In certain embodiments, the water-based compositions include no greater than 25 grams per 100 grams polymer solids, or no greater than 20 grams per 100 grams polymer solids, or no greater than 15 grams per 100 grams polymer solids, or no greater than 10 grams per 100 grams polymer solids, or no greater than 5 grams per 100 grams polymer solids, or no greater than 2 grams per 100 grams polymer solids. Stated another way, in certain embodiments wherein the water-based compositions of the present disclosure are paints, they include no greater than 25 grams per liter of paint, or no greater than 20 grams per liter of paint, or no greater than 15 grams per liter of paint, or no greater than 10 grams per liter of paint. UV-VIS Absorbers (Photoinitiators) Compounds that are suitable for use in the present disclosure as UV-VIS absorbers include ultraviolet absorbers, visible light absorbers, or combinations thereof. These are typically referred to as photoinitiators. Suitable UV-VIS absorbers are water-insoluble. By this it is meant that the compounds will not dissolve to an appreciable extent (i.e., will not dissolve in an amount of more than 5 wt-%) in water at the temperatures typically used for preparing water-based compositions as described herein. In certain embodiments, suitable UV-VIS absorbers are those compounds capable of absorbing ultraviolet and/or visible radiation within a range of 240-465 nm. For certain embodiments, they are capable of absorbing radiation in the 280-450 nm range. In certain embodiments, suitable visible light absorbers are those compounds capable of absorbing visible radiation within a range of 420-450 nm. In certain embodiments, suitable ultraviolet absorbers are those compounds capable of absorbing UV radiation within a range of 240-400 nm. For certain embodiments, they are capable of absorbing UV radiation in the 280-400 nm range, and for certain embodiments in the 315-375 nm range. Herein, the UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers do not form a bond to the polymer, although they are capable of generating a radical through a hydrogen-abstraction mechanism by absorbing UV-VIS (typically, UV) radiation. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it may be that this results in surface crosslinking of the polymer. Examples of suitable ultraviolet absorbers include the following: Benzophenone, available from Lamberti, Gallaratte, Italy; Phenylbis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide, available under the trade name IRGACURE 819DW from BASF, Florham Park, NJ; Ethyl- 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphenylphosphinate, available under the trade name LUCIRIN TPO-L (formerly: LUCIRIN LR 8893) from BASF, Florham Park, NJ; 2,4,6-trimethylbenzophenone & 4-methylbenzophenone, available as a mixture under the trade name ESACURE ΤΖΤ from Lamberti, Gallaratte, Italy; 2,2-Dimethoxy-l,2-diphenylethanone (i.e., Benzildimethylketal), available under the trade name ESACURE KB 1 from Lamberti; 1-Hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (i.e., a-hydroxycyclohexylphenylketone), available under the trade name ESACURE KS 300 from Lamberti; 2-Hydroxy-2-methyl-l -phenyl- 1-propanone, available under the trade name ESACURE KL 200 from Lamberti; Polymeric Benzophenone, available under the trade name EBECRYL Ρ39 from Cytec, Woodland Park, NJ; Isopropylthioxanthone, available under the trade name GENOCURE ITX from Rahn USA, Aurora, IL; Methyl-o-benzoyl-benzoate, available under the trade name GENOCURE ΜΒΒ from Rahn; Methylbenzoylformate, available under the trade name GENOCURE MBF from Rahn; Benzoin ethyl ether, available from Aldrich. St. Louis, MO; 4'-Ethoxyacetophenone, from Aldrich. St. Louis, MO; and combinations thereof. Other suitable UV-VIS absorbers are available commercially from BASF under the trade designations IRGACURE and LUCERIN. The amount of the UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers present in the water-based compositions of the present disclosure includes an amount that provides the desired result. In certain embodiments, the water-based composition of the present disclosure includes a sufficient amount of the one or more water-insoluble UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers to improve dirt pick-up resistance by at least 10%, or at least 20%, or at least 30%, or at least 40%, or at least 50%, relative to the same water-based composition without the UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorber, based on a change in ΛΕ values. A coating discolors when it picks up dirt. ΛΕ is measured by a spectrophotometer by comparing the paint that is exposed to dirt and the paint that is “clean” of dirt. The difference is expressed as AE. ΛΕ can be measured using a suitable spectrophotometer (e.g., Datacolor Check II Spectrophotometer using CIELab software) following ASTM D2244, Standard Test Method for Calculation of Color Differences From Instrumentally Measured Color Coordinates. The difference in AE’s from the “control” paint and the “experimental” paint can then be calculated. The improvement in dirt pick-up resistance can be expressed as a percentage by taking the difference in ΛΕ divided by the ΛΕ of the “control” paint. In certain embodiments, the water-based compositions of the present disclosure include at least 0.1 wt-%, or at least 0.3 wt-%, or at least 0.5 wt-%, of one or more UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers, based on the weight of the polymer solids. In certain embodiments, the water-based compositions of the present disclosure include up to 5.0 wt-%, or up to 3.0 wt-%, or up to 1.5 wt-%, or up to 1.0 wt-%, of one or more UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers, based on the weight of the polymer solids. Coalescents Suitable coalescents for use in water-based compositions of the present disclosure are those compounds that assist in coalescing latex or water-dispersible particles. That is, compounds that are good coalescents advantageously provide good fdm forming properties for the latex or water-dispersible polymer particles. Preferably, the coating compositions include one or more coalescent compounds having a relatively low volatile organic content (VOC), and more preferably, a relatively low molecular weight. Typically, the volatile organic content of suitable coalescents, as determined by ASTM D2369-90, is 30% or less, 20% or less, 15% or less, 11% or less, or 10% or less, based on the original weight of the coalescent. Alternatively stated, suitable low volatile organic content coalescents can be identified by ASTM D6886-12 in terms of their elution from a gas chromatography column relative to methyl palmitate. Those coalescents that elute before methyl palmitate are too volatile to be useful in the water-based compositions of the present disclosure. Those coalescents that elute at the same time as or after methyl palmitate are sufficiently low VOC coalescents for use in the water-based coating compositions of the present disclosure. Typically, using the standard chromatography conditions specified in ASTM D6886-12 compounds that elute at 18.4 minutes or more are acceptable. Those that elute at 20 minutes or more are more acceptable, and those that elute at 22 minutes or more are even more acceptable. Typically, suitable compounds elute at up to 30 minutes, or up to 28 minutes, or up to 26 minutes. Preferably, the number average molecular weights of such compounds are 750 or less, and more preferably, 500 or less. In certain embodiments, suitable low VOC coalescents assist in the formation of a continuous coating or film from the latex or water-dispersible particles after applying a coating composition containing such particles (e.g., a paint) to a surface and allowing it to dry (preferably, in certain embodiments, drying occurs while not reacting with the polymer particles) at room temperature for at least 7 days. In certain embodiments, a particularly desirable group of low VOC coalescents are those that provide good film forming properties at low temperatures (e.g., below room temperature). Preferably, such compounds facilitate the formation of polymer films of the polymer particles at a temperature of less than 25°C (more preferably, at a temperature of 4°C to 10°C, and most preferably, at a temperature of 4°C to 5°C). Suitable coalescents are dispersible in the water-based compositions, which are preferably stable over time. By this it is meant, the coalescent does not phase separate from the water-based composition upon standing at 49°C for four weeks. In certain embodiments, suitable low VOC coalescents are compatible with the polymer and other components in the system. That is, they are nonreactive in the composition. In certain embodiments, they are not crosslinkers of the polymer or otherwise reactive with the polymer. In certain embodiments, suitable low VOC coalescents are not polymerizable monomers, such as acrylates and methacrylates. The low VOC coalescents can optionally also function as plasticizers and/or solvents. In particular, suitable low VOC coalescents are those that can function as solvents for the UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorber in the coalescent is at least 5 percent by weight (wt-%), or at least 10 wt-%, or at least 20 wt-%, or at least 25 wt-%, based on total weight of the mixture (preferably, solution). In certain embodiments, the concentration of the UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorber in the coalescent is up to 30 wt-%, or up to 40 wt-%, or up to 50 wt-%, based on the total weight of the mixture (preferably, solution). In certain embodiments, the absorber-coalescent mixtures (preferably, solutions) include 25-30 wt-% of one or more UV-VIS (preferably, ultraviolet) absorbers. Typically, an amount of less than 5 wt-% does not deliver enough absorber to the final water-based composition for effective improvement in dirt pick-up resistance. In certain embodiments, such low VOC coalescents are of the formula: R1 -(C(0)-Xr-0)n-R2 wherein: η is 1 to 10; R1 is an organic group, preferably, having less than 100 carbon atoms, and more preferably, having 3 to 24 carbon atoms; R2 is hydrogen or an organic group, preferably, having less than 100 carbon atoms; and X is a divalent organic group, preferably, having 2 to 8 carbon atoms, and more preferably, 3 to 5 carbon atoms; and r is 0 to 1.

In this preferred formulation for R1, m + pq is preferably less than 23. Preferably, X is a divalent hydrocarbyl moiety, although for certain preferred embodiments, X is an organic group that includes substituents selected from the group of nonperoxidic oxygen atoms, carbonyl groups, and combinations thereof, and more preferably, nonperoxidic oxygen atoms and carbonyl groups. For certain embodiments, X has the formula -(CH2)S- wherein s is 2 to 8, and preferably, s is 3 to 5. For certain embodiments, X includes unsaturation. Preferably, X includes at least one carbon-carbon double bond. A preferred example of such a compound is bis(2-ethylhexyl)maleate (i.e., dioctyl maleate), which is available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI. Preferably, R2 is hydrogen, although for certain preferred embodiments R2 is R1 as defined above. For certain embodiments, r is one, preferably when R2 is hydrogen. For certain embodiments, R1 includes at least three carbon atoms when X is not -(CH2)s- wherein s is 2 to 8; and R1 and R2 together include less than two aliphatic unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds when r is zero, preferably, R1 and R2 together do not include any aliphatic unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds when r is zero, and more preferably, R1 and R2 together do not include any aliphatic unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds.

Each paint sample was dried for 24 hours at room temperature (70-75°F, approximately 20-24°C). Then, each panel was placed outdoors or in a QUVA cabinet for 1 week, with some exposure to sunlight. The panels were returned to the lab after 1 week exposure and blotted dry if necessary. A “dirt” slurry was prepared as follows. First, 50 grams (g) red iron oxide (R4097), 40 g yellow iron oxide pigment, and 10 g black iron oxide pigment were combined and hand stirred or shaken until homogenous. Then, 0.5 g TAMOL 731 (dispersant available from Dow Chemical) was added to 200 g deionized water with agitation. The pigment combination was slowly added and mixed for 30 minutes until a smooth slurry has formed. The slurry was applied to half of the coated panels using a foam applicator or other suitable brush, and dried on panels at room temperature for 3-4 hours. The dried slurry was washed off each panel by running the panel under water and using a small piece of cheesecloth, rubbing lightly. A clean cloth was used for each panel. The panels were blotted dry and allowed to completely dry (2-4 hours) before measuring change in color, AE, using a spectrophotometerAE was measured using a Datacolor Check II Spectrophotometer using CIELab software following ASTM D2244, Standard Test Method for Calculation of Color Differences From Instrumentally Measured Color Coordinates. Procedure 4: Dirt Pick-Up Testing The dirt pick-up resistance was evaluated using the Lab Dirt Pick-Up Test Procedure described above. Aluminum panels were prepared in duplicate and results are averaged. The results are reported as a change in color, ΛΕ, reading from a spectrophotometer, in Tables 4 and 5. Example 1. Paints Prepared using Semi Gloss Formulation and Method 1 A pigment grind was prepared by adding to a grind pot with Cowles dispersing blade, in order, the first 9 ingredients in the paint formula listed in Table 3. The mixture was dispersed at high speed for 20 minutes. In a second pot, the pigment grind was added to EPS 2792 polymer and the remaining ingredients were added, one at a time. After all other ingredients were added, Preparations Α-G (From Table 2) were added to the paint. These samples were tested using Procedures 3 and 4 and the results reported in Table 4. Table 4.
