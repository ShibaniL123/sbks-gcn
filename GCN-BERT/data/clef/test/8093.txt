RELATED APPLICATIONS The instant application claims priority benefit to co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/951,714 entitled “Polyurethane Adhesives for Reverse Osmosis Modules” filed on Mar. 12, 2014, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD The instant invention generally relates to polyurethane adhesives. More specifically, the instant invention relates to polyurethane adhesives used for fabricating reverse osmosis (RO) modules. BACKGROUND Reverse osmosis is the process of forcing a solvent from a region of high solute concentration through a semipermeable membrane to a region of low solute concentration. The process is done by applying a pressure in excess of the osmotic pressure. Reverse osmosis has numerous applications, including, but not limited to, the separation of pure water from seawater and brackish waters where seawater or brackish water is pressurized against one surface of the membrane, causing transport of salt-depleted water across the membrane and emergence of potable drinking water from the low-pressure side. Other applications of reverse osmosis include concentrating food liquids, e.g., orange juice, production of maple syrup, and production of hydrogen. There are typically two types of semipermeable membrane configurations used for reverse osmosis: spiral wound cartridges and hollow core. The membranes have a dense layer in the polymer matrix where the separation of solute from solvent occurs. In most cases, the membrane is designed to allow only solvent (such as water) to pass through this dense layer, while preventing the passage of solutes (such as salt ions). As discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,736, spiral wound cartridges include adhesives to seal the interstices or voids in the membrane, which prevents leakage of feed fluid to the permeate collection tube. In a particular example, as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,303,675, the adhesive can be applied to an upstream surface of a membrane material in locations where a downstream surface has been treated that flow therethrough is prevented. The adhesive can be applied in other locations of the membrane material as required by the structure and/or application the membrane is utilized in, such as, for example, folds of the membrane, along longitudinal edges, a downstream surface, and the like. Since the cartridge is subjected to high water pressure, the fully-cured adhesive must be strong and durable. If the hardness of the fully-cured adhesive is too low, then the pressure of the water can cause failure of the adhesive bond, and ultimately the failure of the cartridge. However, if the hardness of the fully-cured adhesive is too high then the adhesive can become brittle and also cause failure. The hardness of the adhesive can be measured on the Shore hardness scale, and the methods of taking such measurements are known in the art. Further, it is noted that the tensile strength of a fully-cured adhesive is used as a measure of suitability of the adhesive in a reverse osmosis module. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a further characteristic of a successful adhesive is the ability of the adhesive to penetrate the membrane material in order to establish a sufficient adhesive bond. As noted in U.S. Pat. No. 7,303,675, it has been found that over time, and through use of cleaning solutions, traditionally used adhesives may crack or blister (often referred to as “osmotic blistering”), which results in side seal leakage and end seal leakage (often referred to as “veining” or “lightning bolt” failure) of the feed fluid to the permeate collection tube. Osmotic blistering may also encourage bacterial growth and may also cause dimensional change of the membrane, making it difficult to remove and replace. Osmotic blistering is exacerbated by the use of alkaline cleaning fluids, such as, for example, sodium hydroxide solution, which are frequently used in the industry. Thus, there is a need for an improved adhesive composition that also has an increased or improved resistance to alkaline fluids while retaining the performance requirements noted above. The present invention is believed to be an answer to the need of providing an adhesive that is durable in reverse osmosis applications and is resistant to alkaline fluids. SUMMARY The adhesive composition of the present invention surprisingly reduces or eliminates osmotic blistering and veining and lightning bolt failures often exhibited in known adhesive compositions. The adhesive compositions of the present invention also minimizes the width of the bond line used in the reverse osmosis module application while demonstrating improved rheology, viscosity and flow control as compared to known adhesive compositions. In one aspect, the invention is directed to an adhesive composition suitable for reverse osmosis modules, the adhesive composition comprising: (I) from about 65 wt % to 99 wt % of a polyurethane composition based on a total wt % of the adhesive composition, the polyurethane composition comprising: (A) an isocyanate group-containing pre-polymer comprising a reaction product of (i) castor oil or a derivative thereof; and (ii) a polyisocyanate; and (iii) optionally a second polyol; and (B) an isocyanate-reactive polyol mixture comprising: (i) a polybutadiene polyol; and (ii) a urethane catalyst; and (iii) optionally the second polyol; and (II) from about 1 wt % to about 35 wt % of a plasticizer based on the total wt % of the adhesive composition, wherein the adhesive composition is essentially free from diluent oils and solvents. A further aspect of the invention is directed to an adhesive composition suitable for reverse osmosis modules, the adhesive composition comprising: (I) from about 65 wt % to about 99 wt % of a polyurethane composition, based on a total weight of the adhesive composition, the polyurethane composition comprising: (A) an isocyanate group-containing pre-polymer comprising a reaction product of (i) castor oil or a derivative thereof; and (ii) a polyisocyanate; and (B) an isocyanate-reactive polyol mixture comprising: (i) polybutadiene polyol; (ii) a urethane catalyst; and (iii) a secondary polyol; and (II) from about 1 wt % to about 35 wt % of a plasticizer, based on the total wt % of the adhesive composition, wherein the adhesive composition is essentially free from diluents oils and solvents, further wherein a tensile strength of the adhesive composition when fully cured is at least 1,000 psi, and a Shore hardness of the adhesive composition when fully cured is between about 35 D and about 75 D. A further aspect of the invention is directed to a reverse osmosis module comprising an adhesive composition according to any of the adhesive compositions described herein. Still a further aspect of the invention is directed to a method of constructing a reverse osmosis module, the method comprising: applying an adhesive composition to at least a portion of a membrane present in the reverse osmosis module, the adhesive composition according to any of the adhesive compositions described herein. These and other aspects are discussed in more detail herein. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a perspective drawing of a reverse osmosis module having a membrane with an adhesive composition applied thereto. DETAILED DESCRIPTION In general, the invention is directed to an adhesive composition that includes a polyurethane composition and a plasticizer. The adhesive composition is essentially free from diluent oils and solvents. The term “essentially free” as used herein means the composition contains unavoidable levels but no more. Diluent oils and solvents are not part of the adhesive composition and the term “diluent oils and solvents” refer to compositions that do not include the polyurethane adhesive, i.e., they are not reacted with the polyisocyanate in the adhesive composition, and include, but are not limited to hydrocarbons, e.g., petroleum spirits, kerosene, mineral oils and vegetable oils such as corn oil, canola oil, and olive oil. The adhesive composition can be used, for example, in a reverse osmosis module and the inventors have surprisingly found that adhesive compositions according to the embodiments herein reduces or eliminates osmotic blistering and leakage in reverse osmosis modules. The adhesive composition includes a two-part polyurethane composition (hereinafter referred to as a “polyurethane composition”) and a plasticizer. In one embodiment, the adhesive composition includes from about 65 wt. % to about 99 wt. % of the polyurethane composition (or any amount in between) and from about 1 wt. % to about 35 wt. % plasticizer (or any amount in between) based on the total wt. % of the adhesive composition. It is contemplated that other amounts of the polyurethane composition may be present in the adhesive composition, such as, for example, the polyurethane may be present in an amount between about 75 wt. % and 99 wt. % or any amount in between, based on the total weight of the adhesive composition. In another example, the polyurethane may be present in an amount between about 85 wt. % and 99 wt. % or any amount in between, based on the total weight of the adhesive composition. The plasticizer may be present in the adhesive composition in and amount between about 1 wt. % and 35 wt. % or any amount in between, based on the total weight of the adhesive composition. In one example, the plasticizer may be present in the adhesive composition in an amount between about 20 wt. % and about 30 wt. % or any amount in between, based on the total weight of the adhesive composition. The polyurethane composition used in the adhesive composition includes part (A), which is an isocyanate group-containing pre-polymer comprising a reaction product of castor oil or a derivative thereof and a polyisocyanate and optionally a second polyol; and part (B), which is an isocyanate-reactive polyol mixture comprising a polybutadiene polyol and a urethane catalyst and optionally the second polyol. Part (A) and part (B) of the polyurethane composition can be mixed together in any manner known in the art, including, but not limited to hand mixing, static mixing, and dynamic mixing.

The polyurethane composition and the plasticizer may be combined or mixed in any manner acceptable to form the adhesive composition, which includes, but is not limited to, hand mixing, static mixing, and dynamic mixing. It is noted that the polyurethane composition may be added to the plasticizer, or vice versa, or alternatively, the polyurethane composition and plasticizer may be simultaneously added to a vessel to form the adhesive composition. The adhesive composition may include a filler, or a rheology modifier preferably being a thixotropic agent (“thixotrope(s)”) or a combination thereof, which may be added to part (A) and/or part (B) of the polyurethane composition.

The rheology modifier includes all synthetic and natural anti-sagging additives from BYK Additives/Elements Specialties, Wallingford, Conn., USA, along with primary amine-terminated polyether compounds. Primary amine-terminated polyether compounds include, but are not limited to polyoxypropylene amine having a molecular weight from about 110 or 200, to preferably about 500 (although molecular weights up to about 2000 are suitable) and an amine functionality of about 2 to 3, preferably about 2. Such primary amino-terminated polyethers are manufactured and sold by Huntsman Corporation, Salt Lake City, Utah, under the name Jeffamine. Particularly preferred is Jeffamine D-230, which is a polyoxypropylene glycol terminated with primary amines and having an amine functionality of 2 and a molecular weight of about 230. Crosslinking in the adhesive composition can be further accelerated by adding a hydroxyl-containing tertiary amine such as diisoproponol amine commercially available as QUADROL by BASF Corp., Germany. Thixotropy develops rapidly when part (A) and part (B) of the polyurethane composition are mixed together in the presence of such amines. Thixotropic agents include, but are not limited to, inorganic additives and can include, for example, fumed silica, amorphous silicon dioxide, clays, bentonites, talcs, and the like, and combinations thereof. When the polyurethane composition and the plasticizer are combined to form the adhesive composition, the adhesive composition typically has an initial mix viscosity of at least about 10,000 cps. It is noted that the term “initial mix” as used in “initial mix viscosity” refers to the viscosity of the adhesive composition when both parts (A) and (B) of the polyurethane and the plasticizer are first mixed together. In another example, the initial mix viscosity of the adhesive composition is between about 10,000 cps and about 40,000 cps, including any value therebetween. In another example, the initial mix viscosity of the adhesive composition is between about 10,000 cps and about 25,000 cps, including any value therebetween. In a further example, the initial viscosity of the adhesive composition is between 20,000 cps and about 35,000 cps, including any value therebetween. In another example, the initial viscosity of the adhesive composition is between 30,000 cps and 40,000 cps, including any value therebetween. While certain ranges of initial mix viscosity are provided above, it is contemplated that the initial mix viscosity of the adhesive composition can be any value higher than 20,000 cps. The initial mix viscosity can range from 5000 cps to 70,000 cps based on the processing requirements. The adhesive compositions should be flexible in order to penetrate the interstices and voids in the membrane of a reverse osmosis module, but also should be strong enough to result high pressures to which the membrane is subjected to use thereof. After mixing the aforementioned components to form the adhesive composition, the adhesive composition is applied to the membrane of the reverse osmosis module. The adhesive composition is cured after application to the membrane. An example reverse osmosis module 10 is illustrated in FIG. 1, wherein the adhesive composition 12 is shown applied to at least a portion of a membrane 14. The example shown in FIG. 1 is only used for illustration purposes and is not meant to be limiting to the scope of the present invention. The adhesive composition can be cured through room temperature curing or heat curing. When the adhesive composition is fully cured, the adhesive will have certain properties that help impart beneficial characteristics to the adhesive composition when used in a reverse osmosis module. The adhesive composition typically has a Shore hardness of greater than about 20 A when fully cured. In another example, the adhesive composition has a Shore hardness of at least about 30 A when fully cured, while in another example the adhesive composition has a Shore hardness of at least about 40 A when fully cured. In yet a further example, the adhesive composition has a Shore hardness of at least about 35 D when fully cured. In a further example, the adhesive composition has a Shore hardness of between 35 D and 80 D when fully cured. In another example, the adhesive composition has a Shore hardness of between 60 A and 80 D. When fully cured, the adhesive composition should have tensile strength of greater than 100 psi, preferably greater than 500 psi. In another example, the adhesive composition has a tensile strength of greater than 1,000 psi, preferably greater than 2,000 psi when fully cured. The tensile strength can be measured by, for example, the Instron Tensiometer. It is contemplated that the adhesive composition can be applied to a desired membrane using any technique known in the art to apply such adhesives. For example, the adhesive composition may be applied to a membrane of a reverse osmosis module using any commercially available coater, such as a slot die coater. The adhesive composition may be applied as a layer having any desired thickness. In one example, the adhesive composition is applied in a layer of about 0.2 to about 4 mil thick, although other thicknesses can be applicable.

Table 2 also provides the components for Examples III-IV (comparative adhesive compositions). In Examples I-IV, part (B) of the polyurethane composition does not include a second polyol. Parts (A) and (B) of the adhesive compositions in Examples I-IX are synthesized according to the following procedures. Protocol for Synthesizing Part (A) in Examples I-IX: Weighed diisocyanate is charged into a reaction vessel equipped for agitation, vacuum, heating and cooling. SF 8843 defoamer is added to the reaction vessel. With agitation, 90 mole % (based on isocyanate) of the castor oil is added to the reaction vessel, at such a rate that the temperature rise does not exceed 85° C. After the castor oil is added, the reaction vessel is sealed under vacuum (at least at about 27 inch. Hg) and then heated at a temperature between about 80° C. to about 85° C. for four (4) hours to form the isocyanate group-containing pre-polymer of part (A). A sample of the isocyanate group-containing pre-polymer of part (A) is analyzed to determine NCO content according to ASTM D 2572. When necessary, additional castor oil is added and reacted under vacuum at a temperature between about 80° C. to about 85° C. for 2 hours to lower the NCO content to the target NCO value, i.e. 5% to 25% (mass percent) NCO content. If the calculated NCO content is lower than the target value, extra diisocyanate is added to increase the NCO content. The NCO content is determined again to ensure the NCO content is within the target value prior to use. Protocol for Synthesizing Part (B) in Examples I-IV: In the adhesive compositions of Examples I-IV, part (B) of the polyurethane composition does not include a second polyol and a thixotrope. Each of the adhesive compositions in Examples I-IV is synthesized by blending the polybutadiene diol, plasticizer and defoamer in a vessel for 30 minutes. Water is then stripped from the mixture so that the water content of the mixture is less than 0.04 wt. %. The catalyst is then added and the mixture is stirred between 40 and 45 minutes to result in a homogenous mixture. Protocol for Synthesizing Part (B) in Examples VI-IX In the adhesive compositions of Examples VI-IX, part (B) of the polyurethane composition includes a second polyol and a thixotrope. Each of the adhesive compositions in Examples VI-IX is synthesized by blending the polybutadiene diol, plasticizer and defoamer in a vessel for 30 minutes. Water is then stripped from the mixture so that the water content of the mixture is less than 0.04 wt. %. The second polyol, secondary diol EH diol, is added to, and blended with, the mixture after it is stripped of water so that the water content is 0.04 wt. % or less. The catalyst is then added to the mixture at room temperature and mixed followed by the thixotrope. The thixotrope is added to the mixture at room temperature and is mixed between 40 minutes and 45 minutes until a homogenous mixture is obtained.
