FIELD [0002] Provided herein are methods for treating or preventing chronic lymphocytic leukemia, comprising administering an effective amount of a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound to a patient having chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or T-cell pro lymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). 2. BACKGROUND [0003] The connection between abnormal protein phosphorylation and the cause or consequence of diseases has been known for over 20 years. Accordingly, protein kinases have become a very important group of drug targets. See Cohen, Nature, 1:309-315 (2002). Various protein kinase inhibitors have been used clinically in the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, such as cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases, including diabetes and stroke. See Cohen, Eur. J. Biochem., 268:5001-5010 (2001), Protein Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Disease: The Promise and the Problems, Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 167 (2005). [0004] The protein kinases are a large and diverse family of enzymes that catalyze protein phosphorylation and play a critical role in cellular signaling. Protein kinases may exert positive or negative regulatory effects, depending upon their target protein. Protein kinases are involved in specific signaling pathways which regulate cell functions such as, but not limited to, metabolism, cell cycle progression, cell adhesion, vascular function, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Malfunctions of cellular signaling have been associated with many diseases, the most characterized of which include cancer and diabetes. The regulation of signal transduction by cytokines and the association of signal molecules with protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been well documented. Similarly, the connection between diabetes and related conditions, and deregulated levels of protein kinases, has been demonstrated. See e.g., Sridhar et αℓ. Pharmaceutical Research, 17(11): 1345-1353 (2000). Viral infections and the conditions related thereto have also been associated with the regulation of protein kinases. Park et αℓ. Cell 101 (7): 777-787 (2000). [0005] Because protein kinases regulate nearly every cellular process, including metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell survival, they are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention for various disease states. For example, cell-cycle control and angiogenesis, in which protein kinases play a pivotal role are cellular processes associated with numerous disease conditions such as but not limited to cancer, inflammatory diseases, abnormal angiogenesis and diseases related thereto, atherosclerosis, macular degeneration, diabetes, obesity, and pain. [0006] Protein kinases have become attractive targets for the treatment of cancers. Fabbro et αℓ., Pharmacology & Therapeutics 93:79-98 (2002). It has been proposed that the involvement of protein kinases in the development of human malignancies may occur by: (1) genomic rearrangements (e.g., BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia), (2) mutations leading to constitutively active kinase activity, such as acute myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors, (3) deregulation of kinase activity by activation of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressor functions, such as in cancers with oncogenic RAS, (4) deregulation of kinase activity by over-expression, as in the case of EGFR and (5) ectopic expression of growth factors that can contribute to the development and maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype. Fabbro et αℓ., Pharmacology & Therapeutics 93:79-98 (2002). [0007] The elucidation of the intricacy of protein kinase pathways and the complexity of the relationship and interaction among and between the various protein kinases and kinase pathways highlights the importance of developing pharmaceutical agents capable of acting as protein kinase modulators, regulators or inhibitors that have beneficial activity on multiple kinases or multiple kinase pathways. Accordingly, there remains a need for new kinase modulators. [0008] The protein named mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), which is also called FRAP, RAFTI or RAPT1), is a 2549-amino acid Ser/Thr protein kinase, that has been shown to be one of the most critical proteins in the mTOR/PI3K/Akt pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation. Georgakis and Younes Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 6(1): 131-140 (2006). mTOR exists within two complexes, mTORCl and mTORC2. While mTORCl is sensitive to rapamycin analogs (such as temsirolimus or everolimus), mTORC2 is largely rapamycininsensitive. Notably, rapamycin is not a TOR kinase inhibitor. Several mTOR inhibitors have been or are being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Temsirolimus was approved for use in renal cell carcinoma in 2007 and sirolimus was approved in 1999 for the prophylaxis of renal transplant rejection. Everolimus was approved in 2009 for renal cell carcinoma patients that have progressed on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors, in 2010 for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS) in patients who require therapy but are not candidates for surgical resection, and in 2011 for progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (ΡΝΕΤ) in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease. There remains a need for additional TOR kinase inhibitors. [0009] DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs are considered to be the most lethal DNA lesion and occur endogenously or in response to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutics (for review see Jackson, S. Ρ., Bartek, J. The DNA-damage response in human biology and disease. Nature Rev 2009; 461:1071-1078). If left unrepaired, DSBs will lead to cell cycle arrest and/or cell death (Hoeijmakers, J. Η. J. Genome maintenance mechanisms for preventing cancer. Nature 2001; 411: 366-374; van Gent, D. C., Hoeijmakers, J. Η., Kanaar, R. Chromosomal stability and the DNA double-stranded break connection. Nat Rev Genet 2001; 2: 196-206). In response to the insult, cells have developed complex mechanisms to repair such breaks and these mechanisms may form the basis of therapeutic resistance. There are two major pathways used to repair DSBs, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). NHEJ brings broken ends of the DNA together and rejoins them without reference to a second template (Collis, S. J., DeWeese, Τ. L., Jeggo Ρ. A., Parker, A.R. The life and death of DNA-PK. Oncogene 2005; 24: 949-961). In contrast, HR is dependent on the proximity of the sister chromatid which provides a template to mediate faithful repair (Takata, Μ., Sasaki, Μ. S., Sonoda, Ε., Morrison, C., Hashimoto, Μ., Utsumi, Η., et al. Homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining pathways of DNA double-strand break repair have overlapping roles in the maintenance of chromosomal integrity in vertebrate cells. ΕΜΒΟ J 1998; 17: 5497-5508; Haber, J. Ε. Partners and pathways repairing a double-strand break. Trends Genet 2000; 16: 259-264). NHEJ repairs the majority of DSBs. In NHEJ, DSBs are recognized by the Ku protein that binds and then activates the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK. This leads to recruitment and activation of end-processing enzymes, polymerases and DNA ligase IV (Collis, S. J., DeWeese, Τ. L., Jeggo Ρ. A., Parker, A.R. The life and death of DNA-PK. Oncogene 2005; 24: 949-961). NHEJ is primarily controlled by DNA-PK and thus inhibition of DNA-PK is an attractive approach to modulating the repair response to exogenously induced DSBs. Cells deficient in components of the NHEJ pathway are defective in DSB repair and highly sensitive to ionizing radiation and topoisomerase poisons (reviewed by Smith, G. C. Μ., Jackson, S.P. The DNA-dependent protein kinase. Genes Dev 1999; 13: 916-934; Jeggo, Ρ.Α., Caldecott, Κ., Pidsley, S., Banks, G.R. Sensitivity of Chinese hamster ovary mutants defective in DNA double strand break repair to topoisomerase II inhibitors. Cancer Res 1989; 49: 7057-7063). A DNA-PK inhibitor has been reported to have the same effect of sensitizing cancer cells to therapeutically induced DSBs (Smith, G. C. Μ., Jackson, S.P. The DNA-dependent protein kinase. Genes Dev 1999; 13: 916-934).

[0069] As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “clathrate” means a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound, or a salt thereof, in the form of a crystal lattice that contains spaces (e.g., channels) that have a guest molecule (e.g., a solvent or water) trapped within or a crystal lattice wherein a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound is a guest molecule. [0070] As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “solvate” means a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound, or a salt thereof, that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of a solvent bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. In one embodiment, the solvate is a hydrate. [0071] As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “hydrate” means a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound, or a salt thereof, that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of water bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. [0072] As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “prodrug” means a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound derivative that can hydrolyze, oxidize, or otherwise react under biological conditions (in vitro or in vivo) to provide an active compound, particularly a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, derivatives and metabolites of a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound that include biohydrolyzable moieties such as biohydrolyzable amides, biohydrolyzable esters, biohydrolyzable carbamates, biohydrolyzable carbonates, biohydrolyzable ureides, and biohydrolyzable phosphate analogues. In certain embodiments, prodrugs of compounds with carboxyl functional groups are the lower alkyl esters of the carboxylic acid. The carboxylate esters are conveniently formed by esterifying any of the carboxylic acid moieties present on the molecule. Prodrugs can typically be prepared using well-known methods, such as those described by Burger’s Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery 6th ed. (Donald J. Abraham ed., 2001, Wiley) and Design and Application of Prodrugs (Η. Bundgaard ed., 1985, Harwood Academic Publishers Gmfh). [0073] As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “stereoisomer” or “stereomerically pure” means one stereoisomer of a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound that is substantially free of other stereoisomers of that compound. For example, a stereomerically pure compound having one chiral center will be substantially free of the opposite enantiomer of the compound. A stereomerically pure compound having two chiral centers will be substantially free of other diastereomers of the compound. A typical stereomerically pure compound comprises greater than about 80% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 20% by weight of other stereoisomers of the compound, greater than about 90% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 10% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, greater than about 95% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 5% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, or greater than about 97% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 3% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound. The Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds can have chiral centers and can occur as racemates, individual enantiomers or diastereomers, and mixtures thereof. All such isomeric forms are included within the embodiments disclosed herein, including mixtures thereof. The use of stereomerically pure forms of such Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds, as well as the use of mixtures of those forms are encompassed by the embodiments disclosed herein. For example, mixtures comprising equal or unequal amounts of the enantiomers of a particular Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound may be used in methods and compositions disclosed herein. These isomers may be asymmetrically synthesized or resolved using standard techniques such as chiral columns or chiral resolving agents. See, e.g., Jacques, J., et αℓ., Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions (Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1981); Wilen, S. Η., et αℓ., Tetrahedron 33:2725 (1977); Eliel, Ε. L., Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds (McGraw-Hill, NY, 1962); and Wilen, S. Η., Tables of Resolving Agents and Optical Resolutions ρ. 268 (E.L. Eliel, Ed., Univ. of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, IN, 1972). [0074] It should also be noted the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds can include Ε and Ζ isomers, or a mixture thereof, and cis and trans isomers or a mixture thereof. In certain embodiments, the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds are isolated as either the cis or trans isomer. In other embodiments, the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds are a mixture of the cis and trans isomers. [0075] “Tautomers” refers to isomeric forms of a compound that are in equilibrium with each other. The concentrations of the isomeric forms will depend on the environment the compound is found in and may be different depending upon, for example, whether the compound is a solid or is in an organic or aqueous solution. For example, in aqueous solution, pyrazoles may exhibit the following isomeric forms, which are referred to as tautomers of each other: [0076] As readily understood by one skilled in the art, a wide variety of functional groups and other structures may exhibit tautomerism and all tautomers of the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds are within the scope of the present invention. [0077] It should also be noted the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds can contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I), sulfur-35 (35S), or carbon-14 (14C), or may be isotopically enriched, such as with deuterium (2H), carbon-13 (13C), or nitrogen-15 (15N). As used herein, an “isotopologue” is an isotopically enriched compound. The term “isotopically enriched” refers to an atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. “Isotopically enriched” may also refer to a compound containing at least one atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. The term “isotopic composition” refers to the amount of each isotope present for a given atom. Radiolabeled and isotopically enriched compounds are useful as therapeutic agents, e.g., cancer and inflammation therapeutic agents, research reagents, e.g., binding assay reagents, and diagnostic agents, e.g., in vivo imaging agents. All isotopic variations of the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds as described herein, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the embodiments provided herein. In some embodiments, there are provided isotopologues of the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds, for example, the isotopologues are deuterium, carbon-13, or nitrogen-15 enriched Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds. [0078] It should be noted that if there is a discrepancy between a depicted structure and a name for that structure, the depicted structure is to be accorded more weight. [0079] The B-cell disorders chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) represent two ends of a spectrum of the same disease process differing in the degree of blood/marrow involvement (CLL) versus lymph node involvement (SLL). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most common leukemia in the U.S. and is typically characterized immunophenotypically as CD5+, CD23+, CD10-, CD19+, CD20 dim, slg dim, and cyclin Dl(the latter point a distinguishing feature from mantle cell lymphoma). [0080] T-cell-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a mature T-cell leukemia with aggressive behavior and predilection for blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and skin involvement. T-PLL is a very rare leukemia, primarily affecting adults over the age of 30. It represents 2% of all small lymphocytic leukemias in adults. T-PLL has the immunophenotype of a mature (post-thymic) T-lymphocyte, and the neoplastic cells are typically positive for pan-T antigens CD2, CD3, and CD7 and negative for TdT and CD la. The immunophenotype CD4+/CD8- is present in 60% of cases, the CD4+/CD8+ immunophenotype is present in 25%, and the CD4-/CD8+ immunophenotype is present in 15% of cases [0081] The term “ATM” as used herein, refers to Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), a serine/threonine protein kinase that is recruited and activated by DNA double-strand breaks. ATM phosphorylates several key proteins that initiate activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis. Several of these targets, including ρ53, CHK2 and Η2ΑΧ are tumor suppressors. The ATM gene codes for a 350 kDa protein consisting of 3056 amino acids. [0082] The term, “deletion of 1 lq” or “dell lq22” as used herein, refers to deletion of all or part of the long arm of chromosome 11 containing the ATM gene within tumor cells. [0083] “Treating” as used herein, means an alleviation, in whole or in part, of CLL or T-PLL, or a symptom thereof, or slowing, or halting of further progression or worsening of CLL or T-PLL or a symptom thereof. In some embodiments, the CLL is a CLL characterized by deletion of all or part of chromosome 1 lq, loss or mutation of the gene encoding ATM (including biallelic ATM mutations), loss of ATM expression or function, mutation of IgVH, wild type IgVH, wild type ρ53/ΑΤΜ, mutation of ρ53, dysfunctional ρ53 or Zap-70 positivity.

[0085] The term “effective amount” in connection with a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound means an amount capable of alleviating, in whole or in part, symptoms associated with CLL or T-PLL, or slowing or halting further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or treating or preventing CLL or T-PLL. The effective amount of the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound, for example in a pharmaceutical composition, may be at a level that will exercise the desired effect; for example, about 0.005 mg/kg of a subject’s body weight to about 100 mg/kg of a patient’s body weight in unit dosage for both oral and parenteral administration. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, it is to be expected that the effective amount of a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound disclosed herein may vary depending on the severity of the indication being treated. In some embodiments, the CLL is characterized by deletion of all or part of chromosome 1 lq. In other embodiments, the CLL is characterized by deletion of chromosome 1 lq22.

[0087] In certain embodiments, treatment of CLL or T-PLL may be assessed by the inhibition of phosphorylation of S6RP, 4Ε-ΒΡ1 and/or ΑΚΤ in circulating blood cells and/or skin biopsies, before, during and/or after treatment with a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound. In other embodiments, treatment of CLL or T-PLL may be assessed by the inhibition of DNA-PK activity in skin samples and/or tumor biopsies/aspirates, such as by assessment of the amount of pDNA-PK S2056 as a biomarker for DNA damage pathways, before, during, and/or after Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound treatment. In one embodiment, the skin sample is irradiated by UV light. In the extreme, complete inhibition, is referred to herein as prevention or chemoprevention. In this context, the term “prevention” includes either preventing the onset of clinically evident CLL or T-PLL altogether or preventing the onset of a preclinically evident stage of CLL or T-PLL altogether or preventing the onset of a preclinically evident stage of CLL or T-PLL. [0088] In certain embodiments, the treatment of CLL or T-PLL may be assessed by the International Workshop Criteria (IWC) for malignant lymphoma (see Cheson BD, Pfistner Β, Juweid, ME, et. al.

[0093] In other embodiments, treatment of CLL or T-PLL may be assessed by the inhibition of DNA-PK activity in skin samples and/or tumor biopsies/aspirates, such as by assessment of the amount of pDNA-PK S2056 as a biomarker for DNA damage pathways, before, during, and/or after TOR kinase inhibitor treatment, for example, a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound. In one embodiment, the skin sample is irradiated by UV light. [0094] In the extreme, complete inhibition, is referred to herein as prevention or chemoprevention. In this context, the term “prevention” includes either preventing the onset of clinically evident CLL or T-PLL altogether or preventing the onset of a preclinically evident stage of CLL or T-PLL. Also intended to be encompassed by this definition is the prevention of transformation into malignant cells or to arrest or reverse the progression of premalignant cells to malignant cells. This includes prophylactic treatment of those at risk of developing CLL or T-PLL. 4.2 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0095] FIG. 1A provides the toxicity of Compound 1 and etoposide on CLL cells.

The usual carriers and diluents include, but are not limited to, inert powdered substances such as starch of many different kinds, powdered cellulose, especially crystalline and microcrystalline cellulose, sugars such as fructose, mannitol and sucrose, grain flours and similar edible powders. [00200] Tablets can be prepared by direct compression, by wet granulation, or by dry granulation. Their formulations usually incorporate diluents, binders, lubricants and disintegrators as well as the compound. Typical diluents include, for example, various types of starch, lactose, mannitol, kaolin, calcium phosphate or sulfate, inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and powdered sugar. Powdered cellulose derivatives are also useful. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is lactose-free. Typical tablet binders are substances such as starch, gelatin and sugars such as lactose, fructose, glucose and the like. Natural and synthetic gums are also convenient, including acacia, alginates, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine and the like. Polyethylene glycol, ethylcellulose and waxes can also serve as binders. [00201] A lubricant might be necessary in a tablet formulation to prevent the tablet and punches from sticking in the die. The lubricant can be chosen from such slippery solids as talc, magnesium and calcium stearate, stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable oils. Tablet disintegrators are substances that swell when wetted to break up the tablet and release the compound. They include starches, clays, celluloses, algins and gums. More particularly, com and potato starches, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, wood cellulose, powdered natural sponge, cation-exchange resins, alginic acid, guar gum, citrus pulp and carboxymethyl cellulose, for example, can be used as well as sodium lauryl sulfate. Tablets can be coated with sugar as a flavor and sealant, or with film-forming protecting agents to modify the dissolution properties of the tablet. The compositions can also be formulated as chewable tablets, for example, by using substances such as mannitol in the formulation. [00202] When it is desired to administer a Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound as a suppository, typical bases can be used. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, which can be modified by addition of waxes to raise its melting point slightly. Water-miscible suppository bases comprising, particularly, polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights are in wide use. [00203] The effect of the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound can be delayed or prolonged by proper formulation. For example, a slowly soluble pellet of the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound can be prepared and incorporated in a tablet or capsule, or as a slow-release implantable device. The technique also includes making pellets of several different dissolution rates and filling capsules with a mixture of the pellets. Tablets or capsules can be coated with a film that resists dissolution for a predictable period of time. Even the parenteral preparations can be made long-acting, by dissolving or suspending the Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compound in oily or emulsified vehicles that allow it to disperse slowly in the serum.

The following is an example of an assay that can be used to determine the TOR kinase inhibitory activity of a test compound. TOR kinase inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and prepared as 10 mM stocks and diluted appropriately for the experiments. Reagents were prepared as follows: [00220] “Simple TOR buffer” (used to dilute high glycerol TOR fraction): 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT. Invitrogen mTOR (cat#PV4753) was diluted in this buffer to an assay concentration of 0.200 pg/mL. [00221] ATP/Substrate solution: 0.075 mM ATP, 12.5 mM MnCfr, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM β-ϋΟΡ, 250 ηΜ Microcystin LR, 0.25 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 3.5 pg/mL GSTp70S6. [00222] Detection reagent solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.01% Triton Χ-100, 0.01% BSA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 12.7 pg/mL Cy5-aGST Amersham (Cat#PA92002V), 9 ng/mL a-phospho p70S6 (Thr389) (Cell Signaling Mouse Monoclonal #9206L), 627 ng/mL a-mouse Lance Eu (Perkin Elmer Cat#AD0077). [00223] To 20 pL of the Simple TOR buffer is added 0.5 pL of test compound in DMSO. To initiate the reaction 5 pL of ATP/Substrate solution was added to 20 pL of the Simple TOR buffer solution (control) and to the compound solution prepared above. The assay was stopped after 60 min by adding 5 pL of a 60 mM EDTA solution; 10 pL of detection reagent solution was then added and the mixture was allowed to sit for at least 2 hours before reading on a Perkin-Elmer Envision Microplate Reader set to detect LANCE Eu TR-FRET (excitation at 320 nm and emission at 495/520 nm). [00224] Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds were tested in the mTOR HTR-FRET assay and were found to have activity therein, with certain compounds having an IC50 below 10 μΜ in the assay, with some compounds having an IC50 between and 0.005 ηΜ and 250 ηΜ, others having an IC50 between and 250 ηΜ and 500 ηΜ, others having an IC50 between 500 ηΜ and 1 μΜ, and others having an IC50 between 1 μΜ and 10 μΜ. [00225] DNA-PK assay. DNA-PK assay is performed using the procedures supplied in the Promega DNA-PK assay kit (catalog # V7870). DNA-PK enzyme can be purchased from Promega (Promega cat#V5811). [00226] Selected Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds as described herein have, or are expected to have, an IC50 below 10 μΜ in this assay, with some Dihydropyrazino-Pyrazine Compounds as described herein having an IC50 below 1 μΜ, and others having an IC50 below 0.10 μΜ. 5.2.2 Cell based assays [00227] Growth inhibition assay for CLL patient cells. A compound can be tested as follows: A test compound (a DHPP set forth herein) is dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare a 10 mM stock solution. A serial titration is performed to produce a working concentration range of 1.5 μΜ to 10 mM. Aliquots to produce final concentrations of 1.5 ηΜ to 10 μΜ are spotted via an acoustic dispenser (EDC ATS-100) into an empty 384-well plate. The test compound is spotted in a 10-point serial dilution fashion (3-fold dilution) in duplicate within the plate. The DMSO concentration is kept constant for a final assay concentration of 0.1% DMSO. Plates are replicated for use with different cell lines and testing periods. After compound plate replication, all plates are sealed (Agilent ThermoLoc) and stored at -20°C for up to 1 month. When ready for testing, plates are removed from the freezer, thawed, and unsealed just prior to the addition of the test cells. Cells are then diluted to the appropriate densities and added directly to the test-compound-spotted 384-well plates. Cells are allowed to grow for 72 hours at 37 °C/5% CO2. At the time when test compounds are added (to), initial cell numbers are assessed via a viability assay (Cell Titer-Glo) by quantifying the level of luminescence generated by ATP present in viable cells. After 72 hours, cell viability of test-compound-treated cells is assessed via Cell Titer-Glo and luminescence measurement. Cells are assayed for increased cell death by the test compound in at least 3 independent tests. A control cell line is included in each of the assays. The test compound response against this control cell line is monitored closely to enable comparison of the data generated through the assay period. All data are normalized and presented as a percentage of the DMSO-treated cells. Results are then expressed as a IC50 value. The OIC50 value corrects for the cell count at time zero. [00228] Apoptosis assay for CLL cells. Cells are diluted to their desired densities and added directly to test-compound-spotted 384-well plates. Cells are incubated for 24 hours in 5% CO2 at 37°C. The apoptotic response is assessed by quantifying the activities of caspase 3 and caspase 7 (Caspase 3/7-Glo) in treated cells and control cells at the 24-hour time point. All data is normalized and represented as a value relative to the DMSO-treated cells. Results are then expressed as CalX, which is the minimum test compound concentration required to double the levels of caspase 3/7 relative to those of the DMSO-treated cells during their treatment period. [00229] CLL- Coculture assay. Materials and Methods. Cells and culture media: There are two types of cell in the co-culture system: the feeder cells which are L929 mouse fibroblasts stably transfected with CD40 Ligand (CD40L) (supplied by Laura Corral- Celgene-San Diego); and primary PBMC from CLL patients (CLL-PBMC) obtained from commercial sources (AllCells; Conversant Bio). The feeder cells are routinely maintained in DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Before co-culture, feeder cells are treated with mitomycin to prevent their proliferation and plated overnight in 24-well plates. The primary CLL-PBMC cells are stored frozen in liquid nitrogen vapor-phase until needed; thawed and labeled with CFSE dye (Invitrogen) to a homogeneous fluorescence immediately prior to co-culture with feeder cells. Co-culture medium consists of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the cytokines IL-4 (5 ng/ml) and IL-10 (15 ng/ml). [00230] Measurement of anti-proliferative effects of compounds on primary CLL PBMC. The CLL-PBMC co-culture assay is performed to determine the effect of the compounds in the proliferation of CLL-PBMC. The assay consists of culturing CFSE-labeled CLL-PBMC on the surface of the mitomycin-treated feeder cells previously plated. Compounds (in DMSO stock solutions) are added to the culture in duplicate at different concentrations to a final DMSO concentration of 0.01%. Plates are incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for up to 12 days. At intervals of 3 to 6 days, CLL-PBMC are gently collected by repeated pipetting and transferred to 96 well plates. Cells are acquired by a flow cytometer and the data is imported into FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). The CFSE fluorescence intensity is analyzed as it corresponds to the number of cell divisions the cells have undergone in culture during the incubation period. In this way, the percentage of cells that have divided can be calculated. The numbers of cells affected by compound treatment is normalized to DMSO control and the data is imported into Excel or GraphPrism. IC50 is the compound dose at which a 50% inhibition of proliferation is achieved normalized to DMSO control. [00231] Compound toxicity assay for CLL patient cells. Primary CLL patient cells, stratified as being wildtype or del(l lq) by clinical-grade FISH analysis, were seeded onto a feeder layer of CD40 ligand-expressing NIH 3Τ3 cells prior to treatment with Compound 1, etoposide or a combination of both compounds. Wildtype CLL cells were highly sensitive to etoposide, but resistant to Compound 1. Addition of Compound 1 to the etoposide regimen did not significantly enhance the response of the ATM-proficient CLL cells (FIG. 1 A). In contrast, del(l lq) CLL cells were exclusively sensitive to Compound 1, but largely resistant to etoposide (FIG. IB). These data suggest that DNA-PK inhibition might be a useful strategy to treat chemotherapy-resistant, ATM-defective CLL. [00232] CLL patient cells apoptosis assay. Patient material (pheripheral blood) was obtained from CLL patients (diagnosed according to the NCI-WG guidelines) after routine follow-up or diagnostic procedures at the department of hematology of the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and stored in liquid nitrogen, as cell suspension in heat-inactivated fetal calf serum containing 10% DMSO. During all in vitro experiments, cells were maintained in culture medium: Iscove’s modified Dulbecco medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 pg/mL gentamycin and 0.00036 % P-mercaptoethanol. All samples contained at least 90% CD5+/CD19+ cells as assessed via flow cytometry. B-CLL cells were thawed and diluted to a concentration of 1.106 cells/mL in IMDM plus supplements as described above. 100 pL of CLL cells were placed in a 96-well plate and treated with increasing levels of Compound 1 for 48 hours. Apoptosis was analyzed by evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential with DioC6 (Molecular probes). Cells were incubated with 10 ηΜ DioC6 for 30 minutes at 37 °C and 20 pg/mL propidium iodide was added to measure cell death. Expression of DioC6 was determined using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest software was used for data acquisition. Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar, San Carlos, CA, USA). Specific apoptosis is defined as % cell death in Compound 1 treated cells - % cell death in medium control using the Graphpad Prism software (Graphpad Prism 5.0, Fa Jolla, USA). The results are set forth in FIGs. 2Α -2Η. [00233] Induction of apoptosis by Compound 1 in CLL cells. Reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (RT-MFPA) was performed to determine the impact of Compound 1 on the mRNA expression levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic regulators. [00234] Cell Culture and detection of apoptosis. PBMC from CFF patients were thawed and incubated with different concentrations of Compound 1 for 48 hours. Where indicated, CFF cells were co-cultured in the presence/absence of 20 μΜ of the pancaspase inhibitor QvD or 5 mM N-acetyl-F-cysteine (NAC). CFF cell viability was measured by analysisof mitochondrial transmembrane potential by 3,3-dihexyloxocarbocyanine iodine (DiOC6;Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) and cell membrane permeability to propidium iodide (PI; Sigma Aldrich) using the FACS Calibur flow cytometer. Specific apoptosis is defined as [% cell death in drug treated cells] - [% cell death in medium control] / [% viable cells medium control] χ 100 using the Graphpad Prism software (Graphpad Prism 5.0, Fa Jolla, USA). [00235] Reverse transcription-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay. CFF Cells were harvested per stimulation, washed with PBS, resuspended in RNA lysis buffer (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) and stored at -80 °C. RNA was isolated using the GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep kit (Sigma-aldrich). The concentration and purity of the RNA were dertemined with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Willington, USA). Reverse transcription-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (RT-MFPA) procedure was performed as described previously by Eldering et αℓ. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003;31 :℮153. In brief, 40-60 ng of total RNA of samples were first reverse transcribed using a gene-specific probe mix (R016-X2). The resulting cDNA was annealed overnight at 60 °C to the MFPA probes. The annealed oligonucleotides were covalently linked by Ligase-65 (MRC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) at 54 °C. Ligation products were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR; 33 cycles, 30 sec at 95 °C, 30 sec at 60 °C and 1 min at 72 °C) using one unlabeled and on 6-carboxy-fluorescin-labelled primer (10 ρΜ). PCR products were mixed with 1 ρΜ ROX 500 size standard and separated on an ABI 3100 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom) in Genescan mode. Results were analyzed using the programs Genescan analysis and Genotypes (Applied Biosystems). Data was further analyzed with Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet software. Normalization was performed by setting the sum of all data per sample at 100% and individual peaks were calculated relative to the 100% value. [00236] Results. Wildtype CLL cells were highly sensitive to etoposide, but resistant to Compound 1. Addition of Compound 1 to the etoposide regimen did not significantly enhance the response of the ATM-proficient CLL cells (LIG. 1Α). In contrast, del(l lq) CLL cells were exclusively sensitive to Compound 1, but largely resistant to etoposide (LIG. IB). These data suggest that DNA-PK inhibition might be a useful strategy to treat chemotherapy-resistant, ATM-defective CLL. [00237] Compound 1 induced apoptosis in cells from patients belonging to 4 distinct prognostic groups. Compound 1 induced apoptosis in IGVH mutated CLL cells (LIGs. 2Α, Ε), IGVH unmutated CLL cells (LIGs. 2Β, L), ATM mutated CLL cells (LIGs. 2D, G) and Ρ53 mutated CLL cells (LIGs. 2C, Η). [00238] Compound 1-induced apoptosis was ρ53 independent (LIG. 3). Levels of the proand apoptotic regulators on RNA level, including above mentioned ρ5 3-target genes were not altered upon treatment with Compound 1. In order to study whether induction of cell death by Compound 1 was caspase dependent, cells were preincubated with the pan-caspase inhibitor QvD. As shown in LIG. 3, QvD could completely block cytotoxicity of the kinase inhibitors. A variety of chemotherapeutic drugs induce apoptosis in CLL cells by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To learn whether the observed cytotoxicity dependent on ROS formation, CLL cells were co-treated with NAC which did not result in inhibition of kinase-induced cell death (LIG. 3). [00239] Adhesion of CLL cells to fibronection is inhibited by Compound 1. BCRmediated adhesion of primary CLL cells (LIG. 4) was tested. Only IgVH unmutated samples were used as most mutated samples are anergic for in vitro BCR-activation. CLL cells pretreated with 1 μΜ Compound 1 were stimulated with algM or ΡΜΑ and allowed to adhere to fibronectin-coated surfaces (η=5). Compound 1 strongly inhibited the anti-IgM-stimulated integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin. [00240] Compound 1 blocks CD40-mediated activation of CLL cells. Western blot analysis was performed using standard techniques [Hallaert et αℓ. Blood 2008;(112):5141-5149], Samples (50 pg protein) were separated by 13% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Membranes were probed with anti-p-S6, ρ-4ΕΒΡ1, p-Akt (Thr308), p-Akt (Ser473) (Cell Signaling), Bim (Stressgen Bioreagents Canada) and antiserum to P-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as loading control. Blots were subsequently incubated with IRDye 680 or 800 labelled secondary antibodies for 1 hour. Odyssey Imager (Li-Cor Biosciences) was used as a detection method according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the p-DNA-PK western blot, cells were lysed in RIPA sample buffer and sonificated. Samples (50 pg protein) were separated by mini protean TGX gels (Biorad). Transfer onto Immobilon-FL transfer membrane (Millipore) in lx transfer buffer, 20% Μ℮ΟΗ at 30 volts at 4 °C overnight. The following antibodies were used: p-DNA-PK (Ser2056) (Abeam), ΚΑΡ (TIF1B), phosphorylated-KAP (phospho-TIFlB-ser824;Cell Signalling) and P-actin (Santa Cruz). [00241] Expression of cell surface markers. Cells were washed and resuspended in staining media (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA)). For analysis of expression of cell surface markers, different combinations of antibodies were used. CD54-PE and CD95-FITC purchased from Pharmingen. CD44-Alexa Fluor 700 was obtained from eBiosciences and CD58 from Immunotech. After incubation for 30 minutes at 4 °C protected from light, cells were washed twice in PBS/0.5% BSA and expression of cell surface markers was analyzed using FACSCalibur flow cytometry. Specific upregulation is defined as [MFI 3Τ40 control - MFI drug treated cells] / [MFI 3Τ40 control - MFI 3Τ3 control] χ 100 using the Graphpad Prism software. [00242] Results. In unstimulated CEE cells, phosphorylation of S6, the downstream effector of mTORCl (raptor), could be completely blocked by Compound 1 (FIG. 5). In the lymph node microenvironment CLL cells receive pro-survival signals of surrounding cells and we previously showed that prolonged in vitro stimulation with CD40L resembles the lymph node microenvironment with respect to induction of NF-kB mediated pro-survival signaling (Tromp JM , et αℓ. Ongone 2010;29(36): 5071-82). The downstream effectors of mTORCl, p-S6 and ρ-4ΕΒΡ1, and the downstream effector of mTORC2, p-Akt (Ser473) are upregulated in activated CLL cells and could be completely blocked by Compound 1 (FIG. 6). To further investigate the impact of Compound 1 on CD40-mediated activation of CLL cells, levels of blast cell formation was assessed. CLL cells co-cultured with CD40L showed increased blast-like appearance which was completely blocked by Compound 1 (LIG. 6). Lurthermore, CD40 triggering increases the expression of a variety of immune accessory molecules such as death receptors (CD95) and adhesion receptors (CD54, CD58, CD44). Compound 1 showed significant inhibition of 3T40Linduced upregulation of immune accessory molecules (LIG. 6). [00243] Compound 1 reverts CD40-induced chemoresistance. CD40 stimulation inhibits spontaneous cell death as previously reported [Burger et αℓ. Blood 2009;(114):2560-2561], Lymphocytes of CLL patients were stimulated by coculture with NIH3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with human CD40L or negative control plasmid (3Τ3) as described before [Pascutti et αℓ Blood 2013 2013; 122(17):3010-9], CLL cells were cocultured in the presence/absence of Compound 1 at the indicated concentrations. After 72 hours of culture, CLL cells were detached and either used for flowcytrometic analyses or subsequently incubated with or without Lludarabine (Sigma) for an additional 48 hours. CLL cell viability was measured as by DiOC6/PI staining as described above. Compound 1 inhibited the CD40L-induced survival (LIG. 7). CD40L stimulation induces resistance to cytotoxic agents, including fludarabine [Kater et αℓ. Brit J Haematology 2004; 127:404-415], Compound 1 partly reversed fludarabine sensitivity. Co-treatment with Compound 1 completely abolished CD40-induced fludarabine resistance (LIG. 7). [00244] Results. CLL cells originating from lymph nodes show an altered expression of apoptotic genes including increased expression of Bcl-XL , Bfl-1 and Bid and decreased expression of Bim. Together, these alterations result in resistance to various drugs. To analyze if Compound 1 changed the CD40-mediated alterations in expression levels of anti- and pro apoptotic genes, expression levels of pro and anti-apoptotic molecules by RT-MLPA in CD40L triggered CLL cells was studied. Compound 1 blocked CD40-mediated inhibition of BIM and decreased the upregulation of BID (LIG. 7). We next measured whether induced changes in RNA expression levels of BIM also resulted in altered BIM protein levels. CD40-mediated decreased expression of Bim was blocked by coculture with Compound 1 (FIG. 7). [00245] Compound 1 completely blocks proliferation of CLL cells. Activated Τ cells and follicular helper Τ cells present in the LN express membrane-bound CD40L and can secrete cytokines such as IL-21 that induces BCR-independent proliferation. [00246] PBMC (1,0xl07/mL) were labelled with 0,5μΜ carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Molecular Probes) as described before [Pascutti et αℓ Blood 2013 2013; 122(17):3010-9]. Cells were cultured on 3T40L cells, in absence or presence of recombinant human IL-21 (25ng/ml, Gibco, Invitrogen), with or without 1 μΜ of Compound 1. After 4 days, proliferation was assessed in a FACS Canto (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJosoftware (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). [00247] Results. As can be seen in FIGs. 8Α and 8Β, proliferation is indeed strongly induced by the combination of CD40 activation and IL-21 stimulation. Proliferation of CLL cells is fully blocked by Compound 1. 5.2.3 Clinical Study A [00248] Phase IB, Multi-Center, Open-Label, Dose Finding Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of Compound 1 Administered Orally to Subjects with CLL Characterized by Deletion of All or Part of Chromosome llq or Loss or Mutation of the Gene Encoding ATM, or Loss of ATM Expression or Function.

[00279] Study Objectives. [00280] The primary objectives of the study are to : (1) determine the safety and tolerability of Compound 1 when administered orally; (2) define the non-tolerated dose (NTD) of Compound 1; (3) define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Compound 1; and (4) determine the pharmacokinetics (ΡΚ) of Compound 1, when Compound 1 is administered to patients having CLL characterized by deletion of all or part of chromosome 1 lq or loss or mutation of the gene encoding ATM, or loss of ATM expression or function. [00281] The secondary objectives of the study are to: (1) evaluate the extent of inhibition of phosphorylation of S6RP and/or 4Ε-ΒΡ1 for mTORCl activity and ΑΚΤ and/or other relevant biomarkers for mTORC2 activity in blood, skin and/or tumor biopsies/aspirates, when available before and during treatment with Compound 1; (2) evaluate the inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activity in skin samples irradiated by UV light, circulating leukemia or other tumor cells, and/or tumor biopsies/aspirates using pDNA-PK S2056 and/or other relevant biomarkers for DNA damage pathways before and during Compound 1 treatment; and (3) evaluate the efficacy of Compound 1. [00282] Study Design. [00283] In this study, Compound 1 is administrated orally to patients having CLL or T-PLL characterized by deletion of all or part of chromosome 1 lq, loss or mutation of the gene encoding ATM, loss of ATM expression or function, mutation of IgVH, wild type IgVH, wild type ρ53/ΑΤΜ, mutation of ρ53, dysfunctional ρ53 or Zap-70 positivity. [00284] This Phase la/lb study has two parts, dose escalation (Part A) and dose expansion (Part Β). [00285] In Part A, cohorts of subjects will initially receive once-daily (QD) ascending doses of Compound 1 to measure ΡΚ and identify the MTD. A modified accelerated titration design (Simon. R, ei αℓ, J Nat Cane Institute 1997;89(15): 1138-1147) will be used to identify initial toxicity. During the accelerated phase, initial cohorts of one subject will be given Compound 1 in dose increments of 100% until the first instance of first-Cycle grade 2 or higher toxicity suspected to be drug-related, at which point the accelerated phase will stop and that particular cohort will be expanded to a total of 6 subjects. Subsequently, a standard escalation schedule with approximately 50% dose increments and 6-subject cohorts will be initiated in order to establish the NTD and MTD. Smaller increments within a dose cohort may be evaluated, if necessary. Cohorts may also be expanded for reasons other than toxicity based on review of ΡΚ and pharmacodynamic (PD) data, as well as on findings from tumor biopsies. [00286] Based on interim ΡΚ and PD results from initial dose cohorts, a twice-daily (BID) dosing regimen will also be evaluated in Part A. This will be initiated in cohorts of 6 subjects at or below a total daily dose level already shown to be tolerable, but divided into two equal doses administered approximately 12 hours apart. Thereafter, dose escalation for QD and BID dosing cohorts may occur independently. Intermittent dosing schedules of comparable or lower dose intensity than continuous daily dosing may also be considered for evaluation. [00287] A dose will be considered the NTD when 2 or more out of 6 evaluable subjects in a cohort experience drug-related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1. Once the NTD is established, dose escalation will stop. The MTD is defined as the last dose level below the NTD with 0 or 1 out of 6 evaluable subjects experiencing DLT during Cycle 1. An intermediate dose (ie, one between the NTD and the last dose level before the NTD) or additional subjects within any dose cohort may be required to more precisely determine the MTD, as may alternate regimens if emerging PK-PD results suggest these may be appropriate. [00288] In Part Β, adult subjects will start Compound 1 at 10 mg BID. A total of approximately 100 subjects will be evaluated for safety and antitumor activity periodically. Cohorts with up to 20 subjects/cohort, will be included. [00289] A clinical pharmacology substudy will be performed in 12 evaluable subjects in the US. This is designed specifically to provide intrasubject ΡΚ comparisons for the current capsule and a recently formulated tablet, and to assess the effect of food on Compound 1 bioavailability to determine whether fasting restrictions around Com pound 1 dosing could be lifted.

[00298] Subjects start Compound 1 QD or BID dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1 in Part A, and adult subjects with 10 mg BID in Part Β, all subjects receiving treatment in 28-day cycles. Compound 1 may be discontinued when there is evidence of tumor progression, but subjects can continue to receive study drug as long as the investigator considers they are deriving benefit. Therapy will be discontinued when there is unacceptable toxicity or the subject decides to withdraw from the study. [00299] The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as pre-specified in the protocol and/or the Statistical Analysis Plan, whichever is the later date. [00300] Enrollment is expected to take about 30 months to complete. Extended treatment for responding subjects and follow-up may last another 3-6 months. [00301] Study Treatments. [00302] In Part A, the dose level will start at 0.5 mg QD. After the first dose is administered in any cohort, subjects are observed for at least 28 days before the next higher, protocol-specified dose cohort can begin. The total number of subjects in Part A depends on the number of dose cohorts needed to establish the MTD, and it is estimated that approximately 30-50 subjects will be enrolled in Part A. [00303] Both QD and BID dosing will be evaluated in Part A. Twice-daily dosing will be initiated in cohorts of 6 subjects at or below a total daily dose level already shown to be tolerable, divided into two equal doses. Thereafter, dose escalation for QD and BID dosing cohorts may occur independently. Intermittent dosing schedules of comparable or lower dose intensity than continuous daily dosing, and intermediate doses between two dose levels already evaluated in Part A, may be investigated in Part Β. In Part Β, adult subjects will start Compound 1 at 10 mg BID. Approximately 100 subjects will be evaluated for safety and antitumor effects. [00304] Compound 1 will be provided as capsules for oral administration. Most subjects will start Compound 1 at 10 mg BID. [00305] Overview of Efficacy Assessments. [00306] All treated subjects will be included for the efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy variable is tumor response, based on investigator assessment using the updated criteria of the National Cancer Institute-Sponsored Working Group on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (NCI-WG CLL, 2008).

[00309] In Part A, the decision to either evaluate a higher dose level or declare a MTD will be determined by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) each time clinical and laboratory safety data for a given cohort are available for review. The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will also determine the dose, doses, or schedule appropriate for Part Β. During Part Β, the SRC will continue to review safety data regularly and make recommendations about the study continuation, as appropriate. [00310] Overview of Pharmacokinetic Assessments. [00311] The ΡΚ profiles of Compound 1, and any major metabolites detected, will be determined from serial blood and urine collections, including tumor tissue when available, and correlated with PD outcomes, where possible.
