Preparation of trans-2-chloro-N-(4-((4-chlorobenzyl)amino)-2-methylphenyl)-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide (F1010)
4-Chlorobenzaldehyde (0.0252 g, 0.179 mmol) was added to a stirred suspension of trans-N-(4-amino-2-methylphenyl)-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide (DP4) (0.100 g, 0.179 mmol) and sodium acetate (29.4 mg, 0.359 mmol) in methanol (20 mL), water (15 mL) and acetic acid (3 mL). The resulting heterogeneous mixture was stirred at 25° C. for 3 hours. Sodium cyanoborohydride (0.0158 g, 0.251 mmol) was added in one portion. The resulting colorless solution was stirred at ambient temperature for another 4 hours. The reaction mixture was quenched with water (50 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (3×50 mL). The organic extracts were washed successively with water and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under vacuum on a rotary evaporator. Purification by silica gel flash chromatography provided the title compound as a yellow foam (0.087 g, 68%).
