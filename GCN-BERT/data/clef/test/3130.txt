FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention belongs to the field of cosmetics. Specifically, it relates to a bee venom composition with the effects of protecting and beautifying lips. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Lips play a vital role in facial beauty, in addition to the function of eating, talking and smiling. The majority of people have thin lips with fuzzy lip lines and dim lip color. In order to have moisturized, sexy and plump lips, many people are attentive to personal appearance undertake lip augmentation surgery, which is very expensive, tormenting due to its side effect or adverse drug reaction. In the meantime, as the only mucosal tissue of the entire body that is always exposed to the air, lips are ⅓ of the thickness of the body skin. They are very fragile, tender and very sensitive to the outside environment. They have no sweat gland or sebaceous gland, cannot secrete grease by themselves and therefore lack a natural protective membrane. In dry and windy environment, lips will lose water easily and become dry, chapped and even desquamated. Lips have no pigment and are easily hurt by ultraviolet rays and become dim. With the increase of age, collagens in the cuticle of the lip skin decrease gradually, therefore the skin becomes lax, more and deeper lip wrinkles appear. Moreover, with poor living habits, weak physique, incomplete makeup removal and use of poor quality lip balm, the lips are easy to be inflamed and even suffer malignant lesions which induce skin cancer. Therefore, lip care cannot be ignored. Different from skin of the other parts of the body, lips need a product with a long moisturizing effect so as to moisturize the skin of the lips and make the lips plump. At present, there are various kinds of lip care products in the market. However, a great part of them belong to the moistening or cosmetic products such as lip balm, lipstick and lip stain. Few of them have the effect of beautifying lips such as sun blocking, repairing, lip wrinkle eliminating or lip plumping. Meanwhile, those products can only temporarily remit dryness of lips or serve as the makeup. After they are removed, the condition of lip skin is not improved at all. On the contrary, the lip skin contacting allergen ingredients such as vaseline, mineral oil, chemical synthetic grease, paraffin, earth wax, colorants and essence will get dependent and allergic easily, and therefore the malaise of the lips will be increased. Therefore, it is urgent in need to develop lip protecting and beautifying products which is safe, gentle, long lasting, cheilitis preventing and appearance improving. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The objective of the present invention is to provide a safer and more efficient bee venom composition with the effects of protecting and beautifying lips, which can effectively relieve the symptoms of lip dryness, chap and desquamation, has effects of moisture retaining, nourishing, sun blocking, repairing, lip plumping and lip wrinkle eliminating, and can comprehensively enhance the lip skin's capability to resist the outside environment. It overcomes the problem that the present lip care products have no obvious effect such as improving lip dryness, desquamation or chap, which will result in dependence and allergy of skin or even more discomfort of lips, etc. The bee venom composition with effects of protecting and beautifying lips according to the present invention comprises matrix ingredients for lip care products, characterized by also comprising bee venom. Preferably, the bee venom is prepared by the following method: crude bee venom is dissolved with water, followed by ultrafiltration using a membrane with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) 10000 Da, and the filtrate is then freeze-dried to obtain the bee venom. This present method of bee venom purification simplifies the bee venom purification process, saves costs and can effectively collect and concentrate the active substances with the effects of beautifying and skin-caring, such as melittin and apamin. Due to the removal of substances which may cause an allergic reaction, inflammation and pain to the skin, such as hyaluronidase and phospholipase A2, the method remarkably enhances the effects of protecting and beautifying lips while at the same time, ensuring product safety and preventing irritation and allergy. The purification method solves the problem that the active substances with the effects of beautifying and skin-caring are ineffectively enriched in the prior art, and fills in the gap of the bee venom's application in cosmetics protecting and beautifying lips. Preferably, the aforementioned bee venom accounts for 0.00001%-2% of the total mass of the bee venom composition. Preferably, the bee venom is prepared by the following method: crude bee venom is completely dissolved with 10-30 times volume of water, followed by centrifugation at 5,000-10,000 g for 10-30 min; the supernatant is ultrafiltered using a membrane with a MWCO of 10,000 Da, and the filtrate is then frozen and dried to obtain the bee venom. Preferably, the bee venom composition with the effects of protecting and beautifying lips further comprises moisturizing ingredient(s) which account(s) for 0.01%-15% of the total mass of the bee venom composition. The adding of moisturizing ingredient(s) can enhance the bee venom's effects of moisturizing, lip plumping, and lip wrinkles reducing, etc. The moisturizing ingredient may be one or more selected from the group consisting of honey, hyaluronic acid, allantoin, aloe extract and algae extract. It can be obtained from the market, or can alternatively be prepared by the existing method. Preferably, the bee venom composition with the effects of protecting and beautifying lips further comprises repairing ingredient(s) that account(s) for 0.01%-5% of the total mass of the bee venom composition. The adding of repairing ingredient can enhance the bee venom's effects of repairing, sun blocking, lip brightening and lip wrinkles reducing, etc. The repairing ingredient(s) may be one or more selected from the group consisting of Vitamin E acetate, Vitamin C magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, coenzyme Q10, olive oil and grape seed oil. It can be obtained from the market, or can alternatively be prepared by the existing method. The crude bee venom may be crude wasp venom and/or crude honeybee venom, which can be collected by a bee venom collector or obtained from the market. The matrix ingredients for the lip care products used in the present invention are common in this field. Those skilled in the art can select the matrix ingredients according to the various kinds of lip care products to be prepared. The matrix ingredients of lip care products can be obtained from the market. The bee venom composition with the effects of protecting and beautifying lips according to the present invention is prepared by the following method: the bee venom in the form of powder or aqueous solution in a mass concentration of 10-50%, is homogenized or mixed together with other ingredients. The bee venom composition can be prepared by conventional processes according to the kind of the product to be prepared. The bee venom composition with the effects of protecting and beautifying lips according to the present invention may be a lip balm, lip cream, lip gloss, lip stain or lip mask. The bee venom and the matrixes of lip care products, and the moisturizing ingredient(s) and/or repairing ingredient(s) which may optionally be further comprised, can be prepared by conventional processes to obtain the lip balm, lip cream, lip gloss, lip stain or lip mask. The bee venom composition with the effects of protecting and beautifying lips according to the present invention has high stability, coating uniformity and good spreadability. Animal experiments and human body experiments prove that the bee venom composition with the effects of protecting and beautifying lips according to the present invention is safe. It does not induce irritation or allergy to the skin, and can effectively prevent and relieve the symptoms of lip dryness, chap and desquamation. It can comprehensively enhance the self-protection capability of the lip skin, prevent the skin from the injury of UV, brighten the lip, eliminate lip wrinkles and plump the lip. Therefore, the bee venom composition with the effects of protecting and beautifying lips according to the present invention can be used as common lip care products or functional care products with the effects of moisturizing, nourishing, sun-blocking, repairing, lip plumping and lip wrinkle eliminating. The present invention is developed based on the understanding of the lip tissue structure, causes and the protection method of the cheilitis, lip beautifying mechanism and the skin-caring effects of functional active ingredients, with the combination of the study findings on modern lip protecting and beautifying care products and the pharmacology. The bee venom, moisturizing ingredient(s) and repairing ingredient(s) with obvious effects of skin moisture retaining, microcirculation promoting, skin injury repairing, UV radiation resisting, inflammation eliminating, lip wrinkles reducing and lip plumping, are selected from numerous functional active ingredients, and scientifically formulated, to give a full play to the function of moisturizing, nourishing, sun-blocking, repairing, lip plumping and lip wrinkle eliminating. The bee venom in the bee venom composition with the effects of protecting and beautifying lips according to the present invention is rich in active ingredients such as melittin, apamin, catecholamine, free amino acids, vitamins, microelements and glycerin. The molecular weights are low. It is weak in immunogenicity, does not tend to generate anaphylactic reaction, even can relieve the allergenicity of the lip care product matrixes such as the vaseline, mineral oil, chemical synthetic grease, paraffin, earth wax, colorants and flavor, to the skin. Melittin has obvious effects of anti-oxidation and UV radiation prevention. It can eliminate inflammation and delay skin aging. It can also block the exciting conduction in the nerve synapse and weaken the flaccid paralysis and muscular tension of the lip muscles under control, so as to make the lips plump and the lip wrinkles reduced or eliminated. Apamin can enhance the capillary permeability, improve microcirculation, promote metabolism of epidermis cells and make the skin cells rejuvenate. Catecholamine has anti-inflammation effect on the skin injury by light and is good for wound healing. Active substances such as free amine acids, vitamins and microelements are helpful to the skin moisture retaining, nutrients nourishing. They are effective in anti-oxidation, tyrosinase inhibition, protection the skin from UV damage, and can comprehensively enhance the functions of the natural barrier of the skin. Glycerinum can absorb moisture in the air, prevent the skin moisture from evaporating, achieve the moistening effect and is helpful to improve the skin's self-repairing capability. The moisturizing ingredient, honey, of the bee venom composition, is rich in nutrients, which can directly act on epidermis and dermis to provide nutrients to cells. It has moisturizing and nourishing effect, making the lip skin fine and elastic. In addition, it can recover the lip healthy and make it ruddy, reduce or eliminate lip wrinkles. Hyaluronic acid is a substance with the best moisturizing effect at present. It can seep into the corium layer, retain cellular water, prompt the proliferation of the epidermis cells and wound healing, and make the dry, chapped and desquamated lip skin to recover tenderness and smoothness. The hyaluronic acid can also prompt active ingredients such as the bee venom to be absorbed by the skin, so as to enhance the lip beautifying effect. Allantoin can promote the growth of the epithelial cells to make the epidermis to be granular quickly, providing enough water to the intercellular space when metabolizing the cutin, to make the lip skin tender and plump. The aloe extract is rich in amino acids, organic acids, polysaccharides and microelements. It can promote the active ingredients such as the bee venom to go deep into the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue, to make the lip skin smooth, soft and moist. The algae extract contains a great amount of sulfate heteropolysaccharide, which can improve the hydrature of the lip skin, reduce loss of water, re-build the natural barrier for the skin and increase the lipid granule content of the epidermal granular layer. These moisturizing ingredients and the bee venom have an obvious synergistic effect, which can obviously enhance the effects of the bee venom composition provide herein for moistening, nourishing, plumping and wrinkle reducing to the lip. The repairing ingredient, Vitamin E acetate, in the bee venom composition of the present invention, can release free Vitamin E after seeping into the skin. Vitamin E is an important antioxidant and stabilizer in the cell membrane. It can retain the skin moisture, eliminate free radicals, inhibit lipid peroxidation, maintain the link between the elastic fibers and the collagenous tissue, accelerate cell repair and regeneration, improve lip cracking and eliminate lip wrinkles obviously. The Vitamin C magnesium ascorbyl phosphate can release free Vitamin C after seeping into the skin. As an endogenous antioxidant, Vitamin C can effectively eliminate free radicals, reduce the inflammatory response caused by UV, activate collagen metabolism, repair sunburned skin and postpone skin photoaging. In addition, Vitamin C can also enhance the stability and effectiveness of the lip care products. Coenzyme Q10 is an effective supplement of the endogenous coenzyme Q10 in epidermis cells. It can accelerate the blood microcirculation, promote metabolism of the lip skin and proliferation of the epidermis cells, recover skin elasticity, and has obvious effects of relieving lip dimness, cracking and lip wrinkles caused by natural aging, light and diseases. Olive oil has rich squalene with very high affinity and essential fatty acids. It can be quickly absorbed by skin and maintain the elasticity and glossiness. Olive oil also contains unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and phenols, etc., which can eliminate the lip wrinkles and prevent the skin from aging, and has obvious effects of relieving the dry and chapped symptoms of the lips. Grape seed oil contains linoleic acid, proanthocyanidin, polyunsaturated fatty acid, mineral substances, and can be very easily absorbed by skin. Grape seed oil can also help the skin to absorb Vitamin C and E, promote microcirculation, protect the collagen fibers and elastic fibers to resist UV damage, moisten the lip skin and reduce generation of the lip wrinkles. These repairing ingredients and the bee venom have an obvious synergistic effect, which can obviously enhance the effect of the bee venom composition of the present invention for sun blocking, repairing, lip brightening, and lip wrinkles reducing. Compared with the prior art, the present invention has the following advantages: 1. Aiming at the lip skin's special physiological structure and sensitivity to the ingredients of cosmetics or skin care products, the bee venom composition with effects of protecting and beautifying lips of the present invention preferably applies pure natural bee venom as the main material.

The mice were horizontally fixed on iron frames and placed at a distance of 10 cm vertically away from the ultraviolet lamps to receive UV radiation for 6 h to make the mice models with damaged skin. The epidermal keratinization and chap degree of the mice were used as the evaluation indexes to describe the changes on the back skin of the mice, and the samples' effects of protecting the mice skin against UV damage were evaluated. The mice with damaged skin were radiated for 40 h continuously before sacrificed by cervical dislocation and then weighed. The round section of two ears and the section of the back skin with a diameter of 9 mm were taken and weighed to obtain the accurate mass. Ear index (ear index=mass of ear section/mass of mouse) and skin index (skin index=mass of skin section/mass of mouse) were calculated, followed by analysis on the samples' effect on restraining the edema of mice caused by UV radiation. The back skins were taken and fixed with 10% of formaldehyde for 24 h to obtain the sealed samples. The sealed samples were placed under 10× microscope to observe the overall skin shape. Then a first picture was taken from the top of the skin observed under 40× microscope; after that, a following picture was taken when the graticule was moved every 2 mm. After 5 pictures were shot, 5 points on each picture were selected with the microscopic image analysis system to measure the surface thickness thereof. A total of 25 points were measured for each sealed sample, and the average values were recorded as the epidermis thickness to analyze the samples' effects on restraining the epidermal keratinization of the mice. Six view fields were taken from each picture, followed by calculation of the number of fibroblasts in each view field. The average value was recorded as the number of the dermal fibroblast in each view field. The test results of ear index, skin index, epidermis thickness and fibroblast number of the UV damaged mice were shown as Table 1.

Cosmetic composition containing bee venom and repairing ingredients (i.e., sample F, wherein the total mass content of the bee venom and the repairing ingredients was 2%): F1: 0.5% of wasp venom, 1% of Vitamin E acetate, 0.5% of Vitamin C magnesium ascorbyl phosphate and 98% of cosmetic matrix; F2: 0.4% of honeybee venom, 0.4% of wasp venom, 0.2% of coenzyme Q10, 0.5% of olive oil, 0.5% of grape seed oil and 98% of cosmetic matrix. 39 healthy volunteers were selected including 11 males and 28 females, aged 37-42, with an average age of 40.3. The volunteers had no serious systemic diseases, immunodeficiency or autoimmune diseases, were not allergic to cosmetics, and did not suffer facial acute inflammation, used no glucocorticoid or immunosuppressor, participated in no other clinic tests, and not coated with any other external preparations. They were randomly divided into 13 groups, namely the group of cosmetic matrix, the group of cosmetic composition containing crude bee venom (samples A1-A2), the group of cosmetic composition containing bee venom (samples B1-B2), the group of cosmetic composition containing moisturizing ingredients (samples C1-C2), the group of cosmetic composition containing bee venom and moisturizing ingredients (samples D1-D2), the group of cosmetic composition containing repairing ingredients (samples E1-E2), and the group of cosmetic composition containing bee venom and repairing ingredients (samples F1-F2). Three persons were included in each group. The samples were respectively applied onto the lip skin of the volunteers of each group. After 4 h, lip skin improving effects were evaluated. The skin hydration (%) in the cuticle of the lip was measured using Corneometer® CM 825. Lip skin elasticity was measured using Cutometer® dual MPA 580 (the negative pressure was kept at 450 mbar during measuring). The biological elasticity was represented by the ratio of retraction Ur (i.e., the recovery value of the skin after the negative pressure was removed for 0.1 s) to the total deformation Uf of the skin. The closer the value approached 1, the better the skin elasticity was. The skin wrinkles of the lips were measured using Skin-Visiometer® SV 600 (a skin wrinkle mold in accordance with the tested position was build using silicon mold. The grade classification and statistic treatment were carried out according to the depth of the skin wrinkles by a computer). The average roughness R3 of the skin was calculated before and after the use of the samples (i.e., taking the arithmetic average of values R1 obtained through measuring five different segments with identical length, wherein R1 represented the distance between the peak value and the valley value in a certain length, μm). The result was represented by ΔR3 (i.e., the difference of the average skin roughness between before and after using the samples). The higher the value was, the better the effect of wrinkles relieving was. The same lip site was photographed using DIGIMIC800 skin image analyzer to measure the change of thickness (μm) before and after the samples applied to the lips. The change of lip color was measured using the Spectrophotometer CM-2600d (L* value represented the lightness of skin. The higher the L* was, the lighter the skin was. The difference value ΔL* of the skin lightness before and after using the samples can represent the change in the skin color). The test results were shown in Table 2, wherein the sample A represented the average value of the groups of samples A1, A2; sample B represented the average value of the groups of samples B1, B2; sample C represented the average value of the groups of samples C1, C2; sample D represented the average value of the groups of samples D1, D2; sample E represented the average value of samples E1, E2; and sample F represented the average value of the groups of samples F1, F2.
