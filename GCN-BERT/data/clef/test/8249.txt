Example 5: Synthesis of Compound 1.6
Compound 1.5 (30.0 g, 104 mmol), DMAP (1.22 g, 10 mmol) and triethylamine (30.4 g, 300 mmol) were dissolved in 300 mL of dichloromethane. Benzoyl chloride (28.1 g, 200 mmol) was dropwise added thereto under room temperature. Upon completion of the dropwise adding, raise the temperature until reflux, and react for 10 hours. When TLC shows complete reaction, the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and 200 mL of dichloromethane was further added. The reaction solution was washed once with 100 mL of water, and the organic phase was washed once with 2N HCl (150 mL) and once with saturated brine (100 mL). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to obtain an oily matter, and the oily matter was dissolved in 300 mL of acetone. 50 mL of water was slowly added thereto, solids were gradually precipitated. Cool to 0-5Â° C. for 2-4 hours, and filtered to obtain white powder solid compound 1.6 (38.2 g, yield: 95%).
