RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority in accordance with 37 C.F.R. §1.19(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/985,020 filed Apr. 28, 2014 for MULTI-PURPOSE WALLET WITH HOLDER FOR MULTIPLE WRITING INSTRUMENTS which is included herein in its entirety by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to pocket organizers. More particularly, the invention relates to pocket wallets used for carrying items such as credit cards, identification cards, money (in paper form), folded cards such as golf score cards, writing pads and the like with a means to securely carry multiple writing instruments. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Persons, for example, sports officials, law enforcement officers, military members, medical professionals, and the like, frequently find themselves in situations where they must quickly either reference information or document information. Often, these tasks occur simultaneously or nearly simultaneously and are frequently done in austere environments, that is, in environments devoid of writing materials, writing instruments, etc. in the cold and rain. While it is nearly impossible because of practical considerations for professionals such as the ones cited above to have every reference at their immediate disposal, it is usually feasible to have their most important and most often needed reference material at their fingertips. It would, therefore, be advantageous to provide a pocket-sized multi-purpose wallet capable of holding individualized material (e.g., reference material), writing instruments, and media, either custom printed or commercially available off-the-shelf) upon which to write. It would be further advantageous to provide a multipurpose wallet that functions satisfactorily under any weather conditions by exhibiting durability enough to withstand both heat and cold and provide resistance to water, rain and snow. It would be further advantageous for the multipurpose wallet to secure writing instruments and make such writing instruments readily retrievable and restorable. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention there is provided a multipurpose wallet that overcomes shortfalls of all wallets known to the inventor. The novel wallet of the invention has a unique yet simple design that provides the user with quick access to any printed material contained within. The design provides water-resistant pouches typically integrated into the front and back covers. Paper documents, cards or the like may be inserted into these pouches. When the water-resistant pouches are formed from a transparent material, at least the outside of the documents or cards may be viewed without removing the documents from the water-resistant pouches. The center portion of the wallet may have a center channel whereby one or more clips retained by the center channel may be used to retain folded cards or “leaflets”. A writing instrument holder may be affixed to one or more of the covers, typically the outside surface of either the front or back cover. The wallet is constructed at least in part from a durable weather resistant, water resistant vinyl-type material for the exterior panel of the wallet and a clear vinyl for the interior panel.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention provides a wallet or folio for securing and protecting reference material, media upon which to write, writing instruments, etc. The wallet provides protection from the elements by providing water resistant pouches/pockets into which reference material to be protected may be placed. For simplicity, the term wallet is used to describe any wallet, folder, folio, etc. formed from a folded substantially rectangular sheet of material. A wallet has a generally accepted definition as a container that resembles a money wallet (e.g., a billfold). A wallet is usually a flexible folding case fitted for carrying specific items (e.g., tools or fishing flies or lures, etc.) Therefore, the wallet in accordance with the invention may be of any size in addition of a traditional billfold sized structure. An exemplary wallet is produced and sold by Game-AIDE for specific use by referees or judges of athletic endeavors. It will be recognized by those of skill in the art that the novel wallet of the invention potentially has many other applications. Referring first to FIGS. 1A and 1B, there are shown a top plan and a side elevational view, respectively of a simplified laminated wallet structure forming the core of a wallet in accordance with the invention, generally at reference number 100. Wallet core 100 is typically formed in two layers; from an outer member 102 and an inner member 104 selectively attached thereto. Both outer member 102 and inner member 104 are substantially rectangular and have a respective major axis 106 and a minor axis 108. Both outer member 102 and inner member 104 are typically formed from a flaccid polymeric material, typically PVC or vinyl. PVC may have some advantages over vinyl in typical applications of the novel wallet. For example, PVC material tends to maintain its flexibility in cold environments PVC and also conforms to the body when wallet is carried in a pocket. PVC and vinyl both exhibit good water resistance. It will be recognized that in alternate embodiments of the novel wallet that other materials may be utilized to form one or both of outer member 102 or inner member 104. Materials such as leather, nylon or cotton could theoretically be used, particularly for outer member 102. However, the water resistance ability of such materials, even if treated, is typically poorer than the water resistance of either PVC or vinyl. Therefore, the preferred material for the main body panel is PVC or vinyl with PVC performing better overall. Outer member 102 is typically formed from an opaque material while inner member 104 is typically formed from a transparent material. Outer member 102 is selectively bonded to inner member 104 in such a manner as to form hollow pockets 118a, 118b, best seen in FIG. 2, between outer member 102 and inner liner 104. In addition, no adhesive is applied at a region adjacent a centerline 110 parallels to minor axis 108 proximate a midpoint of major axis 106. Bonding of outer member 102 and inner lines 104 is typically accomplished with a selectively applied thin adhesive later 112. Adhesive layer 112 is typically formed using solvent cement. Solvent cements are known to form molecular bonds between surfaces of the two layers being joined (e.g., outer member 102 and inner member 104). Such molecular bonds create a permanent adhesion without significantly altering the physical characteristics of the material, thereby maintaining the flexibility of the materials without compromising their integrity. Further, when properly bonded with solvent cement, the formed pouches 118a, 118b provide satisfactory water-resistance for most applications. It will be recognized by those of skill in the art that there are numerous alternatives to solvent bonding outer member 102 to inner member 104. Such alternatives include, but are not considered limited to ultrasonically welding, RF bonding, thermal sealing, stitching, joining with a non-solvent bonding cement or adhesive, attaching using fasteners, etc. None of these alternate methods of joining outer member 102 to inner member 104 provides the desirable features of molecular bonding using solvent cement. Most alternate methods either impact material flexibility or material integrity that may cause premature material failure, particularly in cold weather. Surrounding centerline 110 is a center channel 114 formed by buckling inner member 104 and pulling it inwardly away from outer member 102. Center channel 114 is discussed in more detail hereinbelow. Referring now also to FIG. 2, there is shown an orthogonal view a wallet 200 formed from wallet core 100 of FIGS. 1A and 1B, wallet 200 shown in flat, fully open orientation showing the wallet layers, interior surfaces, pouches, pockets and retainer clips. Pouches or pockets 118a, 118b are formed between outer member 102 and inner member 104. As may be clearly seen in FIG. 1A, adhesive 112 is placed around three sides of outer member 102 to define pouches 118a, 118b. The lower edge, not specifically identified, is free from adhesive 112. In FIG. 2, the edge considered the lower edge is shown as the right-most edge. The adhesive free regions at the lower edges form openings 122a, 122b that allow insertion of a card or other document. Inside pockets 116a, 116b are formed by adhesively affixing an additional sheet of material 124a, 124b to an inside surface of inner member 104, typically only partially covering the surface of inner member 104. Sheet material 124a, 124b is substantially the same transparent material used to form inner member 104. Access to inside pockets 116a, 116b is typically from a top edge 126a, 126b of material 124a, 126b, respectively. Retainer clips 120, best seen in FIG. 5, have their upper and lower folded portions 140a, 140b, respectively, retained in upper and lower regions, not specifically identified, of center channel 114. Referring now also to FIG. 3, there is shown a top plan, schematic view of the wallet of FIG. 2 showing pouches or pockets 118a, 118b with indicia-bearing cards 128a, 128b, respectively retained completely or partially therein. Indicia-bearing cards 128a, 128b form no part of the invention and are included to illustrate the typical use of wallet 200. Indicia-bearing card 128a is shown fully inserted in pouch or pocket 118a. Indicia-bearing card 128b is shown only partially inserted in inside pouch or pocket 118b. Indicia-bearing card 128b is inserted at opening 122b and moved upwardly in the direction shown by arrow 130. Referring now also to FIG. 4, there is shown a top or bottom plan, schematic view of the wallet 200 in a closed position and showing a writing instrument holder 132 affixed to an outside surface of outer member 102 and a writing instrument 136a having a retaining clip 146a retained completely within instrument retaining region 134a of instrument holder 132. A second writing instrument 136b has only a retaining clip 146b retained in instrument retaining region 134b. It will be recognized that other thin, elongated object may be retained in writing instrument retaining regions 134a, 134b in addition to writing instruments per se. In alternate embodiments, the size of instrument retaining regions 134a, 134b may be dissimilar, not shown, to accommodate specific writing instrument or other items in instrument holder 132. Writing instrument holder 132 is typically formed by another flat sheet of flexible material adhesively attached, preferably solvent bonded to an outside surface of outer member 102. Writing instruments 136a, 136b forming no part of the invention, are disposed in writing instrument retaining sleeves 134 of writing instrument holder 132. While a single writing instrument holder 132 may be disposed on either a front or rear cover of wallet 200, a second writing instrument holder 132 may be added to the other of front or rear covers, thereby providing instrument holders 132 on both the front and rear covers of wallet 200. It will be recognized by those of skill in the art that writing instrument retaining sleeves 134 may be configured to retain writing instruments, not shown, having different specific geometries. Consequently, the invention is not considered limited to the configuration of writing instrument retaining sleeves134 chosen for purposes of disclosure. Further, while two writing instrument retaining sleeves 134 are shown, fewer or more writing instrument retaining sleeves 134 may be substituted for the two writing instrument retaining sleeves 134 chosen for purposes of disclosure. Consequently, the invention is intended to encompass any and all different configurations and number of instrument retaining sleeves 134. Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown a side elevational, schematic view of a typical retaining clip 120 for use with the wallet 200. Retaining clip 120 has an elongated central region 138 with bent, hook-like end regions 140a, 140b at proximal and distal ends of central region 138, respectively. Bent hook-like regions 140a, 140b are configured and adapted for retention within center channel 114. Retainer clips 120 hold folded items such as cards, leaflets, money or other foldable objects within wallet 200. Retainer clips 120 may readily be added to or removed from wallet 200 as needed. Typically, wallet 200 may be configured without or with one, two, three or more retainer clips 120. Removing unneeded retaining clips 120 when they are not needed allows wallet 200 to have the thinnest possible profile at any given time. Retainer clips 120 may be formed from a rigid material such as metal, plastic fiberglass or any similar material. Because in certain application wallet 200 and its contents may be exposed to moisture, forming retaining clips from a rust resistant material is desirable. In alternate embodiments, string or elastic type retainers, neither shown, typically looped through the center channel 114 may be substituted for rigid retainer clips 120. Referring now also to FIG. 6, there is shown a side elevational, schematic view of the wallet 200 disposed in a partially open state. In FIG. 6, three retaining clips 120 are installed in center channel 114. A folded card 142, best seen in FIG. 7 and forming no part of the invention is shown retained on one of the three retaining clips 120. Pouches or pockets 118a, 118b and writing instrument holder 132 with writing instrument retaining sleeves 134 are also clearly shown. Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown a representative example of folded card 142. A fold line 144 shows the point where folded card 142 is folded. Since other modifications and changes varied to fit particular operating requirements and environments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the invention is not considered limited to the example chosen for purposes of disclosure, and covers all changes and modifications which do not constitute departures from the true spirit and scope of this invention.
