The present invention has as an aim a process of prépa¬ ration of the 13-alcoyl optically active gona-pentaenes of general formula: in which R represents a radical alkyl comprising from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and in which can be in position 1,2 and/or 4, a radical lower alcoxyle or a radical lower alkyl, in position 6 and/or 7, a radical lower alkyl, such as methyl, in position 3, a radical alcoxyle lower than the place of the radical methoxyl. L, invention more particularly has as an aim a nou¬ calf proceeded of preparation of the 13P-R gona-1,3,5 (10), 8,14-PEN taenes of general formula IX: .IX in which R represents a radical alkyl comprising from 1 to 3 carbon atoms. The 13P-R gona-1,3,5 (10), 8,14-pentaenes of general formula IX, described by Gordon Alan Hughes in the patent améri¬ cain No 3,202,686 of August 24th, 1965, have interesting naux hormo- effects. These compounds are estrogenes acting in a favorable way on the blood lipid level. It is known that the aim always by the chemist s-téroïïdien is to find a process of synthesis çluI while being linear and ramified has a character sufficiently conver¬ race in which, in addition, the reactions are stéréospéci- fic - in the desired direction and who allows an early unfolding, preferably with possibility of recovery of nondesired isomer. Mais* whereas certain syntheses published so far answer one or the other of these desideratas, one knows few processes which realize, even partially, these requirements in a simultaneous way. 1° the process of the invention has several advantages and is distinguished, inter alia, by a very marked character of convergence: indeed, in this process, one links two molecules comprising each one half of the carbonaceous skeleton of the oestrone which one completes the synthesis in a limited number of stages. Par. elsewhere, the invention offers the possibility of proceeding, the pre¬ miers three stages achieved, with the isomer opti¬ unfolding quement active and this with recovery of bad isomer, avan¬ considerable tage of this process, by a transformation which brings back it to a structure where substance is inactive by nature” Another advantage of this process resides in the fact of requiring only few stereospecific reactions, which besides can be realized with satisfactory outputs. . method of preparation of the 13-alcoyl optically active gona-pentaenes of general formula: E CHO in which R represents a radical alkyl comprising from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and in which can be in positions 1,2 and/or 4, a radical lower alcoxyle or a radical lower alkyl, in position 6 and/or 7, semi radical lower alkyl, such as methyl, in position 5, a radical alcoxyle lower than the place of the radi¬ cal methoxyl, is characterized in that one condenses a 2-R cyclopentane 1,3-clione with an alkyl acrylate, “the radical alkyl compor¬ so much from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, while operating in alkaline medium, obtains the 3 (L, - E 2”, 5, -dioxo cyclopentyl) propionate of corresponding alkyl, that one makes react with an agent of cetalisation, saponifies the DLL--Cl'-R E'-X -oxo cyclopentyl) resulting alkyl propionate, .0 X representing the group C J; R” where R” means radical 0 alkylene comprising from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, substituç or not, using an alkaline agent, proceeds to the unfolding of acid DLL--Cl'-R 2 ' - X -oxo cyclopentyl) propionic obtained in its antipodes optical with assistance D. “a optically active base, such as D (-) thréo (1-p. nitrophényl) 2-N, N-diméthylamino propane 1,3-diol, the L (+) thréo (1-p. nitrophényl) 2-N, L! ~diméthyl- amino propane 1,3-diol, cinchonin, the yohimbine, 1-NOR adrenalin, quinine or the 1-éphédrine, subjects acid 3 (L” - R 2 ' - X 5 ' - oxo cyclopentyl) propionic optically active isolated to the action from an agent of lactonization, optically obtains the lactone of acid 3 (l'-R 2, - X 5t-hydroxy 4 ' - cyclopentényl) propionic activates corresponding, that one condense with a halide of 3-m-méthoxy phénylpropylmagnésivmi, chosen among bromide, the chloride and the iodide, subjects the product of conden¬ sation to the action of an alkaline agent, obtient.le 3-méthoxy 9-oxo 13-R 17-X 9,10-séco gona-l, 3,5 (lO), 8 (l4) - optically active tetraene, corresponding, subjects this last to the action of an agent of cyclization and insulates the 3-inéthoxy 13-R 17-oxo gona-1,3,5 (10), 8,14 - sought optically active pentaene. The process according to the invention referring more parti¬ culièrement to the preparation of composed of general formula IX is summarized on the diagram on pages 29 and 50 of the present descriptive report in which the various substituents have the above mentioned signifi¬ cations, and E' represents a radical alkyl comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. . • The aforementioned process is characterized in that one condenses a 2-R cyclopentane-L, 3-dione (L) with an acrylate D” alkyl (II, R' = alkyl), while operating in alkaline medium, obtains the 3 (L, ~R 2 “, 5, - dioxo cyclopentyl) propionate of alkyl (III, R' = alkyl), (inactive by nature), which one makes react with an agent of cetalisation, saponifies the dl~3- (L, - R 2 “- X 5 ' - oxo cyclopentyl) propionate of resulting alkyl (IV, R' = alkyl), using an alkaline agent, proceeds to the unfolding of the acid DLL-S-tl'-R 2 ' - X 5, - oxo cyclopentyl) propionic obtained (V) in its antipodes optical using a optically active base, subjects isomer of natural configuration of acid 3 (l'-R e'-X 5, - oxo cyclopentyl) propionic (GOES), with the action of an agent of lactonieation, obtains the lactone of acid 3. (l'-R 2 ' - X It-liydroxy 4, - cyclopentényl) propionic (VI) corresponding, that one condenses with a halide of 3-m-méthoxy phénylpropyl- magnesium (VII, halide = Hal), the product of condensa~ tion subjects to the action of an alkaline agent, obtains the 3 ' - méthoxy 9-oxo 13P-R 17-X 9,10-séco gona-I, 2,5 (10), 8 (14) - tetraene (VIII), that. one subjects to the action of an agent of cyclization and isolates the 3-niéthoxy 13P-R 17-oxo gona-l, 3,5 (lO), 8,14-pentaene (IX) sought. As it was higher specified an advantage consi¬ dérable of this process resides in the fact of allowing the recovery of nondesired isomer obtained at the time of the unfolding. For that, one subjects this isomer to the action of an aqueous acid which causes the cleavage of the function cétal and provides acid 3 (L, - R 2 ', 5 ' - dioxo cyclopentyl) propionic (Vc) 'inactive by 4. \ Has 916158 nature, then one transforms this one into acid DLL-3 (L! ~R 2, - X 5, - oxo cyclopentyl) propionic (V) by action of an agent of cetalisation followed by an aqueous alkaline treatment of which the goal is of .saponifier the ester of the function carboxyl, intermédiai- rement formed. Banns its procedures, this process can be one of the chief features of which is the nonrestrictive following points: - the alkalinity of the medium of condensation of the 2-R cyclopentane 1,5-dione with an alkyl acrylate is ensured by the présen- it of a tertiary amine, such as the triéthylamine; - the agent of cetalisation which one makes react with one 3 (l'~R. 2 ', 5, - dioxo cyclopentyl) propionate of alkyl is an alkylene glycol or a dioxolane, such as the méthyléthyldioxolane in the presence of ethylene glycol, and one operates in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as the sulphonic acid p-toluèhe or the acid methylsulfonic; - the saponification of the DLL-3 (l'-R 2 ' - X 5 ' - oxo cyclopentyl) propionate of alkyl is carried out using an alkaline base, as soda or the potash; “- the unfolding of acid DLL-3 (Lr 2, - X S” - oxo cyclopentyl) propionic is carried out using a optically active base, such as cinchonin, D (-) thréo (LP. - nitrophényl) 2-Iï, H-diniéthylarairie propane 1,3-diol or 1-NOR adrenalin; - the agent of lactonization is the anhydride of an acid aliphati- that inferior, such as acetic anhydride, in the presence of an alkaline metal salt of a lower aliphatic acid, such as the sodium acetate; “- the condensation of the lactone of acid 3 (Lr 2” - X -hy droxy 4 ' - cyclopentényl) propionic with a halide of 3-ia-méthoxy phénylpropylmagnésium, such as bromide, is carried out in an ether, such as the tétrahydrofuran, and the subsequent alkaline treatment is carried out using a base; S 916158 V alkaline strong, such q.ue the potash métlianoliquc; - the agent of cyclization is a strong acid, such as a mineral acid like the acid suifuric, the acid ehloxhydric and. phosphoric acid or a sulfonic acid; - the agent of cyclization is a phosphoric mixture of acid and d1anhydride phosphoric and one operates at a temperature about 70oC. The invention also aims an alternative of the process above in which the alkyl acrylate (II) is replaced by acrylonitrile. The condensation of this one with the 2-R cyclo pentane 1,3-dione (I) in alkaline medium leads to the 3 (l'-R 2 ', 5, - dioxo cyclopentyl) propionitrile, that one subjects to the action of an agent of cetalisation, then one saponifies the DLL--Cl'-R 2 ' - X -oxo cyclopentyl) propionitrile formed by an alkaline agent extremely, obtains acid DLL-3 (l1-R 2, - X -oxo cyclopentyl) propionic (V), and continues the synthesis like above. In a general way, the present invention also aims, as alternatives of the process, the use as matter starting of a compound which can be obtained like product inter médiaire at any stage of the process, and the realization of the remaining stages of the process, the gonapentaenes obtained by the process of the invention can be transformed easily into others derived steroids equipped with interesting pharmacological properties such as the 19-nortestostérone or the 13P-éthyl 18,19-dinor testosterone. It is obvious for the expert that, according to the selected base optically active for the unfolding of the racemic acid of formula V, either one, or the other of both épimères possible is also insulated preferentially, which makes it possible to succeed, if desired, not only with the steroids of the natural series, but with their antipodean. Moreover, and in alternative of the process of the invention, it R > 916158 is necessary to note that during the execution of this process, the product réactiormel formed by condensation d.e the lactone of the acid 3_ (1 “_r 2 ' - X 5 ' - hydroxy 4 ' - cydopentényl) propionic with a halogéiiure of 3~Ei-méthoxy phenyl propylmagnésium, can be trans. formed, in vin.seul stage, 3-méthoxy 13-R 17-oxo gona-l, 3,5 (10). 8,14-pentaene by action of an agent of cyclization.
