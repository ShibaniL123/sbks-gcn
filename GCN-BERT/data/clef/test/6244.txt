BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Siloxane monomers, polymers, and elastomers embrace a unique combination of properties such as excellent high temperature and weather stability, extreme low temperature flexibility, high compressibility, high electrical resistivity, low dielectric loss, high gas permeability, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic etc. Because of these unique properties, silicones are widely used in industrial and consumer product applications. Specifically, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) offer some compelling properties to the personal care market place. These cyclosiloxanes along with some other low molecular weight linear siloxanes offer superior wetting properties combined with excellent volatility profile that make them highly attractive in the delivery of a variety of personal care products ranging from antiperspirants to shampoo to skin lotions.

Generalisation" by R Calas et al. Formulators of personal care products continually seek new compounds for incorporation into consumer products. Thus, a need exists to identify new cyclic siloxanes as alternatives to D4 or D5, yet having similar physical properties. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have discovered certain cyclic siloxanes which are chemically differentiated from octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane(D5), yet having similar physical properties.

The present cyclic siloxanes have similar physical properties as octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane(D4) and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (Ds). Therefore, they are useful in a variety of personal care compositions. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 : Sensory Test Results for the Cyclic Siloxane of Example 2 Compared to D5 Figure 2: Sensory Test Results for the Cyclic Siloxane of Example 3 Compared to D5 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates generally to cyclic siloxane compounds comprising the structural formula where a ≥ 2 and b ≥ 2, R is an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alternatively R is methyl.R1 is independently hydrogen or methyl. In the above formula [R2SiO] represents a dialkylsiloxy unit. There are at least two dialkylsiloxy units in the cyclic siloxanes of the formula above, as indicated by the subscript "a" having a value of ≥2, alternatively a may range from 2 to 8, alternatively from 2 to 6, alternatively from 2 to 4, or alternatively 2 to 3. In the above formula (CR12) represents an alkylene or oxyalkylene group. The alkylene group contains at least two carbon atoms, as indicated by the subscript b. R1 in the formula may be a hydrogen atom or a methyl group. Thus, the (CR12)b segment may be for example selected from the following alkylene groups; -CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2-, -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, -CH(CH3)CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2C(CH3)2-, -C(CH3)2CH2C(CH3)2-, - CH2CH2CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, -CH2CH2CH2C(CH3)2-, -CH(CH3)CH2C(CH3)2-, or - C(CH3)2CH2C(CH3)2-. Alternatively, the (CR12)b segment is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2-, or - CH(CH3)CH2C(CH3)2-, -CH2CH2-O-CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2-O-CH2CH2CH2-. According to an embodiment of the invention, the cyclic siloxane is 2,2,4,4,6,6,8-heptamethyl-1,3,5-trioxa-2,4-disilacyclooctane having the formula; According to an embodiment of the invention, the cyclic siloxane is 2,2,4,4,6,6,8-heptamethyl-1,3,5,7-tetraoxa-2,4,6-trisilacyclodecane having the formula; According to an embodiment of the invention, the cyclic siloxane is 2,2,4,4,6-pentamethyl-1,3,5-trioxa-2,4-disilacyclooctane having the formula; Also described in this disclosure is a, cyclic siloxane, 1,2,2,4,4,6-pentamethyl-1,3,5-trioxa-2,4-disilacycloheptane, having the formula The cyclic siloxanes may be prepared by various methods. Alternatively, the cyclic siloxanes may be prepared according to the process as described herein. The present invention provides a process for preparing the cyclic siloxanes of the embodiments of the invention disclosed above, by reacting a chloro endblocked polydialkylsiloxane, alternatively a polydimethylsiloxane, with a diol functional compound containing at least 2 carbon atoms. Chloro endblocked polydimethylsiloxanes are known and maybe represented by the following average formula; n is typically 1 or 2. They may be prepared as illustrated below; The diol functional compound containing at least two carbon atoms may be selected from those organic compounds containing at least two hydroxy functional groups. Typically, the diol functional compound is a diol functional hydrocarbon containing at least 3 carbon atoms, alternatively at least 4 carbon atoms, alternatively at least 5 carbon atoms, or alternatively at least 6 carbon atoms. Representative, non-limiting examples include; 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanedioll,3-butanediol,hexylene glycol, 1,2-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 2,3-butanediol, 1,2-pentanediol, 1,4-pentanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 2,4-pentanediol, 1,2-hexanediol, 1,5-hexanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 2,5-hexanediol, 1,3-cyclohexanediol, 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol,2,6-heptanediol,1,2-cyclopentanediol,2-methyl-2,3-butanediol,diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,2 hexanediol, 3,3-dimethyl-1,2-butanediol, 4-methyl-2,3- pentanediol,2,4-dimethyl-2,4-pentanediol,cyclopentane-1,3-diyldimethanol,3-fluoro-1,2- propanediol. The reaction between the chloro endblocked polydimethylsiloxane and the diol functional compound may be neat or in a solvent. Typically, the reaction is conducted in a solvent, where the solvent is selected from an aprotic polar organic solvent. Exemplary aprotic organic solvents include low molecular weight organic esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate, isopropyl acetate, propyl acetate, ethyl fluoroacetate, butyl acetate, propyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, isobutyl acetate, ethyl isobutyrate, sec-butyl acetate, and other solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, acetone, methylisobutyl ketone, 2- methyltetrahydrofuran, 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran, 2-butoxyethyl acetate. The reaction between the chloro endblocked polydimethylsiloxane and the diol functional compound is typically enhanced by the addition of an organic amine compound. The added amine reacts with hydrogen chloride ion formed in the reaction to form an amine salt, which may be filtered or easily separated from the cyclic siloxane product. Exemplary amines include; hexyl amine, pyridine, diethylamine, diethylmethylamine, ethylisopropylamine, dipropylamine, ethylbutylamine, diisopropylamine, dibutylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, N,N-dimethylbutylamine, n-methyldipropylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, triisobutylamine, tripentylamine, n,n-dibutyl-n-methylamine, 1-methylpyrrolidine, 1-butylpyrrolidine, 2-methylpyridine, 3-methylpyridine, 4- methylpyridine, pyrrolidone, 2-methylpyrrolidine, 2,5-dimethylpyrrolidine. The order of addition in the reaction may vary, but typically the chloro endblocked polydimethylsiloxane and diol functional compound are added simultaneously to the reaction solvent medium. Typically, the rates of each are adjusted to be approximately the same, and both are added at such a rate so as the addition was completed in about 1 hour. The reaction is conducted at a temperature of 0 to 200 °C, alternatively from 30 to 120°C, or alternatively from 50 to 80°C, at atmospheric conditions. The amounts of the chloro endblocked polydimethylsiloxane and diol functional compound used in the reaction may vary, but typically the reaction is conducted at approximately a 1 : 1 mole ratio of each reactant. Alternatively, the reaction is conducted with a slight excess, such as a 10% molar excess, of the diol compound, to ensure complete consumption of the chloro endblocked polydimethylsiloxane. The cyclic siloxane may be isolated and/or purified by using common distillation techniques. Alternatively, although not according to the invention, instead of using chloro endblocked polydimethylsiloxane to react with the diol functional compound, the chloro group may be replaced with other groups that react in a condensation reaction. Such groups include acetoxy, oxime, silanol, and silazane groups. Alternatively, although not according to the invention, the cyclic siloxanes discussed in the present disclosure may be prepared by a condensation reaction, as illustratedbelow. The cyclic siloxanes may be combined with other silicone compositions. For example, such silicones include; silicone fluids, gums, resins, elastomers, silicone surfactants and emulsifiers such as silicone polyethers, organofunctional silicones such as aminofunctional silicones and alkylmethylsiloxanes. Alkylmethylsiloxanes maybe combined with the present cyclic siloxanes. The alkylmethylsiloxanes siloxane polymers generally will have the formula Me3SiO[Me2SiO]y[MeRSiO]zSiMe3, in which R is a hydrocarbon group containing 6-30 carbon atoms, Me represents methyl, and the degree of polymerization (DP), i.e., the sum of y and z is 3-50. Both the volatile and liquid species of alkymethysiloxanes can be used in the composition. Silicone gums may be combined with the present cyclic siloxanes. As used herein, silicone gums refer to polydiorganosiloxane gums. Silicone gums are known in the art and are available commercially. They consist of generally insoluble polydiorganosiloxanes having a viscosity in excess of 1,000,000 centistoke [mm2/s]) at 25 °C, alternatively greater than 5,000,000 centistoke (mm2/s) at 25 °C. These silicone gums are typically sold as compositions already dispersed in a suitable solvent to facilitate their handling. Ultra-high viscosity silicones can also be included as optional ingredients. These ultra-high viscosity silicones typically have a kinematic viscosity greater than 5 million centistoke (mm2/s) at 25 °C, to 20 million centistoke (mm2/s) at 25°C. Silicone resins may be combined with the present cyclic siloxanes. These resin compositions are generally highly crosslinked polymeric siloxanes. Crosslinking is obtained by incorporating trifunctional and/or tetrafunctional silanes with the monofunctional silane and/or difunctional silane monomers used during manufacture. The degree of crosslinking required to obtain a suitable silicone resin will vary according to the specifics of the silane monomer units incorporated during manufacture of the silicone resin. In general, any silicone having a sufficient level of trifunctional and tetrafunctional siloxane monomer units, and hence possessing sufficient levels of crosslinking to dry down to a rigid or a hard film can be considered to be suitable for use as the silicone resin. Commercially available silicone resins suitable for applications herein are generally supplied in an unhardened form in low viscosity volatile or nonvolatile silicone fluids. The silicone resins should be incorporated into compositions of the invention in their non-hardened forms rather than as hardened resinous structures. Water soluble or water dispersible silicone polyether compositions may be included in compositions containing the present cyclic siloxanes. Silicone polyethers are also known as polyalkylene oxide silicone copolymers, silicone poly(oxyalkylene) copolymers, silicone glycol copolymers, or silicone surfactants. These can be linear rake or graft type materials, or ABA type where the B is the siloxane polymer block, and the A is the poly(oxyalkylene) group. The poly(oxyalkylene) group can consist of polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, or mixed polyethylene oxide/polypropylene oxide groups. Other oxides, such as butylene oxide or phenylene oxide are also possible. The present cyclic siloxanes may be incorporated into the oil phase of o/w, w/o, w/s, or multiple phase emulsions using organic or silicone emulsifiers. As used herein, "emulsifier" refers to any compound or substance that enables the formation of an emulsion. The emulsifier may be selected from any ionic, nonionic, or zwitterionic surfactant capable of stabilizing emulsions. The surfactant may be an anionic surfactant, cationic surfactant, nonionic surfactant, amphoteric surfactant, or a mixture of surfactants. Representative examples of suitable anionic surfactants include alkali metal soaps of higher fatty acids, alkylaryl sulphonates such as sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate, long chain fatty alcohol sulphates, olefin sulphates and olefin sulphonates, sulphated monoglycerides, sulphated esters, sulphonated ethoxylated alcohols, sulphosuccinates, alkane sulphonates, phosphate esters, alkyl isethionates, alkyl taurates, and alkyl sarcosinates. One example of a preferred anionic surfactant is sold commercially under the name Bio-Soft N-300. It is a triethanolamine linear alkylate sulphonate composition marketed by the Stephan Company, Northfield, Illinois. Representative examples of suitable cationic surfactants include alkylamine salts, quaternary ammonium salts, sulphonium salts, and phosphonium salts. Representative examples of suitable nonionic surfactants include condensates of ethylene oxide with long chain fatty alcohols or fatty acids such as a C12-16 alcohol, condensates of ethylene oxide with an amine or an amide, condensation products of ethylene and propylene oxide, esters of glycerol, sucrose, sorbitol, fatty acid alkylol amides, sucrose esters, fluoro-surfactants, and fatty amine oxides. Representative examples of suitable amphoteric surfactants include imidazoline compounds, alkylaminoacid salts, and betaines. Representative examples of suitable commercially available nonionic surfactants include polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols sold under the tradename BRIJ by Uniqema (ICI Surfactants), Wilmington, Delaware. Some examples are BRIJ 35 Liquid, an ethoxylated alcohol known as polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether, and BRIJ 30, another ethoxylated alcohol known as polyoxyethylene (4) lauryl ether. Some additional nonionic surfactants include ethoxylated alcohols sold under the trademark TERGITOL® by The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan. Some example are TERGITOL® TMN-6, an ethoxylated alcohol known as ethoxylated trimethylnonanol; and various of the ethoxylated alcohols, i.e., C12-C14 secondary alcohol ethoxylates, sold under the trademarks TERGITOL® 15-S-5, TERGITOL® 15-S-12, TERGITOL® 15-S- 15, and TERGITOL® 15-S-40. When mixtures containing nonionic surfactants are used, one nonionic surfactant should have a low Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance (HLB) and the other nonionic surfactant should have a high HLB, such that the two nonionic surfactants have a combined HLB of 11 -15, alternatively a combined HLB of 12.5-14.5. The emulsifier may also be chosen to from a water/oil or a water/silicone emulsifier, such as silicone polyether emulsifers. Silicone polyethers (SPEs) generally refer to silicones containing polyether or polyoxyalkylene groups, which could take in many different structural forms. Typically such forms are either rake-type or ABA type SPEs which are derived most commonly from hydrosilylation of SiH functional organosiloxanes with allyloxy-functional polyethers in the presence of a Pt catalyst The silicone polyethers disclosed in US 4,122,029 may be selected as the emulsifier for its teaching of polydiorganosiloxanepolyoxyalkylene block copolymers containing at least one polydiorganosiloxane block and at least one polyoxyalkylene block. The silicone polyethers disclosed in US 4,853,474 maybe selected as the emulsifier for its teaching of organopolysiloxane-polyoxyalkylene emulsifiers for polar in nonpolar liquid emulsions wherein the organopolysiloxane-polyoxyalkylene polymer molecules are intentionally cross linked through a cross linking agent joined thereto by non-hydrolyzable bonds and being free of internal hydrolyzable bonds. Silicone polyether elastomers such as those disclosed in US 5811487 may be selected as the emulsifier for its teaching of elastomeric silicone polyethers useful as emulsifiers. The emulsifier may also be a combination or mixture of various emulsifiers, for example any of those described above. The emulsifier may also include the addition of auxiliary surfactants. Furthermore, the emulsifier or mixture of emulsifiers may be used neat, or the emulsifier may be dissolved in a hydrophobic solvent, such as a volatile silicone, including the present cyclic siloxanes. Illustrative, non-limiting commercial products suitable as the emulsifiers include; DC5225C, DC3225C, DC5200, DC9011, DC9040, DC9050 DC8822A, (Dow Corning Corp., Midland, MI 48686) Other additives can also be incorporated in the emulsion, such as fillers, foam control agents; anti-freeze agents and biocides. The emulsion may contain a buffering agent, such as citric acid. The cyclic siloxanes, or compositions containing the present cyclic siloxanes such as the aforementioned silicone compositions, can be used in various over-the-counter (OTC) personal care products, medical care, and household care products. Thus, they can be used in antiperspirants, deodorants, skin creams, skin care lotions, moisturizers, facial treatments such as acne or wrinkle removers, personal and facial cleansers, bath oils, perfumes, colognes, sachets, sunscreens, pre-shave and after-shave lotions, liquid soaps, shower gels, shaving soaps, shaving lathers, hair shampoos, hair conditioners, hair sprays, mousses, permanents, depilatories, cuticle coats, make-ups, color cosmetics, foundations, blushes, lipsticks, lip balms, eyeliners, mascaras, oil removers, color cosmetic removers, and powders. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the cyclic siloxanes of the present invention can be combined with various other components to prepare the personal care products. These components include additional surfactants, moisturizers, pigments, sunscreens, fragrances, emollients, commonly used to formulate such personal care products.

Table IX: Emulsion HeatAging and Freeze/Thaw StabilityVolatile SiloxaneHeat Aged at 45 °CFreeze/Thaw(1 month)(5 cycles)D5IntactIntactExample 2IntactIntact Silicone Gum Blends When blended with polydimethylsiloxane gum (Dow Corning SGM-36), Example 2 and Example 3 cyclics demonstrated smaller changes in viscosity relative to solvents such as 3 cSt DC 200 fluid and organic solvents such as IHD. A typical gum blend was prepared by blending 2.01 g of the high molecular weight polydimethylsiloxane (Dow Corning SGM-36) with 8.01 g of Example 2 or Example 3 in a dental mixer until smooth. Viscosity measured by using a Brookfield cone-plate Rheometer (Model DV-III) at 25 °C.
