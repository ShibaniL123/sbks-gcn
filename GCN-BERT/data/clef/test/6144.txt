TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a therapeutic agent for a keratoconjunctive disorder containing a RARγ agonist as an effective ingredient. BACKGROUND ART The cornea is a transparent avascular tissue with a diameter of about 1 cm, covering the front surface of an eye ball. The conjunctiva is a mucous membrane covering the back surface of the eye lid and the surface of an eye ball which is posterior to the corneal limbus. The cornea and the conjunctiva serve an important role in vision. It is known that visual function is seriously affected when a disorder occurs therein. Keratoconjunctive disorders induced by various diseases such as corneal ulcer, keratitis, and dry eye are disorders caused by a delay in recovery from a disorder due to some reason such as an external injury or by a disorder that has become chronic. Since the cornea is a tissue that is connected to the conjunctiva, such diseases negatively affect each other in the normal construction of the epithelium and in some cases harm the structure or functioning of the corneal stroma or endothelium. Collagen (especially type I collagen) is known as one of the representative stromal components of corneal parenchymal tissue. A functional disorder resulting from stromal degradation occurs in diseases due to a keratoconjunctive disorder. Thus, suppression of degradation of collagen (especially type I collagen) is considered effective against diseases caused by a keratoconjunctive disorder. In a keratoconjunctive disorder, scar tissue, which is often formed after an inflammation has calmed, may obstruct the visual function. For this reason, suppression of collagen contraction, if possible, is considered effective against contraction and formation of scars (hereinafter, referred together as “scar formation”) as in the above-described suppression of collagen degradation. Patent Literature 1 describes that all-trans retinoic acid (hereinafter, also referred to as ATRA) promotes corneal regeneration. However, the effect thereof is weak and the detailed mechanism thereof is yet to be elucidated. Further, ATRA is an agonist of retinoic acid receptors (hereinafter, also referred to as RAR). However, since ATRA does not have selectivity with respect to RAR subtypes RARα, RARβ, and RARγ, the contribution of each RAR subtype to corneal regeneration effects is unknown. Meanwhile, RAR is involved in various effects such as growth, morphogenesis and differentiation in many cells, such as inflammatory cells, immune cells, and structural cells. Further, it is verified that there is a difference in the distribution of RAR subtypes depending on the tissue or organ of a mammal. Some of the effects of RAR are undesirable, such as increase in triglyceride due to RARα. Thus, the specificity or selectivity with respect to subtypes in compounds with RAR agonist activity is expected to lead to reduction in risk of side effects. For the above reasons, there is a demand for RAR agonists, which have a strong effect of suppressing keratoconjunctive disorders and are highly safe based on subtype selectivity. Patent Literatures 2 and 3 disclose the RAR agonist (E)-4-(2-{3-[(1H-pyrazole-1-yl)methyl]-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalene-2-yl}vin yl)benzoic acid and the derivatives thereof. Further, Patent Literature 2 describes that (E)-4-(2-{3-[(1H-pyrazole-1-yl)methyl]-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalene-2-yl}vin yl)benzoic acid is useful against pulmonary emphysema, cancer, and dermatosis. Patent Literature 3 describes that the above-described agonist is useful against neurological pain. In addition, Non-Patent Literature 1 describes that the RAR agonist 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene acid induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, Patent Literature 4 describes that the RAR agonist 3-fluoro-4-[2-hydroxy-2-(5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7, 8-tetrahydronaphthalene-2-yl)acetylamino]benzoic acid is useful in muscle repair or regeneration. However, pharmacological effects on keratoconjunctive disorders or scar formation resulting from keratoconjunctive disorders are not discussed or reported for any of the RAR agonists. In addition, there is no literature that suggests such an effect.

Example 1 Test Example Test on Suppression of Three-Dimensional Collagen Gel Degradation in Normal Rabbit Primary Keratocytes by RARγ Agonist A Normal rabbit corneal cells were used to assess the suppression effect of a tested compound on three-dimensional collagen gel degradation in accordance with the method of Nishida et al (Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science 42: 1247-1253 (2001)). Primary keratocytes collected from a normal rabbit eye ball was grown to a confluent state and detached from a culture slide with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. After washing in a serum free medium (product number 11095; Gibco), the number of cells were counted. The obtained primary keratocytes were mixed with the type I collagen solution Cellmatrix Type I-A (product number 637-00653; Nitta Gelatin Inc.) and Reconstitution Buffer (product number 635-00791; Nitta Gelatin Inc.) and dispensed into a 24-well plate so that the final concentration would be 1×105 cells/well to make a collagen gel. After making the gel, culture was started (under conditions of 37° C. and 5% CO2) by adding to a MEM medium a RARγ agonist A (R667)-containing dimethyl sulfoxide solution (R667 concentration: 0.1 nM, 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, or 1000 nM) or a RARγ agonist-free dimethyl sulfoxide solution as a control and 10 ng (final concentration 10 ng/ml) of IL-1β (product number 201-LB-005; R&D Systems) and 60 μg (final concentration 60 μg/ml) of Plasminogen (product number P9156; Sigma) as a stimulant, and overlaying the medium on the previously prepared collagen gel. After 48 hours of culturing, the supernatant was ultrafiltrated, 100 μl of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added and heated, and the collagen was hydrolyzed. The reaction solution after the hydrolysis was dried under a nitrogen gas atmosphere by using a Dry Thermo Unit (DTU-2C, Taitec Co. Ltd.) and an evaporation head (E1-20 Taitec Co. Ltd.) and then dissolved in 500 μl of ultrapure water. The amount of hydroxyproline, which is the collagen degradation product in the solution, was measured in accordance with the method of Bergman et al (Analytical Chemistry 35(12): 1961-1965 (1963)) to assess the effect of suppressing collagen degradation of RARγ agonist A. The results are shown in FIG. 1. In the present test, RARγ agonist A exhibited a dosage-dependent effect of suppressing keratoconjunctive collagen degradation. Formulation Example (Drug Formulation Example 1) Instillation In 100 ml RARγ agonist A 100 mg Sodium chloride 800 mg Polysorbate 80 appropriate amount Disodium hydrogen phosphate appropriate amount Sodium dihydrogen phosphate appropriate amount Sterile purified water appropriate amount RARγ agonist A and the other components described above are added to sterile purified water. The solution is thoroughly mixed to prepare an instillation. It is possible to prepare an instillation with a concentration of 0.05% (W/V), 0.3% (W/V), 0.5% (W/V), or 1% (W/V) by changing the amount of RARγ agonist A or the like that is added. (Drug Formulation Example 2) Ophthalmic Ointment In 100 g RARγ agonist A 0.3 g Liquid paraffin 10.0 g White petrolatum appropriate amount RARγ agonist A is added to homogeneously-melted white petrolatum and liquid paraffin. The mixture is thoroughly mixed and then gradually cooled to prepare an ophthalmic ointment. It is possible to prepare an ophthalmic ointment with a concentration of 0.05% (W/W), 0.1% (W/W), 0.5% (W/W), or 1% (W/W) by changing the amount of RARγ agonist A or the like that is added. (Drug Formulation Example 3) Tablet In 100 mg RARγ agonist A 1 mg Lactose 66.4 mg Corn starch 20 mg Calcium carboxymethyl cellulose 6 mg Hydroxypropyl cellulose 6 mg Magnesium stearate 0.6 mg RARγ agonist A, corn starch and lactose are mixed in a mixer. Calcium carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose are added to the mixture for granulation. The particle size of the resulting granules is adjusted after drying. Magnesium stearate is added to and mixed with the adjusted granules and the mixture is made into tablets with a tableting machine. Further, it is possible to prepare tablets with the content of 0.1 mg, 10 mg, or 50 mg in 100 mg by changing the amount of RARγ agonist A or the like that is added. Example 2 Test Example Test on Suppression of Three-Dimensional Collagen Gel Contraction in Various Primary Cells Derived from Normal Rabbits by RARγ Agonist A Primary subconjunctival fibroblasts and primary keratocytes were used to assess the suppression effect of a tested compound on three-dimensional collagen gel contraction in accordance with the method of Nishida et al. As in Example 1, primary subconjunctival fibroblasts were grown and detached from a culture slide. After washing, a cell suspension was made. The resulting suspension (1.1×107 cells/well MEM), type I collagen solution (5 mg/ml), 10×MEM, Reconstitution Buffer, and water were mixed on ice at 0.2:7:1:1:1.8 (volume ratio). A culture dish coated with 1% BSA was inoculated with 0.5 ml of the mixture, which was incubated for one hour at 37° C. to make a collagen gel. Then, 0.5 ml of serum free media, to which a certain amount (1 ng/ml) of TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) and RARγ agonist A at each of the concentrations 1 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM were added, were each added onto the above-described gel. The gel, together with a gel to which an agent-free serum-free medium was added, was continuously incubated at 37° C. The diameter of gels was measured from the time when 24 hours has past. The results of measuring the diameters of the gels after 48 hours are shown in FIG. 2. The gel diameter was measured for primary keratocytes in a similar manner to the primary subconjunctival fibroblasts. The results are shown in FIG. 3. It can be seen from FIGS. 2 and 3 that RARγ agonist A not only can suppress collagen degradation, but also collagen gel contraction due to TGF using subconjunctival fibroblasts or keratocytes. This demonstrates that RARγ agonist A contributes to collagen turn over and has an effect of suppressing tissue remodeling that occurs after inflammation, hemorrhage, infection, surgery, or injury in an ophthalmic tissue, i.e., fibrillation or cicatrization. Example 3 Test Example Test on Suppression of Three-Dimensional Collagen Gel Degradation in Primary Keratocytes Derived from Normal Rabbits by RARγ Agonist A, B, or C Primary keratocytes were used to assess the suppression effect of a tested compound on three-dimensional collagen gel degradation by the same method as in Example 1 in accordance with the method of Nishida et al. As in Example 1, primary keratocytes were grown and detached from a culture slide. After washing, a cell suspension was made. The resulting suspension (1.1×107 cells/well MEM), type I collagen solution (5 mg/ml), 10×MEM, Reconstitution Buffer, and water were mixed on ice at 0.2:7:1:1:1.8 (volume ratio). A culture dish coated with 1% BSA was inoculated with 0.5 ml of the mixture, which was incubated for one hour at 37° C. to make a collagen gel. After making the gel, culture was started (under conditions of 37° C. and 5% CO2) by adding to a MEM medium a RARγ agonist A (R667)-containing dimethyl sulfoxide solution (1 nM), RARγ agonist B (CD437)-containing dimethyl sulfoxide solution (1 nM, 10 nM), RARγ agonist C (BMS961)-containing dimethyl sulfoxide solution (10 nM), or a RARγ agonist-free dimethyl sulfoxide solution as a control, and 10 ng (final concentration 10 ng/ml) of IL-1β (product number 201-LB-005; R&D Systems) and 60 μg (final concentration 60 μg/ml) of Plasminogen (product number P9156, Sigma Aldrich) as a stimulant, and overlaying the medium on the previously prepared collagen gel. After 48 hours of culturing, collagen was hydrolyzed and the amount of hydroxyproline, which is the collagen degradation product, was measured by the same method as Example 1 to assess the effect of suppressing collagen degradation of each RARγ agonist. The results are shown in FIG. 4. In the present test, not only RARγ agonist A, but also RARγ agonists B and C exhibited an effect of suppressing keratoconjunctive collagen degradation. Example 4 Test Example Test on Suppression of the Expression and Activation of MMP-1, 2, 3, and 9 by RARγ Agonist A It is believed that secretion or expression of protease, i.e., matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), is associated with the degradation of type I collagen. In this regard, suppression of expression and activation of MMP-1, 2, 3, and 9 by RARγ agonist A was investigated. Primary keratocytes collected from a normal rabbit eye ball were cultured for 24 hours in a serum-free MEM medium. RARγ agonist A (R667) (R667 concentration: 1×10−6 μM, 1×10−5 μM, 1×10−4 μM, 1×10−3 μM, 1×10−2 μM) was added to the obtained culture solution and 12 hours of pre-treatment was performed. As a positive control, 10 nM of dexamethasone (Dex), which is a synthetic steroid, was added and pre-treatment was similarly performed. Then, IL-113 (0.1 ng/ml) was added for stimulation, and the supernatant was collected after 24 hours. The following western blot analysis and gelatin zymography analysis were used on the collected culture solution. (Western Blot Analysis) After developing the supernatant of the collected culture solution in SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gel, the separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter. Then, non-specific sites on the nitrocellulose filter were blocked and incubated for 24 hours at 4° C. with anti-human MMP-1 antibodies (R&D Systems) and anti-rabbit MMP-3 antibodies (Daiichi Fine Chemical Co., Ltd). ECL® reagent (GE Healthcare) was used for detection. The results are shown in FIG. 4A. The band for each of the non-active Pro-MMP-1, Pro-MMP-3 and active MMP-1, MMP-3 was diminished, where the extent thereof was dependent on the concentration of RARγ agonist A. Thus, it was revealed that RARγ agonist A concentration-dependently suppresses the expression and activation of MMP-1 and MMP-3. (Gelatin Zymography Analysis) After developing the supernatant of the collected culture solution on SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% of gelatin, it was incubated for one hour at room temperature with a TBS solution containing 2.5% Triton X-100. The gel after incubation was dyed with a solution of Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and decolored with a 5% methanol-7.5% acetic acid solution (Nacalai Tesque, Inc). The results are shown in FIG. 4B. The band for each of the non-active Pro-MMP-2, Pro-MMP-9 and active MMP-2, MMP-9 was diminished, where the extent thereof was dependent on the concentration of RARγ agonist A. Thus, it was revealed that RARγ agonist A concentration-dependently suppresses the expression and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Example 5 Test Example Test on Suppression of Corneal Opacity and Ulceration with RARγ Agonist A Systemic anesthesia was applied to male Japanese white rabbits (body weight 2.5-3.5 kg, 27 rabbits) by intramuscular administration of a solution of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine. Then, topical anesthesia was applied by a 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride instillation. Furthermore, 30 μl of 1% LPS (Sigma Aldrich) was injected into the corneal stroma of one eye, but not in the other eye. 50 μl of 0.1% PBS/0.1% polysorbate 80 solution containing RARγ agonist A (R667: 0.1%, 24 mM) was instillatively administered to the rabbits injected with LPS twice after the injection on the day of LPS injection and four times daily thereafter until day 10 by using a micropipette. As a control, a 0.1% PBS/0.1% polysorbate 80 solution free of RARγ agonist A (Vehicle) was similarly administered. FIG. 5 shows representative examples of a control and a case where RARγ agonist A was administered. In FIG. 5, corneal opacity and ulceration were observed in the control (Vehicle) shown in the top row. However, in a case where RARγ agonist A was administered (0.1% R667) shown in the bottom row, corneal opacity and ulceration were not observed. Thus, it was revealed that RARγ agonist A suppresses corneal opacity and ulceration. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY RARγ agonists, which are effective ingredients of the therapeutic agent for a keratoconjunctive disorder of the present invention, are useful in preventing or as a therapeutic agent for keratoconjunctive disorders, such as corneal ulcer, corneal epithelial abrasion, keratitis, dry eye, conjunctivitis, chronic superficial keratitis, corneal erosion, persistent corneal disorders, superficial punctate keratopathy, corneal epithelial defects, conjunctival epithelial defects, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, filamentary keratoconjunctivitis, infectious keratitis, noninfectious keratitis, infectious conjunctivitis and noninfectious conjunctivitis, by strongly suppressing collagen degradation.
