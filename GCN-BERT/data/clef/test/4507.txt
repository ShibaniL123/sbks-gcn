Example 373A
1-[2-(Cyclopentyloxy)ethyl]-3-ethyl-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbaldehyde
933 mg (6.75 mmol) of potassium carbonate were added to a solution of 650 mg (2.7 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 48A in 24 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 15 min. Then 1.66 g (8.2 mmol) of (2-bromoethoxy)cyclopentane were added, and the mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 20 h. The DMF was then very substantially distilled off and the remaining residue was partitioned between semisaturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (70 ml) and ethyl acetate (70 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The residue obtained was chromatographed using a silica gel cartridge (Biotage, 100 g of silica gel, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate). 646 mg (68% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
