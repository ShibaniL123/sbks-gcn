(3) 2,2-bis(diisopropyloxyphosphoryl)2-fluoroethylmethanesulfonate
To tetraisopropyl-1-fluoro-3-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (190 mg, 0.47 mmol) dissolved in 5 mL of dichloromethane were added triethylamine (78 μL, 0.56 mmol) and methanesulfonyl chloride (43 μL, 0.56 mmol) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for 7 hr, and extracted with ethyl acetate (2×50 mL). The obtained organic phase was washed with water. Then, it was washed with salt water, dehydrated over magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by silica gel column (solvent: acetone/n-hexane=1/1) to give 2,2-bis(diisopropyloxyphosphoryl)2-fluoroethylmethanesulfonate (209 mg, yield 92%) as a yellow oil.
