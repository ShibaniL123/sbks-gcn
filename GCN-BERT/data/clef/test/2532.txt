TOPICAL NANOEMULSION THERAPY FOR WOUNDS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to therapeutic nanoemulsion compositions and to methods of utilizing the same to treat a wound (e.g., a burn wound). In particular, nanoemulsion compositions are described herein that find use in reducing and/or preventing progression/conversion of a partial thickness burn wound (e.g., to deep partial thickness wound or a full thickness burn wound (e.g., by accelerating and/or improving burn wound healing)). Compositions and methods of the present invention find use in, among other things, clinical (e.g. therapeutic and preventative medicine), industrial, and research applications. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Contemporary burn wound management involves early debridement and reconstruction of non- viable skin coupled with provision of supportive care and topical antimicrobial dressing changes to partial thickness burn wounds. The goal of modern burn wound care is to provide an optimal environment for epidermal renewal. Restoration of skin integrity takes place via regrowth of keratinocytes from preserved hair follicles or transfer of split thickness skin grafts harvested from non-burn regions. During the period of epidermal renewal it is important to avoid further injury to the skin, abrogate burn wound progression, and minimize secondary complications such as wound infection. Early excision of full-thickness burn eschar, immediate skin grafting, and treatment of remaining open or partial thickness areas of burn wound with topical antimicrobial agents has heretofore been the most effective way of minimizing burn wound colonization and invasive wound infection.(See, e.g., Bessey, Wound care. In Herndon DN, ed: Total Burn Care 3rd edition. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier Inc., 2007, pp 127-135.). Popular topical antimicrobial agents include silver sulfadiazine (SILVADENE), mafenide acetate (SULFAMYLON), and colloidal silver impregnated dressings (ACTICOAT, SILVERLON). Each of these agents has potential limitations such as variable ability to penetrate eschar, uneven efficacy against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and potential toxicity to host immune cells (See, e.g., Steinstraesser et al, Antimicrob Agents Chemother 46(6): 1837- 1844, 2002). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to therapeutic nanoemulsion compositions and to methods of utilizing the same to treat a burn wound. In particular, nanoemulsion compositions are described herein that find use in reducing and/or preventing progression/conversion of a partial thickness burn wound (e.g., to deep partial thickness wound or a full thickness burn wound (e.g., by accelerating and/or improving burn wound healing)). Compositions and methods of the present invention find use in, among other things, clinical (e.g. therapeutic and preventative medicine), industrial, and research applications. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the invention provides compositions and methods for treating burn wounds. For example, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a burn wound comprising providing a subject harboring a burn wound; and a composition comprising a nanoemulsion described herein; and administering the composition comprising a nanoemulsion to the burn wound, wherein the administering treats the burn wound (e.g., prevents the progression and/or convervsion of a partial thickness burn wound to a deep partial thickness burn wound or to a full thickness burn wound). A variety of nanoemulsions that find use in the methods of the invention are described herein. The invention is not limited by the amount of nanoemulsion utilized, the frequency of administration and/or the duration of administration. Indeed, therapeutically effective amounts of a nanoemulsion are described herein. In some embodiments, administration of a nanoemulsion to a burn wound inhibits the expression of IL-Ιβ at the burn wound site. In further embodiments, administration of the nanoemulsion inhibits bacterial growth at the burn wound site. In preferred embodiments, administration of the nanoemulsion inhibits ischemic necrosis. In other preferred embodiments, administration of the nanoemulsion inhibits protein denaturation. The invention also provides a method of increasing skin regeneration within a burn wound (e.g., a superficial burn wound, a partial thickness burn wound, a deep partial thickness burn wound) comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a nanoemulsion to the burn wound. In some embodiments, administering the nanoemulsion to the burn wound preserves epithelial cells that line the shaft of each hair follicle within the burn wound. In further embodiments, the epithelial cells within the burn wound participate in re-epithelialization of the wound. Administration of nanoemulsion, in some embodiments, enhances proliferation of undamaged epithelial cells that line the shaft of each hair follicle within the burn wound. In further embodiments, administration of nanoemulsion suppresses neutrophil sequestration and/or activity. The invention is not limited by the amount of nanoemulsion utilized, the frequency of administration and/or the duration of administration. As described herein, administration of nanoemulsion provides therapeutic benefit to a burn wound upon application. In some embodiments, skin regeneration and wound healing takes place within minutes, hours, 1-2 days, 3-5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, or 8 weeks. In other embodiments, compositions and methods of the invention promote and/or induce skin regeneration and/or wound healing not possible (e.g., within any time frame) with conventional treatments heretofore available in the art. In some embodiments, administration of nanoemulsion reduces IL-Ιβ expression within the burn wound. In some embodiments, administering reduces, attenuates and/or prevents bacterial growth at the burn wound site. In some embodiments, administering reduces tissue edema at the burn wound site. In some embodiments, administering reduces intravascular hypovolemia at the burn wound site. The invention also provides methods of treating a burn wound comprising providing a subject harboring a burn wound; and a composition comprising a nanoemulsion; and administering a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a nanoemulsion to the burn wound to prevent ischemic necrosis and protein denaturation at the burn wound site. The invention also provides methods of treating a wound (e.g., any type of damage to the skin (e.g., dermis)) comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a nanoemulsion of the invention to the wound. In some embodiments, administration to the wound reduces the expression of one or more proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, interferon gamma, or other proinflammatory cytokine) detectable at the wound. In some embodiments, a subject harboring a wound is seen by a physician or other medical care provider for the wound. For example, embodiments of the present disclosure provide methods of determining a treatment course of action and administering a nanoemulsion composition described herein. For example, in some embodiments, subjects with a wound (e.g., burn wound or other type of skin damage) are screened and/or tested (e.g., for inflammation, infection, wound severity, and/or other characteristic) by a physician or medical care provider and the results are used to determine a treatment course of action. For example, in some embodiments, subjects identified as having one or more types of wounds (e.g., a partial thickness burn wound, a cut, an abrasion, an infection (e.g., of the skin or hair follicles)) before beginning treatment are administered a composition comprising a nanoemulsion of the invention. In some embodiments, subjects found to not have one or more types of wounds are not administered a composition comprising a nanoemulsion of the invention. In some embodiments, a subject with a wound is screened for the presence or absence of one or more types of infection of the wound (e.g., bacterial, fungal, etc.). In some embodiments, subjects found to have a wound and/or infection of the wound is administered a composition comprising a nanoemulsion of the invention. In some embodiments, tests and/or assays for the presence or absence of the wound and/or infection of the wound are repeated (e.g., before, during or after treatment with a composition comprising a nanoemulsion of the invention). In some embodiments, tests/assays are repeated daily, weekly, monthly, annually, or less often. The present invention is not limited by the type of nanoemulsion utilized for administration to a wound (e.g., a burn wound). Indeed, any nanoemulsion formulation described herein may be utilized.

DEFINITIONS To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and phrases are defined below: As used herein, the term "microorganism" refers to any species or type of microorganism, including but not limited to, bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi, protozoans, mycoplasma, prions, and parasitic organisms. The term microorganism encompasses both those organisms that are in and of themselves pathogenic to another organism (e.g., animals, including humans, and plants) and those organisms that produce agents that are pathogenic to another organism, while the organism itself is not directly pathogenic or infective to the other organism. As used herein, the term "pathogen" refers a biological agent that causes a disease state (e.g., infection, sepsis, etc.) in a host. "Pathogens" include, but are not limited to, viruses, bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, mycoplasma, prions, and parasitic organisms. The terms "bacteria" and "bacterium" refer to all prokaryotic organisms, including those within all of the phyla in the Kingdom Procaryotae. It is intended that the term encompass all microorganisms considered to be bacteria including Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Actinomyces, Streptomyces, and Rickettsia. All forms of bacteria are included within this definition including cocci, bacilli, spirochetes, spheroplasts, protoplasts, etc. Also included within this term are prokaryotic organisms that are Gram-negative or Gram-positive. "Gram- negative" and "Gram-positive" refer to staining patterns with the Gram-staining process, which is well known in the art. (See e.g., Finegold and Martin, Diagnostic Microbiology, 6th Ed., CV Mosby St. Louis, pp. 13-15 (1982)). "Gram-positive bacteria" are bacteria that retain the primary dye used in the Gram stain, causing the stained cells to generally appear dark blue to purple under the microscope. "Gram-negative bacteria" do not retain the primary dye used in the Gram stain, but are stained by the counterstain. Thus, Gram-negative bacteria generally appear red. In some embodiments, bacteria are continuously cultured. In some embodiments, bacteria are uncultured and existing in their natural environment (e.g., at the site of a wound or infection) or obtained from patient tissues (e.g., via a biopsy). Bacteria may exhibit pathological growth or proliferation. Examples of bacteria include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells of a genus of bacteria selected from the group comprising Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia, Enterobacter, Serratia, Proteus, Yersinia, Citrobacter, Edwardsiella, Providencia, Klebsiella, Hafnia, Ewingella, Kluyvera, Morganella, Planococcus, Stomatococcus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Vibrio, Aeromonas, Plessiomonas, Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Pasteurella, Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Rickettsia, Coxiella, Rochalimaea, Ehrlichia, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Aerococcus, Gemella, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Pedicoccus, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Arcanobacterium, Actinomyces, Rhodococcus, Listeria, Erysipelothrix, Gardnerella, Neisseria, Campylobacter, Arcobacter, Wolinella, Helicobacter, Achromobacter, Acinetobacter, Agrobacterium, Alcaligenes, Chryseomonas, Comamonas, Eikenella, Flavimonas, Flavobacterium, Moraxella, Oligella, Pseudomonas, Shewanella, Weeks ella, Xanthomonas, Bordetella, Franciesella, Brucella, Legionella, Afipia, Bartonella, Calymmatobacterium, Cardiobacterium, Streptobacillus, Spirillum, Peptostreptococcus, Peptococcus, Sarcinia, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, Propionibacterium, Mobiluncus, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Rothia, Clostridium, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Bilophila, Leptotrichia, Wolinella, Acidaminococcus, Megasphaera, Veilonella, Norcardia, Actinomadura, Norcardiopsis, Streptomyces, Micropolysporas, Thermoactinomycetes, Mycobacterium, Treponema, Borrelia, Leptospira, and Chlamydiae. As used herein, the terms "microorganism" and "microbe" refer to any species or type of microorganism, including but not limited to, bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, mycoplasma, and parasitic organisms. As used herein, the term "fungi" is used in reference to eukaryotic organisms such as molds and yeasts, including dimorphic fungi. As used herein the terms "disease" and "pathologic condition" are used interchangeably, unless indicated otherwise herein, to describe a deviation from the condition regarded as normal or average for members of a species or group (e.g., humans), and which is detrimental to an affected individual under conditions that are not inimical to the majority of individuals of that species or group. Such a deviation can manifest as a state, signs, and/or symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, fever, pain, blisters, boils, rash, immune suppression, inflammation, etc.) that are associated with any impairment of the normal state of a subject or of any of its organs or tissues that interrupts or modifies the performance of normal functions. A disease or pathological condition may be caused by or result from contact with a microorganism (e.g., a pathogen or other infective agent (e.g., a virus or bacteria)), may be responsive to environmental factors (e.g., malnutrition, industrial hazards, and/or climate), may be responsive to an inherent defect of the organism (e.g., genetic anomalies) or to combinations of these and other factors. As used herein, the terms "burn," "skin burn, "burn wound" and the like refer to a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by a thermal insult, chemical insult, electrical insult, friction- induced insult and/or UV radiation insult. Burns that affect only the superficial skin (epidermis) are known in the art as superficial or first-degree burns that can be characterized by clinical findings of redness, moderate pain and no blistering. When damage penetrates into some of the underlying layers (epidermis and the dermis are damaged), the burn is characterized as a partial-thickness or second-degree burn that can be characterized by clinical findings of blistering, epidermal and dermal damage and severe pain (epidermis and dermis are destroyed and there is subcutaneous tissue damage). In a full-thickness or third- degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin (dermis, deep dermis, underlying tissue and possibly fascia bone or muscle). A fourth-degree burn involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle or bone. "Respiratory" and "respiration" refer to the process by which oxygen is taken into the body and carbon dioxide is discharged, through the bodily system including the nose, throat, larynx, trachea, bronchi and lungs. "Respiratory infection" and "pulmonary infection" refer to an infection (e.g., bacterial, viral, fungal, etc.) of the respiratory tract. In humans, the respiratory tract comprises the upper respiratory tract (e.g., nose, throat or pharynx, and larynx); the airways (e.g., : voice box or larynx, windpipe or trachea, and bronchi); and the lungs (e.g., bronchi, bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli). "Respiratory disease", "pulmonary disease," "respiratory disorder", "pulmonary disorder," "respiratory condition", "pulmonary condition," "pulmonary syndrome," and "respiratory syndrome" refer to any one of several ailments that involve inflammation and affect a component of the respiratory system including especially the trachea, bronchi and lungs. Examples of such ailments include acute alveolar disease, obstructive respiratory disease (e.g., asthma; bronchitis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, referred to as COPD), upper airway disease (e.g., such as otitis media, and rhinitis/sinusitis), insterstitial lung disease, allergy, and respiratory infection (e.g., pneumonia, pneyumocystis carinii, and respiratory syncitial virus (RSV)). Specific examples of acute alveolar disease include acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). ALI is associated with conditions that either directly or indirectly injure the air sacs of the lung, the alveoli. ALI is a syndrome of inflammation and increased permeability of the lungs with an associated breakdown of the lungs' surfactant layer. The most serious manifestation of ALI is ARDS. Among the causes of ALI are complications typically associated with certain major surgeries, mechanical ventilator induced lung injury (often referred to as VILI), smoke inhalation, pneumonia, and sepsis. The term "subject" as used herein refers to organisms to be treated by the compositions of the present invention. Such organisms include animals (domesticated animal species, wild animals), and humans. As used herein, the terms "inactivating," "inactivation" and grammatical equivalents, when used in reference to a microorganism refer to the killing, elimination, neutralization and/or reducing the capacity of the microorganism to infect and/or cause a pathological response and/or disease in a host. As used herein, the term "fusigenic" is intended to refer to an emulsion that is capable of fusing with the membrane of a microbial agent (e.g., a bacterium or bacterial spore). Specific examples of fusigenic emulsions are described herein. As used herein, the term "lysogenic" refers to an emulsion (e.g., a nanoemulsion) that is capable of disrupting the membrane of a microbial agent (e.g., a virus (e.g., viral envelope) or a bacterium, bacterial spore, or bacterial biofilm). In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the presence of a lysogenic and a fusigenic agent in the same composition produces an enhanced inactivating effect compared to either agent alone. Methods and compositions using this improved antimicrobial composition are described in detail herein. The terms "nanoemulsion," "emulsion," and "water in oil emulsion" are used interchangeably herein to refer to dispersions or droplets, as well as other lipid structures that can form as a result of hydrophobic forces that drive apolar residues (e.g., long hydrocarbon chains) away from water and drive polar head groups toward water, when a water immiscible oily phase is mixed with an aqueous phase. These other lipid structures include, but are not limited to, unilamellar, paucilamellar, and multilamellar lipid vesicles, micelles, and lamellar phases. As used herein, the terms "contact," "contacted," "expose," and "exposed," when used in reference to a nanoemulsion and a live microorganism, refer to bringing one or more nanoemulsions into contact with a microorganism (e.g., a pathogen) such that the nanoemulsion kill and/or attenuate growth of the microorganism or pathogenic agent, if present. The present invention is not limited by the amount or type of nanoemulsion used for microorganism killing and/or growth attenuation. The terms "contact," "contacted," "expose," and "exposed," when used in reference to burn wound refer to bringing one or more nanoemulsions into contact with a burn wound (e.g., a superficial burn wound, a partial thickness burn wound, a deep partial thickness burn wound or a full thickness burn wound). Ratios and amounts of nanoemulsion are contemplated in the present invention including, but not limited to, those described herein (e.g., in Example 1). As used herein, "about" will be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art and will vary to some extent depending upon the context in which it is used. If there are uses of the term which are not clear to persons of ordinary skill in the art given the context in which it is used, "about" will mean up to plus or minus 10% of the particular term. The term "surfactant" refers to any molecule having both a polar head group, which energetically prefers solvation by water, and a hydrophobic tail which is not well solvated by water. The term "cationic surfactant" refers to a surfactant with a cationic head group. The term "anionic surfactant" refers to a surfactant with an anionic head group. The terms "Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance Index Number" and "HLB Index Number" refer to an index for correlating the chemical structure of surfactant molecules with their surface activity. The HLB Index Number may be calculated by a variety of empirical formulas as described by Meyers, (Meyers, Surfactant Science and Technology, VCH Publishers Inc., New York, pp. 231-245 [1992]), incorporated herein by reference. As used herein, the HLB Index Number of a surfactant is the HLB Index Number assigned to that surfactant in McCutcheon's Volume 1 : Emulsifiers and Detergents North American Edition, 1996 (incorporated herein by reference). The HLB Index Number ranges from 0 to about 70 or more for commercial surfactants. Hydrophilic surfactants with high solubility in water and solubilizing properties are at the high end of the scale, while surfactants with low solubility in water which are good solubilizers of water in oils are at the low end of the scale. As used herein the term "interaction enhancers" refers to compounds that act to enhance the interaction of an emulsion with a microorganism (e.g., with a cell wall of a bacteria (e.g., a Gram negative bacteria) or with a viral envelope. Contemplated interaction enhancers include, but are not limited to, chelating agents (e.g., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and the like) and certain biological agents (e.g., bovine serum abulmin (BSA) and the like). The terms "buffer" or "buffering agents" refer to materials which when added to a solution, cause the solution to resist changes in pH. The terms "reducing agent" and "electron donor" refer to a material that donates electrons to a second material to reduce the oxidation state of one or more of the second material's atoms. The term "monovalent salt" refers to any salt in which the metal (e.g. , Na, K, or Li) has a net 1+ charge in solution (i.e., one more proton than electron). The term "divalent salt" refers to any salt in which a metal (e.g., Mg, Ca, or Sr) has a net 2+ charge in solution. The terms "chelator" or "chelating agent" refer to any materials having more than one atom with a lone pair of electrons that are available to bond to a metal ion. The term "solution" refers to an aqueous or non-aqueous mixture. As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to the amount of a composition (e.g., a composition comprising a nanoemulsion) sufficient to effect a beneficial or desired result (e.g., to treat and/or prevent infection (e.g., through bacterial cell killing and/or prevention of bacterial cell growth). An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations, applications or dosages and is not intended to be limited to a particular formulation or administration route. As used herein, the term "adjuvant" refers to any substance that can stimulate an immune response (e.g., a mucosal immune response). Some adjuvants cause activation of a cell of the immune system (e.g., an adjuvant can cause an immune cell to produce and secrete a cytokine). Examples of adjuvants that can cause activation of a cell of the immune system include, but are not limited to, the nanoemulsion formulations described herein, saponins purified from the bark of the Q. saponaria tree, such as QS21 (a glycolipid that elutes in the 21st peak with HPLC fractionation; Aquila Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Worcester, Mass.); poly(di(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene (PCPP polymer; Virus Research Institute, USA); derivatives of lipopolysaccharides such as monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL; Ribi ImmunoChem Research, Inc., Hamilton, Mont.), muramyl dipeptide (MDP; Ribi) and threonyl-muramyl dipeptide (t-MDP; Ribi); OM-174 (a glucosamine disaccharide related to lipid A; OM Pharma SA, Meyrin, Switzerland); cholera toxin (CT), and Leishmania elongation factor (a purified Leishmania protein; Corixa Corporation, Seattle, Wash.). Traditional adjuvants are well known in the art and include, for example, aluminum phosphate or hydroxide salts ("alum"). In some embodiments, immunogenic compositions described herein are administered with one or more adjuvants (e.g., to skew the immune response towards a Thl and/or Th2 type response). As used herein, the term "an amount effective to induce an immune response" (e.g., of a composition for inducing an immune response), refers to the dosage level required (e.g., when administered to a subject) to stimulate, generate and/or elicit an immune response in the subject. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations (e.g., via the same or different route), applications or dosages and is not intended to be limited to a particular formulation or administration route. As used herein, the term "under conditions such that said subject generates an immune response" refers to any qualitative or quantitative induction, generation, and/or stimulation of an immune response (e.g., innate or acquired). As used herein, the term "immune response" refers to any detectable response by the immune system of a subject. For example, immune responses include, but are not limited to, an alteration (e.g., increase) in Toll receptor activation, lymphokine (e.g., cytokine (e.g., Thl or Th2 type cytokines) or chemokine) expression and/or secretion, macrophage activation, dendritic cell activation, T cell (e.g., CD4+ or CD8+ T cell) activation, NK cell activation, and/or B cell activation (e.g., antibody generation and/or secretion). Additional examples of immune responses include binding of an immunogen (e.g., antigen (e.g., immunogenic polypeptide)) to an MHC molecule and induction of a cytotoxic T lymphocyte ("CTL") response, induction of a B cell response (e.g., antibody production), and/or T-helper lymphocyte response, and/or a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response (e.g., against the antigen from which an immunogenic polypeptide is derived), expansion (e.g., growth of a population of cells) of cells of the immune system (e.g., T cells, B cells (e.g., of any stage of development (e.g., plasma cells), and increased processing and presentation of antigen by antigen presenting cells. An immune response may be to immunogens that the subject's immune system recognizes as foreign (e.g., non-self antigens from microorganisms (e.g., pathogens), or self-antigens recognized as foreign). Thus, it is to be understood that, as used herein, "immune response" refers to any type of immune response, including, but not limited to, innate immune responses (e.g., activation of Toll receptor signaling cascade) cell- mediated immune responses (e.g., responses mediated by T cells (e.g., antigen-specific T cells) and non-specific cells of the immune system) and humoral immune responses (e.g., responses mediated by B cells (e.g., via generation and secretion of antibodies into the plasma, lymph, and/or tissue fluids). The term "immune response" is meant to encompass all aspects of the capability of a subject's immune system to respond to an antigen and/or immunogen (e.g., both the initial response to an immunogen (e.g., a pathogen) as well as acquired (e.g., memory) responses that are a result of an adaptive immune response). As used herein, the terms "purified" or "to purify" refer to the removal of contaminants or undesired compounds from a sample or composition. As used herein, the term "substantially purified" refers to the removal of from about 70 to 90 %, up to 100%, of the contaminants or undesired compounds from a sample or composition. As used herein, the terms "administration" and "administering" refer to the act of giving a drug, prodrug, or other agent, or therapeutic treatment (e.g., a composition of the present invention) to a physiological system (e.g., a subject or in vivo, in vitro, or ex vivo cells, tissues, and organs). As used herein, the terms "co-administration" and "co-administering" refer to the administration of at least two agent(s) (e.g., a nanoemulsion and one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable substances (e.g., a second nanoemulsion)) or therapies to a subject. In some embodiments, the co-administration of two or more agents or therapies is concurrent. In other embodiments, a first agent/therapy is administered prior to a second agent/therapy. In some embodiments, co-administration can be via the same or different route of administration. Those of skill in the art understand that the formulations and/or routes of administration of the various agents or therapies used may vary. The appropriate dosage for co-administration can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. In some embodiments, when agents or therapies are co-administered, the respective agents or therapies are administered at lower dosages than appropriate for their administration alone.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to therapeutic nanoemulsion compositions and to methods of utilizing the same to treat a burn wound. In particular, nanoemulsion compositions are described herein that find use in reducing and/or preventing progression/conversion of a partial thickness burn wound (e.g., to deep partial thickness wound or a full thickness burn wound (e.g., by accelerating and/or improving burn wound healing)). Compositions and methods of the present invention find use in, among other things, clinical (e.g. therapeutic and preventative medicine), industrial, and research applications. Contemporary burn wound management involves early debridement and reconstruction of non- viable skin coupled with provision of supportive care and topical antimicrobial dressing changes to partial thickness burn wounds. The goal of modern burn wound care is to provide an optimal environment for epidermal renewal. Restoration of skin integrity takes place via regrowth of keratinocytes from preserved hair follicles or transfer of split thickness skin grafts harvested from non-burn regions. During the period of epidermal renewal it is important to avoid further injury to the skin, abrogate burn wound progression, and minimize secondary complications such as wound infection. Early excision of full- thickness burn eschar, immediate skin grafting, and treatment of remaining open or partial thickness areas of burn wound with topical antimicrobial agents has heretofore been the most effective way of minimizing burn wound colonization and invasive wound infection.(See, e.g., Bessey, Wound care. In Herndon DN, ed: Total Burn Care 3rd edition. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier Inc., 2007, pp 127-135.). Popular topical antimicrobial agents include silver sulfadiazine (SILVADENE), mafenide acetate (SULFAMYLON), and colloidal silver impregnated dressings (ACTICOAT, SILVERLON). Each of these agents has potential limitations such as variable ability to penetrate eschar, uneven efficacy against both Gram- negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and potential toxicity to host immune cells (See, e.g., Steinstraesser et al, Antimicrob Agents Chemother 46(6): 1837-1844, 2002). The invention is not limited by the type of burn wound that can be treated using the compositions and methods described herein. Indeed, any burn wound of the flesh or skin caused by a thermal insult, chemical insult, electrical insult, friction-induced insult and/or UV radiation insult can be treated. Burn wounds are classified based upon a number of criteria. Burns that affect only the superficial skin (epidermis) are known as superficial or first-degree burns that can be characterized by clinical findings of redness, moderate pain and no blistering. When damage penetrates into some of the underlying layers (epidermis and the dermis are damaged), the burn is characterized as a partial-thickness or second-degree burn that can be characterized by clinical findings of blistering, epidermal and dermal damage and severe pain (epidermis and dermis are destroyed and there is subcutaneous tissue damage). In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin (dermis, deep dermis, underlying tissue and possibly fascia bone or muscle). A fourth-degree burn involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle or bone. Burn wound progression (also known as conversion) is a process in which certain superficial partial-thickness burns spontaneously advance into deep partial-thickness or full- thickness wounds. Progression of an injury into deeper tissue is an important phenomenon in the treatment of thermal injury due to the fact that burn wound depth may be a significant determinant of morbidity and treatment. The depth of burn wounds is not entirely static, and multiple factors, each acting via a variety of pathophysiologic mechanisms, can promote the deepening of a burn wound. In a subacute time frame of 3-5 days, burns originally assessed to be superficial partial thickness have been observed to progress into deep partial-thickness or full-thickness burns (See, e.g., Kao and Garner, Plast Reconstr Surg. 2000; 105:2482- 2492). This process of progressive damage to initially unburned tissue surrounding a burn wound is referred to as burn wound progression/conversion. A schematic of burn wound conversion/progression is shown in FIG. 23 (See, e.g., Singh et al, Annals of Plastic Surgery, 59(1): 109-115 (2007)). The present invention provides nanoemulsion compositions and methods of using the same for the treatment of burn wounds. For example, as shown in the Examples, the present invention provides nanoemulsion compositions and methods of using the same to reduce, attenuate and/or prevent burn wound conversion/progression (e.g., from a partial thickness burn wound to a deep partial thickness burn wound or a full thickness burn wound). For example, in a preferred embodiment, the invention provides novel nanoemulsion formulations (e.g. described in Examples 1-5) that significantly reduce, limit and/or ameliorate tissue injury in burn wounds (e.g., partial thickness burn wounds (thereby preventing the progression/conversion of a partial thickness burn wound into a deep partial thickness burn wound and/or a full thickness burn wound)) while concurrently and substantially reducing bacterial growth (e.g., of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Staphylococcus aureus in a partial thickness burn (See Examples 4 and 5)). Reduction in the level of wound infection was associated with an attenuation of the local dermal inflammatory response (IL-i and IL-6) and diminished neutrophil sequestration. Cross sectional histology of burned skin demonstrated a reduction in infiltration of inflammatory cells into the burned skin treated with nanoemulsion (e.g., NB-201 or NB-402) compared to saline treated controls. The burned skin of saline and placebo treated rats and pigs demonstrated accentuated fibrosis and granulation tissue formation, while rats and pigs treated with nanoemulsion (e.g., NB-201 or NB-402) had minimal gross evidence of burn wound progression. Histological analysis revealed a loss of epidermis in the saline and placebo treated groups, with intact epidermis in nanoemulsion (e.g., NB-201 and NB-402) treated groups. Thus, the invention provides nanoemulsion compositions and methods utilizing nanoemulsion formulations described herein (e.g., for nanoemulsion therapy) to reduce, limit and/or ameliorate tissue injury in partial thickness burn wounds (e.g., thereby preventing the progression/conversion of a partial thickness burn wound into a deep partial thickness burn wound and/or a full thickness burn wound). In other embodiments, the present invention provides compositions and methods utilizing nanoemulsion formulations described herein (e.g., for nanoemulsion therapy) to reduce or prevent bacterial counts and inflammation associated with tissue injury in partial thickness burn wounds. As described herein, compositions and methods of the invention promote and/or induce skin regeneration and/or wound healing not possible (e.g., within any time frame) with conventional treatments heretofore available in the art. For example, in one embodiment, compositions and methods of the invention reduce and/or inhibit scarring associated with a wound (e.g., injury of the skin (e.g., burn wound (e.g., that is not made possible using conventional treatments (e.g., SILVADENE))) (See Examples 4 and 5). In another embodiment, compositions and methods of the invention reduce and/or inhibit scarring associated with wounds not caused by burn injury. For example, in some embodiments, the invention provides compositions and methods that reduce scarring from cuts, abrasions, acne, or other disturbance to the skin (e.g., dermis). Thus, in some embodiments, the invention provides a prophylactic and/or therapeutice treatment that specifically limits burn wound progression while also acting as an antimicrobial agent. In some embodiments, the compositions and methods described herein are used to treat and/or inhibit growth of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides compositions and methods utilizing nanoemulsion formulations described herein (e.g., for nanoemulsion therapy) as a wound treatment to limit the conversion of partial-thickness burns to full-thickness injury while controlling bacterial super-infection. While an understanding of a mechanism of action is not needed to practice the present invention and while the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism, in some embodiments, compositions and methods of the invention inhibit burn wound progression/conversion via promoting skin regeneration (See, e.g., Example 5). While an understanding of a mechanism of action is not needed to practice the present invention and while the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism, in some embodiments, compositions and methods of the invention inhibit burn wound progression/conversion via altering cytokine profile changes (e.g., local (e.g., at the site of the burn wound) and/or systemic cytokine profile changes) in the subject (See, e.g., Examples 4 and 5). Examples of cytokine profiles that are altered utilizing compositions and methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, IL-Ιβ, IL-6, TNFa, CXCLl and CXCL2. Use of the compositions and methods of the invention to alter cytokine profiles can be used to inhibit the inflammatory cascade (e.g., local and/or systemic inflammatory signaling) in a subject (See Examples 4 and 5). In addition, compositions and methods of the invention can be utilized to prevent, inhibit and/or reduce local inflammation, complement and neutrophil activation as well as histamine release (See, e.g., Examples 4 and 5). While an understanding of a mechanism of action is not needed to practice the present invention and while the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism, in some embodiments, compositions and methods of the invention inhibit burn wound progression/conversion via promoting hair follicle growth (See, e.g., Example 5). Use of the compositions and methods of the invention to promote hair follicle growth may may also promote skin growth and/or regeneration and/or maintenance post burn injury (See, e.g., Examples 4 and 5). In some embodiments, compositions and methods of the invention are used to reduce and/or prevent pain associated with burn wounds. While an understanding of a mechanism of action is not needed to practice the present invention and while the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism, in some embodiments, compositions and methods of the invention inhibit, reduce, and/or prevent pain associated with burn wounds via inhibition of IL-Ιβ expression. Compositions and methods of the invention prevent, inhibit and/or reduce heat coagulation and destruction of cell membranes (See Examples 4 and 5). Compositions and methods of the invention reduced and/or inhibited edema and/or fluid shifts that occur in response to burn injury. Compositions and methods of the invention also reduced and/or inhibited the disruption of osmotic hydrostatic gradients that occur in response to burn injury. Thus, compositions and methods of the invention can be utilized to maintain normal osmotic and hydrostatic gradients at the site of a burn wound. Compositions and methods of the invention also inhibited and/or prevented ischemic necrosis and protein denaturation associated with burn wounds (See Examples 4 and 5). Thus, compositions and methods of the invention can be utilized to prevent ischemic necrosis and protein denaturation associated with burn wounds (e.g., thereby inhibiting progression/conversion of a partial thickness burn wound to a full thickness burn wound). Experiments conducted during development of embodiments of the invention identified and characterized new nanoemulsion formulations effective at treating burn wounds (e.g., the inhibition of and/or reduction of burn wound conversion/progression (See, e.g., Examples 1-5)). Although an understanding of a mechanism of action is not needed to practice the present invention, and the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism of action, in some embodiments, a nanoemulsion composition of the invention that is applied to a wound following burn injury is able to penetrate more deeply and uniformly into a burn wound (e.g., thereby keeping the epidermis intact, reducing necrotic inflammation and/or reducing dermal necrosis (e.g., in a dose-dependent manner)). In a preferred embodiment, compositions and methods of the invention are used to accelerate the proliferation of undamaged epithelial cells that line the shaft of each hair follicle, thereby increasing skin regeneration after a burn wound (e.g., See Example 5). As shown in Examples 3,4 and 5, the present invention also provides methods of reducing, inhibiting and/or eliminating bacterial growth in a burn wound comprising providing a burn wound and a nanoemulsion and administering the nanoemulsion to the burn wound under conditions that bacterial growth is reduced, inhibited and/or eliminated. Compositions and methods of the invention find great utility in the prevention and treatment of microbial infection of burn wounds due to the fact that the antimicrobial mechanism of action of the compositions described herein are unlikely to lead to the development of microbial resistance. In some embodiments, a nanoemulsion composition described herein is combined with one or more antimicrobial drugs for administration to a burn wound to minimize bacterial growth at the burn wound site. The present invention is not limited to any particular antimicrobial drug. Indeed, any antimicrobial drug that inhibits bacterial growth known to those in the art can be utilized in combination with a nanoemulsion composition described herein. In addition to local effects, severe dermal burns are known to induce the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which results in a high-risk of end-organ dysfunction (See, e.g., Barton et al, J Burn Care Rehabil 18(l): l-9, 1997). Increased vascular permeability and systemic capillary leak as a consequence of SIRS following burn injury creates seepage of plasma into interstitial tissue throughout the body. This tissue edema and intravascular hypovolemia is responsible for a host of undesired clinical problems such as shock, pulmonary dysfunction, abdominal or extremity compartment syndrome, and cardiac failure. Accordingly, in some embodiments, and as shown in Examples 4 and 5, nanoemulsion compositions described herein can be administered to a burn wound to treat (e.g., reduce, attenuate and/or prevent) inflammation, tissue edema and/or intravascular hypovolemia at the site of a burn wound. Thus, in another preferred embodiment, compositions and methods of the invention are used to inhibit edema and/or fluid shifts that occur in response to burn injury. In some embodiments, reducing inflammation, tissue edema and/or intravascular hypovolemia at the site of a burn wound reduces the occurrence of shock, pulmonary dysfunction, abdominal or extremity compartment syndrome, and/or cardiac failure. In some embodiments, a nanoemulsion composition described herein is used in combination with (e.g., is co-administered with) one or more anti-inflammatory drugs to minimize early burn wound inflammation and tissue edema. The present invention is not limited to any particular anti-inflammatory drug. Indeed, any anti-inflammatory drug that minimizes early burn wound inflammation and tissue edema can be utilized in combination with a nanoemulsion composition described herein. In some embodiments, nanoemulsion formulations described herein (e.g., NB-201 and/or NB-402) is administered to a burn wound to prevent, attenuate and/or eradicate bacterial growth (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa, or other bacteria) within a burn wound (e.g, a partial thickness burn wound). Examples 1-5 show that reduction in microbial infection was coupled with generation of lower levels of local dermal pro-inflammatory cytokines and evidence of reduced neutrophil sequestration into the burn wound. This decrease in burn wound bacterial growth and inflammation also produced less capillary leak in the early post-thermal injury time-period. Having the ability to clinically reduce capillary leak and tissue edema in the immediate post-burn time-period provides a lesser need for large volume crystalloid fluid resuscitation and a reduction in the associated sequela of physiologic volume overload, pulmonary dysfunction, and abdominal compartment syndrome. Skin that is damaged by thermal injury loses its ability to protect the host against infection from both the loss of physical barrier function and the secondary immunosuppression caused by the thermal injury. Moreover, increased production of TGF-β and IL-10 during the post-burn period can result in immunosuppression.(See, e.g., Lyons et al, Arch Surg 134(12): 1317-1323, 1999; Varedi et al, Shock 16(5):380-382, 2001). It has been established that treatment of burn injured animals with anti-TGF-β can improve local and systemic clearance of P. aeruginosa (See, e.g., Huang et al, J Burn Care Res 27(5):682- 687, 2006). Inhibition of TGF-β also results in increased survival following bacterial challenge. As shown in Figures 2, 5, 8 and 25, nanoemulsion formulations of the invention can be used to alter cytokine expression in the context of a burn wound. Onset of a bacterial infection within a burn wound can delay or even reverse the tissue healing process (See, e.g., Steinstraesser et al, Crit Care Med 29(7): 1431-1437, 2001). Topical antimicrobial therapy is used to reduce the microbial load in the burn wound and reduce this risk of infection. Conventional topical agents have heretofore included silver nitrate (AgN03), silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, and nanocrystalline impregnated silver dressings. Silver nitrate is limited in its use because of the problem it creates from contact staining and its limited antifungal activity. Silver sulfadiazine is the mainstay of topical burn antimicrobial treatment. It is bactericidal against P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative enteric bacteria. Resistance to Silvadene by some of these organisms has emerged (See, e.g., Silver et al, J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol 33(7):627-634, 2006). The agent has limited antifungal activity, but can be used in conjunction with nystatin. Silvadene has no real ability to penetrate burn eschar and sometimes leads to leukopenia which requires conversion to another topical agent. The use of mafenide acetate is narrowed by the fact that it is bacteriostatic against select organisms, it has limited activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, and that its use over a large surface area can lead to a metabolic acidosis because of its metabolism into a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The nanocrystalline silver dressings have the broadest activity against burn wound pathogens of the current agents available. They have a modest ability to penetrate eschar and can be left in place for many days (See, e.g., Church et al, Clin Microbiol Rev 19(2):403-434, 2006). SB 202190, an inhibitor of activated p38 MAPK, can substantially reduce the dermal inflammation generated in burn wounds (See, e.g., Arbabi et al, Shock. 26(2):201-209, 2006). Thermal injury initiates dermal inflammatory and pro-apoptotic cell signaling. As shown in Examples 1-5, topical application of nanoemulsion formulations of the invention resulted in reduced hair follicle cell apoptosis within the dermis of burned skin. Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention provides nanoemulsion compositions that are utilized to reduce, when administered to a burn wound, conversion of the partial thickness burn wound within the "zone of stasis" to regions of full thickness burn. In patients without evidence of inhalational injury, the burn wound itself is the primary source triggering the systemic inflammatory response via generation of pro- inflammatory cytokines and sequestration of neutrophils into the burn wound (See, e.g., Hansbrough et al, J Surg Res 61(1): 17-22, 1996; Piccolo et al, Inflammation 23(4):371-385, 1999; Till et al, J Clin Invest 69(5): 1126-1135, 1982). Topical application of a p38 MAPK inhibitor can control the source of inflammation at the level of the dermis, resulting in lower levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, reduced neutrophil sequestration and microvascular damage, and less epithelial apoptosis in bum wound hair follicle cells (See, e.g., Ipaktchi et al., Shock. 26(2):201-209, 2006). Dermal source control of inflammation also reduces bacterial growth and attenuates the systemic inflammatory response resulting in less acute lung injury and cardiac dysfunction following partial thickness burn injury in a rodent model. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a nanoemulsion of the invention is utilized (e.g., administered) alone or in combination with an anti-inflammatory and/or antimicrobial agent to reduce local dermal inflammation and risk of infection within bum wounds (e.g., partial thickness wounds, full thickness wounds or other bum wounds). The present invention is not limited by the type of anti-inflammatory agent and/or antimicrobial utilized for co- administration with a nanoemulsion described herein. Indeed, a variety of anti-inflammatory agents and/or antimicrobial agents can be used including, but not limited to, silver nitrate (AgN03), silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, nanocrystalline impregnated silver dressings, p38 MAPK inhibitor (e.g., SB 202190), or another anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial agent described herein. In some embodiments, when a nanoemulsion of the invention is administered to a burn wound, the nanoemulsion can be administered (e.g., to a subject (e.g., to a bum or wound surface)) by multiple methods, including, but not limited to, direct use or being suspended in a solution (e.g., colloidal solution) and applied to a surface (e.g., a surface comprising bacteria (e.g., pathogenic bacteria) or susceptible to bacterial invasion); being sprayed onto a surface using a spray applicator; being mixed with fibrin glue and applied (e.g., sprayed) onto a surface (e.g., skin burn or wound); being impregnated onto a wound dressing or bandage and applying the bandage to a surface (e.g., an infection or bum wound); being applied by a controlled-release mechanism; or being impregnated on one or both sides of an acellular biological matrix that is then placed on a surface (e.g., skin bum or wound) thereby protecting at both the wound and graft interfaces.

Further, the nanoemulsions of the invention can be stable at about 4°C for a time period of at least up to about 1 month, at least up to about 3 months, at least up to about 6 months, at least up to about 12 months, at least up to about 18 months, at least up to about 2 years, at least up to about 2.5 years, at least up to about 3 years, at least up to about 3.5 years, at least up to about 4 years, at least up to about 4.5 years, at least up to about 5 years, at least up to about 5.5 years, at least up to about 6 years, at least up to about 6.5 years, or at least up to about 7 years. The nanoemulsion formulations of the invention are stable upon application, as surprisingly the nanoemulsions do not lose their physical structure upon application. For example, as shown in Example 2, components of the nanoemulsion formulations expected to react with materials used to apply the nanoemulsions (e.g., bandages and dressings) in fact did not react/bind. In fact, there was no binding of BAK, CPC or EDTA to the TELFA pad (See Example 2). Microscopic examination of skin surface following application of a nanoemulsion according to the invention demonstrated the physical integrity of the nanoemulsions of the invention. While an understading of a mechanism is not needed to practice the present invention, and while the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism, in some embodiments, physical integrity results in the desired absorption observed with the nanoemulsions of the invention. Nanoemulsions The term "nanoemulsion", as defined herein, refers to a dispersion or droplet or any other lipid structure. Typical lipid structures contemplated in the invention include, but are not limited to, unilamellar, paucilamellar and multilamellar lipid vesicles, micelles and lamellar phases.

The nanoemulsion can further comprise EDTA. In preferred embodiments, the invention provides a nanoemulsion described in Examples 1-5. In other preferred embodiments, the invention provides a nanoemulsion composition identified utilizing compositions and methods of identifying and characterizing nanoemulsions useful for the treatment of burn wounds described herein (See, e.g., Examples 1-5). Quantities of each component present in the nanoemulsion refer to a therapeutic nanoemulsion, and not to a nanoemulsion to be tested in vitro. This is significant, as nanoemulsions tested in vitro generally have lower concentrations of oil, organic solvent, surfactant or detergent, and (if present) chelating agent than that present in a nanoemulsion intended for therapeutic use, e.g., topical use. This is because in vitro studies do not require the nanoemulsion droplets to traverse the skin. For topical, aerosol, intradermal etc. use, the concentrations of the components must be higher to result in a therapeutic nanoemulsion. However, the relative quantities of each component used in a nanoemulsion tested in vitro are applicable to a nanoemulsion to be used therapeutically and, therefore, in vitro quantities can be scaled up to prepare a therapeutic composition, and in vitro data is predictive of topical application success. 1. Aqueous Phase The aqueous phase can comprise any type of aqueous phase including, but not limited to, water (e.g., H20, distilled water, tap water) and solutions (e.g., phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution). In certain embodiments, the aqueous phase comprises water at a pH of about 4 to 10, preferably about 6 to 8. The water can be deionized (hereinafter "DiH20").

The hydrophilic portion can be nonionic, ionic or zwitterionic. The hydrocarbon chain interacts weakly with the water molecules in an aqueous environment, whereas the polar or ionic head group interacts strongly with water molecules via dipole or ion-dipole interactions.

Active Agents Incorporated into a Nanoemulsion of the Invention In a further embodiment of the invention, a nanoemulsion comprises an additional active agent, such as an antibiotic or a palliative agent (such as for burn wound treatment). Addition of another agent may enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of the nanoemulsion. The nanoemulsion in and of itself has anti-bacterial activity and does not need to be combined with another active agent to obtain therapeutic effectiveness. Any antibacterial (or antibiotic) agent suitable for treating a bacterial infection can be incorporated into the topical nanoemulsions of the invention. Examples of such antibiotic agents include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, Ansamycins, Carbacephems, Carbapenems, Cephalosporins, Glycopeptides, Macrolides, Monobactams, Penicillins, Polypeptides, Polymyxin, Quinolones, Sulfonamides, Tetracyclines, and others (e.g., Arsphenamine, Chloramphenicol, Clindamycin, Lincomycin, Ethambutol, Fosfomycin, Fusidic acid, Furazolidone, Isoniazid, Linezolid, Metronidazole, Mupirocin, Nitrofurantoin, Platensimycin, Pyrazinamide, Quinupristin/Dalfopristin, Rifampicin (Rifampin in US), Thiamphenicol, Tinidazole, Dapsone, and lofazimine).

Pharmaceutical Compositions The nanoemulsion formulations the invention may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions that comprise the nanoemulsion in a therapeutically effective amount and suitable, pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients for administration to a human subject in need thereof using any conventional pharmaceutical method of administration. Such excipients are well known in the art. By the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" it is meant any amount of the nanoemulsion that is effective in treating a burn wound (e.g., to prevent the progression of a partial thickness burn wound to a deep partial thickness burn wound and/or a full thickness burn wound). In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is a dilution of a concentrated nanoemulsion formulation (e.g., dilutions of a concentrated composition may be administered to a subject such that the subject receives any one or more of the specific dosages provided herein). In some embodiments, dilution of a concentrated composition may be made such that a subject is administered (e.g., to a burn wound in a single or multiple doses) a composition comprising 0.5-50% of the nanoemulsion present in the concentrated composition. Exemplary dosage forms may include, but are not limited to, patches, ointments, creams, emulsions, liquids, lotions, gels, bioadhesive gels, aerosols, pastes, foams, sunscreens, capsules, microcapsules, or in the form of an article or carrier, such as a bandage, insert, syringe-like applicator, pessary, powder, and talc or other solid. The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for immediate release, sustained release, controlled release, delayed release, or any combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the formulations may comprise a penetration-enhancing agent for enhancing penetration of the nanoemulsion through the stratum corneum and into the epidermis or dermis (e.g., for methods of treating burn wounds). Suitable penetration-enhancing agents include, but are not limited to, alcohols such as ethanol, triglycerides and aloe compositions. The amount of the penetration-enhancing agent may comprise from about 0.5% to about 40% by weight of the formulation. When appropriate, for example when treating burn wounds, the nanoemulsions of the invention can be applied and/or delivered utilizing electrophoretic delivery/electrophoresis. Such transdermal methods, which comprise applying an electrical current, are well known in the art. In another embodiment of the invention, minimal systemic absorption of the nanoemulsion occurs upon topical administration. Such minimal systemic exposure can be determined by the detection of less than 10 ng/mL, less than 8 ng/mL, less than 5 ng/mL, less than 4 ng/mL, less than 3 ng/mL, or less than 2 ng/mL of the one or more surfactants present in the nanoemulsion in the plasma of the subject. Lack of systemic absorption may be monitored, for example, by measuring the amount of the surfactant, such as the cationic surfactant, in the plasma of the human subject undergoing treatment. Amounts of surfactant of equal to or less than about 10 ng/ml in the plasma confirms minimal systemic absorption. The pharmaceutical compositions may be applied in a single administration or in multiple administrations. The pharmaceutical compositions can be applied for at least one day, at least two days at least three days at least four days at least 5 days, once a week, at least twice a week, at least once a day, at least twice a day, multiple times daily, multiple times weekly, biweekly, at least once a month, or any combination thereof. Following administration, the nanoemulsion may be occluded or semi-occluded. Occlusion or semi-occlusion may be performed by overlaying a bandage, polyoleofm film, article of clothing, impermeabile barrier, or semi-impermeable barrier to the topical preparation. Several exemplary nanoemulsions are described in Examples 1-5, although the compositions and methods of the invention are not limited to these specific nanoemulsions. For example, the invention provides a nanoemulsion composition identified utilizing compositions and described herein (e.g., compositions and methods for identifying and characterizing nanoemulsions useful for the treatment of burn wounds (See, e.g., Examples 1- 5)). The components and quantity of each can be varied as described herein in the preparation of other nanoemulsions. Exemplary emulsions of the invention are provided in the Examples (e.g., in Example 1, Tables 10 and 11, below). In some embodiments, nanoemulsion formulations of the invention have an average particle (droplet) size of about 200 nm to about 600 nm. In more preferred embodiments, nanoemulsion formulations of the invention have an average particle (droplet) size of about 300 nm -400 nm, 325 nm -375 nm, 350 nm-370 nm, 360 nm, although smaller (e.g., less than about 300 nm) and larger (e.g., greater than 400 nm) particle sizes also find use in the compositions and methods described herein). In a preferred embodiments, nanoemulsion formulations of the invention undergoes high pressure processing in order to have a particle (droplet) size of about 360 nm. Methods of Manufacture Nanoemulsion formulations of the invention can be formed using classic emulsion forming techniques (See, e.g., U.S. 2004/0043041. See also U.S. Patent Nos. 6,015,832, 6,506,803, 6,559,189, 6,635,676 , and US Patent Publication No. 20040043041, all of which are incorporated by reference). In addition, methods of making emulsions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,103,497 and 4,895,452 (herein incorporated by reference). In an exemplary method, the oil is mixed with the aqueous phase under relatively high shear forces (e.g., using high hydraulic and mechanical forces) to obtain a nanoemulsion comprising oil droplets having an average diameter of less than about 1000 nm. Some embodiments of the invention employ a nanoemulsion having an oil phase comprising an alcohol such as ethanol. The oil and aqueous phases can be blended using any apparatus capable of producing shear forces sufficient to form an emulsion, such as French Presses or high shear mixers (e.g., FDA approved high shear mixers are available, for example, from Admix, Inc., Manchester, N.H.). Methods of producing such emulsions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,103,497 and 4,895,452, herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. In an exemplary embodiment, the nanoemulsions used in the methods of the invention comprise droplets of an oily discontinuous phase dispersed in an aqueous continuous phase, such as water. The nanoemulsions of the invention are stable, and do not decompose even after long storage periods. Certain nanoemulsions of the invention are non-toxic and safe when swallowed, inhaled, or contacted to the skin of a subject. The compositions of the invention can be produced in large quantities and are stable for many months at a broad range of temperatures. The nanoemulsion can have textures ranging from that of a semi-solid cream to that of a thin lotion, and can be applied topically by hand, and can be sprayed onto a surface or nebulized. As stated above, at least a portion of the emulsion may be in the form of lipid structures including, but not limited to, unilamellar, multilamellar, and paucliamellar lipid vesicles, micelles, and lamellar phases. The present invention contemplates that many variations of the described nanoemulsions will be useful in the methods of the present invention. To determine if a candidate nanoemulsion is suitable for use with the present invention, three criteria are analyzed. Using the methods and standards described herein, candidate emulsions can be easily tested to determine if they are suitable. First, the desired ingredients are prepared using the methods described herein, to determine if a nanoemulsion can be formed. If a nanoemulsion cannot be formed, the candidate is rejected. Second, the candidate nanoemulsion should form a stable emulsion. A nanoemulsion is stable if it remains in emulsion form for a sufficient period to allow its intended use. For example, for nanoemulsions that are to be stored, shipped, etc., it may be desired that the nanoemulsion remain in emulsion form for months to years. Typical nanoemulsions that are relatively unstable, will lose their form within a day. Third, the candidate nanoemulsion should have efficacy for its intended use. For example, the emulsions of the invention should kill or disable microorganisms in vitro. To determine the suitability of a particular candidate nanoemulsion against a desired microorganism, the nanoemulsion is exposed to the microorganism for one or more time periods in a side-by-side experiment with an appropriate control sample (e.g., a negative control such as water) and determining if, and to what degree, the nanoemulsion kills or disables the microorganism. The nanoemulsion of the invention can be provided in many different types of containers and delivery systems. For example, in some embodiments of the invention, the nanoemulsions are provided as a liquid, lotion, cream or other solid or semi-solid form. The nanoemulsions of the invention may be incorporated into hydrogel formulations. The nanoemulsions can be delivered (e.g., to a subject or customers) in any suitable container. Suitable containers can be used that provide one or more single use or multi-use dosages of the nanoemulsion for the desired application. In some embodiments of the invention, the nanoemulsions are provided in a suspension or liquid form. Such nanoemulsions can be delivered in any suitable container including spray bottles (e.g., pressurized spray bottles, nebulizers).

The ointment base can comprise one or more of petrolatum, mineral oil, ceresin, lanolin alcohol, panthenol, glycerin, bisabolol, cocoa butter and the like. Methods of intranasal and pulmonary administration are well known in the art, including the administration of a droplet or spray form of the nanoemulsion into the nasopharynx of a subject to be treated. In some embodiments, a nebulized or aerosolized composition comprising a nanoemulsion is provided. Enteric formulations such as gastro resistant capsules for oral administration, suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration may also form part of this invention. Compositions of the present invention may also be administered via the oral route. Under these circumstances, a composition comprising a nanoemulsion may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and/or include alkaline buffers, or enteric capsules. Formulations for nasal delivery may include those with dextran or cyclodextran and saponin as an adjuvant. In some embodiments, an aqueous solution containing the nanoemulsion is gently and thoroughly mixed to form a solution. The solution is sterile filtered (e.g., through a 0.2 micron filter) into a sterile, enclosed vessel. Under sterile conditions, the solution is passed through an appropriately small orifice to make droplets (e.g., between 0.1 and 10 microns). The particles may be administered using any of a number of different applicators. Suitable methods for manufacture and administration are described in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,592,904; 6,518,239; 6,423,344; 6,294,204; 6,051,256 and 5,997,848 to INHALE (now NEKTAR); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,309; RE37,053; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,436,443; 6,447,753; 6,503,480; and 6,635,283, to Edwards, et al. (MIT, AIR), each of which is hereby incorporated Thus, in some embodiments, compositions of the present invention are administered by pulmonary delivery. For example, a composition of the present invention can be delivered to the lungs of a subject (e.g., a human) via inhalation (See, e.g., Adjei, et al. Pharmaceutical Research 1990; 7:565-569; Adjei, et al. Int. J. Pharmaceutics 1990; 63: 135-144; Braquet, et al. J. Cardiovascular Pharmacology 1989 143-146; Hubbard, et al. (1989) Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. Ill, pp. 206-212; Smith, et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1989;84: 1145-1146; Oswein, et al. "Aerosolization of Proteins", 1990; Proceedings of Symposium on Respiratory Drug Delivery II Keystone, Colorado; Debs, et al. J. Immunol. 1988; 140:3482-3488; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,656 to Platz, et al, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). A method and composition for pulmonary delivery of drugs for systemic effect is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,569 to Wong, et al, hereby incorporated by reference; See also U.S. Pat. No. 6,651,655 to Licalsi et al, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety)). In some embodiments, a composition comprising a nanoemulsion is administered to a subject by more than one route or means (e.g., administered via pulmonary route as well as a mucosal route). Further contemplated for use in the practice of this invention are a wide range of mechanical devices designed for pulmonary and/or nasal mucosal delivery of pharmaceutical agents including, but not limited to, nebulizers, metered dose inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art. Some specific examples of commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the ULTRA VENT nebulizer (Mallinckrodt Inc., St. Louis, Mo.); the ACORN II nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products, Englewood, Colo.); the VENTOLIN metered dose inhaler (Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, N.C.); and the SPINHALER powder inhaler (Fisons Corp., Bedford, Mass.). All such devices require the use of formulations suitable for dispensing of the therapeutic agent. Typically, each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the use of an appropriate propellant material, in addition to the usual diluents, adjuvants, surfactants, carriers and/or other agents useful in therapy. Also, the use of liposomes, microcapsules or microspheres, inclusion complexes, or other types of carriers is contemplated. As described above, the present invention is not limited by the type of subject administered a composition of the present invention. Indeed, a wide variety of subjects are contemplated to be benefited from administration of a composition of the present invention. In preferred embodiments, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, human subjects are of any age (e.g., adults, children, infants, etc.) that have a burn wound. In some embodiments, the human subjects are subjects that are more likely to receive a direct exposure to pathogenic microorganisms or that are more likely to display signs and symptoms of disease after exposure to a pathogen (e.g., subjects in the armed forces, government employees, frequent travelers, persons attending or working in a school or daycare, health care workers, an elderly person, an immunocompromised person, and emergency service employees (e.g., police, fire, EMT employees)). In some embodiments, any one or all members of the general public can be administered a composition of the present invention. A composition comprising a nanoemulsion of the present invention can be administered (e.g., to a subject or to microbes (e.g., bacteria (e.g., opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacteria (e.g., residing on or within a burn wound)))) as a therapeutic or as a prophylactic to prevent microbial infection. Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of altering microbial (e.g., bacterial (e.g., opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacterial) growth comprising administering a composition comprising a nanoemulsion to the microbes (e.g., bacteria (e.g., opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacteria). In some embodiments, administration of a composition comprising a nanoemulsion to the microbes (e.g., bacteria (e.g., opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacteria) kills the microbes. In some embodiments, administration of a composition comprising nanoemulsion to the microbes (e.g., bacteria (e.g., opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacteria) inhibits growth of the microbes. It is contemplated that a composition comprising a nanoemulsion can be administered to microbes (e.g., bacteria (e.g., opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacteria (e.g., residing within the respiratory tract))) via a number of delivery routes and/or mechanisms. Compositions of the present invention may additionally contain other adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example, antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the compositions of the present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, preferably do not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions of the present invention. The formulations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents (e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like) that do not deleteriously interact with the nanoemulsion. In some embodiments, nanoemulsion compositions of the present invention are administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. When used the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic. Also, such salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid group. Suitable buffering agents include, but are not limited to, acetic acid and a salt (1-2% w/v); citric acid and a salt (1-3% w/v); boric acid and a salt (0.5-2.5%) w/v); and phosphoric acid and a salt (0.8-2% w/v). Suitable preservatives may include benzalkonium chloride (0.003-0.03% w/v); chlorobutanol (0.3-0.9% w/v); parabens (0.01-0.25% w/v) and thimerosal (0.004-0.02% w/v). In some embodiments, a composition comprising a nanoemulsion is co-administered with one or more antibiotics. For example, one or more antibiotics may be administered with, before and/or after administration of a composition comprising a nanoemulsion. The present invention is not limited by the type of antibiotic co-administered. Indeed, a variety of antibiotics may be co-administered including, but not limited to, β -lactam antibiotics, penicillins (such as natural penicillins, aminopenicillins, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, carboxy penicillins, ureido penicillins), cephalosporins (first generation, second generation, and third generation cephalosporins), and other β -lactams (such as imipenem, monobactams,), β -lactamase inhibitors, vancomycin, aminoglycosides and spectinomycin, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, lincomycin, clindamycin, rifampin, metronidazole, polymyxins, doxycycline, quinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), sulfonamides, trimethoprim, and quino lines. A wide variety of antimicrobial agents are currently available for use in treating bacterial, fungal and viral infections. For a comprehensive treatise on the general classes of such drugs and their mechanisms of action, the skilled artisan is referred to Goodman & Gilman's "The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics" Eds. Hardman et al., 9th Edition, Pub. McGraw Hill, chapters 43 through 50, 1996, (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Generally, these agents include agents that inhibit cell wall synthesis (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, cycloserine, vancomycin, bacitracin); and the imidazole antifungal agents (e.g., miconazole, ketoconazole and clotrimazole); agents that act directly to disrupt the cell membrane of the microorganism (e.g., detergents such as polmyxin and colistimethate and the antifungals nystatin and amphotericin B); agents that affect the ribosomal subunits to inhibit protein synthesis (e.g., chloramphenicol, the tetracyclines, erthromycin and clindamycin); agents that alter protein synthesis and lead to cell death (e.g., aminoglycosides); agents that affect nucleic acid metabolism (e.g., the rifamycins and the quinolones); the antimetabolites (e.g., trimethoprim and sulfonamides); and the nucleic acid analogues such as zidovudine, gangcyclovir, vidarabine, and acyclovir which act to inhibit viral enzymes essential for DNA synthesis. Various combinations of antimicrobials may be employed. The present invention also includes methods involving co-administration of a composition comprising a nanoemulsion with one or more additional active and/or anti- infective agents. In co-administration procedures, the agents may be administered concurrently or sequentially. In one embodiment, the compositions described herein are administered prior to the other active agent(s). The pharmaceutical formulations and modes of administration may be any of those described herein. In addition, the two or more coadministered agents may each be administered using different modes (e.g., routes) or different formulations. The additional agents to be co-administered (e.g., antibiotics, a second type of nanoemulsion, etc.) can be any of the well-known agents in the art, including, but not limited to, those that are currently in clinical use. In some embodiments, a composition comprising a nanoemulsion is administered to a subject via more than one route. For example, a subject may benefit from receiving mucosal administration (e.g., nasal administration or other mucosal routes described herein) and, additionally, receiving one or more other routes of administration (e.g., pulmonary administration (e.g., via a nebulizer, inhaler, or other methods described herein. Other delivery systems can include time -release, delayed release or sustained release delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compositions, increasing convenience to the subject and a physician. Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer based systems such as poly (lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and polyanhydrides. Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,075, 109, hereby incorporated by reference.

Nos. 3,854,480, 5,133,974 and 5,407,686, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, pump-based hardware delivery systems can be used, some of which are adapted for implantation. The present invention is not limited by the amount of nanoemulsion used. In some preferred embodiments, the amount of nanoemulsion in a composition comprising a nanoemulsion is selected as that amount which treats a burn wound (e.g., prevents conversion of a partial thickness burn wound to a deep partial thickness burn wound and/or a full thickness burn wound) without significant, adverse side effects. The amount will vary depending upon which specific nanoemulsion(s) is/are employed, and can vary from subject to subject, depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the species, age and general condition (e.g., health) of the subject, and the mode of administration. Procedures for determining the appropriate amount of nanoemulsion administered to a subject can be readily determined using known means by one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, it is expected that each dose (e.g., of a composition comprising a nanoemulsion (e.g., administered to a subject) comprises 1-100% nanoemulsion, in some embodiments, 20%> nanoemulsion, in some embodiments less than 20%> (e.g., 15%, 10%, 8%, 5% or less nanoemulsion), and in some embodiments greater than 20% nanoemulsion (e.g., 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or more nanoemulsion). In some embodiments, it is expected that each dose (e.g., of a composition comprising a nanoemulsion (e.g., administered to a subject) is from 0.001 to 40%> or more (e.g., 0.001- 10%, 0.5-5%, 1-3%, 2%, 6%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40% or more) by weight nanoemulsion. Similarly, the present invention is not limited by the duration of time a nanoemulsion is administered to a subject. In some embodiments, a nanoemulsion is administered one or more times (e.g. twice, three times, four times or more) daily. In some embodiments, a composition comprising a nanoemulsion is administered one or more times a day. In some embodiments, a composition comprising a nanoemulsion of the present invention is formulated in a concentrated dose that is diluted prior to administration to a subject. For example, dilutions of a concentrated composition may be administered to a subject such that the subject receives any one or more of the specific dosages provided herein. In some embodiments, dilution of a concentrated composition may be made such that a subject is administered (e.g., in a single dose) a composition comprising 0.5-50% of the nanoemulsion present in the concentrated composition. Concentrated compositions are contemplated to be useful in a setting in which large numbers of subjects may be administered a composition of the present invention (e.g., a hospital). In some embodiments, a composition comprising a nanoemulsion of the present invention (e.g., a concentrated composition) is stable at room temperature for more than 1 week, in some embodiments for more than 2 weeks, in some embodiments for more than 3 weeks, in some embodiments for more than 4 weeks, in some embodiments for more than 5 weeks, and in some embodiments for more than 6 weeks. Dosage units may be proportionately increased or decreased based on several factors including, but not limited to, the weight, age, and health status of the subject. In addition, dosage units may be increased or decreased for subsequent administrations. In some embodiments, a composition comprising a nanoemulsion is administered to a subject under conditions such that microbes (e.g., bacteria (e.g., opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacteria)) are killed. In some embodiments, a composition comprising a nanoemulsion is administered to a subject under conditions such that microbial (e.g., bacterial (e.g., opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacterial) growth is prohibited and/or attenuated. In some embodiments, greater than 90% (e.g., greater than 95%, 98%, 99%, all detectable) of microbes (e.g., bacteria (e.g., opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacteria) are killed. In some embodiments, there is greater than 2 log (e.g., greater than 3 log, 4 log, 5 log, or more) reduction in microbe (e.g., bacteria (e.g., opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacteria) presence. In some embodiments, reduction and/or killing is observed in one hour or less (e.g., 45 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, or less). In some embodiments, reduction and/or killing is observed in 6 hours or less (e.g., 5 hours, 4, hours, 3 hours, two hours or less than one hour). In some embodiments, reduction and/or killing is observed in two days or less following initial treatment (e.g., less than 24 hours, less than 20 hours, 18 hours or less). In some embodiments, the reduction and/or killing is observed in three days or less, four days or less, or five days or less. A composition comprising a nanoemulsion of the present invention finds use where the nature of the infectious and/or disease causing agent (e.g., causing signs, symptoms or indications of respiratory infection) is known, as well as where the nature of the infectious and/or disease causing agent is unknown (e.g., in emerging disease (e.g., of pandemic proportion (e.g., influenza or other outbreaks of disease))). For example, the present invention contemplates use of the compositions of the present invention in treatment of or prevention of infections associated with an emergent infectious and/or disease causing agent yet to be identified (e.g., isolated and/or cultured from a diseased person but without genetic, biochemical or other characterization of the infectious and/or disease causing agent). It is contemplated that the compositions and methods of the present invention will find use in various settings, including research settings. For example, compositions and methods of the present invention also find use in studies of the immune system (e.g., characterization of adaptive immune responses (e.g., protective immune responses (e.g., mucosal or systemic immunity))). Uses of the compositions and methods provided by the present invention encompass human and non-human subjects and samples from those subjects, and also encompass research applications using these subjects. Compositions and methods of the present invention are also useful in studying and optimizing nanoemulsions and other components and for screening for new components. Thus, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular subject and/or application setting. The formulations can be tested in vivo in a number of animal models developed for the study of topical routes of delivery. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a kit comprising a composition comprising a nanoemulsion. In some embodiments, the kit further provides a device or material for administering the composition. The present invention is not limited by the type of device or material included in the kit. In some embodiments, a kit comprises a composition comprising a nanoemulsion in a concentrated form (e.g., that can be diluted prior to administration to a subject). In some embodiments, all kit components are present within a single container (e.g., vial or tube). In some embodiments, each kit component is located in a single container (e.g., vial or tube).

In some embodiments, a kit comprises a buffer. In some embodiments, the kit further comprises instructions for use. Nanoemulsion formulations and compositions comprising the same described herein may additionally contain other adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example, antipuritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the compositions of the present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, preferably do not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the immunogenic compositions described herein. The formulations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents (e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like) that do not deleteriously interact with the NE and immunogen of the formulation. In some embodiments, immunogenic compositions described herein are administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. When used the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic.

It should be understood that a range between any two figures listed above is specifically contemplated to be encompassed within the metes and bounds of the present invention. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the specific pathogen and the subject being immunized. EXPERIMENTAL The following examples are provided in order to demonstrate and further illustrate certain preferred embodiments and aspects of the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof. Example 1 Novel nanoemulsion formulations and stability Experiments were conducted in order to generate and characterize novel nanoemulsions. A total of 50 formulations were produced by varying 5 different cationic surfactants and/or by varying the ratio of cationic to non-ionic surfactants (surfactant blend) in the nanoemulsion (NE) formulation within a particular surfactant family. Table 1 provides a summary of the number of nanoemulsion that passed or failed. Table 2 describes the cationic surfactant used in these studies. Table 3 shows two of the nonionic surfactant used in these studies. Table 4 shows the qualitative formula for the various nanoemulsions when the surfactant blend ratio of the cationic surfactant is altered from 6: 1 to 1 : 1 to 1 :6, etc. The oil-in-water nanoemulsion were manufactured at a 500 gram scale by combining the excipients using simple mixing followed by high shear homogenization. This mixture was homogenized for 10 minutes using a Silverson L4RT Batch Homogenizer with Fine Emulsion Screen at 10,000rpm. All the ingredients in the nanoemulsion meet USP/NF Pharmacopoeia compendial requirements and are included in the CDER List of Inactive Ingredients for Approved Drug Products database. The concentrated product (100% NE) was diluted by simple mixing to achieve desired concentration for use (e.g., 10%>, 20%>, 30%> or 40% NE). The formulations were then placed on stability for 2 weeks at 22°C and 40°C. The physical characteristics of the nanoemulsion were measured by particle size analysis and zeta potential. Dynamic light scattering using the Malvern Zetasizer was used to determine particle size, particle size distribution profiles and the polydispersity index after completion of the manufacture by diluting the 100% nanoemulsion to 1% in deionize distilled water pre- filtered through a 0.22μιη filter. The acceptance criteria for particle size was that there was an absence of change in the mean particle size greater than 30% from the original mean particle size. A change greater than 30% was considered a failure. The appearance was also monitored. The passing criterion for appearance was no phase separation. If there was phase separation of the formulations, the formulation failed. Tables 4-8 provide details of each manufactured formulation with respect to composition and stability results. Table 1 is a summary of the total number of formulations that passed or failed stability assessment based on physical appearance (no evidence of phase separation) and uniform particle size (uni-modal distribution and change in PS within 30% of original median size) at time zero and after storage for 2 weeks under accelerated conditions of 22 °C and 40 °C. Table 1. Overall summary of the number of nanoemulsion formulations manufactured and placed upon stability. Several of the cationic surfactants used during development of embodiments of the invention are listed in Table 2. The structures of two nonionic surfactants that were combined with the cationic surfactants during development of some of the embodiments of the invention are shown in Table 3. *Critical concentration for unilamellar vesicles Table 2. Summary of cationic surfactants used in stability testing. Table 3. Comparison of two nonionic surfactants. Table 4 A. Examples of Quantitative Composition of 100% Nanoemulsion Formulations. Stability of Novel Nanoemulsion Formulations Particle size is an additional property of nanoemulsions which may impact antimicrobial activity. The library of different nanoemulsions shown in Tables 4-8 provides multiple families of compounds with varying particle sizes ranging from 211 - 585 nm. The majority of these nanoemulsion formulations were manufactured by homogenization. Based on the overall stability results, formulations containing CPC in combination with various nonionic surfactants at varying ratios are stable as shown in Table 4B. However, other formulations containing benzalkonium chloride (BAC) were unstable when the surfactant blend ratio (cationic: nonionic) of BAC to non-ionic surfactant changed from 1 :6 to 1 : 1 or 6: 1 (Table 5). Cationic surfactants in addition to CPC and BAC were investigated and their structure, molecular weight, HLB and CMC are summarized in Table 2 (above). Accordingly, experiments were conducted in order to investigate how the polar head unit of the cationic surfactant affects the stability of the emulsion. Table 4B. Stability Resu ts of the Cetypyridinum Chloride Nanoemulsion Formulations *NF=nanoemulsion did not form In order to investigate the effect of a larger cationic surfactant polar head group, cocamidopropyl betaine (CAB) was selected. Cocamidopropyl betaine (CAB) has an HLB around 11, which indicates hydrophobicity balance between the polar head group and non- polar tail. CAB formulated with Tween 80 and P407 formed stable emulsions, however CAB did not form a stable emulsion with Tween 20 or PI 88 as reported in Table 6. Cocamidopropyl betaine has a 12 carbon chain length combined with a more linear or larger polar head group. The optimization of the polar head and hydrophobic tail regions of the cationic surfactants appeared to be important for stability. Ta e 6. Sta ty resu ts o ormu at ons w t cocam opropy eta ne CAB *NF=nanoemulsion did not form To investigate the effect of a longer hydrophobic chain tail group, stearalkonium chloride (SAC) was selected. SAC's longer 18 carbon hydrophobic tail resulted in a lowering of the HLB for SAC as compared to BCL. Hence, SAC is less prone to migration into aqueous phase as compared to BCL (better residence at the oil/water interface). SAC has a polar head group with similar size to CPC or BCL. Both surfactants have the same structure of cationic polar head group. Stability assessments for stearalkonium chloride (SAC) are listed in Table 7. Table 7. Stability results of stearalkonium chloride (SAC) nanoemulsion formulations. To investigate the effect of a dual hydrophobic chain tail group verses a single chain group, dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DODAC) was selected. Dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DODAC) has two CI 8 carbon chain tails. DODAC also have a smaller polar head group when compared to CPC. These surfactants were more difficult to formulate with various nonionic surfactants, especially the poloxamers, and various manufacturing alternations were made (e.g. elevation of temperature, addition of water in the neat phase, extended homogenization times). The mean particle size was larger for the DODAC formulation than for some other cationic surfactant formulations manufactured. Additionally, some of these formulations exhibited bi-modal particle size distributions as reported in Tables 8. However, some DODAC were deemed stable. The particle size distributions remained unimodal or bimodal throughout the stability evaluation. ' ternative manu acturing process. NF=nanoemu sion i not orm Table 8. Stability results of formulations with DODAC. Bio-loading screening protocol for the panel of novel nanoemulsion formulations. Experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the potential impact of wound exudates or "bio-burden" on the stability and efficacy of antimicrobial NEs for application in multiple types of wounds. Wound exudates typically contain of fibrin, platelets, serum components, white blood cells and/or other types of mediators and debris associated with tissue injury, inflammation and repair. The presence of wound exudates or "bio-burden" at the site of topical application may impact the stability and antimicrobial efficacy of NEs of varying compositions depending on the type of wound. Therefore, experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential impact of human serum as a model to mimic the effects of bio-loading on NE stability and antimicrobial activity. One focus was to develop a series of nanoemulsion formulations that could be used in a bio loading screening study to look at the effect of the bio loading of human serum proteins on the physical chemical properties of the nanoemulsions. These studies looked at the effect of human serum concentration on the physical integrity of the nanoemulsion droplets. The ratio of nanoemulsion and serum protein (or bio-load) was at a 1 : 1 ratio of nanoemulsion and to a range of serum concentrations in broth. It was also determined that concentration of EDTA in the nanoemulsion compositions is an important factor for combating bio-load effects and improved anti-microbial activity. The dilution factor of that material for high quality zeta potential measuring was determined. The percentage of serum in the broth solution was evaluated at 1.5%, 3.13%, 6.25% 12.5%, 25% and 50%. The dilution of those samples for zeta potential measure was optimized at 0.015% in 10 mM EDTA. The 10 mM concentration of EDTA was equivalent to that the external phase in the 1 : 1 nanoemulsion:serum broth mixture. The final bio-load protocol for testing nanoemulsion with serum protein was as follows: Protocol for Bio-load Formulation Screening: 1. 30% nanoemulsion formulation containing 20 mM EDTA 2. Four serum percentages in broth: 6.25%, 12%, 25% and 50% 3. 1 : 1 ratio of 30% nanomeulsion to the serum/broth mixture 4. 0.015% Nanoemulsion/serum mixture in 10 mM EDTA for particle size analysis and zeta analysis. Table 9. Nanoemulsion formulations screened in bio-load study. The effect of the surfactant blend ratio in three different CPC/Tween 20 formulations at a 1 :6, 1 : 1, and 6: 1 ratio, all containing 20 mM EDTA is shown in FIG. 25. The surfactant blend ratio affects the physical stability of the nanoemulsion droplets when in the presence of serum proteins. The larger proportion of cationic surfactant in the surfactant blend leads to less stable emulsion droplets when in the presence of the serum proteins. The size of the droplets increase with the increasing cationic surfactant in the surfactant blend. This indicated that, in some embodiments, there may be an optimal size and/or concentration of cationic surfactant needed in the blend to create stable droplets in the presence of serum proteins. The Pdl follows the same trend; as the cationic surfactant is increased, the Pdl becomes larger. When the Pdl is larger than 0.3, bimodal and trimodel particle size distributions are present. The effect of the surfactant blend ratio (e.g. 1 :6, 1 : 1) in SAC/P407 compositions were also investigated in the bioload screening assay. The SAC/P407 composition with a 1 :6 ratio was stable in all serum levels. The 1 : 1 composition was stable up to 50% serum level. This was the first time a 1 : 1 surfactant blend ratio was stable at higher serum levels. While an understanding of a mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention, and while the invention is not limited to any particular mechanism, in some embodiments, increased stability is attributed to the longer carbon tail stabilizing the interface of the nanoemulsion droplets in combination with P407. The SAC/P407 formulations are unimodal in particle size distribution. However, the SAC/Tween 20 compositions have bimodal distribution upon manufacturing. In particular, studies performed during development of embodiments of the invention showed that the SAC/Tween 20 compositions may be more stable than indicated by the change in mean size since the mean particle size accounts for both populations. The main peak in the size profile was around (550nm) with a small peak around 5000 nm. Therefore, when a bimodal distributions of a nanoemulson of the invention is observed, identifying a corresponding Pdl profile may be more informative (e.g., than other measured nanoemulsion characteristics) with regard to nanoemulsion biophysical properties (e.g., stability in serum). The SAC/Tween 20 at 1 : 1 ratio appeared to be less stable at the 50% serum level. The SAC/Tween 20 remained relatively unimodal and constant, indicating stability in serum. Zeta potential data obtained during development of embodiments of the invention was surprising. The formulation with the highest amount of cationic surfactant, 6: 1, resulted in the highest zeta potential before the addition of the serum proteins. The 1 : 1 surfactant blend has less positive surface charge than the 6: 1 blend. The 1 :6 surfactant blend ratio resulted in positivity charged droplets but with the lowest zeta potential. The surface charge density is illustrated in FIG. 26. With the addition of serum proteins, all the formulations decreased in zeta potential, presumably due to complexion of the proteins with the positively charged nanoemulsion droplets. However, the 1 :6 had the lowest decrease from 14.1 in water to 11.3 at the highest serum protein loading, while, the 6: 1 resulted in the largest drop in zeta potential, 26.7 in water to 6 with the highest serum protein level. This indicated either an aggregation or destruction of nanoemulsion droplets when mixed with serum protein to form larger droplets with less overall positive surface charge. This event would lead to a reduction in the overall zeta potential. The effect of the cationic surfactant was investigated. CPC or DODAC were formulated with Tween 20 at a surfactant blend ratio (cationic/nonionic) of 1 :6 with 20 mM EDTA. The initial sizes of the nanoemulsion droplets were different. The particle size of CPC/Tween 20 was -180 nm, while DODAC/Tween 20 was -550 nm. It appeared that the CPC/Tween 20 formulation was more stable with higher serum protein concentration as compared to DODAC/Tween 20 with respect to mean particle size and Pdl. The decreases in zeta potential were similar. The effect of the nonionic surfactant was investigated. CPC was formulated at a 1 :6 surfactant blend ratio (cationic:nonionic) with Tween 20 or P407. Table 3 shows a comparison between the chemistry of Tween 20 and P407. The mean particle size of the droplets of the Tween 20 and P407 were similar. Both formulations were stable at the serum protein levels tested. The zeta potential showed that the Tween 20 formulation had a higher overall zeta potential as compared to the P407 formulation. Also, the decrease was relatively stable for both formulations (Tween 20 14 to 11, P407 2 to 2). Since an overall positive surface charge of the nanoemulsion is highly desirable for killing, it was apparent that the P407 nonionic surfactant shielded the charge of CPC. As shown in Table 3, P407 has two very large polar head groups that would shield the charge. In some embodiments, low surface coverage of hydrophilic chains leads to a configuration where most chains are located closer to the particle surface (more protein bind at the surface). In the high surface coverage, the lack of mobility of the hydrophilic chains leads to a configuration where most of the chains are extended away from the surface (restrict binding of proteins to the surface) and also shielding the positive charge of CPC. Results from benzalkonium chloride (BAC) formulation bioloading study are shown in Figure 37. The benzalkonium chloride/tween 20 surfactant blend ratio was 1/3 with 20 mM EDTA in the external aqueous phase. The BAC formulation was stable with respect to mean particle size and Pdl in 25% human serum. The zeta potential of the formulation decreased as the percent of human serum increased and retained its positive charge. Example 2 Nanoemulsion and Telfa Absorption and Compatibility Study Several of the nanoemulsions generated and initially characterized in Example 1 were utilized for further analysis. Stability and compatibility of nanoemulsion with TELFA pad wound dressing was assessed. Experiments were conducted to determine stability and compatibility with TELFA for in vivo animal wound and burn models. TELFA (Kendall Co., Mansfield, MA) and TEGADERM HP (3M Health Care, St Paul, MN) were applied to prevent wound contamination and were used as a dressing in the in vivo experiments. Nanoemulsions tested are shown in Tables 10 and 11. The burn wound was then redressed with TELFA and a TEGADERM occlusive dressing. The treatment and dressing change was repeated once, at 22 hours after bum injury. Experiments were designed to determine the maximum absorption of the nanoemulsions, shown in Table 11, in a TELFA pad and the stability of the nanoemulsion formulations over time in contact with the TELFA pad. Briefly, TELFA was cut into 6cm x 6cm areas and the weights recorded. The nanoemulsions (Table 11) were applied separately in excess and allowed to achieve maximum absorption in the TELFA and the weights of the saturated TELFA pad were recorded. The stability conditions were 10 minutes at room temperature (~25°C), 2 hours at 35°C, 4 hours at 35°C, and 12 hours at 35°C. The nanoemulsion was extracted by squeezing the TELFA pad, followed by transfer of the nanoemulsion to a glass vial. The weight of each vial was measured and recorded. The sample analysis included: observation of physical appearance; measuring pH: particle size analysis (mean Z-average, Pdl); %CPC or BAK (label claim); and % EDTA (label claim). The specific experimental procedure for TELFA stability study was as follows: 1. Place petri dish and petri dish cover on balance and record weight. 2. Cut a Telfa in 6cm x 6cm square and place into petri dish; cover and record weight. Subtract weight of petri dish from the weight of petri dish plus Telfa to obtain the weight of the Telfa alone. 3. Place 10 mL of nanoemulsion into petri dish. Record the total weight. 4. Incubate the Telfa with the 10 mL of nanoemulsion for the following duration and temperatures: • 10 minutes at 25°C • 4 hours at 37°C* • 12 hours at 37°C* *Parafilm the edges of the petri dish when incubation time is longer than 10 minutes. 5. Remove Telfa from the petri dish and carefully remove excess nanoemulsion with a Kim wipe. 6. Weigh a new, clean petri dish and place the soaked Telfa in the dish and record the weight. To determine the maximum amount absorbed, subtract the petri dish weight from the total weight (with soaked Telfa). 7. Remove the non-absorbed nanoemulsion retained in the petri dish and place in 20 mL glass vial. 8. Weigh a 20mL glass scintillation vial 9. Carefully squeeze at the nanoemulsion out of the Telfa using tongs, into scintillation vial. Record the weight of the nanoemulsion extracted. 10. Determine the following from the extracted nanoemulsion, non-absorbed nanoemulsion, and control nanoemulsion for the following: pH, particle size profile (mean Z-average, Pdl, Dv 10, Dv 50, Dv 90), % CPC, % EDTA or % BAC. As shown in Tables 12, 13 and 14, the nanoemulsion formulations tested were stable with respect to particle size, pH and% label claim for BAK or CPC and EDTA up to 12 hours at 35°C (typical surface temperature of the skin). Surprisingly, there was no binding of BAK, CPC or EDTA to the TELFA pad. In Tables 12, 13 and 14, "*" indicated a recorded observation that the nanomeulsion appeared both a white and homogenous matter. *=CPC potency adjusted for water content in the monohydrate Table 10.

Stability and compatibility of vehicle To achieve a target dosing volume per surface area of skin of 100μΕ/αη2, 3.6mL (3600μΕ) was sprayed over the skin surface area using a template to achieve a 100μ1/αη2 to the wound area. The maximum amount absorbed by the TELFA pad was approximately 6mL, and squeezing the TELFA pad released about 50%>, leaving 3 mL trapped inside the TELFA pad. This data indicated that at least around 3mL of formulation should be applied to the 6cm x 6cm TELFA pad to prevent wicking away of the sprayed nanoemulsion from the wound area. New cream nanoemulsion formulations The liquid formulation was amenable to application with a sprayer (e.g., for immediate treatment after injury). Further experiments were performed in an effort to determine if additional formulations (e.g., cream formulations) could be generated for use in covering a wound (e.g., prior to application of a dressing, bandage or other covering). One formulation strategy tested for cream nanoemulsion formulations was to assess the effect that different cationic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants and the surfactant blend ratio have on stability. In previous experiments, the surfactant blend ratio had been determined to participate in cytotoxicity properties of the nanoemulsions. In vitro findings also indicated that the concentration of the cationic surfactant was also a factor of cytotoxicity. Thus, experiments were conducted to determine if the surfactant blend ratio could be altered and utilized to generate effective cream nanoemulsion formulations. A 10% nanoemulsion concentration was compared to 80% nanoemulsion at varying surfactant blend ratios as described in Table 15, below. As shown in Table 15, a 10% nanoemulsion formulation with a surfactant blend ratio of 1/3 was compared to an 80% NE formulation with a surfactant blend ratio of 1/24. The 10% nanoemulsion formulation with a surfactant blend ratio of 1/3 has a cationic surfactant concentration similar to the 80% nanoemulsion with a surfactant blend ratio of 1/24, roughly 0.2% BAK. These formulations displayed different mean particle sizes and number of nanoemulsion droplets (See Table 16). It was also determined that nanoemulsions with larger mean droplet sizes contain fewer numbers of droplets as compared to nanoemulsions with smaller mean droplet sizes at the same %BAK (See Table 16). However, when the % nanoemulsion was increased the total surface area of droplets increased by almost 9 fold. While and understanding of a mechanism of action is not needed to practice the present invention, and while the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism of action, in some embodiments, an increase in the total surface area of nanoemulsion droplets impacts the biological/biophysical properties of the nanoemulsion (e.g., an increase in the total surface area of the nanoemulsion droplet increases the ability of the nanoemulsion to inhibit the progression of a partial thickness burn wound to a full thickness burn wound and/or or increases the anti-microbial properties of the nanoemulsion when applied to a surface (e.g., a burn wound surface)). Total 100.00% 100.00% 100% *50mM EDTA Table 15. Comparison of the composition of the liquid and cream formulations of NB-201. Table 16. Comparison of liquid and cream Formulations ofNB-201 : Surfactant blend ratio, concentration of cationic surfactant, particle size and number of droplets/mL. Several of the nanoemulsion formulations described and characterized herein were oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion with a mean droplet diameter ranging from 180 to 260 nm. Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) are cationic surfactants that both reside at the interface between the oil and water phases. The hydrophobic tail of the surfactant distributes in the oil core and its polar cationic head group resides in the water phase. The corresponding placebo formulations without the cationic surfactant ranged in particle size from 360-490 nm. Thus, removing the cationic surfactant affected the particle size of the droplets. Benzalkonium chloride is used as a preservative in pharmaceuticals and personal care products such as eye, ear and nasal drops. The greatest biocidal activity is associated with the C12 dodecyl and C14 myristyl alkyl derivatives. The mechanism of bactericidal/microbicidal action is thought to cause dissociation of cellular membrane lipid bilayers, which compromises cellular permeability controls and induces leakage of cellular contents. Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) is a cationic quaternary ammonium compound in some types of mouthwashes, toothpastes, lozenges, throat sprays, breath sprays, and nasal sprays. It is an antiseptic that kills bacteria and other microorganisms. From data accumulated during development of embodiments of the invention, the BAC formulation (NB-201) outperformed the CPC based (NB-402) formulation with respect to killing bacteria. While an understanding of a mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention, and while the invention is not limited to any particular mechanism, in some embodiments, this is attributed to the varying chain lengths of BAC. BAC has 4 chain lengths and the length of each chain affects bacterium differently. The percentage of chain lengths used was: C12 (5%); C14 (60%); C16 (30%); C18 (5%). For example, C12 was best for killing fungi; C14 for gram (+); C16 for gram (-). CPC has a chain length of C16 (100%) in comparison. Also, the amount of cationic BAC used was a total of 0.2% for BAC, in comparison to 0.1% for CPC. The size of the droplets was similar for both formulations containing BAC or CPC. Thus, as described herein, removing the cationic surfactant from the composition had a significant effect on the killing of bacteria. Example 3 Antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsion formulations Experiments were performed in order to test the microbicidal activity of nanoemulsion formulations described herein against a wide range of bacteria. Table 17. Comparison of the Composition of the Liquid and Cream Formulations of NB-201 containing BAK Table 18. Comparison of Lotion and Cream Formulations of NB-201 and NB-402: Surfactant Blend Ratio, Concentration of Cationic Surfactant and Particle Size. Table 19. Comparison of liquid and cream Formulations ofNB-201 : Surfactant blend ratio, concentration of cationic surfactant, particle size and number of droplets/mL The MICs of NB-201 lotion, cream and control were determined by using a modification of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)-approved microtiter serial dilution method (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. 2006. Methods for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically. Approved standard M7-A7, 7th ed. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, Wayne, PA.). The formulations were diluted to a concentration of 2 mg/ml (of CPC) in MH broth supplemented with 7% NaCl and 20 mM EDTA. Serial twofold dilutions of this preparation were made in unsupplemented MH broth and aliquoted into 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (100 μΐ/well). Bacteria from overnight growth on MH agar were suspended in MH broth to a 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard (absorbance of 0.08 to 0.13 at 625 nm), further diluted 1 : 100 in MH broth, and added (5 μΐ/well) to the formulations serial dilution wells. Appropriate controls, including wells with bacteria but no formulation and wells with formulations dilutions but no bacteria, were included on each plate. Microtiter plates were shaken briefly, and 1 μΐ was removed from wells containing bacteria but no NB-401, diluted in 1 ml of MH broth, plated onto MH agar (100 μΐ), and incubated for 24 to 48 h at 37°C to confirm that initial inoculums were >105 CFU. Microtiter plates were then incubated at 37°C without shaking. To determine minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), 10 μΐ was removed from each well after overnight growth, spread onto MH agar, and incubated at 37°C. Colonies were enumerated 24 h later, and MBCs were recorded as the formulation concentrations with a 3-log decrease in CFU/ml compared to the initial inoculums. Because the formulations are opaque, 10 μΐ of resazurin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to each well, and microtiter plates were shaken briefly, covered with foil, and incubated at 37°C without shaking. Resazurin, a nonfluorescing blue dye, is reduced to resorufin, a fluorescing pink dye, in the presence of actively metabolizing cells. Therefore, MICs were recorded the next day as the lowest concentrations of formulations in which the wells remained blue. MIC results were further quantified by measuring the fluorescence generated by the reduction product resorufin on a spectrofluorometer at 560 nm excitation/590 nm emission. The change in metabolic activity for treated bacteria was calculated as follows: (fluorescence of the visual MIC well - fluorescence of the well with the equivalent concentration of the formulations without bacteria)/(fluorescence of the well containing bacteria but no formulation - fluorescence of the well containing medium only) x 100 (See, e.g., Taneja and Tyagi. 2007. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 60:288-293.). Table 20 summarizes the antimicrobial activity of BAC/P407 against 21 strains representing five species. Example 4 Bacterial wound infection and partial- thickness burn injury studies in rats Materials and methods. Reagents. Nanoemulsions described in Example 1 above (NB-201 , NB-402 and NB- 402 placebo; Table 10) were manufactured by and obtained from NANOBIO Corporation (Ann Arbor, MI). Two different cationic surfactants were used in the rat burn model. Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was the cationic surfactant incorporated into the NB-201 formulation with Tween 20 as the nonionic surfactant (See Example 1). Cetylpyridium chloride (CPC) was the cationic surfactant incorporated into the NB-402 formulation with Poloxamer 407 (P407) as the nonionic surfactant (See Example 1). The nanoemulsion vehicle (NE vehicle) was prepared in a similar fashion, without incorporation of any cationic surfactant and P407 as the nonionic surfactant. The surfactants, both cationic and nonionic, reside at the interface between the oil and water phases. The hydrophobic tail of the surfactant distributes in the oil core and its polar head group resides in the water phase. Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were purchased from SIGMA-ALDRICH (St. Louis, MO). Animals. Male specific pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing approximately 250 to 300 g were used. The experiment was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for care and use of animals. Approval for the experimental protocol was obtained from the University of Michigan Animal Care and Use Committee. Burn model. Rats were anesthetized with a 40 mg/kg intraperitoneal (ip) injection of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal; ABBOTT Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Dorsal hair was closely clipped and then removed using depilatory cream (NAIR; Church & Dwight Inc., Princeton, NJ). Partial-thickness scald burn injury of 20% of the total body surface area was achieved by placing the exposed skin of the rat in a 60°C water bath for 25 seconds. An occlusive dressing of sterile TELFA (Kendall Co., Mansfield, MA) and TEGADERM HP (3M HealthCare, St Paul, MN) was applied to prevent wound contamination. During experiments, each rat was singly housed and received 0.01 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously at the time of burn and at 8h, 16h and 24h for post-burn for pain control. Local wound treatment. Each experimental group underwent burn followed by bacterial innoculation. At 6 hours after burn injury, animals were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane. The occlusive dressing and TELFA was removed. NB-201, NB-402, vehicle control or sterile saline was applied in a uniform fashion to the burn wound surface using a spray bottle. The burn wound was then redressed with TELFA and a TEGADERM occlusive dressing. This treatment and dressing change was repeated at 14 and 22 hours after burn injury (Figure Model 1). In a separate set of experiments, we studied burn wound healing. Experimental groups consisted of burn wound only without bacterial innoculation. + saline, burn + vehicle controle, burn + NB-201, and burn + NB-402. The occlusive dressing and Telfa were changed at 8h, 16h, 24h, 36h and 48h (Figure Model 2). Pictures were taken at the time of each dressing change. Tissue harvest. At 30 or 72 hours after thermal injury, the animals were euthanized, and skin tissue samples were harvested employing standard sterile techniques. Skin samples were used immediately or frozen in liquid nitrogen. Quantitation of bacterial wound infection. A 100 mg piece of excised skin tissue was mechanically homogenized in 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl. This homogenate was then further diluted with 9 mL of sterile saline. Serial dilutions were performed, and skin homogenates were plated in triplicate on blood agar plates (Becton Dickinson). Culture plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C, and CFUs counted. Quantitation of soluble mediators by ELISA. A 100 mg piece of excised skin tissue was mechanically homogenized in 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl containing 0.01% of Triton X (Roche) and complete protease inhibitors cocktail (Complete X, ROCHE, Indianapolis, IN). This homogenate was then centrifuged at 3000g for 5minutes at +4°C and used for ELISA. Rat cytokines and chemokines were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using DUOSETS from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Rat myeloperoxidase ELISA kit was from Hycult biotech (Plymouth Meeting, PA). For rat MPO assay, skin tissue was homogenized in 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl containing complete protease inhibitors cocktail (ROCHE). Histology. Fresh 4mm full thickness skin tissue biopsies were fixed in 10%> buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections 4μιη thick were sliced and affixed to slides, deparaffmized, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess morphological changes. To evaluate neutrophil infiltration into the burn wound we counted neutrophils within a 1mm xlmm microscope grid at high power (40x magnification) for six fields per slide of full thickness skin and an average value of cells/mm3 was determined for each burn wound sample. Skin histology samples were scored for burn injury by an independent and blinded pathologist using the following system: distribution of cellular infiltrate (0=none, l=focal, 2= multifocal, 3=locally extensive, 4=multifocal and locally extensive, 5=diffuse), inflammation severity (0=none, l=mild, 2= moderate, 3=severe), infiltrate type (0=none, l=acute, 2= subacute, 3=chronic), necrosis (0=none, l=minimal, 2=moderate, 3= severe). A final score was computed by summing the scores in each subdivision. Statistical methods. All statistical analysis and graph(s) were performed using GRAPHPAD Prism software (version 5.0; GRAPHPAD Software, La JoUa, CA). Results are presented as mean values ± the SEM unless otherwise noted. Continuous variables were analyzed using 1 way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls multiple comparison. Statistical significance was defined as a P value < .05. Results. Nanoemulsion treatment reduces dermal P. aeruginosa infection As shown in FIG. 1, topical application of NB-402 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth in burn wounds. Spray application of nanoemulsions resulted in profound suppression of bacteria load. There was minimal pathogen growth in all NB-201 treated animals. A majority of the control (9/9) and vehicle (7/9) animals with burn injury had evidence of wound infection based on a positive quantitative wound culture with significantly more bacteria present in the wound than those animals treated with NB-402. In the clinical setting, a quantitative culture is considered to be positive when growth of more than 1 x 105 of organisms per gram of wound tissue is documented. NB-402 treatment after partial thickness burn injury and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection decreased production of dermal proinflammatory cytokines (See FIG. 2). Groups were burn+bacteria+saline, burn+bacteria+ NB-402 placebo or burn+bacteria+NB-402. * P< .05, the one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test.

Groups were burn+bacteria+saline, burn+bacteria+ NB-402 placebo or burn+bacteria+NB- 201 and burn+bacteria+NB-402. * P< .05, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test. NB-201 and NB-402 treatment after partial thickness burn injury and Staphylococcus aureus infection decreased dermal neutrophil sequestration as evidenced by myeloperoxidase assay (See FIG. 6) * P< .05, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test. FIG. 7 shows photographic (A-H) and cross-sectional histology (I-L) analysis of burn skin, in absence of infection, after treatment with saline, placebo or NB-201 or NB-402. Photographic analysis (A-H) of Saline (A and E) and Placebo (B and F) treated rats demonstrate accentuated fibrosis and granulation tissue formation. Nanoemulsions treatment significantly reduced burn wound progression in NB-402 (C and G) and NB-201 (D and H) treated rats. Histological analysis (FIG. 7, I-L), hematoxylin and eosin stain, original magnification x 60, revealed loss of epidermis in Saline (I) and Placebo (J) treated groups and intact epidermis in NB-402 (K) and NB-201 (L) treated groups. Groups were Saline (saline treated), Placebo (NB-402 placebo treated), NB-201 (NB-201 treated) and NB-402 (NB-402 treated). Rats that received nanoemulsions (NB-201 or NB-402) experienced less discomfort compared to saline or placebo groups. Saline and placebo treated groups demonstrated significant scar formation compared to almost no scars on nanoemulsions treated rats. The NB-201 or NB-402 treated skin demonstrated no signs of fibrosis formation and appeared just like normal uninjured skin at the time of harvest at 72 hours post burn. Levels of dermal cytokines measured in skin homogenates were lower in the non- infected burn wounds as compared to those in burn wounds inoculated with bacteria (FIG. 8A). Despite this, significantly decreased levels of IL-Ιβ and TNF-a were observed in burned skin for both NB-201 and NB-402 treated animals compared to the saline and NE vehicle groups. Chemokine levels (CXCL1 and CXCL2) were reduced for NB-201 and NB- 402 treated animals compared to the saline group. Once again, NB-201 and NB-402 treatment significantly diminished myeloperoxidase levels as compared to controls. Histopathologic counting of neutrophils present in skin samples demonstrated a reduced infiltration of neutrophils into the burned skin treated with NB- 201 and NB-402 vs. the saline or NE vehicle treated animals (FIG. 8B). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the invention provides that treatment with NB-201 or NB-402 or other formulation described herein may be utilized to lessen dermal neutrophil recruitment and sequestration into the burn wound. Evaluation of skin samples with a histopathology scoring system revealed significantly less burn injury at 72 hours after treatment with NB-201 or NB-402 compared to saline treated controls (See FIG. 9A). The NB-201 or NB-402 treated rats also maintained their pre-burn injury measured body weight, whereas the saline or NE vehicle treated animals lost body mass over the 72 hours of treatment (See FIG. 9B). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the invention provides nanoemulsion formulations and methods of using the same to reduce burn wound progression (e.g., of burn wound depth (e.g., as evidenced by elimination of histologic changes that occur in control and/or non-treated subjects)). Although an understanding of a mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention, and while the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism, in one embodiment, the invention provides that the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of nanoemulsion formulations of the invention are distinct and separate from its antimicrobial activity (e.g., since anti-inflammatory effects were observed in sterile burn wounds). Example 5 Porcine burn wound progression and healing experiments Materials and Methods. Animal Ethics and Care. All experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animal work was reviewed and approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA). Four commercially obtained Yorkshire-Landrace swine weighing between 20 and 30kg (Michigan State University Swine Teaching and Resource Center; Lansing, MI) were acclimated for at least seven days before the start of the experiments. Animals were housed individually in enriched cages with water provided ad libitum. Animals were fed a standard porcine diet (Lab Diet 5801; PMI Nutrition, IN) in accordance with University of Michigan Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine guidelines. Anesthesia Induction. Animals were fasted overnight prior to anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with intramuscular (IM) injection of 2.5-3mg/kg tiletamine/zolazepam (Telazol; Zoetis Inc, Kalamazoo, MI) and 2.2mg/kg xylazine and was maintained with isoflurane administered via face mask. Animals were placed in sternal recumbency for the duration of the procedure. Heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature and venous oxygen saturation were monitored at regular intervals. Additional heat support was provided as necessary with a circulating water blanket. Post-procedure analgesia was provided with injectable buprenorphine and a Butrans transdermal system (Purdue Pharma L.P., Stamford, CT) for systemic delivery of 5mcg per hour buprenorphine for 7 days. A single loading dose of 0.01 mg/kg buprenorphine was administered intramuscularly immediately following burn trauma and again on days 7, 10, 14 and 18 to control post punch biopsy pain. A Butrans transdermal patch system was applied following the loading dose of injectable buprenorphine and was maintained for one week. Swine were monitored twice daily for evidence of pain. If necessary, additional analgesics were administered under veterinary supervision. Swine Burn Model. Dorsal hair was removed using depilatory cream (Nair; Church & Dwight Inc., Princenton, NJ) and any remaining hair was clipped. The skin was prepped with chlorhexidine scrub. A square 5x5cm copper block (wt 530g) with an attached positioning rod was pre-heated in an 80°C water bath for 30 minutes prior to application to the skin. The block was applied to 10 paralumbar sites for a duration of 20 or 30 seconds per site. The block was returned to temperature in the water bath between burns. Pressure was supplied by gravity. An occlusive dressing of sterile TELFA (Kendall Co., Mansfield, MA) and TEGADERM HP (3M HealthCare, St Paul, MN) was applied to prevent wound contamination. A clean laparotomy pad was placed over the TEGADERM to minimize adhesion of the top dressing to TEGADERM. The thorax was covered with self-adherent wrap (MEDICHOISE, Buford, GA) and the ends secured with heavyweight stretch tape (BSN medical, Inc., Charlotte, NC). A cloth jacket (MWI Veterinary Supply Inc., Rochester Hills, MI) was placed over the dressing to prevent fecal contamination. Topical Burn Wound Treatment and Evaluation. Swine were anesthetized during each dressing change. The burn sites were treated with saline, SILVADENE or NB-201 (10%, 20% or 40% Table 21). Nanoemulsion formulation NB-201 was obtained from NanoBio Corporation (Ann Arbor, MI). 5ml of NB-201 was applied in a uniform fashion to the burn wound surface using a spray bottle (Mistette MK 140-T; MeadWestvaco Calmar GmbH, Germany, from a 6mL U-Save Type 1 glass vial (Neville & More, W)). For the NB- 201 or saline treated groups, a 6X6 cm TELFA square was soaked with 5ml of NB-201 or saline. For the SILVADENE treated wounds, SILVADENE cream (0.8ml/Telfa) was applied to a 6 X 6 cm TELFA square. TEGADERM was then applied over TELFA squares. Dressing changes were performed on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 18 after burn injury. The 4mm full thickness skin tissue punch biopsies were performed on days 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, and 21 after burn injury. Digital pictures were taken at the time of each dressing change to monitor healing progression. Animals were euthanized at 21 days post burn. lii'ii/nlkniiium Emulsifying 0.200 0.400 0.800 ( liloridi U SP) agent, Total 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% Table 21. Composition of NB-201 (BAC/Tween 20) *50mM EDTA Nanoemulsion Formulation. The nanoemulsions (NB-201) were prepared by emulsification of a cationic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, ethanol, a chelating agent, soybean oil, and water Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was the cationic surfactant incorporated into the NB-201 formulation with Tween 20 as the nonionic surfactant (See Table 21). These formulations are composed of pharmaceutically approved ingredients that are included on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Inactive Ingredient List for Approved Drug benzalkonium chloride (BAC), the cationic surfactant incorporated in NB- 201 is composed of various carbon chain lengths as following: 60% of C 14, 30%> of C 16, 5% of C12, 5% of C 18. The final concentrations of BAC in the compositions are as follows: 10% NB-201 is 0.2% BAC, 20% NB-201 is 0.4% BAC and 40% NB-201 is 0.8% BAC. The surfactants, both cationic and nonionic, reside at the interface between the oil and water phases. The hydrophobic tail of the surfactant distributes in the oil core and its polar head group resides in the water phase. Mean particle size (Z-average) and polydispersity index (Pdl) were determined for each nanoemulsion formulation. The particle size and Pdl of the sample was measured by photon correlation spectroscopy using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). All size measurements were carried out at 25°C using disposable methyl methacrylate cells after appropriate dilution with 0.22μιη filtered deionized distilled water. Tissue Harvest. At the selected time point after thermal injury the animals were euthanized and skin tissue samples were harvested using 4mm full thickness punch biopsies and sterile technique. Skin samples were used immediately or frozen in liquid nitrogen. Quantitation of Bacterial Wound Infection. A 4mm full thickness punch biopsies were mechanically homogenized in 1 mL of sterile saline solution. This homogenate was then further diluted with 9 mL of sterile saline solution. Serial dilutions were performed, and skin homogenates were plated in triplicate on blood agar plates (Becton Dickinson). Culture plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C and CFUs were counted. Quantitation of Soluble Mediators by ELISA. 4mm full thickness skin tissue biopsies were mechanically homogenized in 1 mL of sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline (IX), pH 7.4, containing 0.01% (w/v) Triton X (Roche) and complete protease inhibitors cocktail (Complete X, Roche, Indianapolis, IN). This homogenate was then centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C and used for sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pig interleukin 1-beta (IL-Ιβ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) were measured by ELISA using DuoSets from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Pig myeloperoxidase ELISA kit was from TZS ELISA (Ellison Park, MA). Results were expressed as picograms per milliliter (pg/mL). Histology. Fresh 4mm full thickness skin tissue punch biopsies were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections 4μιη thick were sliced and affixed to slides, deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess morphological changes. Skin histology samples were scored by two independent and double-blinded veterinary pathologists using the following scoring system: epidermis (0=complete, l=acute necrosis, 2=separation, 3=absent), dermal necrosis, necrotic inflammation, immature granulation tissue (0=none, 1= < 100 μιη, 2= 100 - 300 μιη, 3= 300 - 500 μιη, 4 = > 500 μιη), perivascular inflammation (0=none, l=mild multifocal, 2= moderate multufocal, 3=mild diffuse, 4=moderate diffuse, 5=severe), deep granulation tissue (0 = none, 1 = < 500 μιη, 2 = 500-1000 μιη, 3 = 1000-3000 μιη, 4 = 3000-5000 μιη, 5 = > 5000 μιη). A final score was computed by summing the scores in each category. Statistical Methods. All statistical analysis and graph(s) were performed using GRAPHPAD Prism software, version 5.0 (GRAPHPAD Software, La JoUa, CA). Results are presented as mean values ± the standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise noted. Continuous variables were analyzed using a 1 way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newman-Keuls multiple comparison. Statistical significance was defined as a P value < 0.05. Results. NB-201 limits burn wound progression in a sterile partial thickness wounds. As described above, ten sites on the back of each pig were utilized as a scald burn site. A 5x5cm copper block weighing 530g was heated to 80°C in a water bath and then applied to the burn site for 20 or 30 seconds using the weight of the block to provide consistent pressure across sites. This was repeated for each of the 10 predetermined sites on the pig. This regimen has been shown to result in full thickness injury and heals with significant scarring and wound contracture at sites treated with saline (See . Singer et al, J Burn Care Res 2011;32:638-646). Pigs received a topical application of saline, silvadene and NB-201 immediately following partial thickness burn trauma. Dressing change were performed at days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 18. Digital photographs were taken to document macroscopic healing. The burn wounds treated with saline or silvadene progressed to full thickness burns by day 7, as confirmed by histopathologic evaluation, with heavy crust formation by day 14. The NB-201 treated burns had no evidence of progression toward full thickness burns (See FIGS. 16A and 16B). Macroscopic healing was achieved by day 21 post burn (see FIGS. 16A and 16B). Treatment with saline or silvadene was associated with healing by fibrosis, wound contracture and delayed healing in the wound center. In all wounds treated with NB-201 complete healing with new skin formation without scar tissue formation or skin contraction was achieved by the day 21 post burn. NB-201 treated wounds were grossly and histologically healed on the day 21 (SEE FIG 16C). Silvadene treated wounds were not healed by day 21 and significant leukocytic infiltration was noted. Macroscopic and histopathologic appearance of wounds induced by exposure to 80°C heated copper bar for 20 seconds or 30 seconds was not different. Both time settings resulted in very similar partial thickness wounds which progressed to full thickness wounds by day 7 unless NB-201 treated. Accordingly, in some embodiments, nanoemulsions of the invention is utilized to prevent burn wound progression (e.g., from partial thickness to full thickness wound). In other embodimens, nanoemulsion of the invention is utilized to stimulate, promote and/or generate re-epithelialization (e.g., complete re-epithelialization) of a burn wound and/or to prevent scarring resulting from a burn trauma (e.g., that is not prevented using conventional treatment (e.g., SILVADENE). While an understanding of a mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention, and while the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism, in some embodiments, nanoemulsion formulations of the invention significantly suppress neutrophil activity after burn injury (e.g., compared to controls (e.g., saline and SILVADENE treated wounds)) and/or significantly suppress inflammation after burn injury (e.g., compared to controls (e.g., saline and SILVADENE treated wounds)). NB-201 suppresses production of inflammatory mediators in wounds. IL-1 signalling is an essential mediator of postoperative incisional pain (See, e.g., Wolf et al., BrainBehav Immun 2008; 22: 1072-7) and inflammatory hyperalgesia (See, e.g., Binshtok et al., J. Neurosci 2008; 28: 14062-73) and can also contribute to the development of chronic pain syndrome (See, e.g., Review by Wolf et al, Pharmacol Ther 2006; 112: 116-38). In-vitro stimulation of primary human keratinocytes with IL-1 resulted in production of large amounts of CXC chemokines (e.g., GRO-a and IL-8) production. Soluble mediator production was quantified from punch biopsies obtained from wounds on days 4, 7, 10, 14, 18 and 21. In most groups, significant changes were found at days 4, 7, 14 and 21. Application of NB-201 at days 0, 1, 2 and 4 significantly reduced wound levels of IL-1 β, IL-6 and IL-8 compared to silvadene treated control. The level of IL- 1β compared to silvadene was suppressed on day 4 with 10%, 20% and 40%> NB-201 by 12 fold, 11 fold and 14.6 fold (240.7±139.0, silvadene vs 19.7±17.3, 21.7±14.8 and 16.4±7.6, p<0.0001) in the partial thickness wounds created by 80°C heated blocks and applied to the skin for 20 seconds (See FIG. 17A). The intense phase of NB-201 application within first week after burn trauma was followed by every 3-4 days dressing changes, leading to minor increase in IL-lb production: only silvadene vs 40% NB-201 difference was statistically significant (132.4±90.2 vs 32.4±18.8, 4.1 fold decrease, p=0.004) on day 7 (See FIG 17A). Continued inflammation was still present in silvadene and saline treated wounds on the day21 while NB-201 treated wounds were healed and very low production of IL-1 β was found: silvadene vs 10%, 20% and 40% NB-201 was 94.6±39.9 vs 10.6±5.3, 9.4±5.5 and 14.2±9.9 correspondingly with 8.9, 10.1 and 6.7 fold suppression, p<0.0001. The changed in the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 production were similar to the trend described for the IL-Ι β, reaching significant difference between control(s) and NB-201 at days 4 (p=0.001, IL-6 and p<0.0001, IL-8) and 21 (p<0.0001, both IL-6 and IL-8, See FIG. 17A). Very similar trend of wound- associated soluble mediators production was found within partial thickness wounds created by 80°C heated blocks and applied to the skin for 30 seconds (See FIG. 17B ). The IL-Ιβ production was significantly suppressed by NB-201 treatment at days 4 (p<0.0001), 14 (p=0.0003) and 21 (p<0.0001) compared to silvadene treated control (See FIG. 17B). Production of IL-6 and IL-8 was reduced as well by NB-201 application and was significant between all groups on the day21 in case of IL-6 (p<0.0001, FIG. 17B). NB-201 suppresses the growth of pathogenic organisms in burn wounds. Significant bacterial contamination of both saline and silvadene treated burns was noted by days 18-21 post burn (See FIG. 18). Isolates included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp., enteric gram negative rods (not Pseudomonas spp. and non-pathogenic Cory b acterium spp. Bacteria were not cultured from NB-201 treated burns at any time point. Histopathologic examination. Wound histopathology was independently examined by blinded veterinary pathologists. Parameters of epidermis, presence of dermal necrosis and necrotic inflammation, perivascular inflammation, superficial dermal inflammation and immature and deep granulation tissue were analyzed. Total histopathologic score was calculated by summing all above parameters. Biopsies were collected at days 4, 7, 10, 14, 18 and 21. NB-201 limited damage to epidermis over the entire course of the study, reaching significance over saline treated control at day 21 (NB-201 20% and 40% vs saline, 0.4±0.8 and 0.3±0.9 vs 2.4±0.9, p<0.0001; See FIG. 19). On the day 21, superficial dermal inflammation was suppressed by 40%> NB-201 compared to silvadene treated wounds (0.7±0.5 vs 2.6±0.8, p=0.01). Necrosis was suppressed by application of 20%> NB-201 compared to silvadene treated wounds on day 10 (0.5±0.7 vs 2.8±1.1, p=0.04). Dermal necrosis was evident on day 4 and no difference between control and NB-201 treated wounds was noted until day 10. At day 10 post burn, dermal necrosis was reduced by all NB-201 formulations and was not evident on day 21 (score 0) at the sites treated with 20% and 40% NB-201. Formation of immature granulation tissue was not significantly different between groups until day 21 (Silvadene vs NB-201 40%, 3.4±0.7 vs 2.2±0.8, p=0.01). Deep granulation tissue formation was significantly reduced by 10, 20 and 40% NB-201 compared to saline control on day 4 (0±0, 0±0 and 0±0 vs 0.4±0.2, p<0.0001; See FIG. 19). On day 18, deep granulation tissue formation was significantly reduced by 20 and 40% NB-201 when compared to saline control (0.4±0.2 and 0.4±0.5 vs 3.2=1=1.5, p=0.005). On day 21, formation of deep granulation tissue was significantly reduced by application of 40%> NB-201 compared to saline or silvadene controls (1.4±0.5 vs 2.1±0.6 or 2.1±0.8, p=0.001; See FIG. 19). The total histopathologic scores were significantly different on 1) day 4 between saline or silvadene and 10% or 20% NB-201 (8.8±2.4 or 8.1±3 vs 3.4±0.7 or 2.9±0.9, p=0.001; See FIG. 19); 2) day 7 between saline treated control and 10% or 20% NB-201 treated wounds (12.8±1.5 vs 5±3.2 or 6.7±4, p<0.0001); 3) day 10 between silvadene and 20% NB-201 (16.9±1.5 vs 6.7±2.6, p=0.01); 4) day 18 between saline and 40% NB-201 (18.8±6.9 vs 4.7±1.9, p=0.01); 5) day 21 between saline or silvadene and 20% or 40% NB- 201 (11.8±4.4 or 12.6±3.6 vs 6.7±1.6 or 4.8±1.4, pO.0001; See FIG. 19). NB-201 inhibits neutrophilic sequestration (MPO assay). Neutrophilic sequestration associated with burn wound inflammation was significantly reduced by treatment with NB-201 compared to silvadene and saline controls on days 4 (p<0.0001) and 21 (p<0.0001, See FIG. 20A). Comparison of histopathologic scores of neutrophilic infiltration demonstrated reduced numbers of neutrophils in burned skin treated with NB-201 vs. the saline control or silvadene (See FIGS. 20A and 20B). NB-201 preserves hair follicles and facilitates hair re-growth following burns. Following burn wounds, necrosis of hair follicle after silvadene treatment was observed, whereas, surprisingly, proliferation of hair follicle cells was observed with NB-201 treatment (See FIG. 21). Proliferation of hair follicle cells in burns treated with NB-201 was very similar to normal hair follicle homeostasis depicted within normal, not burned skin (See FIG. 21). The number of hair follicles per histological sample were counted at day 21 post burn. Samples from Silvadene or saline treated wounds revealed no hair follicles whereas NB-201 treated sites demonstrated 3-6 hair follicles per slide (See FIG. 22).
