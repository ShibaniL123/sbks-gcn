Example 2: Preparation of 2-(2-phenylethoxyethyl)pyridine
2-(2-Phenylethoxyethyl)pyridine is prepared in a step according to the following reaction route.
60% sodium hydride (17.09 g, 420 mmol) and dry tetrahydrofuran (400 mL) were put in a one-L flask and stirred in a nitrogen atmosphere. In an ice bath, a dry tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) solution of 2-phenylethyl alcohol (47.48 g, 380 mmol) was dropwise added thereto at 30° C. or lower, taking 20 minutes, and then stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes. The reactor was again put in an ice bath, and a dry tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) solution of 2-vinylpyridine (49.00 g, 460 mmol) was dropwise added thereto at 30° C. or lower, taking 20 minutes, and heated under reflux for 1.5 hours after the addition.
The reaction liquid was cooled, then cold water (300 mL) was added thereto for quenching, and this was extracted with ethyl acetate (200 mL). The resultant organic layer was washed with 20% saline water (300 mL), dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated to give a crude product (139.76 g). This was distilled under reduced pressure to remove a major part of the unreacted raw materials, thereby giving a residue (13.13 g) containing the intended product. The residue was purified through silica gel chromatography to give 910 mg (purity 93.9%) of a fraction containing the intended, high-purity product. Further, this was purified using a Kugelrohr to give 781 mg (yield 0.9%, purity 98.6%) of 2-(2-phenylethoxyethyl)pyridine (invention product 2).
