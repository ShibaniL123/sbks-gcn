FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE [0002] Compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods disclosed herein are useful for treating viral infection, including RNA viral infection, in subjects. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE [0003] As a group, RNA viruses represent an enormous public health problem in the U.S. and worldwide. Well-known RNA viruses include influenza virus (including the avian and swine isolates; also referred to herein as flu), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Dengue virus (DNV), West Nile virus (WNV), SARS-coronavirus (SARS), MERS- coronavirus (MERS), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These viruses are responsible for pandemic outbreaks and threats to public health that have occurred throughout history. Fiaviviruses, Henipaviruses, Filoviruses, and Arenaviruses are among emerging RNA viruses that pose significant public health and biodefense threats. These viruses collectively place hundreds of millions of people at risk of infection throughout the world. Many of the emerging RNA viruses cause viral hemorrhagic fever and can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Dengue virus (DNV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are both Fiaviviruses (positive strand RNA virus) and Arboviruses, transmitted through mosquitoes; thus these viruses represent a potent potential biological threat through their ability to transmit readily among insects or animals and humans, high infectivity, and their potential to be weaponized in bioterror events. [0004] At least 4 subtypes of Ebola virus (EV) are infectious to humans (Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, and Cote d'lvoire). EV outbreaks have been described in Africa with a fatality rate of up to 90%. Feldmann, H., et al. (201 1 ) Lancet 49, 1-14. Cases of EV infection have been reported in other countries including, very recently, the United States. The natural host for EV is not defined, but nonhuman primates (NHP) are susceptible. EV is a negative-strand RNA virus of the Filoviridae and can be spread effectively from person-to-person. [0005] Seasonal flu infects 5 - 20% of the population annually, resulting in 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths. Influenza can precipitate viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia, and complicated disease in those at the extremes of age or with weakened immune systems. Coronaviruses are common throughout the world and typically cause mild to moderate respiratory illness, although certain coronaviruses cause severe respiratory illness and death. A 2003 multi-country outbreak of SARS- coronavirus infection resulted in approximately 8,000 infections and nearly 800 deaths. Recently there have been reported cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome caused by MERS-coronavirus. [0006] More than 170 million people worldwide are infected by HCV, and 130 million of these are chronic carriers at risk of developing chronic liver diseases (cirrhosis, carcinoma, and liver failure). As such, HCV is responsible for two thirds of all liver transplants in the developed world. Recent studies show that the death rate from HCV infection is rising due to the increasing age of chronically infected patients. [0007] DNV is the most prevalent flavivirus in humans, is endemic in most tropical and subtropical countries, and is currently emerging elsewhere including the U.S. and across the Pacific Islands. DNV circulates as 4 serotypes (DNV1 - 4) and following a first infection, re-infection can lead to fatal hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Infection is believed to provide life-long immunity against reinfection by the same serotype, but not against other serotypes. Epidemic outbreaks have been reported in many countries throughout Latin America, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific Regions. It is estimated that between 50 and 100 million cases of Dengue fever occur globally each year. Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome represent severe forms of the disease. Currently there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat DNV infection and no approved vaccine. [0008] WNV is a related flavivirus that is endemic in regions of Africa and Asia, but is now emerging in the Western hemisphere. WNV is neuroinvasive to cause serious encephalitis disease and is lethal in about 6% of cases. Neuroinvasive WNV can present as meningitis, encephalitis or less frequently a flaccid paralysis referred to as poliomyelitis. WNV was largely absent from North America prior to 1999, but reemerged on the continent following an isolated outbreak of encephalitis in New York. In the subsequent 7 years, WNV infection spread throughout the 48 contiguous United States, and current estimates suggest as many as 2 - 3 million Americans have been infected. Over the past 20 years, outbreaks have been reported in parts of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and North America. Currently there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat WNV infection and no approved vaccine. [0009] Among the RNA viruses listed, very few vaccines are currently approved for clinical use. One such vaccine exists for influenza virus, which must be revised and administered annually. Accordingly, drug therapy is essential to mitigate the significant morbidity and mortality associated with these viruses. Unfortunately, the number of antiviral drugs is limited, many are poorly effective, and nearly all are plagued by the rapid evolution of viral resistance and a limited spectrum of action. Ribavirin, a guanine nucleoside analog, has been studied in clinical trials of diverse RNA virus infections and is likely the most broadly acting antiviral agent available. Ribavirin is approved to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, and Lassa virus related mortality was shown to be reduced with intravenous ribavirin treatment. However, it is weakly effective as a single agent and has significant hematologic toxicity. Both classes of acute influenza antivirals, adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors, are only effective within the first 48 hours after infection, thereby limiting the window of opportunity for treatment. High resistance to adamantanes already restricts their use, and massive stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors will eventually lead to overuse and the emergence of resistant strains of influenza. [0010] Based on the foregoing, there is an immense and unmet need for effective treatments against viral infections. Most drug development efforts against viruses target viral proteins. RNA viruses have small genomes, with many encoding less than a dozen proteins, resulting in a very limited number of viral targets for new drugs. This is a large part of the reason that current drugs are narrow in spectrum and subject to the emergence of viral resistance. However, there is benefit to discovery of new viral targets for inhibition. Alternatively, direct-acting antiviral therapy can work to counteract any infection mechanisms such as viral entry into a host cell. [0011] New antiviral therapy can act directly against viruses. In particular, new antiviral therapy can exploit the fact that these viruses are susceptible to control by innate intracellular immune defenses that function to suppress virus replication and spread. Compounds that act on cellular targets are likely to be more effective, be less susceptible to the emergence of viral resistance, cause fewer side effects, and be effective against a range of different viruses. An effective broad-spectrum antiviral, whether used on its own or in combination with other therapies, would be an enormous benefit to current clinical practice. While interferon is in principal host-mediated and broad spectrum, many viruses have evolved the ability to disrupt interferon signaling downstream of drug action at the receptor. An important criterion is the development of drugs that activate innate immune signaling below specific virus countermeasures and are a unique addition to conventional antiviral compounds in development or on the market. As one such innate immune antiviral response, the RIG-l-like receptor (RLR) pathway of innate antiviral immunity can impose a potent blockade to RNA virus infection through the actions of a variety of antiviral defense genes.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0032] The present disclosure provides compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods that shift the focus of viral treatments away from the targeting of viral proteins to targeting and enhancing the host (subject's) innate antiviral response. Such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods are likely to be more effective, less susceptible to the emergence of viral resistance, cause fewer side effects, and be effective against a range of different viruses. [0033] The retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) pathway is intimately involved in regulating the innate immune response to virus infections including RNA virus infections. RIG-I is a cytosolic pathogen recognition receptor that is essential for triggering immunity to a wide range of RNA viruses. RIG-I is a double-stranded RNA helicase that binds to motifs within the RNA virus genome characterized by homopolymeric stretches of uridine or polymeric U/A motifs. Binding to RNA induces a conformation change that relieves RIG-I signaling repression by an autologous repressor domain, thus allowing RIG-I to signal downstream through its tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs). RIG-I signaling is dependent upon its NTPase activity, but does not require the helicase domain. RIG-I signaling is silent in resting cells, and the repressor domain serves as the on-off switch that governs signaling in response to virus infection. [0034] Without being bound by a theory or particular mechanism of action, RIG-I signaling is transduced through IPS-1 (also known as Card if, MAVs, and VISA), an essential adaptor protein that resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane. IPS-1 recruits a macromolecular signaling complex that stimulates the downstream activation of IRF-3, a transcription factor that induces the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and virus-responsive genes that control infection. Compounds that trigger RIG-I signaling directly or through modulation of RIG-I pathway components, including IRF-3, present attractive therapeutic applications as antivirals or immune modulators. [0035] In certain embodiments, a high-throughput screening approach was used to identify compounds that modulate the RIG-I pathway. In particular embodiments, validated RIG-I agonist lead compounds were demonstrated to specifically activate IRF- 3. In additional embodiments, the compounds have one or more of the following advantages: induce expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs low cytotoxicity in cel!-based assays, suitable for analog development and SAR studies, drug-like physiochemical properties, and/or antiviral activity against viruses including Dengue virus (DNV), human coronavirus (SARS and MERS-like pathogen), influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and/or Hepatitis C virus (HCV). In additional embodiments, the compounds exhibit antiviral activity against dsDNA viruses including human cytomegalovirus. In certain embodiments, the compounds exhibit all of these characteristics. [0036] The disclosed compounds represent a new class of antiviral therapeutics. Although the disclosure is not bound by a specific mechanism of action of the compounds in vivo, the compounds are selected for their modulation of innate immune antiviral responses. In certain embodiments, the modulation is activation of the RIG-I pathway.

[0135] Pharmaceutical compositions can be formed by combining a compound disclosed herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or salt thereof, with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for delivery to a subject in accordance with known methods of drug delivery. Accordingly, a "pharmaceutical composition" includes at least one compound disclosed herein together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or diluents, as appropriate for the chosen mode of administration. [0136] A pharmaceutical composition including a compound of the disclosure can be formulated in a variety of forms depending upon the particular indication being treated and will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Formulating pharmaceutical compositions including one or more compounds of the disclosure can employ straightforward medicinal chemistry processes. The pharmaceutical compositions can be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and/or can contain conventional adjuvants, such as buffering agents, preservatives, isotonicifiers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, etc. [0137] The administration of the formulations of the present disclosure can be performed in a variety of ways, including orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intracerebrally, intranasally, transdermal^, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary, intrathecal^, vaginally, recta I ly, intraocularly, or in any other acceptable manner. The formulations can be administered continuously by infusion, although bolus injection is acceptable, using techniques known in the art, such as pumps (e.g., subcutaneous osmotic pumps) or implantation, in some instances the formulations can be directly applied as a solution or spray. [0138] An example of a pharmaceutical composition is a solution designed for parenteral administration. Although in many cases pharmaceutical solution formulations are provided in liquid form, appropriate for immediate use, such parenteral formulations can also be provided in frozen or in lyophilized form. In the former case, the composition must be thawed prior to use. The latter form is often used to enhance the stability of the active compound contained in the composition under a wider variety of storage conditions, as it is recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that lyophilized preparations are generally more stable than their liquid counterparts. Such lyophilized preparations are reconstituted prior to use by the addition of one or more suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluents such as sterile water for injection or sterile physiological saline solution. [0139] Parenterals can be prepared for storage as lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions by mixing, as appropriate, the compound having the desired degree of purity with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers typically employed in the art (all of which are termed "excipients"), for example buffering agents, stabilizing agents, preservatives, isotonifiers, non-ionic detergents, antioxidants and/or other miscellaneous additives. [0140] Buffering agents help to maintain the pH in the range which approximates physiological conditions. They are typically present at a concentration ranging from 2 mM to 50 mM of a pharmaceutical composition. Suitable buffering agents for use with the present disclosure include both organic and inorganic acids and salts thereof, such as citrate buffers (e.g., monosodium citrate-disodium citrate mixture, citric acid-trisodium citrate mixture, citric acid-monosodium citrate mixture, etc.), succinate buffers (e.g., succinic acid-monosodium succinate mixture, succinic acid-sodium hydroxide mixture, succinic acid-disodium succinate mixture, etc.), tartrate buffers (e.g., tartaric acid- sodium tartrate mixture, tartaric acid-potassium tartrate mixture, tartaric acid-sodium hydroxide mixture, etc.), fu ma rate buffers (e.g., fumaric acid-monosodium fumarate mixture, fumaric acid-disodium fumarate mixture, monosodium fumarate-disodium fumarate mixture, etc.), gluconate buffers (e.g., gluconic acid-sodium glyconate mixture, gluconic acid-sodium hydroxide mixture, gluconic acid-potassium glyconate mixture, etc.), oxalate buffer (e.g., oxalic acid-sodium oxalate mixture, oxalic acid-sodium hydroxide mixture, oxalic acid-potassium oxalate mixture, etc.), lactate buffers (e.g., lactic acid-sodium lactate mixture, lactic acid-sodium hydroxide mixture, lactic acid- potassium lactate mixture, etc.), and acetate buffers (e.g., acetic acid-sodium acetate mixture, acetic acid-sodium hydroxide mixture, etc.). Additional possibilities are phosphate buffers, histidine buffers, and trimethylamine salts such as Tris. [0141] Preservatives can be added to retard microbial growth, and are typically added in amounts of G.2%-1% (w/v). Suitable preservatives for use with the present disclosure include phenol, benzyl alcohol, meta-cresol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, octadecyldimethylbenzyi ammonium chloride, benzalkonium halides (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, bromide or iodide), hexamethonium chloride, a Iky I parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben, catechol, resorcinol, cyclohexanol and 3-pentanol. [0142] Isotonicifiers can be added to ensure isotonicity of liquid compositions and include polyhydric sugar alcohols, preferably trihydric or higher sugar alcohols, such as glycerin, erythritol, arabitol, xyiitol, sorbitol and mannitoi. Polyhydric alcohols can be present in an amount between 0.1 % and 25% by weight, typically 1 % to 5%, taking into account the relative amounts of the other ingredients. [0143] Stabilizers refer to a broad category of excipients which can range in function from a bulking agent to an additive which solubilizes the therapeutic agent or helps to prevent denaturation or adherence to the container wall. Typical stabilizers can be polyhydric sugar alcohols (enumerated above); amino acids such as arginine, lysine, glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, alanine, ornithine, L-leucine, 2-phenylalanine, glutamic acid, threonine, etc.; organic sugars or sugar alcohols, such as lactose, trehalose, stachyose, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, ribitol, myoinisitol, galactitol, glycerol and the like, including cyclitols such as inositol; polyethylene glycol; amino acid polymers; sulfur-containing reducing agents, such as urea, glutathione, thioctic acid, sodium thioglycolate, thioglycerol, alpha-monothioglycerol and sodium thiosulfate; Sow molecular weight polypeptides (i.e., <10 residues); proteins such as human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; monosaccharides such as xylose, mannose, fructose and glucose; disaccharides such as lactose, maltose and sucrose; trisaccharides such as raffinose, and polysaccharides such as dextran. Stabilizers are typically present in the range of from 0.1 to 10,000 parts by weight based on the active compound weight. [0144] Additional miscellaneous excipients include fillers (e.g., starch), chelating agents (e.g., EDTA), antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, methionine, vitamin E), and cosolvents. [0145] Particular embodiments can include one or more of ethanol (<10%), propylene glycol (<40%), polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 or 400 (<60%), N-N-dimethylacetamide (DMA, <30%), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, <20%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, <20%) co-solvents or the cyclodextrins (<40%) and have a pH of 3 to 9. [0146] The compound(s) can also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coascervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example hydroxymethylcellulose, gelatin or poly-(methylmethacrylate) microcapsules, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, A Wolters Kluwer Company, 2005. [0147] Parenteral formulations to be used for in vivo administration generally are sterile. This is readily accomplished, for example, by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. [0148] Generally, the pharmaceutical compositions can be made up in a solid form (including granules, powders, or suppositories) or in a liquid form (e.g., solutions, suspensions, or emulsions). The compounds can be admixed with adjuvants such as lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, stearic acid, talc, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulphuric acids, acacia, gelatin, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidine, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and tableted or encapsulated for conventional administration. Alternatively, they can be dissolved in saline, water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, oils (such as corn oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, or sesame oil), tragacanth gum, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well known in the pharmaceutical art. The carrier or diluent can include time delay material, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in the art. [0149] Oral administration of the compounds and compositions is one intended practice of the disclosure. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition can be in solid or liquid form, e.g., in the form of a capsule, tablet, powder, granule, suspension, emulsion or solution. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a given amount of the active ingredient. A suitable daily dose for a human or other subject can vary widely depending on the condition of the subject and other factors, but can be determined by persons of ordinary skill in the art using routine methods. [0150] Solid dosage forms for oral administration can include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound can be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also include, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms can also include buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. For buccal administration the pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manners. [0151] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such pharmaceutical compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. [0152] The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g. by bolus injection, or infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. in glass ampoule or multi-dose containers, e.g. glass vials. The pharmaceutical compositions for injection can take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulatory agents such as antioxidants, buffers, non-ionic detergents, dispersants, isotonicifiers, suspending agents, stabilizers, preservatives, dispersing agents and/or other miscellaneous additives. [0153] Although in many cases pharmaceutical compositions provided in liquid form are appropriate for immediate use, such parenteral formulations can also be provided in frozen or in lyophilized form. In the former case, the pharmaceutical composition must be thawed prior to use. The latter form is often used to enhance the stability of the compound contained in the pharmaceutical composition under a wider variety of storage conditions, as it is recognized by those or ordinary skill in the art that lyophilized preparations are generally more stable than their liquid counterparts. Parenterals can be prepared for storage as lyophilized formulations by mixing, as appropriate, the compound having the desired degree of purity with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers typically employed in the art (all of which are termed "excipients"), for example, antioxidants, buffers, non-ionic detergents, dispersants, isotonicifiers, suspending agents, stabilizers, preservatives, dispersing agents and/or other miscellaneous additives. Such lyophilized preparations are reconstituted prior to use by the addition of one or more suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluents such as sterile pyrogen-free water for injection or sterile physiological saline solution. [0154] For administration by inhalation (e.g., nasal or pulmonary), the pharmaceutical compositions can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray, from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, and/or with the use of suitable propellant, e.g. dich!orodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gases or mixture of gases. [0155] The compounds or compositions can be admixed with adjuvants such as lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, stearic acid, talc, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulphuric acids, acacia, gelatin, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidine, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and tableted or encapsulated for conventional administration. Alternatively, they can be dissolved in saline, water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, oils (such as corn oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil or sesame oil), tragacanth gum, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are known in the pharmaceutical art. The carrier or diluent can include time delay material, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials known in the art. [0156] In addition to the formulations described above, the pharmaceutical compositions can also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation or by intramuscular injection. [0157] The compounds can also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coascervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, (for example hydroxymethylcellulose, gelatin or poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules), in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, A Wo!ters Kluwer Company, 2005. [0158] Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the compound or composition, the matrices having a suitable form such as a film or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2- hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) or poly(vinylalcohol)), poly!actides, copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glyco!ic acid copolymers such as the PROLEASE® technology (Alkermes, Cambridge, Massachusetts) or LUPRON DEPOT® (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene- vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for long periods such as up to or over 100 days, certain hydrogels release compounds for shorter time periods. [0159] Methods of Use [0160] The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein can be used to treat a viral infection in a subject; wherein the viral infection is caused by a virus from one the following families: Arenaviridae, Arterivirus, Astroviridae, Birnaviridae, Bromoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Caliciviridae, Closteroviridae, Comoviridae, Coronaviridae, Cystoviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Flexiviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Hepevirus, Herpesviridae, Leviviridae, Luteoviridae, Mesoniviridae, Mononegavirales, Mosaic Viruses, Nidovirales, Nodaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picobirnavirus, Picornaviridae, Potyviridae, Reoviridae, Retroviridae, Roniviridae, Sequiviridae, Tenuivirus, Togavi dae, Tombusviridae, Totiviridae, and Tymoviridae. [0161] According to more specific embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions can be used to treat a viral infection caused by one or more of Alfuy virus, Banzi virus, bovine diarrhea virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus (DNV), Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), HIV, llheus virus, influenza virus (including avian and swine isolates), rhinovirus, norovirus, adenovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Kokobera virus, Kunjin virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, louping-ill virus, measles virus, MERS-coronavirus (MERS), metapneumovirus, any of the Mosaic Viruses, Murray Valley virus, parainfluenza virus, poliovirus, Powassan virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Rocio virus, SARS- coronavirus (SARS), St. Louis encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, WNV, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa virus, Tacaribe virus, Junin virus, and yellow fever virus. [0162] In an embodiment, a method of treating a viral infection in a subject can include administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical com osition having the structure In some cases, the viral infection is caused by Ebola virus. [0163] Many RNA viruses share biochemical, regulatory, and signaling pathways. These viruses include influenza viruses (including avian and swine isolates), rhinovirus, norovirus, DNV, RSV, WNV, HCV, parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, Chikungunya virus, SARS, MERS, poliovirus, measles virus, yellow fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Murray Valley virus, Powassan virus, Rocio virus, louping-ill virus, Banzi virus, llheus virus, Kokobera virus, Kunjin virus, Alfuy virus, bovine diarrhea virus, any of the Mosaic Viruses, HIV, Ebola virus, Lassa virus, and the Kyasanur forest disease virus. The compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods disclosed herein can be used to treat these viruses. [0164] Antiviral activity against WNV, Nipah Virus, Lassa Fever Virus, and Ebola Virus in vitro is measured by focus-forming assay. Virus strains that are used in these assays include WNV-TX (WNV), WNV-MAD (WNV), NiV-Malaysia (Nipah), LASV-Josiah (Lassa Fever), and ZEBOV-Mayinga (Ebola). Cultured human cells including human umbilical vein cells (HUVEC) are seeded in tissue-culture plates and infected with virus at MOI of 0.01 to 0.5 for a duration including but not limited to 2 hours and then removed. Compound dilutions are prepared in 0.5% DMSO and used to treat cells at final concentrations of compound ranging 0.001 to 10 μΜ per well. Vehicle control wells contain 0.5% DMSO and are used to compare to drug treated cells. Virus infections after drug treatment are allowed to proceed for 48 to 96 hours. Virus supernatants are then harvested and used to infect new monolayer of permissive ceils. The newly infected cells are incubated overnight (18-24 hours) and used to measure the level of infectious virus in the original supernatants by focus-forming assay using methods generally known in the art. [0165] Methods disclosed herein include treating subjects (humans, mammals, free- range herds, veterinary animals (dogs, cats, reptiles, birds, etc.), farm animals and livestock (horses, cattle, goats, pigs, chickens, etc.), and research animals (monkeys, rats, mice, fish, etc.)) with pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein. Treating subjects includes delivering therapeutically effective amounts. Therapeutically effective amounts include those that provide effective amounts, prophylactic treatments, and/or therapeutic treatments. [0166] An "effective amount" is the amount of a compound necessary to result in a desired physiological change in the subject. Effective amounts are often administered for research purposes. Effective amounts disclosed herein reduce, control, or eliminate the presence or activity of viral infections and/or reduce, control, or eliminate unwanted side effects of viral infections. For example, an effective amount may result in a reduction in viral protein in a subject or assay, a reduction in viral RNA in a subject or assay, and/or a reduction in virus present in a cell culture. [0167] A "prophylactic treatment" includes a treatment administered to a subject who does not display signs or symptoms of a viral infection or displays only early signs or symptoms of the viral infection such that treatment is administered for the purpose of diminishing, preventing, or decreasing the risk of developing the viral infection further. Thus, a prophylactic treatment functions as a preventative treatment against a viral infection. Prophylactic treatment may also include vaccines as described elsewhere herein. Prophylactic treatment may result in a lack of increase in viral proteins or RNA in a subject, and/or a lack of increase in clinical indicators of viral infection, such as: loss of appetite, fatigue, fever, muscle aches, nausea, and/or abdominal pain in the case of HCV; fever and/or headache in the case of WNV; and cough, congestion, fever, sore throat, and/or headache in the case of RSV. Prophylactic treatments can be administered to any subject regardless of whether signs of viral infection are present. In some embodiments, prophylactic treatments can be administered before travel. [0168] A "therapeutic treatment" includes a treatment administered to a subject who displays symptoms or signs of a viral infection and is administered to the subject for the purpose of diminishing or eliminating the signs or symptoms of the viral infection. The therapeutic treatment can reduce, control, or eliminate the presence or activity of viruses and/or reduce, control, or eliminate side effects of viruses. Therapeutic treatment may result in a decrease in viral proteins or RNA in a subject, and/or a decrease in clinical indicators of viral infection, such as: loss of appetite, fatigue, fever, muscle aches, nausea, and/or abdominal pain in the case of HCV; fever and/or headache in the case of WNV; and cough, congestion, fever, cyanosis, sore throat, and/or headache in the case of RSV. [0169] For administration, therapeutically effective amounts (also referred to herein as doses) can be initially estimated based on results from in vitro assays and/or animal model studies. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes an IC50 as determined in cell culture against a particular target. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in subjects of interest. [0170] The actual dose amount administered to a particular subject can be determined by a physician, veterinarian, or researcher taking into account parameters such as physical and physiological factors including target, body weight, severity of condition, type of viral infection, previous or concurrent therapeutic interventions, idiopathy of the subject, and route of administration. [0171] Pharmaceutical compositions can be administered intravenously to a subject for treatment of viral infections in a clinically safe and effective manner, including one or more separate administrations of the composition. For example, 0.05 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg can be administered to a subject per day in one or more doses (e.g., doses of 0.05 mg/kg once-daily (QD), 0.10 mg/kg QD, 0.50 mg/kg QD, 1.0 mg/kg QD, 1.5 mg/kg QD, 2.0 mg/kg QD, 2.5 mg/kg QD, 3.0 mg/kg QD, 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily (BID), 1.5 mg/kg BID or 2.0 mg/kg BID). For certain antiviral indications, the total daily dose of a compound can be 0.05 mg/kg to 3.0 mg/kg administered intravenously to a subject one to three times a day, including administration of total daily doses of 0.05-3.0, 0.1-3.0, 0.5-3.0, 1 .0-3.0, 1.5-3.0, 2.0-3.0, 2.5-3.0, and 0.5-3.0 mg/kg/day of compounds of Table 1 using 60-minute QD, BID, or three times daily (TID) intravenous infusion dosing. In one particular example, antiviral pharmaceutical compositions can be intravenously administered QD or BID to a subject with, e.g., total daily doses of 1.5 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg of a composition with up to 92-98% wt/wt of a compound of Table 1.

The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered continuously by infusion, although bolus injection is acceptable, using techniques well known in the art, such as pumps (e.g., subcutaneous osmotic pumps) or implantation. In some instances the pharmaceutical compositions can be directly applied as a solution or spray. [0175] Particular embodiments provide for pharmaceutical compositions including any one or more of the compounds described herein, for the purpose of treating and/or preventing disease in a subject. Additional embodiments provide for pharmaceutical compositions alone or in combination with an antigen. As such, in some embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions can be used as vaccines. [0176] The disclosure provides for the use of the compounds as adjuvants. [0177] The compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods disclosed herein can be additive or synergistic with other therapies currently in development or use. For example, ribavirin and interferon-a provide an effective treatment for HCV infection when used in combination. Their efficacy in combination can exceed the efficacy of either drug product when used alone. The pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure can be administered alone or in combination or conjunction with interferon, ribavirin, and/or a variety of small molecules that are being developed against both viral targets (viral proteases, viral polymerase, and/or assembly of viral replication complexes) and host targets (host proteases required for viral processing, host kinases required for phosphorylation of viral targets such as NS5A, and inhibitors of host factors required to efficiently utilize the viral internal ribosome entry site, or IRES).

[0183] These agents can be incorporated as part of the same pharmaceutical composition or can be administered separately from the compounds of the disclosure, either concurrently or in accordance with another treatment schedule. [0184] The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions can be additive or synergistic with other compounds or pharmaceutical compositions to enable vaccine development. By virtue of their antiviral and immune enhancing properties, the compounds can be used to affect a prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination. The compounds need not be administered simultaneously or in combination with other vaccine components to be effective. The vaccine applications of the compounds are not limited to the treatment of viral infection but can encompass all therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine applications due to the general nature of the immune response elicited by the compounds. [0185] A "vaccine" is an immunogenic preparation that is used to induce an immune response in an individual. A vaccine can have more than one constituent that is immunogenic. A vaccine can be used for prophylactic and/or therapeutic purposes. A vaccine does not necessarily have to prevent viral infections. Without being bound by theory, the vaccines of the disclosure can affect an individual's immune response in a manner such that viral infection occurs in a lesser amount (including not at all) or such that biological or physiological effects of the viral infection are ameliorated when the vaccine is administered as described herein. As used herein, vaccines include preparations including pharmaceutical compositions including the compounds, alone or in combination with an antigen, for the purpose of treating a viral infection in a subject including a vertebrate animal. [0186] The disclosure provides for the use of the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions as adjuvants. An adjuvant enhances, potentiates, and/or accelerates the beneficial effects of another administered therapeutic agent. In particular embodiments, the term "adjuvant" refers to compounds that modify the effect of other agents on the immune system. Adjuvants that possess this function may also be inorganic or organic chemicals, macromolecules, or entire cells of certain killed bacteria, which enhance the immune response to an antigen. They may be included in a vaccine to enhance the recipient's immune response to the supplied antigen. [0187] As is understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, vaccines can be against viruses, bacterial infections, cancers, etc. and can include one or more of a live attenuated vaccine (LAIV), an inactivated vaccine (IIV; killed virus vaccine), a subunit (split vaccine); a sub-virion vaccine; a purified protein vaccine; or a DNA vaccine. Appropriate adjuvants include one or more of water/oil emulsions, non-ionic copolymer adjuvants, e.g., CRL 1005 (Optivax; Vaxcel Inc., Norcross, Ga.), aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, aqueous suspensions of aluminum and magnesium hydroxides, bacterial endotoxins, polynucleotides, polyelectrolytes, lipophilic adjuvants and synthetic muramyl dipeptide (norMDP) analogs such as N-acetyl-nor-muranyl-L-alanyl-D- isoglutamine, N-acetyl-muranyl-(6-0-stearoyl)-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, or N-Glycol- muranyl-LalphaAbu-D-isoglutamine (Ciba-Geigy Ltd.). [0188] The present disclosure further includes the use and application of the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions in vitro in a number of applications including developing therapies and vaccines against viral infections, research in modulation of the innate immune response in eukaryotic cells, etc. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions disclosure can also be used in animal models. The results of such in vitro and animal in vivo uses of the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can, for example, inform their in vivo use in humans, or they can be valuable independent of any human therapeutic or prophylactic use. [0189] The Examples below are included to demonstrate particular embodiments of the disclosure. Those of ordinary skill in the art should recognize in light of the present disclosure that many changes can be made to the specific embodiments disclosed herein and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. For example, the Examples below provide in vitro methods for testing the compounds of the disclosure. Other in vitro and/or in vivo virus infection models include flaviviruses such as DNV, bovine diarrheal virus, WNV, and GBV-C virus, other RNA viruses such as RSV, SARS, and the HCV replicon systems. Furthermore, any appropriate cultured cell competent for viral replication can be utilized in the antiviral assays. [0190] EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLES [0191] Example 1. General Synthesis methods. [0192] The compounds of the disclosure may be prepared by the methods described below, together with synthetic methods familiar to those of ordinary skill in the art. The starting materials used herein are commercially available or may be prepared by routine methods known in the art (such as those methods disclosed in standard reference books such as the COMPENDIUM OF ORGANIC SYNTHETIC METHODS, Vol. I-VI (published by Wiley-lnterscience)). Preferred methods include those described below. [0193] During any of the following synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This can be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & Sons, 1981 ; T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & Sons, 1991 , and T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & Sons, 1999. [0194] Compounds of the disclosure, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, can be prepared according to the reaction Schemes described below. These methods can be modified or adapted in ways known to chemists of ordinary skill in order to achieve synthesis of additional compounds within the scope of the present invention. Such modification was done to synthesize an exemplary compound of the invention as described in Examples 2 and 3. Unless otherwise indicated, the substituents in the Schemes are defined as above. Isolation and purification of the products is accomplished by standard procedures, which are known to a chemist of ordinary skill. [0195] It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the various symbols, superscripts and subscripts used in the schemes, methods and examples are used for convenience of representation and/or to reflect the order in which they are introduced in the schemes, and are not intended to necessarily correspond to the symbols, superscripts or subscripts in the appended claims. The schemes are representative of methods useful in synthesizing the compounds of the present invention. They are not to constrain the scope of the disclosure in any way. [0196] Synthesis of N-(4-h l-5-yl)acetamide: 0.6 g of commercially available 5-azido-2-methyl-1 ,3-benzothiazole and 5 g of acetic acid were heated to 100 °C for 20 minutes. Evaporation and column chromatography purification of the residue afforded 0.43 g of N-(4-hyd roxy-2-methyl- , 3-benzothiazol-5- yl)acetamide. [0197] Synthesis of 5-amino-2-methyl-1 ,3-benzothiazol-4-ol: 0.4 g of the acetamide was treated with 2 mL concentrated HCI.

The reaction was stirred for 5 h at 80 °C then cooled to room temperature. 4 mL of water was added and the precipitate was filtered off, washed with water and dried to afford 0.154 g of N-(7- methylf^S^hiazoloiS^-gji .Sjbenzoxazoi^-ySJthiophene^-carboxamide, [0201] Example 3. Synthesis of N - [6 - (pyrrolidine - 1 - sulfonyl) - 1 ,3 - benzothiazol - 2 - yl]naphthalene - 2 - carboxa mide [0202] The intermediate 6-(pyrrolidin-1 -ylsulfonyl)-1 ,3-benzothiazol-2-amine, which was used in the synthesis of N - [6 - (pyrrolidine - 1 - sulfonyl) - 1 ,3 - benzothiazol - 2 - yl]naphthalene - 2 - carboxa mide, was s nthesized as described below: A mixture of commercially available 4-(pyrrolidin-1 -ylsulfonyl)aniline (1 .0 g) and ammonium thiocyanate (1 .01 g) was suspended in 25 mL acetic acid and heated to 90 °C. The mixture was cooled to 15 °C and liquid bromine (0.22 mL) was added dropwise. The reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum and the residue was added to a solution of aqueous sodium bicarbonate and stirred for 1 hour.

First, a small analog derivative set is used to define a structural class. The active analogs that are identified in this first stage are then used to define a subset of structural classes of interest for further optimization (Stage 2). [0205] Stage 2 focuses on creating structural diversity and evaluating core variants for derivative expansion. Structural derivatives are tested for biological activity including the IRF-3 translocation assay, antiviral activity, and cytotoxicity in one or more cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Optimized molecules that show improved efficacy and low cytotoxicity are further characterized by additional measures of in vitro toxicology and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME). Their mechanism of action and breadth of antiviral activity are also studied. [0206] To design analog structures, the drug-like properties, metabolic lability, and toxic potential of the lead compounds are analyzed. Drug-like properties, as measured by Lipinski's Rules, and related physiochemical properties are primary indicators of bioavailability. Structural features that suggest metabolic and toxicological liabilities may indicate limited stability, reduced half-life, reactive intermediates, or idiosyncratic toxicity and will therefore be removed. [0207] Compounds are tested for potent in vitro antiviral activity against viruses including HCV 2A, RSV, DNV type 2, and influenza A virus strains. Viral protein and RNA levels are assessed following drug treatment using the assays described herein. Analog design is aimed to identify lead compounds with picomolar to nanomolar potency, which is adequate to support preclinical development Lead compounds are characterized for their in vitro toxicological and ADME properties and for further mechanistic study. [0208] In vitro pharmacology studies are performed to measure performance of the most promising analogs in one or more assays of intestinal permeability, metabolic stability and toxicity. Key in vitro characterization studies can include plasma protein binding; serum, plasma, and whole-blood stability in human and model organisms; intestinal permeability; intrinsic clearance; human Ether-a-go-go (hERG) channel inhibition; and genotoxicity. [0209] For each analog, an HPLC- and/or HPLC-mass spectrometry-based analytical method is used to evaluate drug and metabolite concentrations in various test systems. Although the specific analytical method is optimized for each molecule, reverse-phase chromatography can be used alone or in combination with quadrupole mass spectrometry to characterize the identity and purity of several of the lead molecules. Initially, drug stability over time in increasing concentrations of serum, plasma, and whole blood from mammalian species (such as mouse, cynomolgus macaque, and human) is evaluated by HPLC, and a half-life is determined. [0210] Prominent metabolites were characterized by mass spectrometry. Human plasma protein binding were evaluated by partition analysis using equilibrium dialysis. For intestinal permeability modeling, apical-to-basolateral flux is assessed in the human epithelial cell line TC7. Hepatic clearance is estimated for a subset of the most promising analogs by measuring the rate of disappearance of the parent compound during incubation in human liver microsomes. As above, specific metabolites can be isolated and characterized. [0211] In vitro toxicology studies are performed to evaluate the potential cardiac and genetic toxicity of lead analogs. Automated patch-clamp is used to assess the impact of each compound on hERG channel currents in a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line transgenically expressing the human Kv1 1.1 gene. Concentrations up to the lesser of 30 times the maximum serum concentration or the limit of solubility of each compound are evaluated in order to determine an IC50 for the molecule on the hERG channel. A subset of compounds is evaluated over a range of concentrations for their ability to induce mutation reversion in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 or to promote micronucleus formation in CHO cells in culture. [0212] Example 5. Biological activity. [0213] This Example describes methods used to identify compounds that activate innate immune responses, including activation of the RIG-I pathway. Other compounds as described herein likewise can be evaluated by the methods described in this example, and other cell types can also be used. [0214] Cultured Huh 7 cells that were stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene coupled with a RIG-I signaling pathway responsive promoter (!FNp, ISG56, or ISG54 promoter) were seeded and allowed to grow overnight. The compound 1 was then added and cells were grown in the presence of compound 1 for 18-20 hours. Steady- Glo luciferase substrate (Promega) was added and luminescence was read on a luminometer (Berthold). [0215] Figure 1A shows that compound 1 of Table 1 as described herein was validated by demonstrating dose-dependent induction of the luciferase reporter gene coupled to the promoters for ΙΡΝβ ("IFNp-LUC," left), ISG56 ("ISG56-LUC," center), and ISG54 ("ISG54-LUC," right). Additionally, compound 1 did not induce a nonspecific promoter (β-actin-LUC, Figure 1 B). [0216] An immunofluorescent cytochemistry assay was used to determine IRF-3 activation and translocation to the nucleus. Cultured human HeLa cells were treated with increasing amounts of compound or equivalent amounts of DMSO diluted in media for 20 hours. Positive control wells were infected with 100 HA/mL Sendai virus for an equivalent time period. IRF-3 was detected using polyclonal rabbit serum specific to IRF-3 and a secondary antibody conjugated to DYLIGHT® (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL) 488. [0217] An immunofluorescent cytochemistry assay was used to determine NFKB activation. The innate immune response is also dependent on activation of the NFKB transcription factor. Cultured human HeLa cells were treated with increasing amounts of compound or equivalent amounts of DMSO diluted in media for 20 hours. Positive control wells were infected with 100 HA/mL Sendai virus for an equivalent time period. NFKB was detected using monoclonal mouse antibody specific to the p65 subunit of NFKB and a secondary antibody conjugated to DyLight 488. [0218] Quantification of the IRF-3 and NFKB immunofluorescent assays described herein was done as follows: 96-well plates containing cultured human cells treated with compound and stained for either IRF-3 or NFKB were scanned and quantified using the ARRAYSCAN® instrument and software (Celiomics). Activation of transcription factor was evidenced by increased nuclear intensity normalized for cytoplasmic intensity, or nuclear-cytoplasmic difference. Compound 1 shows a dose dependent increase in nuclear-cytoplasmic difference for !RF-3 (Figure 1 C) and for NFKB (Figure 1 D). [0219] Assays for innate immune gene expression were performed in cell types including HeLa cells, PH5CH8 cells, and HUVEC primary cells. Gene expression can be similarly assayed in cell types that include: primary blood mononuclear cells, human macrophages, THP-1 cells, Huh 7 cells, A549 cells, MRC5 cells, rat splenocytes, rat thymocytes, mouse macrophages, mouse splenocytes, and mouse thymocytes. Expression of other genes of interest can be assayed as described herein. [0220] Cultured HeLa cells were treated with 20μ , 10μΜ, 5μΜ of compound or a DMSO control and incubated for up to 24 hours. Cultured PH5CH8 cells were treated with 10μΜ, 5μΜ, 1 μΜ, or a DMSO control and incubated for up to 24 hours. Primary HUVEC cells were thawed and seeded in 6-well plates at 2.4x104 cells per well and allowed to grow to 80% confluence, typically 5 days in culture with fresh media replaced every 48 hours. Compound was added at 10μΜ, 1 μΜ or a DMSO control and incubated for up to 24 hours. Gene expression was assayed as described below. [0221] Cells were harvested and RNA was isolated using the QIAshredder columns and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. Reverse transcription was performed and the cDNA template was used for quantitative real-time PGR. PGR reactions were performed using commercially available, validated TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies) according to manufacturer instructions. Gene expression levels were measured using a relative expression analysis (AACt). [0222] Figures 2A-2C show induction of gene expression by compounds 1 and 2 of Table 1. Figure 2A shows gene expression levels of IFIT2 (left) and OAS1 (right) in HeLa cells over time from 4-24 hours post treatment with 10μΜ compound 1 (grey; OAS1 only) or 10μΜ compound 2 (black; IFIT2 and OAS1 both shown). Figure 2B shows gene expression levels of IFIT2 in PH5CH8 cells (solid color bars) and HeLa cells (black checked bars) treated with 10μΜ compound 1 (CPD 1) or compound 2 (CPD 2). Figure 2C shows gene expression levels of IFIT2 (left), OAS1 (center), and MxA (right) in primary HUVEC cells that were treated with μΜ compound 1 (CPD 1 ) or 1 μΜ compound 2 (CPD 2). [0223] Figures 3A-3B show induction of gene expression by compound 3 and compound 7 of Tabie 1. Figure 3A shows IFIT2 gene expression was induced by 5μΜ compound 3 or compound 7. Figure 3B shows compound 3 induced innate immune gene expression in mouse macrophage cells. [0224] Example 6. Ex vivo immune stimulatory activity of compound 1 [0225] The activity of compound 1 of Table 1 in primary immune cells was assayed to determine whether compound 1 stimulates immune responses. Cultured human primary dendritic cells were treated with 0, 1 , or 10 μΜ of compound 1 for 24 hours. Supernatant from treated wells was isolated and tested for levels of cytokine protein. Cytokines were detected using specific antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads and a secondary antibody that reacts with Streptavidin/Phycoerythrin to produce a fluorescent signal. The bound beads were detected and quantified using the MAGPIX® (Luminex Corp.) instrument, although similar techniques as are known in the art may be used to measure fluorescent protein production, such as for example an ELISA. [0226] Figure 4 shows induction of the chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 , MIP-1a, and !Ρ-1β by dendritic cells treated with compound 1 of Table 1 (concentrations shown in μΜ). LPS is shown as a positive control inducer of chemokine expression. [0227] Other cells from which cytokine secretion can be measured include, for example human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, human macrophages, mouse macrophages, mouse splenocytes, rat thymocytes, and rat splenocytes. [0228] Example 7. In vitro antiviral activity. [0229] To further characterize the breadth of antiviral activity of optimized molecules, cell culture infection models are used to analyze different viruses, including different strains of influenza virus, HCV, DNV, RSV, and WNV, an emerging public health concern. The studies include treating cells with compound 2-24 hours prior to infection or treating cells up to 8 hours after infection. Virus production and cellular ISG expression are assessed over a time course to analyze antiviral effects of representative compounds from lead structural classes. Known antiviral treatments including IFN are used as a positive control. [0230] Virus production is measured by focus-forming or plaque assay. In parallel experiments, viral RNA and cellular ISG expression are measured by qPCR and immunoblot analyses. These experiments are designed to validate compound signaling actions during virus infection, and assess compound actions to direct innate immune antiviral programs against various strains of viruses and in the setting of virus countermeasures. Detailed dose-response analyses of each compound are conducted in each virus infection system to determine the effective dose that suppresses virus production by 50% (IC50) and 90% (IC90) as compared with control cells for both the pre-treatment and post-treatment infection models. [0231] Compounds of the current invention are tested using in vitro models against viruses including: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), HCV H77 (genotype 1a), HW JFH1 (genotype 2a), Influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1 N1 mouse-adapted virus), Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1 N1 mouse-adapted neurovirulent virus), Influenza A/TX/36/91 (H1 N1 circulating virus), Influenza A/Udorn/72 (H3N2), WNV TX02 (lineage 1), WNV MAD78 (lineage 2), RSV, human coronavirus OC43 (SARS-like pathogen), and DNV type 2. [0232] Antiviral activity of exemplary compounds of the disclosure is demonstrated in Examples 8-1 1 below. [0233] Example 8. In vitro activity against respiratory syncytial virus [0234] HeLa cells were seeded the previous day in 6-well plates at 4x105 cells per well. The next day, the media was replaced with RSV in media without FBS at an MOI of 0.1. Virus binding occurred at 37°C for 2 hours. After 2 hours the cells were washed with warm complete media and replaced with media containing drug at varying concentrations of 10μΜ, 5μΜ, 1 μΜ, or a DMSO control. Cells were placed in a 37°C incubator for 48 hours. [0235] For virus detection and titration, HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 8x103 cells per well 24hrs prior to collecting virus supernatant. After the 48 hour incubation period, the virus supernatant from the infected plate was harvested and used to infect these cells at a 1/10 final dilution. Ceils were placed in a 37°C incubator for 24 hours. [0236] 24 hours after infection, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with methanol/acetone solution. After fixing the cells were washed twice with PBS and replaced with blocking buffer (10% horse serum, 1g/mL BSA and 0.1 % Triton-100X in PBS) for 1 hour. The blocking buffer was replaced with binding buffer containing a 1/2000 dilution of primary antibody for 2 hours at room temperature. The primary antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody against RSV. The ceils were washed twice with PBS and replaced with binding buffer containing 1/3000 dilution of the Alexa Fluor- 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and a Hoechst nuclear stain for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS and PBS is added to all wells. The 96-well plate was sealed and fluorescence activity associated with virus infectivity was determined by immunofluorescent assay using the Array Scan instrument (Thermo- Fischer). [0237] Treatment with compounds can be done prior to infection. In variations of this method, the compounds are added at varying time points prior to infection with virus. Virus detection and titration is conducted as described. [0238] Figure 5 shows results of experiments performed using the protocol of Example 8, demonstrating the antiviral activity of select compounds that demonstrated antiviral activity against RSV. +++ = greater than 70% inhibition of infection, ++ = greater than 50% inhibition, + = greater than 30% inhibition, - = less than 30% inhibition. Example 9. In vitro activity against influenza virus. [0239] Influenza A/Udorn/72 infection of H292 cells. 2x 06 H292 cells in RPMI1640+10%FCS were treated with 2μΜ compound 2 in a final concentration of 0.5% DMSO for 6 hours. Compound-containing media was aspirated and replaced with 1X MEM containing A/Udorn/72 at an MOI of 0.1 and placed at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. Two hours post infection, virus-containing media was aspirated and replaced with 1X MEM containing 1 ug/ml_ TPCK-treated Trypsin, 2μΜ compound 2, 0.5% DMSO.

[0240] Influenza A/Udorn/72 infection of HEK293 cells. 5x105 HEK293 cells were infected with A/Udorn/72 at an MOI of 0.2 in 1X MEM. After 2 hours post-infection, virus-containing media was aspirated and replaced with 1X MEM containing 1 pg/mL TPCK-treated Trypsin, 10uM compound 2, 0.5% DMSO. Cells were returned to 37°C, CO2 incubator for 18 hours. After 20 hours post-infection, virus supernatants were collected and titred on MDCK cells. [0241] Titer in MDCK cells. 10μΙ_ of infected supernatant was added to 2x106 MDCK cells in the presence of 2 g/mL TPCK-trypsin and placed in a 37°C C02 incubator. After 8 hours, supernatant was removed and cells were fixed and stained with FITC- conjugated antibody specific for Influenza NP protein.

[0242] The protocol of Example 9 can be performed as described in order to evaluate the antiviral activity of example compounds. Figure 6 shows antiviral activity of example compounds against Influenza A virus Udorn/72. Treatment of HEK293 cells with increasing concentrations of compound 3, compound 7, compound 9, and compound 10 of Table 1 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of virus infection (shown as % untreated negative control).

[0244] Cultured human Huh 7 cells were seeded in 6-welS tissue-culture plates at a density of 4x105 cells per well and grown for 24 hours. Cells were infected with DNV type 2 strain at multiplicity of infection (MOi) of 0.1 for 2 hours and then removed. Compound dilutions were prepared in 0.5% DMSO and used to treat cells at final concentrations of compound ranging 0.001 to 10 μΜ per well. Vehicle control wells treated with 0.5% DMSO were used to compare to drug treated cells. Replication was allowed to proceed for 48 hours. Virus supernatants were harvested and used to infect new monolayer of permissive cells, such as Vero cells that were seeded in 96-well plates at 8x103 cells per well 24hrs prior to collecting virus supernatant. [0245] The newly infected cells were incubated for 24 hours and used to measure the level of infectious virus in the original supernatants by immunofluorescent staining of viral protein. The ceils were fixed with ice-cold 1 :1 methanol and acetone solution and stained for DNV fusion protein. Primary mouse monoclonal antibody against DNV fusion protein (Millipore) was used at 1 :2000 dilution. Secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 dye (Invitrogen) and Hoescht Dye (nuclear staining) are used at 1 :3000 to detect DNV protein and cell nuclei.

Compound dilutions were prepared in 0.5% DMSO and used to treat cells at final concentrations of compound ranging 0.001 to 10 μΜ per well. Vehicle control wells treated with 0.5% DMSO were used to compare to drug treated cells. Replication was allowed to proceed for 5 days. Virus supernatants were harvested and used to infect new monolayer of permissive cells, such as Huh 7 cells that were seeded in 96-well plates 24 hours prior to collecting virus supernatant, i.e., 4 days post infection. [0251] The newly infected cells were incubated for 48 hours and used to measure the level of infectious virus in the original supernatants by immunofluorescent staining of viral protein. The cells are fixed with ice-cold 1 :1 methanol and acetone solution and stained for HCoV-OC43 nucleoprotein. Primary mouse monoclonal antibody against HCoV-OC43 nucleoprotein (Millipore) is used at 1 :1000 dilution. Secondary goat anti- mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 dye (Invitrogen) and Hoescht Dye (nuclear staining) were used at 1 :3000 to detect OC43 protein and cell nuclei.

In vivo pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of compounds. [0255] The in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and tolerability/toxicity of the compounds described herein are evaluated in order to conduct further characterization of their antiviral activity in vivo. [0256] A reverse-phase, HPLC-MS/MS detection method is used for measuring the concentration of each compound in mouse plasma. Prior to PK profiling, an initial oral and intravenous formulation for each compound is developed using a limited formulation component screen that is largely focused on maximizing aqueous solubility and stability over a small number of storage conditions. Any of the analytical methods as are known in the art can be used to measure formulation performance. A formulation is developed for each compound following a three tiered strategy: ■ Tier 1 : pH (pH 3 to 9), buffer, and osmolality adjustment ■ Tier 2: addition of ethanol (<10%), propylene glycol (<40%), or polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 or 400 (<60%) co-solvents to enhance solubility ■ Tier 3: addition of /V-A/-dimethylacetamide (DMA, <30%), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, <20%), and/or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, <20%) co-solvents or the cyclodextrins (<40%) as needed to further improve solubility. [0257] Example 13. In vivo antiviral activity of compounds. [0258] For compounds that demonstrate adequate performance in in vitro antiviral, mechanistic, ADME, and toxicology studies, a preliminary mouse PK study is performed. Each compound is administered as a single dose to animals by oral gavage (<10 ml/kg) or i.v. bolus injection (<5 ml/kg) after an overnight fast. Multiple animals are dosed for each dosing group such that 3 animals can be sampled at each time point. Blood samples are collected by retro-orbital sinus prior to dosing and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes, and 1 , 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-dosing. Drug concentrations are measured according to the previously developed bioanalytical method. PK parameters are evaluated using the WinNonlin software. [0259] Based upon performance in exploratory PK studies, compounds are further evaluated for preliminary tolerability and toxicity in mice prior to their characterization in antiviral models. Tolerability studies are performed in two stages: an initial dose escalation stage (up to 5 doses, each separated by a 5-day washout period) to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD, Phase 1 ), followed by seven daily administrations of the MTD to evaluate acute toxicity (Stage 2). All doses are administered by oral gavage. In an example experiment, five animals of each sex are placed on-study in stage 1 and 15 animals per sex per dosing group in Stage 2. Study endpoints include a determination of the MTD, physical examination, clinical observations, hematology, serum chemistry and animal bodyweights. Gross pathology is performed on all animals whether found dead, euthanized in extremis, or at the intended conclusion of the experiment. The toxicology studies are primarily exploratory in nature and intended to identify early toxicological endpoints, and drive selection of lead candidates for antiviral animal models. [0260] Example methods to complete the PK and tolerability studies described above are shown in Table 5. These methods may be modified and/or adapted such as a different route of administration, in order to more accurately measure the pharmacological properties of a compound. Ta ble 5 Route of Study Experimental design Outcomes administration Single dose Oral bioavailability, Mouse PK IV and Oral pharmacokinetic study Cmax, t¼, CI, Vd, AUCp-24,0-∞ Phase 1 : ascending dose tolerability MTD, acute toxicity, Mouse and MTD determination; hematology, serum Oral tolerability Phase 2: chemistry, gross placebo controlled 7-day pathology toxicity at MTD [0261] Figure 10 shows results from exploratory PK studies. Administration of compound 3 of Table 1 via oral (PO) or intravenous (IV) route resulted in detectable levels of compound in serum samples obtained up to 250 minutes post treatment (Figure 10A). At 4 hours post treatment of compound 3 and compound 7 of Table 1 , there was detectable compound in lung tissue (Figure 10B). [0262] Example compounds of the disclosure that demonstrate desirable PK properties, tolerability, antiviral potency, and/or innate immune activating activity, are selected for further evaluation in preclinical mouse models of infection. [0263] Incorporated in the design of these experiments is the determination of an effective dose for 50% and 90% suppression of serum viral load (EC50 and EC90) by each compound after a standard challenge of virus; for example, 100 pfu of WNV-TX or 1 ,000 pfu of influenza virus. Virus quantification in serum and/or target tissues are determined by established assay methods including: plaque assay, TCID50 assay, focus forming assay, viral protein quantification such as through HA assay or BCA assay, viral RNA quantification such as through qPCR, and/or antigen quantification such as through ELISA. [0264] The compound actions are tested in virus challenge studies at a minimum of 2 dose levels including the determined EC50 and EC90 to evaluate their ability to limit viral pathogenesis, virus replication, and virus spread. Mice are monitored for morbidity and mortality over a range of challenge doses (for example, 10 to 1 ,000 pfu of virus) either alone or in combination with compound treatment beginning 12 hours before or 24 hours after infection and continuing daily subject to the determined plasma half-life of the drug. Compound dose-response analysis and infection time course studies are also conducted to evaluate compound efficacy to: 1) limit serum viral load, 2) limit virus replication and spread in target organs, and 3) protect against viral pathogenesis. [0265] Studies to define effective dosage of drug in vivo and established mouse virus infection models are described in Table 6, although this list is not intended to be complete and the compounds can be tested in any mouse model for potency against any virus infection. Table 6 L treatment at 2 doses body temp., clinical viral pathogenesis, w/ placebo observations, virus replication, and bodyweight, cytokine spread levels, gene expression, markers of inflammation [0266] Mouse WNV model. Efficacy of compounds against WNV can be assayed after subcutaneous or intracranial (neuroinvasion) infection of virus. Compounds are administered daily by oral gavage or IP administration over the entire course of infection at 2 dose levels plus a placebo control group. Animals are evaluated for study endpoints including daily clinical observations, mortality, body weight, and body temperature. Virus titer is measured in serum, lymph nodes, spleen, and/or brain. Gene and cytokine expression at various time points during infection in compound-treated versus control animals can be assayed. [0267] Mouse influenza model. Virus infection is done by non-surgical intranasal or tracheal instillation of influenza virus strains A/WSN/33 and A/Udorn/72. These influenza virus strains are two different subtypes (H1 N1 and H3N2) and exhibit varying pathogenic properties and clinical presentations in C57BI/6 mice. Compounds are administered daily by oral gavage or IP administration over the entire course of infection (> 2 weeks) at 2 dose levels plus a placebo control group. Animals are evaluated for study endpoints including daily clinical observations, mortality, body weight, and body temperature. Virus titer is measured in serum, heart, lung, kidney, liver, and/or brain. Gene and cytokine expression at various time points during infection in compound- treated versus control animals can be assayed. [0268] Mouse RSV model. Virus infection is done by non-surgical intranasal or tracheal instillation of RSV A2 long strain at a dose that does not cause cytopathic effects. Compounds are administered daily by oral gavage or IP administration for > 3 weeks, at 2 dose levels or a placebo control. Animals are evaluated for study endpoints including daily clinical observations, mortality, body weight, and body temperature. Virus titer is measured in serum, blood, and/or lung. Gene and cytokine expression, and increased immune cell population counts can be assayed. [0269] Mouse DNV model. Virus infection is done by intraperitoneal injection of DNV type 2 strain. Compounds are administered daily by oral gavage or IP administration over the entire course of infection at 2 dose levels plus a placebo control group. Animals are evaluated for study endpoints including daily clinical observations, mortality, body weight, and body temperature. Virus titer is measured in serum, blood, heart, lung, kidney, liver, and/or brain. Gene and cytokine expression at various time points during infection in compound-treated versus control animals can be assayed. [0270] Mouse hepatitis virus type 1 (MHV-1 ) coronavirus model. Virus infection is done by non-surgical intranasal instillation of MHV-1 . Compounds are administered daily by oral gavage or IP administration over the entire course of infection (≥ 1 week) at 2 dose levels plus a placebo control group. Animals are evaluated for study endpoints including daily clinical observations, mortality, body weight, and body temperature. Virus titer is measured in serum, heart, lung, kidney, liver, and/or brain. Gene and cytokine expression at various time points during infection in compound-treated versus control animals can be assayed. [0271] Figure 1 1 shows a study performed using the mouse hepatitis virus type 1 (MHV-1 ) coronavirus model. Treatment with compound 3 of Table 1 resulted in decreased pathological symptoms including weight loss (A) and increased survival (B) after lethal challenge with MHV-1 . (C) Virus was decreased in the lung of animals treated with compound 3. [0272] The antiviral activity of example compounds are described in Table 7. Table 7 [0273] Example 14. In vivo adjuvant activity [0274] To characterize the breadth of adjuvant activity of compounds of the disclosure, animal models of vaccination and vaccination plus protection are used. The studies include priming animals including rats and mice with compound alone or in combination with an antigen and then assessing the adjuvant effect. [0275] Adjuvant effect is measured by assays for modified, enhanced immune humoral and cellular responses. Humoral responses are assessed over time at discrete times post vaccination and/or boosting by collecting blood for sera and determining relative concentrations of antibody classes (IgM, IgG, IgA or IgE) and/or isotypes including !gG1 , lgG2a, lgG2b, lgG2c, lgG3 for IgG antibodies. Moreover, affinity and avidity of the generated antibodies is also determined. In instances in which the vaccine preparation includes a combination of compound and antigen, the neutralizing activity of the generated antibodies is also determined. [0276] Cellular mediated immune responses induced by the compounds are measured by established methods in the field including ex vivo stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lymph nodes, splenocytes or other secondary lymphoid organs with the antigen and measurement of cytokine or chemokine production in the supernatant at several times thereafter. Cytokines measured include Th type of cytokines including IFN gamma and TNF alpha, Th2 type cytokines including IL-4, IL-10, IL-5 and IL-13 and Th17 cytokines including IL- 7, IL-21 and IL-23. Chemokines elicited by the compounds are also measured including RANTES, IP-10, MIP1 a, MIP1 b, and IL-8. T cell antigen specific production of cytokines can also be measured by intracellular cytokine staining with fluorescently labeled specific antibodies and flow cytometry or by ELISPOT. Both CD4+ ad CD8+ T cell populations are studied. [0277] Measurement of adjuvant activity at the cellular level is also determined by immunophenotyping of surface markers of activation by flow cytometry. CDS T cell antigen-specific responses are also evaluated by intracellular cytokine staining of perforin, cell surface marker expression or proliferation assays including thymidine incorporation. [0278] These experiments are designed to validate compound adjuvant activity in different combinations of prime-boost schemes and assess how compound-induced effects on innate immune antiviral programs shape the adaptive immune responses mounted to the antigen in the vaccine preparations. [0279] Detailed immune response analyses of each compound as described above are conducted with each selected antigen to determine the immune correlates for that particular antigen(s) and compound formulation. These results guide the protection studies in which animals vaccinated and boosted with combinations of select optimized compounds and desired antigen(s) formulations from select infectious agents are later challenged with doses of infectious agent that are known to result in disease or death of the animal. Protection afforded by vaccination is typically measured by monitoring of clinical symptoms and survival. [0280] Example 15. Anti-viral activity of compound 12 of Table 1 against Ebola virus. [0281] The in vitro efficacy of compound 12 of Table 1 was tested against Ebola virus (EBOV). As shown in Figure 12, compound 12 showed greater than a 2 log reduction in EBOC titer in vitro. Control titer (pfu/mL) was over 5, whereas the test titer using compound 12 was less than 3.5. [0282] Example 16. Anti-viral effect of compound 8 of Table 1.

When further clarity is required, the term "about" has the meaning reasonably ascribed to it by a person skilled in the art when used in conjunction with a stated numerical value or range, i.e. denoting somewhat more or somewhat less than the stated value or range, to within a range of ±20% of the stated value; ±19% of the stated value; ±18% of the stated value; ±17% of the stated value; ±16% of the stated value; ±15% of the stated value; ±14% of the stated value; ±13% of the stated value; ±12% of the stated value; ±1 1 % of the stated value; ±10% of the stated value; ±9% of the stated value; ±8% of the stated value; ±7% of the stated value; ±6% of the stated value; ±5% of the stated value; ±4% of the stated value; ±3% of the stated value; ±2% of the stated value; or ±1 % of the stated value. [0314] Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the disclosure are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. [0315] The terms "a," "an," "the" and similar referents used in the context of describing the disclosure (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context. Recitation of ranges of values herein is merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range. Unless otherwise indicated herein, each individual value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. All methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., "such as") provided herein is intended merely to better illuminate the disclosure and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the disclosure otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non-claimed element essential to the practice of the disclosure. [0316] Groupings of alternative elements or embodiments of the disclosure disclosed herein are not to be construed as limitations. Each group member can be referred to and claimed individually or in any combination with other members of the group or other elements found herein. It is anticipated that one or more members of a group can be included in, or deleted from, a group for reasons of convenience and/or patentability. When any such inclusion or deletion occurs, the specification is deemed to contain the group as modified thus fulfilling the written description of all Markush groups used in the appended claims. [0317] Certain embodiments of this disclosure are described herein, including the best mode known to the inventors for carrying out the disclosure. Of course, variations on these described embodiments will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the foregoing description. The inventor expects skilled artisans to employ such variations as appropriate, and the inventors intend for the disclosure to be practiced otherwise than specifically described herein. Accordingly, this disclosure includes all modifications and equivalents of the subject matter recited in the claims appended hereto as permitted by applicable law. Moreover, any combination of the above-described elements in all possible variations thereof is encompassed by the disclosure unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. [0318] Numerous references have been made to publications, patents and/or patent applications (collectively "references") throughout this specification. Each of the cited references is individually incorporated herein by reference for their particular cited teachings. [0319] In closing, it is to be understood that the embodiments of the disclosure disclosed herein are illustrative of the principles of the present disclosure. Other modifications that may be employed are within the scope of the disclosure. Thus, by way of example, but not of limitation, alternative configurations of the present disclosure may be utilized in accordance with the teachings herein.
