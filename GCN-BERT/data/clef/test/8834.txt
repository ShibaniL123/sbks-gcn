This invention relates to a method of modifying at least one carbohydrate in a tissue of a plant, to a vector for use therefor, and to a transformed plant cell, plant part or transgenic plant containing the vector. Sucrose, harvested primarily from sugarcane, is both a major human food as well as an important feedstock for fuel ethanol production. The commercial production of sugar may therefore benefit by either increasing the sugar content of the crop or increasing cane yield. Since increasing the sugar content of sugarcane results in increased sugar yields with a relatively small increase in associated production costs, gains in sugar content are viewed as economically more beneficial than corresponding increases in cane yield. This means that increased sugar content has become an important objective of sugarcane breeding programs and transgenic research using biotechnology-based approaches. Many biotechnology-based approaches for increasing the reduced carbon or nitrogen content of crops are directed towards increasing the concentrations of direct precursors of the target product (Sonnewald et al., 1997; Stark et al., 1992). These approaches tend to focus on increasing the concentration of the relevant metabolites, however have never resulted in significant increases of the target metabolite in a storage organ. Geigenberger P. et al (The Plant Cell, vol. 17, 2005, pages 2077-2088) discloses that UMP synthase inhibition results in an increase in the starch content of a potato tuber, a starch accumulating plant. Geigenberger et al further discloses a decrease in sucrose content in said plant in response to UMP synthase inhibition. US 2009/094717 (Troukhan et al, 2009) provides a general disclosure of plant transformation vectors, and the suggestion that many phenotypes of a plant could be modulated (increased and/or decreased) by using the nucleic acid molecules disclosed therein. A need therefore exists for an alternative method of modifying the carbohydrate content of crops such as sugar cane, and for crops such as sugarcane with a relatively higher sugar content. It is an object of this invention to provide a method of modifying the content of at least one carbohydrate of a plant. According to the invention, there is provided a method of increasing the content of at least one carbohydrate in one or more plant cells, the method including inhibiting UMP synthase (UMPS) activity in the one or more plant cells. Disclosed herein is a method of inhibiting UMPS activity, which includes the step of inserting into one or more plant cells at least one gene silencing cassette. Expressing the gene silencing cassette(s) thereby results in decreased UMP synthase activity and increased content of at least one carbohydrate (e.g. sucrose). Decreased UMPS activity may be brought about by various mechanisms (see e.g. discussion in the detailed description below regarding methods for reducing UMPS expression). The one or more gene silencing cassettes will be inserted into a population of cells (e.g. a callus). Further disclosed herein is a transgenic plant, which is regenerated from one or more plant cells produced as described above. Plant tissue and plant parts (for example, seeds, storage organs etc.) may be harvested from the plant. Plant tissue having an increased content of at least one carbohydrate is produced from one or more plant cells transformed as described above. This may optionally comprise regenerating a transgenic plant from one or more transformed plant cells. The term "tissue" is used herein in a broad sense and includes a reference to an aggregate of cells such as a callus. The cells of the tissue may be differentiated or undifferentiated. The cells may have a similar structure and/or function and may be specialized to perform a particular function. One or more plant cells may be transformed with one or more gene silencing cassette(s) which include nucleic acid operably linked to one or more transcription elements for transcribing the nucleic acid wherein transcription of the nucleic acid decreases activity of UMP synthase. Optionally the nucleic acid comprises (and optionally consists of) one or more of the following: (i) the antisense sequence of a UMPS ORF (e.g. the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO 1), or part thereof (e.g. at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 nucleotides of the sequence),(ii) a nucleotide sequence at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% similar, to the antisense sequence of a UMPS ORF (e.g. SEQ ID NO 1), or to part thereof,(iii) the sense sequence of a UMPS ORF (e.g. the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO 2), or part thereof,(iv) a nucleotide sequence at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% similar, to the sense sequence of a UMPS ORF (e.g. SEQ ID NO 2), or to part thereof,(v) (a) (i) or (ii) as above, and (b) (iii) or (iv) as above, optionally with a spliceable intron sequence between (a) and (b), and wherein the spliceable intron sequence is preferably at least 70 or 74 bp in length, preferably at least 100 bp, 200 bp, 300 bp, 400 bp, 450 bp, or 500 bp in length, and more preferably at least 74 bp in length. The UMPS ORF may correspond to the UMPS ORF of the transformed plant cell. Thus, for instance, where the plant cell is a sugarcane plant cell the UMPS ORF is the ORF of sugarcane and thus, for example, in accordance with (i) above, the nucleic acid comprises the antisense sequence of a sugarcane UMPS ORF, or part thereof. Two or more gene silencing cassettes may be inserted into one or more plant cells, e.g. a first gene silencing cassette with nucleic acid according to (i) or (ii) above, and a second gene silencing cassette with nucleic acid according to (iii) or (iv) above. Thus, sense and antisense molecules may be expressed from single or separate gene silencing cassettes. Such molecules may be used in double-stranded RNA interference whereby a sense and an antisense RNA molecule that is fully or partially complementary to the sense RNA molecule of a UMPS gene are expressed in the same plant cell, resulting in inhibition of the expression of the corresponding endogenous mRNA encoding UMPS. The one or more transcription elements may include a promoter, optionally a monocotyledonous promoter (e.g. a UBI promoter). The at least one carbohydrate may be selected from the group consisting of sucrose, starch, glucose, and fructose. The method results in an increased content of both starch and sucrose and optionally one or more further carbohydrates (e.g. glucose). The plant may be a sugar-storing plant, optionally selected from the group including sugarcane, sweet sorghum, and sugar beet. In particular, the plant is of the genus Saccharum, optionally sugarcane. Plant cells, plant tissue, plants and plant parts (e.g. seeds, storage organs, sugarcane) obtained or obtainable by the method described above are included within the scope of the invention. Further disclosed herein is a vector comprising one or more gene silencing cassettes for decreasing UMPS activity in a plant cell. In particular, the vector is a RNAi vector. The gene silencing cassette(s) may include nucleic acid operably linked to one or more transcription elements for transcribing the nucleic acid wherein transcription of the nucleic acid decreases activity of UMPS.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE DRAWINGS The preparation of a transgenic plant usually includes transforming a cell of a plant known as a protoplast. Transformation techniques for dicotyledons are well known in the art and include Agrobacterium-based techniques and techniques which do not require Agrobacterium. Transformation techniques include transformation via particle bombardment, protoplast uptake, such as with PEG and by electroporation, and microinjection. The choice of vector depends largely on the preferred selection for the species being transformed. A whole transgenic plant may then be generated from the transformed protoplast using standard techniques. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a technique used for transformation of dicotyledons because of its high efficiency of transformation and its broad utility with many different species which include tobacco, tomato, sunflower, cotton, oilseed rape, potato, soybean, alfalfa and poplar. Agrobacterium transformation typically involves the transfer of a binary vector, carrying the exogenous DNA, to an appropriate Agrobacterium strain. The strain selected depends on the complement of vir genes carried by the host Agrobacterium strain either on a co-resident plasmid or chromosomally. The transfer of the recombinant binary vector, to Agrobacterium is carried out by triparental mating using E. coli transformed with the recombinant binary vector. The recombinant binary vector can also be transferred to Agrobacterium by DNA transformation. Transformed tissue is regenerated on a selectable medium carrying an antibiotic or herbicide resistance marker. Direct gene transfer into protoplasts using PEG or electroporation techniques and particle bombardment into callus tissue are preferred transformation techniques for monocots. Transformation can be carried out with a single vector or with multiple vectors. Transformation of rice can also be undertaken by direct gene transfer techniques utilizing protoplasts or particle bombardment. Transformation of monocot cells such as Zea mays can be achieved by bringing the monocot cells into contact with a multiplicity of needle-like bodies on which these cells may be impaled, causing a rupture in the cell wall thereby allowing entry of transforming DNA into the cells. Methods for preparing nucleic acids encoding nucleotide sequences to effect gene silencing are known in the art. For instance, cDNA encoding the nucleic acid is inserted into a plant transformation vector in the form of a cassette containing all of the necessary elements for transformation of the plant cell and expression of the cDNA to produce the nucleic acid in the plant cell. The cassette may, for example, contain in proper reading frame and therefore operably linked, a promoter functional in plant cells, a 5' non-translated leader sequence, the insert DNA, and a 3' non-translated region functional in plants to cause the addition of polyadenylated nucleotides to the 3' end of the RNA sequence for translational requirements. Promoters for expression of nucleic acids in plant cells, and the nucleotide sequence thereof, may, for example, originate from plants or plant DNA viruses, and various promoters for this purpose are used in the art. Selected promoters may have constitutive activity such as the CaMV 35S promoter, the actin promoter, and the ubiquitin promoter. Alternatively, they may be inducible and thus drive the expression of the resistance gene at the sites of wounding or pathogen infection. Other useful promoters are expressed in specific cell types (such as leaf epidermal cells, meosphyll cells, root cortex cells) or in specific tissues or organs (roots, leaves or flowers, for example), such as the maize trpA gene that is preferentially expressed in pith cells and the promoter derived from the maize gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) which directs expression in a leaf-specific manner. The selected promoter may drive expression of the gene under a light induced or other temporally regulated promoter. A further alternative is that the selected promoter be chemically regulated. The promoter may also be specific for expression of the nucleic acid in monocotyledonous plants or for dicotyledonous plants. A variety of transcriptional cleavage and polyadenylation sites are available for use in expression cassettes. These are responsible for correct processing (formation) of the 3' end of mRNAs. Appropriate transcriptional cleavage and polyadenylation sites functional in plants include the CaMV 35S cleavage and polyadenylation sites, the tml cleavage and polyadenylations sites, the nopaline synthase cleavage and polyadenylation sites, the pea rbcS E9 cleavage and polyadenylation sites. These can be used in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. A number of non-translated leader sequences derived from viruses are known to enhance expression, specifically in dicotyledonous cells. Leader sequences from Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV, the "Ω-sequence"), Maize Chlorotic mottle Virus (MCMV), and Alfalfa Mosaic Virus (AMV) may be used to enhance expression. An expression cassette comprising nucleic acid containing one or more of the various elements described above may be inserted into a plant transformation vector by standard recombinant DNA methods. Alternatively, some or all of the elements of the expression cassette may be present in the vector, and any remaining elements may be added to the vector as necessary. Many transformation vectors are commercially available for plant transformation, and the nucleic acids of this invention can be used in conjunction with any such vectors. Most vectors include one or more genes encoding selection marker proteins. The vector used will depend upon the preferred transformation technique, the target species for transformation, and the selection marker desired. For certain target species, specific antibiotic or herbicide selection markers may be preferred, such as the nptII gene which confers resistance to kanamycin, the bar gene which confers resistance to the herbicide phosphinothricin, the hph gene which confers resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin, and the dhfr gene, which confers resistance to methotrexate. In accordance with the invention, transgenic plants may be prepared using standard techniques which result in downregulation or upregulation in expression of a gene or complete obliteration of its expression. In this way, plant cells, plants, plant parts etc. may be produced with reduced UMPS activity. The change in expression may be caused by the introduction of sequences which interfere with gene expression. Such sequences are known in the art and include antisense constructs, sense constructs, RNA silencing constructs, or RNA interference molecules; or it may be caused by genomic disruptions of the sensitivity gene itself through the use of, for example, transposons, tilling, homologous recombination, or nonsense mutations. The use of antisense nucleic acids is well known in the art, and can be RNA, DNA, a PNA or any other appropriate molecule. Catalytic RNA molecules or ribozymes can be used to inhibit expression of sensitivity genes. Ribozymes may be designed that specifically pair with target RNA and cleave the phosphodiester backbone at a specific location, thereby functionally inactivating the target RNA. Ribozyme sequences may be used in combination with antisense RNAs. Transgenic plants which include one or more inactivated sensitivity genes can also be produced by using RNA silencing or interference (RNAi), which can also be termed post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or cosuppression. In the context of this invention, "gene silencing" (also called RNA silencing, RNAi or RNA-mediated interference) includes a reference to any mechanism through which the presence of a single-stranded or double-stranded RNA in a cell results in the inhibition of expression of a target gene which comprises a sequence identical or nearly identical to that of the RNA, and includes, but is not limited to: RNA interference, repression of translation of a target mRNA transcribed from the target gene without alteration of the mRNA's stability, and transcriptional silencing such as by histone acetylation and heterochromatin formation leading to inhibition of transcription of the target mRNA. Any method to reduce the expression of a UMP synthase gene in a plant can be used in the practice of the invention. The term "expression" as used herein in the context of a gene product refers to the biosynthesis of that gene product, including the transcription and/or translation and/or assembly of the gene product. Methods for silencing (i.e. reducing or eliminating) the expression of a gene in a plant are well known in the art, and any such method may be used in the methods of the present invention. Antisense constructions, fully or partly complementary to at least a portion of the messenger RNA (mRNA) for the target sequence can be utilized as mentioned above. Antisense nucleotides are designed to bind to the corresponding mRNA. Modifications of the sequences for use in UMP gene silencing molecules of the invention may be made as long as the sequences bind to, and interfere with, expression of the corresponding mRNA. In this regard, sequences having at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 99%, or higher sequence similarity to the target UMP sequence may be used with the invention. Parts of the sequences for use in UMP gene silencing molecules of the invention may be also used to disrupt the expression of the target UMP gene. The use of sequences of at least about 10 nucleotides, at least about 20 nucleotides, at least about 30 nucleotides, at least about 40 nucleotides, at least about 50 nucleotides, at least about 100 nucleotides, at least about 200 nucleotides, at least about 300, at least about 400, at least about 450, at least about 500, at least about 550, or greater may preferably be used. Cosuppression may also be used to inhibit the expression of the target UMP gene. In this regard, a heterologous UMP synthase sequence may be expressed in the sense orientation to inhibit expression of the endogenous UMP synthase gene. Sequences similar to the UMP gene described herein may be found using various publically available databases known in the art such as GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html). The use of spliceable intron sequences in regulating the expression of exogenous genes in transgenic plants are known in the art. Spliceable intron sequences of at least 70 nt may be used with the invention. The use of sequences of at least about 70 nucleotides, at least about 100 nucleotides, at least about 200 nucleotides, at least about 300, at least about 400, at least about 450, at least about 500, at least about 550, or greater art known in the art. Spliceable intron sequences of up to about 0.75 kb or even up to 1.1 kb in length are known in the art. As disclosed herein, the sucrose, starch and glucose content of transgenic sugarcane tissue is increased by the RNAi-based down-regulation of UMPS. Briefly, a vector containing a gene silencing cassette is inserted into a plant cell, the gene silencing cassette including nucleic acid having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 and SEQ ID NO 2 and a spliceable 74 bp intron sequence there between, the gene silencing cassette operably linked to a transcription element in the form of the monocotyledonous promoter: the UBI promoter. Transcription of the nucleic acid in the plant cell decreases activity of UMP synthase. A transgenic sugarcane plant is then regenerated from the transformed plant cell; and sugarcane tissue with increased carbohydrate content is produced. EXAMPLE 1. Introduction Although uridine nucleotides have been reported by various groups to be important cofactors in the use of sugars for starch synthesis, recent work by Geigenberger et al. (2005) demonstrated that antisense inhibition of the de novo pathway of pyrimidine synthesis results in a compensatory stimulation of the lower energy-consuming salvage pathways. Downstream effects of the inhibition of this pathway in potato tubers included an elevated uridine nucleotide pool, elevated starch contents, decreased sucrose contents and an improved crop yield. De novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, also referred to as the orotate pathway, is defined as the formation of UMP from carbamoylphosphate (CP), aspartate, and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). Pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis consists of six enzymatic steps. Carbamoylphosphate synthase (CPSase) produces CP from a combination of carbonate, ATP, and an amino group. CP is used not only in pyrimidine de novo synthesis, but also as a precursor for arginine biosynthesis. The next step, in which aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) catalyzes the condensation of CP with aspartate to form carbamoylaspartate (CA), is specific for pyrimidine biosynthesis. Cyclization of the carbamoylaspartate to produce the pyrimidine ring is catalyzed by the enzyme dihydroorotase (DHOase). Subsequently, dihydroorotate (DHO) is oxidized by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) to yield orotate (OA). Orotate is condensed with PRPP to orotidine 5-monophosphate (OMP) by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase), which is then decarboxylated by orotidylate decarboxylase (ODCase) to form uridine-5-monophosphate (UMP). As de novo synthesis of nucleotides is energy consuming, cells have developed a strategy to reuse preformed nucleosides and nucleobases through salvage reactions. The nucleosides uridine/cytidine and thymidine are salvaged to their respective nucleotides by specific nucleoside kinases and uracil is directly salvaged with PRPP into UMP via uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. Salvage pathways may also play an important role in providing nucleobases to cells, which are unable to synthesize sufficient amounts for their needs. In plants, UMP synthase is a bifunctional protein catalyzing the final two steps of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. As in higher eukaryotes, plant UMP synthase has both orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRTase, EC 2.4.2.10) and orotidylate decarboxylase (ODCase, EC 4.1.1.23) activities. Inhibition of UMP synthase by antisense inhibition of the de novo pathway of pyrimidine synthesis has previously been shown to result in decreased sucrose contents (Geigenberger et al., 2005). In contrast, we report herein the unexpected increase in sugar content of a plant as a result of antisense inhibition of the de novo pathway of pyrimidine synthesis. 2. Materials and Methods All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (South Africa) unless otherwise indicated. All coupling enzymes were obtained from Roche (South Africa) unless otherwise indicated. 2.1 Preparation of transgenic sugarcane plants 2.1.1 Cloning of the UPMS silencing vector pihUMPS The ihpRNA vector used in this project was based on high-throughput RNAi gene silencing technology. The pihUMPS vector (Figure 1) was constructed from a 801 bp PCR product amplified from full length sugarcane UMPS cDNA cloned into pGEM®-T Easy (Promega). UMP synthase cDNA was isolated from sugarcane (variety N19) leaf roll RNA. Specific Forward (GCAAGTTTGCTGACATTGGA; SEQ ID NO 3) and Reverse (CCACAGAAGCACTGGTGAAA; SEQ ID NO 4) primers were designed from DNA sequence of sugarcane obtained from TIGR (TC68130, www.tigr.org) using Primer3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu). The isolated sequences show open reading frames (ORFs) of 166 amino acids. Because of the multi-cloning site availability as well as the T7 primer and the reverse T3; the pGEMT-Easy vector was used to clone the isolated gene prior to sub-cloning into pBlueScript® SK and pBlueScript® KS (using the PstI and ApaI sites) modified to contain a 45 bp intron sequence. The inserts and their adjacent intron segments from the modified pBlueScript® SK and pBlueScript® KS were subsequently isolated (following digestion of the plasmids with KpnI and XbaI). The expression vector pU3Z (which contains a monocotyledonous promoter) was likewise digested with KpnI and dephosphorylated. Using two-insert ligation, the pihUMPS construct was constructed which included the sense and antisense strands of UMP synthase. The UMPS gene fragments were separated by a fully assembled intron of 74 nucleotides in length. The pihUMPS vector therefore contained a UMPS fragment in antisense and sense orientation on either side of a spliceable intron sequence and operably linked to the UBI promoter. 2.1.2 Plant material Sugarcane plants (transgenic and wild type Saccharum spp. variety N19) were grown under greenhouse conditions (≈16 h light period, ≈25 °C). Three ripe stalks of each selected transgenic line were harvested. To limit metabolite losses, plant tissues (internodes 8-10 pooled) were cut into liquid N2 directly after harvest and ground to a fine powder in an IKA® A11 basic (IKA) analytical mill. All tissues were stored in 50 mL screw cap tubes (Corning) at -80 °C. 2.1.3 Plant transformation The pihUMPS vector was used to co-transform sugarcane calli using standard protocols. Transgenic calli were selected using Genetycin according to standard protocols, based on the npt-II selection marker in the co-transformed construct, and regenerated into plants. Regenerated plants were hardened off and grown under greenhouse conditions for further analysis. 2.1.4 PCR Screening of putative transformants To select positively transformed clones, transformants were screened by means of PCR amplification for the presence of the pihUMPS vector. DNA was extracted from 30-50 mg tissues from mature internodes (8-10) of putative transgenic lines as described by a method modified from McGarvey and Kaper (1991). 400 µL extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)(Merck), 0.7 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% polyvinylpirrolidone, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (BME, added just before use)) was added to the tissue and vortexed for 1 minute. Tubes were then incubated for 60 min at 60 °C. 400 µL chloroform was added and samples were vortexed and spin down (13 000 rpm, 5 min). The aqueous layer was transferred to new Eppendorff tubes containing 1 volume cold 100% isopropanol and incubated on ice for 15 min. The precipitated nucleic acids was spun down (13 000 rpm, 10 min) and washed in 70% EtOH, dried and resuspended in 20 µL TE-buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) containing 20 µg/mL RNaseA. The PCR reaction included 25 ng template DNA, Intron Forward (GAT CCC ACC TGC ATCGAT; SEQ ID NO 5; 10µM), Nos-t (AAG ACC GGC AAC AGG ATT C; SEQ ID NO 6; 10µM), 10µM dNTPs (1 µM each), 10x PCR buffer containing 0.37mM MgCl2, and 0.25µL Tag polymerase enzyme (1U) to a final volume of 25 µl. The cycling parameters included incubation of the PCR reaction for 3 mins at 94°C, followed by a 3-step cycle of 94°C for 30 secs, 60°C for 45 secs and 72°C for 2 mins, repeated a total of 30 times. A final elongation step of 5 mins at 72°C was included. For each transformation seven independent regenerated plants that were resistant to geneticin were transferred to soil and hardened off under standard conditions. 2.2 Characterisation of gene expression 2.2.1 Semi-quantitative gene expression analysis of endogenous UMP synthase and NDPase using RT-PCR Suspension cells (tissue culture) as well as internodes (8-10) tissue collected from greenhouse grown mature plants were used for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from all tissues according to a modified method of Bugos et al. (1995). Tissues were cut into small pieces directly into liquid N2 and ground in an IKA® A11 basic analytical mill. The fine powder was transferred to a 50 ml sterile tubes (Corning) in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. Two grams frozen tissue was added to 10 mL homogenisation buffer (0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, 1% SDS (w/v), 0.1% BME) and 10 mL phenol:chloroform (1:1) in a 50 mL tube and vortexed. Sodium acetate, pH 5.2, was added to a final concentration of 0.1 M and the emulsion was incubated on ice for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 4 °C (12 000 g, 15 min). The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube containing 3 volumes 100% EtOH and 0.1 volume 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, mixed and precipitated at -20 °C for two hours. The precipitated nucleic acid was spun down at 4 °C (12000 g, 15 min) and washed in 75% EtOH. Samples were resuspended in water and treated with Deoxyribonuclease I (RNase-free, Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by precipitation in 2.5 volumes 100% EtOH, 0.1 volume sodium acetate. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine whether down-regulation of UMP synthase transcription resulted in up-regulation of transcripts coding for salvage enzymes such as NDPase. Five µg total RNA obtained from mature internode tissues of transgenic sugarcane showing reduced UMP synthase activity was reverse transcribed using the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for amplifying UMPS RNA transcripts were: forward (GCTTGAAGCTGAAGGGTTTG; SEQ ID NO 7) and reverse (ACACAAACGATGATGGAGCA; SEQ ID NO 8); for nucleoside diphosphate phosphatase (NDPase) were: forward (AAGGCCTTGAAGCTTGTGAA; SEQ ID NO 9) and reverse (TGCAAAGACGCGAAAGTAAA; SEQ ID NO 10); and for the housekeeping actin gene were: forward (ACTGGGACGACATGGAGAAG; SEQ ID NO 11) and reverse (TTCTCCACAGAGGAGCTGGT; SEQ ID NO 12). Each PCR reaction contained 0.5 µg cDNA as template. RT-PCR amplification of the housekeeping gene α-Actin was carried out to normalize the amount of template cDNA. Five transgenic sugarcane lines were selected for further analysis based on UMP synthase activity level and regeneration plant availability. These transgenic sugarcane lines were labelled 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 4.2, and are referred to as such hereafter. In further analyses, the transgenic sugarcane lines were compared to the non-transformed or wild-type sugarcane (WT). 2.3 Characterisation of enzyme activity 2.3.1 Protein determination Protein concentrations was determined according to Bradford (1976) using a commercially available protein assay solution (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions.

(1989). One gram of previously stored tissues was added to 1.5mL ice cold 10% HClO4, vortexed and incubated at 4°C for 20 minutes with mixing. Insoluble material was spun down for 2 minutes (13 000 rpm, at 4°C). Following removal of the supernatant, the pellet was washed and incubated for 15 minutes with 500µL 2% HClO4, spun down for 2 minutes (13 000 rpm, 4°C), and pooled with the first supernatant. Samples were neutralized (pH 7.0-7.5) by the addition of 5M KOH, 1 M triethanolamine and incubated at 4°C for 15 minutes. The insoluble KClO4 was spun down for 2 minutes (13 000 rpm) and the neutralized supernatant was filtered in a 0.25µm and used for hexose phosphate quantification. The filtered neutralized supernatant was flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen and freeze dried in a Speed Vac Plus SC11A.

The square of the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (coefficient of determination) was calculated to indicate correlation between characteristics. STATISTICA (data analysis software system), version 8. www.statsoft.com) was used for all statistical analysis. 2.3.10 Bioinformatic analysis of sugarcane UMPS The DNA sequence of sugarcane UMPS (TC68130) was used to carry out a BLAST search for highly similar DNA sequences using the online tools available at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. The regions sequences showing high similarity were each aligned to the sugarcane UMPS DNA using standard web based alignment tools such as that offered by the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute and available online at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/align/index.html. 3 Results 3.1 Confirmation of putative transgenic sugarcane lines The identity of pihUMPS (as shown in the plasmid map of Figure 1) was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion using KpnI and XbaI and resolution of the restricted products by agarose gel electrophoresis. KpnI digestion yielded the expected 4858 bp and 1816 bp fragments, while KpnI and XbaI double-digestion yielded the expected 4838 bp, and 908 bp fragments (Figure 2). To select positively transformed clones, transformants were screened by means of PCR for the presence of the silencing vector (Figure 3). DNA was extracted from mature internodes (8-10). For each transformation seven (7) independent regenerated plants that were resistant to geneticin were transferred to soil and hardened off under standard conditions. Five lines were selected for further analysis based on UMPS activity level and regeneration plant availability. 3.2 Characterisation of gene expression 3.2.1 Semi-quantitative gene expression analysis of endogenous UMP synthase (UMPS) and nucleoside diphosphate phosphatase (NDPase) using RT-PCR Down-stream effects of UMPS silencing were expected to include a low transcription level of UMPS and up-regulation of the salvage pathway compared to that of the untransformed wild-type line. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was therefore used to determine whether down-regulation of UMPS transcription resulted in up-regulation of transcripts coding for salvage enzymes such as NDPase. UMPS expression in mature internode tissues of transgenic sugarcane was observed to be less than that observed in the untransformed wild-type line (Figure 4A), while NDPase expression was observed to be greater (Figure 4B). The expression of the housekeeping gene α-Actin was similar in the transgenic sugarcane lines and in the untransformed wild-type line, confirming similar amounts of template cDNA were included in the RT-PCR reactions. 3.3 Characterisation of enzyme activity 3.3.1 Enzyme activity of UMPS Synthase, UK, and UPRTase Both suspension cells and internodal tissue obtained from all five transgenic sugarcane lines demonstrated significantly less UMPS activity than suspension cells and internodal tissue obtained from the wild-type sugarcane (Figure 5), demonstrating successful RNAi-based targeting of UMPS expression. In contrast, enzyme activity of the salvage pathway enzyme UK was found to be significantly lower in suspension cells and internodal tissue obtained from all five transgenic sugarcane lines than that obtained from the wild-type sugarcane line (Figure 6), demonstrating an up-regulation of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. UPRTase activity of suspension cells and internodal tissue obtained from all five transgenic sugarcane lines was generally less than that obtained from the wild-type sugarcane, with suspension cells from transgenic sugarcane lines 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 4.2 showing significantly less UPRTase activity (Figure 7). 3.3.2 Enzyme activity of Sucrose Synthase (SuSy) Crude desalted protein extracts from suspension cells and internodes 8-10 obtained from transgenic cell lines were analysed to determine SuSy activity. SuSy activity analysed in the breakdown direction was observed to be generally increased in suspension cells obtained from transgenic sugarcane lines 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 and generally decreased in transgenic sugarcane lines 2.2, and 4.2 (Figure 8). SuSy activity analysed in the synthesis direction was observed to be generally increased in suspension cells obtained from transgenic sugarcane lines 3.1 and 3.3 and generally decreased in transgenic sugarcane lines 2.2, 3.2, and 4.2 (Figure 8). However, SuSy activity analysed in both the breakdown and synthesis directions was observed to be significantly decreased in internodal tissue obtained from all the transgenic sugarcane (Figure 9). SuSy activity of suspension cells and intermodal tissue of the transgenic sugarcane lines was assessed under maximal (Vmax) and limiting (Vlim) conditions and compared to that of the untransformed-wild-type line. The SuSy Vmax of suspension cells from transgenic sugarcane lines 3.1 and 3.2 was significantly greater than that of the untransformed wild-type line (Table 1). Furthermore, both the Vmax and the Vlim of all the transgenic cell lines were significantly greater than that observed for the untransformed wild-type line (Table 1).

Suspension cells obtained from transgenic sugarcane lines 2.2, 3.2, and 3.3 demonstrated significantly more UGPase activity than suspension cells obtained from the wild-type sugarcane, while internodal tissue obtained from transgenic sugarcane lines 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 4.2 demonstrated significantly less UGPase activity (Figure 11). 3.3.4 Sucrose, hexose and starch accumulation in transgenic sugarcane lines The effect of RNAi-based targeting of UMPS expression on the accumulation of sucrose, glucose, fructose and starch in transgenic sugarcane, metabolites was assessed. The sucrose content of all transgenic sugarcane lines was observed to be significantly greater than that observed in the untransformed wild-type line in both suspension cells and intermodal tissue (Figure 12), and starch content was significantly increased in suspension cells from all transgenic sugarcane lines (Figure 13). Starch content in intermodal tissue obtained from transgenic sugarcane lines 3.2 and 4.2 was also observed to be significantly greater than the untransformed wild-type line (Figure 13). Glucose and fructose content of the transgenic sugarcane lines was also assessed and the glucose content was observed to be significantly increased in the suspension cells from clones 2.2 and 3.1, and in the internodal tissue of clone 3.2 (Figure 14). Fructose content however not observed to be significantly different between the transgenic sugarcane lines and the untransformed wild-type line (Figure 15). 3.3.5 Metabolites analysis using linear correlation Sucrose and starch contents were plotted against key metabolites to determine a possible relationship in both the suspension cells and the internodes. In the suspension cells, UDP-glucose, hexose phosphates and total uridinylates (UDP and UDP-glucose) positively correlated with increase in sucrose content in all transgenic lines with the strongest positive correlation (R2 = 0.68) observed between sucrose and both hexose phosphate and total uridinylates (Figure 16 B and D, respectively). No significant correlation was observed between sucrose and hexoses, however, changes in starch content positively correlated with increase in hexose phosphate and total adenine nucleotides (Figure 16 E and F). In the internodes, a significant positives correlation was observed in all transgenic lines between sucrose and both total uridinylates and hexose phosphates (Figure 17 A and B, respectively). Sucrose and both hexose and UDP-glucose, as well as starch and both hexose phosphates and total adenyltes, on the other hand, demonstrated very weak correlations in all plants (Figure 17). 3.3.6 Metabolites and key enzymes analyses using linear correlation Sucrose and total uridinylates were plotted against the activities of key enzymes to determine a possible relationship in both the suspension cells and mature internodes. In the suspension cells, a significant positive correlation was observed between sucrose content and both sucrose phosphate synthase and uridine kinase activities (Figure 18 A and B, respectively). However, increase in sucrose content negatively correlated with changes in UMP synthase activity in all transgenic lines (Figure 18 C; P = 0.665). In the internodes, a similar pattern was observed; an up-regulation of sucrose phosphate synthase activity positively correlated with changes in sucrose accumulation, and a decrease in UMP synthase activity negatively correlated with changes in sucrose content (Figure 19 A and B, P = 0.656 and P = 0.784, respectively). In contrast, an increase in uridine kinase activity did not show a significant correlation with changes in sucrose content; however, changes in uridine kinase positively correlated with an increase in total uridinylates (Figure 19 C and D, respectively). 3.3.5 Bioinformatic analysis of sugarcane UMPS The BLAST search for DNA sequences showing high similarity to the DNA sequence of sugarcane UMPS (TC68130) revealed DNA encoding UMPS enzymes from other sugar-storing plants such as sweet sorghum (Figure 16). The DNA sequence of sweet sorghum (SEQ ID NO 13; XM_002456891.1) was aligned with that of sugarcane and showed high similarity (85.5%) (Figure 17). 4. Discussion In the work shown here, intron-spliced hairpin RNA vector technology was used to construct an RNAi vector for sugarcane embryonic calli transformation. Five lines transformed with the ihpRNA vector (pihUMPS) were generated. To assess the effect of repressed UMP synthase, the enzyme activities and metabolite levels of pathways surrounding the main carbohydrates, starch and sucrose, were determined. PCR and RT-PCR analyses confirmed the integration of the construct into the sugarcane transgenic lines, and indicated that the transformed lines had decreased the UMP synthase transcript level, respectively. Protein assays showed a repression of up to 62% of the activity of UMP synthase, which correlated well with transcript level found in all transgenic lines compare to the untransformed wild-type control. The data demonstrated that repression of UMP synthase activity in transgenic sugarcane plants led to significant up-regulation of one of the pyrimidine salvage enzymes (UK), increases in sucrose, UDP-glucose, starch, and in the concentration of the hexose phosphate pools, as well as SPS, the main enzyme responsible for sucrose synthesis. The work described illustrates a method of obtaining a sugarcane crop with higher content in both sucrose and starch. It will, however, be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the method described in the current invention may exhibit further characteristics besides the modification of the carbohydrate content of a plant; it will further be appreciated that modifications may be introduced to the method without diverging beyond the scope of the invention. 5.
