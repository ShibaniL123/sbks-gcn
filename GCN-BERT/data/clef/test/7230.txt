Step 2: Synthesis of 8-chlorobenzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]furan
Next, 4.5 g (16 mmol) of 1-(3-chloro-2-fluorophenyl)-2-naphthol, 80 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and 4.4 g (32 mmol) of potassium carbonate were put into a 500 mL three-neck flask. This flask was subjected to stirring at 150Â° C. for 2 hours under a nitrogen stream. After the stirring, this mixture was cooled down to room temperature and added to approximately 200 mL of toluene, and approximately 100 mL of water was added to the mixture. The aqueous layer of the mixture was subjected to extraction with toluene, and the solution of the extract and the organic layer were combined and washed with dilute hydrochloric acid (1.0 mol/L) and a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate, and after the drying, this mixture was gravity-filtered. The obtained filtrate was concentrated to give an oily substance. The obtained oily substance was dissolved in approximately 50 mL of toluene, and this solution was subjected to suction filtration through Celite, alumina, and Florisil. A solid obtained by concentrating the resulting filtrate was recrystallized from toluene/hexane to give 3.2 g of target white needle-like crystals in a yield of 79%. The synthesis scheme of Step 2 is shown in (a-2) below.
