It is often desirable to provide a water-insoluble compound in a waterborne composition. One possible approach to this goal is to attempt to form an emulsion of droplets in water, where the droplets contain the water-insoluble compound and where those droplets are stabilized by an emulsifier. In such an emulsion, it is sometimes also desirable that the emulsifier is reactive and capable of acting as a crosslinker U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,377 describes a preparation that contains an aliphatic polyisocyanate and an emulsifier. It is desired to provide a compound that has one or more isocyanate groups and that is capable of acting as an emulsifier for stabilizing emulsions of water-insoluble compounds. Also desired are emulsions made of such water-insoluble compounds and such emulsifiers. It is further desired to provide a compound that has two or more isocyanate groups and that is capable of acting as an emulsifier for stabilizing emulsions of water-insoluble aromatic polyisocyanates. Also desired are emulsions made of such aromatic polyisocyanates and such emulsifiers. The following is a statement of the invention. The first aspect of the present invention is a composition comprising one or more compound having the structure of formula II: wherein A is a residue of a polyisocyanate,L is a linking group formed by a reaction of an isocyanate group with an isocyanate-reactive group,n is 5 to 25,m is 0 to 100, andZ is methyl or ethyl or propyl, and wherein the ratio of the sum of the moles of isocyanate groups plus the moles of said L groups to the moles of said Z groups is 2:1 to 30:1. The second aspect of the present invention is an emulsion comprising particles suspended in an aqueous medium, wherein said particles comprise (b) one or more compound having the structure of formula II: and (c) one or more water-insoluble compound that does not have the structure A-NCO, wherein A is a residue of a polyisocyanate, the meaning of A is the same in (b) and (c), L is a linking group formed by a reaction of an isocyanate group with an isocyanate-reactive group, n is 5 to 25, m is 0 to 100, and Z is methyl or ethyl or propyl, and wherein the ratio of the sum of the moles of isocyanate groups plus the moles of said L groups to the moles of said Z groups is 2:1 to 30:1. The following is a detailed description of the invention. As used herein, the following terms have the designated definitions, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The isocyanate group is —NCO. A polyisocyanate is a compound having two or more isocyanate groups. Some polyisocyanates are polymers and some are not. A diisocyanate is a compound that has exactly two isocyanate groups. The structure of a diiosocyanate is OCN—R—NCO, where R is any organic group, which may be substituted or unsubstituted. If R is aliphatic, the diisocyanate is an aliphatic diisocyanate. If R contains any aromatic ring, the diisocyanate is an aromatic diisocyanate. A dimer of a diisocyanate has the structure VI: Because structure VI is the dimer of a diisocyanate, the R groups in structure VI are identical to each other. A diisocyanate that is not a dimer of any diisocyanate is known herein as a monomer of a diisocyanate. A trimer of a diisocyanate has the structure III: Because structure III is the trimer of a diisocyanate, the R groups in structure III are identical to each other. As used herein, a “residue” of a polyisocyanate is what remains of the structure of that polyisocyanate when a single isocyanate group is disregarded. A polyisocyanate has the structure A-NCO, where A is the residue of the polyisocyanate. The residue of a polyisocyanate has at least one isocyanate group. For Example, structure III may be re-drawn to have the structure AT-NCO, where AT is the residue of the trimer of a diisocyanate. In this example, AT has two isocyanate groups. As used herein, an isocyanate-reactive group is a group that is capable of reacting with an isocyanate group. A linking group is the group formed when an isocyanate group reacts with an isocyanate-reactive group. For example, when an isocyanate group reacts with a hydroxyl group or with an amine group, the resulting linking group is a urethane group or a urea group, respectively. The urethane group has structure IV: As used herein, an epoxy compound is a compound having one or more epoxy group. A polyepoxy compound is a compound having two or more epoxy groups. A polyepoxy compound may or may not be a polymer. As used herein a crosslinker is a compound that has two or more reactive groups and that is capable of reacting with reactive groups attached to polymer chains to form crosslinks between polymer chains. The reactive groups on the crosslinker may be the same as or different from the reactive groups attached to the polymer chains. An aqueous medium is a continuous medium that contains 50% or more water by weight based on the weight of the continuous medium. As used herein, an emulsion is a dispersion of particles distributed through an aqueous medium. The particles in an emulsion may have weight-average particle diameter of 10 nm to 10 micrometer. Weight-average particle diameter herein is known as D50. A compound is considered herein to be water-insoluble if the maximum amount of that compound that can dissolve in 100 g of water at 25° C. is 0.5 grams. As used herein, the statement that a ratio is X:1 or higher means that the ratio is Y:1, where Y is equal to or greater than X. Similarly, the statement that a ratio is Z:1 or lower means that the ratio is W:1, where W is equal to or less than Z. The composition of the present invention preferably contains a polyisocyanate, herein refereed to as “polyisocyanate (a).” Polyisocyanate (a) has the structure I: [in-line-formulae]A-NCO I[/in-line-formulae] where A is the residue of polyisocyanate (a). Preferably, polyisocyanate (a) is a monomer of a diisocyanate, a dimer of a diisocyanate, or a trimer of a diisocyanate. More preferably, polyisocyanate (a) is a trimer of a diisocyanate. Certain diisocyanates are preferred for use in polyisocyanate (a). The same diisocyanates are preferred whether used as a monomer of a diisocyanate or as the building blocks for a dimer of a polyisocyanate or a trimer of a polyisocyanate. Preferred diisocyanates for use in polyisocyanate (a) are aliphatic diisocyanates. More preferred are 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane (IPDI), 4,4′-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane (H12MDI), and di-isocyanatomethyl-cyclohexane (ADI). More preferred are HDI and ADI; most preferred is HDI. In preferred embodiments, polyisocyanate (a) is a trimer of a diisocyanate (herein called “trimer (a)”) having structure III. Trimer (a) has the structure I: [in-line-formulae]AT-NCO I[/in-line-formulae] In trimer (a), residue AT- has the structure V: The diisocyanate of which trimer (a) is the trimer is known herein as “diisocyanate (a).” The composition of the present invention contains a compound (herein called “compound (b)”) having structure II: where A in structure II is a residue of a polyisocyanate. When a polyisocyanate (a) is present, A in structure II is identical to A in structure I; L is a linking group formed by a reaction of an isocyanate group with an isocyanate-reactive group, n is 5 to 50, m is 0 to 100, and Z is methyl or ethyl or propyl.

The composition of the present invention comprises a mixture of polyisocyanate (a) and compound (b). This mixture may be characterized by a ratio M-ISO:M-Z. As used herein M-ISO is the sum of the moles of NCO groups plus the moles of L groups. M-Z is the moles of Z groups. The ratio M-ISO:M-Z may be illustrated by an example. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention is made by a process that includes a chemical reaction between a polyisocyanate (a) and a compound having structure HO—(CH2CH2O)n—CH3. In such embodiments, an NCO group on trimer (a) reacts with the OH group on the other compound. When contemplating such a chemical reaction, it is useful to characterize reactants prior to the chemical reaction by examining the ratio (herein called the NCO:OH ratio) of the moles of NCO groups on the trimer (a) to the moles of OH groups on the other compound. In this example, the moles of Z groups is the moles of methyl groups, which is the same as the moles of OH groups. In this example, during the chemical reaction, some or all of the NCO groups will react with some or all of the OH groups, and so some or all of the NCO groups will be converted into urethane groups (the L groups in this example). The quantity M-ISO will be the same as the number of moles of NCO groups present in the reactants prior to the chemical reaction. The ratio M-ISO:M-Z of the products after the chemical reaction is the same as the ratio NCO:OH of the reactants prior to the reaction. M-ISO:M-Z is 2:1 or higher; preferably 4:1 or higher; more preferably 5:1 or higher; more preferably 6:1 or higher.
