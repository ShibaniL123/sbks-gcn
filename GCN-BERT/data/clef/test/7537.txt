TECHNICAL FIELD The disclosure generally relates to surgical instrument receptacle, organizational system and, more specifically, is related to a stringer and tray system for retaining a collection of surgical instruments for sterilization, transport and storage. BACKGROUND Present day surgical procedures regularly use sets of pre-selected surgical instruments for a specified surgical procedure, such as clamps, hemostat, forceps, scissors, retractors, and the like. These instruments are regularly grouped together to form a set. The set of surgical instruments is stored in a sterilized condition until required for surgery. Prior to sterilization the set of surgical instruments is subject to a time consuming multi-step sorting, identifying, grouping, cleaning and sterilization process. The set of surgical instruments is collected post operation, co-mingled in a wire mesh basket or holed tray for transport to the central sterile processing area. Next, the basket or tray of surgical instruments is placed in a wash sink to brush and manually wash the surgical instruments to remove any foreign debris, such as tissue or dried body fluid. Next, the basket or tray of surgical instruments is transported to and run through an automated washer/decontaminator. Next, the basket or tray of surgical instruments is transported to and emptied out on a sorting table where a technician inspects, counts and sorts each surgical instrument into groupings of instruments for a specified surgical procedure. Next, pivoting or hinged scissor-like surgical instruments are commonly sequentially grouped using a fixed stringer, bar or retaining rod positioned through both of the finger rings or ring handles, and the set is laid or positioned in a basket or tray. Next, the basket or tray of surgical instruments is placed in a sealed container and sealed before entering the sterilization machine. Next, the wrapped or containerized basket or tray of surgical instruments is placed in an industrial sterilization machine/autoclave for sterilization of the surgical instruments. Next, the sealed sterilization container of surgical instruments is stored until transported to an operating area for use as required. When needed the sterilized surgical instruments are transported to the operating room where the surgical instruments are removed from the basket or tray and arranged on a stand or instrument roll in a configuration that enables efficient transfer to a surgeon. Much time is utilized during the process of cleaning, sorting, counting, and grouping procedure for the assembly and sterilization of surgical instruments. In addition, the onset of infectious diseases has dramatically increased the biohazard risk for medical personnel and central sterile personnel handling post operation cleaning, sorting, counting, and grouping of surgical instruments due to potential contact with sharp surgical instruments, such as needles. Such contact may result in loss of work for recovery, testing for contamination, and/or a workers compensation claim. Furthermore, surgical instruments are often damaged when transported, stacked one on the other as well as when the surgical instruments are emptied out on a sorting table for a technician to inspect, count, and sort. Such handling may scratch, bend and may even break the surgical instruments resulting in increased cost to replace such instruments, which are often delicate and expensive. Such damage to the surgical instruments reduces the life expectancy of the surgical instruments resulting in increased medical costs to replace the surgical instruments. Moreover, if such damaged surgical instruments are accidentally returned to the operating room, such surgical procedures may be delayed or cancelled due to non-functioning surgical instruments causing lost revenue for the surgery center and an upset surgical team and patients in queue. Still further, the environmental impact of the above multi-step process of pre-washing, automated washer/decontaminator, and running the surgical instruments through industrial sterilization machine/autoclave requires large quantities of water, sterilization chemicals and energy. Yet still further, counting the surgical instruments before and after surgical procedures is particularly important for ensuring that no instruments are left in the patient after the operation procedure has been completed. Yet still further, one problem with fixed or hinged stringers, bars or retaining rods is that the stringer is not adjustable to string, group or accommodate a variety of surgical instruments nor do such fixed stringers enable adjustment to hold or maintain a variety of surgical instruments in an open position ready for sorting, identifying, grouping, cleaning and sterilization. Therefore, it is readily apparent that there is a recognizable unmet need for an adjustable surgical instrument stringer with pegs and tray system and method of sterilization that reduces the time spent cleaning, sorting, counting, identifying and grouping surgical instrument, extends the life expectancy of the surgical instruments, provides an adjustable stringer, and decreases the contamination potential of the surgical instruments by maintaining the surgical instruments in a side-by-side open configuration during cleaning and sterilization.

Referring now to FIG. 4.1 an exemplary surgical instrument I, such as a hemostat having moveable shank S1 and shank S2, which preferably includes a pair of opposing first jaw member J1 and second jaw members J2, jaw members, wherein at least one of the jaw members is movable relative to the other. Such jaw members may be pivotable about pivot point P, within box lock B, between first open position O in which the jaw members are disposed in a spaced relation relative to one another, and second closed position C in which the jaw members are configured to grasp or clamp something therebetween, such as tissue, or the like. Moreover, opposing first jaw member J1 and second jaw members J2 may be locked or held in position by a lock such as ratchet lock L preferably positioned on an extension stem or support member such as shank S1 and shank S2 between the two ring handles R. In use, for example a user positions their thumb in first ring handle R1 and their index or middle finger within second ring handle R2. By a user opening and closing their thumb and index or middle finger this causes first ring handle R1 and second ring handle R2 to move apart (first open position O) and together (second closed position C), accordingly. The movements of first ring handle R1 and second ring handle R2 causes shank S1 and shank S2 to pivot about pivot point P which results in first jaw member J1 and second jaw members J2 to likewise pivot about pivot point P between first open position O and second closed position C. Further, surgical instruments I may include hemostats, forceps, clamps, scalpels, scissors, picks, retractors, hooks, clips, pliers, punches, curettes, specula and the like, which are generally of high precision and intricate construction and come in a variety of types, shapes and sizes, all of which may be used during a particular surgical procedure. A variety of surgical tools exist for each category of instruments. For example, considering only forceps, they come straight, left curved, right curved, serrated, cupped, etc. In addition, a range of medical, dental and veterinary tools have been developed for each discipline, such as in medicine sub-categories of surgical procedures include anesthesia, cardio, dermatology, ear nose & throat, hand (specific limbs), facial, ob/gyn, orthopedic and the like each discipline having a variety of specialty and common surgical instruments. Over the years, surgical procedures along with the type and quantity of surgical instruments used in a given procedure have become predominantly standardized. Many of the above-mentioned instruments are scissor action instruments, having a pair of ring handles R that are connected through a pivot P to working moveable members shank S1 and shank S2. Preferably, lever, extension or support members such as shank S typically include ring handles R at the ends thereof to facilitate the opening and closing of shank S1 and shank S2 connected to first jaw member J1 and second jaw members J2. Referring now to FIG. 4.2 an exemplary embodiment of a plurality of surgical instruments I strung together by stringer 100A. Preferably rod 101A and rod 101B of stringer 100A are positioned through first ring handle R1 and second ring handle R2 of one or more surgical instruments I to group surgical instruments I in sequential order along y axis Y. Moreover, one exemplary function of the extension and retraction capability of connector 130C/F (shown in FIG. 3) and 130D/E is to enable stringer 100A to accommodate additional (expansion) or fewer (retraction) numbers of surgical instruments I along y axis Y. Such extension and retraction maintains a tight y axis Y fit around ring handles R of the group surgical instruments I and holds the group surgical instruments I in an erect position. Such erect position, space between instruments, and organization of the group surgical instruments I enables shortened time to identify, clean (whether pre-wash, pressure washing or the like), sort, count, group, and sterilize surgical instrument I. Moreover, such erect position, space between instruments, and organization of the group surgical instruments I reduces instrument damage when transporting, stacking, sorting, inspecting, and counting, and additionally when positioning on a sorting table for a technician to inspect, count, and sort. Still further, such extension and retraction of connector 130C/F (shown in FIG. 3) and 130D/E enables stringer 100A to adjust and accommodate a variety of sizes of surgical instruments I1/I2 and numbers or groups of surgical instruments I. It is contemplated herein that first peg 104A.8, second peg 104B.8, third peg 114A.8, and fourth peg 114B.8 may be utilized to raise first ring handle R1 and second ring handle R2 of one or more surgical instruments I above a surface or plug or insert into a holed surface. Procedurally the surgical instruments I should be strung post-surgery when in their aligned position on the surgical instrument roll by feeding stringer 100A through first ring handle R1 and second ring handle R2. Thereafter the surgical instruments I are preferably handled as a group of surgical instruments I bound together by stringer 100A through the multi-step sorting, identifying, grouping, cleaning and sterilization process. Such bundling of surgical instruments I preferably helps to protect surgical instruments I from damage when transported, stacked one on the other as well as when the surgical instruments are emptied out on a sorting table (no longer required) for a technician to inspect, count, and sort. Such handling may scratch, bend and may even break the surgical instruments resulting in increased cost to replace such instruments, which are often delicate and expensive. Moreover, such damage to the surgical instruments reduces the life expectancy of the surgical instruments resulting in increased medical costs to replace the surgical instruments. Furthermore, if such damaged surgical instruments are accidentally returned to the operating room, such surgical procedures may be delayed or cancelled due to non-functioning surgical instruments causing lost revenue for the surgery center and an upset surgical team and patients in queue. Moreover, one exemplary function of the release and latch capability of connectors 130A and 130B (shown in FIG. 3) is to enable stringer 100A to accommodate surgical instruments I in an open position O and upright. Such release and latch of connector 130A and 130B (shown in FIG. 3) maintains x axis X spacing between first ring handle R1 and second ring handle R2 of the group surgical instruments I. Such movement of first ring handle R1 and second ring handle R2 causes shank S1 and shank S2 to pivot about pivot point P which results in first jaw member J1 and second jaw members J2 to likewise pivot about pivot point P. Preferably stringer 100A holds the group surgical instruments I in an erect position with opposing first jaw member J1 and second jaw members J2 held in open position O. Such open position O, spacing between instruments, and organization of the group surgical instruments I enables more thorough cleaning and sterilization of surgical instruments I. In addition, maintaining such open position O between first jaw member J1 and second jaw members J2 preferably reduces the time to sort, identify, inspect, group, clean and sterilize the group surgical instruments I. Moreover, such open position O of the plurality of surgical instruments I strung together by stringer 100A reduces the number of sharps being sent to central sterile and the reduction of accidents associated with needle/sharps injuries retained in a surgical instrument I or hidden in an un organized cluster of surgical instruments I. Such erect position, spacing between instruments, and organization of the group surgical instruments I enables shortened time to identify, clean (whether pre-wash, pressure washing or the like), sort, count, group, and sterilize surgical instrument I. Still further, such release and latch of connector 130A and 130B (shown in FIG. 3) enables stringer 100A to adjust and accommodate a variety of sizes of surgical instruments I and groups of surgical instruments I.

In block or step 820, surgical instruments I may be gathered together on one end of stringer 100, stringer 100 may be contracted or adjusted, and laid as a group of surgical instruments I on bottom 226 of tray bottom 220 and tray top 320 may be positioned on tray bottom 220 wherein the basket-like housing or enclosure maintains surgical instruments I in an organized and secure position for sterilization, transportation and storage for later use. In block or step 830, the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be removed from tray bottom 220 and the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be positioned in or across valleys 650 on tray top 320 by adjusting stringer 100 wherein the surgical instruments I may be retained in parallel or nonparallel, evenly spaced and an open jaw position by surgical instrument support tray system 10. In such position, the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be sprayed and evenly coated with an enzymatic to begin breaking down post-surgery contaminants (pre-washing step 840). In block or step 832, the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be positioned in or across valleys 650 on tray top 320 by adjusting stringer 100A wherein the surgical instruments I may be retained in parallel or nonparallel, evenly spaced and an open jaw position by surgical instrument support tray system 10 by releasably affixing or inserting pegs 104A/B.8/114A/B.8 to or in apertures 340/340A of tray top 320, and configured to accommodate shorter shanked surgical instrument sets IA and longer shanked surgical instrument sets IB, on one stringer 100A in wide open position O for better cleaning and sterilization purposes and to enable easy identification, pressure washing, sorting, counting, and grouping of surgical instruments IA/B. In block or step 840, the grouped surgical instruments I and stringer 100 may be pre-washed by submerging into a detergent pre-wash solution or sonification system. In addition, grouped surgical instruments I may be positioned in valleys 650 (step 830) on tray top 320 by adjusting stringer 100 (step 820) wherein the surgical instruments I may be scrubbed or pressure washed to remove any visible contaminants remaining post-surgery and inspected for completeness (pre-washing step 840). In block or step 850, surgical instruments I may be gathered together on one end of stringer 100, stringer 100 may be contracted or retracted (step 850) with retained parallel spaced and open jaw surgical instruments I, and/or laid as a group of surgical instruments I on bottom 226 of tray bottom 220 and tray top 320 may be positioned on tray bottom 220 wherein the grouped surgical instruments I or basket-like housing or enclosure with surgical instruments I in an organized and secure position and open jaw surgical may be washed in a commercial washer/disinfector (step 845). Since surgical instruments I are retained in parallel, evenly spaced and in an open jaw position this enables even access of detergents and uniform cleaning of surgical instruments I by a commercial washer/disinfector. In block or step 830, the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be removed from tray bottom 220 and the grouped set of surgical instruments I may be positioned in or across valleys 650 on tray top 320 by adjusting stringer 100 wherein the surgical instruments I may be retained in parallel, evenly spaced and an open jaw position by surgical instrument support tray system 10. While retained an assembler inspects, identifies, sorts and counts surgical instruments I (step 835). Since surgical instruments I have been previously retained in parallel, even spaced with open jaw on surgical instrument support tray system 10 an assembler may quickly inspect, identify, sort, count, disengage any of the surgical instruments I for further inspection and operational testing, and finally grouping of surgical instruments I. Moreover, if one or more surgical instruments I is to be removed or added to the bundled or retained set of surgical instruments I the procedure outlined above for stringer attachment device 700 or alternate stringer attachment devices 800 may be utilized to add or remove surgical instruments I. Thus, surgical instrument support tray system 10 and stringer 100/A reduces the time spent cleaning, sorting, counting, identifying and grouping surgical instruments I, extends the life expectancy of the surgical instruments, and enables thorough cleaning and decontamination of the surgical instruments. In addition, surgical instrument support tray system 10 and stringer 100/A preferably reduces the number of sharps being bundled or hidden with the surgical instruments I and being sent to sterile central. In block or step 820 and 850, surgical instruments I may be gathered together on one end of stringer 100/A, stringer 100/A may be contracted with retained parallel spaced and closed jaw surgical instruments I, and laid as a group of surgical instruments I on bottom 226 of tray bottom 220 and tray top 320 and may be positioned on tray bottom 220 wherein the grouped surgical instruments I or basket-like housing or enclosure with surgical instruments I in an organized and secure position and open jaw surgical may be wrapped, containerized (placed in a sterilization container, such as a basket with detachable lid) or stacked for sterile processing/distribution. Surgical instrument support tray(s) system 10 with stringer 100/A retained parallel spaced and open jaw surgical instruments I may be sterilized (step 855) in a commercial sterilizer using steam or other sterilant. The sterilant may access surgical instruments I via a plurality or set of holes such as apertures 240/340/440 in surgical instrument support tray system 10 to enable thorough cleaning and sterilization of surgical instruments. Once sterilized, surgical instrument support tray(s) system 10 with stringer 100 retained parallel spaced and open jaw surgical instruments I may be placed in inventory for future surgical use (step 860).
