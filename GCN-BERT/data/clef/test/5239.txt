Botanical designation: Rosa hybrid. Variety denomination: ‘Poulren021’. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention constitutes a new and distinct variety of garden rose plant which originated from a controlled crossing between the female seed parent, an unnamed seedling, and the male pollen parent, also an unnamed seedling. The two parents were crossed during the summer of 2001 and the resulting seeds were planted in a controlled environment in Fredensborg, Denmark. The new variety, named ‘Poulren021’, originated as a single seedling from the stated cross. The new variety may be distinguished from its male pollen parent and female seed parent primarily by flower coloration and growth habit. The female seed parent is about 150 cm in height, while ‘Poulren021’ is about 90 cm in height. The male pollen parent has flowers which are generally Red Purple 58C while the claimed plant has a flower color of Red-Purple Group 61C. The objective of the hybridization of this rose variety was to create a new and distinct variety for garden use with unique qualities, such as: 1. Uniform and abundant red purple flowers;2. Vigorous, but compact growth when propagated both as a budded rose and on its own roots;3. Exceptional disease resistance; and4. Flowers with strong fragrance. This combination of qualities is not present in previously available commercial cultivars of this type, known to the inventor, and distinguish ‘Poulren021’ from all other varieties of which we are aware. As part of the rose development program, Mogens N. Olesen germinated the seeds from the aforementioned hybridization during winter of 2001 and conducted evaluations on the resulting seedlings in a controlled environment in Fredensborg, Denmark. ‘Poulren021’ was selected in the spring of 2002 by the inventor as a single plant from the progeny of the aforementioned hybridization. Asexual reproduction of ‘Poulren021’ by traditional budding and rooted cuttings was first done by Mogens N. Olesen in the nursery in Fredensborg, Denmark in July, 2002. This initial and other subsequent asexual propagations conducted in controlled environments have demonstrated that the characteristics of ‘Poulren021’ are true to type and are transmitted from one generation to the next. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The accompanying color illustrations show as true as is reasonably possible to obtain in color photographs of this type, the typical characteristics of the buds, flowers, leaves, and stems, of ‘Poulren021’. Specifically illustrated in FIG. 1 of the drawing are flowers at various stages of development, flower petals detached, sepals and reproductive flower parts. FIG. 2 shows a flowering branch, flower buds, bare stems, mature and juvenile leaves. Illustrated plants are 2 years of age. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIETY The following is a description of ‘Poulren021’, as observed in its growth in a field nursery in Marion County, Oreg. Observed plants are 3 years of age, and were grown on their own roots. Color references are made using The Royal Horticultural Society (London, England) Colour Chart, 2001, except where common terms of color are used. For a comparison, several physical characteristics of the rose variety ‘Poulen007’, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 15,197 are compared to ‘Poulren021’ in Chart 1.
