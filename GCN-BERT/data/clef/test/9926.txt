2-amino-1-phenyl-pyrrolo[3,2-b]quinoxaline-3-carboxamide derivates Field of the invention The invention relates to 2-amino-1 -phenyl-pyrrolo[3,2-b]quinoxaline-3-carboxamide derivates, pharmaceutical preparations thereof and their use in the treatment of cancer and intraocular neovascular syndromes. Background of the invention Receptor tyrosine kinases are attractive targets for cancer therapeutics. For instance, the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 is involved in many types of cancer (Cheng N., Brantley D.M. and Chen J., Cytokine Growth Factor Rev., 2002, 13:75-85). Ephrins and their receptors were first identified in studies for neuronal growth during development. Unlike other families of receptor tyrosine kinases, which bind soluble ligands, ephrin receptors interact with cell surface-bound ephrin ligands. Ephrins attach to the cell membrane either through a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol anchor (ephrin A) or a transmembrane domain (ephrin B). Ephrin receptors are likewise divided in two subclasses EphA and EphB, depending on the type of interaction with their ligands ephrin A or B. Ephrins and their receptors have been shown to play an essential role in vascular development during embryogenesis and in adult angiogenesis, as key regulators of vascular assembly, arteriovenous differentiation, and boundary formation. Both EphA and EphB receptors and their ligands are involved in vascular development. Especially, ephrin B2 is expressed in arterial endothelial cells, whereas its cognate receptor, EphB4 is expressed in venous endothelial cells. EphB4 (also named HTK) and its ligand, ephrin B2 (HTKL), play important roles in establishing and determining vascular networks. Blocking this receptor/ligand pair inhibits the end stage of tumour blood vessel formation, as well as causes direct growth inhibition of certain cancers. EphB4 seems to be rather recalcitrant to inhibition. Despite its potential therapeutic importance, few non-peptidic small molecule inhibitors have been reported in the literature up to date (Miyazaki Y. et al., Bioorg Med Chem Lett 2007, 17:250-254; Zhao H. and Huang D., PLoS ONE, 201 1 , Volume 6, Issue 6; Martiny-Baron G. et al., Angiogenesis, 2010, Volume 13, Issue 3, 259-67). The objective of the invention is to provide new 2-amino-1 -phenyl-pyrrolo [3,2-b]quinoxaline-3-carboxamide derivates which particularly comprise a high selectivity to one or more protein kinases, and notably to one or more protein-tyrosine kinases, as well as pharmaceutical preparations thereof and their use in the treatment of cancer and intraocular neovascular syndromes. This objective is attained by the subject-matter of the independent claims.

In vitro evaluation: In the following, compounds 17 and 87 (in the tables) correspond to prior art compounds 1 and 2 of Figure 5 in Zhao H. and Huang D. "Hydrogen Bonding Penalty upon Ligand Binding", PLoS ONE, 201 1 , Volume 6, Issue 6. These were purchased from InterBioScreen. Cell culture and Gl^n determination: MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) and KM1 2 (colon cancer) cells obtained from the UZH Cancer Institute, HOP-92 (lung cancer) cells purchased from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and A498 (kidney cancer) cells obtained from Prof. Krek (Institute of Cell Biology, ETH Zurich) were cultured in Dulbelcco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1 0% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. K562 leukemia cells obtained from Dr. Silvio Hemmi (Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, UZH) were cultured using RPMI medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. All the media was additionally supplemented with 100 units/mL of penicillin, Ι ΟΟμς/ηΊΐ. of streptomycin, 4.5 g/L glucose, 0.1 1 g/L sodium pyrubate and 2mM glutamine and the cells were grown at 37 5C in 5% C02 atmosphere with 80% relative humidity. MDA-MB-231 , HT-29, KM12, HOP-92 and A498 cells were plated at 10,000 cells per well (100 μΙ_ per well) in 96-well culture dishes and allowed to incubate for 24 h. The old media was removed, the cells were washed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and fresh media was added. A 5 mM solution of inhibitor (in 100% DMSO) was serially diluted in the culture media (12 different concentrations were used) and allowed to incubate for 72 h (MDA-MB-231 ) or 48h (A498). Control cells were treated with the same DMSO concentrations. After the incubation period the media was once more removed and the cells were washed with PBS to then be incubated with fresh media containing 86nM resazurin. After 3 hours, the fluorescence was quantified using a fluorescence microplate reader (Biotek, FLx800™) at the respective excitation and emission wavelength of 560 and 590 nm. Resazurin becomes fluorescent under mitochondrial reduction and its emission directly correlates with the metabolic stability of the cells. The measured fluorescence values were corrected from the control samples containing DMSO and IC50 values were determined by plotting the fraction of metabolically active cells against the log of the drug concentration. All measurements were performed at least in triplicate (see table 1 ). In the case of K-562 leukemia cells, they were seeded at a density of 20,000 cells per well in 100μΙ_ of RMPI media in a 96-well microtiter plates. After 24 hours, 12.5 μΙ_ of a 10 fold concentrated drug or DMSO solution in RMPI media was added in every well. After 48 hour incubation, cell viability was studied by measuring the ability of the cells to process resazurin. Resazurin was added to every well to obtain a final concentration of 86nM, and after 3 hours, the fluorescence was quantified using a fluorescence microplate reader (Biotek, FLx800™) at the respective excitation and emission wavelength of 560 and 590nm as described above. All measurements were performed at least in triplicate (see table 1 b). Table 1 a: GUn MDA-MB-231 Table 1 b: GUn K-562 Compound no. GUo (Mmol/I) Compound no.

Cells expressing EphA3 were induced with a 1 mM solution of isopropyl-beta-D- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 12h at 15°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 100mM NaCI, supplemented with protease inhibitors) and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 h, the soluble fraction of EphA3 was purified using HisTrap Q HP columns (GE healthcare), followed by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex75; GE healthcare). The appropriate fractions were combined and concentrated to -10 mg/mL using Amicon filter devices (1 OkDa as cutoff) in a storage solution (1 OOmM sodium chloride and 10mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0, 5% glycerol). The resulting solution was aliquoted and stored at -80°C for further usage. Differential Scanning Fluorimetry: To a 2 μΜ solution of EphA3 in 10mM Tris HCI buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10OmM NaCI, 5X SYPRO Orange fluorescent dye together with the test compounds prediluted in DMSO at a concentration of 20μΜ (1 .4% final DMSO concentration). A final volume of 40μΙ_ was added per well in a 96 well plate and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were centrifuged for 3 min at 450 rcf. The temperature gradient was performed in the range of 25°C-75°C (50 acquisitions per degree at a ramp rate of 4.4°C/s) using a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System.

For IV dosing, each compound was formulated as a clear solution in DMSO/Solutol® HS 15/phosphate- buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) (5/5/90, v/v/v). For PO dosing, compounds were formulated as a homogeneous suspension in DMSO/1 % methylcellulose (5/95, v/v). At the relevant time point, blood samples (300-400 μΙ_) were collected from the mice under general inhalant anaesthesia by cardiac puncture and stored on ice in 0.6 ml_ polypropylene heparin-lithium-coated tubes. Within 1 hour of collection, each tube was centrifuged at 2500 G for 15 minutes at 4°C and harvested plasma stored at -20°C. Compound concentration in plasma at each time point was determined following acetonitrile precipitation of each sample followed by HPLC-MS analysis performed in triplicates, i.e., based on the mean of the compound concentration at that time point in blood samples of three mice. In the following table 6: T1/2 is the terminal elimination half-life following IV and PO dosing (obtained from non- compartmental analysis (NCA) of the plasma data using WinNonLin). Tmax is the time following PO administration at which the maximum concentration is observed (obtained from non-compartmental analysis (NCA) of the plasma data using WinNonLin). Cmax corresponds to the concentration observed at Tmax following PO administration (obtained from non-compartmental analysis (NCA) of the plasma data using WinNonLin). Bioavailability was calculated as the ratio of: [AUCIast(PO)*Dose(IV)] / [AUCIast(IV)*Dose(PO)] where AUCIast is the area under the curve (estimated by summing incremental areas of a series of trapezoids) of a plot of compound concentration versus time, up to the time of the last observation that is greater than the limit of quantification.

The selectivity profiles of compounds 10c, 10d, 10n and 10o are depicted in Figure 1 . Figure 2 (dasatinib), Figure 3 (erlotinib) and Figure 4 (sunitinib) show the selectivity of FDA approved compounds for comparison. The legend applicable to Fig. 2-4 is in Fig. 2. The selectivity profiling of compounds 10c, 10d, 10n and 10o were performed at DiscoveRx in a library of 456 kinases at a concentration of 1 μΜ. Briefly, kinases were mostly expressed as fusion proteins to T7 phase and grown in 24-well blocks in E. Coli (derived from the BL21 strain). The rest of the kinases were expressed in HEK-293 cells and tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Affinity resins were generated by mixing streptavidin-coated magnetic beads with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at 25 °C, followed by biotin and blocking buffer addition (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween 20, 1 mM DTT). Inhibitors were kept at 40x stocks in 100% DMSO and added to the corresponding 384-well plates (40 μΙ_). After 1 hour of incubation at 25 °C while shacking, affinity beads were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. The beads were re-suspended in PBS buffer containing 0.05 % Tween 20 and 0.5 μΜ non- biotinylated affinity ligand, to then be incubated at 25 °C for 30 minutes while shacking. The kinase concentration present in the eluate was determined by qPCR. For further details, see Fabian, et. al., Nat. Biotechnol., 2005, 23 (3), 329-33. NCI 60 cancer cell line screen: This screen was performed as per the description provided at http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/branches/btb/ivclsp.html. The NCI 60 panel cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 2mM L- glutamine at 37° C, 5 % C02, 95 % air and 100 % relative humidity. Cells were seeded at 5,000 - 40,000 cells/well depending on their doubling time. After 24 hours of incubation, DMSO stock solutions of the compounds (400X) were added at 5 different concentrations (in 4, 10 or ½ log serial dilutions). After 48 h cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid (10% or 16% final concentration for adherent cells and suspension cells respectively) and incubated for 60 minutes at 4°C. After discarding the supernatant, plates were washed with water (5x) and air dried. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) solution (100 μΙ) at 0.4 % (w/v) in 1 % acetic acid was added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes at 4°C, followed by washing with 1 % acetic acid (5x) and air drying. The bound stain was solubilized with 10mM trizma base and determined by absorbance measurement on an automated plate reader at a wavelength of 515 nm. The percentage growth inhibition was calculated as followed, being Tz time zero measurements, C control growth measurements and Ti test growth experiments in the present of the drug (see Figure 5 and 6). [(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)] x 100 for concentrations for which Ti>/=Tz [(Ti-Tz)/Tz] x 100 for concentrations for which TkTz. Three dose response parameters were calculated for each cell line. Growth inhibition of 50% (GI50) is calculated from [(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)] x 100 = 50 and corresponds to the drug concentration required in order to reduce by 50% the net protein increase in comparison to the control experiments. Total growth inhibition (TGI) is calculated from Ti = Tz. The LC50 indicates the drug concentration needed to reduce by 50% the measured protein at the end of the drug treatment as compared to that of the beginning and is derived from [(Ti-Tz)/Tz] x 100 = -50."
