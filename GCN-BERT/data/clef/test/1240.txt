3-((2S)-1-(1-(1-((R)-1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-6-yl)-3-methylpiperidin-4-yl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate
Step 1. Tert-butyl (2S)-2-(2-(benzyloxy)-3-methoxy-3-oxopropyl)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate
To the major diastereomer of tert-butyl (2S)-2-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-3-oxopropyl)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate (Example 55, Step 1, 273 mg, 1.0 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) was added benzyl 2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate (0.2 mL, 1.1 eq) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (1 drop). The mixture was allowed to stir for 2 h before being quenched with saturated aq. sodium bicarbonate solution (10 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (25 mL) and the combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, 10 to 40% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to afford the title compound (169 mg, 47% yield).
