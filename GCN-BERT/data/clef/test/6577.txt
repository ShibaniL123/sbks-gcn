Step 2 Synthesis of compound 42c
The compound 42b (886 mg, 1.62 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (4.00 mL) and methanol (4.00 mL). A 1 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (3.23 mL, 3.23 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and then heated to reflux for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. A 2 mol/L aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (1.62 mL, 3.23 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. Tetrahydrofuran and methanol were evaporated. The precipitates were collected by filtration, washed by purified water and ethyl acetate, and dried to afford the compound 42c (660 mg, yield 79%).
