Step 8: N6-(1-acryloylpiperidin-4-yl)-N4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-methoxyquinazoline-4,6-diamine
A solution of N6-(piperidin-4-yl)-N4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-methoxyquinazoline-4,6-diamine mono-trifluoroacetate (258 mg, 0.5 mmol) and triethylamine (202 mg, 2.0 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. After cooling to 0 Â°C, a solution of acryloyl chloride (54 mg, 0.6 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (2 mL) was added dropwise, and then the reaction was continued for another 30 minutes. The reaction was completed, quenched by slowly adding 5% NaHCO3 solution, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The resulting organic phase was washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was separated through silica gel column chromatography to afford the target product (150 mg, 66%).
