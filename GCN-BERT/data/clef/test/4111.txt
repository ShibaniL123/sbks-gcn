7-(4-Cyanonaphthalen-1-yl)thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-2-formic acid (Compound 29)
Synthesis of compound 29-c
Under N2 atmosphere, at -78°C, a solution of 2.5M n-butyl lithium in n-hexane (24mL, 60mmol) was slowly added to a solution of diisopropylamine (6.1g, 60mmol) in anhydrous THF (100mL). The mixture was stirred for 15mins, followed by adding a solution of 3-bromo-4-chloropyridine (9.6g, 50mmol) in anhydrous THF (100mL), further stirred for 1h, followed by adding anhydrous DMF (10mL) and stirred for 30mins. The mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature, followed by adding saturated NH4Cl aq. solution (300mL), the mixture was extracted with EA (300mL×3). The organic phases were combined, washed in turn with water (100mL) and saturated brine (100mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica preparative plate chromatography (PE:EA = 2:1-1:1) to give light yellow solid 29-c (5.9g, yield 54%).
