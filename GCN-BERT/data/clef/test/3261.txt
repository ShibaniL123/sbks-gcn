To a 50-mL round bottom flask, 2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid (500 mg, 3.59 mmol) was added, and suspended in methanol (5 mL) and water (0.8 mL), then potassium hydroxide (400 mg, 7.13 mmol) was added to the suspension, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 100°C for 15 minutes. The reaction solution was returned to room temperature, iodomethane (2.6 mL, 41.8 mmol) was added to the reaction solution, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 100°C for 45 minutes, and then concentrated under reduced pressure until the solvent volume was reduced by half. To the reaction solution, 3 N hydrochloric acid (20 mL) was added, and the produced solid was collected by filtration, washed with water and acetonitrile, and then dried under reduced pressure to obtain the title compound (64.9 mg, 12%) as white powder.
