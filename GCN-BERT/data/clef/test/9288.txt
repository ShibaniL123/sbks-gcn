No. 12/998,715, which is the U.S. National Stage application of PCT/JP2009/007286, filed Dec. 25, 2009, which claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-329632, filed on Dec. 25, 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a process for producing an organolithium compound and a process for producing a substituted aromatic compound, and more particularly to a method for producing an organolithium compound which is suitable for use in a reaction with an electrophilic compound, and a method for producing a substituted aromatic compound by a reaction of an organolithium compound with an electrophilic compound. BACKGROUND ART Substituted aromatic compounds such as aromatic amines, aromatic ethers, aromatic aldoximes and aromatic aldehydes are useful as biologically active substances (pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals), functional materials (liquid crystal materials, electronic materials, optical materials, photographic additives, resins, dyes and the like) or intermediates for the synthesis thereof. There is generally known, as a method for producing a substituted aromatic compound, a method in which an aromatic compound is metalized with lithium, sodium, magnesium or the like to obtain an arylmetal compound, and then the arylmetal compound is reacted with an electrophilic compound. Also, metalization of a halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compound is similarly known. Among metals used for metalization of such aromatic compounds and halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compounds, lithium is applied for the synthesis of various compounds from the viewpoint of a wide range of the applicable aromatic compounds and halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compounds, high reactivity and the like. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a method for producing an organic charge transporting polymer, which includes the step of lithiating a dihalide of N-(substituted)phenylcarbazole with an alkyl lithium and then reacting with boron trihalide. Patent Document 2 discloses a producing method in which 4-substituted-2,6-difluorobenzene having an acetal group is lithiated with an alkyl lithium and then reacted with carbon dioxide to obtain a benzoic acid derivative and acid amide, which are then dehydrated. It is also known that coordinating compounds such as tetramethylethylenediamine, tetramethylpropylenediamine and pentamethyldiethylenetriamine or the like are used so as to activate an organolithium reagent and an organolithium compound. These coordinating compounds may be sometimes chelate-coordinated with an organolithium compound thereby releasing the association state, thus improving the reactivity of the organolithium compound (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 1). However, the addition of these coordinating compounds improves the reactivity of a lithiated compound to be generated, while it causes severe deterioration of the stability. For example, Non-Patent Document 2 discloses that, although a lithiated compound is generated from 1,4-difluorobenzene and n-butyl lithium, the addition of tetramethylethylenediamine causes severe deterioration of the stability of a lithiated compound when compared with the case of no addition. In metalization by lithium and subsequent introduction of an electrophile, the reaction has been carried out under very low temperature conditions (for example, −60° C. or lower and the like) so as to suppress the reactivity of a highly active organolithium compound (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 3 and Non-Patent Document 5), because it is considered that the yield of an organolithium compound or a substituted aromatic compound is considerably decreased when metalization by lithium is carried out under mild temperature conditions (for example, −20° C. to room temperature). In fact, in metalization by lithium under mild temperature conditions in the presence of tetramethylethylenediamine, the product showed low stability and a low yield (see Comparative Example 2 shown below). Furthermore, since a reaction of an organolithium compound with an electrophilic compound is accompanied by heat generation, there was a large problem that a special facility such as a liquid nitrogen bubbling device for cooling so as to achieve a high yield of a substituted aromatic compound is required, resulting in high production cost (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 4). Moreover, in the production at industrial scale, there exist burdens in safety measures, for example, limitation on the use amount of organolithium compound, difficulty in control of an exothermic reaction and the like (paragraphs [0011] and [0012] of Patent Document 3). As described above, in the metalization of an organic compound by lithium and the production of a substituted aromatic compound by introduction of an electrophile into an organolithium compound, there existed the need of the execution of the reaction under very low temperature conditions, and burdens in production costs and safety measures. Recently, intense interest has been shown towards a method in which metalization by lithium is carried out using a tubular flow type reactor such as a microreactor. For example, Patent Document 3 describes a production method in which an arylmetal compound is produced in a continuous flow type reactor in the case of producing an arylmetal compound by deprotonation of an aromatic compound having a hydrogen atom at the ortho-position to a halogen atom or a trifluoromethoxy group, or a halogen-metal exchange of a haloaromatic compound using a metalizing reagent, and reacting an arylmetal compound with an electrophilic reagent. However, this method has such a drawback that cooling costs considerably increase since the synthesis of an arylmetal compound in a continuous flow type reactor and the reaction of an arylmetal compound with an electrophilic reagent must be carried out at very low temperature of about −70° C. to −35° C. Patent Document 4 describes a method for producing a compound useful for drugs, agricultural chemicals, liquid crystals, electrophotographies, dyes and the like, in which a halogen compound is reacted with a lithium reagent for very short residence time to obtain an organolithium compound having an aromatic ring, and then the organolithium compound is reacted with an electrophilic compound immediately before the organolithium compound causes a side reaction such as decomposition. Patent Document 5 describes a method for producing an o-substituted aromatic compound in which lithiation and electrophilic substitution are carried out by a microreactor. This production method discloses that a chelating agent such as tertiary amine can be added so as to activate an organolithium reagent and an organolithium compound. These methods provide the possibility of carrying out the synthesis of an organolithium compound which becomes unstable unless the synthesis is carried out under very low temperature conditions and the reaction of the organolithium compound with an electrophile under mild temperature conditions of 0° C. or higher in some cases. However, these methods require a special mixer such as a micromixer. It is also required to precisely control the residence time in a microtube within a very short time of 0.001 to 5 seconds, and a high-performance liquid feeding device is required because of a large pressure loss of a microreactor. Also, an enormous number of microreactors are required so as to produce a large amount of the objective product because of the very small volume per one reactor usable in the production, and thus high facility costs are required. Furthermore, countermeasures against the phenomenon such as occlusion of a tube and a reactor may become necessary. As described above, in the continuous flow type reactor (including a microreactor), the operational burden and the burden of safety measures, such as precise control of the residence time and occlusion of the tube tend to increase, which may become large obstacles of commercialization.

Advantageous Effects of Invention According to the method for producing an organolithium compound of the present invention, it is possible to considerably improve the stability of an organolithium compound produced through metalization by lithium. This method enables the production of an organolithium compound in a high yield under comparatively mild conditions by considerably decreasing the operational burden and the burden of safety measures. Also, according to the method for producing a substituted aromatic compound of the present invention, it is possible to obtain a substituted aromatic compound in a high yield under comparatively mild conditions by considerably decreasing the operational burden and the burden of safety measures. That is, in a tubular flow type reactor such as a microreactor and a cascade method, defects such as occlusion of transfer tubes among a tube, a reactor and a batch are less likely to arise in the continuous reaction under comparatively mild conditions. In the case of a batch type reaction, the generation of scaling of the reactor can be prevented and thus the reaction can be easily controlled. In case very large stabilization effect of an organolithium compound is exerted, continuation per se can be avoided. Furthermore, according to the production method of the present invention, since a special facility is not required for cooling and the like, production costs can be considerably suppressed. In a tubular flow type reactor, since the diameter of the tube can be increased, production costs can be considerably suppressed. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS The present inventors have intensively studied so as to achieve the above object and found coordinating compounds such as pentamethyldiethylenetriamine, as a substance which has an ability capable of considerably suppressing decomposition, dimerization, oligomerization, polymerization and the like involved in an organolithium compound under comparatively mild temperature conditions, and also can achieve stabilization of an organolithium compound. They have also found that the stabilization of the organolithium compound is not recognized in a bidentate compound such as tetramethylethylenediamine, and the stabilization is specifically carried out by a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or a coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group. They have further studied based on this finding and found that an organolithium compound can be produced in a high yield through a considerable decrease in the operational burden and the burden of safety measures, by reacting an aromatic compound or a halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compound with a lithiating agent under comparatively mild conditions in the presence of a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or a coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group, and that substituted aromatic compound can be obtained in a high yield through a considerable decrease in the operational burden and the burden of safety measures, by reacting the organolithium compound obtained by this production method with an electrophilic compound under comparatively mild conditions. Furthermore, they have found that defects such as occlusion of a tube, a reactor do not arise by reacting in the presence of a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or a coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group, using a tubular flow type reactor such as a flow reactor, under comparatively mild conditions.

Examples thereof include vinyl halides such as vinyl bromide, vinyl chloride, and vinyl fluoride; 1-bromo-1-cyclohexene, 1-bromo-1-cyclooctene and the like. The aromatic compound or halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compound is usually reacted in an amount within a range from 20 to 2,000 mol %, preferably from 20 to 500 mol %, more preferably from 50 to 200 mol %, and particularly preferably from 90 to 120 mol %, based on a lithium element in a lithiating agent. The lithiating agent used in the present aspect is conventionally known.

From the viewpoint of ease of availability and operability, n-butyl lithium and methyl lithium are preferable, and n-butyl lithium is more preferable. In the reaction of an aromatic compound or a halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compound with a lithiating agent in the present aspect, a solvent can be optionally used. Examples of the solvent include n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, tetrahydrofuran, diethylether, diisopropylether, dibutylether, methyl-t-butyl ether, cyclopentyl methyl ether, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, chlorobenzene, N,N-dimethylformamide, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, hexamethylphosphorictriamide, triethylamine, pyridine and the like, and tetrahydrofuran, n-hexane and toluene are used particularly preferably. These solvents can be used alone, or two or more kinds of these solvents can be used in combination. The use amount of the solvent in the present aspect is from 100 liters to 0 liter, preferably from 10 liters to 0.001 liter, and more preferably from 5 liters to 0.01 liter, based on 1 mol of the aromatic compound or halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compound in the step of reacting the aromatic compound or halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compound with a lithiating agent. Examples of the reaction by the lithiating agent in the present aspect include a lithiation reaction by deprotonation and a lithiation reaction by halogen-lithium substitution. In the present aspect, the aromatic compound and lithiating agent are preferably subjected to the lithiation reaction by deprotonation. Herein, “subjecting to the lithiation reaction by deprotonation” means that protons of the aromatic compound are extracted by an organolithium having a high basicity, such as n-butyl lithium or lithiumdiisopropylamide, lithiumamide or the like to produce an aromatic lithium compound in which proton and lithium are exchanged. It was necessary that the reaction of the aromatic compound or halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compound with the lithiating agent in the prior art was carried out at very low temperature so as to prevent a decrease in yield of the organolithium compound. However, in the present aspect, the organolithium compound can be obtained in a high yield without adjusting to very low temperature. That is, the reaction of the aromatic compound or halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compound with the lithiating agent in the present aspect can be carried out under temperature conditions within a range from −40 to 40° C., preferably from −40° C. to 20° C., and more preferably from −20° C. to 10° C. The reaction can be carried out by a batch type reactor, a continuous batch type (cascade type) reactor, a continuous flow type reactor (including a microreactor) and the like. Although details are unclear, it is considered that, in the liquid containing the organolithium compound produced by the reaction of the aromatic compound or halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compound with the lithiating agent in the present aspect, the coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or the coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group, allowed to exist at the time of the reaction, is chelate-coordinated with a lithium element in the organolithium compound. It is estimated that the organolithium compound can be obtained in a high yield even under mild conditions by the production method of the present aspect since the stability of the organolithium compound is specifically enhanced by chelate-coordinating of the coordinating compound with the organolithium compound, and thus decomposition, dimerization and oligomerization of the organolithium compound are suppressed. Next, a method for producing a substituted aromatic compound according to the second aspect of the present invention will be described. With respect to the same matters as in the above first aspect, repetitive descriptions are omitted. The method for producing a substituted aromatic compound of the present aspect includes the steps of reacting an aromatic compound with a lithiating agent in the presence of a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or a coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group, at a temperature of 40° C. or lower (preferably from −60 to 40° C., and more preferably from −40 to 40° C.) to obtain an organolithium compound, and reacting the organolithium compound obtained in the above step with an electrophilic compound at a temperature of −40° C. to 40° C. The coordinating compound is preferably a compound represented by formula (1) or (2). It is possible to use, as the aromatic compound, those described in the first aspect, and monocylic aromatic compounds are preferable. It is possible to respectively use, as the lithiating agent, those described in the first aspect. The aromatic compound and lithiating agent are preferably subjected to a lithiation reaction by deprotonation. In the step of obtaining the organolithium compound, a solvent can be optionally used in the reaction of the aromatic compound with the lithiating agent. It is possible to respectively use, as the solvent, those described in the first aspect in the use amount similar to the use amount described in the first aspect.

A solvent can be optionally used in the reaction of the organolithium compound with the electrophilic compound in the present aspect. Examples of the solvent include n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, tetrahydrofuran, diethylether, diisopropylether, dibutylether, methyl-t-butylether, cyclopentyl methyl ether, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, chlorobenzene, N,N-dimethylformamide, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, triethylamine, pyridine and the like. These solvents may be used alone, or two or more kinds of these solvents can be used in combination. Among these solvents, a polar solvent is preferable from the viewpoint of satisfactory balance between stability and reactivity, and tetrahydrofuran is particularly preferable. The use amount of the solvent in the step of reacting the organolithium compound with the electrophilic compound is preferably from 100 liters to 0 liter, more preferably from 10 liters to 0.001 liter, and still preferably from 5 liters to 0.01 liter, based on 1 mol of the organolithium compound. It was necessary that reaction of the organolithium compound with the electrophilic compound in the prior art was carried out at very low temperature so as to prevent a decrease in yield. However, in the present aspect, the substituted aromatic compound can be obtained in a high yield without adjusting to very low temperature. The reaction of the organolithium compound with the electrophilic compound in the present aspect can be carried out under temperature conditions within a range from −40 to 40° C., preferably from −40° C. to 20° C., and more preferably from −20° C. to 10° C. The reaction can be carried out by a batch type reactor, a continuous batch type (cascade type) reactor, a continuous flow type reactor (including a microreactor) and the like. The reaction of the organolithium compound with the electrophilic compound in the present aspect is preferably carried out by maintaining a state where the electrophilic compound is more excessive than the organolithium compound. Herein, the “excess state” means that the organolithium compound synthesized separately is brought into contact with a large amount of the electrophilic compound little by little. Specifically, it is preferred to react by dropping a solution containing an organolithium compound in a solution containing an electrophilic compound. There is no particularly limitation on the dropping rate. However, the dropping rate is preferably controlled so that the organolithium compound dropped is not reacted with the solvent, not dimerized or oligomerized, or the organolithium compound is not further reacted with the produced substituted aromatic compound, and more preferably controlled so that the organolithium compound is completely consumed by contact with the electrophilic compound within a short time. In case the above lithiation reaction and this electrophilic reaction by dropping are continuously carried out, it is preferred that the amount required for dropping in the electrophilic reaction of the organolithium compound is sequentially obtained by the lithiation reaction using a continuous tubular flow type reactor or the like and the obtained organolithium compound is immediately subjected to the electrophilic reaction without being accumulated as possible (see, for example, Example 4) Although details are unclear, it is estimated that the substituted aromatic compound can be obtained in a high yield even under mild conditions by the production method of the present aspect since the stability of the organolithium compound is enhanced by chelate-coordinating of the coordinating compound specified in the present aspect with the organolithium compound, and thus decomposition, dimerization and oligomerization of the organolithium compound are suppressed, resulting in an increase of the amount of the organolithium compound to be reacted with the electrophilic compound. Next, the third aspect of the present invention will be described. With respect to the same matters as in the above first or second aspect, repetitive descriptions are omitted. The third aspect of the present invention is use of a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or a coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group, in a continuous flow type reactor, as an occlusion-preventing agent or a residence time extending agent in the production of an organolithium compound, or the production of a substituted aromatic compound by a reaction of an organolithium compound with an electrophilic compound. The coordinating compound is preferably a compound represented by formula (1) or (2). The organolithium compound is preferably produced based on the first aspect. The substituted aromatic compound is preferably produced based on the second aspect. The “continuous flow type reactor” means a general device in which a reagent is continuously introduced into a tubular reactor and a desired reaction is allowed to arise during which the reagent passes through the reactor, and then the reactant is continuously taken out from the tubular reactor and includes, for example, a microreactor, a flow reactor and the like. The “occlusion-preventing agent” means an additive used to prevent non-smooth flow of a reagent through a tube as a result of occlusion caused by adhesion and accumulation of a by-product, an oligomer, a polymer and a slurry having a high viscosity to a continuous flow type reactor through which the reagent is passed, a transfer tube for connecting reaction vessels and the like. The “residence time extending agent” means an additive used to prevent adverse influences such as occlusion of a tube, an increase in viscosity of a reagent, which obstruct flow of the reagent to be transferred, in the case of prolonging the residence time of the reagent in a continuous flow type reactor, a transfer tube and the like, or reopening flow of the reagent after stopping transfer for a long time. Next, the fourth aspect of the present invention will be described. With respect to the same matters as in the above first to third aspects, repetitive descriptions are omitted. The fourth aspect of the present invention is use of a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or a coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group, as a reaction runaway inhibitor or a scaling inhibitor in the production of an organolithium compound, or the production of a substituted aromatic compound by a reaction of an organolithium compound with an electrophilic compound. The “reaction runaway inhibitor” means an additive used to control an exothermic reaction by suppressing an increase in a reaction rate of a reagent, thereby suppressing foaming, boiling and the like, and inhibiting an adverse influence such as deterioration of quality of a product due to runaway of a reaction. The “scaling inhibitor” means an additive used to inhibit adverse influences such as decrease in stirring efficiency and heat transfer efficiency, deterioration of cleaning operability, quality deterioration of the product as a result of adhesion of a reagent to a vessel caused by oligomerization, polymerization, insolubilization and the like in the batch type reaction vessel and the like. Next, a ligand according to the fifth aspect of the present invention will be described. With respect to the same matters as in the above first or second aspect, repetitive descriptions are omitted. The ligand of the present aspect is represented by the following formula (3): wherein, in formula (3), L2b represents —O— or —N(—CH2—R21)—, R21 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-6 alkyl group, L1b represents —OR22 or —N(R23)R24, L3b represents —OR221 or —N(R231)R241, R22 and R221 each, independently, represents a C1-6 alkyl group, R23 and R231 each, independently, represents a methyl group, an ethyl group, or an n-propyl group, R24 and R241 each, independently, represents a C1-6 alkyl group (provided that when L2b is —O— and L1b is —OR22, L3b is —N(R231)R241 and, when L2b is —O— and L3b is —OR221, L1b is —N(R23)R24), n1b and n2b each, independently, represents an integer of 1 to 3, R1b and R2b represent a C1-6 alkyl group, R3b to R8b each, independently, represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-6 alkyl group (provided that when L2b is —N—CH3, L1b and L3b is —N(CH3)CH3 and n1b and n2b are 1, R1b to R8b are not simultaneously methyl groups) and may form a ring between (R1b or R2b) and (R3b or R4b) or may form a ring between (R5b or R6b) and (R7b or R8b). The ring formed between (R1b or R2b) and (R3b or R4b), or ring formed between (R5b or R6b) and (R7b or R8b) can be an alicycle, an aromatic ring, or a hetero ring. EXAMPLES The present invention will be specifically described by way of Examples and Comparative Examples, but the present invention is not limited to these Examples. Examples 1 to 2 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6 Test Method A Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran (containing 6 g of o-xylene as an internal standard), 35.0 mmol of a coordinating compound shown in Table 1 (a coordinating compound is not used in Comparative Example 1) and 6.06 g (33.3 mmol) of 3,4-difluoro-benzotrifluoride were charged in a reaction vessel equipped with a dropping funnel and a stirrer and then cooled to −50° C. After adding dropwise 15.1 g (35.0 mmol) of n-butyl lithium (1.6 mol/L hexane solution) at −50° C., the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour to obtain a solution containing 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethyl-phenyl lithium. Next, this solution was heated to 0° C. and then stirred at the same temperature for 5 hours. A small amount of a sample was extracted from the solution and dissolved in methanol. By dissolution in methanol, 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethyl-phenyl lithium was protonated to obtain a product containing 3,4-difluoro-benzotrifluoride (DFBT) as a main component. Using high-performance liquid chromatography (hereinafter abbreviated to HPLC), the production amount (%) of DFBT was quantitatively analyzed. The results are shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the solution was left to stand at −15° C. for the time shown in Table 1. Then, the residual amount (%) of 3,4-difluoro-benzotrifluoride (DFBT) was quantitatively analyzed in the same manner as in above. The results are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Amount of DFBT (%) After leaving to After stand at −15° C. stirring at (Standing time is 0° C. for shown in Coordinating compound 5 hours parentheses.) Example 1 94 82 (32 hours) Example 2 96 89 (22 hours) Comparative — 84 25 (18 hours) Example 1 Comparative Example 2 87 29 (22 hours) Comparative i-Pr2NH 65 27 (22 hours) Example 3 Comparative Example 4 61 — Comparative Example 5 46 — Comparative Example 6 60 — As is apparent from a comparison between Examples 1 to 2 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6, in the case of using a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, the amount of denaturation into a by-product such as an oligomer is suppressed when compared with the case of using the other coordinating compounds. This reveals that the coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, considerably improve the stability of a lithiated compound even under mild conditions (0° C., −15° C.). Example 3 Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 1.60 g (10 mmol) of bis[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl]ether was dissolved by adding to 2 mL of hexane. After cooling to −15° C., 6.25 mL (10 mmol) of n-butyl lithium (1.6 mol/L hexane solution) was added dropwise while maintaining at −15° C. to −5° C., followed by stirring for 15 minutes. To this mixture, 820 mg (5 mmol) of 4-fluoro-benzotrifluoride was added dropwise while maintaining at −15° C. to −5° C. After completion of the dropwise addition, the mixture was reacted at −15° C. for 1.5 hours to obtain a solution containing 2-fluoro-(5-trifluoromethyl)-phenyl lithium. To this solution, 1.56 g (15 mmol) of trimethoxyborane was added dropwise at −15° C. to −10° C. After completion of the dropwise addition, this reaction solution was heated to room temperature and 10 mL of 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added thereto. After extraction with ethyl acetate, the organic layer was washed with saturated saline and dried over magnesium sulfate. The residue was filtered and concentrated to obtain 1-fluoro-(4-trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid in a yield of 69%. Comparative Example 7 In the same manner as in Example 3, except that bis[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl]ether was replaced by tetrahydrofuran, an attempt was made to carry out a reaction. As a result, the reaction solution caused color change into brown. After 30 minutes have passed since the initiation of the reaction, HPLC analysis was carried out. As a result, a large amount of by-product, which cannot be identified, was produced and only 43% of 4-fluoro-benzotrifluoride existed, and thus an isolation operation was abandoned. As is apparent from a comparison between Example 3 and Comparative Example 7, use of bis[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl]ether enables lithiation and introduction of an electrophile under mild conditions at a temperature which is not very low temperature. It is considered that the yield can highly maintained even under mild reaction conditions (−15° C.) like Example 3 since the stability of a lithiated compound such as 2-fluoro-(5-trifluoromethyl)-phenyl lithium produced by lithiation of bis[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl]ether is improved. Accordingly, it is considered that the coordinating compound capable of improving the stability of the lithiated compound shown in Examples 1 and 2, i.e. a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or a coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group, enables lithiation and introduction of a electrophile under mild conditions at a temperature which is not very low temperature. Example 4 In a 1.0 mmφ tubular flow type reactor A adjusted at a temperature of −4° C., a tetrahydrofuran solution of 3,4-difluoro-benzotrifluoride having the concentration of 1.76 mol/L and bis[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl]ether having the concentration of 1.60 mol/L, and n-butyl lithium having the concentration of 1.6 mol/L were continuously fed through an inlet (an inner diameter of a mixing portion: 3.6 mm) of the reactor A in a mixing volume ratio of 1:1 so that the residence time becomes 6.6 minutes. After the reaction, a solution containing 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethyl-benzene lithium was continuously taken out through an outlet of the reactor A. On the other hand, a solution prepared by dissolving 6.01 g (100 mmol) of methyl formate in 5 mL of tetrahydrofuran and adjusting the temperature to −8° C. is charged in a reactor B. The above solution containing 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethyl-phenyl lithium at −4° C. was taken out from the reactor A and then immediately added dropwise in the reactor B at a rate of 0.1 mL per 1 minute. This operation was continued for 4 hours. The reaction could be continuously carried out for 4 hours without causing troubles such as clogging in the tubular flow type reactor A. In the reactor B, stirring was carried out for 30 minutes after completion of the dropwise addition to obtain a solution containing 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde. A ratio of conversion into 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde from 3,4-difluoro-benzotrifluoride was 82%. To the solution obtained in the reactor B, 20 mL of ethanol and 2.28 g (32.8 mmol) hydroxylamine hydrochloride were added and the mixture was refluxed for 1.5 hours. After completion of the reflux, the reaction solution was filtered and concentrated to obtain a crude crystal of 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethyl-benz aldoxime as the objective product. This crude crystal was analyzed by HPLC and, as a result, the crude crystal showed a yield of 77% and a purity of 97% based upon the converted raw material. Comparative Example 8 The same operation as in Example 4 was carried out, except that bis[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl]ether was not used. After 1.6 hours have passed since the initiation of the operation, the tubular flow type reactor A caused occlusion and the reaction had to be stopped. Although detailed cause of occlusion is unclear, it is considered that an oligomer or the like was produced because of low stability of 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethyl-benzene lithium. As is apparent from the above results, even when the aromatic compound or halogenated unsaturated aliphatic compound is reacted with the lithiating agent under comparatively mild conditions in the presence of a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or a coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group, the organolithium compound can be obtained in a high yield. It is also found that the substituted aromatic compound can be obtained in a high yield even when the reaction of the organolithium compound obtained in the above method with the electrophilic compound is carried out under comparatively mild conditions. According to a conventional manner, when the reaction of the aromatic compound with the lithiating agent is carried out by a tubular flow type reactor, the reactor causes occlusion and thus the reaction cannot be continued (Comparative Example 8). However, when the reaction of the aromatic compound with the lithiating agent is carried out by a tubular flow type reactor in the presence of a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or a coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group, the reactor is less likely to cause occlusion, and thus the reaction can be efficiently carried out continuously for a long time (Example 4). As described above, a coordinating compound containing three or more elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one thereof being a nitrogen element, or a coordinating compound containing three or more oxygen elements having a coordinating ability in a molecule, at least one of the groups containing the oxygen elements having a coordinating ability being a tertiary alkoxy group, can be used as an occlusion-preventing agent for a piping or the like, a residence time extending agent in a continuous flow type reactor, or a reaction runaway inhibitor or a scaling inhibitor, in the production of the organolithium compound, or the production of the substituted aromatic compound by the reaction of the organolithium compound with the electrophilic compound. Examples 5 to 6 and Comparative Examples 9 to 14 Test Method B Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran (containing 6 g of o-xylene as an internal standard), 35.0 mmol of a coordinating compound shown in Table 2 (a coordinating compound is not used in Comparative Example 9) and 6.06 g (33.3 mmol) of 3,4-difluoro-benzotrifluoride were charged in a reaction vessel equipped with a dropping funnel and a stirrer and then cooled to −50° C. After adding dropwise 15.1 g (35.0 mmol) of n-butyl lithium (1.6 mol/L hexane solution) at −50° C., the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour to obtain a solution containing 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethyl-phenyl lithium. A small amount of a sample was extracted from the solution at −50° C. and was added to a tetrahydrofuran/hexane solution of iodide (excess amount), prepared separately. By the addition to the iodine solution, 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethyl-phenyl lithium (LDFBT) was iodized to obtain a product containing 2-iodo-3,4-difluoro-benzotrifluoride (IDFBT) as a main component. The production amount (%) of IDFBT was quantitatively analyzed by HPLC. Next, this solution was heated to 0° C. and stirred at the same temperature for 4 hours. Thereafter, the residual amount (%) of IDFBT was quantitatively analyzed in the same manner as in above. Furthermore, the solution was left to stand at −15° C. for the time shown in Table 2. Then, the residual amount (%) of IDFBT was quantitatively analyzed in the same manner as in above. From the above analytical results, the residual amount (%) of 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethyl-phenyl lithium (LDFBT) was calculated by the following equation. [in-line-formulae]“Residual amount (%) of LDFBT=“residual amount (%) of IDFBT after a predetermined time has passed since temperature rise”/“production amount (%) of IDFBT at −50° C.]×100[/in-line-formulae] The results are shown in Table 2.

Ex- am- ple 14 94 80 (22 hours) As is apparent form a comparison between Example 5 and Example 14, the lithiated compound can be stably kept not only in an aprotic polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, but also in a non-polar solvent such as hexane. Example 15 Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 3,4-difluoro-benzotrifluoride (DFBT) (6.06 g, 33.3 mmol) and bis[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl]ether (5.87 g, 36.6 mmol) were dissolved in 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran in a 100 mL round-bottom flask (reactor A) made of glass equipped with a stirrer tip and a thermometer. After cooling to 10° C., n-butyl lithium (1.6 mol/L hexane solution) (21.9 mL, 14.5 g, 35.0 mmol) was added dropwise over 34 minutes while maintaining at 8 to 10° C., followed by stirring for 60 minutes. On the other hand, a solution prepared by dissolving iodine (16.8 g, 66.2 mmol) and o-xylene (internal standard, 6.01 g) in tetrahydrofuran (60 mL, 53.2 g) and adjusting a temperature to −15° C. is charged in a reactor B. The entire amount of the solution containing 2,3-difluoro-6-trifluoromethyl-phenyl lithium (LDFBT) at 10° C. was taken out from the reactor A and then immediately added dropwise over 50 minutes while maintaining the inner temperature of the reactor B at −13 to −17° C., followed by further stirring in the same temperature range for 10 minutes. This reaction solution was quantitatively analyzed by HPLC and, as a result, the objective 2-iodo-3,4-difluoro-benzotrifluoride (IDFBT) showed a yield of 74%. 1H-NMR (CDC3) 7.27 ppm (q, J=8.3 Hz, 1H), 7.48 (ddd, J=8.9, 4.8, 1.7 Hz, 1H) Boiling point: 49-55° C./7 mmHg Comparative Example 16 In the same manner as in Example 15, except that bis[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl] ether was not added, a reaction was carried out. After the reaction, quantitative analysis was carried out by HPLC and, as a result, the objective 2-iodo-3,4-difluoro-benzotrifluoride (IDFBT) showed a yield of 1.4%. Example 16 Production of 1-[2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy]-N,N,2-trimethylpropane-2-amine To toluene (100 ml), sodium hydroxide (16.7 g, 418 mmol) and 2-dimethylamino-2-methyl-1-propanol (23.4 g, 200 mmol) were added and the mixture was heated at reflux for 2 hours. After cooling to 70° C., β-dimethylaminoethyl chloride hydrochloride (28.8 g, 200 mmol) was added. Then, the mixture was heated at reflux for 5.5 hours. After cooling to room temperature, insolubles were separated by filtration and the organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was distilled under reduced pressure to obtain 10.3 g (in a yield of 27%) of the objective compound as a colorless liquid. 1H-NMR (CDC3) 1.03 ppm (s, 6H), 2.27 (s, 12H), 2.53 (t, J=6.0 Hz, 2H), 3.29 (s, 2H), 3.54 (t, J=6.0 Hz, 2H) Boiling point: 75-77° C./6 mmHg Example 17 Production of 1,1′-oxybis(N,N,2-trimethylpropane-2-amine) To tetrahydrofuran (100 mL), oily sodium hydride (purity of 60% by weight, 6.6 g, 99 mmol) was added and then 2-dimethylamino-2-methyl-1-propanol (11.7 g, 99.8 mmol) was added dropwise at 0° C. After heating to reflux, the mixture was stirred for 3 hours. A tetrahydrofuran (25 mL) solution of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (9.53 g, 50 mmol) was added dropwise at a reflux temperature. Then, potassium iodide (3.75 g, 22.6 mmol) and toluene (100 mL) were added and the mixture was refluxed overnight. After being left standing to cool to room temperature, water was added and the solution was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with water, dried over an anhydrous magnesium sulfate powder and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was distilled under reduced pressure to obtain 4.69 g (43%) of the objective compound as a colorless liquid. 1H-NMR (CDC3) 1.06 ppm (s, 12H), 2.29 (s, 12H), 3.27 (s, 4H) Boiling point: 85-88° C./7 mmHg Example 18 Production of 2-(2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy)-N,N-dimethylcyclohexaneamine To tetrahydrofuran (100 mL), oily sodium hydride (purity 60% by weight, 18 g, 450 mmol) was added and 2-(dimethylamino)ethanol (16.1 g, 180 mmol) was added dropwise at 0° C., and then the mixture was refluxed for 3 hours. To this suspension, toluene (80 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (25 mL) were added. A toluene (200 mL)/tetrahydrofuran (25 mL) mixed solution of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (37.2 g, 195 mmol) was added dropwise at 0 to 5° C., followed by stirring at the same temperature for 1 hour. After further stirring for 1 hour under heating at reflux, the mixture was left standing to cool to room temperature. After adding dropwise 2-(dimethylamino)cyclohexanol (21.5 g, 150 mmol) at room temperature, potassium iodide (29.9 g, 180 mmol) was added. After stirring for 9 hours under heating at reflux, the reaction solution was left standing to cool to room temperature. Water was added and the solution was extracted with ethyl acetate, and then the organic phase was washed with water and saturated saline. This organic phase was dried over an anhydrous magnesium sulfate powder and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was distilled under reduced pressure to obtain 2.3 g (in a yield of 7%) of the objective compound as a yellow liquid. 1H-NMR (CDC3) 1.11-1.26 ppm (m, 4H), 1.67-1.78 (m, 3H), 2.09-2.12 (m, 1H), 2.26 (s, 6H), 2.36 (s, 6H), 2.39-2.42 (m, 1H), 2.51 (td, J=6.4, 1.3 Hz, 2H), 3.25 (td, J=9.4, 4.1 Hz, 1H), 3.53 (dt, J=9.5, 6.4 Hz, 1H), 3.68 (dt, J=9.5, 6.4 Hz, 1H) Boiling point: 91-93° C./5 mmHg INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY According to the method for producing an organolithium compound of the present invention, it is possible to considerably improve the stability of an organolithium compound produced through metalization by lithium. This method enables the production of an organolithium compound in a high yield under comparatively mild conditions by considerably decreasing the operational burden and the burden of safety measures. Also, according to the method for producing a substituted aromatic compound of the present invention, it is possible to obtain a substituted aromatic compound in a high yield under comparatively mild conditions by considerably decreasing the operational burden and the burden of safety measures. That is, in a tubular flow type reactor such as a microreactor and a cascade method, defects such as occlusion of transfer tubes among a tube, a reactor and a batch are less likely to arise in the continuous reaction under comparatively mild conditions. In the case of a batch type reaction, the generation of scaling of the reactor can be prevented and thus the reaction can be easily controlled. In case very large stabilization effect of an organolithium compound is exerted, continuation per se can be avoided. Furthermore, according to the production method of the present invention, since a special facility is not required for cooling, production costs can be considerably suppressed. In a tubular flow type reactor, since the diameter of the tube can be increased, production costs can be considerably suppressed. 1.
