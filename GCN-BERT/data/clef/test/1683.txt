DISPOSABLE HOSPITAL GOWN FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates to gowns, and more particularly to a disposable hospital gown. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Disposable hospital gowns are well known. They are worn by doctors, nurses, other healthcare providers, hospital workers and visitors in hospitals and healthcare facilities in the course of treating or handling patients with serious contagious diseases, infections, potential infections or compromised immune systems. One of the concerns with disposable hospital gowns is that the removal of a gown from a person will spread germs, bacteria and other infections that might affect the person wearing the gown or other people in and around the gown and carried to later infect others the individuals come in contact with. Generally, no matter how much care is exercised in the conventional handling of a disposable hospital gown, there is a chance that contamination found on the exterior of the gown will spread. [0003] There has been and continues to be a need for a disposable hospital gown that can be discarded and disposed of in such a fashion that substantial risk of spreading contamination, infections, etc. is avoided. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0004] The present invention is a disposable hospital gown that includes an integral one or two part disposable wrapper. Once the gown has been used or exposed to infection or contamination, the hospital gown is rolled or folded into a bundle and wrapped in the integral disposable wrapper, [0005] The present invention also entails a method of disposing of a disposable hospital gown by folding or rolling the hospital gown into a bundle and reversing an integral disposable wrapper that forms a part of the gown and wherein in the process of reversing the disposable wrapper, the bundled gown is placed or stuffed in the reversed disposable wrapper. [0006] The present invention also entails a disposable hospital gown that includes donned gloves or gloves that are integral with sleeves of the gown or tethered to the gown. This enables the gloves to be removed from the hands as the gown is being removed from a person such that the gloves can be contained within the bundle and placed inside the disposable wrapper. In addition, the disposable gown includes folding seams or lines formed vertically across the front of the gown. These folding seams or lines facilitate the folding and bundling of the gown for disposal. [0007] Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent and obvious from a study of the following description and the accompanying drawings which are merely illustrative of such invention.

[0035] Figure 7 A shows one embodiment of the hospital gown where a disposable glove is tethered to the end of the sleeve of the gown. [0036] Figure 7Β shows another embodiment where the disposable glove is integrally formed or attached to the end of the sleeve. DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT [0037] With further reference to the drawings, a disposable hospital gown is shown therein and indicated generally by the numeral 10. Hospital gown 10 can be constructed of various materials such as conventional materials that are typically used in the construction of hospital gowns, especially disposable isolation hospital gowns, disposable surgical gowns, or disposable patient gowns that are exposed to contamination. Hospital gown 10 includes a main body indicated generally by the numeral 12 and a pair of long sleeves 14 that project from the upper portion of the main body. Main body 12 includes two basic areas, a front area 12Α and a back area 12Β. Front area 12Α is particularly shown in Figure 1 and the back area is shown in Figure 2. Back area 12Β is split and includes terminal edges 18. This is illustrated in Figure 2 and enables the gown 10 to be easily placed on and taken off a person. It is appreciated that the main body 12 includes an outer surface and an inner surface. In Figure 1, the outer surface of front area 12a is shown. In Figure 2, the outer surface of the back 12Β is shown. Also in Figure 2, the inner surface of the front area 12Α is shown. [0038] Continuing to refer to the gown 10, there is provided a neck opening 16 that extends around an upper portion of the main body 12. Further, adjacent the edges 18 of the back area 12Β, there is provided one or more fasteners for securing the back area portions together when the gown 10 is worn by a person. [0039] Gown 10 includes an integral disposable wrapper indicated generally by the numeral 30. Disposable wrapper 30 is secured to and forms a part of the gown 10. Note in the preferred embodiment the particular location of the disposable wrapper 30. it is placed about the lower portion of the front area 12Α. As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, the disposable wrapper 30 is generally centrally located with respect to the side edges of the front area 12Α. That is, the disposable wrapper 30 is generally aligned with the neck opening 16. Also as seen in Figures 1 and 2, the disposable wrapper is disposed on the inside of the front area 12Α. [0040] Disposable wrapper 30 is pliable, non-permeable, and in one embodiment is comprised at least in part of plastic material. Disposable wrapper 30 can be secured or integrated into the gown 10 in various ways. For example, the disposable wrapper 30 can be glued or stitched into the gown 10. In one embodiment, a portion of the front area 12Α can also serve as a side or surface of the disposable wrapper 30. [0041] Secured to the side or panel 30Α of wrapper 30 is a tab 30C. Tab 30C can be utilized to maintain the disposable wrapper 30 closed while the gown 10 is worn. In addition, and as discussed hereafter, tab 30C is utilized to close the disposable wrapper when the gown 10 has been wrapped therein. [0042] Figures 3A-3I illustrate how the disposable hospital gown 10 is rolled or folded into a bundle and disposed of by wrapping the bundled gown in the disposable wrapper 30 that forms an integral part of the gown. Starting with Figure 3Α, the lefthand sleeve 14 is turned inside-outward to form the inside-outward left sleeve 14 shown in Figure 3Α, This is typically accomplished by the person wearing the gown simply grasping an inside surface of the sleeve and pulling the arm out of the sleeve. Once the left-hand sleeve 14 has been turned inside-outward, a left portion of the back area 12Β can be positioned across the front area 12Α as shown in Figure 3Β. Note that the back area 12Β that is folded over the front area 12Α generally underlies the inside-outward sleeve 14. In order to narrow the width of the gown, a portion of the back area 12Β is lapped over another portion and this gives rise to seam or fold 12C shown in Figure 3Β. As seen in Figure 3Β, it is important to appreciate that the portion of the back area 12Β shown therein and exposed is the inner surface of the back area. Thus, the person removing the gown and folding or rolling the gown into a bundle can contact the inner surface of the inside-outward sleeve 14 or the inner surface of the back area 12Β. This enables the person to avoid touching the outer surface of the main body 12 or even the outer surface of a sleeve 14. The wrapper is wide enough that it can encompass any reasonable size rolled gown. [0043] The method or process described above and shown in Figures 3Α and 3Β with respect to the left side of the gown 10 is repeated for the right side of the gown. This is illustrated in Figure 3C, As Figure 3C illustrates, both sleeves 14 have been turned inside-outward and the back area 12Β from both sides has been positioned over a portion of the front area 12Α. As seen in Figure 3C, the complete area of the outer surface of 12Α has been covered by the back area 12Β of the gown. Furthermore, the exposed portion of the back area 12Β is the inner surface of the back area and not the outer surface thereof. [0044] After the gown 10 has been placed in the general configuration shown in Figure 3C, the gown is folded or rolled downwardly from the top. This is illustrated in Figure 3D. Note in Figure 3D where a portion of the front area 12Α is rolled or folded downwardly over a portion of the inside-outward sleeves 14. The upper portion of the front area 12Α exposed in Figure 3D is the inner surface of the front area. [0045] The folding or rolling of the gown is continued as shown in Figure 3Ε. Again, the upper portion of the gown as viewed in Figure 3Ε comprises a portion of a front area 12a, but again the upper exposed surface of the front area is the inner surface thereof. [0046] The process continues as illustrated in Figure 3F. Note that in Figure 3F, the closing tab 30C formed on the inner surface of the front area 12Α is shown. [0047] Eventually, the gown is folded or rolled to a point where a bundle is formed. The bundled gown is shown in Figure 3G. In this orientation, the bundled gown 10 overlies the disposable wrapper 30. In order to place the bundled gown into the disposable wrapper 30, the disposable wrapper is turned inside-outward and in the process wraps around the bundled gown as illustrated in Figure 3Η. In this process, the former inner surface 30Β of the disposable wrapper 30 becomes the outer surface of the formed pouch or container. That is, by turning the disposable wrapper 30 inside-outward, the wrapper wraps around while the bundled gown is stuffed, pushed or placed into the interior area of the formed pouch. Therefore, the former exterior or outer surface 30Α of the disposable wrapper 30 becomes the interior surface of the pouch shown in Figures 3Η and 3I. The former inner surface 30Β of the disposable wrapper 30 now becomes the outer surface or exterior surface of the pouch. Finally, the closing tab 30C, which can be a piece of tape, an adhesive strip or other closing device, is closed down on the exterior surface 30Β of the pouch and this containerizes by wrapping the bundled gown. [0048] This wrapper forms an additional line of defense, as it creates a barrier helping to guard against the transmission of possible infectious agents, such as but not limited to, staphylococcus aureus and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) etc., which can be spread on contact. [0049] To facilitate the folding or rolling of the gown into the bundle, the outer surface of the main body 12 and sleeves 14 could be a different color from the inner surface of the main body and sleeves. In addition, the gown 10 can be provided with indicia that facilitates and makes the folding or rolling of the gown into a bundle easier. That is, indicia or lines can be drawn or provided on the gown to indicate the appropriate position of portions of the gown during various stages of the rolling or folding process. [0050] In the embodiment illustrated, there is one tab 30C for closing the formed pouch or container. It is understood and appreciated that there can be a plurality of tabs and, indeed, there can be provided a closing device formed in the disposable wrapper or formed in conjunction with the gown that will provide a generally airtight seal when the pouch is closed. [0051] In most cases, persons wearing the gown 10 will also have gloves. These gloves can be removed prior to removing and folding the gown 10 into the bundle. In the alternative, the gloves can be removed during the process of removing the sleeves 14. It should also be noted that waist ties that might be used with the gown should be of a length such that they cannot hang below the gown. It should also be noted that any process of removing the disposable gown that folds or rolls the gown into the wrapper and adheres to hospital protocol (where the wearer does not have contact with the contaminated portion) is acceptable. [0052] It is appreciated by those skilled in the art that the gown 10 can assume various designs and styles. However, the use of the integral disposable wrapper 30 and the general method or process of disposing of the gown will remain the same. The basic method or process of forming the disposable hospital gown into a bundle and containerizing the disposable gown in a disposable wrapper will remain the same. Alternative Design for the Disposable Hospital Gown [0053] With reference to Figures 4-7Β, an alternative design is shown therein for the disposable hospital gown. Basically, the alternative design is similar in many respects to the design discussed above and shown in Figures 4-7Β. [0054] With reference to Figure 4, the alternative design shown therein is provided with two parallel fold lines 70 formed about the front portion 12Α of the gown. The fold lines 70 can be constructed or formed in various ways. In one embodiment the fold lines actually comprise a pair of seams sewn or formed into the hospital gown. In other embodiments the fold lines 70 may include press lines or folding seams that are formed during manufacture or even formed when the gown is folded for packaging purposes. In any event the purpose of the fold lines 70 is to facilitate and make easier the folding of the gown 10 for the purpose of compacting the gown such that it can be placed in the wrapper 30. The fold lines 70 also enable the gown 10 to be neatly folded and compactly rolled or otherwise transformed into a relatively small configuration. Although some examples of forming or creating the fold lines 70 are given, it is appreciated by those skilled in the art that there are other means for forming the fold lines. [0055] The alternative design for the hospital gown also envisions the use of a light adhesive in order to secure the back edges of the gown together. A light adhesive can be sprayed or applied to selected areas along the rear edges of the gown back such that the rear edges can be overlapped at selected areas and easily secured together because of the presence of the light adhesive. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5, one edge of the rear portion of the gown 10 is provided with a series of tabs 20. These tabs can be sprayed on one side with a light adhesive that is effective to secure the tabs to the other back edge of the gown. In addition, the gown along these back edges could be simply sprayed in spots or streaks with such a light adhesive such that the back edges can be easily secured together to close the gown 10 about the back when being worn. As discussed before, there are various means for attaching the edges of the back together. [0056] Further, the alternative design as shown in Figure 4 includes a wrapper 30 that has a different shape. As shown in Figure 4, the side edges of the wrapper 30 taper generally inwardly and downwardly from the top of the wrapper. The wrapper 30 as oriented assumes a generally inverted trapezoidal shape. The inwardly and downwardly tapering sides or side edges of the wrapper 30 are designed to facilitate folding and disposing of the gown 10. To some extent at least, with the side edges being tapered downwardly and inwardly, the side edges of the wrapper 30 do not actually interfere or otherwise make the folding of the gown more difficult. It is appreciated that the wrapper 30 can assume various configurations and that the configurations disclosed herein are examples. [0057] Another feature of the alternative design is that the gown 10 is designed to be worn and used in conjunction with disposable gloves. The alternative design envisions that gloves will be worn by healthcare professionals while the gown is being worn. The alternative design envisions in one embodiment a pair of gloves 80 being integral with the sleeves 14 of the gown or being tethered to the gown. In Figure 7Α, the gloves 80 are tethered to the gown while in the design shown in Figure 7Β the gloves 80 are integrally constructed with the sleeve 14 of the gown. [0058] Figures 6Β-6Μ describe and show how the disposable hospital gown is rolled or bundled and held within the wrapper 30. In Figure 6Β, the right gloved hand RGH grabs the end of the left hand sleeve at the wrist, and at the same time grabs the wrist portion of the left hand glove LG. [0059] With reference to Figure 6C, the right gloved hand RGH holds the left sleeve and the left hand glove LG and the left hand is pulled from the left hand glove. This effectively turns the left hand glove inside out and the left hand glove remains inside the left hand sleeve. This leaves the left hand (ungloved) within the left hand sleeve. [0060] Figure 6D shows that the left hand LH, while within the left sleeve, is used to reach over and grab the right hand glove RG at the wrist, and at the same time grab the right sleeve at the wrist. Then while the left hand LH holds the right sleeve and the right glove RG, the right hand RH is pulled from the right glove and in the process the right hand is free and the right glove is turned inside outwards and remains in the right sleeve. Viewing Figure 6Ε, it is seen that both hands lie inside the respective sleeves. Both gloves have been removed and lie inside the sleeves. It should be noted that both gloves at this time are inside out. Still, at this point, the left hand LH is still holding onto the right sleeve, the right glove RG, and the left glove LG. [0061] In Figure 6F, the free right hand RH is moved to where the right hand engages a right back portion of the gown, and with the right hand, this right back portion of the gown is folded over the front right portion of the gown. In an embodiment where the front portion includes seam 70, the right back portion of the gown is folded along one seam. [0062] As illustrated in Figure 6G, the right hand RH then grabs the bundled gloves and sleeves that the left hand LH has been holding. [0063] Now, as illustrated in Figure 6Η, the left hand LH releases from the left sleeve and engages the left back portion of the gown, and folds the left back portion of the gown over a left front portion of the gown. Again, this is illustrated in Figure 6Η. [0064] Turning to Figure 6I, the person wearing the gown then begins to fold or roll the gown downwardly from the top. The hands can be within the bundle or outside of the bundle. [0065] Figure 6J shows the gown continuing to be rolled downwardly towards the position of the wrapper 30. Eventually, the gown is rolled or folded downwardly to a position adjacent the wrapper 30. See Figure 6Κ. The wrapper 30 is turned inside out and the bundle or folded gown is placed or stuffed inside the wrapper 30. As discussed before, at this juncture in the method or process, the wrapper 30 is turned inside out and the gown is placed inside the wrapper as it is turned inside out. See Figure 6L. [0066] Finally, as illustrated in Figure 6Μ, the closing tab 30C is fastened to the wrapper 30 and the disposable hospital gown is safely secured therein. [0067] There are numerous options or alternative ways to roll and package the disposable gown. For example, reference is made again to Figure 6Ε. At this point, the free hands can remain inside the sleeves and the person wearing the gown can begin to roll the gown while the free hands are still within the sleeve. The gown is continued to be rolled to a selected point where the hands are then removed and then the hands are used to further roll, fold, or manipulate the gown sufficient for the gown to be inserted inside the inside out wrapper 30. [0068] The present invention may, of course, be carried out in other specific ways than those herein set forth. The present embodiments are therefore to be construed in all aspects as illustrative of preferred embodiments.
