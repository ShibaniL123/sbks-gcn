Intermediate 45: 7-Chloro-8-iodo-2-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
To a microwave vial charged with EtOH (2.0 mL) were added 4-chloro-3-iodopyridin-2-amine (150 mg, 0.59 mmol) and 3-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-one (122 μL, 1.18 mmol). The vial was capped and the reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h, followed by heating at 100° C. in the microwave for 1 h. After cooling to rt, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was diluted with sat. aq. NaHCO3 and extracted with EtOAc (×3). The combined organic extracts were concentrated. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-30% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as an off-white solid (190 mg, 93% yield).
