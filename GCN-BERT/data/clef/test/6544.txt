Step 1. Synthesis of 1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate
1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylic anhydride (11.9 g, 0.06 mol) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (4.18 g, 0.06 mol) were combined as a solution in pyridine (70 mL). The reaction was conducted under reflux for 1 h followed by cooling to 80Â° C. To the reaction system mixture was added powdered p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (22.88 g, 0.12 mol). After the addition, the reaction was performed under reflux for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into ice water (200 mL) and stirred to precipitate crystals. The precipitate was filtered and rinsed with additional cool water (100 mL) and saturated NaHCO3 (100 mL) to give 1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl 4-methyl benzenesulfonate (17 g, 78%) as a yellow solid.
