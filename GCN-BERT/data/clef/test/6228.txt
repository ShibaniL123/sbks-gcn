DESCRIPTION TITLE OF INVENTION: HERBICIDAL COMPOSITION TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a herbicidal composition and a method for controlling undesired plants. BACKGROUND ART Patent Document 1 discloses a herbicidal composition comprising at least one acetolactate synthase inhibitor, at least one 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenaseinhibitor and at least one saturated or unsaturated fatty acid. Patent Document 2 discloses a composition comprising at least one sulfonylurea herbicide, diuron and hexazinone. However, Patent Documents 1 and 2 failed to specifically disclose a remarkable synergistic effect by combination of flazasulfuron or its salt and at least one herbicidal compound selected from the group consisting of imazapic, hexazinone, mesotrione and their salts. PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS PATENT DOCUMENTS Patent Document 1: W02008/142391 Patent Document 2: W02009/054823 DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION TECHNICAL PROBLEM At present, many herbicidal compositions have been developed and used, but they are not necessarily sufficient to control undesired plants such as weeds to be controlled in some cases, and a herbicidal composition having high activity has been desired. SOLUTION TO PROBLEM The present inventors have conducted extensive studies and as a result, found that a herbicidal composition having high activity can be obtained by combination of specific compounds, and accomplished the present invention. That is, the present invention provides the following (1) to (4). (1) A herbicidal composition comprising as active ingredients (A) flazasulfuron or its salt (hereinafter referred to as compound A) and (Β) at least one herbicidal compound selected from the group consisting of imazapic, hexazinone, mesotrione and their salts (hereinafter referred to as compound Β). (2) The composition according to (1), wherein the mixing ratio of compound A to compound Β is from 1:0.2 to 1:50 by the weight ratio. (3) A method for controlling undesired plants or inhibiting their growth, which comprises applying a herbicidally effective amount of compound A and a herbicidally effective amount of compound Β to the undesired plants or to a place where they grow. (4) The method according to (3), wherein compound A is applied in an amount of from 10 to 100 g/ha, and compound Β is applied in an amount of from 20 to 500 g/ha. ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION According to the present invention, a herbicidal composition having high activity can be obtained. When the herbicidal activity in a case where two active ingredients are combined, is larger than the simple sum of the respective herbicidal activities of the two active ingredients (the expected activity), it is called a synergistic effect. The activity expected by the combination of two active ingredients can be calculated as follows (Colby S.R., “Weed”, vol. 15, ρ. 20-22, 1967). Ε = ( + )-( )/100 where : growth inhibition rate when treated with χ (g/ha) of herbicide X, : growth inhibition rate when treated with y (g/ha) of herbicide Υ, Ε: growth inhibition rate expected when treated with χ (g/ha) of herbicide X and y (g/ha) of herbicide Υ. That is, when the actual growth inhibition rate (measured value) is larger than the growth inhibition rate by the above calculation (calculated value), the activity by the combination can be regarded as showing a synergistic effect. The herbicidal composition of the present invention shows a synergistic effect when calculated by the above formula. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Compound A and compound Β sometimes form salts or have isomers, and they are included in the present invention so long as they are agriculturally acceptable. The mixing ratio of compound A to compound Β cannot generally be defined, as it varies depending upon various conditions such as the type of the formulation, the weather conditions, and the type and the growth stage of the undesired plants, and is, for example, from 1:0.2 to 1:50, preferably from 1:0.8 to 1:40, further preferably from 1:1 to 1:30 by the weight ratio. The herbicidally effective amounts of compounds A and Β cannot generally be defined, as they vary depending upon various conditions such as the mixing ratio of compound A to Β, the type of the formulation, the weather conditions, and the type and the growth stage of the undesired plants. However, for example, compound A is applied in an amount of from 10 to 100 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 50 g/ha, and compound Β is applied in an amount of from 20 to 500 g/ha, preferably from 40 to 400 g/ha, further preferably from 50 to 300 g/ha. The herbicidal composition of the present invention may be applied to undesired plants or may be applied to a place where they grow. Further, it may be applied at any time either before or after the emergence of the undesired plants. Further, the herbicidal composition of the present invention may take various application forms such as soil application, foliar application, irrigation application, and submerged application, and it can be applied to agricultural fields such as upland fields, orchards and paddy fields, and non-cropland such as ridges of fields, fallow fields, play grounds, golf courses, vacant lands, forests, factory sites, railway sides and roadsides.
