To a 500 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with condenser and argon inlet were added aluminum chloride (7.10 g, 53.24 mmol), carbon disulfide (60 mL), and chloroacetyl chloride (2.06 g, 18.25 mmol) under ice-bath. The mixture was stirred for 15 mins. To the stirring mixture was added benzanilide (3.00 g, 15.21 mmol) in portions over 5 mins. The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes prior to reflux for 2.5 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled and the solvent was decanted off. Then ice and cold water (100 mL) was slowly added while stirred thoroughly. The beige precipitate filtered and washed with water (3Ã—100 mL). The residue was purified by precipitating in diethyl ether and filtration to N-(4-(2-chloroacetyl)phenyl)benzamide (3.75 g, 90%) as a grey solid.
