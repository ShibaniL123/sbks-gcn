Step 3: 2-methyl-N-(1-(3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)ethyl)propane-2-sulfinamide
The raw material 2-methyl-N-(1-(3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)ethylidene)propane-2-sulfinamide (300 mg, 0.86 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (100 mL), and cooled to a temperature of 0 Â°C. Sodium borohydride (65 mg, 1.71 mmol) was added to the reactant in portions, and then the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 2 hours. Saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride was added to quench the reaction, and the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 2-methyl-N-(1-(3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)ethyl)propane-2-sulfinamide (200 mg, yield 66.3%).
