TECHNICAL FIELD This specification pertains to the release of hydrogen from an alkali metal-transition metal borohydride (e.g., NaxZny (BH4)x+2y) while minimizing the concomitant release of diborane (B2H6). More specifically, this disclosure pertains to careful mixing of a metal hydride compound with the alkali metal-transition metal borohydride and heating the mixture to release hydrogen and capture the boron as a solid boride compound. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Metal borohydrides containing BH4− complexes are attractive candidates for compact hydrogen storage because of their large hydrogen content relative to their weight and volume. Simple alkali metal or alkaline earth metal borohydrides such as LiBH4 (18.5 wt % hydrogen), NaBH4 (10.7 wt % hydrogen), Mg(BH4)2 (14.9 wt % hydrogen), and Ca(BH4)2 (11.6 wt % hydrogen) are too stable, requiring high temperatures (300-500° C.) to release hydrogen, and even partial re-absorption of hydrogen requires high H2 pressures. Moreover, intermediate phases such as Li2B12H12 can form during decomposition at high temperature, and once formed these phases strongly inhibit reversibility. Transition metal borohydrides and mixed alkali metal-transition metal borohydrides are less stable, and therefore could be suitable candidates for hydrogen storage. Transition metal borohydrides include the borohydrides of chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, niobium, scandium, titanium, vanadium, yttrium, zinc, and zirconium. Mixed borohydride compounds of one of such transition metals and an alkali metal such as lithium, sodium, or potassium may also be formed. Unfortunately, in many cases the borohydride decomposes through the emission of diborane gas (B2H6) in addition to yielding hydrogen gas. Such emission is clearly deleterious; first, most of the available hydrogen is tied up as diborane rather than being released as H2, second, diborane evolution permanently removes boron from the material, and third, diborane may present environmental issues. There is a need for a method of recovering hydrogen from transition metal borohydrides and mixed alkali metal-containing and transition metal-containing borohydrides while reducing or eliminating the evolution of diborane gas. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One example of a mixed alkali metal-transition metal borohydride, that tends to release diborane gas with hydrogen, is the Na—Zn-borohydride system. This mixed borohydride can be formed from ZnCl2 and NaBH4 by an ion exchange reaction: [in-line-formulae]ZnCl2+dNaBH4→aNaCl+bNa2ZnCl4+cNaxZny(BH4)x+2y (1)[/in-line-formulae] where a, b, c, d, x, and y are chosen to balance the reaction, e.g., (x+2y)=(d/c). Two Na—Zn-borohydride compounds have been identified to date, namely NaZn(BH4)3 (x=1, y=1) and NaZn2(BH4)5 (x=1, y=2). For the purpose of demonstrating this invention, samples were synthesized using d=2. The ion exchange reaction may be conducted, for example, by mixing the solid alkali metal and transition metal precursors in a suitable ball mill. High energy ball milling with a SPEX 8000 Mixer/Mill is a typical method for producing the sodium zinc borohydride on the right from the starting mixture on the left in equation (1). Once formed, NaxZny(BH4)x+2y is slightly unstable at room temperature and will slowly decompose over a period of days. For this reason, in the following work, a fresh sample was milled for each experiment. When heated, the ball milled mixture containing NaxZny(BH4)x+2y decomposes at low temperature (onset ˜60° C.) according to the reaction: [in-line-formulae]aNaCl+bNa2ZnCl4+cNaxZny(BH4)d/c→Zn+2NaCl+(d−2)Na+(d/2)B2H6+(d/2)H2 (2)[/in-line-formulae] While the sodium chloride and sodium zinc chloride are diluents in the mixture, the sodium zinc borohydride produces both H2 and B2H6 in approximately equal molar quantities. While hydrogen is released in good quantity, it is necessary, as described above, to minimize the release of diborane (B2H6). Hence, this sodium zinc borohydride-containing mixture was selected as a suitable test system for embodiments of this invention because of its known proclivity for generating substantial amounts of diborane. This invention provides a means to reduce, and potentially completely eliminate, the diborane gas produced from transition metal borohydrides and mixed alkali metal-transition metal borohydrides. In practices of the invention another compound is used in combination with the borohydride to minimize release of diborane. Preferably the added compound is another hydride that forms a boride. In this way the boron in the borohydride can be captured by the product boride phase rather than forming diborane and escaping from the material. For purposes of illustration, the examples given here use Na—Zn-borohydride, synthesized according to (1) with d=2, as a diborane-producing model system. And MgH2 is added to the system to provide the boride-forming compound, with the formation of MgB2 as the product phase. In this illustrative diborane-eliminating system, a hypothetical decomposition reaction might be: [in-line-formulae]aNaCl+bNa2ZnCl4+cNaxZny(BH4)d/c+(d/2)MgH2→Zn+2NaCl+(d−2)Na+(d/2)MgB2+(5d/2)H2 (3)[/in-line-formulae] The MgH2 also provides additional hydrogen to partially offset the added weight of the Mg. The theoretical hydrogen release from this reaction is 4.23 wt %, including the extra weight of the chlorides. The hydrogen release from the active portion of the sample, excluding the diluents, NaCl and Na2ZnCl4, is 8.30 wt %. In practices of this embodiment of the invention, it is necessary to intimately mix the MgH2 with the other components without having the MgH2 react with the other components prior to formation of the mixed borohydride. Reaction during synthesis could be reduced by careful non-energetic hand mixing of MgH2 with a previously milled mixture of ZnCl2 and NaBH4. The preferred method in this invention, however, is to directly combine ZnCl2, NaBH4, and MgH2 by milling in a cooled vessel such that the material during milling is kept below the minimum temperature required to induce reaction between the borohydride and the MgH2 (<50° C., see FIG. 3). For the example given here, the milling vessel is continuously cooled by flowing liquid nitrogen (called cryomilling). Thus, mixed transition metal-alkali metal borohydrides may be utilized for hydrogen storage and release with minimal or no accompanying release of diborane gas. In accordance with embodiments of the invention, this result may be accomplished by mixing a suitable metal hydride with the mixed borohydride to capture the boron as a solid boride. In accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, the metal hydride is of relatively low molecular weight (and relatively high hydrogen content) and it possesses suitable reactivity for capturing the boron in a solid compound from the mixed transition metal-alkali metal borohydride in a solid compound. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the transition metal borohydride or the materials forming the transition metal-alkali metal borohydride and the metal hydride are each selected so as to yield an abundance of hydrogen from a relatively small weight and volume of the mixed materials. Accordingly, practices are illustrated and disclosed herein, permitting the use of suitable transition metal borohydrides and mixed transition metal-alkali metal borohydrides as a volume or mass of hydrogen-containing particles for the release of hydrogen on demand for use in a hydrogen-consuming or hydrogen-using device or application. The hydrogen-containing particles are stored at a suitable temperature and in a suitable container, the temperature and chemical environment being managed to minimize unwanted premature hydrogen release. Upon demand, or need, hydrogen is released from the borohydride containing particles by heating the mixture at a suitable rate to a suitable temperature for decomposition of the borohydride(s). The heating may be continued, or stopped and later continued, until hydrogen is depleted from a suitable mass or volume of the borohydride containing particles. Alternatively, the hydrogen-containing particles may be maintained at a suitable fixed temperature under a suitable pressure of hydrogen gas. The fixed temperature and hydrogen pressure are selected for the specific combination of mixed transition metal-alkali metal borohydride and solid boride-forming, metal hydride. Hydrogen can be released on demand by reducing the hydrogen pressure, for example, by withdrawing some of the hydrogen gas to supply a desired hydrogen-using application, such that the particles partially decompose until hydrogen pressure is restored. In order to suppress unwanted release of diborane from the borohydride particles, the particles are intimately mixed with particles of a suitable metal hydride in an amount for capture of the boron content of the borohydride material as it is otherwise being decomposed to release hydrogen gas. Borohydride compounds that release diborane during decomposition cannot be simply restored to their original state by exposure to hydrogen gas. Expensive and difficult chemical regeneration would be required to replace the boron constituent lost during decomposition. By including an additional boron-binding material to retain the boron, it is comprehended that combinations of alkali metals and transition metals in borohydride form having suitable thermodynamic stability will thereby be able to be reversed under hydrogenation conditions to reconstruct the original composition. It is noted, however, that the Na—Zn-borohydride system selected for this demonstration (because of its known diborane-producing decomposition) is itself unstable under ambient conditions of temperature and pressure, and will spontaneously decompose within a few days. As such, this particular combination of alkali metal and transition metal is not expected to show reversibility even in the presence of a diborane mitigator. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the further illustrations which follow.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Examples To establish the behavior of a mixed borohydride system, a mixture of ZnCl2+2 NaBH4 (reflecting molar proportions) was ball milled for 30 min in a SPEX 8000 Mixer/Mill. The resulting mixture was than analyzed and tested as follows. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the resulting milled powder showed the milled sample to be a combination of NaCl, Na2ZnCl4, and NaZn2(BH4)5. Thermal decomposition of a portion of the ball milled mixture was obtained and measured gravimetrically in a Hiden Intelligent Gravimetric Analyzer (IGA) while heating the sample from room temperature to 300° C. at 4.2° C./s in flowing He gas, with a mass spectrometer (MS) sampling the exhaust gas. As shown in FIG. 1, weight loss and gas evolution were detectable starting at about 60° C., and were complete at about 140° C. The total observed weight loss of 12.4 wt % is consistent with the expected reaction producing both hydrogen and diborane in accordance with the assumed reaction (2) as presented above: This assumed reaction predicts a weight loss of 14.0 wt %, of which 13.05 wt % is diborane and 0.95 wt % is H2. The H2 (2 atomic mass units, amu) and B2H6 (26 amu) MS signatures are also shown. In this example, the mass spectrometer was not calibrated, so quantitative results could not be reliably extracted from these data; however the relative B2H6/H2 ratio can be reasonably compared from sample to sample. In this case, the B2H6/H2 ratio is calculated from the areas under the emission peaks to be 0.69 (compared to 1.00 predicted by the diborane producing reaction. The ratio takes into account that the MS cracking fraction for H2 in mass channel 2 amu is 0.952, while the cracking fraction of B2H6 in mass channel 26 amu is 0.216. The difference from 1.00 most likely reflects the fact that the MS is not calibrated. After decomposition, XRD shows that the sample consists of Zn and NaCl, as predicted by equation 2. Accordingly, it is illustrated that heating of a transition metal-alkali metal borohydride, as represented by NaxZny(BH4)x+2y, yields both hydrogen and diborane. In accordance with embodiments of the invention, magnesium hydride, as a representative, relatively low molecular weight, metal hydride is added to the borohydride to suppress formation of diborane. Incorporating MgH2 into the borohydride sample by simply ball milling a mixture of ZnCl2+2 NaBH4+2 MgH2 in the same manner as the additive-free sample was unsuccessful because the sample decomposed during the ball milling itself. Note that a two-fold excess of MgH2 additive is present compared to reaction (3); this was done to ensure that more than sufficient MgH2 was available for reaction. To prevent premature reaction during milling, a precursor sample composed of ZnCl2+2 NaBH4 was first prepared by ball milling at ambient temperature in the same manner as described above in this specification. This ball milling yielded a first powder consisting of NaCl, Na2ZnCl4, and NaxZny(BH4)x+2y, as confirmed by XRD. Particles of MgH2 were then added to the ball milled precursor powder, again with a two-fold molar excess, by lightly grinding the two powders together by hand in a mortar and pestle. The grinding was performed in a glove box to protect the sample from atmospheric exposure. The resulting weight loss behavior, upon heating in the IGA thermo-gravimetric analysis furnace, is shown in FIG. 2. The total weight loss in the decomposition event is 5.44 wt %, and the B2H6/H2 ratio is 0.24, or about 35% of the ratio in the unmodified ZnCl2+NaBH4. Diborane release has thus been reduced by 65% compared to the MgH2-free sample. However, it was unclear whether partial reaction occurred during grinding. XRD of the mixed material was not obtained. It was then determined that ball milling of this illustrative precursor hydrogen storage mixture in a cryogenically-cooled (for example, with liquid nitrogen) ball mill was a more suitable way for preparing reactive precursor compounds. In many embodiments of the invention, such cryomilling is a preferred method of synthesis. Accordingly, a sample of ZnCl2+2 NaBH4+2 MgH2 was directly synthesized by milling the starting powders in a Retsch cryomill, the housing of which was cooled with flowing liquid nitrogen during milling. Powders of the starting constituents (ZnCl2, NaBH4, and MgH2) were loaded into the stainless steel milling jar along with eight 12 mm diameter stainless steel milling balls. The milling apparatus and milling jar were pre-cooled for 2 minutes to allow the jar to reach low temperature before milling began. The powders were milled at a frequency of 25 Hz for a total of 30 min in six 5-min stages separated by 1 min resting intervals at 5 Hz, while liquid nitrogen was circulating around the grinding jar. The cryogenic temperature, near that of liquid nitrogen, prevented premature reaction of the MgH2, but still allowed the formation of the target Na—Zn-borohydride compound. An x-ray diffraction pattern of a sample of the cryomilled material confirmed the presence of the desired borohydride and metal hydride precursor materials, and did not reflect the presence of by-products of premature hydrogen release or of diborane release. Specifically, the XRD confirmed unreacted MgH2. Weight loss from the cryomilled sample was measured using a Hiden Intelligent Gravimetric Analyzer (IGA) while heating the sample from room temperature to 300° C. at 4.2° C./s in flowing He gas, with a mass spectrometer (MS) sampling the exhaust gas. Weight loss of the cryomilled precursors during heating is shown in FIG. 3. This sample had the smallest overall weight loss, 2.72 wt %, in the first decomposition, which is even below the predicted loss. The B2H6/H2 ratio is 0.15, representing 22% of the value for unmodified ZnCl2+2 NaBH4. The 78% reduction in diborane release is the lowest value obtained to date from Na—Zn-borohydride. The additional 0.55 wt % hydrogen release at higher temperature is attributable to the excess MgH2 in the sample. XRD of the decomposed product (not shown) confirms the presence of the expected MgB2 reaction product. It also showed evidence for new product phases such as MgZn2 as well as several as yet unidentified peaks, suggesting that the reaction path is more complex than reaction (3). In accordance with the presented examples, particles of a transition metal chloride (ZnCl2) and an alkali metal borohydride (NaBH4) were reacted by ball milling to form a transition metal-alkali metal borohydride (NaxZny(BH4)x+2y). In this practice, sodium chloride and a sodium zinc chloride are formed as by-products which are diluents in the hydrogen-producing mixture. Obviously, other suitable chlorides, halides, or other compounds of other transition metal may be used as precursors. And other alkali metal compounds may be used as precursors. And the transition metal-alkali metal borohydrides may be separated, when economically justified, from the diluting transition metal-alkali metal by-products. Alternatively, the mixed borohydrides could be formed by alternate synthesis pathways that do not co-produce diluent species such as NaCl. As stated above, a particulate mass of transition metal borohydrides may also be used (without an alkali metal constituent) in the practice of the invention. Magnesium dihydride is a suitable and preferred particulate additive to the borohydride particle hydrogen storage mass for diborane mitigation because of the relatively low molecular weight of the hydride. However, other relatively low molecular weight, relatively high hydrogen-content, solid boride compound forming, metal hydrides may be used. Accordingly, practices are illustrated and disclosed herein, permitting the use of suitable transition metal borohydrides and mixed transition metal-alkali metal borohydrides as a volume or mass of hydrogen-containing particles for the release of hydrogen on demand for use in a hydrogen consuming or hydrogen using device or application. The hydrogen-containing particles are stored at a suitably low temperature and in a suitable container, the temperature and environment being managed to minimize unwanted hydrogen release. Upon demand, or need, hydrogen is released from the borohydride containing particles by heating the mixture at a suitable rate to a suitable temperature. The heating may be continued, or stopped and later continued, until hydrogen is depleted from a suitable mass or volume of the borohydride containing particles. Alternatively, as stated above in this specification, the hydrogen-containing particles may be maintained at a suitable fixed temperature under a suitable pressure of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen can be released on demand by reducing the hydrogen pressure, for example, by withdrawing some of the hydrogen gas to supply a desired hydrogen-using application, such that the particles partially decompose until hydrogen pressure is restored. In order to suppress unwanted release of diborane from the borohydride particles, they are mixed with a suitable metal hydride in an amount for capture of the boron content of the borohydride material.
