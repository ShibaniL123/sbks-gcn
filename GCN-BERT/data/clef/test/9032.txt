A round-bottom flask containing 3-3 (7.07 g, 43.9 mmol, 1 equiv), was evacuated for 5 min before suspending in 1,2-dichloroethane (120 mL) and flushing vessel with argon. Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (11.6 mL, 131.6 mmol, 3 equiv) was slowly added at room temperature, stirring under argon atmosphere. After 60 minutes, reaction was quenched with deionized water, then neutralized with 2M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Organic and aqueous phases were separated, then organic phase was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. Organics were isolated, dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered through coarse (40-60 micron) fritted funnel. Solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the remaining oil was purified by flash chromatography, using a linear gradient from 20% ethyl acetate and 80% hexanes to 40% ethyl acetate and 60% hexanes, yielding intermediate 3-4 (4.23 g, 26.2 mmol, 60% yield). Product was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR in CDCl3.
