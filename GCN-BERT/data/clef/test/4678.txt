Iodide 267 (311 mg, 1.16 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF and cooled to -30 °C. Isopropylmagnesium chloride (0.6 ml, 1.16 mmol) was added dropwise and stirred for 30 minutes at this temperature, followed by addition of a solution of compound 2-7 (214 mg, 0.385 mmol) in THF. The mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 30 minutes and then the reaction was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride solution. The resultant was extracted with ethyl acetate, the organic phase was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated, and directly subjected to the next step. The crude product was dissolved in dichloromethane and DMP (245 mg, 0.580 mmol) was added at 0 °C, the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The next day, the reation was quenched with a mixture of saturated sodium thiosulfate solution and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (saturated sodium thiosulfate solution/saturated sodium bicarbonate solution = 1/1), the resultant was extracted with dichloromethane, washed with brine, concentrated, and purified by column chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl acetate (v/v) = 25/1) to give product 2-8 (87 mg, yield 33%).
