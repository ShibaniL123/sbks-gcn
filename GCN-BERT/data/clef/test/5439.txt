i I8îl GClSS Compounds having the formula RI-NH,,,. ,.* SO2-R2 CH--CH i i o//C NH , wherein RI is one of the simple acyl groups phenylacetyl or phenoxyacetyl, can be treated with a Grignard reagent having the formula II R3 -Mg - X, to yield the corresponding compounds having the formulas IIIa IIIb RI-NH CH-- C'HR3 i i o C -NH , and RI-NH /R3 CH--CH I I o/IC--NH GC185 i0 In the above formulas, and throughout the specification, the symbols are as defined below. R1 is phenylacetyl or phenoxyacetyl; R2 is a not readily enolizable alkyl group, aryl or norbornyl; R3 is alkyl, alken-l-yl, alkyn-l-yl, 2-phenylethenyl, 2-phenylethynyl, aryl or arylalkyl; and X1 is bromine or chlorine, preferably chlorine. Listed below are definitions of various terms used herein. These definitions apply to the terms as they are used throughout the specification (unless they are otherwise limited in specific instances) either individually or as part of a larger group. The term "alkyl" refers to both straight and branched chain groups. Those groups having 1 to i0 carbon atoms are preferred. The term "aryl" refers to pheny! or phenyl substituted with i, 2 or 3 alkyl (of 1 to 4 carbon atoms) or alkoxy (of 1 to 4 carbon atoms) groups. The terms "alken-l-yl" and "alkyn-l-yl" refer to both straight and branched chain groups. Those groups having 2 to i0 carbon atoms are preferred. The term "a not readily enolizable alkyl group" refers to groups that enolize at a rate slower tha the rate of the substitution reaction of this invention. Exemplary of such groups are the branched chain alkyl groups such as isopropyl and -butyl. Those compounds of formula I wherein R2 is norbornyl are novel compounds, and as such, they form an integral part of this invention. GC185 i0 Compounds of formula I are obtained from the well known fermentation products penicillin G (benzyl penicillin), penicillin V, or 6-APA(6aminopenicillanic acid), using any one of several reaction sequences. One such reaction sequence comprises conversion of pen G or pen V to the corresponding sulfoxide ester (see, for example, Cephalosporins and Penicillins, Chemistry and Biology, E. H° Flynn, editor, Academic Press, 1972), followed by rearrangement, in-situ norbornylene trapping and conjugation to give a compound having the formula IV o ji RI-NH CH--CH l I C .... N-C=C (CH3) ; 2 CO2R , wherein the "CO2 R" group is an esterified carboxyl group, such as an alkyl ester or trialkylsilyl ester. Subsequent oxidation and cleavage by treatment with an acid yields the corresponding (3R-cis)-3-acylamino-4-norbornylsulfonyl-2azetidinone having the formula RI-NH /SO CH--CH i I o//C--NH GC185 i0 as a mixture of diastereomers. The mixture can be separated using conventional techniques or preferably, will be used in the next step of the process of this invention as a mixture. Compounds of formula V form an integral part of this invention. Treatment of the above (3R-Çis)-3-acylamino4-norbornylsulfonyl-2-azetidinone with the appropriate mercaptan having the formula R2 -SH in the presence of a base yields the corresponding compound having the formula VI RI-NH cH ...... S-R2 J J oJfCNH (see J. Orq. Chem., 38:940 (1973)), which can be oxidized to yield the desired starting material of formula fo Alternatively, pen G or pen V can be converted to 6-APA, which can be converted to a compound having the formula VII /SO2-CH3 A-NH cH CH i i o//C .... NH (see J. Chem. Soc., Perkin I, 562 (1975)). Treatment of a compound of formula VII wi h sodium aryl sulfinate in the presence of tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide under phase transfer conditions gives the corresponding GC185 compound having the formula i0 VIII A-NH cH__ciHSO2 -aryl i I o C--NH Deprotection of a compound of formula VIII followed by acylation yields the desired starting material of formula I (wherein R2 is aryl) as a mixture of the cis and trans isomers, which are separable by fractional crystallization and/or column chromatography° The conversion of a compound of formula I to a mixture of compounds of formulas IIIa and IIIb is accomplished by treating a compound of formula I with a Grignard reagent of formula II, preferably in the presence of a Lewis acid. Magnesium chloride is the preferred Lewis acid. The conversion is accomplished most efficiently using an excess of Grignard reagent, preferably three (3) molar equivalents, and most preferably, four (4) or five (5) molar equivalents. Preferably about four (4) to six (6) molar equivalents of Lewis acid are used. GC185 A mixture of compounds of formulas IIIa and IIIb can be separated using art-recognized techniques such as column chromatography and fractional crystallization. The compounds of formulas IIIa and IIIb can be converted to the corresponding compound having the formula i0 IX RI-NHkcH ÆR3 CH J I ee o//C N-SO3M , wherein M is hydrogen or a cation, using the procedures described in United Kingdom patent application 2,071,6501 AS described therein, a sulfo substituent (-SO3M )- can be added to the 1-position of an azetidin-2-one by treatment of the azetìdin-2-one with a complex of pyridine, 2,6-1utidine or dimethylformamide and sulfur trioxide. An alternative procedure described by the United Kingdom patent comprises silylating an azetidin-2-one (unsubstituted in the 1-position) and then subjecting the silated compound to a silyl interchange reaction. Exemplary silylating agents are monosilyltrifluoroacetamide, trimethylsilylchloride/triethyl nine, and bis-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide, and an exemplary reagent useful for the silyl interchange reaction is trimethylsilyl chlorosulfonate. GC185 i0 A compound of formula IX can be converted to the corresponding compound having the formula X NH ÆR 3 CH--CH 3 I I e o//C--N-SO3 by treatment with phosgene followed by treatment with methanol and acid. Using conventional acylation techniques, a compound of formula X can be converted to the corresponding compound having the formula XI acyl -NH cH__C H R3 j I e, ..... N-SO3 M As described in United Kingdom patent application 2,071,650, a compound of formula X can be reactedwitha carboxylic acid, or corresponding carboxylic acid halide or anhydride. The reaction with a carboxylic acid proceeds most readily in the presence of a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and a substance capab]e of forming an active ester in situ such as N-hydroxybenzotriazole. In those instances when the acyl group contains reactive functionality (such as amino or carboxyl groups) it i0 may be necessary to first protect those functional groups, then carry out the acylation reaction, and finally deprotect the resulting product. The 8-1actam antibiotics of formula XI can be used as agents to combat bacterial infections (including urinary tract infections and respiratory infections) in mammalian species, such as domesticated animals and humans. The prior art discloses that for combating bacterial infections in mammals a compound of formula XI can be administered to a mammal in need thereof in an amount of about 1.4 mg/kg/day to about 350 mg/kg/day, preferably about 14 mg/kg/day to about i00 mg/kg/dayo The following examples are specific embodiments of this invention.
