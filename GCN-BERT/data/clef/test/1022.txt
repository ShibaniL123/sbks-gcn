(E)-3,3-dimethyl-1-nitrobut-1-ene
A solution of 3,3-dimethyl-1-nitrobutan-2-ol (10 g, 67.9 mmol) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was cooled to −10° C. under N2, treated with 2,2,2-trifluoroacetic anhydride (15.70 g, 74.7 mmol), stirred at −15° C. for 5 minutes, and treated dropwise with triethylamine (20.84 mL, 149 mmol) keeping the bath at −15° C. during the addition. The mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 3 hours, treated with saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (300 mL), and stirred for 5 minutes. The CH2Cl2 layer was isolated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2×150 mL). The combined CH2Cl2 layers were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated. The crude material was purified by column chromatography (ethyl acetate/petroleum ether=1/200) to provide the title compound (6.8 g, 48.4 mmol, 71.3% yield).
