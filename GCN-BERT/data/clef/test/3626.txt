i!:/- lO 588 2 2 6 This invention relates generally to processes for depositing reflective coatings on the inner surfaces of lamp bulbs and more particularly to methods of masking areas of said bulbs which are to remain clear. In the manufacture of reflector lamps a portion of the bulb is internally coated with reflective material before the bulb is sealed to a mount or sub-assembly of internal elements The coating operation is generally effected by vaporizing a quantity of metal such as aluminum, silver or gold within the bulb after the latter has been evacuated. The vaporized metal fS %hereby deposited upon exposed interior surfaces to the bulb. Surfaces which are intended to be kept clear .to permit passages of light therethrough are suitably masked during the coating operation. It has been found convenient to employ a measured quantity of granular material, such as small glass beads, to cover the portion of such bulbs which is to be left clear. In the conventional method of masking with such material, the bulb which includes an open neck and a closed bowl portion is supported in a vertical neck-up position. The granular material is then poured into the bowl portion through the neck. Thereafter the bulb is rotated, oscillated or otherwise agitated to distribute the masking material in order to provide an even mask line which defines the end of the coated portion. The conventional method has a number of serious disadvantages. In the first place, the movement of the bulb to iJ< : ¸i,.¸I¸. ¸• i ï,i !:ill• !ii: t:i i :i i::iii::> i i0 iCï! " 588226 :i distribute the masking material is time consuming and the coating process is accordingly slowed down. Another disadvantage is that variations in the distributing motions result in irregularity of the mask line. Still another disadvantage is that, the absence of control over the coating material whíle it is being poured into the bulb and thereafter agitated by movement of the latter allows grains or beads to be deposited on the portion of the bulb which is to be coated. These beads leave objectionable pinholes in the coating when they are removed after the completion of the coating operation lfi is accordingly an object of our invention to provide a method for distributing granular masking materia! within lamp bulbs to provide an even mask line. Another object is to provide a method of obtaining an even mask line without the need of moving the masking material after it is initially delivered to the bulb. A further object is to provide a method of introducing masking material into a bulb with such control over the material that adhesion of particles to the wall of the bulb is substantially eliminated. The foregoing and other objects are achieved in accordance with our inventìon by employing a tube which restricts and directs motion of the masking material as it is delivered to the bulb. The tube is positioned vertically in the bulb which is supported in neck-up position. The lower end of the tube is maintained close to the inside of the bow1 portion of he bulb which effectively closes the tube to passage of i/ iil i0 :i i :'4•' I!i' i ... 588226 material therethrough. The masking material is then poured into the tube which is thereafter raised thereby effecting an even flow of material in all directions. The resulting body of masking material in the bulb has an upper surface which provides an even mask line without further displacement of !the masking material. Further objects and advantages of our invention will appear from the following detailed description of one of its species taken in connection with the accompanying drawing in which: Figure i is a view in elevation and partly in section of a lamp including a bulb having a reflective coating with the application of which our invention is related Figure 2 is a view in elevation of a bulb showing a tube positioned therein to receive masking material; Figure 3 is a view in elevation of the bulb after the masking material has been poured into the tube; and Figure 4 is a view in elevation of the bulb showing the disposition of the masking material therein as the tube is removed. Turning to the drawings a lamp including a bulb or envelope, indicated at i0 and having an internal reflective coating 12 is shown in Fig. I. It will be convenient at the outset to think of the envelope as including a face 14 and a rear portion 16. The face 14 is kept clear by being masked during the coating operation whereas the reflective coating 12 which terminates at a mask line 18 is applied to the ii! i!!ii il ( ,, • i • - i i¸ g 58822ç portion 16. A neck 20 is part of the portion 16 and supports a base 22. Lead-in wires 24 sealed in the bulb i0 support a filament 25 between their inner ends and are connected at their outer ends tic appropriate terminals on the base 22. With reference to Figures 2-4 we will now describe our method of depositing granular masking material such as a body of glass beads 26 into the bulb i0 to produce an even mask line 18. As shown in these views, the bulb I0 is supported in neck-up position in a suitable cradle or nest 28. The bulb i0 is preferably provided with additional lateral support such as a V-shaped member 30. A tube 32 is positioned into the vertically supported bulb i0 with the lower end of the tube in close proximity to the face li or in actual contact with it. In order to facilitate the pouring of beads 26 into the tube 32 the upper end portìon of the latter may conveniently be funnel-shaped as shown. With the tube 32 held central and vertical in the bulb i0, a measured quantity of beads 26 is poured into the tube, the lower end of which is effectively closed by the face li as shown in Figure 3. Thereafter, the tube 32 is withdrawn upwardly to free the beads 26 which travel evenly in all directions under the vertical pressure of the beads above them in the tube. Best results are obtained in distributing the beads 26 evenly if the tube 32 is raised without introducing a sizable horizonI l tal motion component. After the face 14 has been masked by our method, the • i i0 : . il 58822G reflective coating 12 may be applied to the portion 16 of the bulb I0 by a conventional process not otherwise related to our invention. In applying the coating, a small quantity of aluminum, for instance, is placed on an electrically energized vaporizer element inside the bulb I0. The neck 20 is suitably sealed; the bulb is then evacuated; and the vaporizer element is energized to flash the coating metal onto exposed internal surfaces of the bulb i0.
