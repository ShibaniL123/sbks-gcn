Thìs invention relates to cartons, and more particularly, to cartons of fîbrous material, such as cardboard, for packaging ice cream and other frozen comestibles: one object of the present invention being to provide an improved carton having a more practical and efficient construction, for packaging ice cream and the like and which can be easily opened without peeling of the fibrous material of which the carton is made. Another object of the invention is to provide a carton having the above advantages which is formed from a single blank of cardboard material scored and folded in box form with a cover securing flap having a flexible tab which can be readily graspedto release the flap and cover for removal of the contents of the carton. Still a further object is to provide a carton of the above nature which can be readily and economically manufactured and conveniently handled in use. l To these and other ends the invention resides in certain Improvements and combinations of parts, all as will be hereinafter more fully described, the novel features being pointed out in the claims at the end of the SpecifiCation. In the drawings: Fig. i is a plan view of a one-plece blank cut and scored, ready for folding to form a carton embodying the present invention; Fig. 2 is a fragmentary top plan view of the cover and sealing flap showing the securing flap folded back on itself; 50544 j:: Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing the carton assembled and sealed; Fig. 4 is a fragmentary sectional elevation substantially along line 4--4 in Fig. 3, and Fig. 5 is similar to Fig. 4, but shows the securing flap pulled away from the front of the carton and the cover partially opened. The invention is embodied in the present instance in a container made from a cardboard blank, such as shown in Fig. l, cut from stock, the entire surface of both sides of which may be coated or otherwise treated with paraffin, or other waxes, or cellulose lacquers, or other known materials, to render the same impervious to moisture, vapor, water and grease. The blank is preferably scored, as indicated by multiple lining in the drawings to form bottom, front and back wall portions ll, 12 and 13, respectively, (Fig. l) and a cover portion 14, which in the present instance are rectangular in shape so as to produce, when folded, a straight-walled container. The bottom ll is provided at opposite ends thereof with inner end flaps 15 and 16. The front wall is provided at opposite ends thereof with end flaps 17 and 18 which have an L-shaped slit• 19 cut therein forming part of the closure means as hereafter described. Rear wall 13 has at opposite ends thereof flaps 21 and 22, the outer ends of which are tongue-shaped and are adapted to pass through slits 19 in flaps 17 and 18, respectively, to secure the carton in an erected position as well 50544 understood in the art. The cover 14 has at opposite ends thereof end flaps 23 and 24 which are adapted to be folded downwardly within the carton to insure proper closure at the upper edges of the ends of the carton. The carton cover is provided with a novel securing flap shown generally at 25 (Fig. l) by means of which the carton can be readily opened without causing peeling of the fibrous material of which the carton is made. Flap 25 is integrally and hingedly connected with cover portion 14 by a score line 26 and has a free edge 27 at the opposite side thereof. Flap has substantially midway between fold line 26 and free edge 27 a pair of longitudinally aligned score lines 28 and 29 extending inwardly from the opposite free edges of said flap. A longitudinally extending sllt 31 is formed in flap 25 substantially midway between score lines 28 and 29 and free edge 27, so as to lie in a position spaced transversely and offset from score lines 28 and 29. A pair of substantially transverse slits 32 and 33 connect the inner ends of score lines 28 and 29 with the respective outer ends of slit 31 and together with said score lines divide securing flap 25 into an inner portion 34 and an outer hinged portion 35. Outer portion 35 is adapted to be reversely folded back on inner portion 34 as shown in Fig. 2 and is secured thereto by adhesive 36 (Fig. l) located adjacent score line 26. Outer flap portion 35 is securely fastened in the above position prior to shipping the unassembled blank to a purchaser for use and has an adhesive 37 on the exposed surface thereof adjacent free edge 27 for securing flap 25 to front wall 50544 12 as. hereafter described. With Outer• portion 35 secured in ,the above position, the center Pot,tion" of inner portion 34extends outwardly»and forms ,a, tab or handle 39, the.free edgç« of:which ma be easily-grasped f,or òpening.the carton as shown , ,.ínFígs:? 3, 4 and 5. , The blank is erected to form the container by fol, ding thê front and rear walls 12 and 13 and end flaps 15 and i 16 vertlcálly upward, as' usual, after which end flaps 17 and ç t 18 are folded rearwardly and end flaps 21 and 22 are folded forward in overlying position, therewith, respective1 y. The outer tongue portions of flaps 21 and 22 are inserted through and-i ìn sí1 ts 19 9f flaps 17 and 18, respectively,, as" we11 understood in the art. Up.on ' !ìloEng the' container wí, th ice cream'or the,lika,, end'f laps 23 and 24 are folded so as to: "extenã transverselytó cóver l which is thereafter folded• ' "" downwardly b, close " " , , the upper, portìon of the carton. Securing ,flap 25 is folded about score llne 26 'and is brought into con- .tact 'with a d/securely fastened to the outer surface of front ' Wal! 12,.by adhesive-37, thus effecting a posltlveclosure of , b » ,the carton as shown in,Figs. 3 and 4 and as well understood in ' the art. When the consumer is ready "to open the carton,-tab 38 may be gra, sped pulling sealingflap 25 away from front wall 12 and rupturing the adhesive strip 37 as shown inFig. l Then the ends are opened by disengaging the opposite pairs of interlocked outer end flaps 21 and 17 and 22 and 18, respectively. The contents of the carton will then be left freely exposed, resting on the bottom II of the carton, and may be readily sliced or removed as a whole. Free edge 27 which forms the inner upper edge of the sealing flap provides a discontinuity of fibrous structure and a llne of separation thereby preventing the peeling of the fibrous surface layer from said flap portion. That is, any segments of outer flap section 35 which tend to peel off said section as the carton is opened as shown in Fig. 5, will quickly be stripped back to free edge 27 beyond which they cannot extend. Similarly the material tending to peel from the outer upper edge of the front wall 12 will be checked when the peeling reaches the upper free edge of said front wall. Thus it will be seen that the above invention provides a strong, readily manufactured and assembled carton, adapted for use with ice cream or similar comestibles. The novel securing flap not only prevents material from peeling from the caíton and interfering with the removal of the contents thereof, but it also provides a convenient tab by which the securing flap may be grasped to open the carton. In addition, the above securing flap requires less material, provides a more flexible pull tab and is more attractive in appearance than the double thickness securing flaps heretofore used in the art. The outwardly decreasing width of tab 38 provides a short grasping edge and thus evenly distributes the force required token the carton along adhesive 37. This insures an even and unlformopening and prevents tearing of the securing flap or cover. It will thus be seen that the invention accomplishes its objects and while it has been herein disclosed by reference to the details of a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that such disclosure is intended in an illustrative, rather than a limiting sense, as it is contemplated that various modifications in the construction and arrangement of the parts will readily occur to those skilled in the art, within the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. 5O544 The embodiments of the invention in which an I.
