FIELD OF INVENTION Non-human animals having a replacement of the endogenous non-human animal IL-6 and/or IL-6 receptor genes are provided. IL-6 and/or IL-6 receptor genes of the non-human animal are replaced, at the endogenous non-human loci, with human IL-6 and/or humanized IL-6 receptor genes comprising human sequence. Non-human animals that have human IL-6 and/or humanized IL-6 receptor genes, wherein the non-human animals do not exhibit one or more pathologies that are characteristic of non-human animals transgenic for human IL-6. BACKGROUND Mice transgenic for a human IL-6 gene are known in the art. However, random insertion of a human IL-6 transgene into the mouse genome results in poorly regulated expression of the human IL-6 protein, which manifests itself in a variety of pathologies in such transgenic mice, including, but not limited to, plasmacytosis and glomerulonephritis. As a result, these mice have limited usefulness. There is a need for non-human animals, e.g., mice and rats, the express human or humanized IL-6 and/or human or humanized IL-6 receptor. There is a need for such humanized mice that do not exhibit one or more pathologies exhibited by transgenic hIL-6 mice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION IL-6 and IL-6R The IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) was long characterized as a receptor for a B cell stimulatory factor (BSF-2, or B cell Stimulatory Factor 2; also, BCDF, or B Cell Differentiation Factor) responsible for inducing B cells to synthesize immunoglobulin (Yamasaki et al. (1988) Cloning and Expression of the Human Interleukin-6(BSF-2/IFβ 2) Receptor, Science 241:825-828). IL-6 was first described as interferon-β2 as the result of its discovery during a search for a virally-induced protein termed interfereon-β, by treating human fibroblasts with dsRNA poly(l)poly(C) to induce an anti-viral response (Weissenbach et al. (1980) Two interferon mRNAs in human fibroblasts: In vitro translation and Escherichia coli cloning studies, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 77(12):7152-7156; Keller et al. (1996) Molecular and Cellular Biology of Interleukin-6 and Its Receptor, Frontiers in Bioscience 1:d340-357). The human cDNA encodes a 468 amino acid protein having a 19-mer signal sequence and a cytoplasmic domain of about 82 amino acids that lacks a tyrosine kinase domain (see, Id.). The N-terminal (ectodomain) of the protein has an Ig superfamily domain of about 90 amino acids, a 250-amino acid domain between the Ig superfamily domain and the membrane, a transmembrane span of about 28 amino acids (see, Id.). The ectodomain of the receptor binds its ligand IL-6, which triggers association with gp130 in the membrane and it is this complex that conducts signal transduction; the cytoplasmic domain reportedly does not transduce signal (Taga et al. (1989) Interleukin-6 Triggers the Association of Its Receptor with a Possible Signal Transducer, gp130, Cell 58:573-581). Indeed, a soluble form of IL-6R lacking a cytoplasmic domain can associate with IL-6 and bind gp130 on the surface of a cell and effectively transduce signal (Id.). The homology of hIL-6R and mIL-6R at the protein level is only about 54%; the transmembrane domain has a homology of about 79%, whereas the cytoplasmic domain has a homology of about 54% (Sugito et al. (1990)). The natural ligand for the IL-6R, IL-6, was first isolated from cultures of HTLV-1-transformed T cells (see, Hirano et al. (1985) Purification to homogeneity and characterization of human B cell differentiation factor (BCDF or BSFp-2), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5490-5494). A human cDNA for the IL-6 gene was cloned at least twice, once as BSF-2 (see, Hirano et al. (1086) Complementary DNA from a novel human interleukin (BSF-2) that induces B lymphocytes to produce immunoglobulin, Nature 324:73-76) and once as IFNβ 2 (see, Zilberstein et al. (1986) Structure and expression of cDNA and genes for human interferon-beta-2, a distinct species inducible by growth-stimulatory cytokines, EMBO 5:2529-2537), although it has since been demonstrated that recombinant human IL-6 exhibits no detectable IFN activity. Human IL-6 is a 184-amino acid protein that exhibits only about 42% homology with mouse IL-6, although the genomic organization of the human and mouse genes are basically the same, and the promoter regions of the human and mouse genes share a 400-bp stretch that is highly conserved (see, Tanabe et al. (1988) Genomic Structure of the Murine IL-6 Gene: High Degree Conservation of Potential Regulatory Sequences between Mouse and Human, J. Immunol. 141(11):3875-3881). The human IL-6 gene is about 5 kb (Yasukawa et al. (1987) Structure and expression of human B cell stimulatory factor-2 (BSC-2/IL-6) gene, EMBO J. 6(10):2939-2945), whereas the mouse IL-6 gene is about 7 kb (Tanabe et al. (1988) Genomic Structure of the Murine IL-6 Gene: High Degree Conservation of Potential Regulatory Sequences between Mouse and Human, J. Immunol. 141(11):3875-3881). The mouse and human IL-6 genes reportedly share highly conserved 5′-flanking sequence important to regulation. A schematic diagram of the human and mouse IL-6 genomic loci is shown in FIG. 1 (not to scale). Exons I, II, III, IV, and V (in both human and mouse) are indicated by closed boxes to the right in the figure. Selected putative regulatory regions are indicated by open boxes to the left in the figure. The putative regulatory regions for humans are, from left to right, a glucocorticoid element from −557 to −552; an IFN enhancer core sequence from −472 to −468; a glucocorticoid element from −466 to −461; an AT-rich region from −395 to −334, a consensus AP-1 binding site from −383 to −277; an IFN enhancer core sequence from −253 to −248; a GGAAA-containing motif from −205 to −192; a c-fos SRE homology sequence from −169 to −82 containing an IFN enhancer core sequence, a cAMP-response element, a GGAAA motif, a CCAAT box, and a GC-rich region; and AP-1 binding site from −61 to −55; and a CCAAT box from −34 to −30. The putative regulatory regions for mouse are, from left to right, a GC rich region from −553 to −536, a glucocorticoid element from −521 to −516 and from −500 to −495; a Z-DNA stretch from −447 to −396; an AP-1 binding site overlapping an IFN enhancer core sequence from −277 to −288, a GGAAA motif overlapping an IFN enhancer core sequence from −210 to −195; a c-fos SRE homology region from −171 to −82 containing a cAMP response element, a GGAAA motif overlapping an IFN enhancer core sequence, and a GC-rich region; and, an AP-1 binding site from −61 to −55. Mouse codons I-V have lengths 19, 185, 114, 150, and 165, respectively. Mouse intron lengths are: I-II, 162 bp; II-III, 1253 bp; III-IV, 2981 bp; IV-V, 1281 bp. Human codons I-V have lengths 19, 191, 114, 147, and 165. Human intron lengths are I-II, 154; II-III, 1047; III-IV, 706; IV-V, 1737. Genomic organization data are from Tanabe et al. (1988), and Yasukawa et al. (1987) Structure and expression of human B cell stimulatory factor-2 (BSF-2/IL-6) gene, EMBO J. 9(10):2939-2945. It might be reasonable to presume that the mouse and human IL-6 genes appear to be similarly regulated based on the similarity of their 5′-flanking sequence. A variety cell types exhibit enhanced IL-6 expression in response to IL-1, TNF, PDGF, IFNβ 3, serum, poly(l)poly(C), and cycloheximide (see, Tanabe et al. (1988). IL-6 in humans mediates the acute phase response, hematopoiesis, B cell differentiation, T cell activation, growth and/or differentiation and/or activation of a variety of cell types (e.g., hepatocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neurons, pituitary cells, lymphomas, myelomas, breast carcinomas, NK cells, macrophages, osteoclasts, etc.) (reviewed in, e.g., Heinrich et al. (1990), Kishimoto et al. (1989), and Keller et al. (1996); Sugita et al. (1990) Functional Murine Interleukin Receptor with Intracisternal A Particle Gene Product at its Cytoplasmic Domain, J. Exp. Med. 171:2001-2009). In practice, however, mice transgenic for human IL-6 exhibit a panoply of substantial and debilitating pathologies, reflecting a significant pleiotropy of the IL-6 gene. Transgenic mice comprising a 6.6-kb fragment containing the human IL-6 gene and a μ enhancer (4) produce high concentrations of hIL-6 and extremely high IgG1 levels (120- to 400-fold over wild-type mice), reflecting an IL-6 deregulation that is accompanied by plasmacytosis, mesangio-proliferative glomerulonephritis, and high bone marrow megakaryocyte levels (Suematsu et al. (1989) IgG1 plasmacytosis in interleukin 6 transgenic mice, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 86:7547-7551). Aberrant regulation of IL-6 and/or IL-6R is associated with myelomas, plastocytomas, rheumatoid arthritis, Castleman's disease, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, cardiac myxoma, plams cell neoplasias, psoriasis, and other disorders (see, Kishimoto, T. (1989) The Biology of Interleukin-6, Blood 74(1):1-10; Sugita et al. (1990); also, Hirano et al. (1990) Biological and clinical aspects of interleukin 6, Immunology Today 11(12):443-449)). IL-6 is also implicated in sustaining levels of intra-prostatic androgens during androgen deprivation treatment of prostate cancer patients by a paracrine and/or autocrine mechanism, potentially providing castration-resistant prostate tumor growth (Chun et al. (2009) Interleukin-6 Regulates Androgen Synthesis in Prostate Cancer Cells, Clin. Cancer Res. 15:4815-4822). The human protein is encoded as a 212 amino acid protein, in mature form a 184 amino acid protein following cleavage of a 28 amino acid signal sequence. It contains two N-glycosylation and two 0-glycosylation sites, and human IL-6 is phosphorylated in some cells. The mouse protein is encoded as a 211 amino acid protein, in mature form a 187 amino acid protein following cleavage of a 23 amino acid signal sequence. 0-glycosylation sites are present, but not N-glycosylation sites. (See reviews on IL-6, e.g., Heinrich et al. (1990) Interleukin-6 and the acute phase response, Biochem. J. 265:621-636.) IL-6 function is pleiotropic. The IL-6 receptor is found on activated B cells but reportedly not on resting B cells. In contrast, IL-6R is found on resting T cells and can reportedly promote T cell differentiation, activation, and proliferation, including the differentiation of T cells into cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the presence of IL-2. Humanized IL-6/IL-6R Ectodomain Mice and IL-6-Mediated Acute Phase Response In humans, IL-6 induces the acute phase response. Early studies with human hepatocytes established that IL-6 induces acute phase proteins such as, e.g., C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (reviewed in Heinrich et al. (1990) Interleukin-6 and the acute phase response, Biochem. J. 265:621-636). Non-human animals, e.g., mice or rats, comprising humanized IL-6 and IL-6R genes are therefore useful systems for measuring the acute phase response mediated by human IL-6. Such animals are also useful for determining whether a substance induces an IL-6-mediated acute phase response, by exposing a humanized IL-6/IL-6R animal as described herein to the substance, and measuring a level of one or more acute phase response proteins (or RNAs). In one embodiment, the humanized animal is exposed to the substance in the presence of an antagonist of a human IL-6R, and a level of one or more acute phase response proteins (or RNAs) is measured, wherein a reduction in a level of an acute phase response protein (or RNA) in the presence of the human IL-6R antagonist indicates a human IL-6R-mediated acute phase response. Human IL-6 can bind both human IL-6R and mouse IL-6R; mouse IL-6 binds mouse IL-6R but not human IL-6R (no binding of mIL-6 to hIL-6R detectable, whereas hIL-6 can compete with mIL-6 for binding mIL-6R; Coulie et al. (1989) High- and low-affinity receptors for murine interleukin 6. Distinct distribution on B and T cells, Eur. J. Immunol. 19:2107-211); see also, e.g., Peters et al. (1996) The Function of the Soluble Interleukin 6 (IL-6) Receptor In Vivo: Sensitization of Human Soluble IL-6 Receptor Transgenic Mice Towards IL-6 and Prolongation of the Plasma Half-life of IL-6, J. Exp. Med. 183:1399-1406). Thus, human cells that bear hIL-6R in a mouse (e.g., in a xenogenic transplant) cannot rely on endogenous mIL-6 to carry out IL-6-mediated functions, including but not limited to the role of IL-6 blood cell or lymphocyte development (e.g., hematopoiesis, B cell activation, T cell activation, etc.). In a mixed in vivo system comprising a wild-type mouse IL-6 gene and a human IL-6R gene (but no mouse IL-6R gene), an acute phase response inducer is not expected to induce detectable levels of acute phase proteins that would indicate an acute phase response. However, a humanized mouse as described herein, comprising a humanized IL-6 gene and an IL-6R gene comprising a humanized ectodomain sequence will respond to an acute phase response inducer and exhibit acute phase response proteins in serum. Mice wild-type for IL-6/IL-6R tested for acute phase proteins in the presence or absence of the acute phase inducer turpentine showed a turpentine-dependent increase in acute phase proteins. Mice with humanized IL-6 gene, but not IL-6R, showed no acute phase response in the presence of turpentine. But mice bearing both a human IL-6 gene and an IL-6R gene with a humanized ectodomain exhibited a strong acute phase response (FIG. 2). The IL-6-mediated acute phase response was IL-6 dependent in both wild-type mice (FIG. 3, top) and in humanized IL-6/IL-6R ectodomain mice (FIG. 3, bottom), as evidenced by the ability of the appropriate anti-IL-6R antibody to abrogate the acute phase response at a sufficiently high antibody dose. Thus, a double humanization of IL-6 and IL-6R recapitulates the wild-type IL-6-mediated acute phase response with respect to serum acute phase proteins. Genetically Modified Mice Genetically modified mice are provided that express a human IL-6 and/or a humanized IL-6 receptor from endogenous mouse loci, wherein the endogenous mouse IL-6 gene and/or the endogenous mouse IL-6 receptor gene have been replaced with a human IL-6 gene and/or a human sequence comprising a sequence that encodes an ectodomain of a human IL-6 receptor. The genetically modified mice express the human IL-6 and/or humanized IL-6 receptor from humanized endogenous loci that are under control of mouse promoters and/or mouse regulatory elements. The replacement(s) at the endogenous mouse loci provide non-human animals that express human IL-6 and a humanized IL-6 receptor in a manner that does not result in the panoply of substantial pathologies observed in IL-6 transgenic mice known in the art. Transgenic mice that express human IL-6 are known in the art. However, they generally suffer from significant pathologies that severely limit their usefulness. Humanized mice as described herein express a human IL-6 and/or humanized IL-6 receptor under the control of endogenous mouse regulatory elements at endogenous mouse IL-6 and IL-6Rα loci. These mice, in contrast, exhibit expression patterns with respect to these genes that are different from transgenic mice known in the art. Replacement of non-human genes in a non-human animal with homologous or orthologous human genes or human sequences, at the endogenous non-human locus and under control of endogenous promoters and/or regulatory elements, can result in a non-human animal with qualities and characteristics that may be substantially different from a typical knockout-plus-transgene animal. In the typical knockout-plus-transgene animal, an endogenous locus is removed or damaged and a fully human transgene is inserted into the animal's genome and presumably integrates at random into the genome. Typically, the location of the integrated transgene is unknown; expression of the human protein is measured by transcription of the human gene and/or protein assay and/or functional assay. Inclusion in the human transgene of upstream and/or downstream human sequences are apparently presumed to be sufficient to provide suitable support for expression and/or regulation of the transgene no matter where in the animal's genome the transgene winds up. But in many cases the transgene with human regulatory elements expresses in a manner that is unphysiological or otherwise unsatisfactory, and can be actually detrimental to the animal. In contrast, the inventors demonstrate that a replacement with human sequence at an endogenous locus under control of endogenous regulatory elements provides a physiologically appropriate expression pattern and level that results in a useful humanized animal whose physiology with respect to the replaced gene are meaningful and appropriate and context of the humanized animal's physiology. Fertilized mouse eggs injected with a construct having the MHC class I promoter H2 and a β-globin intron driving expression of a 695-bp mouse IL-6 gene reportedly produce mice that constitutively express mouse IL-6 at relatively high levels (as compared with wild-type mice) (see, Woodrofe et al. (1992) Long-Term Consequences of Interleukin-6 Overexpression in Transgenic Mice, DNA and Cell Biology 11(8):587-592). But these mice are prone to develop lymphomas associated with the intestines, lymph nodes, and kidney, as well as splenic amyloid deposits. They also exhibit abnormal B cell maturation (see, Woodrofe et al., Id.), so that studies of B cell function are compromised. In contrast, mice as described herein that comprise a replacement of the mouse IL-6 gene with a human IL-6 gene at the mouse IL-6 locus are not prone to develop these lymphomas, and the mice exhibit apparently normal B cell populations. Mice (C57BL/6) transgenic for hIL-6 due to a random insertion of a 6.6-kb (BamHI-Pvu II fragment) length of human DNA containing the hIL-6 gene coupled with an IgM enhancer have been reported (see, Suematsu et al. (1989) IgG1 plasmocytosis in interleukin 6 transgenic mice, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:7547-7551). The mice express hIL-6 at between 800 pg/mL and 20,000 pg/mL in serum, where wild-type mice typically express only about 100 pg/mL IL-6. The mice exhibit an increase in serum Ig (120 to 400-fold over wild-type mice) and a decrease in albumin as they age. The mice suffer from a massive plasmacytosis, exhibit splenomegaly and lymph node enlargement, as well as exhibiting plasma cells and increased megakaryocytes in bone marrow. Upon inspection, what appear to be enlarged lymph nodes are instead massed of compacted abnormal plasma cells. Both spleen and thymus exhibit massive proliferation of plasma cells, which also infiltrate portions of the lung, liver, and kidney. Kidney in these mice also exhibits IL-6-stimulated mesangial cell proliferation typical of mesangio-proliferative glomerulonephritis. Similarly, mice (BALB/c) transgenic for a trimmed hIL-6 cDNA driven by a mouse H-2Ld promoter randomly inserted into the genome display severe plasmacytosis (see, Suematsu et al. (1992) Generation of plasmacytomas with the chromosomal translocation t(12;15) in interleukin 6 transgenic mice, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:232-235). Although C57BL/6 mice that overexpress hIL-6 do not develop transplantable plasmacytomas (they do exhibit plasmacytosis), transgenic BL/6 mice back-crossed into BALB/c mice reportedly do. Random transgenesis of a hIL-6 cDNA driven by a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene promoter reportedly results in hIL-6 overexpression in the mouse central nervous system, which also leads to significant pathologies (see, Campbell et al. (1993) Neurologic disease induced in transgenic mice by cerebral overexpression of interleukin 6, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:10061-10065). These mice exhibit extensive neuropathology and reactive astrocytosis resulting from IL-6 expression in the CNS due to loss of control as the result of random integration of an IL-6 transgene at an apparently CNS-permissive transcriptional locus. Although expression of hIL-6 cDNA linked to a β-globin 3′-UTR and driven by a neuron-specific enolase promoter microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs (F1 C57BL/6×BALB/c) produced mice with a normal lifespan and without apparent neurological defects that expressed hIL-6 in neurons but not elsewhere (see, Fattor et al. (1994) IL-6 Expression in Neurons of Transgenic Mice Causes Reactive Astrocytosis and Increase in Ramified Microglial Cells But No Neuronal Damage, Eur. J. Neuroscience 7:2441-2449), the mice exhibited high levels (20- to 30-fold higher than wild-type) of activated and enlarged astrocytes with increased processes throughout the brain, as well as a 10- to 15-fold increase in ramified microglial cells in white matter. Thus, brain expression of IL-6 reportedly leads to conditions that range from reactive astrocytosis to frank and profound neuropathology. Microinjection into fertilized eggs of an F1 cross of C57BL/6x″DBAII″ mice of a 639-bp hIL-6 cDNA linked to a β-globin 3′-UTR and a mouse MT-1 promoter reportedly produced a transgenic mouse in which the hIL-6 gene was randomly integrated produced a weakened and diseased mouse that dies young of kidney failure (see Fattori et al. (1994) Blood, Development of Progressive Kidney Damage and Myeloma Kidney in Interleukin-6 Transgenic Mice, Blood 63(9):2570-2579). Transgenic mice expired at 12-20 weeks and exhibited elevated levels of α1 and β-globulins in plasma, hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated megakaryocytes in spleen (3-fold higher than wild-type) and bone marrow, plasmacytosis of lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes) characterized by abnormal and compactly arranged plasmocytoid cells, and glomerulonephritis leading to glomerulosclerosis similar to multiple myeloma. Microinjection into fertilized eggs of a C57BL/6J mouse of a H-2Ld-driven hIL-6 cDNA caused IL-6-dependent muscle wasting in mice, characterized in part by a significantly lower gastrocnemius muscle weight in transgenic mice as compared to weight-matched controls, a difference that was ameliorated by treatment with an IL-6 antagonist (see, Tsujinaka et al. (1996) Interleukin 6 Receptor Antibody Inhibits Muscle Atrophy and Modulates Proteolytic Systems in Interleukin 6 Transgenic Mice, J. Clin. Invest. 97(1):244-249). At 12 weeks these mice displayed serum hIL-6 levels of more than 600,000 pg/mL. The transgenic mice also had livers that weighed about 1,242 mg, as compared to control livers that were about 862 mg. Transgenic mice treated with IL-6 antagonist had livers that weighed about 888 mg. Muscle cathepsins B and B+L were significantly higher (20-fold and 6.2-fold) in transgenic mice than in controls, a phenomenon that was eliminated in transgenic mice treated with an IL-6 antagonist. cathepsin B and L mRNAs were estimated to be about 277% and 257%, respectively, as compared with wild-type mice; the difference was significantly reduced with IL-6 antagonist treatment. Mice comprising a hIL-6 minigene driven by a mouse MHC class I H-2Ld promoter and a hIL-6R minigene driven by a chicken β-actin promoter, and a gp130 gene, exhibited pathologies typical of hIL-6 transgenic mice (e.g., hepergammaglobulinemia, splenomegaly, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, lung lymphoid infiltration) as well as ventricular hypertrophy (Hirota et al. (1995) Continuous activation of gp130, a signal-transducing receptor component for interleukin 6-related cytokines, causes myocardial hypertrophy in mice, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 92:4862-4866). The ventricular hypertrophy is believed to be mediated by a continuous activation of gp130 (Id.). The role of IL-6 is reportedly to help strengthen the cytokine receptor complex and induce dimerization of gp130, which is the signal transducing component responsible for transducing the IL-6 signal (Paonessa et al. (1995) Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp130 dimer formation and signalling, EMBO J. 14(9):1942-1951). The activated complex is believed to be a hexamer composed of two IL-6, each IL-6 bound to one IL-6Rα and two gp130 (each IL-6 contains two independent gp130-binding sites) exhibiting a 2:2:2 stoichiometry, wherein the dimerization of gp130 causes activation of JAK-Tyk tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of gp130 and STAT family transcription factors and other intracellular substrates (Id.; Stahl, N. (1994) Association and Activation of Jak-Tyk Kinases by CNTF-LIF-OSM-IL-6β Receptor Components, Science 263:92-95), consistent with a general model of cytokine receptor complex formation (see, Stahl, N. and Yancopoulos, G. (1993) The Alphas, Betas, and Kinases of Cytokine Receptor Complexes, Cell 74:587-590; Davis et al. (1993) LIFRβ and gp130 as Heterodimerizing Signal Transducers of the Tripartite CNTF Receptor, Science 260:1805-1808; Murakami et al. (1993) IL-6-Induced Homodimerization of gp130 and Associated Activation of a Tyrosine Kinase, Science 2601808-1810). Mice transgenic for human sIL-6R driven by a rat PEP carboxykinase promoter and human IL-6 driven by a mouse metallothionein-1 promoter are reportedly markedly smaller that mice transgenic for human IL-6 alone or human sIL-6R alone (Peters et al. (1997) Extramedullary Expansion of Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells in Interleukin(IL-)-6-sIL-6R Double Transgenic Mice, J. Exp. Med. 185(4):755-766), reflected in reduced body fat and reduced weight (20-25 g vs. 40 g). Double transgenic mice reportedly also exhibit spleen (5-fold) and liver (2-fold) enlargement as compared with reportedly normal organ weights for single transgenic mice, apparently due to extramedullary proliferation of hematopoeitic cells of spleena and liver but not bone marrow, as well as elevated megakaryocytes in spleen and plasmacellular infiltrates in all parenchymal organs (Id.). Double transgenics also exhibit livers with an increase of about 200- to about 300-fold in granulocytes, macrophages, progenitor cells, and B cells as compared with single transgenics; in contrast, IL-6 single transgenic mice exhibited lesser increases in macrophages (15-fold) and B cells (45-fold) (Id.). The extraordinary findings are presumably due to stimulation of growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells by activating gp130 signal transduction (Id.). Further, double transgenic (mouse metallothionine promoter-driven hIL-6/rat PEP carboxykinase promoter-driven hIL-6R) mice exhibit a hepatocellular hyperplasia that is reportedly identical to human nodular regenerative hyperplasia with sustained hepatocyte proliferation that strongly suggests that IL-6 is responsible for both hepatocyte proliferation and pathogenic hepatocellular transformation (Maione et al. (1998) Coexrpession of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R causes nodular regenerative hyperplasia and adenomas of the liver, EMBO J. 17(19):5588-5597). Because hepatocellular hyperplasia is reportedly not observed in single transgenic hIL-6 mice and hIL-6 can bind mIL-6R, the finding may appear paradoxical until it is considered that the double transgenic may result in higher levels of hIL-6 complexed to soluble IL-6R (here, soluble hIL-6R), which complex is a more potent inhibitor that IL-6 alone (Id.). In contrast to mice that are transgenic for human IL-6, humanized IL-6 mice that comprise a replacement at an endogenous mouse IL-6 locus, which retain mouse regulatory elements but comprise a humanization of IL-6-encoding sequence, do not exhibit the severe pathologies of prior art mice. Genetically modified mice that were heterozygous or homozygous for hIL-6 were grossly normal. Mice with a humanized IL-6 gene (MAID 760) as described in the Examples were immunophenotyped and found to have normal B cell numbers in FACS analyses (lymphocyte-gated) of spleen B cells using a pan B cell marker (CD445R(B220)) (FIG. 4). For spleen, wild-type mice exhibited 63% B cells; hIL-6 heterozygote mice exhibited 63% B cells; and mice homozygous for hIL-6 at the endogeous mouse locus exhibited 63% B cells. B cell numbers for homozygous hIL-6 mice immunized with TNP-KLH were also normal (65% for wild-type, and 61% for hIL-6 homozygotes). Splenic T cells were also about the same as wild-type (FIG. 5). Percentages of splenic T cells for Thelper/Tcytoxic were, for wild-type 20%/40% (ratio of 1.4:1); for hIL-6 heterozygotes 23%/14% (ratio of 1.6:1); for hIL-6 homozygotes 21%/15% (ratio of 1.4:1) (markers were CD8a-APC; CD4-FITC). Homozygous hIL-6 mice immunized with TNP-KLH exhibited similar splenic T cell numbers to wild-type mice, i.e., Thelper/Tcytotoxic were 22%/20% (ratio of 1.1:1) as compared with 21%/19% for wild-type (also a ratio of 1.1:1). Humanized IL-6 mice also exhibited about normal levels of splenic NK cells on FACS analysis (CD11b and DX5) (FIG. 7). hIL-6 heterozygotes exhibited 2.2% NK cells, and hIL-6 homozygotes exhibited 1.8% NK cells, whereas wild-type mice exhibited 2.4% NK cells. Following immunization with TNP-KLH, homozygotes exhibited 1.6% splenic NK cells, whereas wild-type mice exhibited 2.1% splenic NK cells. Humanized IL-6 mice also exhibited normal levels of splenic Ly6G/C(Gr1) cells (FIG. 6). hIL-6 heterozygotes exhibited 7.0% GR1+ cells (1.3% Gr1hi); homozygotes exhibited 6.8% Gr1+ cells (0.9% Gr1hi), whereas wild-type mice exhibited 8.0% Gr1+ cells (1.8% Gr1hi). Immunized IL-6 homozygotes (immunized with TNP-KLH) exhibited 11% Gr1+ cells (4.0% Gr1hi), whereas wild-type mice exhibited 10% Gr1+ cells (3.0% Gr1hi). Humanized IL-6 mice also exhibited normal blood B and T cell numbers in FACS analysis (FIG. 8 and FIG. 9). FACs with a pan B cell marker (CD445R(B220)) revealed that homozygous hIL-6 mice exhibited 52% B cell as compared with wild-type 53%; heterozygotes exhibited 38% (an average of two different stainings of 29% and 47%). Homozygous hIL-6 mice immunized with TNP-KLH gave similar B cell numbers (43%, as compared with 45% for wild-type mice). Humanized IL-6 mice exhibited normal blood T cell numbers in FACS analysis as measured by CD8a and CD4 staining. Heterozygous hIL-6 mice exhibited Thelper/Tcytotoxic numbers of 39%/26% (ratio of 1.5:1); homozygous hIL-6 mice exhibited Th/Tc numbers of 24%/20% (ratio of 1.2:1), whereas wild-type mice exhibited Th/Tc numbers of 26%/20% (ratio of 1.3:1). Homozygous hIL-6 mice immunized with TNP-KLH had Th/Tc numbers of 29%/21% (ratio of 1.4:1), whereas wild-type immunized mice had Th/Tc numbers of 28%/23% (1.2:1). Humanized IL-6 mice also exhibited myeloid cell numbers in blood that were similar to wild-type mice as measured by FACS analysis of naïve and immunized mouse blood stained with Ly6G/C(Gr1) and CD11b, as well as CD11b and DX5 (FIG. 10, FIG. 11, and FIG. 12). Heterozygous hIL-6 mice exhibited % Gr+ cells of 10.8%, homozygotes 6.9%, whereas wild-type mice exhibited 9.7%. Immunized hIL-6 homozygotes exhibited M1(Ly6G/C(Gr) of 101-104)/M2(Ly6G/C(Gr) staining of about 102-103) numbers of 43%/34%, whereas wild-type mice had numbers of 45%/38%. FACS plots of CD11b (vertical axis) vs. Ly6G/C (horizontal axis) for immunized homozygous hIL-6 mice showed cell percentage in quadrants (upper left/upper right/lower right) of 16%/8%/3%, which were identical to immunized wild-type quadrant numbers. Homozygous TNP-KLH-immunized humanized IL-6 mice exhibited CD11b vs. DX5(NK) staining FACS plots that were similar to immunized wild-type mice. Quadrant analysis blood FACS plots (CD11b vertical axis, DX5(NK) horizontal axis) revealed upper left/upper right/lower right numbers of 9.5%/17%/10% for hIL-6 homozygotes and 6.5%/17.3%/14% for wild-type mice. Humanized IL-6 mice exhibited an isotype response that was essentially the same as observed in wild-type mice. Early and final IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, IgA, IgE, and IgM levels were about the same as observed in wild-type mice. In one experiment, final IgM was slightly higher in humanized mice; final IgG3 was also elevated in humanized mice. B cell development in naïve hIL-6 mice was essentially indistinguishable from development in wild-type mice based on FACS analysis of bone marrow IgM/CD24/B220 staining (FIG. 13). Immunophenotyping of immune mice revealed that marker populations for various cell types in the B cell development progression were essentially normal in hIL-6 mice. Progression of cells from hematopoietic stem cells, common lymphoid progenitors, ProB cells, PreB cells, and immature and mature B cells is normal in hIL-6 mice (FIG. 14 and FIG. 15) EXAMPLES Example 1 Replacement of Endogenous Mouse IL-6 Gene with hIL-6 Gene The 4.8-kb human IL-6 gene containing exons 1 through 5 of the human IL-6 gene replaced 6.8 kb of the murine IL-6 gene locus. A targeting construct for replacing the mouse with the human IL-6 gene in a single targeting step was constructed using VELOCIGENE® genetic engineering technology (see, Valenzuela et al. (2003) High-throughput engineering of the mouse genome coupled with high-resolution expression analysis, Nature Biotech, 21(6):652-659). Mouse and human IL-6 DNA were obtained from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) RPCI-23 clone 368C3, and from BAC CTD clone 2369M23, respectively. Briefly, a NotI linearized targeting construct generated by gap repair cloning containing mouse IL-6 upstream and downstream homology arms flanking a 4.8 kb human IL-6 sequence extending from ATG in exon 1 to exon 5 with 16 nucleotides of 3′ downstream sequence (genomic coordinates: NCBIh37.1: ch7:22,766,882 to 22,771,637) and a floxed neo selection cassette, was electroporated into F1H4 mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (C57BL/6×129 F1 hybrid). Correctly targeted ES cells (MAID 790) were further electroporated with a transient Cre-expressing vector to remove the drug selection cassette. Targeted ES cell clones without drug cassette (MAID 1428) were introduced into an 8-cell stage mouse embryo by the VELOCIMOUSE® method (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,294,754, 7,576,259, 7,659,442, and Poueymirou et al. (2007) F0 generation mice that are essentially fully derived from the donor gene-targeted ES cells allowing immediate phenotypic analyses Nature Biotech. 25(1):91-99). VELOCIMICE® (F0 mice fully derived from the donor ES cell) bearing the humanized IL-6 gene were identified by genotyping for loss of mouse allele and gain of human allele using a modification of allele assay (see, Valenzuela et al. (2003)). Correctly targeted ES cell clones were identified by a loss-of-native-allele (LONA) assay (Valenzuela et al. 2003) in which the number of copies of the native, unmodified II6 gene were determined by two TaqMan™ quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) specific for sequences in the mouse II6 gene that were targeted for deletion. The qPCR assays comprised the following primer-probe sets (written 5′ to 3′): upstream forward primer, TTGCCGGTTT TCCCTTTTCT C (SEQ ID NO:1); upstream reverse primer, AGGGAAGGCC GTGGTTGTC (SEQ ID NO:2); upstream probe, FAM-CCAGCATCAG TCCCAAGAAG GCAACT-BHQ (SEQ ID NO:3); downstream forward primer, TCAGAGTGTG GGCGAACAAA G (SEQ ID NO:4); downstream reverse primer, GTGGCAAAAG CAGCCTTAGC (SEQ ID NO:5); downstream probe, FAM-TCATTCCAGG CCCTTCTTAT TGCATCTG-BHQ (SEQ ID NO:6); in which FAM refers to the 5-carboxyfluorescein fluorescent probe and BHQ refers to the fluorescence quencher of the black hole quencher type (Biosearch Technologies). DNA purified from ES cell clones that that have taken up the targeting vector and incorporated in their genomes was combined with TaqMan™ Gene Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's suggestions in a 384-well PCR plate (MicroAmp™ Optical 384-Well Reaction Plate, Life Technologies) and cycled in an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT, which collects fluorescence data during the course of the PCRs and determines a threshold cycle (Ct), the fractional PCR cycle at which the accumulated fluorescence reaches a pre-set threshold. The upstream and downstream II6-specific qPCRs and two qPCRs for non-targeted reference genes were run for each DNA sample. The differences in the Ct values (ΔCt) between each II6-specific qPCR and each reference gene qPCR were calculated, and then the difference between each ΔCt and the median ΔCt for all samples assayed was calculated to obtain ΔΔCt values for each sample. The copy number of the II6 gene in each sample was calculated from the following formula: copy number=2·2−ΔΔCt. A correctly targeted clone, having lost one of its native copies, will has an II6 gene copy number equal to one. Confirmation that the human IL6 gene sequence replaced the deleted mouse II6 gene sequence in the humanized allele was confirmed by a TaqMan™ qPCR assay that comprises the following primer-probe sets (written 5′ to 3′): the human forward primer, CCCCACTCCACTGGAATTTG (SEQ ID NO:7); the human reverse primer, GTTCAACCACAGCCAGGAAAG (SEQ ID NO:8); and the human probe, FAM-AGCTACAACTCATTGGCATCCTGGCAA-BHQ (SEQ ID NO:9). The same LONA assay was used to assay DNA purified from tail biopsies for mice derived from the targeted ES cells to determine their II6 genotypes and confirm that the humanized II6 allele had transmitted through the germline. Two pups heterozygous for the replacement are bred to generate a mouse that is homozygous for the replacement of the endogenous mouse IL-6 gene by the human IL-6 gene.

Example 2 Immunophenotyping of Naive and Immunized hIL-6 Mice: B Cells Mice homozygous for the hIL-6 gene replacement were analyzed for B cells (DC445R(B220). Lymphocyte-gated fractions from spleen cell preparations of naive and immunized (TNP-KLH) hIL-6 mice were stained and immunophenotyped using flow cytometry. FACS analysis showed that the percentage of B cells of the spleen cell preparation as measured by CD45R(B220)-FITC staining were about the same (63% of cells) for preparations from naive wild-type, hIL-6 heterozygotes, and hIL-6 homozygotes. For immunized mice, B cells accounted for about 65% of total cells of the spleen cell preparation in wild-type mice, and about 61% of total cells in hIL-6 homozygotes. Spleens of hIL-6 mice (both naive and immunized) contain a population of B cells that is about the same size as the splenic B cell population in wild-type mice. Bone marrow of wild-type, hIL-6 heterozygotes, and hIL-6 homozygotes was stained with B cell markers (CD45R(B220)-APC, CD24(HSA)-PE, or CD43 conjugated to a dye and/or IgM (IgM-FITC). B cell development in bone marrow of normal mice will be reflected in surface markers as cells progress from stem cells to early pro-B cells to late pro-B cells, to large pre-B cells to small pre-B cells to immature B cells and finally, to mature B cells. Common lymphocyte progenitor pro-B cells will express CD45R, and in later stages will express IgM as immature and later as mature B cells. Thus, CD45R-stained and anti-IgM-stained B cells should reveal a pattern characteristic of B cell development. Bone marrow of hIL-6 heterozygotes and homozygotes displayed a pattern of CD45R(B220)-APC and anti-IgM-FITC staining that was essentially indistinguishable from wild-type bone marrow, showing populations of B cells that stained positive for CD45R(B220) and IgM, or CD45R(B220) alone. B cell sub-populations in bone marrow of hIL-6 mice revealed by FACS staining were similar to those in wild-type mice (Table 1; see also, FIG. 13).

Example 3 Replacement of Endogenous Mouse IL-6Rα Ectodomain Gene Sequence with hIL-6Rα Ectodomain Gene Sequence The 45 kb human IL-6Rα gene containing exons 1 through 8 of the human IL-6Rα gene replaced 35.4 kb of the murine IL-6Rα gene locus. Mouse exons 9 and 10 were retained; only exons 1-8 were humanized. In total, 35,384 nt of mouse sequence was replaced by 45,047 nt of human sequence. A targeting construct for replacing the mouse with the human IL-6Rα gene in a single targeting step was constructed using VELOCIGENE® genetic engineering technology (see, Valenzuela et al. (2003) High-throughput engineering of the mouse genome coupled with high-resolution expression analysis, Nature Biotech, 21(6):652-659). Mouse and human IL-6Rα DNA were obtained from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) RPCI-23 clone 125J8, and from BAC CTD clone 2192J23, respectively. Briefly, a NotI linearized targeting construct generated by gap repair cloning containing mouse IL-6Rα upstream and downstream homology arms flanking a 45 kb human IL-6Rα sequence extending from ATG in exon 1 to exon 8 with 69 nucleotides of 3′ downstream sequence and a floxed neo selection cassette, was electroporated into F1H4 mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (C57BL/6×129 F1 hybrid). Correctly targeted ES cells (MAID 794) were further electroporated with a transient Cre-expressing vector to remove the drug selection cassette. Targeted ES cell clones without drug cassette (MAID 1442) were introduced into an 8-cell stage mouse embryo by the VELOCIMOUSE® method (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,294,754, 7,576,259, 7,659,442, and Poueymirou et al. (2007) F0 generation mice that are essentially fully derived from the donor gene-targeted ES cells allowing immediate phenotypic analyses Nature Biotech. 25(1):91-99). VELOCIMICE® (F0 mice fully derived from the donor ES cell) bearing the humanized IL-6Rα gene were identified by genotyping for loss of mouse allele and gain of human allele using a modification of allele assay (see, Valenzuela et al. (2003)). Correctly targeted ES cell clones were identified by a loss-of-native-allele (LONA) assay (Valenzuela et al. 2003) in which the number of copies of the native, unmodified II6 gene were determined by two TaqMan™ quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) specific for sequences in the mouse II6 gene that were targeted for deletion. The qPCR assays comprised the following primer-probe sets (written 5′ to 3′): upstream forward primer, GCCCTAGCAT GCAGAATGC (SEQ ID NO:13); upstream reverse primer, AAGAGGTCCC ACATCCTTTG C (SEQ ID NO:14); upstream probe, CCCACATCCA TCCCAATCCT GTGAG (SEQ ID NO:15); downstream forward primer, GAGCTTGCCC CCAGAAAGG (SEQ ID NO:16); downstream reverse primer, CGGCCACATC TCTGGAAGAC (SEQ ID NO:17); downstream probe, CATGCACTGC CCCAAGTCTG GTTTCAGT (SEQ ID NO:18). DNA purified from ES cell clones that that have taken up the targeting vector and incorporated in their genomes was combined with TaqMan™ Gene Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's suggestions in a 384-well PCR plate (MicroAmp™ Optical 384-Well Reaction Plate, Life Technologies) and cycled in an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT, which collects fluorescence data during the course of the PCRs and determines a threshold cycle (Ct), the fractional PCR cycle at which the accumulated fluorescence reaches a pre-set threshold. The upstream and downstream IL-6Rα-specific qPCRs and two qPCRs for non-targeted reference genes were run for each DNA sample. The differences in the Ct values (ΔCt) between each IL-6Rα-specific qPCR and each reference gene qPCR were calculated, and then the difference between each ΔCt and the median ΔCt for all samples assayed was calculated to obtain ΔΔCt values for each sample. The copy number of the II6 gene in each sample was calculated from the following formula: copy number=2·2−ΔΔCt. A correctly targeted clone, having lost one of its native copies, will have an IL-6Rα gene copy number equal to one. Confirmation that the human IL-6Rα gene sequence replaced the deleted mouse IL-6Rα gene sequence in the humanized allele was confirmed by a TaqMan™ qPCR assay that comprises the following primer-probe sets (written 5′ to 3′): the human forward primer, GGAGAGGGCA GAGGCACTTA C (SEQ ID NO:19); the human reverse primer, GGCCAGAGCC CAAGAAAAG (SEQ ID NO:20); and the human probe, CCCGTTGACT GTAATCTGCC CCTGG (SEQ ID NO:21). The same LONA assay was used to assay DNA purified from tail biopsies for mice derived from the targeted ES cells to determine their IL-6Rα genotypes and confirm that the humanized IL-6Rα allele had transmitted through the germline. Pups heterozygous for the replacement are bred to generate a mouse that is homozygous for the replacement of the endogenous mouse IL-6Rα gene by the human IL-6Rα (ectodomain) gene. Pups that are homozygous for the replacement are used for phenotyping.
