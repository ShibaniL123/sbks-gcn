BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a nail lamp device, and particularly to a nail lamp device using a chip on board (COB) light emitting diode (LED) module as a light source. 2. Description of the Prior Art Beauty is human nature. As people pay more attention on appearance, people usually put resin coatings with different colors on nails to increase the gloss and color of nails, or use various decorative pieces adhered on nails to enhance the richness of Manicure design. To let resin coatings or glues coated on nails be cured fast, a nail lamp device is used to irradiate the resin coatings or glues, so as to accelerate the curing reaction of the resin coatings or glues. FIG. 1 shows a partial structural schematic view of a conventional nail lamp device. As shown in FIG. 1, a plurality of openings 12 are formed in an inner housing 10 of a conventional nail lamp device, and a plurality sets of light source modules 14 are disposed on an outer top 101 and an outer side 102 of the inner housing 10. Light produced by light sources 141 of the light source modules 14 is projected into an inner chamber 16 of the inner housing 10 via the openings 12. To let heat produced by the light sources 141 of the light source modules 14 be able to be dissipated efficiently, there is a need to dispose heat-dissipating pieces 18 or heat-dissipating fins. Such a design, which is needed to dispose heat-dissipating pieces or heat-dissipating fins additionally, tends to result in a heavy and inconvenient nail lamp device. Besides, the light source 141 used conventionally is a single lamp. A single lamp produces light with a narrow angle and low power, which usually extends the time required for the curing reaction of the resin coatings or glues, so that time is wasted. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION To solve the above-mentioned problems, one objective of the present invention is to provide a nail lamp device, which has a chip on board (COB) light emitting diode (LED) module directly disposed on an inner surface of an inner housing substrate by pasting-fitted, such that a plurality of LED elements emit light toward an inner chamber. Heat produced by the LED elements may be directly dissipated to outside via a heat-conductive substrate structure and the inner housing substrate. Thus, the present invention has the advantage of lightness and convenience. One objective of the present invention is to provide a nail lamp device, which uses a COB LED module having a plurality of LED elements arranged in array to emit light with high power, so that a nail lamp device of the present invention can accelerate the time required for the curing reaction of the resin coatings or glues coated on fingers, thus meeting requirements of consumers. One objective of the present invention is to provide a nail lamp device, which uses a COB LED module having LED elements with different wavelength ranges of light. Based on a sort of the resin coatings coated by a user, the LED elements with the needed wavelength ranges of light are driven to emit light by a control module, thereby irradiating the resin coatings and curing the resin coatings quickly. The present invention has the advantage that wavelength ranges of light can be selected with high elasticity, so as to enhance utility. To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, a nail lamp device of one embodiment of the present invention comprises: an inner housing comprising an inner housing substrate and an inner chamber surrounded by the inner housing substrate, the inner chamber comprising at least one front opening, the inner housing substrate comprising an inner surface and an opposed outer surface, and the inner surface facing the inner chamber; at least one COB LED module, each of the COB LED modules comprising: a heat-conductive substrate structure having a front side and a back side, the back side being disposed on the inner surface of the inner housing substrate by pasting-fitted; and a plurality of LED elements electrically connected to the front side of the heat-conductive substrate structure and emitting light toward the inner chamber; a control module disposed on the outer surface of the inner housing substrate and electrically connected to the COB LED module, so as to control the COB LED module; and an outer housing covering the inner housing and retaining the front opening of the inner chamber exposed.

Continuing to refer to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, the control module 26 is disposed on the outer surface 302 of the inner housing substrate 30.

After resin coatings or glues are coated on nails 48 by a user, as shown in FIG. 6, the user only needs to put fingers 50 into the inner chamber 32 through the front opening 321, and drive the COB LED modules 24 to emit light by an exposed control switch (not shown) of the control module 26 (as shown in FIG. 5), and the resin coatings or glues on the fingers 50 may be cured quickly. Moreover, in the present invention, the plurality of LED elements 40 of each of the COB LED modules 24 may be selected to have a same wavelength range of light, or have many different′ wavelength ranges of light. A selection of the wavelength ranges of light may depend on a sort of a resin coating or a glue selected to be used on nails. In one embodiment, the plurality of LED elements 40 of a single COB LED module 24 may be selected to have two wavelength ranges of light. One wavelength range is between 390 nanometer and 410 nanometer, and the other wavelength range is between 320 nanometer and 390 nanometer. On the other hand, if the plurality of LED elements 40 of a single COB LED module 24 all use a same wavelength range of light, a plurality sets of the COB LED modules 24 having different wavelength ranges of light may be selected to be distributed on the inner surface 301 (as shown in FIG. 3) of the inner housing substrate 30 (as shown in FIG. 3). In one embodiment, a plurality sets of single COB LED module 24 may be selected to have two wavelength ranges of light. One wavelength range is between 390 nanometer and 410 nanometer, and the other wavelength range is between 320 nanometer and 390 nanometer. In yet one embodiment, each of the COB LED modules may further includes a reflective cup secured on the heat-conductive substrate structure and facing the inner chamber, and the reflective cup is disposed around the LED elements to enhance a strength of the light of the LED elements in a front direction. In the present invention, each of the COB LED modules is directly disposed on the inner surface of the inner housing substrate by pasting-fitted, such that a plurality of LED elements emit light toward the inner chamber. Heat produced by the LED elements may be directly dissipated to outside via the heat-conductive substrate structure and the inner housing substrate. Such a design uses the inner housing substrate to provide a reflective property and a heat-dissipating function, eliminating a need of a conventional nail lamp device to dispose heat-dissipating pieces or heat-dissipating fins, so that the present invention has the advantage of lightness and convenience. Furthermore, since each set of the COB LED modules has a plurality of LED elements arranged in array to emit light with high power, a nail lamp device of the present invention can accelerate the time required for the curing reaction of the resin coatings or glues coated on fingers, thus meeting requirements of consumers. Besides, in the present invention, since the COB LED module has LED elements with different wavelength ranges of light, based on a sort of the resin coating coated by a user, the LED elements with the needed wavelength ranges of light are driven to emit light by a control module, thereby irradiating the resin coating and curing the resin coating quickly. Thus, the present invention also has the advantage that the wavelength ranges of light can be selected with high elasticity, so as to enhance utility.
