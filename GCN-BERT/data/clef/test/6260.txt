Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms. [0172( As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug comb ination, the severity and course of the disease, and the patient’s disposition to the disease and the judgment of the treating physician, [0!73| Depending upon the particular condition, or disease, to be treated or prevented, additional therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to treat or prevent that condition, may also be present in the compositions of this invention.

In order to permit, a study of the efficacy of the BLMdisaccharide as a tumor targeting vehicle for cytotoxic agents, ΑΡΑ (4-aniino-4-deoxy-IO-AMnethylpterok acid) was conjugated to the RLM-dlsaccharide (Scheme 1). 2,4-Diairiiiio-6-(hydroxymetliyl)pteridine hydrochloride (1) was treated with triphenylphosphme dibromide to generate the alkyl bromide m situ: this was coupled with 4-N-methyIarninobenz.oic acid to obtain ΑΡΑ (2) in 56% yield. Compound 3 was condensed with ΑΡΑ to provide the APA-BLMdisaecharide conjugate 4 in 37% yield. Conjugate 5 was designed to be a tumor selective drug delivery vehicle. Once inside the cell, the cellular esterases should release the cytotoxic drug, in this case ΑΡΑ, from the conjugate.
