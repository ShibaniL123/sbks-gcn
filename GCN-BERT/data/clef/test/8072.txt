Example 5
To a suspension of N-(4-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)phenyl)benzamide (0.041 g, 0.138 mmol) and 2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.024 g, 0.152 mmol), and pyridine (0.01 mL, 0.623 mmol) in acetonitrile (1.5 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.29 mL, 0.485 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 48.5° C. for 4 days. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (10 mL) and extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (2×25 mL) followed by washing once with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by precipitating in dichloromethane and filtration to give N-(4-(4-benzamidophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)-2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxamide (0.029 g, 48%) as a beige solid.
