S410 This invention relates to the art of increasing the corrosion resistance of steel, zinc or alloys thereof in which zinc is the principal or predominant ingredient and aluminium or alloys thereof in which aluminum is the principal or predominant ingredient. In the following disclosure it will be understood that alleys of either zinc or aluminum are intended to be included where reference is made to either zinc or aluminum. In many present day industries steel, zinc and aluminum are more and more frequently encountered either severally, that is, one after the other, in various manufacturing or finishing procedures or collectively in various assemblies consisting of any two of them or of ai1 three together. Furthermore, all of these metals are more and more frequently subjected to treatments for increasing their corrosion resistance. Typical of such treatments are various phosphate coating processes by means of which a crystalline phosphate coating is chemically bonded to the surface as a result of treatment with an acidic solution. Some of these processes are capable of producing crystalline phosphate coatings on either steel or zinc surfaces without alteration of their chemical constituents while some of them are designed primarily for the treatment of steel alone and s till others for zinc alone. Similarly, in the case of aluminum, the art at present is familiar with !iii: 7, various solutions in which fluorides are incorporated by mean of which crystalline phosphate coatings can be applied to aluminum surfaces as well as to zinc or steel. With the foregoing in mind, it is obvious that it would be highly desirable to provide a treating technique for the metals mentioned by means of which the surface of any one of these metals or of any combihation of them at the same time can be successfully improved as to ultimate corrosion resistance by treatment in the same baths and by means of the same technique so that it never becomes necessary to install more than one system for the handling of all of these metals taken either singly or in combination and it is the principal object of our invention to proNièe such a single integrated process for the treatment of these metals by means of which their corrosion resistance can be markedly improved and their utility enhanced. Our improved process includes two principal steps, the first being a step which employs an acidic phosphate coating solution which is designed for the production of a phosphate coating on either steel or zinc. The second step involves the use of an acidulated solution of chromic acid and a fluorine bearing compound in accordance with the disclosure to follow. The combìnation of these two steps impart excellent corrosion resistance to aluminum as well as to the steel or the zinc. 3. ï I • fi41079 The present invention is based upon the discovery that when steel, zinc and aluminum surfaces which have been subjected to the action of an acid aqueous phosphatizing solution of a type which will produce a crystalline phosphate coating on either steel or zinc, are subsequently treated with an acidulated solution of chromic acid and a fluorìne bearing compound, as will further appear, the corrosion resistance of a so-treated aluminum surface or a so-treated zinc surface will be considerably enhanced in comparison with prior art procedures and, further, that a steel surface when so treated will be protected at least as well as it would be had it been treated strictly in accordance with the practices of the prior art. Furthermore, this is true whether or not the aluminum surface acquìres a crystalline phosphate coating from the initial treatment. Furthermore, the treatment of the present invention produces surfaces which are unusually well adapted to receive a final siccative coating of paint, lacquer, japan or the like. By the term "fluorine bearing compound" in the foregoing statement we mean complex fluoride such as fluosilicic acid, fluoboric acid, fluozirconic acid, fluostannic acid, fluotitanic acid and the soluble salts of any one of them« In carrying out the process of our invention, as previously indicated, the metal surface is first subjected to the action of a phosphate coating solution which is capable of producing a crystalline phosphate coating on eìther steel ï I< iii !!/i or zinc. Such solutions are now so well known to the art that it is not necessary to cite specific examples. arthermore, we have found that any such solution known to the art is useful in the process of the present invention. As purely illustrative but in no way limiting, reference may be had to the phosphate coating solutions described in the following U. S. patents: 1,911,726 2,121,574 2,132,883 2,312,855, 2,316,811 2,326,309 In addition the c9Pending application of George Schneider, Serial No. 7, assigned tó the assignee of the present application, also discloses a type of phosphate coating solution which is useful for the purposes of the present invention After the metal has been subjected to the aCtion of such a solution it is generally desirable to rinse the surface of the treated metal with water immediately prior to subjecting it to a second treating solution according to the present invention, which solution will now be described in detail. 5.4,1 0 7 ! The amount of chromic acid and fluorine bearing compound present in the solution is important. The chromic acid concentration should be between 0.30 and lO grams per liter and preferably between O@4 and 3.0 grams per liter. At a chromic acid concentration of less than 0.30 gram per liter, very little enhanced corrosion resistance is obtained. At concentrations of chromic acid greater than 10 grams per liter, any crystalline phosphate coatìng is apt to be at least partially stripped from the metallic surface. At concentrations between 0.4 and 3.0 grams per líter of chromic acid, maximum corrosion resistance is achieved with minimum tendency of any subsequently applied siccative coatìng to blister. The fluorine content of the bath should be between O.10 and lO grams per liter, preferably between O.1 and 1.5 per liter. At concentrations of less than O.10 grams liter, there is a marked falling off in the effect proby the solution. At fluorine concentrations of greater than 10 grams per liter, there is a marked tendency to strip any phosphate coating and also to attack the surface of aluminum in a deleterious fashion. For optimum results the fluorine concentration should be between 0.I and 1.5 grams per lite The pH of the treating solution is also important. The chromic acid and fluorine bearing compounds must be present 541079 ï !!ii• in the solution in proportions and amounts so that the pH of the solution is from 1.3 to 4.0. At pH's below 1.3, there is a tendency for any phosphate coating previously formed te be stripped from the metallic surface and at a pH greater than 4.0 very little enhanced corrosion resistance is imparted to the treated surface. For optimum results, the pH should lie between 1.8 and 3o0. While treating baths made up within the allowable limits indicated will yield excellent and highly useful results, we should llke to point out that for best results, within the preferred limits previously specified, the follow ing "rule of thumb" method of preparing the treating baths has proven very useful, i.e., when the concentration of chromic acid is low, the concentration of fluorine bearing cempound should also be relatively low and, conversely, when theoconcentratlon of chromic acid is high, the concentration of fluorinebearing compound should alsobe relatively high° Within the teachings just given, suitable treating solutions for this second principal step may be prepared in accordance with the following formulas: Formula No. i K2TiF6.H20 2.3 grams CrO3 4 grams Water, to make 1 liter • rr • • i ï !il r Formula No. 2 ( NH4)2 ZrF i. 1 grams CrO 2 grams Water, to make 1 liter Formula No. NaBF 2.16 grams CrO3 8 grams Water, to make 1 liter The second treating step is effected by subjecting the surface of the metal which has already been treated with the first step to a solution of the character just described and of which typical examples are given in Formulas 1 te 3. The length of treating time should be of such duration that the entire surface of the metal is thoroughly wetted with the treating solution. Once this wetting has taken place, the treated surface may then be dried and painted if desired The treating solutions of this step are useful over a wide range of temperature. In general, for concentrated treating solutìons we prefer relatively low temperatures while for dilute treating solutìons we prefer relative ly high temperatures, i.e., 150°F. and over. However, we Se iy • H ' i /I i/ t t are not limited to any specific range of temperature. ! l If desíred, the second treating step may be f0110 w-I ed by a water rínse and/or a dilute acidulated rinse of any type which is conventional in this art. Naturally, drying of the treated and rinsed surface is usual where a siccative coating is to b e subsequently applíed. In conjunction with the above given examples and disclosures, it should be noted that as a source of fluorine we prefer to use soluble fluorides of zirconium and titanium. The reason for this is that treating baths prepared from thes materials are immediately ready for use upon preparation of the bath. If the source of fluorìne is a borofluoride, fluosilícate, etc., usually for optimum results, it is desirable to allow the baths to "age" for several hours before use. Additionally, it should be pointed out that articles, after they have been subjected to the action of a phosphatizing solution, should usually be given a water rinse prior to their final treatment. By doing thís, the pH of the final treatment bath may be maintained within their optimumph range for a longer period of time than would otherwise be the case and, additionally, adverse effects by any foreign contaminants would be minimized. 9. i !i rI i " »1 ii i .... iI Rí41079 The embodìments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: i.
