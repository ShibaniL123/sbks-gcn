Preparation of (R)-1-(3-bromo-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-amine
n-BuLi (26.1 mL, 41.8 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 1,3-dibromo-2-methylbenzene (9.95 g, 39.8 mmol) in THF (100 mL) at −78° C. After stirring for 30 minutes, (R)-tert-butyl 4-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazolidine-3-carboxylate 2,2-dioxide (10.39 g, 43.8 mmol) was added in portions and the reaction was stirred for a further 30 minutes before being allowed to warm to 0° C. over 30 minutes. 1N citric acid was added and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes before it was extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organic phases were evaporated. The residue was stirred in 4M HCl in dioxane (69.7 mL, 278.7 mmol) at room temperature for 1 hour, then the volatiles were evaporated. The residue was suspended in diethyl ether, and extracted with water (×2). The combined aqueous phases were basified by addition of 2N Na2CO3, then extracted with DCM (×3). The combined organics phases were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated to afford (R)-1-(3-bromo-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-amine (7.55 g, 83%) as a yellow oil.
