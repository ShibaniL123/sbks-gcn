A SHARED ARMREST FIELD [0001 ] The invention relates to a shared armrest. In particular, the invention relates to a shared armrest which provides separate armrest members for each person sharing the armrest. BACKGROUND [0002] It is well known that passengers experience discomfort in multiple seat arrangements where a single central armrest is shared by two persons. Sharing the central armrest can lead to dispute and discontent. The problem is particularly acute in the economy section of a passenger aircraft. Economy seating seeks to maximise the number of seats in a given area, thus shared armrests are necessarily very narrow. [0003] Typically, where a single shared armrest is provided between two seats, only one person is able to use the armrest at any given time. Known single shared armrests used in economy-type seating have limited surface area for supporting an arm due to being narrow. [0004] US 7,959,231 to Lee attempts to solve the problem by providing a shared armrest having two support surfaces which are spaced one above the other in the same horizontal plane. Figure 1 of the drawings shows a front view of the stacked support surface armrest of Lee, in use. One of the drawbacks of the stacked support surface armrest of Lee is that the upper arms of the persons sharing the armrest need to overlap for effective use of the armrest. One person may thus be required to have his/her torso slightly forward and the other to have his/her torso slightly back so that their upper arms can overlap in order to have their forearms comfortably placed one above the other on the two vertically spaced armrest surfaces. This arrangement may be uncomfortable for the passengers. Another possible drawback is that the person resting his/her arm on the lower support surface may not be able to have his/her forearm supported centrally. In some embodiments the stacked support surface armrest of Lee has a leg or web extending from the lateral edge of the lower support surface to the lateral edge of the upper support surface. The leg or web may interfere with a central position of the forearm on the lower support surface. SUMMARY [0005] Various exemplary embodiments of a shared armrest, as described in this specification, can serve to address or ameliorate the problems and issues described in the above background. [0006] Various exemplary embodiments of a shared armrest include two armrest members which are each configured for supporting a person's arm, wherein the shared armrest is configured so that at least one of the armrest members is displaceable between: an undivided condition wherein the armrest members are substantially together; and a split condition wherein the armrest members diverge relative to each other with respective distal ends of the armrest members spaced apart from each other. [0007] The armrest members may be pivotally connected relative to each other by being pivotally connected to a support structure or to each other. In one embodiment, the shared armrest may include a support structure in the form of a hinge body. Proximal ends of the armrest members may be connected in a swivel manner to the hinge body. The armrest members may pivot or swivel about a shared pivot axis. [0008] The hinge body may include knuckles and the proximal ends of the armrest members may also include knuckles. The knuckles of the armrest members may be interleaved with the knuckles of the hinge body to provide a joint assembly in which vertical movement of the armrest members is inhibited. The knuckles having arcuate recesses in which a stop formation is received to limit the range of pivoting of the armrest members. [0009] The hinge body may be connectable to a seat or a frame in a hinged manner to provide hinged displacement of the armrest members in a plane transverse to the plane in which the armrest members swivel relative to each other. [0010] The armrest members may have raised or enlarged distal ends which abut each other in the undivided condition to provide a gap between the armrest members. The gap allows a person to grip an armrest member to swing the armrest member to the split condition. [001 1 ] The armrest members may include flap portions which are operable to flap open to increase the surface area for supporting the person's arm. [0012] The range of pivoting of the armrest member may be limited. In one example the range of pivoting of each armrest member is between 25째 and 45째 from the centred position in the undivided condition. [0013] Exemplary embodiments of a row of seats include the shared armrest between adjacent seats as described hereinabove. The row of seats may include row terminating armrests which are operable to swing inwardly toward seatbacks of the row terminating seats.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS [0038] In the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally indicates one embodiment of a shared armrest. The shared armrest 10 is secured between the seatbacks 25 of two seats 26. [0039] The shared armrest 10 comprises two armrest members 12, 14 pivotally connected to a hinge body 16. The armrest members 12, 14 have distal ends 18 remote from the hinge body 16 and proximal ends 20 where the armrest members 12, 14 connect the hinge body 16. [0040] The armrest members 12, 14 can be pivotally displaced or swivelled between an undivided condition shown in figures 2, 4, 6 and a scissored open or split condition shown in figures 3, 5, 7 and 8. Figures 2, 4, and 6 show only one of the armrest members 14 swivelled towards the seatback 25 into the split condition. Figure 7 shows both armrest members 12, 14 swivelled open towards the respective seatbacks 25. Figure 8 shows the common swivel axis 28 about which the armrest members 12, 14 hinge or pivot from the hinge body 16. [0041 ] The armrest members 12, 14 are elongate having a longitudinal axis 27 extending from the proximal ends 20 to their distal ends 18. [0042] In the undivided condition, the two armrest members 12, 14 are substantially together in a side-by-side arrangement with their respective longitudinal axes 27 substantially parallel. The armrest members 12, 14 extend substantially parallel to each other in the undivided condition in a direction parallel to a centreline 29 between the seats 26. [0043] Each armrest member 12, 14 can be pivoted or swivelled in a direction away from the centreline 29 towards the seatback 25 closest to the respective armrest member 12, 14. The range of pivoting is limited to not exceed between 25째 and 45째, for example, with respect to the centreline 29. The armrest members 12, 14 diverge relative to each other to define an angle between them in the split condition. Only one of the armrest members 12, 14 may be angled out or diverge from the centreline 29 in the split condition of the shared armrest 10. In the split condition the distal ends 18 of the armrest members 12, 14 are spaced apart and the armrest members 12, 14 diverge so as to be angled relative to each other. [0044] The hinge body 16 can be rotated about an axis 32 when lifting or lowering the armrest members 12, 14 to move them between stowed and deployed positions. Figure 9 shows the shared armrest 10 in a deployed position. Figure 10 shows the shared armrest 10 pivoted halfway between the stowed and deployed positions. [0045] The armrest members 12, 14 swivel sideways from the hinge body 16 between the undivided and split conditions in a generally horizontal plane when the shared armrest 10 is in the deployed position. The hinge body 16 allows pivoting of the armrest members 12, 14 upwardly or downwardly in a generally vertical plane. The plane in which the hinge body 16 pivots the armrest members 12, 14 between the stowed and deployed positions is transverse to the plane in which the armrest members 12, 14 hinge or pivot from the hinge body 16. The axis 32 about which the hinge body 16 pivots is square relative to the swivel axis 28 of the armrest members 12, 14. [0046] Figure 1 1 is an exploded view showing the different parts of the shared armrest 10. [0047] The armrest members 12, 14 each comprise an arm 30 having disc-shaped knuckles 34 at the proximal end 20. The knuckles 34 have a central hole 31 for receiving a hinge pin 33. The knuckles 34 have arcuate or radiused end slots or recesses 35. The radiused end slots 35 are arcuate, peripheral recesses along the rearward ends of the knuckles 34. The arm is between 200mm and 350mm long, for example 272mm, measured from the centre of the hole 32 to the distal end 18. [0048] The distal end 18 of the arm 30 has an enlarged end formation 36 which stands proud or is raised from a flat inwardly facing side 38 of the arm 30. The end formations 36 abut each other in the undivided condition of the armrest members 12, 14, keeping the inwardly facing sides 38 spaced slightly apart. The spacing between the inwardly facing sides 38 provides a gap 39 (shown in figure 4) between the sides 38 which is sufficient to allow a user to grip one of the armrest members 12, 14 to swing the armrest member 12, 14 out of the undivided condition. The gap 39 also reduces the likelihood of a pinch point or pinching when closing the armrest members 12, 14. The narrow part of the arm 30 is, for example, between 10 and 30 mm wide. [0049] The armrest members 12, 14 include flap extensions 40. The flap extensions 40 are hingedly connected to the arms 30 by connecting blocks 42. The connecting blocks 42 are pivotally connected to the arms 30 and the flap extensions 40 by pins 44. The flap extensions 40 are folded on top of the arms 30 in the undivided condition. The flap extensions 40 can then be unfolded in the split condition to provide a wider surface area for supporting a passenger's forearm. The flap extensions 40 may also be unfolded in the undivided condition. The flap extensions are, for example, between 10 and 30 mm wide. [0050] The flap extensions 40 are hingedly connected to the arm 30 along an outer edge 41 of the arm 30. Lateral sides of the flap extensions 40 bear against the outside of the arms 30 in the folded open condition to support the flap extensions 40 folded open. In the folded open condition the upwardly facing surface of the flap extension 40 is flush with the upwardly facing surface of the arm 30 to provide a generally continuous surface for supporting a person's arm. [0051 ] The hinge body 16 defines gaps 50, between knuckles 52, in which the knuckles 34 of the armrest members 12, 14 are received. The knuckles 52 each have a central hole 54. The hinge pin 33 extends through the holes 54 in the knuckles 52 to capture the knuckles 34 of the armrest members 12, 14 received in the gaps 50 the hinge body 16. The knuckles 34 are thus interleaved with the knuckles 54 to provide a joint assembly in which vertical movement is inhibited. [0052] The hinge body 16 includes circlips 56 at opposite ends of the hinge pin 33 to lock the hinge pin 33 in place. The hinge body 16 includes a top plate 58 received in a hollow of the topmost knuckle 52 to hide the hinge pin 33. [0053] The hinge body 16 includes a stop formation in the form of a vertical stop pin 60. The stop pin 60 extends through gaps 50 to be located in the radius end slots 35 of the knuckles 34. Ends of the radiused recesses 35 butt against the stop pin 60, in use, to limit the range of swivelling of the armrest members 12, 14. [0054] The hinge body 16 includes a horizontal stop pin 62. The stop pin 62 may abut a stop formation to limit downward travel of the shared armrest 10 in the vertical plane. The stop pin 62 may also be captured by a latch (not shown). [0055] The hinge body 16 is supported relative to the seat in a pivotal manner by a bracket fixed to the seat or a frame of the row of seats. The hinge body 16 is hingedly mounted to the bracket. The hinge body 16 includes two spaced apart horizontally orientated disc formations 63 between which the bracket is seated to support the hinge body 16. [0056] The shared armrest 10 includes a cover 64 which fits over the hinge body 16 for aesthetics. [0057] The shared armrest 10 optionally includes a lock mechanism to lock the arm members 12, 14 in any position along its arc of pivotal movement. The lock mechanism may be activated by the weight of a person's arm bearing on the arm members 12, 14. The arm members 12, 14 may be biased to return to the undivided condition when not locked in place. The shared armrest 10 may thus include a biasing mechanism, such as a spring, to bias the arms to the undivided condition. [0058] Figures 12 to 14 show another embodiment of a shared armrest 100 with pivoted arm members 1 12, 1 14. With reference to the preceding drawings, like reference numbers refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified. [0059] Whereas the shared armrest 10 has a common swivel axis 28 about which both arm members 12, 14 hinge, the arm members 1 12, 1 14 of the shared armrest 100 each pivot about their own respective swivel axes 1 16, 1 18. The swivel axes 1 16, 1 18 are toward the rear or proximal ends 20 of the arm members 1 12, 1 14. [0060] Figures 15 to 19 show a row terminating armrest 200. The row terminating armrest 200 includes only a single pivoting arm member 212. The row terminating armrest 200 is hingedly displaceable in the horizontal plane between a centred position shown in figure 15 and an angled position shown in figure 16, wherein the armrest is angled inwardly toward the seatback 25. [0061 ] The row terminating armrest 200 includes the same or similar hinge body 216 as the shared armrest 10. The armrest member 212 includes a cover 214. Knuckles 234 of the arm member 212 have radiused end slots or recesses 235. The vertical stop pin 60 can be located in one of three positions in the hinge body 216 to limit the arcuate displacement of the armrest 200. In one position of the stop pin 60, pivoting of the armrest member 212 is allowed in one direction away from the centred position only. In another position of the stop pin 60, pivoting of the armrest member 212 is allowed in an opposite direction away from the centred position only. [0062] Figure 20 shows a shared armrest 300 including a fold-open cover 310. The cover 310 comprises two flap extensions 340. The flap extension 340 are hingedly connected to a central arm 312 of the armrest 300. The flap extensions 340 are hingedly connected to the armrest 300 in the same manner as the flap extensions 40 are hingedly connected to the armrests 12, 14 of the shared armrest 10. [0063] The flap extensions 340 can be folded out into the open position shown in figures 21 and 22. [0064] Figure 23 shows one example of a configuration or arrangement of a row 400 of seats 26 including armrests 10, 200. Neighbouring seats 26 share a shared armrest 10. Seats 26 at the ends of the row 400 include an outer row end armrest 200 at their outer sides. [0065] The shared armrests 10 are shown in the undivided condition in figure 23 and in the split condition in figure 24. Similarly, the row terminating armrests 200 are shown in their centred positions in figure 23 and their angled-in positions in figure 24. [0066] The shared armrest 10 provides for persons sitting abreast in adjacent seats to each have a distinct and separate support member, in the form of the arm members 12, 14 in the split condition, upon which to rest their forearms. The arm members 12, 14 angle inwardly towards the person in the seat in the split condition. Angling the arm members 12, 14 in means part of the arm members 12, 14 on which the forearm can be rested is in an ergonomically convenient position and spaced laterally from an adjacent arm member 12, 14 so that the two persons' arms do not interfere. The common swivel axes 28 about which the armrest members 12, 14 hinge or pivot are towards the back of the seats 26, so that angling the arm members 12, 14 in does not interfere with a torso of a person seated with their backs against the seatbacks 25. [0067] The row of seats 26 having the shared armrest 10 finds application in many environments, including aircraft, trains, auditoriums and cinemas.
