The present invention relates to a process for production of an alkyl methacrylate from an alkylisopropenylketone by the use of a novel enzyme catalysed process, and polymers and copolymers produced therefrom. Acrylic acids and their alkyl esters, in particular, Methacrylic acid (MAA) and its methyl ester, methyl methacrylate (MMA) or ethyl ester, ethyl methacrylate (EMA) are important monomers in the chemical industry. Their main application is in the production of plastics for various applications. The most significant polymerisation application is the casting, moulding or extrusion of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or polyethyl methacrylate (PEMA) to produce high optical clarity plastics. In addition, many copolymers are used, important copolymers are copolymers of methyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate with α-methyl styrene, ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate. Furthermore, by a simple transesterification reaction, MMA and EMA may be converted to other esters such as butyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate etc. Currently MMA (and MAA) is produced by a number of chemical procedures, one of which is the successful ‘Alpha process’ whereby MMA is obtained from the ester methyl propionate by anhydrous reaction with formaldehyde. In the Alpha process, the methyl propionate is produced by the carbonylation of ethylene. This ethylene feedstock is derived from fossil fuels. Recently, it has become desirable to also source sustainable biomass feedstocks for the chemical industry. Accordingly, an alternative biomass route to MMA and instead of using the alpha process would be advantageous. Currently EMA is produced by a number of chemical procedures, one of which is the direct esterification of methacrylic acid; another is the transesterification of MMA with ethyl acetate. Therefore it is one object of the present invention to solve the aforementioned problem, and provide a biological or part biological process for the production of alkyl methacrylates. Surprisingly, the present inventors have found a way to apply unusual enzymes in a novel process to form alkyl methacrylates at an industrially applicable level, thereby providing a new and viable bio-based route to key monomers such as MMA and EMA. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a process of producing an alkyl methacrylate comprising the steps of; (i) converting an alkylisopropenylketone to the corresponding alkyl methacrylate using a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase enzyme. The above process may further comprise the step of formation of an alkylisopropenylketone from raw feedstocks, wherein the term ‘raw feedstocks’ includes any base organic chemical capable of being transformed into an alkylisopropenylketone, for example an alkylisopropylketone, a ketone, a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. In addition, the above process may further comprise the step of performing one or more chemical, biochemical or biological conversions to produce raw feedstocks, wherein the term ‘raw feedstocks’ is as defined hereinbefore. As used herein, the term ‘corresponding’ with reference to converting an alkylisopropenylketone to the relevant alkyl methacrylate means the alkyl group of the alkyl methacrylate produced is the same as the alkyl group of the starting alkylisopropenylketone and the methacrylate is the acyloxy product of the isopropenylketone acyl group. Preferably the alkylisopropenylketone used in the above process is methylisopropenylketone or ethylisopropenylketone. More preferably the alkylisopropenylketone is methylisopropenylketone, which ketone may be selected and combined with any of the aspects, embodiments, or other preferred features of the present invention as contained herein. In one preferred embodiment, when the alkylisopropenylketone is methylisopropenylketone, suitably the alkyl methacrylate produced is methyl methacrylate which methacrylate may be combined with any of the aspects, embodiments, or other preferred features of the present invention as contained herein. Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a process of producing methyl methacrylate comprising the steps of; (i) converting methylisopropenylketone to methyl methacrylate by abnormal oxidation using a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase enzyme Methylisopropenylketone may be prepared by any suitable chemical, biochemical or biological method known in the art.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,146,574 describes in application number 5 of the examples, the oxidative degradation of methylisopropylketone.

Isolation from the oxygenate stream of the liquid phase oxidation of naphtha, or isolation from the oxygenate stream of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, may be performed by any method known in the art, suitably by fractionation of the mixed oxygenate streams as described in, for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,686,317 or Ashford's Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, Third Edition, 2011, page 6013.

Optionally, the raw feedstocks and/or any of the reactants necessary to make them as defined in the exemplary methods above may be sourced from biomass. More preferably, at least one of the raw feedstocks or the reactants necessary for production thereof is sourced from biomass.

Suitable methods for preparing base organic chemicals, such as those used herein as raw feedstocks, from biomass are well known in the art. By way of example, 2-butanone may be produced from biomass via 2,3-butandiol, the 2,3-butandiol having been produced from fermentation of sugar containing biomass by microorganisms. Suitable microorganisms that may be used to produce 2,3-butandiol are, for example, Bacillus polymyxa, Lactobacillus brevis or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Conversion of the 2,3-butandiol produced into 2-butanone may be performed by any known method, for example dehydration by catalysis with morden bentonite clays at temperatures lower than 350 C. Any sugar containing biomass may be used, for example any lignocellulosic, or starch based biomass. For example, see the method described in ‘Bulk Chemicals from Biomass’ by van Havaren et al.

Journal of Polymer Science 21, 5, pp 359-366, or ‘Interchange of Functionality on Conjugated Carbonyl Compounds through Isoxazoles’ by Buechi et al. J.Am.Chem.Soc., 1972, 94 (26), pp 9128-9132 with reference to ‘Process for the preparation of αβ-dialcoylglycerols’ by Colonge et al. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 838 (1947).

Buechi et al. describe in the experimental section 1e, the formation of isopropenyl ethyl ketone by the condensation of diethyl ketone and formaldehyde as described by Colonge et al. Colonge describes under section 1 the general reaction of an aliphatic ketone with formaldehyde, then under section 2 the formation of alpha ethylenic ketones wherein the formation of 2-methyl-pent-1-ene-3-one is described from the condensation of alkaline formaldehyde with ethylenic derivatives of methylpropylketone over a Rayney nickel catalyst. Therefore, according to a further preferred embodiment of a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process of producing ethyl methacrylate comprising the steps of: (i) production of ethylisopropenylketone from raw feedstocks;(ii) converting the ethylisopropenylketone produced to methyl methacrylate using a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase enzyme.

The reaction of 3-pentanone with an alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme suitably under EC group 1.1.1.X, may be performed using an alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme of EC number 1.1.1.1 or 1.1.1.2 from any suitable organism. Suitable methods used to perform such an enzymatic transformation are well known in the art, however suitable examples are given in ‘Substrate specificity and stereoselectivity of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase’ by Adolph et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 201 (1991) pp 615-625, or ‘TADH, the thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermus sp. ATN1: a versatile new biocatalyst for organic synthesis' by Hollrigl et al. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008 November; 81(2):263-73. Examples of suitable chemical methods of preparing 3-pentanone include the ketonization of propionic acid, the dehydrogenation of 1-propanol, or the hydrocarbonylation of ethene. The ketonization of propionic acid, may be performed by any method known in the art, such as passing propionic acid vapour over a zirconium oxide catalyst at 350° C. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,574,074 example 7. An alternative suitable reaction includes using 2.4 g of Platinum impregnated with niobium oxide as a catalyst at 523K for 4 hours under flowing hydrogen at 80 cm3/minute with a 40% propionic acid solution passing over at pressure of 825 psi. For example, see ‘Catalytic upgrading of biomass-derived acids by dehydration/hydrogenation and C—C coupling reactions’ by Serrano-Ruiz et al. University of Wisconsin. Further suitable catalysts include cerium (IV) oxide or manganese dioxide on an alumina support, metal oxide catalysts derived from bulk Keggin heteropoly acids (HPA) H3+n[PMo12-nVnO40] (n=0-2) or a Caesium salt thereof in the vapour phase at 350° C. and 1 bar hydrogen pressure in a fixed bed reactor, or stable polyoxometalate H3PW12O40 (HPW) supported on a silica or a bulk acidic salt Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 (CsPW) support at 250-300 C. in flowing hydrogen and nitrogen gas.

The hydrocarbonylation of ethene, may be performed by any method known in the art, suitable reaction conditions include using an aqueous trifluoroacetic acid solution of Pd(OAc)2/PPh3 under mild conditions in the presence of a 2:1:1 mixture of ethene:carbon monoxide:hydrogen/water. For example, see ‘The production of low molecular weight oxygenates from carbon monoxide and ethene’ by Robertson et al. Coordination Chemistry Reviews 225 (2002) 67-90. Examples of suitable methods of preparing ethylisopropylketone include any chemical, biochemical or biological method known in the art. Methods of preparation of formaldehyde or derivatives thereof have been described above. Optionally, the raw feedstocks and/or any of the reactants necessary to make them as defined in the exemplary methods above may be sourced from biomass. More preferably, at least one of the raw feedstocks or the reactants necessary for production thereof is sourced from biomass. Suitable methods for preparing base organic chemicals, such as those used herein as raw feedstocks, from biomass are well known in the art. By way of example, ethene may be produced from biomass via ethanol which is produced during fermentation of sugar containing biomass. The bio-ethanol produced can be converted by well known techniques such as the dehydration reaction at 300-600 C. over any catalyst selected from alumina, activated clay, zeolite, or mordenite into ethene. Any sugar containing biomass may be used, for example any lignocellulosic, or starch based biomass, but preferably the biomass used is high in sugars such as sugar beet or sugarcane. For example, see the method described in ‘Bulk Chemicals from Biomass’ by van Havaren et al. Biofuels, Bioprod. Bioref. 2:41-57 (2008). As defined in accordance with the process of the first aspect of the present invention, once the alkylisopropenylketone is formed, it is converted to the relevant alkyl methacrylate by the action of a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase enzyme. Baeyer-Villiger oxidation refers to the insertion of an oxygen atom into a ketone to form an ester. In asymmetric ketones, this insertion reaction occurs almost exclusively between the carbonyl carbon and the most stable carbonium ion of the ketone. It is generally known that Baeyer-Villiger oxy-insertion for unsymmetrical ketones has the approximate order of migration of tertiary alkyl> secondary alkyl, aryl> primary alkyl> methyl group (March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure 6th Edition, pg. 1619). Accordingly, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of an alkylisopropenylketone would traditionally be associated with the product of an isopropenylester. Therefore, Baeyer Villiger oxidation of an alkylisopropenylketone is not a route that the skilled person would readily choose as a route to alkyl methacrylates such as MMA or EMA. Nevertheless, the inventors have found that Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases can insert an oxygen atom into alkylisopropenylketones in an abnormal manner, yielding the unlikely product of alkyl methacrylates. Furthermore the use of alkylisopropenylketones to produce alkyl methacrylates in itself is not a well explored route in terms of chemical processing, and the authors are not aware of any analogous industrial chemical process currently in use. Accordingly, firstly using alkylisopropenylketones as a starting material to produce alkyl methacrylates is in itself unusual, and secondly seeking a bio-based enzymatic version of such a route is unprecedented. Surprisingly, therefore, this has led to an unusual and novel biological route to alkyl methacrylate monomers for the polymer industry via abnormal Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. By the term ‘abnormal’ when used herein in relation to the oxidation of an alkylisopropenylketone substrate by a Baeyer Villiger Monooxygenase enzyme, it is meant that the enzyme catalyses the insertion of an oxygen between the carbonyl carbon and the alkyl group of the ketone. It is known that Baeyer-Villiger oxidative enzymes are common to various organisms including bacteria, plants, animals, archea, and fungi. Baeyer-Villiger oxidative enzymes can catalyse the conversion of ketones to esters. However, those enzymes that are reported are only described as acting in biological systems on ring based ketones (lactones), rather than the straight chain aliphatic ketones. In the few studies where their activity on straight chain aliphatic ketones has been tested, they are reported as having very low activity. There are no reports of the action of Baeyer-Villager oxidative enzymes on unsaturated aliphatic ketones. The term Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase′ as used herein preferably refers to an enzyme capable of catalysing oxidation reactions belonging to the EC classification group 1.14.13.X and such enzymes generally comprise the following characteristic sequences: two Rossman fold protein sequence motifs (GxGxxG) at the N-terminus and the middle of the protein sequence respectively, and the typical BVMO binding motif FxGxxxHxxxW[P/D] located in a loop region of the folded protein which characteristic sequences may be selected and combined with any of the aspects, embodiments, or other preferred features of the present invention as contained herein. According to a further preferred embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention there is provided a process of producing an alkyl methacrylate, preferably, methyl methacrylate, comprising the steps of; (i) converting an alkylisopropenylketone, preferably methyl isopropenylketone to the corresponding alkyl methacrylate using an enzyme comprising the following characteristic sequences: two Rossman fold protein sequence motifs (GxGxxG) at the N-terminus and the middle of the protein sequence respectively, and the typical BVMO binding motif FxGxxxHxxxW[P/D] located in a loop region of the folded protein The Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase may be a wild type enzyme, or a modified enzyme which enzyme type may be selected and combined with any of the aspects, embodiments, or other preferred features of the present invention as contained herein capable of working with a wild type or modified enzyme. In addition, the enzyme may be synthetic whether in accordance with the wild type or a modification thereof which enzyme type may be selected and combined with any of the aspects, embodiments, or other preferred features of the present invention as contained herein capable of working with a synthetic enzyme. In any case, the modified Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase should preferably be as active and/or selective as the wild type, more preferably, more active and/or selective than the wild type in the oxidative transformation of the alkylisopropenylketone, preferably, methyl isopropenylketone to produce alkylmethacrylate. The term ‘wild type’ as used herein whether with reference to polypeptides such as enzymes, polynucleotides such as genes, organisms, cells, or any other matter refers to the naturally occurring form of said matter. The term ‘modified’ as used herein with reference to polypeptides such as enzymes, polynucleotides such as genes, organisms, cells, or any other matter refers to such matter as being different to the wild type. The term ‘microbe convertible gas(es)’ as used herein means a gas or gases that can be converted by microbes into a raw feedstock. A suitable gas is a gas rich in CO and a suitable fermentation is described in US 2012/0045807A1 which converts CO to 2,3-butandiol using anaerobic fermentation with Clostridia such as Clostridium autoethanogenum, ljundahlii and ragsdalei in appropriate media and under the conditions known to the skilled person.

Alterations to the genetic material may include any genetic modification known in the art which will render the material different to the wild type. Examples of such genetic modifications include, but are not limited to: deletions, insertions, substitutions, fusions etc. which may be performed on the polynucleotide/s sequence containing the relevant gene or genes to be modified. Such genetic modifications within the scope of the present invention may also include any suitable epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic modifications may include any modification that affects the relevant genetic material without modification of the polynucleotide/s sequence containing the relevant gene or genes to be modified. Examples of epigenetic modifications include, but are not limited to; nucleic acid methylation or acetylation, histone modification, paramutation, gene silencing, etc. Alterations to protein material may include any protein modification known in the art which will render the material different to the wild type. Examples of such protein modifications include, but are not limited to: cleaving parts of the polypeptide including fragmentation; attaching other biochemically functional groups; changing the chemical nature of an amino acid; changing amino acid residues including conservative and non-conservative substitutions, deletions, insertions etc; changing the bonding of the polypeptide etc; which may be performed on the polypeptide/s sequence which fold(s) to form the relevant protein or proteins to be modified. Alterations to the structure of said materials may include any structural modification known in the art which will render the structure of genetic or protein material different to the wild type. Examples of such structural modifications include modifications caused by, but not limited to, the following factors: the interaction with other structures; interactions with solvents; interactions with substrates, products, cofactors, coenzymes, or any other chemical present in a suitable reaction including other polynucleotides or polypeptides; the creation of quaternary protein structures; changing the ambient temperature or pH etc. which may be performed on the structure(s) of the relevant genetic or protein material(s) of interest.

The genes encoding various BVMO enzymes reported in the literature were obtained and expressed in E. coli fused to the N-terminus of a thermostable phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH, EC 1.20.1.1) for cofactor regeneration. The host E. coli cells were then lysed by sonication to obtain disrupted cell fractions, and underwent centrifugation to remove cell debirs and obtain a cleared cell extract. See methods as described in ‘Expanding the set of rhodococcal Baeyer Villiger Monooxygenases by high throughput cloning, expression and substrate screening’ by Riebel et al. Appl. Microbiol. Biottechnol. (2011). Biocatalysis Protocol Transformations were performed in 15 ml Pyrex tubes. Reaction volumes (1 ml) contained 5 mM methylisopropenylketone, 5 uM ‘reducing FAD’, and 5 μM cleared cell extract containing the relevant BVMO, in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Mixtures were incubated at 24° C. under orbital shaking (200 rpm) for 22 hours. To determine conversion, 1 ml reaction volume was extracted with 0.5 ml 1-octanol containing 0.1% mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) as internal standard. Samples were extracted by vortexing for 1 min, followed by a centrifugation step (5000 rpm) for 10 min. The organic layer was removed, dried with MgSO4 and placed in a gas chromatography (GC) vial. GC analysis occurred on a Shimadzu GC instrument fitted with a Heliflex® AT™-5 column (Grace Discovery Sciences). The following temperature profile was used to separate the components: 6 min at 40° C. followed by an increase to 250° C. at 20° C. per minute. Blank reactions without enzyme and with varying amounts of substrate (methylisopropenylketone) and product (methyl methacrylate, isopropenyl acetate) were carried out under identical circumstances and used to prepare calibration curves for product identification and determination of conversion. GC Analysis Table 1 below details the percentage of the compounds produced by GC following extraction with 1-octanol+0.1% mesitylene from 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (AT-5 column, 5 mM all compounds). All three compounds (1 substrate and 2 products) could reliably be separated by GC.
