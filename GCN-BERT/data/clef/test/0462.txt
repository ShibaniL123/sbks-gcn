(6) Preparation of tert-butyl 7-oxo-2-azaspiro[3.5]nonane-2-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 8,11-dioxa-2-azadispiro[3.3.47.24]tridecane-2-carboxylate (2 g, 7.06 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (244 mg, 1.42 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture solvent of acetone and water (10:1, 30 mL), stirred at 45Â°C overnight. The reaction was cooled, concentrated in vacuum, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate : petroleum ether =1:10-1:2) to obtain the title compound as a white solid (1.2 g, yield 71.0%).
