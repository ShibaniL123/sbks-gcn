STABLE FORMULATIONS CONTAINING FUMED ALUMINUM OXIDE FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates to the field of agrochemical formulations. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] To enable the efficient elimination or controlling of unwanted plants, it is desirable to use effective chemical formulations of herbicides. Compositions containing two or more herbicides are desirable in agricultural, specialty applications and related endeavors due to broadening the spectrum or range of unwanted plant species killed or controlled. [0003] Due to the desirability of having a composition with the above-mentioned properties, it is useful to use combinations of herbicides to obtain enhanced control of numerous weeds with a single herbicidal application. Combinations of pesticides are known and available as mixed solutions of the active ingredients in their commercially available formulations. One method of preparing such a composition is referred to as "tank mixing" in which the ingredients in their commercially available form are mixed together by the user in a quantity of water. Tank mixes require the end user to purchase two or more commercial formulations, store them, calculate the correct amount of each active ingredient, measure those amounts into the mix and when empty, properly dispose of a number of containers. Tank mixing two or three different commercial formulations often results in physical instabilities causing precipitation of active ingredients, flocculation, phase separation and the like, providing uneven distribution of the active ingredients. Combining active ingredients into one formulation is beneficial but frequently more complex due to widely different physical properties of the active ingredients in which chemical and physical stability are problems. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0004] The present invention provides novel herbicidal aqueous suspoemulsion or aqueous suspension concentrate compositions containing an herbicidal active agent and fumed alumina as a stabilization agent that have superior chemical and physical stability as well as superior re-dispersion properties. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0005] The present invention provides novel herbicidal aqueous suspoemulsion or aqueous suspension concentrate compositions containing an herbicidal active agent and fumed alumina as a stabilization agent that have superior chemical and physical stability as well as superior re-dispersion properties. [0006] In one aspect the present invention relates to a novel aqueous suspoemulsion composition containing an herbicidal agent comprised of atrazine, pyroxasulfone and fluthiacet-methyl that has superior chemical and physical stability as well as superior re-dispersion. [0007] In particular the aqueous suspoemulsion composition of the present invention comprises: i) an aqueous suspension concentrate composition containing pyroxasulfone and atrazine; ii) an emulsion in water composition containing fluthiacet-methyl; and iii) fumed alumina. [0008] Another embodiment of the present invention is a process for the preparation of an aqueous suspoemulsion composition comprising: i) forming an aqueous suspension concentrate composition containing pyroxasulfone and atrazine; ii) forming an emulsion in water composition containing fluthiacet-methyl; iii) blending the suspension concentrate and emulsion in water compositions together and iv) adding fumed alumina and blending the mixture to form a homogenous mixture. [0009] Still another embodiment of the present invention is a process for the preparation of an aqueous suspoemulsion composition comprising: i) forming an aqueous suspension concentrate composition containing pyroxasulfone and atrazine and fumed alumina; ϋ) forming an emulsion in water composition containing fluthiacet-methyl; iii) blending the suspension concentrate and emulsion in water compositions together to form a homogenous mixture. [0010] Another embodiment of the present invention is an aqueous suspension concentrate composition comprising: i) an agriculturally active component comprising fluthiacet-methyl, atrazine and pyroxasulfone; ϋ) a surfactant component comprising an acrylic graft copolymer and a polyalkylene oxide block copolymer; iii) an antifoam agent; iv) a biocide; ν) a pH adjusting agent; vi) an antifreeze agent; and vii) fumed alumina. [0011] It has been surprisingly discovered that the addition of fumed alumina to a suspoemulsion or suspension concentrate compositions provides exceptional physical and chemical stability to the compositions. Other stabilizing agents, for example, fumed silica, when used in the present suspoemulsion or suspension concentrate compositions, provide good chemical stability but lack physical stability (e.g. precipitates form after 24 hours at room temperature, re-dispersion difficulties). Adding fumed alumina to the present suspoemulsion or suspension concentrate compositions provides chemically and physically stable compositions. In preparing a suspoemulsion composition, fumed alumina can be added to the suspension concentrate composition portion, or may be added to the final formulation composition; preferably it is added to the suspension concentrate portion of the composition. [0012] In one aspect of the present invention a suspoemulsion composition is formed by combining a suspension concentrate composition with an emulsion in water composition. A suspension concentrate (SC) is a formulation in which a solid active ingredient(s) is suspended in a liquid carrier.

[0015] The weight ratio of fluthiacet-methyl to pyraxosulfone to atrazine can vary over a wide range but is usually in the range of 1:33:284 to 1:40:325. [0016] A particular embodiment of the present invention is a method for the control of unwanted plants comprising applying a pesticidally effective amount of the composition of the present invention to an area where such control is desired. [0017] As used in this specification and, unless otherwise indicated, the term “herbicide” refers to a molecule or combination of molecules that inhibits or otherwise kills unwanted plants, such as, but not limited to, deleterious or annoying weeds, broadleaf plants, grasses and sedges and can be used for crop protection, edifice protection or turf protection. The term "herbicidally effective amount" means an amount necessary to produce an observable herbicidal effect on unwanted plant growth, including the effects of necrosis, death, growth inhibition, reproduction inhibition, inhibition of proliferation, and removal, destmction, or otherwise diminishing the occurrence and activity of unwanted plants. [0018] The terms “ambient temperature” and “room temperature” as utilized herein shall generally mean any suitable temperature found in a laboratory or other working quarter, and is generally neither below about 15° C nor above about 30° C.

The suspoemulsion of Example 3 was also analyzed for physical and chemical stability at one and three months at 50°C and one month at room temperature. Sample viscosity (centipoise) was measured using a Brookfield RVT viscometer, spindle number 3, spindle speed of 50. Particle size was measured using a particle size distribution analyzer (Horiba Particle Scattering Particle Size Distribution Analyzer LA-910) at D90 (90% of the particles were of the size reported in microns). Percent separation was measured visually by measuring the height of the separated layer and dividing that number by the total height of the container. Analysis for the active ingredients was performed by HPLC analysis on a % by weight basis. These data are summarized in Table 4Β below.
