ORAL CARE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING POLYORGANOSILSESQUIOXANE PARTICLES FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to oral care compositions containing abrasives, and methods for cleaning and polishing teeth using these compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION An effective oral composition can maintain and preserve tooth appearance by removing dental stains and polishing the teeth. It may clean and remove external debris as well, which can aid the prevention of tooth decay and promote gingival health. Abrasives in oral compositions aid in the removal of the tightly adherent pellicle film to which dental stains affix. Pellicle film usually comprises a thin acellular, glycoproteinmucoprotein coating, which adheres to the enamel within minutes after teeth are cleaned. The presence of various food pigments lodged within the film accounts for most instances of teeth discoloration. An effective abrasive may remove the pellicle film with minimal abrasive damage to oral tissue, such as the dentin and enamel. In addition to cleaning, it may be desirable for abrasive systems to provide polishing of tooth surfaces, as polished surfaces may be more resistant to ectopic deposition of undesirable components. Tooth appearance may be improved by imparting a polished character to the teeth, because the surface roughness, that is, its polish, affects light reflectance and scattering, which integrally relate to the teeth’s visual appearance. The surface roughness also affects tooth feel. For example, polished teeth have a clean, smooth, and slick feel. Numerous dentifrice compositions use precipitated silicas (among other materials) as abrasives. Precipitated silicas are noted and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,340,583, July 20, 1982, to Wason, ΕΡ Patent 535,943Α1, April 7, 1993, to McKeown et al., PCT Application WO 92/02454, Feb. 20, 1992 to McKeown et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,603,920, Feb. 18, 1997, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,601, Feb. 10, 1998, both to Rice, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,740,311, May 25, 2004 to White et al. While generally providing safe and effective cleaning of teeth, precipitated silicas in oral compositions may present compatibility problems and undesirable interactions with other desirable formula actives, such as metal ions, peroxide, fluoride and cationic antibacterials. These undesirable interactions may lead to reduction in the amount of active available in the formulation and/or reduction in product efficacy. These compatibility problems have been shown to be directly related to surface properties of precipitated silicas such as surface area, number of hydroxyl groups, and porosity. Another potential problem linked with surface properties of precipitated silicas used in oral composition is interactions with flavor components in the formula. This interaction may lead to production of off-flavors over the shelf life of the product, rendering the product unacceptable to consumers. A need therefore exists for an abrasive system that first and foremost provides effective and safe cleaning and polishing of teeth and further has good compatibility with oral care actives such as key dentifrice components in oral compositions, particularly oral care compositions. In addition, there exists a continuing need for abrasives that can produce superior cleaning and polishing at reduced costs. Commercially available polyorganosilsequioxane particles, more specifically polymethylsilsesquioxane silicone resin particles are commonly used in cosmetic applications to provide water repellency, lubricity, and impart a smooth, silky feel and/or appearance to skin. Materials sold by Momentive, under the tradename “TOSPEARL” are examples of such silicone resins, also known as T-resins or methylsilsesquioxanes. TOSPEARL 120Α, 130Α, 145Α, 150ΚΑ and 2000Β resins are commercially available spherical silicone resins available in 2.0, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0 and 6.0 micron median particle sizes, respectively. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to oral care compositions comprising a polyorganosilsesquioxane particle abrasive and at least one stannous ion source, preferably comprising a polymethylsilsesquioxane particle abrasive. The present invention further relates to methods for cleaning and polishing dental enamel using these compositions. It has surprisingly been found that polyorganosilsesquioxane particles, preferably polymethylsilsesquioxane particles, commonly used in cosmetic products to provide water repellency, lubricity, and imparting smooth, silky feel and/or appearance to skin, can provide abrasive cleaning properties to teeth when used in oral compositions. Further, such particles surprisingly and importantly offer improved stability with certain oral care actives over that observed with other commonly utilized oral care abrasives such as precipitated silica. The present invention therefore utilizes polyorganosilsesquioxane particles in oral compositions, particularly in dentifrice compositions. Current dentifrice compositions available to consumers often use silica as a thickening agent as well as an abrasive, the silica typically used is precipitated silica. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the polyorganosilsesquioxane particles, particularly polymethylsilsesquioxane particles, have an inert surface and are less reactive than precipitated silica. Consequently, the polyorganosilsesquioxane particles may adsorb less of other components, such as flavors, actives, or cations, leading to better availability for these other components. For example, dentifrices incorporating polyorganosilsesquioxane particles have demonstrated superior stability in compositions with stannous ions and hydrogen peroxide. Without being bound by theory, it is also expected that polyorganosilsesquioxane particles would also demonstrate improved stability with fluoride, zinc, other cationic antibacterials, and similar materials that typically react negatively to precipitated silica. The polyorganosilsesquioxane particles, preferably polymethylsilsesquioxane particles, of the present invention may provide one or more of these advantages. The present invention therefore relates to oral compositions and methods of using such oral compositions that may provide better active stability. The present invention’s compositions and methods may provide better flavor aesthetics. And the present invention’s compositions and methods may provide improved tooth cleaning without increased abrasiveness. The present invention therefore relates to oral compositions containing at least 0.01%, by weight of the composition, of one or more polyorganosilsesquioxane particles; and an orally acceptable carrier; wherein the polyorganosilsesquioxane particles are substantially insoluble in the composition. The present invention further relates to the above compositions wherein the polyorganosilsesquioxane particles are selected from polymethylsilsesquioxane particles, preferably having an average volume weighted mean particle size of from about 1 to about 20 microns. The present invention further relates to such compositions wherein the composition is substantially free of volatile carriers capable of solubilizing the organosiloxane particles in the composition and/or the composition is substantially free of polysiloxanes and/or the composition is substantially free of carbomer. The present invention further relates to the above compositions wherein the composition comprises at least 0.01%, by weight of the composition, of an oral care active which may be selected from antibacterial agents, antiplaque agents, anticaries agents, antisensitivity agents, antierosion agents, oxidizing agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anticalculus agents, chelating agents, tooth substantive agents, antioxidants, analgesic agents, anesthetic agents, H-l and H-2 antagonists, antiviral actives, nutrients and mixtures thereof or may be selected from stannous fluoride, sodium fluoride, monofluorophosphate, essential oils, mono alkyl phosphates, hydrogen peroxide, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, triclosan, and combinations thereof. The present invention further relates to the above compositions wherein the polymethylsilsesquioxane particles are spherical smooth surface particles. The present invention further relates to the above compositions wherein the abrasive comprises from about 50% to about 100%, by weight of all the abrasive in the composition, of the polyorganosilsesquioxane particles. The present invention further relates methods of reducing plaque, gingivitis, sensitivity, oral malodor, erosion, cavities, calculus, inflammation, and staining by administering to a subject’s oral cavity one or more of the above compositions.

Polyorganosilsesquioxane particles The oral compositions herein contain an effective amount of a polyorganosilsesquioxane particle, preferably a polymethylsilsesquioxane particle, to provide an abrasive, tooth-cleaning benefit. The oral compositions herein may include from about 0.1 to about 30%, by weight of the composition, of the particles. In another embodiment, the composition comprises from about 0.5 to about 20%, by weight of the composition, alternatively from about 1 to about 10%, by weight of the composition, of the particles. The composition may include from about 0.1% to about 50%, alternatively from about 1% to about 40%, alternatively from about 2% to about 35%, alternatively from about 4% to about 30%, alternatively from about 5% to about 25%, by weight of the composition, of the polyorganosilsequioxane, preferably polymethylsilsesquioxane, particles. Polyorganosilsesquioxane particles are a type of silicone material formed by branched, cage-like oligosiloxanes with the general formula of RnSiXmOy, where R is a non reactive substituent, usually Me or Ph, and X is a functional group Η, OH, Cl or OR. These groups may be further condensed, to give highly crosslinked, insoluble polysiloxane networks. Figure 1 provides the general structure. When R is methyl, the four possible functional siloxane monomeric units are described as follows: "M" is MesSiO, “D" is Me2Si02, "T" is MeSiOs and "Q" is Si04. A network of only T-groups becomes polymethylsilsesquioxane. These materials are generally insoluble in typical oral care compositions, such as dentifrice. Commercially available polymethylsilsesquioxane particles are commonly used in cosmetic applications to provide water repellency, lubricity, and impart a smooth, silky feel and/or appearance to skin. Materials sold by Momentive, under the tradename “TOSPEARL” are examples of such polymethylsilsesquioxane silicone resins, also known as T-resins or methylsilsesquioxanes. TOSPEARL 120Α, 130Α, CF600, 145Α, 150ΚΑ and2000B resins are commercially available spherical silicone resins available in 2.0, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0 and 6.0 micron average median particle sizes, respectively. TOSPEARL 3120 is available with a 13.0 micron average median particle size. TOSPEARL 145Α microspheres have a narrower particle size distribution and are particularly preferred for use herein. TOSPEARL 2000Β have particles (on average) almost as small as TOSPEARL 145Α microspheres and a slightly broader particle size distribution. TOSPEARL 3000Α microspheres have an average particle size almost as large as TOSPEARL 2000Β and has a slightly broader particle size distribution. TOSPEARL 145Α, 2000Β and 3000Α all represent polymethylsilsesquioxane particles useful herein. Table 1 shows the published properties of TOSPEARL materials commercially available from Momentive.

Cumulative volume percent is the percent, by volume, of a distribution having a particle size of less than or equal to a given value and where particle size is the diameter of an equivalent spherical particle. The mean particle size in a distribution is the size in microns of the silica particles at the 50% point for that distribution. The size distribution and volume mean diameter for a particle size distribution may be calculated using a laser light scattering PSD system such as those commercially available from Malvern and/or determined using the methods disclosed in U.S. patent application 2007/0001037Α1, published Jan. 4, 2007. In plotting particle size, D [4,3] is the volume mean diameter, d(0.1) or D10 is the size (microns) of the particles sample below which 10% of the sample lies. d(0.5) or D50 is the size (microns) at which 50% of the particles sample is smaller and 50% is larger, also referred to as the “mass median diameter” or “MMD.” d(0.9) or D90 is the size (microns) of the particles sample below which 90% of the sample lies. The width of the particle size distribution of a given composition can be characterized using a span ratio. As used herein, the span ratio is defined as the cumulative diameter of the particles in the tenth volume percentile minus the cumulative volume at the ninetieth percentile divided by the diameter of the particles in the fiftieth volume percentile, i.e. (D10-D90)/D50. The average volume weighted mean particle size of the polyorganosilsesquioxane particles, preferably polymethylsilsesquioxane particles, may range from about 1 to about 20 microns, alternatively from about 1 to about 15 microns, alternatively from about 2 to about 15 microns, alternatively from about 2 to about 12 microns, alternatively from about 3 to about 12 microns, alternatively from about 2 to about 10 microns, alternatively from about 3 to about 7 microns, alternatively from about 3 to about 6 microns, alternatively from about 4 to about 6 microns. In an embodiment, the average volume weighted mean particle size of the polyorganosilsesquioxane, preferably polymethylsilsesquioxane particles, is from about 3 to about 8, alternatively from about 4 to about 7 microns and the d (0.1) is from about 2 to about 4, alternatively from about 2 to about 3 and the d (0.9) is from about 4 to about 9, alternatively from about 5 to about 8 microns. The Specific Surface Area may be from about 15 to about 40, alternatively from about 15 to about 35, alternatively from about 10 to about 30, alternatively from about 15m2/g to about 25m2/g. The linseed oil absorption rate may be from about 50 to about 80, alternatively from about 55 to about 80, alternatively from about 55 to about 65 ml/lOOg. Polyorganosilsesquioxane particles formulated in a dentifrice composition may result in at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% compatibility with cations or other components. In some embodiments, the cation may be stannous. PCR/RDA ratios. The Pellicle Cleaning Ratio (PCR) of the polyorganosilsesquioxane particles of the present invention, which is a measure of the cleaning characteristics of a dentifrice, ranges from about 40 to about 200 and preferably from about 60 to about 200. The compositions of the present invention may exhibit a PCR of at least 70, alternatively greater than about 80, alternatively greater than about 90. The Radioactive Dentine Abrasion (RDA) of the inventive silica, which is a measure of the abrasiveness of the polyorganosilsesquioxane particles when incorporated into a dentifrice, is less than about 250, and may range from about 40 to about 230. The compositions of the present invention may exhibit an RDA Score of less than 200, alternatively at most 100, alternatively at most 80. The PCR values are determined by the method discussed in “In Vitro Removal of Stain with Dentifrice,” G.K. Stookey, et al., J. Dental Res., 61, 1236-9, 1982. The RDA values are determined according to the method set forth by Hefferren, Journal of Dental Research, July-August 1976, ρρ. 563-573; and described in Wason, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,340,583, 4,420,312, and 4,421,527. RDA values may also be determined by the ADA recommended procedure for determination of dentifrice abrasivity. The PCR/RDA ratio of the polyorganosilsesquioxane particles, when incorporated into a dentifrice, may be greater than 1, indicating that the dentifrice is providing effective pellicle cleaning without too much abrasivity. The PCR/RDA ratio may also be at least about 0.5. The PCR/RDA ratio is a function of the particle size, shape, texture, hardness, and concentration. The shape of the particles of polyorganosilsesquioxane particles are generally classified as spherical but the surface can be smooth or spiky, or a combination of shapes, depending on the type of manufacturing process. “Spherical” includes particles where the shape of the overall particle is mostly rounded or elliptical in shape but can include particles wherein the surface has bumps or “spikes” extending from the core rounded or elliptical shape. For example, TOSPEARL 145Α has a spherical, smooth shape with an mean average particle size of 5.0, while TOSPEARL 150ΚΑ has a spherical, “spiky” shape with a mean average particle size of 5.0, both materials commercially available from Momentive Performance Materials, New York, USA. Surprisingly, spherical, smooth surface polymethylsilsesquioxane particles provide better pellicle cleaning ratio “PCR” than the “spiky” spherical particles of a similar mean average particle size as may be seen in Example 1, below and in Figure 2. In one embodiment, the polyorganosilsesquioxane particles are selected from spherical, smooth surface particles, and mixtures thereof. The polyorganosilsesquioxane particles, preferably polymethylsilsesquioxane particles, are substantially insoluble in the oral care compositions herein. In one embodiment, the composition is substantially free of volatile carriers capable of solubilizing the organosiloxane particles in the composition. In one embodiment, the composition is substantially free of polysiloxanes. In one embodiment, the composition is substantially free of carbomer. In one embodiment, the composition is substantially free of emollients and waxes. Oral Care Active One of the advantages of polyorganosilsesquioxane particles is its compatibility with other materials, particularly materials that are reactive and can lose efficacy such as actives. Because surprisingly, polyorganosilsesquioxane particles do not react as much with actives as compared to precipitated silica and other traditional abrasives, less of the active can be used with the same efficacy. If the active has any potential aesthetic negatives such an unpleasant or strong taste, astringency, staining, or other negative aesthetic, the lower amount of active may be preferred. Additionally, the use of less active for the same or similar efficacy is a cost savings. Alternatively, if the same amount of active as used as traditionally used, the active would have higher efficacy as more of it is available to provide the benefit. The compositions herein include a stannous ion source in the oral care active and may include additional oral care actives. Oral care actives useful herein include antibacterial agents, antiplaque agents, anticaries agents, antisensitivity agents, antierosion agents, oxidizing agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anticalculus agents, chelating agents, tooth substantive agents, antioxidants, analgesic agents, anesthetic agents, H-l and H-2 antagonists, antiviral actives, nutrients and mixtures thereof. These materials are described more fully below and a material or ingredient may be categorized as more than one type of materials. Such as an antioxidant may also be an antiplaque and antibacterial active. Examples of suitable actives include stannous fluoride, sodium fluoride, essential oils, mono alkyl phosphates, hydrogen peroxide, CPC, chlorhexidine, Triclosan, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the oral care active is selected from stannous fluoride, sodium fluoride, monofluorophosphate, cetylpyridinium chloride, triclosan, arginine, and mixtures thereof. Mixtures of oral care actives may be used. In one embodiment, the oral care active is selected from one or more of a fluoride ion source, zinc ion source, calcium ion source, phosphate ion source, potassium ion source, strontium ion source, aluminum ion source, magnesium ion source, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the oral care active is a mixture of stannous ion source, fluoride ion source, and zinc ion source. Antibacterial Agent The oral care active may include an effective amount of an antibacterial agent. The composition may contain from about 0.001% to about 20%, alternatively from about from about 0.1% to about 5%, by weight of the oral care composition, of one or more antibacterial agents. Antibacterial agents useful herein include chlorhexidine, alexidine, hexetidine, benzalkonium chloride, domiphen bromide, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), tetradecylpyridinium chloride (TPC), N-tetradecyl-4-ethylpyridinium chloride (TDEPC), octenidine, bisbiguanides, zinc or stannous ion agents, grapefruit extract, and mixtures thereof. Other antibacterial and antimicrobial agents include: 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-phenol, commonly referred to as triclosan; 8-hydroxyquinoline and its salts, copper II compounds, including, copper(II) chloride, copper(II) sulfate, copper(II) acetate, copper(II) fluoride and copper(II) hydroxide; phthalic acid and its salts including those disclosed in U.S. Pat. 4,994,262, including magnesium monopotassium phthalate; sanguinarine; salicylanilide; iodine; sulfonamides; phenolics; delmopinol, octapinol, and other piperidino derivatives; niacin preparations; nystatin; apple extract; thyme oil; thymol; antibiotics such as augmentin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, metronidazole, neomycin, kanamycin, cetylpyridinium chloride, and clindamycin; analogs and salts of the above; methyl salicylate; hydrogen peroxide; metal salts of chlorite; pyrrolidone ethyl cocoyl arginate; lauroyl ethyl arginate monochlorohydrate; and mixtures of all of the above. In another embodiment, the composition comprises phenolic antimicrobial compounds and mixtures thereof. Other antimicrobial agents include essential oils. Essential oils are volatile aromatic oils which may be synthetic or may be derived from plants by distillation, expression or extraction, and which usually carry the odor or flavor of the plant from which they are obtained. Useful essential oils may provide antiseptic activity. Some essential oils may also act as flavoring agents. Useful essential oils include but are not limited to citra, thymol, menthol, methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil), eucalyptol, carvacrol, camphor, anethole, carvone, eugenol, isoeugenol, limonene, osimen, n-decyl alcohol, citronel, a-salpineol, methyl acetate, citronellyl acetate, methyl eugenol, cineol, linalool, ethyl linalaol, safrola vanillin, spearmint oil, peppermint oil, lemon oil, orange oil, sage oil, rosemary oil, cinnamon oil, pimento oil, laurel oil, cedar leaf oil, gerianol, verbenone, anise oil, bay oil, benzaldehyde, bergamot oil, bitter almond, chiorothymol, cinnamic aldehyde, citronella oil, clove oil, coal tar, eucalyptus oil, guaiacol, tropolone derivatives such as hinokitiol, avender oil, mustard oil, phenol, phenyl salicylate, pine oil, pine needle oil, sassafras oil, spike lavender oil, storax, thyme oil, tolu balsam, terpentine oil, clove oil, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment the essential oils are selected from thymol, methyl salicylate, eucalyptol, menthol and combinations thereof. In one embodiment of the present invention, oral care compositions are provided comprising a blend of naturally occurring flavor ingredients or essential oils (ΕΟ) containing such flavor ingredients, the blend exhibiting excellent antimicrobial activity and comprising at least two components, a first component selected from acyclic or non-ring structures such as citral, neral, geranial, geraniol and nerol and a second component selected from ring-containing or cyclic structures such as eucalyptol, eugenol and carvacrol. Essential oils may be used to provide the above flavor ingredients including oils of lemongrass, citrus (orange, lemon, lime), citronella, geranium, rose, eucalyptus, oregano, bay and clove. Preferred for use herein are natural oils or extracts that have been purified or concentrated to contain mainly the desired component(s). Other antibacterial agents may be basic amino acids and salts. Other embodiments may comprise arginine. Anti-Plaque Agent The oral care active may include an effective amount of an anti-plaque agent. The composition may contain from about 0.001% to about 20%, alternatively from about from about 0.1% to about 5%, by weight of the oral care composition, of one or more anti-plaque agents. Anti-plaque agents useful herein include stannous salts, copper salts, strontium salts, magnesium salts, copolymers of carboxylated polymers such as GANTREZ or a dimethicone copolyol. The dimethicone copolyol is selected from C12 to C20 alkyl dimethicone copolyols and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the dimethicone copolyol is cetyl dimethicone copolyol marketed under the Trade Name ABIL ΕΜ90. The dimethicone copolyol in one embodiment can be present in a level of from about 0.001% to about 25%, in another embodiment from about 0.01% to about 5%, and in another embodiment from about 0.1% to about E5% by weight of the oral composition. Anti-Caries Agent The oral care active may include an effective amount of an anti-caries agent. In one embodiment, the anti-caries agent is a fluoride ion source. The fluoride ion may be present in an amount sufficient to give a fluoride ion concentration in the composition at 25°C, and/or in one embodiment can be used at levels of from about 0.0025% to about 5.0% by weight of the composition, alternatively from about 0.005% to about 2.0% by weight of the composition, to provide anticaries effectiveness. Examples of suitable fluoride ion-yielding materials are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,535,421, and 3,678,154. Representative fluoride ion sources include: stannous fluoride, sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, amine fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, zinc fluoride, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the oral care composition contains a fluoride source selected from stannous fluoride, sodium fluoride, and mixtures thereof. The pH of the oral composition may be from about 3 to about 10. The pH is typically measured as a slurry pH by methods known in the industry. Depending upon the actives used in the oral composition, a different pH may be desired. For formulations containing fluoride, it may be desired to have a pH slightly lower than typical dentifrices. Compositions containing polyorganosilsesquioxane particles and fluoride may have a pH of less than about 6.5 or less than about 5.5. The pH may be less than about 5.2 or about 5.0. It may be desired to have a pH of from about 3.5 to about 5 or from about 2.4 to about 4.8. For formulations containing peroxide and polyorganosilsesquioxane particles, the pH may be less than 5.5, alternatively less than 5.0, alternatively less than 4.5. A formulation with peroxide and polyorganosilsesquioxane particles may be from about 3.5 to about 4.0. For formulations comprising polyorganosilsesquioxane particles, stannous, and fluoride, it may be desired to have a pH of less than 5.0. Without being limited by theory, a pH of less than 5.0 may enable more of the SnF3 stannous species to be formed. Anti-Sensitivity Agents The oral care active may include an effective amount of an anti-sensitivity agent. The composition may contain from about 0.001% to about 20%, alternatively from about from about 0.1% to about 5%, by weight of the oral care composition, of the anti-sensitivity agent. Anti-sensitivity agents useful herein include tubule blocking agents and/or desensitivity agents. Tubule blocking agents may be selected from the group consisting of stannous ion source, strontium ion source, calcium ion source, phosphorus ion source, aluminum ion source, magnesium ion source, amino acids, bioglasses, nanoparticulates, polycarboxylates, GANTREZ, and mixtures thereof. The amino acids may be basic amino acids, and a basic amino acid may be arginine. Nanoparticulates may be selected from the group consisting of nanohydroxy apatite, nanotitanium dioxide, nano metal oxides, and mixtures thereof. The desensitivity agent may be a potassium salt selected from the group consisting of potassium fluoride, potassium citrate, potassium nitrate, potassium chloride, and mixtures thereof. Some embodiments may be a method of reducing hypersensitivity of the teeth by administering to a subject in need an oral care composition comprising a polyorganosilsesquioxane particles. Anti-Erosion Agents The oral care active may include an effective amount of an anti-erosion agent, such as a stannous ion source. As stated before, one of the advantages of polyorganosilsesquioxane particles is its compatibility with other materials, particularly materials that are reactive and can lose efficacy, such as stannous ions. Because polyorganosilsesquioxane particles do not react as much with stannous as compared to precipitated silica and other traditional abrasives, less of the stannous can be used with the same efficacy. It has been reported that stannous may have potential aesthetic negatives such an unpleasant or strong taste, astringency, staining, or other negative aesthetics that make the stannous containing oral compositions less desirable for consumers. The stannous ions may be provided from stannous fluoride and/or other stannous salts.

Chelating Agent The oral care active may include an effective amount of a chelating agent, also referred to as sequestrants, many of which also have anticalculus activity or tooth substantive activity. Use of chelating agents in oral care products is advantageous for their ability to complex calcium such as found in the cell walls of bacteria, to disrupt plaque and to complex with metallic ions. Chelation of ions, such as iron or copper, helps retard oxidative deterioration of finished products. In one embodiment, the chelating agent is selected from polyphosphates, polycarboxylates, polyvinvylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polymeric polyether, polymeric alkyl phosphate, copolymers of methyl vinyl ether and maleic anhydride, polyphosphonates, sodium alginate, carbonyl diphosphonates; acrylic acid polymers; polyvinyl pyrrolidone, copolymers of vinyl pyrrolidone with carboxylates, and mixtures thereof. The amount of chelating agent in the compositions will depend on the chelating agent used and typically will be from at least about 0.1% to about 20%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 10 % and more preferably from about 1.0% to about 7%. Suitable chelating agents include soluble phosphate compounds, such as phytates, linear polyphosphates having two or more phosphate groups, and other polyphosphorylated compounds, all discussed more fully below as tooth substantive agents.

In some embodiments, there may be mixtures or combinations of chelating agents. Tooth Substantive Agent The oral care active may include an effective amount of a tooth substantive agent. For purposes of this application, tooth substantive agents are included as chelants also. Suitable agents may be polymeric surface active agents (PMSA’s), including polyelectrolytes, more specifically anionic polymers. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that PMSA’s provide a stain prevention benefit because of their reactivity or substantivity to mineral or tooth surfaces, resulting in desorption of portions of undesirable adsorbed pellicle proteins, in particular those associated with binding color bodies that stain teeth, calculus development and attraction of undesirable microbial species. The retention of these PMSA’s on teeth can also prevent stains from accruing due to disruption of binding sites of color bodies on tooth surfaces. The PMSA’s include any agent which will have a strong affinity for the tooth surface, deposit a polymer layer or coating on the tooth surface and produce the desired surface modification effects. Suitable examples of such polymers are polyelectrolytes such as condensed phosphorylated polymers; polyphosphonates; copolymers of phosphate- or phosphonatecontaining monomers or polymers with other monomers such as ethylenically unsaturated monomers and amino acids or with other polymers such as proteins, polypeptides, polysaccharides, poly(acrylate), poly(acrylamide), poly(methacrylate), poly(ethacrylate), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(maleic anhydride), poly(maleate) poly(amide), poly(ethylene amine), poly(ethylene glycol), polypropylene glycol), poly(vinyl acetate) and poly(vinyl benzyl chloride); polycarboxylates and carboxy-substituted polymers; and mixtures thereof. Suitable polymeric mineral surface active agents include the carboxy-substituted alcohol polymers described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,292,501; 5,213,789, 5,093,170; 5,009,882; and 4,939,284; all to Degenhardt et al. and the diphosphonate-derivatized polymers in U.S. patent 5,011,913 to Benedict et al; the synthetic anionic polymers including polyacrylates and copolymers of maleic anhydride or acid and methyl vinyl ether (e.g., GANTREZ®), as described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,627,977, to Gaffar et al. A preferred polymer is diphosphonate modified polyacrylic acid. Polymers with end or side chain phosphate or phosphonate functions are preferred although other polymers with mineral binding activity may prove effective depending upon adsorption affinity. Additional examples of suitable phosphonate containing polymeric mineral surface active agents include the geminal diphosphonate polymers disclosed as anticalculus agents in US 4,877,603 to Degenhardt et al; phosphonate group containing copolymers disclosed in US 4,749,758 to Dursch et al. and in GB 1,290,724 (both assigned to Hoechst) suitable for use in detergent and cleaning compositions; and the copolymers and cotelomers disclosed as useful for applications including scale and corrosion inhibition, coatings, cements and ion-exchange resins in US 5,980,776 to Zakikhani et al. and US 6,071,434 to Davis et al. Additional polymers include the water-soluble copolymers of vinylphosphonic acid and acrylic acid and salts thereof disclosed in GB 1,290,724 wherein the copolymers contain from about 10% to about 90% by weight vinylphosphonic acid and from about 90% to about 10% by weight acrylic acid, more particularly wherein the copolymers have a weight ratio of vinylphosphonic acid to acrylic acid of 70% vinylphosphonic acid to 30% acrylic acid; 50% vinylphosphonic acid to 50% acrylic acid; or 30% vinylphosphonic acid to 70% acrylic acid. Other suitable polymers include the water soluble polymers disclosed by Zakikhani and Davis prepared by copolymerizing diphosphonate or polyphosphonate monomers having one or more unsaturated C=C bonds (e.g., vinylidene-l,l-diphosphonic acid and 2-(hydroxyphosphinyl)ethylidene-l,l-diphosphonic acid), with at least one further compound having unsaturated C=C bonds (e.g., acrylate and methacrylate monomers). Suitable polymers include the diphosphonate/acrylate polymers supplied by Rhodia under the designation ITC 1087 (Average MW 3000-60,000) and Polymer 1154 (Average MW 6000-55,000). One preferred PMSA is a polyphosphate. Although pyrophosphates (η=2) are technically polyphosphates, the polyphosphates desired are those having around three or more phosphate groups so that surface adsorption at effective concentrations produces sufficient non-bound phosphate functions, which enhance the anionic surface charge as well as hydrophilic character of the surfaces. The inorganic polyphosphate salts desired include tripolyphosphate, tetrapolyphosphate and hexametaphosphate, among others. Polyphosphates larger than tetrapolyphosphate usually occur as amorphous glassy materials. Preferred in the present compositions are the linear polyphosphates having the formula: XO(XP03)nX wherein X is sodium, potassium or ammonium and η averages from about 3 to about 125. Preferred polyphosphates are those having η averaging from about 6 to about 21, such as those commercially known as Sodaphos (η≈6), Hexaphos (η≈13), and Glass Η (η≈21) and manufactured by FMC Corporation and Astaris. These polyphosphates may be used alone or in combination. Polyphosphates are susceptible to hydrolysis in high water formulations at acid pH, particularly below pH 5. Thus it is preferred to use longer-chain polyphosphates, in particular Glass Η with an average chain length of about 21. It is believed such longer-chain polyphosphates when undergoing hydrolysis produce shorter-chain polyphosphates which are still effective to deposit onto teeth and provide a stain preventive benefit. Also useful as tooth substantive agents are nonpolymeric phosphate compounds, in particular polyphosphorylated inositol compounds such as phytic acid, myo-inositol pentakis(dihydrogen phosphate); myo-inositol tetrakis(dihydrogen phosphate), myo-inositol trikis(dihydrogen phosphate), and an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salt thereof. Preferred herein is phytic acid, also known as myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakis (dihydrogen phosphate) or inositol hexaphosphoric acid, and its alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salts. Herein, the term “phytate” includes phytic acid and its salts as well as the other polyphosphorylated inositol compounds. Other surface active phosphate compounds useful as tooth substantive agents include organophosphates such as phosphate mono-, di- or triesters such as described in commonly assigned application published as US20080247973A1. Examples include mono- di- and tri- alkyl and alkyl (poly)alkoxy phosphates such as dodecyl phosphate, lauryl phosphate; laureth-1 phosphate; laureth-3 phosphate; laureth-9 phosphate; dilaureth-10 phosphate; trilaureth-4 phosphate; C12-18 PEG-9 phosphate and salts thereof. Many are commercially available from suppliers including Croda; Rhodia; Nikkol Chemical; Sunjin; Α1ζο; Huntsman Chemical; Clariant and Cognis. Some preferred agents are polymeric, for example those containing repeating alkoxy groups as the polymeric portion, in particular 3 or more ethoxy, propoxy isopropoxy or butoxy groups. Additional suitable polymeric organophosphate agents include dextran phosphate, polyglucoside phosphate, alkyl polyglucoside phosphate, polyglyceryl phosphate, alkyl polyglyceryl phosphate, polyether phosphates and alkoxylated polyol phosphates.

Additional suitable non-polymeric phosphates include alkyl mono glyceride phosphate, alkyl sorbitan phosphate, alkyl methyl glucoside phosphate, alkyl sucrose phosphates. Other useful tooth substantive agents include siloxane polymers functionalized with carboxylic acid groups, such as disclosed in disclosed in US Patent Nos. 7,025,950 and 7,166,235 both assigned to The Procter & Gamble Co. Also useful as tooth substantive agents are water-soluble or water-dispersible polymeric agents prepared by copolymerizing one or a mixture of vinyl pyrrolidone (VP) monomers with one or a mixture of alkenyl carboxylate (AC) monomers, specifically C2-C12 alkenyl esters of saturated straight- or branched-chain Cl-Cl9 alkyl carboxylic acids described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,682,722. Examples include copolymers of vinyl pyrrolidone with one or a mixture of vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, or vinyl butyrate. Preferred polymers have an average molecular weight ranging from about 1,000 to about 1,000,000, preferably from 10,000 to 200,000, even more preferably from 30,000 to 100,000. The amount of tooth substantive agent will typically be from about 0.1% to about 35% by weight of the total oral care composition. In dentifrice formulations, the amount is preferably from about 2% to about 30%, more preferably from about 5% to about 25%, and most preferably from about 6% to about 20%.

GANTREZ S-95 (IUPAC Name: furan-2,5-dione; methoxyethene; CAS Number: 9067-41-8 ) is commercially available from Ashland Inc. Calculating Soluble Fluoride The soluble fluoride level of the formulations was calculated using the following methodology which provides a reproducible measure of the concentration of soluble fluoride in diluted dentifrice solutions. First, a 3:1 water : product slurry is prepared in which the dentifrice has been thoroughly dispersed. The slurry sample is centrifuged, forming a layer of supernatant. An aliquot of the supernatant is placed in an acid matrix with a hydroxide solution to prepare the test solution. The sample is then injected into an ion chromatograph using a custom column prepared by Hamilton for separation. Response is measured using a conductivity detector. Results are calculated using a quadratic calibration curve generated from a series of known fluoride standards. Calculating Soluble Stannous and Zinc The soluble stannous and/or zinc level of the formulations was calculated using the following methodology which provides a reproducible measure of the concentration of soluble stannous and/or zinc in diluted dentifrice solutions. First, a 3:1 water : product slurry is prepared in which the dentifrice has been thoroughly dispersed. The slurry sample is centrifuged, forming a layer of supernatant. An aliquot of the supernatant is placed in an acid matrix with a hydroxide solution to prepare the test solution. The solution is analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and tin and zinc are determined by an external calibration curve. Results for tin and zinc are reported as ppm (pg/g) in the supernatant. Percent compatibility is calculated by deducting the analyzed from initial values. (Compatibility of abrasives such as fused and precipitated silicas in formulations with stannous and fluroride is also discussed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2010/0135924Α1).
