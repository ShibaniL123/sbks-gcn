Step 2: (S)-8-Chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
Water (2 ml) and acetic acid (3 ml) were pre-mixed and added to the flask containing (R)-2-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-8-chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (0.280 g, 0.467 mmol). To help to dissolve the starting material the flask was sonicated 5-10 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight and followed by LC/MS. It was concentrated in vacuo at a bath temperature of 26Â° C. and vacuum of 20 mbar. The majority of the acetic acid was removed and the remaining aqueous solution was cooled in an ice bath and diluted with EtOAc. Slowly a 10% aqueous sodium carbonate solution was added until pH 7. The layers were separated and the organic phase was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (0-10% MeOH in DCM) to give the title compound with 97% ee (0.15 g, 72% yield) (around 3% regioisomer formation of example 9 was observed).
Alternatively, example 1 can be prepared by the following procedures:
