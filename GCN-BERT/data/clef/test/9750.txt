(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-{[(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methyl]amino}-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid
Example 27A
(2S,3S,4S,5S)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-4-(((5-(tert-butyl)-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methyl)amino)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate
(2S,3S,4S,5S)-Ethyl 4-amino-3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Example 7B, 1.393 g) and 5-(tert-butyl)-2-methoxynicotinaldehyde (0.068 g, 0.352 mmol) were stirred in methanol (3.5 mL) at room temperature for 1 hour. Sodium cyanoborohydride (0.111 g, 1.759 mmol) was then added in one portion, and the reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then concentrated in vacuo, and then the remaining residue was taken up in CH2Cl2 and water. The phases were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted twice more with CH2Cl2. The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo, and the resulting crude residue was purified by silica gel chromatography, eluting with 0 to 20% ethyl acetate-heptanes to provide the title compound 0.127 g, (63% yield).
