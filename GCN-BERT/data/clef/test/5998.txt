EXAMPLES The present invention will be illustrated specifically by examples and comparative examples below, but the present invention is not limited to them. The surface resistance (Ω/□) of the conductive film was measured using a resistivity meter (manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Loresta GP MCP-T610 type). Synthesis Example 1 Synthesis of Ionic Compound P-1 2,7-dibromo-9-fluorenone (52.5 g), ethyl salicylate (154.8 g) and mercaptoacetic acid (1.4 g) were added into a 300 mL flask, the gas in the flask was purged with a nitrogen gas. To this was added methanesulfonic acid (630 mL), and the mixture was stirred at 75° C. overnight. The resultant mixture was left to cool, and added into ice water and stirred for 1 hour. The resultant solid was separated by filtration, and washed with heated acetonitrile. The washed solid was dissolved in acetone, a solid was re-crystallized from the resultant acetone solution, and separated by filtration. The solid obtained above (62.7 g), 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxyl)ethoxy]-p-toluenesulfonate (86.3 g), potassium carbonate (62.6 g) and 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane (referred to also as “18-crown-6” in some cases) (7.2 g) were dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide (referred to as “DMF” in some cases) (670 mL), the resultant solution was transferred into a flask and stirred at 105° C. overnight. The resultant mixture was left to cool to room temperature, and added into ice water and stirred for 1 hour. To the resultant reaction solution was added chloroform (300 mL) and liquid separation and extraction were performed, and the resultant organic phase was concentrated, to obtain 2,7-dibromo-9,9-bis[3-ethoxycarbonyl-4-[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxyl)ethoxy]ethoxy]phenyl]-fluorene (compound D) (51.2 g). A nitrogen gas atmosphere was prepared in a flask, then, the compound D (15 g), bis(pinacolato)diboron (8.9 g), [1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) dichloromethane complex (0.8 g), 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (0.5 g), potassium acetate (9.4 g) and dioxane (400 mL) were added, heated at 110° C., and refluxed with heating for 10 hours. After left to cool, the resultant reaction solution was filtrated, and the resultant filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resultant residue was washed with methanol three times, dissolved in toluene, to the resultant solution was added activated carbon and the mixture was stirred. Thereafter, filtration was performed, and the resultant filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, to obtain 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-bis[3-ethoxycarbonyl-4-[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxyl)ethoxy]ethoxy]phenyl]-fluorene (compound E) (11.7 g). An inert gas atmosphere was prepared in a flask, then, the compound D (0.55 g), the compound E (0.61 g), triphenylphosphinepalladium (0.01 g), methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride (manufactured by Sigma Aldrich, trade name Aliquat336 (registered trademark)) (0.20 g) and toluene (10 mL) were added, and heated at 105° C. Into the resultant reaction solution, a 2M sodium carbonate aqueous solution (6 mL) was dropped, and the mixture was refluxed for 8 hours. To the resultant reaction solution was added 4-tert-butylphenylboronic acid (0.01 g) and the mixture was refluxed for 6 hours. Thereafter, to this was added a sodium diethyldithiacarbamate aqueous solution (10 mL, concentration: 0.05 g/mL) and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours. The resultant mixed solution was dropped into methanol (300 mL) and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour, then, the deposited precipitate was filtrated, dried under reduced pressure for 2 hours, and dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL). The resultant solution was dropped into a mixed solvent of methanol (120 mL) and a 3 wt % acetic acid aqueous solution (50 mL) and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour, then, the deposited precipitate was filtrated, and dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL). The resultant solution was dropped into methanol (200 mL) and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, then, the deposited precipitate was filtrated, to obtain a solid. The resultant solid was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, and purified by passing through an alumina column and a silica gel column. The tetrahydrofuran solution recovered from the column was concentrated, then, dropped into methanol (200 mL), and the deposited solid was filtrated, and dried. The yield of the resultant poly[9,9-bis[3-ethoxycarbonyl-4-bis[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxyl)ethoxy]ethoxy]phenyl]-fluorene] (compound F) was 520 mg. The compound F had a polystyrene-equivalent number-average molecular weight of 5.2×104. The compound F is composed of a constitutional unit represented by the following formula, according to the result of NMR. The compound F (200 mg) was placed in a 100 mL flask, and the gas in the flask was purged with a nitrogen gas. Thereafter, to this were added tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) and ethanol (20 mL), and the resultant mixture was heated up to 55° C. Thereafter, an aqueous solution prepared by dissolving cesium hydroxide (200 mg) in water (2 mL) was added to this, and the mixture was stirred at 55° C. for 6 hours. The resultant mixture was cooled down to room temperature, then, the reaction solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The resultant solid was washed with water, and dried under reduced pressure, to obtain a pale yellow solid (150 mg, cesium salt of compound F, hereinafter, referred to as “ionic compound P-1”). It was confirmed according to the NMR spectrum that a signal derived from an ethyl group at an ethyl ester portion in the compound F disappeared completely. The ionic compound P-1 is composed of a constitutional unit represented by the following formula. The polystyrene-equivalent number-average molecular weight of the ionic compound P-1 was identical to that of the compound F. Example 1 Fabrication of Conductive Film F-1 With respect to 1.0 part by weight of silver acetate, 0.1 part by weight of the ionic compound P-1 (namely, 10 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of silver compound), 0.5 parts by weight of ethylene glycol (corresponding to reducing agent), 1.0 part by weight of 1,2-ethylenediamine (EDA) and 10.0 parts by weight of 1-butanol were mixed, to prepare an ink composition for forming a conductive film.
