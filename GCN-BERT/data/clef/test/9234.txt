The present invention relates to prosthetic devices and, more specifically, to a system and method for replication of angular position of an articulating head of a prosthesis. The invention has particular application to the humeral component of a shoulder prosthesis. Repair and replacement of human joints, such as the knee, shoulder, elbow and hip, has become a more and more frequent medical treatment. Longer life spans mean that the joints endure more wear and tear. More sports activities mean greater likelihood of serious joint injuries. Treatment of injuries, wear and disease in human joints has progressed from the use of orthotics to mask the problem, to fusion of the joint, to the use of prostheses to replace the damaged joint component(s). As the success rate for total or partial joint replacements has increased, so too has the need for modularity and universality in the joint prosthesis. Patient variety means that no single size or configuration of joint prosthesis will suffice. The physical dimensions of a patient's joint components vary, as well as the bio-mechanic relationship between these components. For instance, in a shoulder prosthesis, the relationship between the articulating humeral and glenoid components can be significantly different between patients. These relationships are especially important where only one component of the joint is being replaced and must integrate with the existing natural opposing joint component. For instance, in many shoulder surgeries, only the humeral component is replaced, leaving the glenoid component intact. In this case, it is imperative that the articulating surface of the humeral component match the articulating surface of the glenoid component as perfectly as possible, both statically and dynamically. With a typical humeral prosthesis, version and inclination are adjusted by the geometry of the head of the prosthesis. In other words, certain pre-determined head geometries are available that can be selected for a mating glenoid component. Absent an infinite variety of pre-determined head geometries, the resulting humeral prosthesis can often only achieve a best-fit relationship to the glenoid component of the shoulder joint. Presently, two strategies are available to a surgeon for shoulder replacement surgery. One strategy is to perform the shoulder replacement surgery in accordance with the design of a particular manufacturer's shoulder prosthesis or shoulder prosthesis product line. In this case, a surgeon is provided with instrumentation and technique guidelines for the particular shoulder prosthesis or prosthesis line. The guidelines and/or instrumentation direct or dictate the angle of humeral head resection for the implant (prosthesis). This angle is in relation to the humeral intramedullary canal and is designed to match an optimum set of angles already present in the design of the prosthesis. Another approach is to perform the shoulder replacement surgery in accordance with the patient's anatomy. Particularly, the humeral head is resected according to angles perceived to be "anatomic" in the opinion of the surgeon, not according to angles already present in the prosthesis itself. With this approach, the prosthesis is designed so that its configuration is intraoperatively adjustable. This allows the prosthesis to be adjustable in situ so that it can match the bony preparation. Even with respect to these two divergent manners of surgical strategy, a common problem in shoulder surgery is matching the humeral resection angle across the articular margin to the predetermined angle designed into the prosthesis. This angle may include the angle between a prosthetic collar and the diaphyseal section of the stem. In the case of a collarless stem, the angle may inscribe the difference between the longitudinal axis of the stem and the inferior surface of the prosthetic head. It is considered optimal for fixation and biomechanics if the resected angle and the angle of the prosthesis are identical, thereby allowing intimate contact between the superior surface of the resected bone and the inferior surface of the implant. Moreover, the angular version in which the prosthesis is implanted will have a significant impact on the biomechanics of the prosthetic joint. Many shoulder prosthesis systems on the market dictate the varus/valgus angle of the bone cut. This strategy does not allow the surgeon to intraoperatively match the implant to the patient's biomechanics after the prosthesis has been trialed, much less implanted. There are two known products currently marketed that attempt to resolve at least one of the above-noted issues. First, the system which is sold by Tomier S A under the trade mark Aequalis provides a modular junction within the metaphyseal region of the stem which allows a small block between the stem and humeral head to be interchanged. This block is available in multiple angles, thus allowing the surgeon to select the block that best fits the bony anatomy as resected. This system, however, has two primary weaknesses. First, the use of modular blocks obviously forces the design to only allow angular adjustments in finite increments. Second, the need to adjust the angle through modular blocks forces the surgeon to remove the stem, change out a component, and reset the stem. A second commercially available product provides a humeral head that is infinitely adjustable in varus/valgus and anterior/posterior angles relative to the stem portion of the prosthesis. This is accomplished through a spherical shaped protrusion on the superior surface of the stem that fits into a spherical recess in the humeral head. These mating surfaces allow the head to be articulated about the stem, thus allowing adjustable positioning of the head. The head can be locked in a position relative to the stem. This solution provides the ability to adjust the neck-shaft angle as well as the version through flexibility in the anterior/posterior angle. The locking mechanism, however, is sub-optimal since it requires the turning of a locking screw that has its head facing lateral and inferior, for which there is no access once the stem has been cemented. This eliminates the ability to adjust head position on the fly, and forces a total revision if articular surfaces ever need to be revised. Lastly, the protrusion on the humeral stem even when the humeral head is not in place limits the surgeon's access to the glenoid in preparation for a glenoid replacement. An improvement to this latter product places an adjustable mounting element between the stem and the humeral head. The mounting element is configured for articulating engagement with the stem to permit angular positioning of the head component in multiple degrees of freedom. Details of this prosthesis are disclosed in US-A-2005/0143829. As disclosed in US-A-2005/0143829, the humeral head is fixed to the mounting element by a press-fit engagement. The mounting element is fastened to the humeral stem by two mechanisms. In the first mechanism, the mounting element achieves a friction fit with a tapered bore in the neck of the humeral stem. The second fixation mechanism includes a screw that is threaded into a threaded bore portion of the tapered bore in the stem. The screw bears against the mounting element to lock the element in position within the tapered bore. The joint prosthesis disclosed in US-A-2005/0143829 is both modular and universal in that it permits infinitely variable positioning of a mating joint component relative to a bone engaging portion of the prosthesis. Moreover, this improved prosthesis is readily available for modification, whether during initial implantation or during a subsequent revision procedure. With shoulder prostheses that allow a surgeon to adjust the angular position of the humeral head, such as those described above, a method must be available for trialing the prosthesis. When the trial prosthesis is implanted, several adjustments may be made to set the angular position of the prosthetic head relative to the humeral stem. In a typical trialing system, the trial prosthesis includes a broach configured to be tightly received within a previously prepared intramedullary (IM) canal of the humerus. In current systems, an articulating element is oriented relative to the neck of the broach and locked in place by a press-fit taper. Locking the articulating trial element thus requires impaction of the element within the broach. This method produces galling of the broach which can significantly limit the useful life of the broach. Moreover, the impaction step frequently causes the trial broach to sink further into the IM canal. This displacement of the trial broach results in an indeterminate offset of the centre of rotation of the trial element. In addition, discrepancies between the amount of impaction of the trial element vis-Ã -vis the final implant element results in an unknown offset of this centre of rotation, which ultimately leads to a poor anatomic fit and improper alignment of the humeral head prosthesis. DE-C-10123517 discloses a shoulder joint prosthesis which includes an expandable connector portion between the stem part and the articulating head part. The connector portion has a tapered bore which receives an expansion bolt. In one aspect, the present invention provides a trial implant as defined in claim 1 The trialing system of the invention has the advantage that it can ensure accurate duplication of the angles of the trial implant without using impaction to fix the trial components. Preferably, the expandable portion of the mounting element includes an expanding ball and a bore within the ball. In one feature of these embodiments, mating portions of the expansion element and the bore define a rotational engagement so that rotation of the expansion element drives the expansion element into the bore. In addition, the expansion element and the bore include cooperating portions that cooperate to expand the ball when the expansion element is driven into the bore. In a more specific embodiment, the bore is a tapered threaded bore and the expansion element is a screw configured to be threaded into the threaded bore. Alternatively, the screw can be tapered to expand the bore and the ball. In another specific embodiment, the mating portions define a threaded engagement and the cooperating portions include a tapered portion of the bore and a peg on the expansion element sized to expand the tapered portion when the expansion element is driven into the bore. Preferably, the expanding ball includes a first ball portion adjacent the portion of the mounting element configured to support the articulating component defining a first spherical diameter. The ball portion further includes a second ball portion attached to the first ball portion and defining a second spherical diameter smaller than the first spherical diameter. Preferably, the cavity in the stem includes an annular rim extending into the cavity. The annular rim defines an inner diameter that is less than the outer diameter of the expandable portion of the mounting element in both its un-expanded and expanded states. The expandable portion has a contracted state that defines an outer diameter less than the inner diameter of the rim so that the expandable portion can be inserted past the rim into the cavity. Once past the rim, the expandable portion may assume its un-expanded configuration in which the portion is trapped within the cavity but still movable to various angular orientations. Preferably, the annular rim defines an inner diameter and the expandable portion defines an expanded diameter in the expanded configuration that is greater than the inner diameter. Moreover, the expandable portion has an unexpanded configuration defining a diameter greater than the inner diameter to retain the expandable portion within the cavity. In yet another aspect of this embodiment, the expandable portion has a compressed configuration defining a diameter that is less than the inner diameter to permit passage of the expandable portion past the annular rim into the cavity. Preferably, the expandable portion includes an expanding ball and an expansion element extending into the expanding ball and configured to expand the ball to the expanded configuration. The expanding ball may define a tapered threaded bore and the expansion element is a screw configured to be threaded into the threaded bore. In a preferred embodiment, the expanding ball includes a first ball portion arranged to contact the annular rim and the side wall when the expandable portion is expanded within the cavity and defining a first spherical diameter. The expanding ball further includes a second ball portion connected to the first ball portion and arranged to contact the base of the cavity when the expandable portion is expanded within the cavity and defining a second spherical diameter less than the first spherical diameter. The apparatus of the invention can be used in a method for establishing an angular orientation of an articulating component of an implant for the joint of a patient relative to a stem component configured for placement within a bone of a patient, comprising the steps of: providing a trial mounting assembly for mounting the articulating component to the stem component, the trial mounting assembly having an expandable portion configured to expand within a cavity defined in the stem component;disposing the expandable portion within the cavity in the stem component;introducing an expansion element into the expandable portion;rotating the expansion element relative to the expandable portion to drive the expansion element into the expandable portion causing the expandable portion to expand within the cavity. The apparatus of the invention can be used in a method for establishing an angular orientation of an articulating component of an implant for the joint of a patient relative to a stem component configured for placement within a bone of a patient, and comprises the steps of: providing a trial mounting assembly for mounting the articulating component to the stem component, the trial mounting assembly having an expandable portion configured to expand within a cavity defined in the stem component;disposing the expandable portion within the cavity in the stem component;expanding the expandable portion within the cavity so that the expandable portion contacts the cavity at three points of contact. The trial system of the invention can be used to obtain the angular orientation of an articulating component for a joint prosthesis. The system that does not require impaction to fix the trial components in their proper angular orientation. The invention will now be discussed in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a side view of a humeral implant for a shoulder prosthesis.FIG. 2 is an enlarged partial cross-section view of a trial assembly.FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a ball cylinder of the trial assembly shown in FIG. 2.FIG. 4 is a bottom view of the ball cylinder shown FIG. 3.FIG. 5 is an enlarged partial cross-section view of the interface between the ball cylinder of FIG. 2 and the neck of a trial broach.FIG. 6 is an enlarged cross-section view of an alternative construction of the mounting cavity for receiving the trial ball cylinder.FIG. 7 is an enlarged cross-section view of a ball cylinder according to the invention for use with the humeral implant shown in FIG. 1.FIG. 8 is a side view of a replication instrument for use in replicating the angular orientation of the ball cylinder in the trial assembly of the present invention. The invention is described below with reference to a shoulder joint prosthesis, and particularly the humeral component of the prosthesis. However, the invention can be used in relation to other joints or bone interfaces of the body. The common feature among these alternative uses of the invention is that they include components that can assume a range of angular orientations relative to each other. Those angular orientations should be duplicated from a trial implant or prosthesis to a final implant. Constructions are shown in the drawings which do not necessarily form part of the invention and are included in the specification to facilitate understanding of the invention. Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows a humeral prosthesis 10 for use in a shoulder joint replacement. The prosthesis includes a stem 12 configured to be disposed within the prepared IM canal of the humerus bone. Where the prosthesis 10 is a final implant, the stem is configured for permanent implantation within the IM canal, often accompanied by the introduction of bone cement into the canal. Where the prosthesis 10 is a trial implant, the prosthesis may be a broach that combines its function as a bone working tool to prepare the bore in the IM canal with its function as a trial stem. The prosthesis 10 includes a neck 13 that is angled relative to the stem but arranged to sit flush with the resected head of the humerus bone when the prosthesis is implanted. An articulating head component 16, or humeral head for a shoulder prosthesis, is supported on the stem 12 by a mounting assembly 18. Where the prosthesis is a final prosthesis, the mounting assembly is configured for a final fixation, such as by impaction into a cavity 20 in the neck 13 of the stem. Where the prosthesis 10 is a trial broach, the mounting assembly 18 can be constructed according to the present invention disclosed herein. In order to achieve a joint prosthesis that emulates the natural joint as closely as possible, the articulating component 16 is infinitely positionable. Where the prosthesis 10 is a humeral prosthesis, the humeral head component 16 must be variably angularly positionable in the medial-lateral M-L rotation and superior inferior S-I rotation degrees of freedom. In a typical shoulder joint, the humeral head will be positioned at an angle of 135 Â° to the axis of the humerus bone. However, normal variations in patient anatomy can yield humeral head angles of 120Â° to 150Â°. Thus, a universal humeral prosthesis 10 will be capable of 15 Â° variations in all angular directions from the mean datum line D passing perpendicular to the platform surface 14 of the neck 13. The neck 13 of the stem 12 includes a superior positioning groove 22 and a pair of inferior positioning grooves 24. As explained in more detail herein, these grooves establish the position of the trial and final implants in a replication instrument, serving as a means to provide a repeatable orientation for the datum line D relative to which the humeral head angular orientation is established. A trial assembly 30 that does not require impaction of the trial components is depicted in FIG. 2. The assembly 30 includes a trial ball cylinder 32 having a cylinder portion 34 and an expanding ball portion 36. The cylinder portion 34 defines an outer surface 38 that is received within a mating recess 17 formed in the humeral head component 16. Preferably, the cylinder portion and mating recess form a tight fit, but not a press-fit engagement so that no impaction of the trial assembly 30 is required. The cylinder portion 34 can be provided with an alignment notch 65 to receive a tab 66 formed on the interior of the mating recess 17 in the humeral head. The notch and tab interlock to ensure that the trial ball cylinder 32 rotates and pivots with the humeral head as the head is manipulated within the patient's shoulder joint to find the optimum fit with the glenoid aspect of the joint. The trial ball cylinder defines an inner cavity 40 which provides access to a tapered bore 45. The tapered bore is coincident with expansion slots 42 formed in the expanding ball portion 36. Preferably, four such expansion slots 42 are provided, as best seen in FIG. 4. The slots are configured in a conventional manner to allow the radial or diametrical expansion of the ball portion 32 as an expansion element is driven into the tapered bore 45. Preferably, the expansion element is an expansion screw 48 with a uniform diameter threaded stem 49 that is threaded into internal threads 46 of the tapered bore. The screw 48 includes a head portion 50 that is preferably larger than the threaded stem 49 so the head portion contacts the angled portion 41 (FIG. 3) of the cavity to limit the passage of the screw into the bore. The head portion may be provided with an internal hex recess to receive a known hex driving tool for screwing the expansion element 48 into the tapered threaded bore 45. It should be readily understood that as the expansion screw 48 is threaded into the tapered bore 45, the threaded stem 49 causes the walls of the bore to expand outward, thereby opening each of the expansion slots 42 (as shown in FIG. 5). In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention, the expansion element 48 is a screw driven into a tapered bore. Alternatively, the bore 45 in the expanding ball portion 36 can have a uniform diameter and the expansion screw can incorporate a tapered threaded stem. Regardless of which component is tapered or uniform, a screw-threaded bore interface is a preferred mechanism to enlarge the expanding ball portion 36 since it relies upon the application of torque rather than on an impact force to drive the expansion element 48 into the bore 45. Other expansion elements are contemplated that rely upon the application of a torque or rotational force to expand the slots 42 in the ball portion 36. In accordance with one feature of the trial assembly 30, the expanding ball portion 36 is configured so that the centre of rotation C (FIGS. 2 and 5) will automatically substantially coincide with the centre of rotation of the final implant. Ideally, this centre of rotation C is fixed relative to the humerus bone when either the trial broach or the final implant is engaged with the IM canal. Maintaining this reference point constant ensures that the replicated angle of the humeral head in the final implant is anatomically accurate and appropriate for the patient's shoulder joint anatomy. As is apparent, the expanding ball portion 36 of the trial ball cylinder 32 is sized to freely slide in and out of the mounting cavity 20 formed in the neck 13 of the trial broach. Thus, unless the expanding ball portion is properly positioned and constrained, the centre of rotation C can shift up and down and radially side to side within the cavity. The expanding ball portion is positively positioned and constrained at three points of contact within the cavity 20. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the expanding ball portion includes a larger ball portion 54 and a smaller ball portion 56 projecting from a truncated base 55 (FIGS. 1 and 5) of the larger ball portion. The two ball portions share their origin with the centre of rotation C. The smaller ball portion 56 is provided to reduce the overall height of the expanding ball portion 36, which translates into a minimized depth for the mounting cavity 20. As can be seen in FIG. 1, the size of the neck 13 limits the depth for the mounting cavity 20. On the other hand, strength, stability and accuracy considerations suggest an optimum diameter for the expanding ball portion, and particularly for the larger ball portion 54. If the entire expanding ball portion 36 were formed at the same diameter as the larger ball portion, the cavity 20 would have to be deeper to accommodate the ball portion, which necessarily would exceed the structural limit for the cavity. Thus, truncating the larger diameter ball portion 54 and integrating the smaller diameter ball portion 56 sufficiently reduces the height of the expanding ball portion so that the cavity can fall within the preferred depth limits discussed above. The mounting cavity 20 includes a radial lip or ring 62 at the opening of the cavity adjacent the platform surface 14. As the ball portion 36 expands, the larger ball portion 54 contacts this lip at point P1. It is understood that this point P1 represents a circumferential line of contact between the spherical ball portion 54 and the cylindrical cavity 20. As the larger ball portion 54 expands further into the lip 62, the reaction pushes the ball portion 36 deeper into the cavity 20 until the smaller ball portion 56 bottoms on the cavity base 58 at point P2. Again, it is understood that the point of contact P2 represents a circumferential line of contact between the spherical ball portion 56 and the flat base 58, broken at 90Â° intervals by the gaps formed by the expanded slots 42. Further expansion of the larger ball portion 54 stops with the portion contacts the cavity side wall 60 at the circumferential point of contact P3. These three points of contact P1, P2, and P3 fix the location of the centre of rotation C and provide a solid engagement of the ball portion 36 within the cavity 20. The larger ball portion 54 is formed with a spherical diameter of 9.25 mm (0.364 inch), while the smaller ball portion has a spherical diameter of 8.0 mm (0.314 inch). The expansion slots 42 have a width of 0.64 mm (0.025 inch). The expansion slots also accommodate compression of the ball portion 36 so that the inner diameter of the lip 62 can be smaller than the spherical diameter of the larger ball portion. In other words, the cylindrical wall 60 of the cavity 20 is formed at a diameter of about 9.5 mm (0.375 inch), which is greater than the largest diameter of the expanding ball portion 36. The lip 62 projects inward from the cavity side wall 60 at an inner diameter of about 9.0 mm (0.355 inch), which is less than the diameter of the larger ball portion 54. When the slots 42 are fully compressed, the diameter of the larger ball portion decreases by about one half of the slot width, or by about 0.30 mm (0.012 inch). This reduced outer diameter of 8.94 (0.352 inch) is less than the inner diameter of the lip so that compressed ball portion can slide past the lip 62 and into the cavity 20. Once inside, the ball portion 36 is restored to its normal size so that the cylinder portion 34 is loosely retained on the trial broach 12. The lip 62 is integrally formed within the cavity 20, such as by machining an undercut in the trial broach 12. Alternatively, the circumferential lip can be created by a snap-ring 68 mounted within a groove 69 adjacent the platform surface 14, as shown in FIG. 6. The snap-ring projects inward into the interior of the cavity to define an inner diameter comparable to the inner diameter of the lip 62 shown in FIG. 5. The snap ring preferably bottoms within the groove so that there is no variation in the inner diameter defined by the ring, which is important to ensure proper positioning of the centre of rotation C. In the construction shown in FIGS. 2-4, the expanding ball portion 36 relies upon a tapered threaded bore and an expansion screw to expand the ball portion and lock it within the cavity. In an alternative construction, a peg and cam approach is used to expand the ball portion. As shown in FIG. 7, a trial assembly 70 includes a trial ball cylinder 72 having a cylindrical portion 74 and an expanding ball portion 76. The cylindrical portion 74 has an outer surface 78 that is adapted to mate with the bore 17 in the humeral head component 16. The cylindrical portion also defines an inner cavity 80 and the ball portion 76 includes expansion slots 82 similar to the prior embodiment. In this embodiment, the cavity 80 opens into a bore 85 passing through the expanding ball portion 76. The upper portion of the bore bears internal threads 86, while the lower portion of the bore defines a circumferential cam surface 87. As can be seen in FIG. 7, the cam surface is inwardly curved relative to the bore 85. The expansion element is a screw 88 having an upper threaded portion 89 configured to mate with the internal threads 86. A hex recess 90 accepts a hex driving tool to thread the expansion element into the bore. The lower portion of the screw 88 defines a peg 92 that bears against the cam surface 87 as the screw is driven into the bore. In the preferred embodiment, the peg is tapered, as shown in FIG. 7. As the peg traverses the cam surface it expands the surface, and ultimately expands the slots 82 in the same manner as described above to lock the ball portion 76 within the cavity 20. The trial assembly of the invention allows a full range of articulation or rotation of the trial components, and more specifically the trial head component 16. The expanding ball portions 36, 76 positively establish the centre of rotation C, which coincides with the origins for the larger and smaller spherical ball portions. As with other trial implants, the trial broach 10 is positioned within the prepared IM canal with the platform surface 14 aligned with the resected surface of the humerus bone. The trial ball cylinder 32 is then positioned within the mounting cavity 20. The three-dimensional angle of the trial cylinder relative to the broach stem can be adjusted with the trial humeral head 16 mounted on the cylinder portion 34. Once the trial head is properly oriented relative to the glenoid aspect of the shoulder joint, the expansion element 48, 88 is tightened using an appropriate tool. The mating bore 17 of the trial head 16 preferably passes through the head so that the expansion element can be accessed by the driving tool with the trial head in position on the cylinder portion. The interdigitating notch 65 and tab 66 help hold the trial head in position as the head is manipulated and the expansion element tightened. It is an advantage that the expansion element can be tightened within the expanding ball portion without the application of an impaction force. In the preferred embodiment, the expansion element is tightened by applying torque or a rotational force to the element. Most preferably, a threaded interface is provided between the expansion element and the expanding ball portion so that the amount of tightening torque can be controlled. In an alternative approach, the rotational interface can be in the form of a bayonet engagement in which the expansion element is rotated through a fixed angle and mating cam surfaces propel the expansion end of the element into the bore of the expanding ball portion. With this alternative, the amount of rotation of the expansion element is calibrated so that the ball portion expands enough to ensure a solid fixation within the mounting cavity. Once the angular orientation of the trial ball cylinder 32, 72 has been established, the entire trial broach is removed from the humerus bone. The trial assembly 30, 70 may then be mounted within a replication instrument to ascertain the angular position of the prosthetic head relative to the fixed datum D and established centre of rotation C. Any replication instrument may be used to ascertain this orientation and translate that position to a final prosthesis. One example of a replication instrument 100 shown in FIG. 8 is particularly suited for use with the trial assemblies 30 and 70 described above. Details of this instrument are disclosed in US-A-2005/0288681. The instrument 100 includes a base assembly 102 that carries a stationary clamp element 104 and a movable clamp element 106. An adjustment mechanism 108 may be manually operated to move the movable clamp element toward the stationary element 104. As explained above, the neck 13 of the trial broach 10 (as well as the final humeral implant) is provided with positioning grooves 22 and 24. The superior groove 22 accepts the fixed clamp element 104, while the pair of inferior grooves 24 are configured to mate with the movable clamp element 106. When the neck of the trial broach is engaged by the clamp elements 104, 106, the position of the datum D is fixed at a known orientation. The replication instrument 100 further includes a replication fixture 110 that is mounted on the base assembly 102. The fixture includes a platform 112 with legs 114 that are supported on the base assembly. The platform 110 includes an annular dome 116 which supports a spherical washer 118 on one surface and a cannulated guide member 120 on the opposite surface. The guide member includes a hollow stem portion 121 that passes through the dome 116 and washer 118. The stem portion 121 is threaded to receive a locking nut 122 to fix the angular orientation of the guide member 120 relative to the datum D. The guide member 120 cannula allows passage of an alignment tool 125, and more particularly the guide shaft 127 of the tool. The distal end of the guide shaft is sized to fit snugly within the cavity 40, 80 of the cylinder portion 34, 74. When the guide shaft 127 is situated within the cylinder portion of the trial assembly, the guide member 120 and spherical washer 118 assume a corresponding spatial angle relative to the dome 116. At this point in the method, the locking nut is tightened, thereby fixing the three-dimensional angular position of the guide member 120. The replication fixture 110 is then removed and the trial broach 10 released from the base assembly. The final humeral prosthesis is then clamped within the base assembly with a final head mounting assembly loosely engaged to the final implant stem. The alignment tool is reinserted into the guide member and the guide shaft is engaged with the mounting assembly to replicate the angular orientation of the trial ball cylinder 32, 72. The alignment tool 125 is configured with an impaction end 129 that can be struck with a mallet to impact the final implant mounting assembly within the final implant stem. Once the humeral head is impacted onto the mounting assembly, the prosthesis is ready to be implanted in the humerus bone. It is an advantage of the invention that all of the impaction steps occur outside the patient's body and with the use of separate fixtures. Thus, the invention allows for highly accurate replication of the appropriate anatomic angle for the humeral head relative to the humerus and glenoid aspects of the shoulder joint. These same principles can be used for other joint prostheses where the angle of an articulating component is critical.
