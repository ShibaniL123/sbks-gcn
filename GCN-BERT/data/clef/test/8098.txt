Intermediate 15: 1, 2-Diamino-5-bromopyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate
To a cooled (−5° C.) mixture of TFA (18.0 mL, 235 mmol) and water (2.5 mL) was added ethyl (1E)-N-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)sulfonyloxyethanimidate (12.4 g, 43.4 mmol) and the mixture was maintained at −5° C. for 1.5 h. Ice cold water (30 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with DCM (20 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and added to an ice-cold solution of 5-bromopyridin-2-amine (5.0 g, 29 mmol) in DCM (20 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h at rt. To the crude reaction mixture was added diethyl ether (30 mL) and the resulting white precipitate was filtered and washed with ether to provide the title compound (4.5 g, 40%).
