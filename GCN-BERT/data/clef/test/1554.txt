Step C: Ethyl 7-chloro-6-(difluoromethyl)-4-methyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5 -a]pyridine-3-carboxylate. To a solution of 2-chloro-3-(difluoromethyl)-5-methylpyridin-1-ium-1-amine; 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (5.1 g, 13 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (70 mL) was added ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoro-2-butynoate (1.85 mL, 12.9 mmol) and triethylamine (1.81 mL, 13 mmol) at 0° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h. To the reaction mixture was added 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (2.9 g, 12.8 mmol) at 0° C. and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was poured into water (500 mL). The precipitate was collected and washed with water (2×50 mL). Purification (FCC, SiO2, eluting with n-hexane:dichloromethane (2:1)) afforded the title compound (2.60 g, 7.29 mmol, 56%) as a white crystalline solid.
