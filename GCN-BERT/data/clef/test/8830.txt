Preparation of compound 19-d.
Compound 19-e (1.2 g, 4.35 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL) and then ammonia (50 mL, 7 M in methanol), was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was added to water (50 mL), a solid was precipitated and filtered. The filter cake was washed with water (50 mL) and dried in vacuo to deliver a yellow solid 19-d (1.5 g, yield: 100%). This product was used directly for the next step without further purification.
