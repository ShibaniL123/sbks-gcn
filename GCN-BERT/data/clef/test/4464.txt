BACKGROUND 1.Technical Field The present disclosure relates generally to surgical instruments and,more particularly,to a laser ablation instrument having a fiber optic output tip which utilizes a micro-prism structure to deliver a uniform radial distribution pattern. 2.Background of Related Art Laser-based instruments are becoming increasingly accepted in the medical field for use in minimally invasive procedures such as laser laparoscopy.For example,laser therapy is a widely accepted modality for tissue ablation procedures.Laser-based instruments are known to utilize fiber optic cables to deliver laser energy from the laser light source to targeted tissue. Fiber optic cables are composed of one or more transparent glass or plastic fibers through which light is efficiently conducted with minimal loss.The light-conducting fibers,called the core,are encased in a second medium,called the cladding layer,which has an index of refraction lower than that of the core to provide total internal reflection of the rays propagating though the core.That is,light traveling through the fiber bounces at shallow angles and stays completely within the fiber because light hits the interface between the core and cladding at an angle less than the critical angle.At these angles,light does not pass through to the second medium,but rather,continues reflecting within the core until it reaches the terminus,or end of the fiber. Asurgeon who performs procedures using existing laser-based instruments is often challenged with non-uniform temperature distribution, because laser dispersion through the fiber terminus radiates from a point source at the instrument tip in a generally conical pattern,causing the temperature at the tip to increase rapidly to800℃-1,300℃while rapidly decreasing with distance from the tip.Such wide temperature variations may have drawbacks.For example,the tendency for the temperature to decrease with distance from the fiber tip may unnecessarily complicate vascular ablation procedures. SUMMARY In one aspect,the present disclosure is directed to an instrument for laser surgery.In an embodiment,the disclosed instrument includes a cladding having a first refractive index and a fiber optic core coaxially disposed within the cladding and having a second refractive index that is higher than the first refractive index.The fiber optic core is configured to operatively engage with a source of laser energy at a proximal end of the fiber optic core.The instrument includes a fiber optic tip formed on a distal end of the fiber optic core and configured to extend outwardly from the cladding.The instrument further includes a plurality of refracting surfaces formed around the fiber optic tip.Each refracting surface is formed at least at one angle to a longitudinal axis of the fiber optic tip and configured to disperse the laser energy in a radial pattern. In some embodiments,the instrument further includes a plurality of annular prisms defined around the fiber optic tip.In some embodiments,each one of the plurality of refracting surfaces is disposed on a corresponding one of the plurality of annular prisms.In some embodiments,adiameter of each one of the plurality of annular prisms decreases as the distance of each one of the annular prisms from a distal end of the fiber optic tip decreases.

In some embodiments,the angle between the refracting surface and a longitudinal axis of the fiber optic core varies as a function of distance between each refracting surface and a distal end of the fiber optic tip.In some embodiments,the angle of a first refracting surface is greater than the angle of a second refracting surface that is farther than the first refracting surface from the distal end of the fiber optic tip.In some embodiments,the angle of each refracting surface decreases as the distance of each refracting surface from the distal end of the fiber optic tip decreases. In some embodiments,each one of the plurality of refracting surfaces includes a concave lens defined in the fiber optic tip.In some embodiments,adistal portion of the fiber optic tip on which the concave lenses are defined is tapered. In some embodiments,the laser surgery system includes a power supply operatively coupled to the controller and/or the source of laser energy. In yet another aspect,the present disclosure is directed to a method of treating tissue using a laser.In an embodiment,the method includes providing an instrument having a fiber optic core having,at a distal end of the fiber optic core,aplurality of refracting surfaces configured to disperse laser energy in a radial pattern.The method includes placing the distal end of the fiber optic core in proximity to targeted tissue,transmitting laser energy through the fiber optic core,and delivering the laser energy to the tissue in the radial pattern via the plurality of refracting surfaces.

The word“exemplary”is used herein to mean“serving as an example, instance,or illustration.”Any embodiment described herein as “exemplary”is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.The word“example”may be used interchangeably with the term“exemplary.” With reference to FIG.1,alaser surgery system10in accordance with the present disclosure includes a power supply12that is configured to deliver activation energy to laser14.Laser14may include any suitable structure capable of providing laser energy for surgical use, including without limitation,aCO 2laser,an excimer laser,a semiconductor laser(e.g.,alaser diode),or a fiber laser.Power supply 12is configured to convert line voltage into a form suitable for operation of laser14and may include a linear power supply circuit and/or switched- mode voltage converter circuit.Laser surgery system10includes controller13which communicates with user interface15and which conveys one or more control signals to power supply12and/or laser14to facilitate operation of laser surgery system10.For example,laser power level,pulse rate,pulse width,duty cycle,modulation,wavelength, operating voltage,etc.may be established either directly or indirectly via user interface15and communicated to power supply12and/or laser14. Controller13includes a storage unit17(e.g.,non-volatile memory)that is configured to store calibration data,user preference data,treatment parameters,and the like.In embodiments,controller13may be configured to perform diagnostic functions,built in test(BIT)functions, and power-up self tests(POST),to identify any need to perform service and maintenance,to replace consumables,and so forth,in order to ensure proper functioning of the laser surgery system10.Ashaft16having a radial terminus20disposed at a distal end of the shaft16includes a fiber optic assembly29in operable communication with an output18of the laser14and configured to deliver laser energy to tissue T. Afiber optic cable and terminus of an existing laser-based instrument is shown in FIGS.2A and2B.The core is the innermost portion of the fiber,which is surrounded by cladding,which,in turn,is encased in a protective jacket.The core transmits the light and has a higher refractive index than that of the cladding,which surrounds the core. By this arrangement,the light in the core intersects the boundary between the core and the cladding at an angle shallower than the critical angle based on the refractive indices of the core and the cladding,and therefore is reflected back into the core by total internal reflection.This repeats along the length of the fiber until the terminus is reached.At this point, because the light in the core intersects at an angle greater than the critical angle based on the refractive indices of the core and the air,the light is transmitted though the boundary of the terminus and the environment,and exits the fiber core.As illustrated in FIG.2B,when the laser light exits at the terminus,the temperature radiation pattern is characterized by a generally conical shape having an apex at the terminus and widening distally from the terminus.Since the laser light is concentrated at the terminus,e.g.,at the apex of the radiating pattern,the temperature at the terminus increases rapidly to800℃-1,300℃,which may be undesirable. Turning now to FIGS.3A,3B,and3C,aradial terminus20is disposed at a distal end of fiber optic assembly29.Fiber optic assembly 29includes a fiber core21which is transparent and has an index of refraction.The fiber core21has an elongate cylindrical shape and may be formed from glass(including,without limitation,silica,fluorozirconate, fluoroaluminate,chalcogenide,and sapphire glasses)or may be formed from transparent polymeric material,such as,without limitation, polymethyl methacrylate(a.k.a.acrylic polymer).The fiber core21is encased in cladding22which is formed from material having an index of refraction that is less than the index of refraction of the fiber core21. The cladding22,in mm,is encased in a jacket23that is configured to provide mechanical protection and support to the cladding22and the fiber core21.The jacket23may be formed from any suitable material,such as,without limitation,polyvinyl chloride(PVC),polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),and so forth.Generally,the jacket23is formed from material that is optically opaque to reduce interference with and/or leakage of light transmitted through the fiber core21.The fiber optic assembly20may include additional layers(not explicitly shown)which provide additional protection and/or modify a performance characteristic(e.g.,optical property)of the fiber optic assembly20. Aportion of the fiber core21extends distally beyond a distal end of the cladding22,the jacket22,and the shaft16to form a radial tip 27.The radial tip27includes a series of annular prisms30defined around the radial tip27,with each prism30having a refracting surface25. The refracting surface25is disposed at a prism angleθ R relative to a longitudinal axis A corresponding to the centerline of the fiber core21. This embodiment is best illustrated in FIGS.3A,3B,and3D.The prism angleθ R of each refracting surface25is related to the distance of the associated prism30from the distal end26of the radial tip27.As seen in FIG.3A,the prism angleθ R of each successively distal prism30is less than that of the prior(immediately proximal)prism30.By this arrangement,during use,the rays R of laser energy propagate distally through the fiber core21,and eventually intersect one of the refracting surfaces25at an angle greater than the critical angle(thereby not meeting the conditions for total internal reflection)and thus exit the fiber core21 in a radial pattern28(FIG.3C).An opaque or semitransparent coating 31may be disposed on a distal end26to reduce or eliminate laser emissions from distal end26. The prism angleθ R,prism height h,and prism length l may be arranged in accordance with the nature of the laser source and the numerical aperture of the fiber core21.Thus,by tailoring the angle and the dimensions of the prisms30,the distribution of rays exiting from the fiber core21can be tailored as required.In embodiments where the laser source intensity distribution and the numerical aperture are fixed,the prisms30are designed to obtain the uniform distributed radially emitted laser profile as shown in Fig3C,which,in turn,provides a constant temperature along the length of the radial tip27. Dimensions of the prism(i.e.,the angleθ R,height h,and length l)may be dependent upon the wave length of the laser but are not dependent upon a type of the laser.That is,the lengthier the wave length of the laser is,the bigger the dimensions of the prism become and vice versa.In embodiments,the prism angleθ R may range from0degree to 90degree,and the prism height and length may range from0.1mm to1.0 mm.The numeral aperture may range from0.1to0.5. Referring now to FIGS.4A,4B,and4C,an embodiment of a tapered terminus40in accordance with the present disclosure is shown. Tapered terminus40includes a fiber optic assembly49that includes a core41coaxially disposed within a cladding42,which,in mm,is coaxially disposed within a jacket43.Fiber optic assembly49is longitudinally disposed within a shaft44of a laser surgery instrument(not explicitly shown)to facilitate the treatment of tissue therewith. Aportion of the fiber core41extends distally beyond the other elements of fiber optic assembly49and shaft44(e.g.,extends distally beyond the distal end of the cladding42,the jacket49,and the shaft44)to form a tapered tip47which includes a series of annular prisms 50defined around the tapered tip47,with each prism50having a refracting surface45.In this embodiment and as best illustrated in FIGS. 4A and4B,as the distance of each prism50from a distal end46of the radial tip47decreases,the prism angle of the corresponding refracting surface45of each prism also decreases.In addition,as the distance of each prism50from the distal end46decreases,the diameter of each prism also decreases,thus creating the tapered profile of the tapered tip47.By this arrangement,during use,the rays R of laser energy which propagate distally through the fiber core45intersect the various one or more refracting surfaces45at an angle greater than the critical angle(not meeting the conditions for total internal reflection),which is based on the refractive indices of the fiber core41and the air,and thus exit the fiber core41in a tapered pattern48(FIG.4C). Referring now to FIGS.5A,5B,and5C,still another embodiment of a fiber optic tip60is illustrated having a plurality of concave lenses62each having a refracting surface66.The plurality of concave lenses62are defined in an outer surface64of a fiber core61. As shown in FIGS.5A and5B,the plurality of concave lenses62are arranged in a regular pattern.However,the plurality of concave lenses 62may be arranged in a random,pseudorandom,or arbitrary pattern.In addition,each of the plurality of concave lenses62may vary in size and shape from one another.For example,and without limitation,each of the plurality of concave lenses62may differ in diameter,depth,degree of concavity,and shape(e.g.,ellipsoidal).As the laser rays R intersect the refracting surface66of each of the plurality of concave lenses62at an angle greater than the critical angle,no total internal reflection occurs,and consequently,the laser rays R exit the fiber core61in a generally radial pattern68. One or more concave lenses62may be defined in a distal end 63of the fiber core61.Additionally or alternatively,an opaque or semitransparent coating65may be disposed on the distal end63to reduce or eliminate laser emissions from the distal end63.The use of one or more concave lenses62and/or an opaque or semitransparent coating65 may help control the laser radiation pattern that emits from distal end63 during the use. FIG.5D illustrates a radiation pattern generated during the use of the fiber optic tip60of FIG.5A where one or more concave lenses62 are defined in the distal end63of the fiber core61.As can be seen,this arrangement exhibits a generally radial pattern68with a hemispherical distal region69having an overall evenly-distributed temperature pattern. Yet another embodiment of a fiber optic tip70is illustrated in FIGS.6A and6B wherein a plurality of concave lenses72,each having a refracting surface76,are defined in an outer surface74of a conically- tapered tip75of a fiber core71.As shown,the plurality of concave lenses72are arranged in a random pattern.However,the plurality of concave lenses72may be arranged in a regular,pseudorandom,or arbitrary pattern.In addition,each of the plurality of concave lenses72 may vary in size and shape from each another,e.g.,adiameter,depth, degree of concavity,and shape(e.g.,ellipsoidal)from one another. During a use of the fiber optic tip70,the conically-tapered tip75and/or the arrangement of the plurality of concave lenses72function to generate a generally conical radiation pattern having an even temperature distribution.
