TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to the fields of pharmaceutical and organic chemistry, and provides arylsulfonyl pyrazoline carboxamidine derivatives, intermediates, formulations and methods. BACKGROUND ART Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT), a key transmitter of the peripheral and central nervous system, modulates a wide range of physiological and pathological functions, mediated through a number of receptor families termed 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7. Although the functions of the latter three are less well understood than those of the others, it is generally accepted that compounds which selectively interfere with 5-HT-mediated signal transduction are important novel drug targets. The rat 5-HT6 receptor was cloned by two different groups (Ruat, 1993; Sebben, 1994), and that of the human, sharing a 89% sequence identity, shortly thereafter (Kohen, 1996). Much of the recent interest in the 5-HT6 receptor is because several psychotropic agents are high affinity antagonists at the human 5-HT6 receptor (Kohen, 1996; Roth, 1994). These compounds include amitriptyline (Ki=65 nM) and the atypical antipsychotics clozapine (Ki=9.5 nM), olanzapine (Ki=10 nM), and quetiapine (Ki=33 nM). None of these compounds, however, is selective. The first selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists reported are Ro 04-6790 and Ro 63-0563. Their usefulness is limited by their moderate affinity (Ki=50 nM and 12 nM, respectively) and poor pharmacokinetics (Sleight, 1998). With the recent development of the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists Ro-04-6790 and SB-271046, there have been several reports on the activity of these compounds in models of cognitive function. SB-271046 improved performance in the Morris water maze (Rogers, 1999). These results are consistent with the finding that chronic intracerebroventricular administration of antisense oligonucleotides directed toward the 5-HT6 receptor sequence led to improvements in some measures of performance in the Morris water maze (Bentley, 1999b). Recently, the effect of 5-HT6 antagonists and 5-HT6 antisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported (Bentley, 1997; Bentley, 1999a; Woolley, 2001). Obesity is a condition characterized by an increase in body fat content resulting in excess body weight above accepted norms. Obesity is the most important nutritional disorder in the western world and represents a major health problem in all industrialized countries. This disorder leads to increased mortality due to increased incidences of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, digestive disease, respiratory disease, cancer and type-2 diabetes. 5-HT6 selective ligands have been identified as potentially useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of certain disorders of the central nervous system such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and/or schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, mood disorders, migraine, Alzheimer's disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), age related cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative diseases characterized by impaired neuronal growth, sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, binge eating disorders, panic attacks, akathisia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, and pain, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. 5-HT6 selective ligands are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal disorders such as functional bowel disorder and Irritable Bowel Syndrome and in the treatment or prophylaxis of obesity and type-2 diabetes, to achieve reduction of body weight and of body weight gain. The reduction of body weight and of body weight gain (e.g. treating body-weight disorders) is achieved inter alia by reduction of food intake. The goal of the present invention was to provide potent and selective 5-HT6 antagonists, metabolically more stable than known, chemically related, 5-HT6 antagonists (as disclosed in WO 2008/034863), compounds useful for the treatment of certain CNS disorders. DISCLOSURE Surprisingly it was found that certain arylsulfonyl pyrazoline carboxamidine derivatives bearing a H-bond donor functionality on or in the arylsulfonyl moiety, are 5-HT6 receptor antagonists, more potent, and metabolically more stable than known, chemically related, 5-HT6 antagonists.

The invention further relates to combination therapies wherein a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition or formulation comprising a compound of the invention, is administered concurrently or sequentially or as a combined preparation with another therapeutic agent or agents, for treating one or more of the conditions listed. Such other therapeutic agent(s) may be administered prior to, simultaneously with, or following the administration of the compounds of the invention. The invention also provides compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, kits and methods for treating a disorder or condition chosen from the disorders listed herein, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of such treating a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The compounds of the invention possess 5-HT6 receptor antagonizing activity. This activity of the compounds of the invention is readily demonstrated, for example, using one or more of the assays described herein or known in the art. The invention also provides methods of preparing the compounds of the invention and the intermediates used in those methods. Isolation and purification of the compounds and intermediates described herein can be affected, if desired, by any suitable separation or purification procedure such as, for example, filtration, extraction, crystallization, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, thick-layer chromatography, preparative low or high-pressure liquid chromatography, or a combination of these procedures. Specific illustrations of suitable separation and isolation procedures can be taken from the preparations and examples. However, other equivalent separation or isolation procedures could, of course, also be used. The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Depending on the nature of the various substituents, the molecule can have additional asymmetric centers. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers. All of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers, in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds, belong to this invention. The present invention comprehends all such isomeric forms of these compounds. Formula (1) shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry. The independent syntheses of these diastereomers, or their chromatographic separations, may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed therein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates, which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration. Racemic mixtures of the compounds can be separated into the individual enantiomers by methods well-known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling often consists of the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base, for example (−)-di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases: Methods well-known in the art. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well-known in the art. Cis and trans isomers of the compound of formula (1), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, also belong to the invention, and this also applies to tautomers of the compounds of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as polymorphs: as such intended to belong to the invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e. hydrates), or common organic solvents. Such solvates also fall within the scope of this invention. Isotopically-labeled compound of formula (1) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, including compounds of formula (1) isotopically-labeled to be detectable by PET or SPECT, also fall within the scope of the invention. The same applies to compounds of formula (I) labeled with [13C]-, [14C]-, [3H]-, [18F]-, [125I]- or other isotopically enriched atoms, suitable for receptor binding or metabolism studies. The compounds of the invention may also be used as reagents or standards in the biochemical study of neurological function, dysfunction and disease. Definitions Within the context of this description, the term ‘5-HT6 receptor antagonist’ refers to a compound displaying this activity—measured by unambiguous and well accepted pharmacological assays, including those described in WO 2008/034863—without displaying substantial cross-reactivity towards another receptor. General terms used in the description of compounds herein disclosed bear their usual meanings. The term alkyl as used herein denotes a univalent saturated branched or straight hydrocarbon chain. Unless otherwise stated, such chains can contain from 1 to 18 carbon atoms. Representative of such alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, tert-pentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, and the like. When qualified as ‘lower’, the alkyl group will contain from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The same carbon content applies to the parent term ‘alkane’, and to derivative terms such as ‘alkoxy’. The carbon content of various hydrocarbon containing moieties is indicated by a prefix designating the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms in the moiety, i.e., the prefix Cx-y defines the number of carbon atoms present from the integer “x” to the integer “y” inclusive. ‘Alkyl(C1-3)’ for example, means methyl, ethyl, n-propyl or isopropyl, and ‘alkyl(C1-4)’ means ‘methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, 2-butyl, isobutyl or 2-methyl-n-propyl’. The term ‘alkenyl’ denotes straight or branched hydrocarbon radicals having one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, such as vinyl, allyl, butenyl, etc., and for example represents (C2-4)-alkenyl. In ‘alkynyl’ groups the straight or branched hydrocarbon radicals have one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds, such as ethynyl, propargyl, 1-butynyl, 2-butynyl, etc., and for example represent (C2-4)alkynyl. Unless otherwise stated, álkenyl’ and ‘alkynyl chains can contain from 1 to 18 carbon atoms. The term ‘acyl’ means alkyl(C1-3) carbonyl, arylcarbonyl or aryl-alkyl(C1-3)-carbonyl. ‘Aryl’ embraces mono- or polycyclic aromatic groups, including phenyl, naphthyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphtyl, indenyl, fluorenyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, naphthacenyl and azulenyl. ‘Heteroaryl’ embraces mono- or polycyclic hetero-aromatic, including furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, imidazolyl, imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazolyl, pyrazolyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, 1,3,5-triazinyl, indazolyl, indolyl, indolizinyl, isoindolyl, benzo[b]furanyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroiso-quinolinyl, indanyl, indenyl, benzo[b]thienyl, 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-5-yl, benzimidazolyl, cinnolinyl, carbazolyl, acridinyl, phenazinyl, phenothiazinyl, phenoxazinyl, benzothiazolyl, benzo[1,2,5]thia-diazolyl, purinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, quinolizinyl, phtalazinyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, 1,8-naphthyridinyl and pteridinyl. ‘Halo’ or ‘Halogen’ means chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo; ‘hetero’ as in ‘heteroalkyl, heteroaromatic’ etc. means containing one or more N, O or S atoms. ‘heteroalkyl’ includes alkyl groups with heteroatoms in any position, thus including N-bound O-bound or S-bound alkyl groups. The term “substituted” means that the specified group or moiety bears one or more substituents. Where any group may carry multiple substituents, and a variety of possible substituents can be provided, the substituents are independently selected, and need not to be the same. The term “unsubstituted” means that the specified group bears no substituents. With reference to substituents, the term ‘independently’ means that when more than one of such substituents are possible, they may be the same or different from each other. ‘Cycloalkyl(C3-8)’ means cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopheptyl or cyclooctyl; ‘heterocycloalkyl(C4-8)’ refers to heteroatom containing rings including piperidinyl, morpholinyl, azepanyl, pyrrolidinyl, thiomorpholinyl, piperazinyl, tetrahydrofuryl, tetrahydro-pyranyl. The terms “oxy”, “thio” and “carbo” as used herein as part of another group respectively refer to an oxygen atom, a sulphur atom and a carbonyl (C═O) group, serving as linker between two groups, such as for instance hydroxyl, oxyalkyl, thioalkyl, carboxyalkyl, etc. The term “amino” as used herein alone, or as part of another group, refers to a nitrogen atom that may be either terminal, or a linker between two other groups, wherein the group may be a primary, secondary or tertiary (two hydrogen atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom, one hydrogen atom bonded to the nitrogen atom and no hydrogen atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom, respectively) amine. The terms “sulfinyl” and “sulfonyl” as used herein as part of another group respectively refer to an —SO— or an —SO2— group. To provide a more concise description, the terms ‘compound’ or ‘compounds’ include tautomers, stereoisomers, N-oxides, isotopically-labelled analogues, or pharmacologically acceptable salts, also when not explicitly mentioned. N-oxides of the compounds mentioned above belong to the invention. Tertiary amines may or may not give rise to N-oxide metabolites. The extent to what N-oxidation takes place varies from trace amounts to a near quantitative conversion. N-oxides may be more active than their corresponding tertiary amines, or less active. Whilst N-oxides can easily be reduced to their corresponding tertiary amines by chemical means, in the human body this happens to varying degrees. Some N-oxides undergo nearly quantitative reductive conversion to the corresponding tertiary amines, in other cases conversion is a mere trace reaction, or even completely absent (Bickel, 1969). The term ‘form’ encompasses all solids: polymorphs, solvates, and amorphous forms. ‘Crystal form’ refers to various solid forms of the same compound, for example polymorphs, solvates and amorphous forms. ‘Amorphous forms’ are non-crystalline materials with no long range order, and generally do not give a distinctive powder X-ray diffraction pattern. Crystal forms in general have been described by Byrn (1995) and Martin (1995). ‘Polymorphs’ are crystal structures in which a compound can crystallize in different crystal packing arrangements, all of which have the same elemental composition. Polymorphism is a frequently occurring phenomenon, affected by several crystallization conditions such as temperature, level of supersaturation, presence of impurities, polarity of solvent, rate of cooling. Different polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, solid state NMR spectra, infrared or Raman spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. To give a more concise description, some of the quantitative expressions given herein are not qualified with either “about” or “approximately”. It is understood that whether either of these terms is used explicitly or not, every quantity given is meant to refer to the actual value, and also to the approximation to such given value that would reasonably be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including approximations due to experimental or measurement conditions for such given value. The terms “selective” and “selectivity” refer to compounds that display reactivity towards a particular receptor (e.g. a 5-HT6 receptor) without displaying substantial cross-reactivity towards another receptor (e.g. other 5-HT receptor sub-types). Throughout the description and the claims of this specification the word “comprise” and variations of the word, such as “comprising” and “comprises” is not intended to exclude other additives, components, integers or steps. While it may be possible for the compounds of formula (1) to be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present them as a ‘pharmaceutical composition’. According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (1), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof, and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be ‘acceptable’ in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The term “composition” as used herein encompasses a product comprising specified ingredients in predetermined amounts or proportions, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from combining specified ingredients in specified amounts. In relation to pharmaceutical compositions, this term encompasses a product comprising one or more active ingredients, and an optional carrier comprising inert ingredients, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. In general, pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. The pharmaceutical composition includes enough of the active object compound to produce the desired effect upon the progress or condition of diseases. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Within the context of this application, the term ‘combination preparation’ comprises both true combinations, meaning a compound of formula (1) and one or more other medicaments physically combined in one preparation such as a tablet or injection fluid, as well as ‘kit-of-parts’, comprising a compound of formula (1) and one or more other medicaments in separate dosage forms, together with instructions for use, optionally with further means for facilitating compliance with the administration of the component compounds, e.g. label or drawings. With true combinations, the pharmacotherapy by definition is simultaneous. The contents of ‘kit-of-parts’, can be administered either simultaneously or at different time intervals. Therapy being either concomitant or sequential will be dependant on the characteristics of the other medicaments used, characteristics like onset and duration of action, plasma levels, clearance, etc., as well as on the disease, its stage, and characteristics of the individual patient. The affinity of the compounds of the invention for 5-HT6 receptors was determined as described above. From the binding affinity measured for a given compound of formula (1), one can estimate a theoretical lowest effective dose. At a concentration of the compound equal to twice the measured Ki-value, nearly 100% of the 5-HT6 receptors likely will be occupied by the compound. Converting that concentration to mg compound per kg patient yields a theoretical lowest effective dose, assuming ideal bioavailability. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and other considerations may alter the dose actually administered to a higher or lower value. The typical daily dose of the active ingredients varies within a wide range and will depend on various factors such as the relevant indication, the route of administration, the age, weight and sex of the patient, and may be determined by a physician. In general, total daily dose administration to a patient in single or individual doses, may be in amounts, for example, from 0.001 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily, and more usually from 0.01 to 1,000 mg per day, of total active ingredients. Such dosages will be administered to a patient in need of treatment from one to three times each day, or as often as needed for efficacy, and for periods of at least two months, more typically for at least six months, or chronically. The term “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of a therapeutic agent to treat a condition treatable by administrating a composition of the invention. That amount includes the amount sufficient to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or ameliorative response in a human tissue system. The effect may include treating conditions listed herein. The precise pharmaceutically effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject's size and health, the nature and extent of the condition being treated, recommendations of the physician, and the therapeutics, or combination of therapeutics, selected for administration. Thus, it is not useful to specify an exact pharmaceutically effective amount in advance. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well-known in the art. They can be prepared in situ when finally isolating and purifying the compounds of the invention, or separately by reacting them with pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids, including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids (Berge, 1977). The ‘free base’ form may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid, and isolating the parent compound in the conventional matter. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention. The term “treatment” refers to any treatment of a human condition or disease, and includes: (1) inhibiting the disease or condition, i.e., arresting its development, (2) relieving the disease or condition, i.e., causing the condition to regress, or (3) stopping the symptoms of the disease. The term ‘inhibit’ includes its generally accepted meaning which includes restraining, alleviating, ameliorating, and slowing, stopping or reversing progression, severity, or a resultant symptom. As used herein, the term “medical therapy” intendeds to include diagnostic and therapeutic regimens carried out in vivo or ex vivo on humans. As used herein, the term “body weight disorders” refers to the disorders caused by an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, resulting in abnormal (e.g., excessive) body weight. Such body weight-disorders include obesity (Roth, 1994; Sibley, 1993; Sleigh, 1995, 1997). ‘Obesity’ refers to a condition whereby a person has a Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated as weight per height squared (km/m2), of at least 25.9.

EXAMPLE 2 General Aspects of Syntheses Suitable syntheses of claimed compounds and intermediates containing pyrazoline moieties follow routes analogous to those previously disclosed in WO 2008/034863, employing 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole or 4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrazole building blocks which are either commercially available or prepared as described below. Route 1 employs N-(bis-alkylsulfanyl-methylene)-sulfonamide structures of general formula (V), which may be prepared from sulfonamides by reaction with CS2 in the presence of KOH, followed by reaction with an alkyl halide such as methyl iodide. The two S-alkyl functionalities can subsequently be substituted by amines, preferably starting with the pyrazoline building blocks to obtain structures of general formula (VI), to end with sulfonylpyrazoline carboxamidine derivatives of general formula (IV). Route 2 employs alkyl-isothiourea fragments or suitable salt forms thereof of general formula (IX), conveniently prepared by reaction of thiourea building blocks with alkyl halides, such as methyl iodide, that can be reacted with pyrazolines in the presence of base to obtain pyrazoline carboxamidine derivatives of general formula (X). The latter can be reacted with sulfonyl halides (X═Br, Cl, F, preferably Cl) in the presence of base to obtain sulfonylpyrazoline carboxamidine derivatives of general formula (IV). Route 3 employs sulfonyl carbamates of general formula (I), which can for instance be prepared by reaction of sulfonamides with methyl chloroformate or di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of base. Their reaction products with pyrazolines of general formula (II) can subsequently be converted into the chloroimine intermediates of general formula (III) using halogenating agents such as PCl3, POCl3/DMAP or 2-chloro-1,3-dimethylimidazolinium chloride (DMC), followed by reaction with amines to obtain sulfonylpyrazoline carboxamidine derivatives of general formula (IV). The selection of the particular synthetic procedures depends on factors known to those skilled in the art such as the compatibility of functional groups with the reagents used, the possibility to use protecting groups, catalysts, activating and coupling reagents and the ultimate structural features present in the final compound being prepared. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by mixing a compound of the present invention with a suitable acid, for instance an inorganic acid or an organic acid.

EXAMPLE 5 Pharmacological Methods In Vitro Affinity for Human 5-HT6 Receptors Affinity for human 5-HT6 receptors was measured in a membrane preparation of CHO-cells transfected with human 5-HT6 receptors by binding studies using [3H]-N-Methyl-Lysergic acid diethylamide ([3H]-LSD) as ligand. The membrane preparation was prepared from cells supplied by Euroscreen (Brussels). CHO/Gα16/mtAEQ/h5HT6-A1 cells were grown in T-flasks in CHO-S-SFM II medium (Gibco BRL), supplemented with 1% dialysed FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, Geneticin 500 μg/ml and Zeocin 200 μg/ml. Cells were harvested using 0.25% Trypsin (1 ml/T175-flask), centrifuged and subsequently suspended in CHO-S-SFM II medium and frozen at −80° C. After thawing cells were centrifuged during 3 minutes at 1500 g at 4° C. From the pellet, cell membranes were prepared by two cycles of homogenization (Potter-Elvehjem 10 strokes, 600 rpm) and centrifugation (40,000 g for 15 min, 4° C.). The assay was established so as to achieve steady state conditions and to optimize specific binding. For the 5-HT6 receptor, membranes from 5·105 cells were incubated with 5.0 nM [3H]-LSD at 37° C. for 30 minutes. Nonspecific binding was determined using 10−5 M serotonin. Assays were terminated by vacuum filtration through glass fibre filters (GF/B) which had been pretreated with 0.5% polyethyleneimine. Total and bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Greater than 80% specific binding was achieved in each of these assays. Compounds were tested at a 4 log concentration range; all determinations were performed as triplicates. IC50 values were determined by non-linear regression analysis using Hill equation curve fitting. The inhibition constants (Ki-values) were calculated from the Cheng-Preushoff equation: [in-line-formulae]Ki=IC50:(1+L/Kd)[/in-line-formulae] wherein L represents the concentration [3H]-LSD in the assay, and Kd its affinity for the receptor. Results are expressed as pKi-values, means±SD of at least three separate experiments. In Vitro Functional Activity ((Ant)Agonism) on Human 5-HT6 Receptors The CHO-human-5HT6-Aeqorin assay was bought from Euroscreen, Brussels (Euroscreen, Technical dossier, Human recombinant serotonin 5-HT6-A1 receptor, DNA clone and CHO AequoScreen™ recombinant cell line, catalog no: ES-316-A, February 2003). Human-5-HT6-Aequorin cells express mitochondrial targeted apo-Aequorin. Cells have to be loaded with coelanterazine, in order to reconstitute active Aequorin. After binding of agonists to the human 5-HT6 receptor the intracellular calcium concentration increases and binding of calcium to the apo-Aequorin/coelenterazine complex leads to an oxidation reaction of coelenterazine, which results in the production of apo-Aequorin, coelenteramide, CO2 and light (λmax 469 nm). This luminescent response is dependent on the agonist concentration. Luminescence is measured using the MicroBeta Jet (Perkin Elmer). Agonistic effects of compounds are expressed as pEC50. Antagonistic effects of compounds were determined as inhibition of 10−8 M α-methylserotonin induced luminescence and the pA2 was calculated according to Cheng-Preushoff equation. Compounds were tested at a 5 log concentration range, and 3 independent experiments were performed in duplicate. In Vitro Determination of Metabolic Stability in the Presence of Human/Rat Hepatocytes To obtain an in vitro estimate of biological half-life (t1/2), compounds were incubated at 37° C., in 96-well plates, in WME-medium containing 5 μg/ml insulin, during 0, 10, 20, 40 or 60 minutes, with human or rat hepatocytes (50,000 per well), in waterbath, under an atmosphere of oxygen, containing 4-7% CO2. Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO (1 mg/ml). Testconcentrations were 1 μg/ml. To avoid toxic effects on hepatocytes, test concentrations DMSO never exceeded 0.1% of the testvolume. After the incubation period, 96-well plates were put on ice, to each well 100 μl ice cold CAN was added, after which plates were vortexed and centrifuged at 2,500 rpm, at 4° C., for 5 minutes. Next, the supernatant from each well was pipetted off, and into a collection plate, put on ice, covered with a rubber cover, and stored at −80° C. until analysis by HPLC-MS. HPLC-MS Analysis: Possible reduction of the concentration of test compounds was measured using an Agilent series 1100 LC-MSD. Dependant of the structure of the test compound either MH+ or (M−H)− was measured. Prior to analysis samples were allowed to warm (from −80° C.) to room temperature, after which they were homogenized by vortexing for a few seconds. Next, samples were centrifuged at 3,500 rpm, at 4° C., for 10 minutes. Samples were injected into a single quadrupole HPLC-MS system, using a gradient in order to achieve chromatographic separation. In the mass spectrometer, ionization was achieved by ESI, followed by analysis of the formed ions by SIM. For each compound a full scan (100-1000 m/z) was measured. The ‘area's under the curve’ at the different incubation times were integrated, and plotted against (incubation) time, yielding t1/2. Experimental details were as follows: Eluent A: 0.77 g ammoniumacetate+800 ml water+100 ml methanol+100 acetonitrilEluent B: 0.77 g ammoniumacetate+100 ml water+100 ml methanol+800 acetonitril Pump Gradient Table: Time (min) Eluent A (%) Eluent B (%) Flow (ml/min) 0.00 100 0 1 3.60 0 100 1 7.20 0 100 1 8.50 100 0 1 11.00 100 0 1 column: Pre-column Chromsep Guard Column SS 10 × 2 mm (CP28141) Inertsil 5 ODS-3 100 × 3.0 mm (CP22234) Column temperature 25° C.
