Step 2: 3-Chloro-N-(3-diethylaminophenyl)-propionamide
N,N-Diethyl-m-phenylene diamine (8.2 g, 0.05 mol) and sodium hydrogen carbonate (10 g, 0.119 mol) are stirred at room temperature in methylene chloride (80 ml) while β-chloropropionyl chloride (7.61 g, 0.06 mol) is added dropwise over 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature. Water (5 ml) is added and stirred a further 2 hours at ambient temperature. The methylene chloride fraction is dried (MgSO4), poured through silica gel and evaporated to dryness yielding 3-chloro-N-(3-diethylaminophenyl)-propionamide as a grey-brown solid (12.2 g, 95%). The material is recrystallised from methanol, isolating the material at 0° C. as almost colourless needles, mp=88-90° C.
