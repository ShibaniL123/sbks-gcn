No. 10/593,383, titled “Method and Substances for Isolating miRNAs, filed on Sep. 19, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,278,035, which is a 371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2006/032264, titled “Method and Substances for Isolating miRNAs,” filed Aug. 18, 2006, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/709,861, titled “Method and Substances for the Isolation, Amplification and Detection of miRNAs,” filed on Aug. 19, 2005, the contents of which are incorporated in this disclosure by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, generally between 18 and 24 residues, polyribonucleotides derived from longer hairpin noncoding transcripts in eukaryotes miRNAs play a significant role in cellular developmental and differentiation pathways. Consequently, there have been considerable efforts made to understand and characterize the temporal, spatial and cellular expression levels and patterns of expression of miRNAs to ascertain their precise role in cellular development and differentiation in both normal and disease states. miRNAs are currently studied by, first, obtaining the total RNA from a sample. Next, the total RNA is fractionated into subpopulations by gel electrophoresis or by chromatographic fractionation and size selective elution. Then, the appropriate section of the gel is cut, and the 18-24 RNAs are eluted from the gel, or the eluted fraction containing single stranded RNAs in the size range of 18-24 ribonucleotides is collected. Next, the RNAs are isolated by precipitation and the miRNAs are characterized. Disadvantageously, however, these methods do not work well when the amount of sample is small, such as samples from tumor tissue or biopsy material. Further, characterization of the miRNAs isolated by present methods usually comprises a several step amplification procedure followed by detection, quantitation, cloning and sequencing. Because of the large number of steps in these processes and the notorious inefficiencies associated with the repeated purification, the isolation and identification of miRNAs using present methods is time consuming, relatively expensive, requires relatively large amounts of material and is not fully representative of the population of miRNAs expressed within a small sample, such as within a biopsy of a tumor. Additionally, the present methods are not specific to isolating and identifying an miRNA, and therefore, often isolate and identify siRNA, tRNA, 5S/5.8SrRNA and degraded RNA from additional cellular RNAs. Therefore, there is the need for an improved method for isolation and identification of miRNAs that is not associated with these disadvantages.

According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a set of capture probes comprising a first capture probe and a second capture probe, where the first capture probe has a first adapter segment sequence that is different from the first adapter segment sequence of the second capture probe, where the first capture probe has an miRNA binding segment sequence that is different from the miRNA binding segment sequence of the second capture probe, and where the first capture probe has a second adapter segment sequence that is different from the second adapter segment sequence of the second capture probe. Referring again to FIG. 1, the first adapter segment 12 comprises a 3′ end 18 and a 5′ end 20. As can be seen in FIG. 1, the 5′ end 20 of the first adapter segment 12 is connected to the 3′ end 22 of the miRNA binding segment 16, that is the first adapter segment 12 is connected upstream of the miRNA binding segment 16. In one embodiment, the first adapter segment 12 is substantially complementary to and capable of hybridizing a first linker probe designated in this disclosure as a “first linker.” When used in the method of the present invention, the first adapter segment 12 facilitates the ligation of the 3′ end of the first linker to the 5′ end of the miRNA of interest by aligning the first linker in position for ligation to the miRNA of interest. In one embodiment, the first adapter segment has a number of residues between 5 and 50. In another embodiment, the first adapter segment has a number of residues between 5 and 20. In another embodiment, the first adapter segment has a number of residues between 6 and 16. In one embodiment, the first adapter segment 12 comprises one or more than one sequence 24 or sequence 26 that is a restriction site motif. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the specific restriction site motif, when present, is not present in the DNA analog of the miRNA of interest that is being isolated and identified by the present method. In one embodiment, the restriction site motif is acted upon by a restriction enzyme selected from the group consisting of BamH I, Hind III and EcoR I. In a preferred embodiment, the restriction site motif is acted upon by a restriction enzyme selected from the group consisting of Not I, Xho I, Xma I and Nhe I, because BamH I, Hind III and EcoR I also act upon some sequences of miRNA. As will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, however, other suitable restriction site motifs can also be used. In another embodiment, the first adapter segment 12 comprises a sequence 24 or a sequence 26 that is a polynucleotide synthesis promoter motif for a polynucleotide polymerase, or that is complementary to a polynucleotide synthesis promoter motif for a polynucleotide polymerase. In a preferred embodiment, the polynucleotide synthesis promoter motif is a motif for a polynucleotide synthesis promoter selected from the group consisting of T7, SP6, a T3 DNA dependent RNA polymerase, a type 2 RNA polymerase of E. coli and single stranded DNA dependent N4 RNA polymerase. The polynucleotide synthesis promoter motif can be a motif for any other suitable polynucleotide synthesis promoter, however, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure. As will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, the sequence that is a restriction site motif of the first adapter segment 12 can be in either position 24 or in the position 26 as indicated in FIG. 1, and the sequence that is a polynucleotide synthesis promoter motif can be in either position 24 or in the position 26 as indicated in FIG. 1. In a preferred embodiment, there is no other a restriction site motif sequence of the first adapter segment 12 other than in the position 24 or in the position 26 as shown in FIG. 1. In another embodiment, the first adapter segment 12 comprises a solid phase binding group 28 to immobilize the capture probe 10 to a solid phase. In one embodiment, the solid phase binding group 28 is at or near the 3′ end 18 of the first adapter segment 12, however, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, the solid phase binding group 28 can be anywhere on the capture probe 10 other than at or near the 3′ end 18 of the first adapter segment 12. In one embodiment, the solid phase binding group 28 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase covalently. In another embodiment, the solid phase binding group 28 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase non-covalently. In one embodiment, the solid phase binding group 28 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase reversibly. As used in this context, “reversibly” means that the solid phase binding group 28 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase in such a way that the solid phase binding group 28 can be disassociated from the solid phase without destruction of the capture probe 10 and without disruption of hybridization between the capture probe 10 and the ligated first linker 48-miRNA of interest 42-second linker 50 (as disclosed below). In another embodiment, the solid phase binding group 28 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase non-reversibly. For example, in one embodiment, the solid phase binding group 28 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase non-covalently and reversibly, where the solid phase binding group 28 comprises biotin or an analog of biotin capable of binding with avidin or streptavidin or functional analogs of avidin or streptavidin with high affinity, such as with an affinity having an affinity constant of between about 10e12 and 10e20. Additionally for example, in one embodiment the solid phase binding group 28 of the first adapter segment 12 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase covalently and non-reversibly, where the solid phase binding group 28 comprises a terminal 5′ primary amino group at the 3′ end 18 of the first adapter segment 12 for coupling to a solid phase surface having free carboxyl groups using standard carbodiimide chemistry, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure. Further, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, any solid phase binding group 28 present in the first adapter segment 12, and any technique for coupling the solid phase binding group 28 to a solid phase used in connection with the present method should not interfere with the hybridization and capture of the miRNA of interest to the miRNA binding segment 16, or with any other step of the present method. By way of example only, in one embodiment the first adapter segment 12 comprises DNA and has a first adapter segment sequence in the 5′ to 3′ direction of ATTTAGGTGACACTATAG, SEQ ID NO:1. The second adapter segment 14 comprises a 3′ end 30 and a 5′ end 32. As can be seen in FIG. 1, the 3′ end 30 of the second adapter segment 14 is connected to the 5′ end 34 of the miRNA binding segment 16, that is the second adapter segment 14 is connected downstream of the miRNA binding segment 16. In one embodiment, the second adapter segment 14 is substantially complementary to and capable of hybridizing a second linker probe designated in this disclosure as a “second linker.” When used in the method of the present invention, the second adapter segment 14 facilitates the ligation of the 5′ end of the second linker to the 3′ end of the miRNA of interest by aligning the second linker in position for ligation to the miRNA of interest. In one embodiment, the second adapter segment 14 has a number of residues between 5 and 50. In another embodiment, the second adapter segment 14 has a number of residues between 5 and 20. In another embodiment, the second adapter segment 14 has a number of residues between 6 and 16. In another embodiment, the second adapter segment 14 comprises one or more than one sequence 36 that is a restriction site motif. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the specific restriction site motif, when present, is not present in the DNA analog of the miRNA of interest that is being isolated and identified by the present methods. In one embodiment, the restriction site motif is acted upon by a restriction enzyme selected from the group consisting of BamH I, Hind III and EcoR I. In a preferred embodiment, the restriction site motif is acted upon by a restriction enzyme selected from the group consisting of Not I, Xho I, Xma I and Nhe I, because BamH I, Hind III and EcoR I also act upon some sequences of miRNA. As will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, however, other suitable restriction site motifs can also be used. In one embodiment, the one or more than one sequence 24 that is a restriction site motif is identical to the one or more than one sequence 36 that is a restriction site motif. In another embodiment, the one or more than one sequence 24 that is a restriction site motif is different from the one or more than one sequence 36 that is a restriction site motif. In one embodiment, the second adapter segment 14 comprises a sequence 38 that is a polynucleotide synthesis promoter motif for a polynucleotide polymerase, or that is complementary to a polynucleotide synthesis promoter motif for a polynucleotide polymerase. In a preferred embodiment, the polynucleotide synthesis promoter motif is a motif for a polynucleotide synthesis promoter selected from the group consisting of T7, SP6, a T3 DNA dependent RNA polymerase, a type 2 RNA polymerase of E. coli and single stranded DNA dependent N4 RNA polymerase. The polynucleotide synthesis promoter motif can be a motif for any other suitable polynucleotide synthesis promoter, however, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure. As will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, the sequence that is a restriction site motif of the second adapter segment 14 can be in either position 36 or in the position 38 as indicated in FIG. 1, and the sequence that is a polynucleotide synthesis promoter motif can be in either position 36 or in the position 38 as indicated in FIG. 1. In a preferred embodiment, there is no other a restriction site motif sequence of the second adapter segment 14 other than in the position 36 or in the position 38 as shown in FIG. 1. By way of example only, in one embodiment the second adapter segment 14 comprises DNA and has a second adapter segment sequence in the 5′ to 3′ direction of CCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA SEQ ID NO:2. In another embodiment, the second adapter segment 14 comprises a solid phase binding group 40 to immobilize the capture probe 10 to a solid phase. In one embodiment, the solid phase binding group 40 is at or near the 5′ end 32 of the second adapter segment 14, however, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, the solid phase binding group 40 can be anywhere on the capture probe 10 other than at or near the 5′ end 32 of the second adapter segment 14. In one embodiment, the solid phase binding group 40 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase covalently. In another embodiment, the solid phase binding group 40 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase non-covalently. In one embodiment, the solid phase binding group 40 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase reversibly. As used in this context, “reversibly” means that the solid phase binding group 40 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase in such a way that the solid phase binding group 40 can be disassociated from the solid phase without destruction of the capture probe 10 and without disruption of hybridization between the capture probe 10 and the ligated first linker 48-miRNA of interest 42-second linker 50 (as disclosed below). In another embodiment, the solid phase binding group 40 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase non-reversibly. For example, in one embodiment, the solid phase binding group 40 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase non-covalently and reversibly, where the solid phase binding group 40 comprises biotin or an analog of biotin capable of binding with avidin or streptavidin or functional analogs of avidin or streptavidin with high affinity, such as with an affinity having an affinity constant of between about 10e12 and 10e20. Additionally for example, in one embodiment the solid phase binding group 40 of the second adapter segment 14 immobilizes the capture probe 10 to a solid phase covalently and non-reversibly, where the solid phase binding group 40 comprises a terminal 3′ primary amino group at the 5′ end 32 of the second adapter segment 14 for coupling to a solid phase surface having free carboxyl groups using standard carbodiimide chemistry, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure. Further, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, any solid phase binding group 40 present in the second adapter segment 14, and any technique for coupling the solid phase binding group 40 to a solid phase used in connection with the present method should not interfere with the hybridization and capture of the miRNA of interest to the miRNA binding segment 16, or with any other step of the present method. In another embodiment, both the first adapter segment 12 comprises a solid phase binding group 28, and the second adapter segment 14 comprises a solid phase binding group 40. In another embodiment, both the first adapter segment 12 comprises a solid phase binding group 28 at or near the 3′ end 18 of the first adapter segment 12, and the second adapter segment 14 comprises a solid phase binding group 40 at or near the 5′ end 32 of the second adapter segment 14. Referring again to FIG. 1 and as stated above, the capture probe 10 of the present invention further comprises an miRNA binding segment 16.

In one embodiment, the miRNA binding segment consists of between 18 and 24 DNA residues. In another embodiment, the miRNA binding segment 16 consists of 18 or 19 or 20 or 21 or 22 or 23 or 24 residues selected from the group consisting of DNA, RNA, chimeric DNA/RNA, DNA analogs and RNA analogs. The miRNA binding segment 16 is substantially complementary to, and capable of hybridizing to, one or more than one miRNA of interest by Watson-Crick base pairing, including an miRNA of interest having a predetermined sequence or having a predetermined size, from a sample. In one embodiment, the sample comprises substances that are chemically related, such as for example, a mixture of messenger RNAs, transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and genomic DNA.

Generally, the data collected on the sequences of miRNAs by the Sanger Institute include species, source, corresponding genomic sequences and genomic location (usually chromosomal coordinates), as well as full length transcription products and sequences for the mature fully processed miRNA (miRNA with a 5′ terminal phosphate group). To select the sequence or sequences of the miRNA binding segment 16, an miRNA of interest, or set of miRNAs of interest is selected from a suitable source, such as for example, the Sanger Institute database or other suitable database, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure. If a set of miRNAs of interest is selected from one or more than one source that contains duplicate entries for one or more than one miRNA, in a preferred embodiment, the duplicated entries are first removed so that the set of sequences of miRNAs of interest contains only one sequence for each miRNA of interest. In one embodiment, the set of miRNAs of interest consists of one of each miRNA from a single source or database, including a public source or public database, such as one of each miRNA listed in the central repository provided by the Sanger Institute.

In another embodiment, the miRNA of interest consists of 18 or 19 or 20 or 21 or 22 or 23 or 24 RNA residues. The miRNA of interest 42 is substantially complementary to, and capable of hybridizing to, an miRNA binding segment 16 of a capture probe 10 according to the present invention by Watson-Crick base pairing. In one embodiment, the miRNA of interest 42 is listed in a public database.

Next, the method further comprises providing a capture probe 10. In one embodiment, the capture probe 10 provided is a capture probe 10 according to the present invention. When the capture probe 10 is a capture probe 10 according to the present invention, in all respects, the capture probe 10 provided has the characteristics and attributes as disclosed for a capture probe 10 according to the present invention, some of which will be repeated hereafter for clarity. The capture probe 10 has a capture probe sequence, and comprises three segments: a) a first adapter segment 12 having a first adapter segment sequence, and comprising a 3′ end 18 and a 5′ end 20; b) a second adapter segment 14 having a second adapter segment sequence, and comprising a 3′ end 30 and a 5′ end 32; and c) an miRNA binding segment 16 having an miRNA binding segment sequence, and comprising a 3′ end 22 and a 5′ end 34, where the 5′ end 20 of the first adapter segment 12 is connected to the 3′ end 22 of the miRNA binding segment 16, and where the 5′ end of the miRNA binding segment 34 is connected to the 3′ end 30 of the second adapter segment 14. The specificity of the miRNA binding segment 16 to the miRNA of interest 42 allows the method to be used directly on a sample containing substances related to miRNA or on isolated total RNA without requiring the specific separation of miRNAs from the sample or from the total RNA, such as for example by either gel purification or chromatographic purification, as necessary in prior art methods. In one embodiment, the capture probe 10 provided is a set of capture probes, where each of the set of capture probes provided have capture probe sequences that are identical to one another.

Next, the tube was briefly pulsed in a centrifuge to mix the components. Then, the tube was left at room temperature for 10 minutes with occasional inversion of the tube to further mix the components, at which time hybridization of the miRNA SEQ ID NO:33 to the capture probe, SEQ ID NO:25, was essentially total, producing a “capture probe with hybridized miRNA.” Next, the capture probe with hybridized miRNA was coupled to a solid phase As indicated above, the capture probe portion, SEQ ID NO:25, of the capture probe with hybridized miRNA was biotinylated at the 5′ end. The capture probe with hybridized miRNA was coupled to a solid phase of streptavidin-coated, paramagnetic beads by adding 20:1 of Streptavidin MagneSphere® paramagnetic particles (Promega Corp.) to the 2.0 metal laminate 30 tube containing the capture probe with hybridized miRNA. Then, the tube was placed on a small tube rotator (Glas-Col, L.L.C.; Terre Haute, Ind. US) set at 20% for 30 minutes at room temperature, resulting in “capture probe with hybridized miRNA bound to the solid phase.” Next, the capture probe with hybridized miRNA bound to the solid phase was separated from the remaining components in the tube by adding a magnet assembly to the cap of the tube, and inverting the tube with the magnet assembly in order to collect the capture probe with hybridized miRNA bound to the solid phase in the cap. The tube with magnet assembly was placed upright to permit fluid to drain from the cap, and then, the magnetic cap assembly was placed on a new 2.0 metal laminate 30 tube containing 200:1 of Wash Buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, 10 mM EDTA pH 8, and 0.1% LiDS). Next, the capture probe with hybridized miRNA bound to the solid phase was resuspended in the Wash Buffer A by removing the magnet from the cap and gently flicking the tube. Once resuspended, the entire volume was transferred to a 0.45 micron Lida filter spin column (Nalge Nunc International) that was placed in a 1.5 metal laminate 30 collection tube. Then, the filter spin column in the collection tube containing the capture probe with hybridized miRNA in Wash Buffer A was centrifuged at 1,000×g for 1 minute, the flow through discarded, and the filter spin column placed back in the collection tube. Next, the capture probe with hybridized miRNA was washed by adding 100:1 of the Wash Buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, and 10 mM EDTA) to the filter spin column in the collection tube, followed by spinning the filter spin column for 1 minute at 1,000×g. The flow through was discarded and the filter spin column containing the capture probe with hybridized miRNA was placed back in the collection tube. To facilitate downstream analysis, a first linker having a first linker sequence of (5′-3′) taatacgactcactataggg, SEQ ID NO:36, which comprised a T7 promoter sequence, and a second linker having a second linker sequence of (5′-3′) tctatagtgtcacctaaat, SEQ ID NO:37, which comprised a SP6 promoter sequence which was phosphorylated at the 5′ end, were hybridized, respectively, to the first adapter segment and second adapter segment of the capture probe portion of the capture probe with hybridized miRNA; and the 3′ end of the first linker was ligated to the 5′ end of the miRNA that was hybridized to the capture probe, and the 5′ end of the second linker was ligated to the 3′ end of the miRNA that was hybridized to the capture probe, producing a “complex” of a strand of first linker, miRNA and second linker that were ligated together (“strand of ligated first linker-miRNA-second linker”), where the strand is hybridized to the capture probe. Hybridization and ligation of the first linker and second linker was performed by adding 20:1 of ligation reaction mix 1× rapid ligase buffer (Promega Corp.), 5 pmol of first linker, SEQ ID NO:36, (Integrated DNA Technologies), 5 pmol of second linker, SEQ ID NO:37, (Integrated DNA Technologies), and 1 unit of T4 polynucleotide ligase (Promega Corp.) and 25% glycerol) to the filter spin column in the collection tub, and allowing the mixture to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then, the reaction was stopped by adding 200:1 of Wash Buffer B and spinning at 1,000×g for 1 minute. The flow through was discarded, and the filter spin column was placed back into the collection tube. Next, in order to digest and remove excess first linkers, SEQ ID NO:36, and second linkers, SEQ ID NO:37, 20:1 of ExoSAP-IT™ (USB Corp.; Cleveland, Ohio US) digest mix containing 17:1 of sterile DI H2O, 1:1 of ExoSAP-IT™ and 2:1 of 10×PCR Buffer (Applied Biosciences; Foster City, Calif. US) was added to each tube and placed in a 37EC incubator for 30 minutes. The digested product was washed off and removed by adding 200:1 of Wash Buffer B to each tube, and centrifuging the tube at 1,000×g for 1 minute. The flow through was discarded, and the filter spin column was placed back into the collection tube. Then, the capture probe, SEQ ID NO:25, was dehybridized from the strand of ligated first linker-miRNA-second linker by adding 20:1 of elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) that had been pre-heated to 80EC to the filter spin column, and incubating the filter spin column for 1 minute at room temperature. Next, the filter spin column was spun at 1,000×g for 1 minute. The flow through containing the strand of ligated first linker-miRNA-second linker was removed from the collection tube and placed into a new 1.5 metal laminate 30 screw cap tube (Starstedt, Inc.), and then stored in a −80EC freezer until further use, completing the method for isolating miRNAs. Example II Method for Identifying miRNAs According to one embodiment of the present invention, the method for identifying microRNAs (miRNAs) was performed as follows. First, an miRNA having an miRNA sequence of SEQ ID NO:33 was isolated as part of a strand of the ligated first linker-miRNA-second linker, as disclosed in Example I. Next, a cDNA copy of the ligated first linker-miRNA-second linker was made by reverse transcription. Reverse transcription was performed by, first, annealing an SP6 primer, (5′-3′) CGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG, SEQ ID NO:38 (Integrated DNA Technologies) to the ligated first linker-miRNA-second linker, by adding 5:1 of the ligated first linker-miRNA-second linker to 1:1 of 100 pmol of the SP6 primer, 1:1 of dNTP mix containing 100 mM of each dNTP (Promega Corp.), and 7:1 of sterile DI H2O. These components were put into a 0.7 metal laminate 30 PCR reaction tube (Applied Biosystems) and placed on an MJ Research Thermocycler (Bio-Rad Inc.; Hercules, Calif. US) using calculated control and heated lid at 65 EC for 5 minutes, and then immediately placing the tube on ice for 1 minute. While on ice, Superscript™ III (Invitrogen Corp.) reaction mix (4:15× First Strand Buffer, 1:10.1 M DTT, and 1:1 of 200 units/:1 Superscript™ III Reverse Transcriptase) was added to the tube, and then briefly pulsed in a centrifuge to mix the components. Then, cDNA synthesis was performed by incubating the tube on a thermocycler at 50EC for 30 minutes, and heating to 70EC for 15 minutes to terminate the reaction. Next, the cDNA that was synthesized was amplified by PCR. PCR was performed using 5:1 of the cDNA and a PCR buffer containing 10 pmoles each of a forward primer (T7), (5′-3′) TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG, SEQ ID NO:39, and a reverse primer (SP6), (5′-3′) CGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG, SEQ ID NO:38, 10% 10×PCR buffer (PE Biosystems; Foster City, Calif. US), 2 mM MgCl2(PE Biosystems), 2% Dimethyl Sulfoxide (Sigma Aldrich Corp.), 5 mM DTT (Bio-Rad Inc.; Hercules, Calif. US), 200 uM of each dNTP (Promega Corp.), and 0.625 units of TaqGold (PE Biosystems) in a total volume of 20:1. These reaction components were assembled in a 96-well multiplate (Bio-Rad Inc.), and briefly pulsed in a centrifuge to mix components and placed on a thermocycler (Bio-Rad Inc.). Cycling was performed using calculated control and a heated lid with cycles comprising 95° C. for 12 minutes, followed by 30 cycles comprising 95° C. for 30 seconds, 53.5° C. for 20 seconds, 72° C. for 30 seconds, with a final extension at 72° C. for 6 minutes. Then, electrophoresis was performed to determine the quality of the amplicons using 2:1 of PCR product run on precast Nuseive/GTG 3:1 agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (BMA Corp.; Rockland, Me. US). The band observed on the gel was consistent with size and intensity for the expected amplification polynucleotide product. Next, in order to digest excess primers, 5:1 of ExoSAP-IT™ (USB Corp.) digest mix (3.25:1 of sterile DI H2O, 1.5:1 of ExoSAP-IT™ and 0.25:1 of 100× Acetylated Bovine Serum Albumin (Promega Corp.) per 20:1 reaction) was then added to each well. The plates were then briefly pulsed in a centrifuge to mix components, sealed, and placed on the thermocycler. Incubation was performed using block control and a heated lid with cycles comprising 37° C. for one hour, 65° C. for 10 minutes, and 80° C. for 10 minutes. Then, the amplified cDNA was cloned into a vector and allowed to grow. Cloning of the amplified cDNA was performed using Zero Blunt® TOPO® PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen Corp.). 0.5:1 of PCR product was added to 0.8:1 pCR®-Blunt II-TOPO® vector in a 1.5 metal laminate 30 tube (Starstedt, Inc.), briefly pulsed in a centrifuge to mix components, and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Next, 50:1 of competent DH5alpha-T1 cells was added to the tube and placed on a thermocycler using calculated control and heated lid, and a program comprising 4° C. for 30 minutes, 42° C. for 30 seconds, 15° C. for 4 minutes and 4° C. for 10 minutes. After the transformation was complete, 750:1 of CircleGrow® (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, Calif. US) media with 100 ug/metal laminate 30 Ampicillin (Sigma Aldrich Corp.) was added to the transformation reaction. Next, the tubes were placed in a shaker at 200×rpm at 37° C. for 90 minutes. Then, the cloned cDNA was amplified by PCR by, first, lysing 1:1 of the transformed DH5alpha culture with 4:1 of Sterile DI H2O in 0.2 metal laminate 30 PCR strip tubes (Fisher Scientific International, Inc.; Hampton, N.H. US) using the thermocycler programmed to 80° C. for 5 minutes, 95° C. for 5 minutes and 4° C. for 5 minutes. Amplification was conducted using 5:1 of the lysed clone culture and a PCR buffer containing 10 pmoles each of forward primer M13-20, (5′-3′) GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG, SEQ ID NO:40, and the reverse primer M13 REV. (5′-3′) GGAAACAGCTATGACCATGA, SEQ ID NO:41, 10% 10×PCR buffer (PE Biosystems), 2 mM MgCl2 (PE Biosystems), 2% Dimethyl Sulfoxide (Sigma Aldrich Corp.), 5 mM DTT (Bio-Rad Inc.), 200 uM of each dNTP (Promega Corp.), and 0.625 units of TaqGold (PE Biosystems) in a total volume of 20:1. The reaction components were assembled in 96-well multiplate (Bio-Rad Inc.) and briefly pulsed in a centrifuge to mix the components. Cycling was performed using calculated control and a heated lid with cycles comprising 95° C. for 12 minutes, followed by 35 cycles comprising 95° C. for 30 seconds, 59.2° C. for 20 seconds, 72° C. for 30 seconds, with a final extension at 72° C. for 6 minutes. Then, electrophoresis was performed to determine the quality of the amplicons using 2:1 of PCR product run on precast Nuseive/GTG 3:1 agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (BMA Corp.). The band observed on the gel was consistent with size and intensity for the expected amplification polynucleotide product. Next, in order to digest excess primers, 5 l of ExoSAP-IT™ (USB Corp.) digest mix (3.25 l of sterile DI H2O, 1.5 l of ExoSAP-IT™ and 0.25 l of 100× Acetylated Bovine Serum Albumin (Promega Corp.) per 20 l reaction) was then added to each well. The plates were then briefly pulsed in a centrifuge to mix components, sealed, and placed on the thermocycler. Incubation was performed using block control and a heated lid with cycles comprising 37E C for one hour, 65EC for 10 minutes, and 80EC for 10 minutes. Then, the amplified cDNA was sequenced using 3:1 of each amplicon, 1.4 pmoles each of primer SEQ ID NO:40 and SEQ ID NO:41, and 2:1 of BigDye Terminator Ready Reactions mix version 3.0® (Applied Biosystems) per 10:1 reaction. The reactions were set up using each PCR primer in both the forward and reverse orientation. The reaction components were assembled in MJ Research 96-well Multiplate and briefly pulsed in a centrifuge to mix. Cycling was performed using calculated control and a heated lid with cycles comprising 95° C. for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles comprising 95° C. for 30 seconds, 55° C. for 20 seconds, and 60° C. for 4 minutes. The finished sequence reaction plate was pulsed in a centrifuge and 1 unit of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB Corp.) was added to each well. The plate was pulsed again and incubated at 37EC for 30 minutes. Next, 10:1 of 10% 1-Butanol was added to each well. The plate was then pulsed to mix and samples were transferred to a Sephadex® (Sigma Chemical Corp.) matrix for dye removal. The Sephadex® matrix was constructed by filling the wells of a 45:1 Multiscreen Column Loader® (Millipore Corp.; Billerica, Mass. US) inverting it into a Multiscreen Plate® (Millipore) and filling each well with 300:1 DI H2O followed by placement at 4EC for a minimum of 24 hours prior to use to allow the gel to completely swell. Before use, excess water was spun out of the plate by centrifugation at 900×g for 5 minutes using the 52096 rotor on an Allegra™ 21 Centrifuge (Beckman Coulter Inc.; Fullerton, Calif. US). After samples were transferred to the Sephadex® matrix, a MicroAmp Optical 96-well Reaction Plate (Applied Biosystems) was placed under the Sephadex® plate and the cleaned samples were collected by spinning the two plates again at 900×g for 5 minutes. The plate containing the collected samples, was spun in a SpeedVac® (Telechem International, Inc.) until completely dried. 10:1 of DI Formamide was added to each well and the plate was cycled on a thermalcycler at 95° C. for 5 minutes, 80° C. for 5 minutes, and 4° C. for 5 minutes to resuspend and denature the cDNA. Then, the plate was placed on an ABI Prism® 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using Dye Set “H,” mobility file “DT3700Pop5(BDv3)v1.mob,” cuvette temperature 48EC, injection time 2000 seconds, and injection temperature 45 EC. Sequences were then analyzed using Sequencher 4.5 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, Mich. US) for basecalling and contig alignment. Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown a sequence trace of the cDNA, indicating that the miRNA (hsa-miR-138), SEQ ID NO:33 was successfully isolated and identified by the methods of the present invention. Using techniques corresponding to the above examples, all of the eight capture probes of the capture probes SEQ ID NO:13, and SEQ ID NO:21 through SEQ ID NO:27 were evaluated in a variety of different combinations with one another with respect to their ability to isolate their corresponding synthesized miRNAs, SEQ ID NO:28 through SEQ ID NO:35, and the capture probes were found to be both selective and specific for the isolation of their corresponding synthetic miRNAs according to the present invention.
