This invention relates to centrifugal dust-collecting units such as are employed for removing dust and grit from flue gases in industrial plant. Centrifugal dust collectors are already known in which the dust-laden gas is caused to whirl rapidly around the axis of a substantially cylindricM casing, whereby owing to centrifugal action, most of the dust becomes concentrated in a relatively smallquantity of gas adjacent the curved outer boundary wall of the casing and is discharged through an opening in that wall; the remainder of the whirling gas is comparatively free from dust and is caused to flow past a set of vanes which are arranged in the form of a cylinder co-axial with a central cleaned gas outlet and are so inclined to the direction of the gas flow at any point that the gas can only escape between them by suffering an abrupt change of direction. In fact, in such a form of construction, the vanes are so arranged that the gas ,which escapes between them has been deflected backwardly from the direction of the main whirling flow at any point. Dust particles however, owing to their inertia, cannot follow the sudden change of direction made by the individua,1 gas flows in escaping between the vanes, and the dust particles are hurled outwardly or else glance off the vanes into the main whirling flow of gas. It is also known, in this connection, to employ a secondary dust collector of the cyclone type which is supplied with the dust discharged with a relatively small quantity of gas from the primary separator. The purpose of the present invention is to improve the e ciency of dust collectors which function in the way outlined above, and the invention is based on the results of tests which have established the following facts :-- (a) The mean velocity of the gas escaping between the vanes must be low, and the velocity of the gas whirling along past .the vanes must be high. (b) The individual streams of gas which occur between the vanes must follow a sharp bend upon first entering between the vanes. (c) For a giv.en loading of the collector, the mean velocity of thc stream of gas between the vanes depends upon the outlet area, but the velocity of swirling along the vanes depends upon Prioe: ONE RUPEE. the velocity with which the gas enters the inlet of the collector. Thus, the cleaned gas outlet area (i.e., the sum of the openings between the vanes) must be larger than the inlet area of the collector (i.e., the area of the inlet duct for the dustladen gas). The outlet area should be at least twice, and preferably three or four times as great as the inlet area. (d) The vaned area of the cleaned gas outlet must be at least three times, and preferably eight to twelve times the cross-sectional area of the inlet duct of the separator. The vaned area in question is defined as the area of the cylindrical or other curved surface formed by the vanes and is therefore represented by the product of the height of the vanes and the circumference of the outer circle formed by the vanes. According to the invention, m a centrifugal dust-collecting unit which has at least one substantially cylindrical casing constituting a primary separator in which dust-laden gas is subjected to rapid whirling motion about the axis of the casing so that most of the dust becomes concentrated adjacent the curved bounding wall and is discharged through an opening in that wall, and which has a vaned outlet for the cleaned gas constituted by vanes so arranged that the gas which escapes between them has been deflected backwardly from the direction of the whirling main gas flow at any point, the vaned area of the said cleaned gas outlet is arranged to be at least three tin 1 es the cross-sectional area of the inlet of the collecting unit. Preferably, a secondary collector of the cyclone type is arranged to receive the dust discharged from the primary separator. The seconda W collector may in part be built into the bottom of the casing of the primary separator, the arrangement being such that the dust discharged through the opening in the primary separator enters the secondary collector tangentially. In a construction ir which the dust-laden gas enters the primary separator through an axial inlet the whirling motion of the dust-laden gas is established by means of a fan located in the axial inlet. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which :-- 'Jgure 1 is an elevation, partly in section of a dust-collecting unit embodying the principles of the invention, figure 2 is a sectional plan view of the unit shown in Figure 1, Figure 3 is a sectional elevation of another form of construction having a primary separator and a secondary collector, Figures 4 and 5 are sections on the lines IV--IV and V--V respectively of Figure 3, 'Figure 6 is a sectional elevation of a further form of construction, and Figurers 7 and 8 are sections on the lines VII--VII and VIII--VIII .: respectively of Figure 6. Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, the dust-collecting unit has a substantially cylindrical casing 1 to which dust-laden gas is supplied through a tangential inlet 2 of rectangular cross-section. Vanes 3 are mounted vertically inside the casing 1 around the entire circumference of a circle, so that a vaned cylinder is formed, tbe vanes being mounted between coned members 4 5 which are fixed respectively to the top and bottom of the casing 1. The cylinder formed by the vanes 3 is co-axiM with an outlet 6, for the cleaned gas, which may be a stack for flue gases. The stack is fitted with internal reinforcing members 7. The dust-laden gas, entering through the inlet 2, whirls around the casing 1 and owing to the action of centrifugal force the dust is concentrated in a relatively small quantity of gas along the outer wa!l of the easing. This dust escapes through an opening 8 which may lead to any convenient receptacle but preferably leads tangentially into a secondary collector 9 of the cyclone type. This collector has an outlet 10 for the cleaned gas, and an outlet 11 for the dust. The main part of the gas in the casing 1, which only carries a small remount of dust escapes by passing between the vanes 3 which may be flat or curved and are inclined so that the gas at any point must undergo an abrupt change of direction in order to pass between them, as indicated by the curved arrow A in Figure 2. It will be realised that the gas which escapes between the vanes is deflected backwardly from the direction of the main whirling flow at any point. Owing to their inertia the dust particles do not follow the sudden change of direction experienced by the gas and they are either hurled outwardly into the main gas flow or else they glance off the vanes 3 into it. Consequently, the gas which escapes between the vanes and proceeds to the outlet 6 is substantially free from aH dust. In accordance with the invention, the area of the envelope (i.e., the area represented by the product of the height of the vaned cylinder 3 and its outer circumference) is made at least three times, and preferably from eight to twelve times, the area of cross-section of the inlet 2. Moreover, the total areu of the openings between the vanes 3 is made three or four times as great as the area of cross-section of the inlet 2. The width of the openings between the vanes 3 should be small so that the width of the individual streams of gas escaping through the openings is also small. The velocity of the main gas flow sweeping past the vanes 3 is high but the velocity of the individual streams of gas escaping between the vanes 3 is low. ]n the form of construction shown in Figures 3 to 5 the dust-laden gas again enters through a tangential inlet 2 of a primary dust separator generally similar to that shown in Figures land 2 and, if desired, the casing 1 of the primary separator shown in Figures 3 and 4 may be built around a chimney stack constituting the outlet for the cleaned gas. The action which takes place in the primary separator 1 is the same as already described in connection with Figures 1 and 2, but the opening 8 for the dust-laden gas in t]ae case of the construction shown in Figures 3 to 5 leads into a passage 12 which communicates with the inlet 13 of a secondary collector 14. This secondary collector is fitted with a cleaned gas outlet 15 which it will be seen is arranged coaxially inside the vaned cylinder 3 of the primary separator. The dust-laden gas is led tangentially into the secondary collector 14 by means of guide vanes 16 The dust which is carried into the secondary collector 14 moves outwardly under centrifugal action and gradually falls down the walls of this collector until it is finally discharged at the outlet 17. The cleaned gas escapes through the outlet 15 and so passes to the final outlet 6. The relation between the vaned area 3 and the area of the inlet 2 is the same as already defined in connection with Figures I and 2. A further feature of the construction shown in Figures 3 to 5 is that the secondary collector 14 is partly built into the lower part of the primary separator. In the form of dust-collecting unit shown in Figures 6 to 8 the dust-laden gas enters the casing !8 of a primary separator through an axial inlet 19. The dust-laden gas is drawn in by a fan, the blades 20 of which are mounted on a shaft 21 driven by any convenient means. Curved guide members 22 arranged co-axially are provided as shown for distributing the gas evenly to the fan. A series of stationary curved vanes 23 is mounted co-axially ith the inlet 19 and these vanes are arranged so that they form a frusto-conical surface. These vanes are inclined so that the gas whirling around the casing 18 has to undergo an abrupt change of direction in order to escape between them. The gas which does escape in this way is practically entirely free from dust and passes to a cleaned gas outlet 24. The casing 18 is provided with two slots 25 through which the majority of the dust whirling around the outer wa l of the casing escapes through a passage 26 (Figalre 8) which leads tangentially into a secondary dust collector 27 of the cyclone trope. This collector has a cleaned gas outlet 28 leading through a passage 29 into the outlet 24 of the primary separator. Although only one secondary collector is shown in Figure 8 an exactly similar collector would in practice be connected to the opposite side of the casing 18, namely on the left hand side of Figure 7. In this form of construction the inlet area of the primary separator is represented by the outlet area of the fan but as the gas does not leave this fan radially the required area cannot be calculated directly. Experience has shown that the absolute velocity of gas flow at the outlet of the fan is abon.t twice the velocity in the inlet duct 19. Therefore, the effective inlet area of the separator is defined as half the inlet nrea of the fan. That is to say, in accordance with the invention the area of the enve!ope of the vaned surface 23 must be at least three times half the inlet area of the fan. We claim: l. A centrifugal dust-collecting unit which has at least one substantially cylindrical casing constituting a primary separator in which dust-laden gas is subjected to rapid whirling motion about the axis of the casing so that most of the dust becomes concentrated adjacent the curved bounding wall and is discharged through an opening in that wall, and which has a vaned outlet for the cleaned gas constituted by vanes so arranged that the gas which escapes between them has been deflected backwardly from the direction of the whirling main gas flow at any point, wherein the vaned area of the said cleaned gas outlet is at least three times the cross-sectional area of the inlet of the collecting unit. 2.
