CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION The present invention claims priority of the provisional patent application No 61/968,714 filed on 03/21/2014; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention generally relates to amusement devices and more particularly to multipurpose recreational toy for converting a balloon to an item used in sports. 2. Description of Related Art A balloon is a flexible bag that can be inflated with gas. Balloons or air filled balls are recreational and amusement devices for children of all ages and are suitable for many activities. The use of balloons has long been known in the prior art. Balloons are used in many occasions as decorations for example, at children's birthday parties. Balloons are used for wide range of applications as balloons are low in density and cost. However, balloons mainly serve to provide only decorative effect and are rarely used in games in which the user can participate actively. Also, the balloons are getting boring, and there exists a need to make the recreational balloons which are interactive and usable in different fields. With rapid development in the society, children spend more time on indoor games and sometimes ignore the importance of their health. Exercise is a key to attain a healthy life and play balls are most popular form of exercise. Playing with balls becomes entertaining when people play together. While children are fascinated by the athletic balls like volleyballs, footballs, basketballs, soccer balls and other ball games. But, these conventional athletic balls are heavy and dangerous for the children, especially for indoor play. The inflated athletic balls have a relatively large diameter with hard outer casing which makes it very difficult for a small child to either grasp, throw, catch, kick, or for performing other playing activities. Therefore, there exists a need of an amusement ball which is light and soft but also is potentially safe for young children. Further, there is a need to provide a multipurpose recreational toy which converts a balloon to an item used in sports. Furthermore, the multipurpose recreational toy enables sports-related performance by creating a weighted framework to match the weight of the item used in sports. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a multipurpose recreational toy for converting a balloon into an item used in sports. An object of the present invention is to provide a multipurpose recreational toy which includes an outer ring mounted on the exterior side of the balloon and plurality of support bars attached to the outer ring for forming a weighted framework to match the weight of the item used in sports. A further object of present invention is to provide the support bars that includes one or more horizontal bars attached to the outer ring and one or more vertical bars attached to the horizontal bars for forming a weighted framework to match the weight of the item used in sports. The support bars may further include one or more angular bars connected to the one or more horizontal bars and connected to the one or more vertical bars. Further, the support bars includes one or more inner ring co-axially oriented with the outer ring and furthermore connected to at least one of the one or more horizontal bars; the one or more vertical bars; and the one or more angular bars for forming a weighted framework to match the weight of the item used in sports. Furthermore, an object of present invention is to provide the support bars that forms honeycomb-like pattern with the outer ring for forming a weighted framework to match the weight of the item used in sports. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide multipurpose recreational toy that includes the outer ring and the plurality of support bars whose combined weight is equal to or less than about six ounces. The outer ring and the plurality of support bars may be made up of plastic and are semi-spherical shaped for mounting on the exterior side of the balloon. Another object of the present invention is to provide an adhesive unit for attaching the outer ring and the plurality of support bars on the exterior side of the balloon. Another object of the present invention is to provide multipurpose recreational toy for playing a sport. The multipurpose recreational toy includes an inflatable bladder formed of a thin rubber skin, an outer ring mounted on the exterior side of the inflatable bladder and plurality of support bars attached to the outer ring for forming a weighted framework to match the weight of the inflatable bladder with the weight of the item used in the sport.
