The invention relates to the use of Boswellia frereana (commonly known as frankincense) as a medicament; an extract of Boswellia frereana wherein the extract is soluble in an organic solvent and does not comprise boswellic acid; at least one agent of said extract; and a composition derived from Boswellia frereana. The invention further relates to a method for obtaining and therapeutically using said extract, and/or said agent and/or said composition and, particularly, but not exclusively, using said extract, and/or said agent and/or composition as an inhibitor of an inflammatory condition such as, for example, articular cartilage degradation. Boswellia frereana is a natural product of Somalia, Africa. The product can be sourced from a number of suppliers including Simply Incense [Resolve (WSS Ltd t/a), Unit 12, Southwell Business Centre, Crew Lane Industrial Estate, Southwell, Nottinghamshire, NG25 0TX]; A F Suter & Co. ltd. [Unit 1, Beckingham Business Park, Beckingham Road, Tolleshunt Major, Essex, United Kingdom]; and Joseph Flach & Sons Ltd. [Unit 8, Maxwell Road, Woodston Industrial Estate, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, PE2 7HU, ENGLAND] Introduction Articular cartilage degradation is a classical feature of both degenerative and inflammatory arthritides e.g. osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). OA is characterised by a loss of the proteoglycans and collagen in the extracellular matrix (ECM), and these catabolic events are primarily mediated by the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs 1, 3, 9, and 13 (1-6)) and aggrecanases (ADAMTS-4 and -5 (6-8)). The differential expression of these catabolic enzymes is related to the level of inflammatory mediators and cytokines in the OA joint. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are key mediators in driving ECM destruction. In addition to inducing the synthesis of MMPs and aggrecanases, IL-1 and TNF-α also stimulate production of nitric oxide, via inducible nitric oxide synthase, and increase the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), by stimulating the expression of PGE2 synthase and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2). The incidence of OA is prevalent in an ageing or obese population; there are estimates of 100 million people with OA in the European Union (9), and in the United States, the burden of clinical OA has risen to nearly 27 million people in 2007 (10). Relieving pain and stiffness, improving physical function and delaying disease progression are important therapeutic goals for managing OA. Non-opioid analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and intra-articular therapies are currently prescribed; continued use of NSAIDs has been associated with G.I. tract bleeding, and an increased risk of other adverse side effects (11), making them far from ideal for treating a chronic pathology. Therefore, identifying other potential pharmaceutical agents which may be used to alleviate the symptoms associated with OA, whilst remaining efficacious and non-toxic, is an ongoing pursuit. However, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the medicament described herein has application in the treatment of any inflammatory condition in which MMP9, PGE2 and NO are elevated or which are Interleukin-1 mediated such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), sepsis, sepsis syndrome, osteoporosis, ischemic injury, graft vs. host disease, reperfusion injury, asthma, diabetes, cancer, myelogenous and other leukemias, psoriasis and cachexia, Alzheimer's Disease, demyelinating neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis, retinal disorders, neurological, retinal, and muscular disorders. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of compounds derived from herbs in alleviating the symptoms of a variety of diseases such as OA, breast and prostate cancer, neuronal plasticity/memory loss, encephalomyelitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Preparations from the oleo resin of the Boswellia genus (other than B. frereana), commonly known as frankincense, have been identified as potent anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic and anti-analgesic agents (recently reviewed in (15, 16)). Traditionally, Boswellia serrata species has been used extensively in treating conditions which are either initiated by or maintained by inflammatory events, including collagenous colitis (17), Crohn's disease (18), and both rheumatoid (19, 20) and osteoarthritis (21-23). The studies demonstrated that B. serrata had some efficacy in treating these inflammatory conditions. In two different animal models of arthritis (carrageenan-induced and antigen-induced), topical administration of B. serrata to the site of inflammation reduced rat paw edema by approximately 50% (20). The main pharmacologically active ingredients of B. serrata are α- and β-boswellic acids (24), and Singh et al intimated that the α- or β-boswellic acid was able to act in both early and late phases of inflammation (20). B. serrata is believed to exert its anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase in a selective, enzyme-linked non-redox and non-competitive manner (25), and by inhibiting COX-1 activity (26). Recently, the efficacy of 5-Loxin®, a novel B. serrata extract enriched with 30% 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid, has been tested in human clinical trials for the treatment of knee OA (23). Significant improvements in pain score and functional ability, and a reduction in synovial fluid MMP 3 were observed (23). Apart from B. serrata (native to India), other members of the Boswellia family have also been identified including B. sacra (native to Arabian peninsula) and B. carteri (27) and frereana (native to Africa). Our work has shown that B. frereana does not contain boswellic acid (alpha or beta), the main pharmacologically active ingredient of B. Serrata, it is therefore surprising to discover that B. frereana is effective as an anti-inflammatory and interesting to discover that this anti-inflammatory effect operates via a different pathway to that used by other members of the Boswellian genus. Indeed we have discovered that the pharmacologically active component(s) of B. frereana operates, at least partly, via the suppression, deactivation or inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). Additionally, we have also discovered that B. frereana inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity and so this makes it useful for treating neurological disorders where inhibition of acetylcholinesterase is of benefit, such as Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, we have also shown that B. frereana is effective at killing cancer cells and so this makes it useful for treating cancer, in particular breast cancer. Statements of Invention According to a first aspect, the invention concerns Boswellia frereana for use as a medicament. Preferably the medicament is used to treat or prevent an inflammatory disorder such as, but not limited to, articular cartilage degradation or arthritides for example osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. More preferably still, the medicament is used to treat any one or more of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), all forms of muscular dystrophy especially Duchenne muscular dystrophy, sepsis, sepsis syndrome, osteoporosis, ischemic injury, graft vs. host disease, reperfusion injury, asthma, diabetes, cancer, myelogenous and other leukemias, psoriasis and cachexia, Alzheimer's Disease, demyelinating neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis, Acetylcholinesterase disorders, retinal disorders, neurological, retinal, and muscular disorders. Ideally the individual suffering from the inflammatory disorder or said condition is a mammal and most preferably a primate or grazing animal such as a bovine, ovine, equine, or porcine, alternatively the individual is a feline, canine or rodent. Most preferably the individual is a human. There is also provided the use of Boswellia frereana in the preparation of an agent for the treatment or prevention of the disorders or conditions set out above. The invention also provides a method for the treatment or prevention of the disorders or conditions set out above, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of Boswellia frereana. Ideally the patient is a mammal and most preferably a primate or grazing animal such as a bovine, ovine, equine, or porcine, alternatively the individual is a feline, canine or rodent. Most preferably the individual is a human. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an extract of Boswellia frereana wherein said extract is soluble in organic solution and comprises one or more of: a) an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9),b) an inhibitor of NO synthesis,c) an inhibitor of PGE2 synthesis; andd) said extract does not affect the 5-lipoxygenase pathway; ande) said extract does not comprise alpha or beta boswellic acid. In the context of the present invention the term "extract of Boswellia frereana" refers to a mixture of components which are present in the oleo-resin of Boswellia frereana and which are soluble in a suitable organic solvent. The extract may be obtained by mixing the gum resin with the solvent and leaving for a suitable period of time, for example several days, in a light-free environment so that the soluble components of the gum are extracted into the solvent. Removing any insoluble resin. The solvent may then be removed to leave the extract. For the avoidance of doubt, "extract" does not refer to a single component but to the mixture of components. The solvent may be a polar solvent, typically an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol or a non polar solvent such as hexane. B.frereana is unique in this sense, as in other boswellia species hexane extracts the essential oil fraction (volataile oil) only and, also, in other Boswellia species ethanol isolates the resin fraction only. However, with B.frereana both hexane (non polar) and ethanol (polar) isolate the resin fraction containing 60% epilupeol. However, the extraction may also be carried out using other extraction solvents such as ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, chloroform, methylene chloride, petroleum ether, acetone, pentane, or toluene. Other suitable solvents will be well known to those skilled in the art of plant component extraction. Preferably said extract comprises the pentacyclic triterpene epi-lupeol or a derivative thereof or a salt of any one of these. Epi-lupeol is a diastereisomer of the pentacyclic triterpene lupeol. Diastereomers are defined as stereoisomers that are not enantiomers (i.e non-superimposable mirror images of each other). Diastereomers, sometimes called diastereoisomers generally have different physical properties and different reactivity to their isomers. Other components of the extract comprise β-amyrin, α-amyrin, α-phellandrene dimers, α-thujene and α-phellandrene and their isomers and, where appropriate, salts. More preferably still, the extract has a GC-MS chromatogram as shown in Figure 6. More preferably the main components are epi-lupeol, β-amyrin, and alpha-phellandrene dimer. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided the extract or an agent selected from epi-lupeol, β-amyrin, α-amyrin, α-phellandrene dimers, α-thujene and α-phellandrene; the isomers of these agents other than lupeol; where appropriate, pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salts; and mixtures thereof, for use in medicine, particularly in the treatment or prevention of the inflammatory diseases and conditions set out above. Appropriate pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salts include basic addition salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, zinc, magnesium and other metal salts as well as choline, diethanolamine, ethanolamine, ethyl diamine, megulmine and other well known basic addition salts as summarised in Paulekuhn et al., (2007) J. Med. Chem. 50: 6665-6672 and/or known to those skilled in the art. The invention also provides the use of the extract or an agent selected from epi-lupeol, β-amyrin, α-amyrin, α-phellandrene dimers, α-thujene and α-phellandrene; the isomers of these agents other than lupeol; where appropriate their salts; and mixtures thereof in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of the disorders or conditions as set out above. In yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition comprising the extract of the invention together with a carrier. Generally, the composition will be a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition and the carrier will be a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier. In an alternative aspect, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising an agent selected from epi-lupeol, β-amyrin, α-amyrin, α-phellandrene dimers, α-thujene and α-phellandrene; the isomers of these agents other than lupeol; where appropriate, pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salts; and mixtures thereof; together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other active materials may also be present, as may be considered appropriate or advisable for the disease or condition being treated or prevented. For example, the composition may also contain an antibiotic or antibacterial agent. The carrier, or, if more than one be present, each of the carriers, must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient. The formulations include those suitable for nasal, bronchial (inhaled), topical (including eye drops, buccal and sublingual), parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous intra-articular and intradermal) administration and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Preferred compositions are formulated for intra-articular, intravenous, parenteral, oral, nasal, bronchial or topical administration. The composition may be prepared by bringing into association the extract of the invention and the carrier. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing an extract of the invention in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle. Formulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as: discrete units such as capsules, sachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus etc. For compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term "acceptable carrier" includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent. Other formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier. For topical application to the skin, compounds may be made up into a cream, ointment, jelly, solution or suspension etc. Cream or ointment formulations that may be used for the drug are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard text books of pharmaceutics such as the British Pharmacopoeia. Extracts of the invention may be used for the treatment of the respiratory tract by nasal, bronchial or buccal administration of, for example, aerosols or sprays which can disperse the pharmacological active ingredient in the form of a powder or in the form of drops of a solution or suspension. Pharmaceutical compositions with powder-dispersing properties usually contain, in addition to the active ingredient, a liquid propellant with a boiling point below room temperature and, if desired, adjuncts, such as liquid or solid non-ionic or anionic surfactants and/or diluents. Pharmaceutical compositions in which the pharmacological active ingredient is in solution contain, in addition to this, a suitable propellant, and furthermore, if necessary, an additional solvent and/or a stabiliser. Instead of the propellant, compressed air can also be used, it being possible for this to be produced as required by means of a suitable compression and expansion device. Parenteral formulations will generally be sterile. The precise amount of a extract of the present invention which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for the treatment or prevention of a disorder or condition as set out above, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of: a. an extract of the invention; orb. an agent selected from epi-lupeol, β-amyrin, α-amyrin, α-phellandrene dimers, α-thujene and α-phellandrene; the isomers of these agents other than lupeol; where appropriate, their salts; and mixtures thereof; orc. a composition according to the invention. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for obtaining an extract of Boswellia frereana comprising: a) obtaining oleo-resin from Boswellia frereana;b) exposing said resin to an organic liquid in a light-impermeable environment;c) removing any insoluble resin; andd) removing the solvent to produce Boswellia frereana extract. Removal of the solvent in step (d) may be achieved by evaporation. Alternatively, precipitation of a solid triterpene fraction may be obtained by the addition of water to the organic extraction mixture, ideally, this step is undertaken after removing the insoluble resin. In a preferred method of the invention the resin is exposed to an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol, preferably ethanol, and ideally 100% ethanol. However other organic solvents may also be used such as ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, chloroform, methylene chloride, petroleum ether, acetone, pentane, or toluene. Components of the extract were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent 5973 Network mass selective detector and an Agilent 7683 series autosampler. The extract comprised the pentacyclic triterpene epi-lupeol. Other components of the extract were β-amyrin, α-amyrin, α-phellandrene dimers α-thujene and α-phellandrene. The extract has a GC-MS chromatogram as shown in Figure 6 from which it can be seen that the main components are epi-lupeol, β-amyrin and dimmers of alpha-phellandrene. Optionally, once the extract has been obtained it is dissolved in organic solvent, typically an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol, more usually ethanol and, ideally 100% ethanol at a concentration of about 10mg/ml. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an extract obtainable by the aforementioned method of the invention. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a novel source of a pentacyclic triterpene such as epi-lupeol wherein said source is Boswellia frereana. Moreover the aforementioned source is also a source of β-amyrin, α-amyrin, α-phellandrene dimers, α-thujene and α-phellandrene. Further, the afore method provides a way in which said pentacyclic triterpene and β-amyrin, α-amyrin, α-phellandrene dimers, α-thujene and α-phellandrene can be extracted from the source.

Materials and Methods All reagents were purchased from Sigma (Poole, U.K.) unless otherwise specified. Culture medium consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM glutamax I™/HAMS F12 media (1:1), Invitrogen, UK) supplemented with 100Units/ml penicillin, 100µg/ml streptomycin, 50µg/ml L-ascorbate-2-phosphate and 1X Insulin-Transferrin-Sodium selenite (ITS). Somali frankincense oleoresins, Boswellia frereana (Somali name Maidi) and Boswellia carteri (Somali name Beyo) were procured from Hargeysa in Somaliland (northern Somalia). Ethiopian frankincense (Boswellia papyrifera) was kindly supplied by Mr Abdi Farah (Somaliland Frankincense Company, Cardiff). The solvents absolute ethanol and hexane (analar grade) were purchased from Fischer Scientific (Loughborough). Extraction of Boswellia frereana (For bio-assay) Gum resin from Boswellia frereana was collected and the active component(s) prepared by extracting the gum resin (20g) successively with ethanol (100%) for 7 days in a light-impermeable vessel. Insoluble gum resin was removed by filtration and the solvent evaporated at 60°C. More specifically, a known amount of B. frereana oleoresin (20g) was accurately weighed, placed in a 500ml glass beaker and 100ml of ethanol added. The mixture was stirred with a spatula, covered with aluminum foil and para-film and then left to stand for seven days. The ethanol extract was filtered using a 150ml Express™ Millipore filter. The solvent was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen at a temperature of 60°C. The resulting B. frereana extract was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 10mg/ml to give the working stock and stored at -20°C. The chemical constituents of the B. frereana extracts were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent 5973 Network mass selective detector and an Agilent 7683 series autosampler. (See Figure 6). A scan range of 35 to 450 mass units was used for acquiring the mass spectra data with a sampling time of 2 which corresponds to 3.5 scans per second. Data acquisition was performed using the MSD Chemstation™ computer software. The identification of the individual peaks was conducted by comparing sample mass spectra to those stored in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library database which contains over 54,000 spectra and by comparison of the sample mass spectra to published literature values. National Institute of Standards and Technology is a physical science research laboratory and an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. (website - www.nist.gov). An alternative mass spec. library is commercially available from Wiley (website - www.sisweb.com/software/ms/wiley.htm#wiley8). Chemical Characterisation: Comparison Of The Resin And Gum Content Of Oleoresins B. frereana B. carteri and B. Papyrifera Boswellia oleoresin granules from B. carteri, B. frereana and B.papyrifera, were separately ground to a powder with a mortar and pestle. 40 g of each oleoresin powder was placed in separate 500ml glass beakers and 100ml of absolute ethanol added to each beaker. The mixtures were stirred with a spatula, covered with aluminum foil and para-film and then left to stand for three days. After this time period the ethanol extracts were stirred and then filtered under vacuum, using a 150ml Express™ Millipore filter. The weight of ethanol insoluble gum (polysaccharide) left on each filter was recorded and the filtered ethanol extracts stored at -20°C. Chemical Characterisation: Hexane extraction of B. frereana Gum resin from Boswellia frereana (20g) was extracted using hexane as solvent for 3 days in a light-impermeable vessel. Insoluble gum resin was removed by centrifuging at 2000rpm for 30minutes and the clear supernatant layer removed. The hexane solvent was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen at a temperature of 40°C and stored at -20°C. Chemical Characterisation: Essential Oil Extraction From B. frereana Oleoresins Deionised water (1 litre) was placed in a steam distillation apparatus, via the bottom glass vessel, and 50.6g of B. frereana oleoresin placed in the top glass vessel. The two glass vessels were physically separated only by a perforated metal gauze. The heating mantle was set on maximum power and the water heated to boiling. The distillate (300ml) was collected in a 500ml glass container, 100ml of hexane added and the mixture shaken. The hexane layer (top layer) was removed, transferred to a clean container and the solvent evaporated off under a gentle stream of nitrogen to yield an aromatic yellow oil (0.44g). In vitro model of cartilage degeneration Full-depth articular cartilage (6mm diameter explants) was harvested from the metacarpo-phalyngeal joint of 7-day old bovine calves using a biopsy punch. Cartilage explants were stabilised for 3 days in culture medium prior to treatment. An in vitro cartilage degradation model, as characterised by aggrecan loss and type II collagen proteolysis (29, 30), was established by treating cartilage explants with 5ng/ml human recombinant IL-1α (Peprotech, U.K.) and 10ng/ml human recombinant oncostatin M (OSM; Peprotech, U.K.), in the presence or absence of 100µg/ml B. frereana extract; untreated explants served as a control. Cultures were maintained over a period of 28 days, with replenishment of media and/or treatments every 3 days. Tissue and media were harvested after 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of culture. Cartilage explants were freeze dried over a period of 48 hours and all biochemical data normalised to dry weight of tissue (mg). For mRNA analysis, explants were cultured with the treatments indicated above for 3 days to allow investigation of early gene changes. Explants were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA extraction. Cytotoxicity Assay: Cytotox 96® Cell viability was assessed using the CytoTox 96® non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega) (31). The enzymatic assay quantitatively measures lactate dehydrogenase levels in culture medium as a consequence of cell lysis i.e. through cell death. Culture media (50µl) was pipetted into a 96-well plate and mixed with 50µl reconstituted substrate mix (kit component). After 30 minutes incubation at room temperature avoiding light, absorbance values were determined at 492nm using a plate reader. Analysis of sulphated glycosaminoglycans: Dimethylmethylene Blue (DMMB) assay Sulphated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) levels in the tissue explants and released into the media was determined using the DMMB assay (32). Tissue explants (50mg tissue: 1ml buffer) were placed in digestion buffer (20mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 1mM EDTA, 2mM DTT) containing 300µg papain (non-specific matrix proteinase). Samples were incubated at 60°C for 1 hour, or until the tissue had completely dissolved. 10mM iodoacetamide was added to the samples to alkylate the reactive sulphydryl groups (generated by DTT treatment) and the samples made up to a final volume of 5ml (50mM Tris (pH 8.0). A serial dilution was prepared using whale chondroitin-4-sulphate (sulphate C) with standards ranging from 0 - 50µg/ml. Standards were prepared in the same buffer as the samples under analysis i.e. for media - DMEM-glutamax I™, and for tissue extracts - extraction buffer (50mM Tris (pH 8.0)). 40µl of standards and samples were pipetted in triplicate into a 96-well plate followed by addition of 200µl DMMB reagent (1.6% (w/v) 1,9-Dimethylmethylene Blue, 3% (v/v) sodium hydroxide, 1% (v/v) ethanol, 0.35% (v/v) formic acid). The plate was read immediately at a wavelength of 525nm, and sGAG concentrations determined from reading directly off the standard curve. Any samples with a reading outside the limits of the standard curve were diluted in their respective buffer, the standards pipetted into fresh wells and the samples re-assayed. Analysis of collagen: Hydroxyproline assay The amount of collagen in and released from the cartilage was determined using the hydroxyproline assay using an adaptation of the method by Woessner (31). Briefly, tissue explants and media samples were hydrolysed in 12N or 6N HCl, respectively, at 110°C for 24 hours and samples freeze-dried. A standard curve was prepared by dissolving 4-hydroxyproline in DMEM-glutamax I™ to give a range of 1 - 10µg/ml. Hydrolysates (30µl) and standards were added in triplicate to a 96-well plate followed by 70µl diluent (66% (v/v) isopropanol) and 50µl oxidant (18mM chloramine T, 50% (v/v) stock buffer) before incubation at room temperature for 5 minutes. Colour reagent (3.7mM dimethylamino benzaldehyde, 15% (v/v) perchloric acid, 85% (v/v) isopropanol) was added (125µl) and incubated at 70°C for 40 minutes. The absorbance was detected (540nm) and the hydroxyproline content calculated from the standard curve. Any samples with a reading outside the limits of the standard curve were diluted in their respective buffer, the standards pipetted into fresh wells and the samples re-assayed.Total collagen was calculated by multiplying the hydroxyproline values by a factor of 7.14 (33). Gelatin zymography: Analysis of MMPs 2 and 9 expression/activation The expression and activation of MMPs 2 and 9 were evaluated in experimental media samples by gelatin zymography (34). Media samples were denatured in a doubling dilution sample buffer (60mM Tris (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) Bromophenol Blue) at 60°C for 30 minutes. Briefly, samples were loaded onto a 7.5% (w/v) SDS polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml porcine gelatin (BDH, Poole, UK), and run in 1X Laemmli buffer (25mM Tris, 0.192M glycine, 0.1% SDS) at 150V for approximately 60 minutes or until the dye front was nearing the end of the gel. Samples were loaded on an equivalent dry weight value taking into account differences in the volume of accumulated media over the 28 day culture. Gels were washed 3 times in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS and allow enzyme renaturation. Gels were incubated overnight in MMP proteolysis buffer (50mM Tris (pH 7.8), 50mM CaCl2, 0.5M NaCl) at 37°C to activate latent enzymes. Gels were subsequently stained (0.25% (w/v) Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid, 45% (v/v) methanol) for 1 hour. Cleared zones of gelatinolytic activity were observed upon destaining (7.5% (v/v) glacial acetic acid, 10% (v/v) methanol) for at least one hour or until zones of gelatinolysis were evident. Their relative quantities were analysed by scanning densitometry (UMAX magic scan) and NIH image software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Griess Assay: measurement of nitrite levels Absolute concentrations of nitrite, a stable end-product of NO, were determined in the culture media using the Griess Assay (Promega). A nitrite standard curve was generated using a 0.1 M sodium nitrite stock solution (kit component). The solution was diluted to a concentration of 100µM (using dH2O), and a twofold serial dilution performed (standards ranging from 1.56µM to 100µM). Media samples (50µl) were pipetted in triplicate into a 96-well plate, 50µl of sulphanilamide solution added and the plate incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. NED solution (50µl) was added to each well and the absorbance was detected at a wavelength of 540nm. Nitrite (µM) was determined by comparison with the nitrite standard curve. Any samples with a reading outside the limits of the standard curve were diluted in their respective buffer, the standards pipetted into fresh wells and the samples re-assayed. PGE2 ELISA: measurement of prostaglandin E2 levels PGE2 production was measured in the culture media using a high sensitivity ELISA (PGE2 HS-EIA; Cambridge Biosciences). PGE2 standards were prepared from a 50ng/ml stock solution (kit component) to give a standard curve ranging from 20pg/ml to 640pg/ml. Standards, negative controls and media samples (100µl) were pipetted in triplicate into a 96-well plate followed by the addition of 50µl of PGE2 HS-EIA peroxidise conjugate. PGE2 HS-EIA antibody (50µl) was added to each well and the plate incubated overnight at 4°C. The contents of the plate were removed and the wells washed three times with 400µl wash buffer (kit component). After removal of the wash buffer, 200µl of pNpp substrate was added to each well and the absorbance measured at a wavelength of 450nm using a plate reader. Absorbances were standardised by subtracting the absorbance of the negative control. A logarithmic plot of PGE2 standards versus absorbance was performed, and the concentration of PGE2 in the samples calculated. Any samples with a reading outside the limits of the standard curve were diluted in their respective buffer, the standards pipetted into fresh wells and the samples re-assayed. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and Quantitative PCR analysis Cartilage explants were homogenised in 1ml of Trizol™ Reagent (Invitrogen) in liquid N2 (2000 rpm, 1.5 minutes) using a dismembrator (B. Braun Biotech Int., Germany), total RNA extracted and cDNA generated as previously described (35, 36). Briefly, 175µl chloroform was added to the Trizol™ containing the homogenised cartilage, mixed by inversion several times and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. The RNA-containing phase was collected by centrifuging the samples (14,000rpm, 15 minutes, 4°C) and removing the upper aqueous component to a sterile eppendorf. An equal volume of isopropanol was added to the RNA-containing aqueous phase, the tube inverted several times to mix and the RNA precipitated overnight at -20°C. The RNA was pelleted by centrifuging the samples (14,000rpm, 15 minutes, 4°C); the supernatant was removed and the pellet washed with 1 ml 75% ethanol. The RNA was pelleted by centrifugation (14,000rpm, 5 minutes, 4°C), the supernatant discarded and the RNA-containing pellet air-dried at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes or until the ethanol had completely evaporated. Samples were DNase-treated (1 U DNase, 10% (v/v) DNase buffer) at 37°C for 30 minutes. The residual DNase components were removed by adding 10% (v/v) DNA-later (Ambion) followed by centrifugation (10,000rpm, 2 minutes) to pellet out the contaminants; the RNA remains in the supernatant. First strand cDNA was synthesised (20µl reaction volume) using Superscript™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1µg random primers and 500µM dNTPs were added to 10µl RNA and incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes. After adding 5x first strand buffer, 200mM DTT and 10U recombinant RNase Inhibitor (Promega), the sample was incubated at 42°C for 2 minutes. 200U Superscript™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added to the sample and incubated for 50 minutes at 42°C; the reaction was terminated by heating the sample to 70°C for 15 minutes. Real-time PCR was carried out using an Mx3000® QPCR System (Stratagene). A real-time qPCR assay, based on SYBR Green® detection, was designed for the transcriptional profiling of iNOS, PGE2 synthase, COX-2 (37) and MMP 9 in the cDNA samples, after normalisation to the housekeeping gene 18S (38). Primers were designed to the open reading frame of iNOS, PGE2 synthase and MMP 9 using Primer3 primer design software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3 www.cgi) (Table 1). Briefly, 12.5µl of Sybr® Green Jumpstart™ Taq ReadyMix buffer was added to 100nM of each primer and 1µl cDNA and the reaction made up to a final volume of 25µl with dH2O. Samples and negative controls (omitting cDNA template) were loaded into a 96-well microplate (Stratagene) and the PCR reaction controlled by MxPro™ qPCR software. All reactions were carried out at an annealing temperature of 60°C. Relative quantification was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method as described previously (39, 40), using the untreated controls as a reference group to quantify relative changes in target gene expression. The data are presented as fold change in gene expression normalised to an endogenous reference gene 18S relative to the untreated control cDNA samples. Where there was no amplification of a gene product in the untreated cartilage cDNA samples, the fold change in gene expression was relative to the IL-1α/OSM treated cDNA samples. Statistical analysis Data were normalised to the dry weight of the cartilage explants and presented as mean ± standard error mean (n = 4 explants per treatment). Each experiment was repeated three times and representative data are shown. Data were tested for normality (Anderson-Darling) and equal variances prior to parametric analyses (Minitab). Statistical analysis was performed using a 2-factor generalised linear model ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test, or where indicated in the text using a 2-sample t-test (qPCR analysis). Differences were considered significant at P values less than 0.05. Boswellia Frereana Extracts: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) Inhibition Assay This TLC method for screening AChE activity is based on that reported by Rhee et al. (56) and is a modified version of Ellman's original UV method for determining AChE activity (Ellman et al., 57). Chemicals and Reagents Acetylcholinesterase (AChE, 1000 U) from electric eel , Trizma base, Acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI), 5,5'-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) and Galanthamine hydrobromide were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset). Toluene and ethyl acetate were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, Leicestershire) Preparation of Buffer solution (50mM Tris-HCl at pH 8) 6.057g of Tris base(molecular weight 121.14g) was accurately weighed into a 1 litre volumetric flask. 800ml of deionised water was added, it's pH adjusted to pH8 with concentrated HCl and then diluted to volume with de-ionised water. Buffer was stored at 4°C. Preparation of Acetylthiocholine iodide (2.5mM) / 5,5'-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (2.5 mM) Spray Mixture 72.2 mg of ATCI and 100.8 mg of DTNB were accurately weighed into the same 100ml volumetric flask and diluted to volume with buffer and stored at 4°C. Preparation of Acetycholinesterase enzyme solution (4U/ml) The contents of the AChE vial (1000 U) was transferred to a 250ml volumetric flask and diluted to volume with buffer. Solution was stored at a -20°C until required. Sample Preparation A stock solution of Boswellia frereana ethanol extract (101.6mg/ml) were diluted in ethanol yielding final B. frereana concentrations of 101.6, 50.8, 25.4, 12.7, 6.35 and 3.17 mg/ml. Reference Standard Preparation (1mM) Galanthamine hydrobromide (10mg) was accurately diluted with 27ml of methanol. TLC Plate A silicagel 60 F254 with the dimensions 200mm x 200mm and thickness 0.2mm was purchased from VWR International (West Sussex). TLC Development solvent 90ml of toluene and 10ml of ethylacetate were added together and mixed together. Detection Reagent 0.5ml of anisalaldehyde was transferred to a 100ml volumetric flask and 10ml of glacial acetic acid added. To this 85ml of methanol was added followed by 5ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and then shaken to mix. Procedure 100ul of the Boswellia extracts were applied to the Tlc plates as well as 100ul of galantamine hydrobromide (1mM) as a reference solution. The Tlc plate was developed using toluene and ethyl acetate (90:10) as the solvent. After drying for 30 minutes the plate was sprayed with 20 ml of the substrate/dye mixture (ATCI/DTNB) until saturated. The plate was allowed to dry for 5 minutes before spraying with 20 ml of the enzyme solution and then allowed to dry. The plate was photographed within 10-20 minutes although the white spots remained for 1hour. A positive spot was obtained if a white spot was observed on a yellow background. A control TLC plate (with no samples) was developed, to investigate false positives, and treated as described for the treated TLC plates. TLC components were also detected by spraying developed TLC plates with anisaldehyde solution. Anti-Tumour Properties Of Boswellia frereana Extracts On Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines (MCF-7) Research was carried out using the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (donated by Dr Richard Clarkson, Cardiff University, originally from ECACC). The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was established in 1970 from the pleural effusion from a 69 year old Caucasian female suffering from a breast adenocarcinoma (58). This cell line has been used extensively as an experimental tumour model. Maintenance of MCF-7 cell cultures MCF-7 cells were grown in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (EMEM) with Earle's balanced sat solution without L-glutamine (Lonza) which was supplemented with 1% glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1% insulin (Sigma), 1% Penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen), 10% foetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% non essential amino acids (Lonza) and 1% sodium pyruvate (Ambrex). They were grown in adherent culture using 75cm2 flasks (Costar) at 37°C and in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells were sub-cultured every 7 days and seeded at 2 × 104 cells per cm2. To harvest the cells, first the culture medium was removed. Next the cell layer was gently rinsed with approximately 7ml of 0.25% trypsin with EDTA (Gibco) to remove any remaining growth medium. Then a further 5ml of trypsin/EDTA was added and the flask was incubated for 3 minutes to separate the cells and detach from the surface of the flask. An inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot) was used to check that the cells have detached. 10ml of medium was then added to the flask and gently pipetted up and down to separate the clumps of cells. The cells were counted using a Bright Line haemocytometer cell counting chamber and seeded into flasks containing a total of 20ml of medium each. Flasks were then placed into the incubator to allow cells to stick. Medium was changed once a week. Measurement of cell response using the MTS assay The CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) kit was used to perform the MTS assays. The kit contains 20ml MTS solution and 1ml PMS solution. All MTS assays were performed in 96 well plates (Costar). The cells were seeded at 1.2 × 103 - 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 with 0.1 - 0.2ml of appropriate growth media. Control wells in all cases contained the same volume of medium, the same volume of test reagent and the same volume of MTS solution but contained no cells. The plates were then incubated. Cell suspension and MTS solution were added to the wells using either a repetitive pipette (HandyStep) or a multi-channel pipette and trough (Transferpette). Cell suspension in the trough was regularly stirred with a sterile spatula to avoid cells settling to the surface. 24 - 48 hours after seeding 50µl of test reagent was added as appropriate. 24 - 168 hours after seeding MTS solution was added at 20µl MTS solution per 100µl of medium to the wells with and with out cells. The plates were then returned to the incubator for two hours. Next the plates were removed from the incubator and shaken using an orbital plate shaker (MS1 Minishaker IKA) for ten seconds to ensure the reaction product was evenly distributed in the well. The absorbance was then read at 492nm using either an Anthos reader 2001 (Labtech) plate reader or a FLUOstar OPTIMA (Labtech) plate reader. In the case of the growth curves the medium was changed at 72 hours and every 24 hours following this so that medium depletion would not act as a confounding variable. To remove the medium from the wells a sterile swab was placed on top of the plate which were then both inverted. The medium was absorbed by the sterile swab and any remaining medium was removed by dabbing on another sterile swab. Fresh medium (0.2ml) was then pipetted into all of the test and control wells. Preparation of B. frereana (Boswellia frereana) ethanol extract An ethanol extract of B. frereana (3.01778g) was dissolved in 10ml of absolute ethanol (Fisher Scientific) to give a stock solution of 266.7mg/ml. This was then filtered using a Sartorius PTFE membrane (Fisher Scientific UK) to ensure sterility. The stock solution was diluted in medium to give 3 times the final concentration needed and 50µl of this concentrate was added to wells containing 0.1ml of medium to give a final concentration of 88 - 2000 µg/ml in the well. The samples were then vortexed to disperse the extract in the medium. The ethanol concentration was adjusted to be constant in all wells. The concentration was adjusted to contain the same concentration as the well containing the highest concentration of the B. frereana extract. This ranged from 0.17-0.77%. Non specific background absorbance can occur in culture medium incubated with MTS solution. This was corrected for using control wells which were identical to test wells but contained no cells. The average absorbance from these control wells was subtracted from all other test well absorbance values to yield corrected absorbance. These corrected absorbance values were used to plot formazan absorbance on the graphs. Error bars express standard error of the difference (se(d)) between the test wells and control wells and were calculated using the following equation: se(d) = sqrt (set2 + sec2)se(d) = standard error of the difference;sqrt = square root;set = standard error of the test wells;sec = standard error of the control wells. Calculating LD50 values LD50 values were calculated as the concentration of the B. frereana extract at which there was a 50% reduction in formazan absorbance. Graphs were plotted using the mean formazan absorbance and were displayed as a percentage of the absorbance at 0µg/ml. The LD50 was taken at 50% formazan absorbance at each sampling time (24, 48 and 72 hours after incubation with B. frereana extract) on the curves. This was done for each experiment and the average at each incubation time was recorded in the results. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed in Minitab 15. Two-way ANOVA and three-way ANOVA were performed by means of the general linear model. Tukey simultaneous pair wise comparison was used to compare the means. If the variances were not homogeneous (as verified using the Bartlett's test), a weighted regression was used. The weights used were the reciprocal of the variance (59). Results Surprisingly the B. frereana oleoresin was found to be almost completely soluble in both hexane and ethanol resulting in very high extraction yields for the resin (99%), as indicated in table 2. Tables 2 and 3 indicate that B. frereana oleoresins contain very little ethanol insoluble gum (polysaccharide). This is in contrast to other species of Boswellia such as B.carterii and B.papyrifera, where the ethanol insoluble gum fraction comprised 48% and 51% respectively as shown in table 2. Boswellia oleoresins from India (B. serrata) has also been reported to contain a substantial amount of alcohol insoluble gum fraction, in the region of 24% (55). Unlike the oleoresins from B.carteri, B. serrata and B. papyrifera this particular species of Boswellia (B. frereana) was found not to be amenable to steam distillation due to its low gum content. On contact with the steam the resin softened and completely passed through the perforated gauze and into the hot water. The method for isolation of the essential oil was therefore in actuality one of hydro-distillation rather than steam distillation. The essential oil content of B. frereana, using hydro-distillation was quite low (0.87%) as indicated in table 5. Non-polar solvents such as hexane are commonly used, in phytochemistry, to extract the volatile oil component from oleoresins whilst ethanol is commonly used to extract the more polar resin fraction of oleoresins. We have previously used hexane to isolate the volatile oil component of related aromatic oleoresins such as frankincense (B. carterii, B. papyrifera), Opoponax (Commiphora guidotti) and myrrh (Commiphora molmol) whilst leaving the resin and gum content of the oleoresins intact. Unexpectedly, in this case, hexane is not suitable for the extraction of the volatile oil component of B. frereana as the solvent also extracted the resin component. See figure 7. B. frereana does not affect cartilage chondrocyte viability. Treatment of cartilage explants with 5ng/ml IL-1α and 10ng/ml OSM or 100µg/ml B. frereana, separately or in combination did not significantly affect cell viability over the 28 day culture period (data not shown). B. frereana does not affect sGAG levels in an in vitro model of cartilage degradation. Treatment of explants with 5ng/ml IL-1α and 10ng/ml OSM, separately or in combination with 100µg/ml B. frereana had no effect on sGAG levels in the tissue (Figure 1A). In contrast there was a significant increase in the amount of sGAGs detected in the media of explants treated with IL-1α/OSM relative to those that were left untreated or treated with B. frereana alone (p < 0.01; log transformation required for analysis of days 3 and 7 data). B. frereana did not rescue cytokine-induced sGAG loss from the cartilage explants over the culture period (Figure 1B). B. frereana reduces collagen release in an in vitro model of cartilage degradation. There were no appreciable differences in the amount of collagen measured in the explants across treatments (Figure 2A). Significantly more collagen was released into the media from cartilage explants treated with IL-1a/OSM after 28 days in culture compared to the untreated or B. frereana treated explants (p = 0.001; log transformation). However, there was a significant reduction in collagen released from cartilage explants treated with IL-1a/OSM in combination with B. frereana (p = 0.012; log transformation) returning levels to basal amounts (Figure 2B). B. frereana inhibits cytokine-induced MMP 9 expression and activation, due to a reduction in MMP 9 transcription, in an in vitro model of cartilage degradation. In untreated explants, there was minimal expression of pro-MMP 9 after 7 days, but pro-and active-MMP 2 were observed in both the untreated and B. frereana treated explants (Figure 3A). IL-1α/OSM-stimulated cartilage synthesised significantly higher levels of pro-MMP 9 after 7 days (p < 0.0001; log transformation). Active-MMP 9 was not observed at this time point. Pro- and active-MMP 2 levels did not alter appreciably after IL-1α/OSM stimulation. Interestingly, B. frereana inhibited cytokine-induced pro-MMP 9 synthesis (p < 0.0001; log transformation), but had no effect on the expression or activation of pro-MMP 2. After 28 days in culture, pro-MMP 9 was no longer observed in the untreated cartilage explants, but both pro- and active MMP 2 were present (Figure 3B). These observations were also evident in cartilage treated with B. frereana. Overall, B. frereana abolished cytokine-induced MMP 9 expression and activation. There was a dramatic reduction in the amount of pro-MMP 9 expressed by the explants treated with IL-1a/OSM in combination with B. frereana which was highly significant from day 7 onwards. As a consequence of reduced MMP 9 synthesis, levels of active MMP 9 were abolished bringing expression levels back to that of untreated explants. It also appeared to reduce IL-1α/OSM-mediated pro-MMP 2 expression but this did not reach significance (p = 0.06; log transformation). However, B. frereana did significantly counteract the activation of pro-MMP 2 by IL-1a/OSM (p = 0.04; ranked log transformation). Only media removed from explants after 7 and 28 days have been included in the manuscript to maintain brevity but are representative of the trends observed over all of the time points. As MMP 9 protein expression was sensitive to treatment, MMP 9 mRNA levels were quantified in tissue which had been treated for 3 days (Figure 3C). MMP 9 mRNA was below the limit of detection in both untreated and B. frereana treated cartilage explants. However, B. frereana reduced IL-1α/OSM-induced MMP 9 transcription by almost 50%, although this did not quite reach significance (p = 0.079; 2-sample t-test). B. frereana reduces cytokine-induced nitrite production and supresses iNOS mRNA expression in an in vitro model of cartilage degradation. The amount of nitrite produced by the untreated explants, and explants treated with B. frereana was low (< 5µM/mg dry weight tissue) and did not change appreciably over the 28 day culture period (Figure 4A). As expected, cytokine treatment significantly increased production of nitrite after 3 (p < 0.0033), 7 (p = 0.0009), 14 (p < 0.0029), 21 (p < 0.0001) and 28 days (p < 0.0001) relative to untreated explants (log transformation of data), but B. frereana, significantly inhibited IL-1a/OSM induced nitrite production after 14 (p = 0.003), 21 (p = 0.0007) and 28 days (p = 0.001) (log transformation of data) iNOS mRNA expression levels were quantified to determine whether the reduction in nitrite at the later time points might be attributed to transcriptional inhibition early on in the culture period (Figure 4B). There were variable but minimal amounts of iNOS mRNA in untreated cartilage explants after 3 days in culture. iNOS mRNA was not detected in cartilage treated with B. frereana. As expected, there was an approximate 50-fold increase in iNOS mRNA levels in IL-1α/OSM-stimulated explants relative to the untreated controls (p < 0.0001; log transformation), which was reduced by approximately 75% in the presence of B. frereana (p = 0.02; log transformation), consistent with the levels of nitrite observed in the culture media. B. frereana reduces cytokine-induced PGE2 production and supresses both PGE2 synthase and COX-2 mRNA expression in an in vitro model of cartilage degradation. The amount of PGE2 produced by the untreated explants and explants treated with B. frereana did not change appreciably over the 28 day culture period (< 25pg/mg dry weight tissue) (Figure 5A). As expected, cytokine treatment significantly increased PGE2 production after 3 (p = 0.012; log transformation), 7 (p = 0.0002), 14 (p = 0.006; log transformation), 21 (p < 0.0001; log transformation) and 28 days (p < 0.0001; log transformation) relative to untreated explants, ranging from 100 - 1000pg/mg dry weight tissue. In the presence of B. frereana, there was a significant inhibition of IL-1α/OSM-induced PGE2 production in explants after 7 (p = 0.03), 21 (p = 0.005; log transformation) and 28 days of treatment (p = 0.0005; log transformation); however this did not return to basal levels. PGE2 synthase mRNA expression levels were also quantified to determine whether the reduction in PGE2 observed over the culture period might be attributed to inhibition of PGE2 synthase transcription (Figure 5B). PGE2 synthase mRNA was not detectable in either the untreated cartilage or in the tissue treated with B. frereana after 3 days of culture. IL-1a/OSM stimulated PGE2 synthase mRNA expression in the cartilage, and this was reduced by almost 60% when cytokine-stimulated explants were co-treated with B. frereana (p = 0.007; 2-sample t-test). In conjunction, mRNA levels of COX-2 - the rate-limiting enzyme in PGE2 synthesis was also quantified. Minimal amounts of COX-2 mRNA were observed in untreated cartilage, and levels were undetectable in cartilage treated with B. frereana (Figure 5B). There was a significant 12-fold increase in COX-2 mRNA levels in IL-1α/OSM-stimulated explants relative to untreated cartilage (p < 0.0001), which was reduced by approximately 75% when co-treated with B. frereana (p = 0.0001). Epi-lupeol is the major constituent of B. frereana. Approximately 81% of the components present in the ethanol extract of B. frereana were identified using GC-MS as indicated (Figure 6). The major component identified, and accounting for 59.3% of the B. frereana extract was epi-lupeol (Figure 6B). Other minor components identified in the ethanolic B. frereana extract were β-amyrin (6.35%), Lupeol acetate (3.10%), α-amyrin (2.38%), α-phellandrene dimer 3 (1.10%), α-phellandrene dimer 5 (0.24%), α-thujene (0.34%) and α-phellandrene (0.24%). B. frereana inhibits Acetylcholinesterase The extracts of B. frereana, after spraying with the enzyme, substrate and detection reagent were found to yield bright white spots on the TLC plates a yellow background. They were able to inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase at all the concentrations tested (101.6 - 3.17 mg/ml). The reference standard galanthamine hydrobromide (1mM), a known inhibitor of AChE, also gave a bright white spot on the baseline of the TLC plate. No white spots, corresponding to false positives, were observed for the control TLC plate. B. frereana kills cancer cells Concentrations of the B. frereana extract at 800µg/ml or greater resulted in a decrease in formazan absorbance, indicating a reduction in mitochondrial activity and a reduction in cell number. This decrease in cell number could have occurred if the active components of the Boswellia extract were to cause cell cycle arrest (cytostasis). Prolonged cell cycle arrest in a phase other than G0 is intolerable to the cell and will ultimately result in indirect cellular damage and cell death. The cytotoxic components of the B. frereana extract may, therefore, be behaving as an apoptotic inducer and an enhancer of cell death towards the MCF-7 human cancer cells. Discussion In the present study, we utilised an in vitro model of cartilage degeneration (29, 30) to determine whether the little known Boswellia species - B. frereana had any anti-inflammatory efficacy, and therefore could be exploited as an alternative therapy for treating a variety of inflammatory disorders. Cartilage explants were treated with 5ng/ml IL-1α and 10ng/ml OSM over a 28-day period, in the presence or absence of 100µg/ml B. frereana. There was no evidence of either IL-1/OSM or B. frereana -induced cytotoxicity over the 28 day culture period. In this in vitro model, neither the cytokines nor the B. frereana had any discernable effect on the amount of sGAG or collagen retained in the explants. However, there was a significant increase in the amount of both sGAG and collagen released from the explants after IL-1a/OSM stimulation for 3 and 21-28 days, respectively, which is in agreement with previous reports (41, 42). In the presence of IL-1a/OSM approximately 50% of the sGAG content was released into the media over the 28 day period therefore it is slightly surprising that the amount of sGAG in the tissue does not reflect this. We surmise that in the presence of the cytokines, the tissue is continually synthesising new sGAG to replace that which is lost (43). Detection of sGAG and collagen in the media mainly represents degradation and release of ECM components from the tissue. Interestingly, B. frereana was only able to rescue IL-1/OSM-mediated collagen degradation. Over the 28 day period, B. frereana had no effect on the amount of sGAG released into the media after cytokine stimulation; this would suggest that a different mechanism of action must exist between the collagen and sGAG to explain the differential inhibition observed. Key mediators of collagen breakdown include MMPs 9 and 13 (44). Increased levels of active MMP 9 have been observed in pathological articular cartilage (1, 3-6). To ascertain whether the observed increase in collagen release by IL-1a/OSM and subsequent modulation by B. frereana, represented a catabolic phenotype, the expression and activation status of pro-MMP 9 was analysed. Over the 28 days, both pro-MMP 9 synthesis and its activation increased substantially in cytokine-stimulated explants, which may have contributed to the significant release of collagen at days 21-28, as has been previously reported (44). B. frereana inhibited IL-1α/OSM-mediated synthesis and activation of pro-MMP 9 returning expression to basal levels. [IL-1α/OSM did not have a significant effect on pro-MMP 2 expression, although levels of active MMP 2 appeared to increase. After 28 days, B. frereana also inhibited activation of pro-MMP 2]. Our data suggests that the reduction in IL-1α/OSM-induced expression of pro-MMP 9 in explants treated with B. frereana may arise from the transcriptional inhibition of MMP 9 that we observed. MMP 9 synthesis is modulated by a variety of pro-inflammatory molecules including NO and COX-2 (45), and it is well established that both NO and COX-2 are involved in cartilage degradation (43, 46). Nitrite, the stable end product of NO, was significantly elevated in cartilage explants stimulated with IL-1a/OSM over the entire culture period, whilst in the presence of B. frereana, cytokine-induced NO production was significantly inhibited. We hypothesise that the vast increase in pro-MMP 9 synthesis and activation can, in part, be attributed to NO levels, and that the action of B. frereana in inhibiting NO production prevented the downstream synthesis and/or activation of MMP 9. Joint inflammation in OA also increases circulating levels of COX-2 - the rate-limiting enzyme in PGE2 synthesis, which causes an increased synthesis of PGE2. A previous study indicated a link between NO and COX-2 expression in a canine model of experimental OA (45). The combination of IL-1α with OSM significantly elevated PGE2 synthesis to approximately 80-fold that observed in the untreated cartilage explants, consistent with previous studies (37, 47). Using the IL-1a/OSM combination, B. frereana reduced PGE2 levels although this did not return to basal levels. To further understand the mechanism of B. frereana action in this in vitro inflammatory model of cartilage degradation, we quantified the amount of gene transcripts for iNOS, PGE2 synthase and COX-2 using qPCR. All were observed to increase significantly in the explants treated with IL-1α/OSM, and in the combined presence of B. frereana, levels of gene transcription were significantly reduced; however, they did not return to the basal levels observed in untreated explants. Our data would suggest that the inhibitory action of B. frereana on NO and PGE2 synthesis is controlled at the transcriptional level. Although several studies have been performed on B. serrata, and its pharmacologically active components have been identified as predominantly α- and β-boswellic acids (24), little is known about the bioactive ingredients of B. frereana excepting that it is reported to differ from the other species (48). Using gas chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry, we have identified the primary constituents of B. frereana, of which epi-lupeol accounts for almost 60% of the extract. Although B. frereana has the geneology of the Boswellia species, it is devoid of the active components such as boswellic acid, that are characteristic of the other family members, as has previously been alluded to (48). Epi-lupeol is a pentacyclic triterpene; it's isomer lupeol is a naturally occurring triterpene found in various fruits and vegetables including olives, strawberries and fig plants (49). Interestingly, and of potential importance in understanding the mechanisms of B. frereana action in our study, is the biochemical properties of lupeol. Lupeol has been shown to have wide-ranging pharamacological properties including anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activity in vitro and in vivo (50, 51). Oral administration of lupeol to a rat model of antigen-induced arthritis led to a 39% reduction in paw swelling, and a reduction in the amount of hydroxyproline and sGAGs in the urine indicating that lupeol could ameliorate the symptoms of inflammation (51). Lupeol administered topically to a murine model of inflammation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol ester suppressed ear edema, due to a significant reduction in PGE2 and a weaker inhibition of nitrite release (50). Our observations support this in vivo data although we saw greater efficacy against nitrite production with respect to PGE2 levels, however, this may reflect the fact that the active component of B. frereana is epi-lupeol and not lupeol. Topical administration of lupeol to a mouse skin tumourigenesis model significantly inhibited skin edema and hyperplasia in conjunction with decreased expression of COX-2 and NO synthase (52), agreeing with the efficacy of epi-lupeol in our in vitro study. The reduction in COX-2 and NO synthase was attributed to an inhibition of NF-κB activation. The nuclear transcription factor NF-κB is a key player in the development and progression of chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (53). The anti-inflammatory properties of B. serrata involve the regulation of NF-κB activation, as demonstrated in a recent study using a mouse model of atherosclerosis (54). However, although B. serrata is known to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase function (25), lupeol was shown to have no effect on lipoxygenase products (50), therefore lupeol is not likely to affect the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Additionally extract of B. frereana was able to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and kill a well known model of cancer i.e. the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. To conclude, this is the first report detailing the anti-inflammatory, anti-acetylcholinesterase and cytotoxic efficacy of B. frereana. Our novel data demonstrates that the treatment of IL-1a/OSM stimulated cartilage explants with B. frereana confers some protection against degeneration of the tissue by inhibiting the breakdown of the collagenous matrix, through the inhibition of MMP 9 expression and activation, and significant reduction in the expression of inflammatory mediators including NO, PGE2 and COX-2. It follows that B. frereana can therefore be exploited as a medicament to treat MMP 9 mediated disorders or conditions where there is a need for a significant reduction in the expression of inflammatory mediators including NO, PGE2 and COX-2. B. frereana, which is non-toxic and particularly efficacious for PGE2 regulation may offer an additional perspective for the therapeutic action of this naturally occurring compound. Moreover, B. frereana may confer some protection against neurological disorders characterised by increased acetylcholinesterase activity or where it is desirable to block this activity. Further, B. frereana has application in the destruction of cancer cells. References 1. Davidson RK, Waters JG, Kevorkian L, Darrah C, Cooper A, Donell ST, et al.
