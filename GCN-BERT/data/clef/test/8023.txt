The ever-increasing world population and the dwindling supply of arable land available for agriculture fuels research towards increasing the efficiency of agriculture. Conventional means for crop and horticultural improvements utilise selective breeding techniques to identify plants having desirable characteristics. However, such selective breeding techniques have several drawbacks, namely that these techniques are typically labour intensive and result in plants that often contain heterogeneous genetic components that may not always result in the desirable trait being passed on from parent plants. Advances in molecular biology have allowed mankind to modify the germplasm of animals and plants. Genetic engineering of plants entails the isolation and manipulation of genetic material (typically in the form of DNA or RNA) and the subsequent introduction of that genetic material into a plant. Such technology has the capacity to deliver crops or plants having various improved economic, agronomic or horticultural traits. A trait of particular economic interest is increased yield. Yield is normally defined as the measurable produce of economic value from a crop. This may be defined in terms of quantity and/or quality. Yield is directly dependent on several factors, for example, the number and size of the organs, plant architecture (for example, the number of branches), seed production, leaf senescence and more. Root development, nutrient uptake, stress tolerance and early vigour may also be important factors in determining yield. Optimizing the abovementioned factors may therefore contribute to increasing crop yield. Seed yield is a particularly important trait, since the seeds of many plants are important for human and animal nutrition. Crops such as corn, rice, wheat, canola and soybean account for over half the total human caloric intake, whether through direct consumption of the seeds themselves or through consumption of meat products raised on processed seeds. They are also a source of sugars, oils and many kinds of metabolites used in industrial processes. Seeds contain an embryo (the source of new shoots and roots) and an endosperm (the source of nutrients for embryo growth during germination and during early growth of seedlings). The development of a seed involves many genes, and requires the transfer of metabolites from the roots, leaves and stems into the growing seed. The endosperm, in particular, assimilates the metabolic precursors of carbohydrates, oils and proteins and synthesizes them into storage macromolecules to fill out the grain. Plant biomass is yield for forage crops like alfalfa, silage corn and hay. Many proxies for yield have been used in grain crops. Chief amongst these are estimates of plant size. Plant size can be measured in many ways depending on species and developmental stage, but include total plant dry weight, above-ground dry weight, above-ground fresh weight, leaf area, stem volume, plant height, rosette diameter, leaf length, root length, root mass, tiller number and leaf number. Many species maintain a conservative ratio between the size of different parts of the plant at a given developmental stage. These allometric relationships are used to extrapolate from one of these measures of size to another (e.g. Tittonell et al 2005 Agric Ecosys & Environ 105: 213). Plant size at an early developmental stage will typically correlate with plant size later in development. A larger plant with a greater leaf area can typically absorb more light and carbon dioxide than a smaller plant and therefore will likely gain a greater weight during the same period (Fasoula & Tollenaar 2005 Maydica 50:39). This is in addition to the potential continuation of the micro-environmental or genetic advantage that the plant had to achieve the larger size initially. There is a strong genetic component to plant size and growth rate (e.g. ter Steege et al 2005 Plant Physiology 139:1078), and so for a range of diverse genotypes plant size under one environmental condition is likely to correlate with size under another (Hittalmani et al 2003 Theoretical Applied Genetics 107:679). In this way a standard environment is used as a proxy for the diverse and dynamic environments encountered at different locations and times by crops in the field. Another important trait for many crops is early vigour. Improving early vigour is an important objective of modern rice breeding programs in both temperate and tropical rice cultivars. Long roots are important for proper soil anchorage in water-seeded rice. Where rice is sown directly into flooded fields, and where plants must emerge rapidly through water, longer shoots are associated with vigour. Where drill-seeding is practiced, longer mesocotyls and coleoptiles are important for good seedling emergence. The ability to engineer early vigour into plants would be of great importance in agriculture. For example, poor early vigour has been a limitation to the introduction of maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids based on Corn Belt germplasm in the European Atlantic. Harvest index, the ratio of seed yield to aboveground dry weight, is relatively stable under many environmental conditions and so a robust correlation between plant size and grain yield can often be obtained (e.g. Rebetzke et al 2002 Crop Science 42:739). These processes are intrinsically linked because the majority of grain biomass is dependent on current or stored photosynthetic productivity by the leaves and stem of the plant (Gardener et al 1985 Physiology of Crop Plants. Iowa State University Press, ρρ68-73). Therefore, selecting for plant size, even at early stages of development, has been used as an indicator for future potential yield (e.g. Tittonell et al 2005 Agric Ecosys & Environ 105: 213). When testing for the impact of genetic differences on stress tolerance, the ability to standardize soil properties, temperature, water and nutrient availability and light intensity is an intrinsic advantage of greenhouse or plant growth chamber environments compared to the field. However, artificial limitations on yield due to poor pollination due to the absence of wind or insects, or insufficient space for mature root or canopy growth, can restrict the use of these controlled environments for testing yield differences. Therefore, measurements of plant size in early development, under standardized conditions in a growth chamber or greenhouse, are standard practices to provide indication of potential genetic yield advantages. A further important trait is that of improved abiotic stress tolerance. Abiotic stress is a primary cause of crop loss worldwide, reducing average yields for most major crop plants by more than 50% (Wang et al., Planta (2003) 218: 1-14). Abiotic stresses may be caused by drought, salinity, extremes of temperature, chemical toxicity and oxidative stress. The ability to improve plant tolerance to abiotic stress would be of great economic advantage to farmers worldwide and would allow for the cultivation of crops during adverse conditions and in territories where cultivation of crops may not otherwise be possible. Crop yield may therefore be increased by optimising one of the above-mentioned factors. Depending on the end use, the modification of certain yield traits may be favoured over others. For example for applications such as forage or wood production, or bio-fuel resource, an increase in the vegetative parts of a plant may be desirable, and for applications such as flour, starch or oil production, an increase in seed parameters may be particularly desirable. Even amongst the seed parameters, some may be favoured over others, depending on the application. Various mechanisms may contribute to increasing seed yield, whether that is in the form of increased seed size or increased seed number. One approach to increasing yield (seed yield and/or biomass) in plants may be through modification of the inherent growth mechanisms of a plant, such as the cell cycle or various signalling pathways involved in plant growth or in defense mechanisms. Concerning BZR, depending on the end use, the modification of certain yield traits may be favoured over others. For example for applications such as forage or wood production, or bio-fuel resource, an increase in the vegetative parts of a plant may be desirable, and for applications such as flour, starch or oil production, an increase in seed parameters may be particularly desirable. Even amongst the seed parameters, some may be favoured over others, depending on the application. Various mechanisms may contribute to increasing seed yield, whether that is in the form of increased seed size or increased seed number or increase number of inflorescences. It has now been found that various plant yield-related may be improved in plants by modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a RHL1 (Root Hairless 1) in a plant. Furthermore, it has now been found that various seed yield-related traits may be increased in plants relative to control plants, by increasing expression in a plant of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a transglutaminase (TGase) polypeptide. The increased seed yield-related traits comprise one or more of: increased total seed yield per plant, increased number of filled seeds, and increased harvest index. Even furthermore, it has now been found that various growth characteristics may be improved in plants by modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a TRY-like (Tryptichon) in a plant. Yet furthermore, It has now been found that seed yield may be improved in plants by modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a BZR (BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT) polypeptide in a plant. Background 1. Root Hairless 1 (RHLT) An RHL1 polypeptide was first described in 1998 by Schneider at al. (Genes Dev. 12, 2013-2021) as a nuclear targeted protein required for root hair initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana. RHL1 polypeptides are ubiquitous to the viridiplantae kingdom. Sequence comparison of RHL1 originating from different organism reveals that RHL1 polypeptides share an overall sequence similarity around 30-80 % identity. RHL1 polypeptides comprise a number of putative nuclear localization signals as well as phosphorylation sites and a PEST sequence which is a putative proteasome-dependent proteins degradation motif. The presence of such motifs may reportedly confer some regulatory roles by modulating subcellular localization of topos and /or their interaction with other proteins. The C-terminus of RHL1 proteins has weak but significant sequence similarity to the C-terminal of mammalian Τορο ll-alpha protein (Sugimoto-Shirasu et al. 2005 PNAS 102, 18736-17741). Eukaryotic topo II proteins belong to the subclass of the type II topo (typellA) that is required to unwind replicating double-stranded DNA. Physical Interaction between an RHL1 polypeptide and a plant topo VI protein, At ΤΟΡ6Β, has been reported (Sugimoto-Shirasu et al. 2005). It has been suggested that RHL1 polypeptides function in a plant topo VI complex active during the mitotic cell cycle and endocycle of plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana plants, hyp7, carrying mutations in an RHL1 gene exhibit an extreme drawf phenotype and defects in endoreduplication (Sugimoto-Shirasu et al. 2005). 2. Transglutaminases (TGases) Transglutaminases (TGases, EC 2.3.2.13; protein-glutamine-gamma-glutamyltransferase) are a family of enzymes that have a range of calcium (Ca)-dependent catalytic activities, most of which concern the post-translational modification of proteins. They catalyze the covalent attachment to proteins and polypeptides of a series of substances containing primary amine groups, i.e., they promote the formation of amide linkages, generally in a Ca-dependent fashion, between the primary amine of an amine donor substrate and the y-carboxamide group of peptide-bound endo-glutamine residues in proteins or polypeptides that are the amine acceptors: protein glutamine + alkylamine = protein N5-alkylglutamine + ΝΗ3. Polyamines have been shown to serve as physiological substrates of TGases. Polyamines appear to play an essential role in growth and cell division process in animals, microorganisms, and plants. One of the roles of polyamines is their regulatory action by a TGase-mediated process of post-translational modification (addition of polyamine moieties) of enzymes and structural proteins. TGases enzymes are found intracellularly and extracellularly, and are widely distributed in bacteria, animals and plants. In plants, the TGase activity is found in chloroplasts. Rubisco and apoproteins of the antenna complex have been shown to be substrates of TGase activity, thereby suggesting a role of these enzymes in photosynthesis related processes, such as protection protection of photosystem antenna proteins (Villalobos et al. (2004) Gene 336: 93-104). Transgenic rice plants (Claparols etal. (2004) Transgenic Research 13: 195-199) expressing a gene encoding rat prostate calcium-dependent transglutaminase polypeptide under the control of maize constitutive promoter accumulated the recombinant enzyme in an inactive form. International patent application WO 2003/102128 describes a nucleic acid sequence encoding a corn TGase polypeptide, vectors, micro-organisms and plants comprising such nucleic acid sequences, and the use of polypeptides with such TGase activity in food manipulation, processing and transformation. Surprisingly, it has now been found that increasing expression in a plant of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide as defined herein, gives plants having increased seed yield-related traits relative to control plants. According to one embodiment, there is provided a method for increasing seed yield-related traits in plants relative to control plants, comprising increasing expression in a plant of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide as defined herein. The increased seed yield-related traits comprise one or more of: increased total seed yield per plant, increased number of filled seeds, and increased harvest index. 3. Tryptichon (TRY-like) The Arabidopsis gene Tryptichon encodes a protein that reportedly negatively regulates trychome development and positively regulates root hair development. Trichome patterning in Arabidopsis is a model for the generation of a spacing pattern from initially equivalent cells. Schellmann et al. (ΕΜΒΟ J. 21, 5036-5046, 2002) show that the Tryptichon gene that functions in lateral inhibition encodes a single-repeat MYB-related transcription factor that lacks a recognizable activation domain. It has high sequence similarity to the root hair patterning gene Caprice. Both genes are expressed in trichomes and act together during lateral inhibition. They further show that Tryptichon and Caprice act redundantly in the position-dependent cell fate determination in the root epidermis. Thus, the same lateral inhibition mechanism seems to be involved in both de novo patterning and position-dependent cell determination (Schellmann et al., 2002). 4. BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 (BZR11 The regulation of gene expression is key to the viability of any cell. Several hundreds of proteins are involved in the regulation of gene transcription. In particular transcription factors play a central role and act directly on gene promoters. Plant genomes devote approximately 7% of their coding sequence to transcription factors (TFs; Rushton et al. 2008 Plant Physiology 147:280-295 (2008). Plants encode a particular class of transcription factors, the BES or BZR proteins, which modulate gene response to fluctuations in plant steroid hormones such as brassinosteroids (BRs). BZR transcription factors (BZR TFs) are characterized by the presence of a conserved BZR1 repressor domain typically found at the N-terminus of the protein and involved in binding to the targeted gene promoter. Plant typically encode a small number of BZR TFs. For example the Arabidopsis genome contains only 6 genes encoding BZR TFs, while tobacco, a plant in which this family of TFs is expanded encodes 19 BZR TFs. All TFs comprised a conserved BZR1 repressor domain and are predicted to function in the modulation of BR signalling. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the cascade of events in BR signalling are triggered upon binding of BRs to the BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1(BRI1)/BKI1 receptor complex at the plasma membrane, causing the release of ΒΚ11. The subsequent dimerization of BRI1 and BRI1 ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1 (ΒΑΚ1) activates a downstream signal transductionpathway that leads to BRI1 EMS SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1) and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1). The phosphorylation of BES1 and BZR1 by the kinase BIN2 appears to control their signalling activity by acting on the subcelullar localization and stability of the protein. Dephosphorilated BZR1 accumulates in the nuclei which is the site at which the transcriptional function is performed (Wang et al., 2006 Cell Res. 16: 427-434). Mechanistically, transcription factors of the BZR1 family directly bind to the promoter of the targeted gene and may act to activate or repress expression. Methods for modulating the Brassinosteroid response pathway to modify a number of traits in plants have been disclosed (US6,921,848). The traits as defined in US6,921,848 comprised increased growth and cell elongation in various organs and tissues. However those effects did not result in an increase in the number of organs such as the number of seeds produced and/or in an increase in the seed yield of the plant.

Definitions Comprising In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word “comprise” or variations such as “comprises” or “comprising” is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention. Polypeptide(s)/Protein(s) The terms “polypeptide” and “protein” are used interchangeably herein and refer to amino acids in a polymeric form of any length, linked together by peptide bonds. Polynucleotide(s)/Nucleic acid(s)/Nucleic acid sequencefsVnucleotide sequence(s) The terms "polynucleotide(s)", "nucleic acid sequence(s)", "nucleotide sequence(s)", “nucleic acid(s)”, “nucleic acid molecule” are used interchangeably herein and refer to nucleotides, either ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides or a combination of both, in a polymeric unbranched form of any length. Control plant(s) The choice of suitable control plants is a routine part of an experimental setup and may include corresponding wild type plants or corresponding plants without the gene of interest. The control plant is typically of the same plant species or even of the same variety as the plant to be assessed. The control plant may also be a nullizygote of the plant to be assessed. Nullizygotes are individuals missing the transgene by segregation. A “control plant” as used herein refers not only to whole plants, but also to plant parts, including seeds and seed parts. Homologue(s) “Homologues” of a protein encompass peptides, oligopeptides, polypeptides, proteins and enzymes having amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions relative to the unmodified protein in question and having similar biological and functional activity as the unmodified protein from which they are derived. A deletion refers to removal of one or more amino acids from a protein. An insertion refers to one or more amino acid residues being introduced into a predetermined site in a protein. Insertions may comprise N-terminal and/or C-terminal fusions as well as intra-sequence insertions of single or multiple amino acids. Generally, insertions within the amino acid sequence will be smaller than Ν- or C-terminal fusions, of the order of about 1 to 10 residues. Examples of Ν- or C-terminal fusion proteins or peptides include the binding domain or activation domain of a transcriptional activator as used in the yeast two-hybrid system, phage coat proteins, (histidine)-6-tag, glutathione S-transferase-tag, protein A, maltose-binding protein, dihydrofolate reductase, Tag*100 epitope, c-myc epitope, FLAG®-epitope, lacZ, CMP (calmodulin-binding peptide), HA epitope, protein C epitope and VSV epitope. A substitution refers to replacement of amino acids of the protein with other amino acids having similar properties (such as similar hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, antigenicity, propensity to form or break a-helical structures or 3-sheet structures). Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues, but may be clustered depending upon functional constraints placed upon the polypeptide; insertions will usually be of the order of about 1 to 10 amino acid residues. The amino acid substitutions are preferably conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative substitution tables are well known in the art (see for example Creighton (1984) Proteins. W.H. Freeman and Company (Eds) and Table 1 below). Table 1: Examples of conserved amino acid substitutions Residue Conservative Substitutions Residue Conservative Substitutions Ala Ser Leu lie; Val Arg Lys Lys Arg; Gin Asn Gin; His Met Leu; lie Asp Glu Phe Met; Leu; Tyr Gin Asn Ser Thr; Gly Cys Ser Thr Ser; Val Glu Asp Trp Tyr Gly Pro Tyr Trp; Phe His Asn; Gin Val lie; Leu lie Leu, Val Amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions may readily be made using peptide synthetic techniques well known in the art, such as solid phase peptide synthesis and the like, or by recombinant DNA manipulation. Methods for the manipulation of DNA sequences to produce substitution, insertion or deletion variants of a protein are well known in the art. For example, techniques for making substitution mutations at predetermined sites in DNA are well known to those skilled in the art and include Μ13 mutagenesis, T7-Gen in vitro mutagenesis (USB, Cleveland, OH), QuickChange Site Directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, San Diego, CA), PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis or other site-directed mutagenesis protocols. Derivatives “Derivatives” include peptides, oligopeptides, polypeptides which may, compared to the amino acid sequence of the naturally-occurring form of the protein, such as the protein of interest, comprise substitutions of amino acids with non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, or additions of non-naturally occurring amino acid residues. “Derivatives” of a protein also encompass peptides, oligopeptides, polypeptides which comprise naturally occurring altered (glycosylated, acylated, prenylated, phosphorylated, myristoylated, sulphated etc.) or non-naturally altered amino acid residues compared to the amino acid sequence of a naturally-occurring form of the polypeptide. A derivative may also comprise one or more non-amino acid substituents or additions compared to the amino acid sequence from which it is derived, for example a reporter molecule or other ligand, covalently or non-covalently bound to the amino acid sequence, such as a reporter molecule which is bound to facilitate its detection, and non-naturally occurring amino acid residues relative to the amino acid sequence of a naturally-occurring protein. Furthermore, “derivatives” also include fusions of the naturally-occurring form of the protein with tagging peptides such as FLAG, HIS6 or thioredoxin (for a review of tagging peptides, see Terpe, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 60, 523-533, 2003). Ortholoque(s)/Paraloque(s) Orthologues and paralogues encompass evolutionary concepts used to describe the ancestral relationships of genes. Paralogues are genes within the same species that have originated through duplication of an ancestral gene; orthologues are genes from different organisms that have originated through speciation, and are also derived from a common ancestral gene. Domain The term "domain" refers to a set of amino acids conserved at specific positions along an alignment of sequences of evolutionarily related proteins. While amino acids at other positions can vary between homologues, amino acids that are highly conserved at specific positions indicate amino acids that are likely essential in the structure, stability or function of a protein. Identified by their high degree of conservation in aligned sequences of a family of protein homologues, they can be used as identifiers to determine if any polypeptide in question belongs to a previously identified polypeptide family. Motif/Consensus sequence/Siqnature The term “motif” or “consensus sequence” or “signature” refers to a short conserved region in the sequence of evolutionarily related proteins. Motifs are frequently highly conserved parts of domains, but may also include only part of the domain, or be located outside of conserved domain (if all of the amino acids of the motif fall outside of a defined domain). Hybridisation The term "hybridisation" as defined herein is a process wherein substantially homologous complementary nucleotide sequences anneal to each other. The hybridisation process can occur entirely in solution, i.e. both complementary nucleic acids are in solution. The hybridisation process can also occur with one of the complementary nucleic acids immobilised to a matrix such as magnetic beads, Sepharose beads or any other resin. The hybridisation process can furthermore occur with one of the complementary nucleic acids immobilised to a solid support such as a nitro-cellulose or nylon membrane or immobilised by e.g. photolithography to, for example, a siliceous glass support (the latter known as nucleic acid arrays or microarrays or as nucleic acid chips). In order to allow hybridisation to occur, the nucleic acid molecules are generally thermally or chemically denatured to melt a double strand into two single strands and/or to remove hairpins or other secondary structures from single stranded nucleic acids. The term “stringency” refers to the conditions under which a hybridisation takes place. The stringency of hybridisation is influenced by conditions such as temperature, salt concentration, ionic strength and hybridisation buffer composition. Generally, low stringency conditions are selected to be about 30°C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. Medium stringency conditions are when the temperature is 20°C below Tm, and high stringency conditions are when the temperature is 10°C below Tm. High stringency hybridisation conditions are typically used for isolating hybridising sequences that have high sequence similarity to the target nucleic acid sequence. However, nucleic acids may deviate in sequence and still encode a substantially identical polypeptide, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Therefore medium stringency hybridisation conditions may sometimes be needed to identify such nucleic acid molecules. The Tm is the temperature under defined ionic strength and pH, at which 50% of the target sequence hybridises to a perfectly matched probe. The Tm is dependent upon the solution conditions and the base composition and length of the probe. For example, longer sequences hybridise specifically at higher temperatures. The maximum rate of hybridisation is obtained from about 16°C up to 32°C below Tm. The presence of monovalent cations in the hybridisation solution reduce the electrostatic repulsion between the two nucleic acid strands thereby promoting hybrid formation; this effect is visible for sodium concentrations of up to 0.4Μ (for higher concentrations, this effect may be ignored). Formamide reduces the melting temperature of DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA duplexes with 0.6 to 0.7°C for each percent formamide, and addition of 50% formamide allows hybridisation to be performed at 30 to 45°C, though the rate of hybridisation will be lowered. Base pair mismatches reduce the hybridisation rate and the thermal stability of the duplexes. On average and for large probes, the Tm decreases about 1°C per % base mismatch. The Tm may be calculated using the following equations, depending on the types of hybrids: 1) DNA-DNA hybrids (Meinkoth and Wahl, Anal. Biochem., 138: 267-284, 1984): Tm= 81.5°C + 16.6xlog«>[NaT + 0.41x%[G/Cb] - 500x[Lc]'1 - 0.61χ% formamide 2) DNA-RNA or RNA-RNA hybrids: Tm= 79.8 + 18.5 (logi0[Na+]a) + 0.58 (%G/Cb) + 11.8 (%G/Cb)2 - 820/Lc 3) oligo-DNA or oligo-RNAd hybrids: For <20 nucleotides: Tm= 2 (ln) For 20-35 nucleotides: Tm= 22 + 1.46 (ln) a or for other monovalent cation, but only accurate in the 0.01-0.4 Μ range. b only accurate for %GC in the 30% to 75% range. c L = length of duplex in base pairs. d oligo, oligonucleotide; ln, = effective length of primer = 2χ(ηο. of G/C)+(no. of Α/Τ). Non-specific binding may be controlled using any one of a number of known techniques such as, for example, blocking the membrane with protein containing solutions, additions of heterologous RNA, DNA, and SDS to the hybridisation buffer, and treatment with Rnase. For non-homologous probes, a series of hybridizations may be performed by varying one of (i) progressively lowering the annealing temperature (for example from 68°C to 42°C) or (ii) progressively lowering the formamide concentration (for example from 50% to 0%). The skilled artisan is aware of various parameters which may be altered during hybridisation and which will either maintain or change the stringency conditions. Besides the hybridisation conditions, specificity of hybridisation typically also depends on the function of post-hybridisation washes. To remove background resulting from non-specific hybridisation, samples are washed with dilute salt solutions. Critical factors of such washes include the ionic strength and temperature of the final wash solution: the lower the salt concentration and the higher the wash temperature, the higher the stringency of the wash. Wash conditions are typically performed at or below hybridisation stringency. A positive hybridisation gives a signal that is at least twice of that of the background. Generally, suitable stringent conditions for nucleic acid hybridisation assays or gene amplification detection procedures are as set forth above. More or less stringent conditions may also be selected. The skilled artisan is aware of various parameters which may be altered during washing and which will either maintain or change the stringency conditions. For example, typical high stringency hybridisation conditions for DNA hybrids longer than 50 nucleotides encompass hybridisation at 65°C in 1χ SSC or at 42°C in 1χ SSC and 50% formamide, followed by washing at 65°C in 0.3χ SSC. Examples of medium stringency hybridisation conditions for DNA hybrids longer than 50 nucleotides encompass hybridisation at 50°C in 4χ SSC or at 40°C in 6χ SSC and 50% formamide, followed by washing at 50°C in 2χ SSC. The length of the hybrid is the anticipated length for the hybridising nucleic acid. When nucleic acids of known sequence are hybridised, the hybrid length may be determined by aligning the sequences and identifying the conserved regions described herein. 1xSSC is 0.15Μ NaCI and 15mM sodium citrate; the hybridisation solution and wash solutions may additionally include 5χ Denhardt's reagent, 0.5-1.0% SDS, 100 pg/ml denatured, fragmented salmon sperm DNA, 0.5% sodium pyrophosphate. For the purposes of defining the level of stringency, reference can be made to Sambrook et al. (2001) Molecular Cloning: a laboratory manual, 3rd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, CSH, New York or to Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Ν.Υ. (1989 and yearly updates). Splice variant The term “splice variant” as used herein encompasses variants of a nucleic acid sequence in which selected introns and/or exons have been excised, replaced, displaced or added, or in which introns have been shortened or lengthened. Such variants will be ones in which the biological activity of the protein is substantially retained; this may be achieved by selectively retaining functional segments of the protein. Such splice variants may be found in nature or may be manmade. Methods for predicting and isolating such splice variants are well known in the art (see for example Foissac and Schiex (2005) BMC Bioinformatics 6: 25). Allelic variant Alleles or allelic variants are alternative forms of a given gene, located at the same chromosomal position. Allelic variants encompass Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as Small Insertion/Deletion Polymorphisms (INDELs). The size of INDELs is usually less than 100 bp. SNPs and INDELs form the largest set of sequence variants in naturally occurring polymorphic strains of most organisms. Gene shufflinq/Directed evolution Gene shuffling or directed evolution consists of iterations of DNA shuffling followed by appropriate screening and/or selection to generate variants of nucleic acids or portions thereof encoding proteins having a modified biological activity (Castle et al., (2004) Science 304(5674): 1151-4; US patents 5,811,238 and 6,395,547). Regulatory element/Control sequence/Promoter The terms “regulatory element”, “control sequence” and “promoter” are all used interchangeably herein and are to be taken in a broad context to refer to regulatory nucleic acid sequences capable of effecting expression of the sequences to which they are ligated. The term “promoter” typically refers to a nucleic acid control sequence located upstream from the transcriptional start of a gene and which is involved in recognising and binding of RNA polymerase and other proteins, thereby directing transcription of an operably linked nucleic acid. Encompassed by the aforementioned terms are transcriptional regulatory sequences derived from a classical eukaryotic genomic gene (including the TATA box which is required for accurate transcription initiation, with or without a CCAAT box sequence) and additional regulatory elements (i.e. upstream activating sequences, enhancers and silencers) which alter gene expression in response to developmental and/or external stimuli, or in a tissue-specific manner. Also included within the term is a transcriptional regulatory sequence of a classical prokaryotic gene, in which case it may include a -35 box sequence and/or -10 box transcriptional regulatory sequences. The term “regulatory element” also encompasses a synthetic fusion molecule or derivative that confers, activates or enhances expression of a nucleic acid molecule in a cell, tissue or organ. A “plant promoter” comprises regulatory elements, which mediate the expression of a coding sequence segment in plant cells. Accordingly, a plant promoter need not be of plant origin, but may originate from viruses or micro-organisms, for example from viruses which attack plant cells. The “plant promoter” can also originate from a plant cell, e.g. from the plant which is transformed with the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed in the inventive process and described herein. This also applies to other “plant” regulatory signals, such as “plant” terminators. The promoters upstream of the nucleotide sequences useful in the methods of the present invention can be modified by one or more nucleotide substitution(s), insertion(s) and/or deletion(s) without interfering with the functionality or activity of either the promoters, the open reading frame (ORF) or the 3'-regulatory region such as terminators or other 3' regulatory regions which are located away from the ORF. It is furthermore possible that the activity of the promoters is increased by modification of their sequence, or that they are replaced completely by more active promoters, even promoters from heterologous organisms. For expression in plants, the nucleic acid molecule must, as described above, be linked operably to or comprise a suitable promoter which expresses the gene at the right point in time and with the required spatial expression pattern. For the identification of functionally equivalent promoters, the promoter strength and/or expression pattern of a candidate promoter may be analysed for example by operably linking the promoter to a reporter gene and assaying the expression level and pattern of the reporter gene in various tissues of the plant. Suitable well-known reporter genes include for example beta-glucuronidase or beta-galactosidase. The promoter activity is assayed by measuring the enzymatic activity of the beta-glucuronidase or beta-galactosidase. The promoter strength and/or expression pattern may then be compared to that of a reference promoter (such as the one used in the methods of the present invention). Alternatively, promoter strength may be assayed by quantifying mRNA levels or by comparing mRNA levels of the nucleic acid used in the methods of the present invention, with mRNA levels of housekeeping genes such as 18S rRNA, using methods known in the art, such as Northern blotting with densitometric analysis of autoradiograms, quantitative real-time PCR or RT-PCR (Heid et al., 1996 Genome Methods 6: 986-994). Generally by “weak promoter” is intended a promoter that drives expression of a coding sequence at a low level. By “low level” is intended at levels of about 1/10,000 transcripts to about 1/100,000 transcripts, to about 1/500,0000 transcripts per cell. Conversely, a “strong promoter” drives expression of a coding sequence at high level, or at about 1/10 transcripts to about 1/100 transcripts to about 1/1000 transcripts per cell. Generally, by “medium strength promoter” is intended a promoter that drives expression of a coding sequence at a lower level than a strong promoter, in particular at a level that is in all instances below that obtained when under the control of a 35S CaMV promoter. Operably linked The term “operably linked” as used herein refers to a functional linkage between the promoter sequence and the gene of interest, such that the promoter sequence is able to initiate transcription of the gene of interest. Constitutive promoter A “constitutive promoter” refers to a promoter that is transcriptionally active during most, but not necessarily all, phases of growth and development and under most environmental conditions, in at least one cell, tissue or organ. Table 2a below gives examples of constitutive promoters.

Developmentallv-requlated promoter A developmentally-regulated promoter is active during certain developmental stages or in parts of the plant that undergo developmental changes. Inducible promoter An inducible promoter has induced or increased transcription initiation in response to a chemical (for a review see Gatz 1997, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol., 48:89-108), environmental or physical stimulus, or may be “stress-inducible”, i.e. activated when a plant is exposed to various stress conditions, or a “pathogen-inducible" i.e. activated when a plant is exposed to exposure to various pathogens. Orqan-specific/Tissue-specific promoter An organ-specific or tissue-specific promoter is one that is capable of preferentially initiating transcription in certain organs or tissues, such as the leaves, roots, seed tissue etc. For example, a “root-specific promoter” is a promoter that is transcriptionally active predominantly in plant roots, substantially to the exclusion of any other parts of a plant, whilst still allowing for any leaky expression in these other plant parts. Promoters able to initiate transcription in certain cells only are referred to herein as “cell-specific”. Examples of root-specific promoters are listed in Table 2b below: Table 2b: Examples of root-specific promoters Gene Source Reference RCc3 Plant Mol Biol. 1995 Jan;27(2):237-48 Arabidopsis ΡΗΤ1 Kovama et al., 2005; Mudge et al.

The seed-specific promoter may be active during seed development and/or during germination. The seed specific promoter may be endosperm/aieurone/embryo specific. Examples of seed-specific promoters (endosperm/aieurone/embryo specific) are shown in Table 2c to Table 2f below.

The terminator can be derived from the natural gene, from a variety of other plant genes, or from T-DNA. The terminator to be added may be derived from, for example, the nopaline synthase or octopine synthase genes, or alternatively from another plant gene, or less preferably from any other eukaryotic gene. Modulation The term “modulation” means in relation to expression or gene expression, a process in which the expression level is changed by said gene expression in comparison to the control plant, the expression level may be increased or decreased. The original, unmodulated expression may be of any kind of expression of a structural RNA (rRNA, tRNA) or mRNA with subsequent translation. The term “modulating the activity” shall mean any change of the expression of the inventive nucleic acid sequences or encoded proteins, which leads to increased yield and/or increased growth of the plants. Expression The term “expression” or “gene expression” means the transcription of a specific gene or specific genes or specific genetic construct. The term “expression” or “gene expression” in particular means the transcription of a gene or genes or genetic construct into structural RNA (rRNA, tRNA) or mRNA with or without subsequent translation of the latter into a protein. The process includes transcription of DNA and processing of the resulting mRNA product. I ncreased expression/overexpression The term “increased expression” or “overexpression” as used herein means any form of expression that is additional to the original wild-type expression level. Methods for increasing expression of genes or gene products are well documented in the art and include, for example, overexpression driven by appropriate promoters, the use of transcription enhancers or translation enhancers. Isolated nucleic acids which serve as promoter or enhancer elements may be introduced in an appropriate position (typically upstream) of a non-heterologous form of a polynucleotide so as to upregulate expression of a nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide of interest. For example, endogenous promoters may be altered in vivo by mutation, deletion, and/or substitution (see, Kmiec, US 5,565,350; Zarling et al., W09322443), or isolated promoters may be introduced into a plant cell in the proper orientation and distance from a gene of the present invention so as to control the expression of the gene. If polypeptide expression is desired, it is generally desirable to include a polyadenylation region at the 3'-end of a polynucleotide coding region. The polyadenylation region can be derived from the natural gene, from a variety of other plant genes, or from T-DNA. The 3' end sequence to be added may be derived from, for example, the nopaline synthase or octopine synthase genes, or alternatively from another plant gene, or less preferably from any other eukaryotic gene. An intron sequence may also be added to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) or the coding sequence of the partial coding sequence to increase the amount of the mature message that accumulates in the cytosol. Inclusion of a spliceable intron in the transcription unit in both plant and animal expression constructs has been shown to increase gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels up to 1000-fold (Buchman and Berg (1988) Mol. Cell biol. 8: 4395-4405; Callis et al. (1987) Genes Dev 1:1183-1200). Such intron enhancement of gene expression is typically greatest when placed near the 5' end of the transcription unit. Use of the maize introns Adh1-S intron 1, 2, and 6, the Bronze-1 intron are known in the art. For general information see: The Maize Handbook, Chapter 116, Freeling and Walbot, Eds., Springer, Ν.Υ. (1994). Endogenous gene Reference herein to an “endogenous” gene not only refers to the gene in question as found in a plant in its natural form (i.e., without there being any human intervention), but also refers to that same gene (or a substantially homologous nucleic acid/gene) in an isolated form subsequently (re)introduced into a plant (a transgene). For example, a transgenic plant containing such a transgene may encounter a substantial reduction of the transgene expression and/or substantial reduction of expression of the endogenous gene. The isolated gene may be isolated from an organism or may be manmade, for example by chemical synthesis. Decreased expression Reference herein to “decreased expression” or “reduction or substantial elimination” of expression is taken to mean a decrease in endogenous gene expression and/or polypeptide levels and/or polypeptide activity relative to control plants. The reduction or substantial elimination is in increasing order of preference at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more reduced compared to that of control plants. Methods for decreasing expression are known in the art and the skilled person would readily be able to adapt the known methods for silencing so as to achieve reduction of expression of an endogenous gene in a whole plant or in parts thereof through the use of an appropriate promoter, for example. For the reduction or substantial elimination of expression an endogenous gene in a plant, a sufficient length of substantially contiguous nucleotides of a nucleic acid sequence is required. In order to perform gene silencing, this may be as little as 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10 or fewer nucleotides, alternatively this may be as much as the entire gene (including the 5’ and/or 3’ UTR, either in part or in whole). The stretch of substantially contiguous nucleotides may be derived from the nucleic acid encoding the protein of interest (target gene), or from any nucleic acid capable of encoding an orthologue, paralogue or homologue of the protein of interest. Preferably, the stretch of substantially contiguous nucleotides is capable of forming hydrogen bonds with the target gene (either sense or antisense strand), more preferably, the stretch of substantially contiguous nucleotides has, in increasing order of preference, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 100% sequence identity to the target gene (either sense or antisense strand). A nucleic acid sequence encoding a (functional) polypeptide is not a requirement for the various methods discussed herein for the reduction or substantial elimination of expression of an endogenous gene. Examples of various methods for the reduction or substantial elimination of expression in a plant of an endogenous gene, or for lowering levels and/or activity of a protein, are known to the skilled in the art. A skilled person would readily be able to adapt the known methods for silencing, so as to achieve reduction of expression of an endogenous gene in a whole plant or in parts thereof through the use of an appropriate promoter, for example. This reduction or substantial elimination of expression may be achieved using routine tools and techniques. A preferred method for the reduction or substantial elimination of endogenous gene expression is by introducing and expressing in a plant a genetic construct into which the nucleic acid (in this case a stretch of substantially contiguous nucleotides derived from the gene of interest, or from any nucleic acid capable of encoding an orthologue, paralogue or homologue of any one of the protein of interest) is cloned as an inverted repeat (in part or completely), separated by a spacer (non-coding DNA). In such a preferred method, expression of the endogenous gene is reduced or substantially eliminated through RNA-mediated silencing using an inverted repeat of a nucleic acid or a part thereof (in this case a stretch of substantially contiguous nucleotides derived from the gene of interest, or from any nucleic acid capable of encoding an orthologue, paralogue or homologue of the protein of interest), preferably capable of forming a hairpin structure. The inverted repeat is cloned in an expression vector comprising control sequences. A non-coding DNA nucleic acid sequence (a spacer, for example a matrix attachment region fragment (MAR), an intron, a polylinker, etc.) is located between the two inverted nucleic acids forming the inverted repeat. After transcription of the inverted repeat, a chimeric RNA with a self-complementary structure is formed (partial or complete). This double-stranded RNA structure is referred to as the hairpin RNA (hpRNA). The hpRNA is processed by the plant into siRNAs that are incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC further cleaves the mRNA transcripts, thereby substantially reducing the number of mRNA transcripts to be translated into polypeptides. For further general details see for example, Grierson et al. (1998) WO 98/53083; Waterhouse et al. (1999) WO 99/53050). Performance of the methods of the invention does not rely on introducing and expressing in a plant a genetic construct into which the nucleic acid is cloned as an inverted repeat, but any one or more of several well-known “gene silencing” methods may be used to achieve the same effects. One such method for the reduction of endogenous gene expression is RNA-mediated silencing of gene expression (downregulation). Silencing in this case is triggered in a plant by a double stranded RNA sequence (dsRNA) that is substantially similar to the target endogenous gene. This dsRNA is further processed by the plant into about 20 to about 26 nucleotides called short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The siRNAs are incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that cleaves the mRNA transcript of the endogenous target gene, thereby substantially reducing the number of mRNA transcripts to be translated into a polypeptide. Preferably, the double stranded RNA sequence corresponds to a target gene. Another example of an RNA silencing method involves the introduction of nucleic acid sequences or parts thereof (in this case a stretch of substantially contiguous nucleotides derived from the gene of interest, or from any nucleic acid capable of encoding an orthologue, paralogue or homologue of the protein of interest) in a sense orientation into a plant. “Sense orientation” refers to a DNA sequence that is homologous to an mRNA transcript thereof. Introduced into a plant would therefore be at least one copy of the nucleic acid sequence. The additional nucleic acid sequence will reduce expression of the endogenous gene, giving rise to a phenomenon known as co-suppression. The reduction of gene expression will be more pronounced if several additional copies of a nucleic acid sequence are introduced into the plant, as there is a positive correlation between high transcript levels and the triggering of co-suppression. Another example of an RNA silencing method involves the use of antisense nucleic acid sequences. An "antisense" nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a "sense" nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein, i.e. complementary to the coding strand of a double-stranded cDNA molecule or complementary to an mRNA transcript sequence. The antisense nucleic acid sequence is preferably complementary to the endogenous gene to be silenced. The complementarity may be located in the “coding region” and/or in the “non-coding region” of a gene. The term “coding region" refers to a region of the nucleotide sequence comprising codons that are translated into amino acid residues. The term “non-coding region" refers to 5' and 3' sequences that flank the coding region that are transcribed but not translated into amino acids (also referred to as 5' and 3' untranslated regions). Antisense nucleic acid sequences can be designed according to the rules of Watson and Crick base pairing. The antisense nucleic acid sequence may be complementary to the entire nucleic acid sequence (in this case a stretch of substantially contiguous nucleotides derived from the gene of interest, or from any nucleic acid capable of encoding an orthologue, paralogue or homologue of the protein of interest), but may also be an oligonucleotide that is antisense to only a part of the nucleic acid sequence (including the mRNA 5’ and 3’ UTR). For example, the antisense oligonucleotide sequence may be complementary to the region surrounding the translation start site of an mRNA transcript encoding a polypeptide. The length of a suitable antisense oligonucleotide sequence is known in the art and may start from about 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15 or 10 nucleotides in length or less. An antisense nucleic acid sequence according to the invention may be constructed using chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions using methods known in the art. For example, an antisense nucleic acid sequence (e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide sequence) may be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between the antisense and sense nucleic acid sequences, e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides may be used. Examples of modified nucleotides that may be used to generate the antisense nucleic acid sequences are well known in the art. Known nucleotide modifications include methylation, cyclization and 'caps' and substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analogue such as inosine. Other modifications of nucleotides are well known in the art. The antisense nucleic acid sequence can be produced biologically using an expression vector into which a nucleic acid sequence has been subcloned in an antisense orientation (i.e., RNA transcribed from the inserted nucleic acid will be of an antisense orientation to a target nucleic acid of interest). Preferably, production of antisense nucleic acid sequences in plants occurs by means of a stably integrated nucleic acid construct comprising a promoter, an operably linked antisense oligonucleotide, and a terminator. The nucleic acid molecules used for silencing in the methods of the invention (whether introduced into a plant or generated in situ) hybridize with or bind to mRNA transcripts and/or genomic DNA encoding a polypeptide to thereby inhibit expression of the protein, e.g., by inhibiting transcription and/or translation. The hybridization can be by conventional nucleotide complementarity to form a stable duplex, or, for example, in the case of an antisense nucleic acid sequence which binds to DNA duplexes, through specific interactions in the major groove of the double helix. Antisense nucleic acid sequences may be introduced into a plant by transformation or direct injection at a specific tissue site. Alternatively, antisense nucleic acid sequences can be modified to target selected cells and then administered systemically. For example, for systemic administration, antisense nucleic acid sequences can be modified such that they specifically bind to receptors or antigens expressed on a selected cell surface, e.g., by linking the antisense nucleic acid sequence to peptides or antibodies which bind to cell surface receptors or antigens. The antisense nucleic acid sequences can also be delivered to cells using the vectors described herein. According to a further aspect, the antisense nucleic acid sequence is an a-anomeric nucleic acid sequence. An a-anomeric nucleic acid sequence forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual b-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gaultier et al. (1987) Nucl Ac Res 15: 6625-6641). The antisense nucleic acid sequence may also comprise a 2'-o-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al. (1987) Nucl Ac Res 15, 6131-6148) or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue et al. (1987) FEBS Lett. 215, 327-330). The reduction or substantial elimination of endogenous gene expression may also be performed using ribozymes. Ribozymes are catalytic RNA molecules with ribonuclease activity that are capable of cleaving a single-stranded nucleic acid sequence, such as an mRNA, to which they have a complementary region. Thus, ribozymes (e.g., hammerhead ribozymes (described in Haselhoff and Gerlach (1988) Nature 334, 585-591) can be used to catalytically cleave mRNA transcripts encoding a polypeptide, thereby substantially reducing the number of mRNA transcripts to be translated into a polypeptide. A ribozyme having specificity for a nucleic acid sequence can be designed (see for example: Cech et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,987,071; and Cech et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,116,742). Alternatively, mRNA transcripts corresponding to a nucleic acid sequence can be used to select a catalytic RNA having a specific ribonuclease activity from a pool of RNA molecules (Bartel and Szostak (1993) Science 261, 1411-1418). The use of ribozymes for gene silencing in plants is known in the art (e.g., Atkins et al. (1994) WO 94/00012; Lenne et al. (1995) WO 95/03404; Lutziger et al. (2000) WO 00/00619; Prinsen et al. (1997) WO 97/13865 and Scott et al. (1997) WO 97/38116). Gene silencing may also be achieved by insertion mutagenesis (for example, T-DNA insertion or transposon insertion) or by strategies as described by, among others, Angell and Baulcombe ((1999) Plant J 20(3): 357-62), (Amplicon VIGS WO 98/36083), or Baulcombe (WO 99/15682). Gene silencing may also occur if there is a mutation on an endogenous gene and/or a mutation on an isolated gene/nucleic acid subsequently introduced into a plant. The reduction or substantial elimination may be caused by a non-functional polypeptide. For example, the polypeptide may bind to various interacting proteins; one or more mutation(s) and/or truncation(s) may therefore provide for a polypeptide that is still able to bind interacting proteins (such as receptor proteins) but that cannot exhibit its normal function (such as signalling ligand). A further approach to gene silencing is by targeting nucleic acid sequences complementary to the regulatory region of the gene (e.g., the promoter and/or enhancers) to form triple helical structures that prevent transcription of the gene in target cells. See Helene, C., Anticancer Drug Res. 6, 569-84, 1991; Helene et al., Ann. Ν.Υ. Acad. Sci. 660, 27-36 1992; and Maher, L.J. Bioassays 14, 807-15, 1992. Other methods, such as the use of antibodies directed to an endogenous polypeptide for inhibiting its function in planta, or interference in the signalling pathway in which a polypeptide is involved, will be well known to the skilled man. In particular, it can be envisaged that manmade molecules may be useful for inhibiting the biological function of a target polypeptide, or for interfering with the signalling pathway in which the target polypeptide is involved. Alternatively, a screening program may be set up to identify in a plant population natural variants of a gene, which variants encode polypeptides with reduced activity. Such natural variants may also be used for example, to perform homologous recombination. Artificial and/or natural microRNAs (miRNAs) may be used to knock out gene expression and/or mRNA translation. Endogenous miRNAs are single stranded small RNAs of typically 19-24 nucleotides long. They function primarily to regulate gene expression and/ or mRNA translation. Most plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have perfect or near-perfect complementarity with their target sequences. However, there are natural targets with up to five mismatches. They are processed from longer non-coding RNAs with characteristic fold-back structures by double-strand specific RNases of the Dicer family. Upon processing, they are incorporated in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by binding to its main component, an Argonaute protein. MiRNAs serve as the specificity components of RISC, since they base-pair to target nucleic acids, mostly mRNAs, in the cytoplasm. Subsequent regulatory events include target mRNA cleavage and destruction and/or translational inhibition. Effects of miRNA overexpression are thus often reflected in decreased mRNA levels of target genes. Artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs), which are typically 21 nucleotides in length, can be genetically engineered specifically to negatively regulate gene expression of single or multiple genes of interest. Determinants of plant microRNA target selection are well known in the art. Empirical parameters for target recognition have been defined and can be used to aid in the design of specific amiRNAs, (Schwab et al., Dev. Cell 8, 517-527, 2005). Convenient tools for design and generation of amiRNAs and their precursors are also available to the public (Schwab et al., Plant Cell 18, 1121-1133, 2006). For optimal performance, the gene silencing techniques used for reducing expression in a plant of an endogenous gene requires the use of nucleic acid sequences from monocotyledonous plants for transformation of monocotyledonous plants, and from dicotyledonous plants for transformation of dicotyledonous plants. Preferably, a nucleic acid sequence from any given plant species is introduced into that same species. For example, a nucleic acid sequence from rice is transformed into a rice plant. However, it is not an absolute requirement that the nucleic acid sequence to be introduced originates from the same plant species as the plant in which it will be introduced. It is sufficient that there is substantial homology between the endogenous target gene and the nucleic acid to be introduced. Described above are examples of various methods for the reduction or substantial elimination of expression in a plant of an endogenous gene. A person skilled in the art would readily be able to adapt the aforementioned methods for silencing so as to achieve reduction of expression of an endogenous gene in a whole plant or in parts thereof through the use of an appropriate promoter, for example. Selectable marker (qeneVReporter gene "Selectable marker", "selectable marker gene" or “reporter gene” includes any gene that confers a phenotype on a cell in which it is expressed to facilitate the identification and/or selection of cells that are transfected or transformed with a nucleic acid construct of the invention. These marker genes enable the identification of a successful transfer of the nucleic acid molecules via a series of different principles. Suitable markers may be selected from markers that confer antibiotic or herbicide resistance, that introduce a new metabolic trait or that allow visual selection. Examples of selectable marker genes include genes conferring resistance to antibiotics (such as nptll that phosphorylates neomycin and kanamycin, or hpt, phosphorylating hygromycin, or genes conferring resistance to, for example, bleomycin, streptomycin, tetracyclin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, gentamycin, geneticin (G418), spectinomycin or blasticidin), to herbicides (for example bar which provides resistance to Basta®; aroA or gox providing resistance against glyphosate, or the genes conferring resistance to, for example, imidazolinone, phosphinothricin or sulfonylurea), or genes that provide a metabolic trait (such as manA that allows plants to use mannose as sole carbon source or xylose isomerase for the utilisation of xylose, or antinutritive markers such as the resistance to 2-deoxyglucose). Expression of visual marker genes results in the formation of colour (for example 3-glucuronidase, GUS or 3-galactosidase with its coloured substrates, for example X-Gal), luminescence (such as the luciferin/luceferase system) or fluorescence (Green Fluorescent Protein, GFP, and derivatives thereof). This list represents only a small number of possible markers. The skilled worker is familiar with such markers. Different markers are preferred, depending on the organism and the selection method. It is known that upon stable or transient integration of nucleic acids into plant cells, only a minority of the cells takes up the foreign DNA and, if desired, integrates it into its genome, depending on the expression vector used and the transfection technique used. To identify and select these integrants, a gene coding for a selectable marker (such as the ones described above) is usually introduced into the host cells together with the gene of interest. These markers can for example be used in mutants in which these genes are not functional by, for example, deletion by conventional methods. Furthermore, nucleic acid molecules encoding a selectable marker can be introduced into a host cell on the same vector that comprises the sequence encoding the polypeptides of the invention or used in the methods of the invention, or else in a separate vector. Cells which have been stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified for example by selection (for example, cells which have integrated the selectable marker survive whereas the other cells die). The marker genes may be removed or excised from the transgenic cell once they are no longer needed. Techniques for marker gene removal are known in the art, useful techniques are described above in the definitions section. Since the marker genes, particularly genes for resistance to antibiotics and herbicides, are no longer required or are undesired in the transgenic host cell once the nucleic acids have been introduced successfully, the process according to the invention for introducing the nucleic acids advantageously employs techniques which enable the removal or excision of these marker genes. One such a method is what is known as co-transformation. The co-transformation method employs two vectors simultaneously for the transformation, one vector bearing the nucleic acid according to the invention and a second bearing the marker gene(s). A large proportion of transformants receives or, in the case of plants, comprises (up to 40% or more of the transformants), both vectors. In case of transformation with Agrobacteria, the transformants usually receive only a part of the vector, i.e. the sequence flanked by the Τ-DNA, which usually represents the expression cassette. The marker genes can subsequently be removed from the transformed plant by performing crosses. In another method, marker genes integrated into a transposon are used for the transformation together with desired nucleic acid (known as the Ac/Ds technology). The transformants can be crossed with a transposase source or the transformants are transformed with a nucleic acid construct conferring expression of a transposase, transiently or stable. In some cases (approx. 10%), the transposon jumps out of the genome of the host cell once transformation has taken place successfully and is lost. In a further number of cases, the transposon jumps to a different location. In these cases the marker gene must be eliminated by performing crosses. In microbiology, techniques were developed which make possible, or facilitate, the detection of such events. A further advantageous method relies on what is known as recombination systems; whose advantage is that elimination by crossing can be dispensed with. The bestknown system of this type is what is known as the Cre/lox system. Cre1 is a recombinase that removes the sequences located between the loxP sequences. If the marker gene is integrated between the loxP sequences, it is removed once transformation has taken place successfully, by expression of the recombinase. Further recombination systems are the HIN/HIX, FLP/FRT and REP/STB system (Tribble et al., J. Biol. Chem., 275, 2000: 22255-22267; Velmurugan et al., J. Cell Biol., 149, 2000: 553-566). A site-specific integration into the plant genome of the nucleic acid sequences according to the invention is possible. Naturally, these methods can also be applied to microorganisms such as yeast, fungi or bacteria. Τ ransqenic/T ransqene/Recombinant For the purposes of the invention, "transgenic", “transgene” or "recombinant" means with regard to, for example, a nucleic acid sequence, an expression cassette, gene construct or a vector comprising the nucleic acid sequence or an organism transformed with the nucleic acid sequences, expression cassettes or vectors according to the invention, all those constructions brought about by recombinant methods in which either (a) the nucleic acid sequences encoding proteins useful in the methods of the invention, or (b) genetic control sequence(s) which is operably linked with the nucleic acid sequence according to the invention, for example a promoter, or (c) a) and b) are not located in their natural genetic environment or have been modified by recombinant methods, it being possible for the modification to take the form of, for example, a substitution, addition, deletion, inversion or insertion of one or more nucleotide residues. The natural genetic environment is understood as meaning the natural genomic or chromosomal locus in the original plant or the presence in a genomic library. In the case of a genomic library, the natural genetic environment of the nucleic acid sequence is preferably retained, at least in part. The environment flanks the nucleic acid sequence at least on one side and has a sequence length of at least 50 bp, preferably at least 500 bp, especially preferably at least 1000 bp, most preferably at least 5000 bp. A naturally occurring expression cassette - for example the naturally occurring combination of the natural promoter of the nucleic acid sequences with the corresponding nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide useful in the methods of the present invention, as defined above - becomes a transgenic expression cassette when this expression cassette is modified by non-natural, synthetic ("artificial") methods such as, for example, mutagenic treatment. Suitable methods are described, for example, in US 5,565,350 or WO 00/15815. A transgenic plant for the purposes of the invention is thus understood as meaning, as above, that the nucleic acids used in the method of the invention are not at their natural locus in the genome of said plant, it being possible for the nucleic acids to be expressed homologously or heterologously. However, as mentioned, transgenic also means that, while the nucleic acids according to the invention or used in the inventive method are at their natural position in the genome of a plant, the sequence has been modified with regard to the natural sequence, and/or that the regulatory sequences of the natural sequences have been modified. Transgenic is preferably understood as meaning the expression of the nucleic acids according to the invention at an unnatural locus in the genome, i.e. homologous or, preferably, heterologous expression of the nucleic acids takes place. Preferred transgenic plants are mentioned herein. Transformation The term “introduction” or “transformation” as referred to herein encompasses the transfer of an exogenous polynucleotide into a host cell, irrespective of the method used for transfer. Plant tissue capable of subsequent clonal propagation, whether by organogenesis or embryogenesis, may be transformed with a genetic construct of the present invention and a whole plant regenerated there from. The particular tissue chosen will vary depending on the clonal propagation systems available for, and best suited to, the particular species being transformed. Exemplary tissue targets include leaf disks, pollen, embryos, cotyledons, hypocotyls, megagametophytes, callus tissue, existing meristematic tissue (e.g., apical meristem, axillary buds, and root meristems), and induced meristem tissue (e.g., cotyledon meristem and hypocotyl meristem). The polynucleotide may be transiently or stably introduced into a host cell and may be maintained non-integrated, for example, as a plasmid. Alternatively, it may be integrated into the host genome. The resulting transformed plant cell may then be used to regenerate a transformed plant in a manner known to persons skilled in the art. The transfer of foreign genes into the genome of a plant is called transformation. Transformation of plant species is now a fairly routine technique. Advantageously, any of several transformation methods may be used to introduce the gene of interest into a suitable ancestor cell. The methods described for the transformation and regeneration of plants from plant tissues or plant cells may be utilized for transient or for stable transformation. Transformation methods include the use of liposomes, electroporation, chemicals that increase free DNA uptake, injection of the DNA directly into the plant, particle gun bombardment, transformation using viruses or pollen and microprojection. Methods may be selected from the calcium/polyethylene glycol method for protoplasts (Krens, F.A. et al., (1982) Nature 296, 72-74; Negrutiu I et al. (1987) Plant Mol Biol 8: 363-373); electroporation of protoplasts (Shillito R.D. et al. (1985) Bio/Technol 3, 1099-1102); microinjection into plant material (Crossway A et al., (1986) Mol. Gen Genet 202: 179-185); DNA or RNA-coated particle bombardment (Klein ΤΜ et al., (1987) Nature 327: 70) infection with (non-integrative) viruses and the like. Transgenic plants, including transgenic crop plants, are preferably produced via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. An advantageous transformation method is the transformation in planta. To this end, it is possible, for example, to allow the agrobacteria to act on plant seeds or to inoculate the plant meristem with agrobacteria. It has proved particularly expedient in accordance with the invention to allow a suspension of transformed agrobacteria to act on the intact plant or at least on the flower primordia. The plant is subsequently grown on until the seeds of the treated plant are obtained (Clough and Bent, Plant J. (1998) 16, 735-743). Methods for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of rice include well known methods for rice transformation, such as those described in any of the following: European patent application ΕΡ 1198985 Α1, Aldemita and Hodges (Planta 199: 612-617, 1996); Chan et al. (Plant Mol Biol 22 (3): 491-506, 1993), Hiei et al. (Plant J 6 (2): 271-282, 1994), which disclosures are incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth. In the case of corn transformation, the preferred method is as described in either Ishida et al. (Nat. Biotechnol 14(6): 745-50, 1996) or Frame et al. (Plant Physiol 129(1): 13-22, 2002), which disclosures are incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth. Said methods are further described by way of example in Β. Jenes et al., Techniques for Gene Transfer, in: Transgenic Plants, Vol. 1, Engineering and Utilization, eds. S.D. Kung and R. Wu, Academic Press (1993) 128-143 and in Potrykus Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Molec. Biol. 42 (1991) 205-225). The nucleic acids or the construct to be expressed is preferably cloned into a vector, which is suitable for transforming Agrobacterium tumefaciens, for example pBin19 (Bevan et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 12 (1984) 8711). Agrobacteria transformed by such a vector can then be used in known manner for the transformation of plants, such as plants used as a model, like Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana is within the scope of the present invention not considered as a crop plant), or crop plants such as, by way of example, tobacco plants, for example by immersing bruised leaves or chopped leaves in an agrobacterial solution and then culturing them in suitable media. The transformation of plants by means of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is described, for example, by Hofgen and Willmitzer in Nucl. Acid Res. (1988) 16, 9877 or is known inter alia from F.F. White, Vectors for Gene Transfer in Higher Plants; in Transgenic Plants, Vol. 1, Engineering and Utilization, eds. S.D. Kung and R. Wu, Academic Press, 1993, ρρ. 15-38. In addition to the transformation of somatic cells, which then have to be regenerated into intact plants, it is also possible to transform the cells of plant meristems and in particular those cells which develop into gametes. In this case, the transformed gametes follow the natural plant development, giving rise to transgenic plants. Thus, for example, seeds of Arabidopsis are treated with agrobacteria and seeds are obtained from the developing plants of which a certain proportion is transformed and thus transgenic [Feldman, ΚΑ and Marks MD (1987). Mol Gen Genet 208:274-289; Feldmann Κ (1992). In: C Koncz, Ν-Η Chua and J Shell, eds, Methods in Arabidopsis Research. Word Scientific, Singapore, ρρ. 274-289]. Alternative methods are based on the repeated removal of the inflorescences and incubation of the excision site in the center of the rosette with transformed agrobacteria, whereby transformed seeds can likewise be obtained at a later point in time (Chang (1994). Plant J. 5: 551-558; Katavic (1994). Mol Gen Genet, 245: 363-370). However, an especially effective method is the vacuum infiltration method with its modifications such as the “floral dip” method. In the case of vacuum infiltration of Arabidopsis, intact plants under reduced pressure are treated with an agrobacterial suspension [Bechthold, Ν (1993). C R Acad Sci Paris Life Sci, 316: 1194-1199], while in the case of the ’’floral dip” method the developing floral tissue is incubated briefly with a surfactanttreated agrobacterial suspension [Clough, SJ and Bent AF (1998) The Plant J. 16, 735-743]. A certain proportion of transgenic seeds are harvested in both cases, and these seeds can be distinguished from non-transgenic seeds by growing under the above-described selective conditions. In addition the stable transformation of plastids is of advantages because plastids are inherited maternally is most crops reducing or eliminating the risk of transgene flow through pollen. The transformation of the chloroplast genome is generally achieved by a process which has been schematically displayed in Klaus et al., 2004 [Nature Biotechnology 22 (2), 225-229]. Briefly the sequences to be transformed are cloned together with a selectable marker gene between flanking sequences homologous to the chloroplast genome. These homologous flanking sequences direct site specific integration into the plastome. Plastidal transformation has been described for many different plant species and an overview is given in Bock (2001) Transgenic plastids in basic research and plant biotechnology. J Mol Biol. 2001 Sep 21; 312 (3):425-38 or Maliga, Ρ (2003) Progress towards commercialization of plastid transformation technology. Trends Biotechnol. 21, 20-28. Further biotechnological progress has recently been reported in form of marker free plastid transformants, which can be produced by a transient co-integrated maker gene (Klaus et al., 2004, Nature Biotechnology 22(2), 225-229). T-DNA activation tagging T-DNA activation tagging (Hayashi et al. Science (1992) 1350-1353), involves insertion of Τ-DNA, usually containing a promoter (may also be a translation enhancer or an intron), in the genomic region of the gene of interest or 10 kb up- or downstream of the coding region of a gene in a configuration such that the promoter directs expression of the targeted gene. Typically, regulation of expression of the targeted gene by its natural promoter is disrupted and the gene falls under the control of the newly introduced promoter. The promoter is typically embedded in a T-DNA. This T-DNA is randomly inserted into the plant genome, for example, through Agrobacterium infection and leads to modified expression of genes near the inserted T-DNA. The resulting transgenic plants show dominant phenotypes due to modified expression of genes close to the introduced promoter. TILLING The term “TILLING” is an abbreviation of “Targeted Induced Local Lesions In Genomes” and refers to a mutagenesis technology useful to generate and/or identify nucleic acids encoding proteins with modified expression and/or activity. TILLING also allows selection of plants carrying such mutant variants. These mutant variants may exhibit modified expression, either in strength or in location or in timing (if the mutations affect the promoter for example). These mutant variants may exhibit higher activity than that exhibited by the gene in its natural form. TILLING combines high-density mutagenesis with high-throughput screening methods. The steps typically followed in TILLING are: (a) EMS mutagenesis (Redei GP and Koncz C (1992) In Methods in Arabidopsis Research, Koncz C, Chua ΝΗ, Schell J, eds. Singapore, World Scientific Publishing Co, ρρ. 16-82; Feldmann et al., (1994) In Meyerowitz EM, Somerville CR, eds, Arabidopsis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, ρρ 137-172; Lightner J and Caspar Τ (1998) In J Martinez-Zapater, J Salinas, eds, Methods on Molecular Biology, Vol. 82. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ, ρρ 91-104); (b) DNA preparation and pooling of individuals; (c) PCR amplification of a region of interest; (d) denaturation and annealing to allow formation of heteroduplexes; (℮) DHPLC, where the presence of a heteroduplex in a pool is detected as an extra peak in the chromatogram; (f) identification of the mutant individual; and (g) sequencing of the mutant PCR product. Methods for TILLING are well known in the art (McCallum et al., (2000) Nat Biotechnol 18: 455-457; reviewed by Stemple (2004) Nat Rev Genet 5(2): 145-50). Homologous recombination Homologous recombination allows introduction in a genome of a selected nucleic acid at a defined selected position. Homologous recombination is a standard technology used routinely in biological sciences for lower organisms such as yeast or the moss Physcomitrella. Methods for performing homologous recombination in plants have been described not only for model plants (Offringa et al. (1990) ΕΜΒΟ J 9(10): 3077-84) but also for crop plants, for example rice (Terada et al. (2002) Nat Biotech 20(10): 1030-4; lida and Terada (2004) Curr Opin Biotech 15(2): 132-8), and approaches exist that are generally applicable regardless of the target organism (Miller et al, Nature Biotechnol. 25, 778-785, 2007). Yield The term “yield” in general means a measurable produce of economic value, typically related to a specified crop, to an area, and to a period of time. Individual plant parts directly contribute to yield based on their number, size and/or weight, or the actual yield is the yield per square meter for a crop and year, which is determined by dividing total production (includes both harvested and appraised production) by planted square meters. The term “yield” of a plant may relate to vegetative biomass (root and/or shoot biomass), to reproductive organs, and/or to propagules (such as seeds) of that plant. Early vigour “Early vigour” refers to active healthy well-balanced growth especially during early stages of plant growth, and may result from increased plant fitness due to, for example, the plants being better adapted to their environment (i.e. optimizing the use of energy resources and partitioning between shoot and root). Plants having early vigour also show increased seedling survival and a better establishment of the crop, which often results in highly uniform fields (with the crop growing in uniform manner, i.e. with the majority of plants reaching the various stages of development at substantially the same time), and often better and higher yield. Therefore, early vigour may be determined by measuring various factors, such as thousand kernel weight, percentage germination, percentage emergence, seedling growth, seedling height, root length, root and shoot biomass and many more. Increase/Improve/Enhance The terms “increase”, “improve” or “enhance” are interchangeable and shall mean in the sense of the application at least a 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% or 10%, preferably at least 15% or 20%, more preferably 25%, 30%, 35% or 40% more yield and/or growth in comparison to control plants as defined herein. Seed yield Increased seed yield may manifest itself as one or more of the following: a) an increase in seed biomass (total seed weight) which may be on an individual seed basis and/or per plant and/or per square meter; b) increased number of flowers per plant; c) increased number of (filled) seeds; d) increased seed filling rate (which is expressed as the ratio between the number of filled seeds divided by the total number of seeds); ℮) increased harvest index, which is expressed as a ratio of the yield of harvestable parts, such as seeds, divided by the total biomass; and f) increased thousand kernel weight (TKW), and g) increased number of primary panicles, which is extrapolated from the number of filled seeds counted and their total weight. An increased TKW may result from an increased seed size and/or seed weight, and may also result from an increase in embryo and/or endosperm size. An increase in seed yield may also be manifested as an increase in seed size and/or seed volume. Furthermore, an increase in seed yield may also manifest itself as an increase in seed area and/or seed length and/or seed width and/or seed perimeter. Increased seed yield may also result in modified architecture, or may occur because of modified architecture. Greenness Index The “greenness index” as used herein is calculated from digital images of plants. For each pixel belonging to the plant object on the image, the ratio of the green value versus the red value (in the RGB model for encoding color) is calculated. The greenness index is expressed as the percentage of pixels for which the green-to-red ratio exceeds a given threshold. Under normal growth conditions, under salt stress growth conditions, and under reduced nutrient availability growth conditions, the greenness index of plants is measured in the last imaging before flowering. In contrast, under drought stress growth conditions, the greenness index of plants is measured in the first imaging after drought. Plant The term “plant” as used herein encompasses whole plants, ancestors and progeny of the plants and plant parts, including seeds, shoots, stems, leaves, roots (including tubers), flowers, and tissues and organs, wherein each of the aforementioned comprise the gene/nucleic acid of interest. The term “plant” also encompasses plant cells, suspension cultures, callus tissue, embryos, meristematic regions, gametophytes, sporophytes, pollen and microspores, again wherein each of the aforementioned comprises the gene/nucleic acid of interest.

The nucleic acid to be introduced into a plant (and therefore useful in performing the methods of the invention) is any nucleic acid encoding the type of protein which will now be described, hereafter also named “RHL1 nucleic acid” or “RHL1 gene”.

Concerning ny reference hereinafter to a “protein useful in the methods of the invention” is taken to mean a TRY-like polypeptide as defined herein.

The nucleic acid to be introduced into a plant (and therefore useful in performing the methods of the invention) is any nucleic acid encoding the type of protein which will now be described, hereafter also named “TRY-like nucleic acid” or “TRY-like gene”. A “TRY-like polypeptide” as defined herein refers to any polypeptide comprising a Myb-like DNA-binding domain (PFam domain PF00249.17, SMART domain SM00717, ProfileScan domain PS50090, Panther PTHR10641 :SF26).

Any reference hereinafter to a “nucleic acid useful in the methods of the invention” is taken to mean a nucleic acid capable of encoding such a BZR polypeptide. The nucleic acid to be introduced into a plant (and therefore useful in performing the methods of the invention) is any nucleic acid encoding the type of protein which will now be described, hereafter also named “BZR nucleic acid” or “BZR gene”. A “BZR polypeptide” as defined herein refers to any transcription factor polypeptide comprising a BZR1 transcriptional repressor domain (Interpro accession number: IPR008540). Typically the N-terminus of BZR polypetides comprises one or more nuclear localization signals and a bHLH-like DNA binding domain (Yin et al. (2008) Plant Physiology 147:280-295. BZR transcription factors are well known in the art. BZR polypeptides belong to a small family of proteins of plant origin which function as transcriptional modulators involved in controlling the response to Brassinosteroids (BRs). The BZR polypeptide useful in the methods of the invention comprises a domain having in increasing order of preference at least 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to the BZR1 transcriptional repressor domain in SEQ ID NO: 238 located at amino acid position (coordinates) 10 to 157 in SEQ ID NO: 238 or to a BZR transcriptional repressor domain comprised in any of the polypeptides of Table Α4. Typically, the BZR polypeptides useful in the methods of the invention have a conserved bHLH-like domain located at the N-terminus of the protein for example such domain corresponds to the sequence RERRRRAIAAKIFTGLRSQGNYKLPKHCDNNEVLKALCLE AGWIVHEDGT: (SEQ ID NO: 326) located at positions 27 to 76 of SEQ ID NO: 238. Additionally the BZR polypeptide useful in the methods of the invention may comprise a domain having in increasing order of preference at least 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to a bHLH-like domain as represented by SEQ ID NO: 326.

Alternatively, the homologue of a BZR protein has in increasing order of preference at least 20%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% overall sequence identity to the amino acid represented by SEQ ID NO: 238, provided that the homologous protein comprises the conserved BZR domain as outlined above. The overall sequence identity is determined using a global alignment algorithm, such as the Needleman Wunsch algorithm in the program GAP (GCG Wisconsin Package, Accelrys), preferably with default parameters and preferably with sequences of mature proteins (i.e. without taking into account secretion signals or transit peptides). Compared to overall sequence identity, the sequence identity will generally be higher when only conserved domains or motifs are considered. The terms “domain”, “signature” and “motif” are defined in the “definitions” section herein. Specialist databases exist for the identification of domains, for example, SMART (Schultz et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 5857-5864; Letunic et al. (2002) Nucleic Acids Res 30, 242-244), InterPro (Mulder et al., (2003) Nucl. Acids.

A set of tools for in silico analysis of protein sequences is available on the ExPASy proteomics server (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (Gasteiger et al., ExPASy: the proteomics server for in-depth protein knowledge and analysis, Nucleic Acids Res. 31:3784-3788(2003)). Domains or motifs may also be identified using routine techniques, such as by sequence alignment. Concerning TGase plypeptides, the term “domain” and “motif is defined in the “definitions” section herein. Specialist databases exist for the identification of domains, for example, SMART (Schultz et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 5857-5864; Letunic et al.

Res. 32: D134-D137, (2004)), or Pfam (Bateman et al., Nucleic Acids Research 30(1): 276-280 (2002). A set of tools for in silico analysis of protein sequences is available on the ExPASy proteomics server (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (Gasteiger et al., ExPASy: the proteomics server for in-depth protein knowledge and analysis, Nucleic Acids Res. 31:3784-3788(2003)). Domains may also be identified using routine techniques, such as by sequence alignment. An alignment of the polypeptides of Table Α2 herein, is shown in Figure 6. Such alignments are useful for identifying the most conserved domains or motifs between the TGase polypeptides as defined herein. One such domain is a domain comprising at least one coiled coil, marked by X’s in Figure 6, and as represented by SEQ ID NO: 70. Concerning TGase polypeptides, coiled coils are domains that are important to identify for protein-protein interactions, such as oligomerization, either of identical proteins, of proteins of the same family, or of unrelated proteins. Recently much progress has been made in computational prediction of coiled coils from sequence data. Among algorithms well known to a person skilled in the art are available at the ExPASy Proteomics tools COILS, PAIRCOIL, PAIRCOIL2, MULTICOIL, or MARCOIL, hosted by the Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics. In Example 4 and Figure 5, are shown respectively the numerical and graphical results of SEQ ID NO: 45 as produced by the COILS algorithm analysis. A domain comprising at one coiled coil is identified in the TGase polypeptide sequence as represented by SEQ ID NO: 45, and is represented as in SEQ ID NO: 70. Methods for the alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art, such methods include GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA and TFASTA. GAP uses the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch ((1970) J Mol Biol 48: 443-453) to find the global (i.e. spanning the complete sequences) alignment of two sequences that maximizes the number of matches and minimizes the number of gaps. The BLAST algorithm (Altschul et al. (1990) J Mol Biol 215: 403-10) calculates percent sequence identity and performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between the two sequences. The software for performing BLAST analysis is publicly available through the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Homologues may readily be identified using, for example, the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment algorithm (version 1.83), with the default pairwise alignment parameters, and a scoring method in percentage. Global percentages of similarity and identity may also be determined using one of the methods available in the MatGAT software package (Campanella et al., BMC Bioinformatics. 2003 Jul 10;4:29. MatGAT: an application that generates similarity/identity matrices using protein or DNA sequences.). Minor manual editing may be performed to optimise alignment between conserved motifs, as would be apparent to a person skilled in the art. Furthermore, instead of using full-length sequences for the identification of homologues, specific domains may also be used. The sequence identity values may be determined over the entire nucleic acid or amino acid sequence or over selected domains or conserved motif(s), using the programs mentioned above using the default parameters. For local alignments, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is particularly useful (Smith TF, Waterman MS (1981) J. Mol. Biol 147(1 );195-7). Concerning TGase polypeptides, Example 3 herein describes in Table Β2 the percentage identity between the TGase polypeptide as represented by SEQ ID NO: 45 and the TGase polypeptides listed in Table Α2, which can be as low as 26% amino acid sequence identity. The task of protein subcellular localisation prediction is important and well studied. Knowing a protein’s localisation helps elucidate its function. Experimental methods for protein localization range from immunolocalization to tagging of proteins using green fluorescent protein (GFP) or beta-glucuronidase (GUS). Such methods are accurate although labor-intensive compared with computational methods. Recently much progress has been made in computational prediction of protein localisation from sequence data. Among algorithms well known to a person skilled in the art are available at the ExPASy Proteomics tools hosted by the Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics, for example, PSort, TargetP, ChloroP, LocTree, Predotar, LipoP, MITOPROT, PATS, PTS1, SignalP, ΤΜΗΜΜ, and others. The subcellular localisation of polypeptides useful in performing the methods of the invention was previously described in the literature (Villalobos et al. (2004) Gene 336: 93-104). In particular SEQ ID NO: 45 of the present invention is assigned to the plastidic (chloroplastic) compartment of plant cells. Methods for targeting to plastids are well known in the art and include the use of transit peptides. Table 3 below shows examples of transit peptides which can be used to target any TGase polypeptide to a plastid, which TGase polypeptide is not, in its natural form, normally targeted to a plastid, or which TGase polypeptide in its natural form is targeted to a plastid by virtue of a different transit peptide (for example, its natural transit peptide). Cloning a nucleic acid sequence encoding a transit peptide upstream and in-frame of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide (for example, a TGase polypeptide lacking its own transit peptide), involves standard molecular techniques that are well-known in the art.

(2004) Gene 336: 93-104). Furthermore, RHL1 polypeptides typically have DNA biding activity. Tools and techniques for measuring DNA biding activity are well known in the art. Further details are provided in the Examples section. In addition, RHL1 polypeptides, when expressed in rice according to the methods of the present invention as outlined in the Examples section, give plants having increased yield related traits, in particular any one of early vigour, increased total seed weight per plant, increased number of seeds, increased number of filled seeds and increased harvest index. Furthermore, TRY-like polypeptides (at least in their native form) typically have DNA binding activity. Tools and techniques for measuring DNA binding activity are well known in the art. In addition, TRY-like polypeptides, when expressed in rice according to the methods of the present invention as outlined in the Examples section, give plants having increased yield related traits, in particular one or more of increased emergence vigour, increased fill rate, increased harvest index, increased total number of seeds, increased thousand kernel weight, increased number of first panicles, increased number of filled seeds and/or increased total weight of seeds. Furthermore, BZR polypeptides (at least in their native form) typically have DNA-binding activity and optionally protein-binding activity. Tools and techniques for measuring DNA binding activity are well known in the art. For example the EMSA technique which is based is based on the observation that protein:DNA complexes migrate more slowly than free DNA molecules when subjected to non-denaturing polyacrylamide or agarose gel electrophoresis may be used (He et al. Science 307, 134-138 (2005)). Techniques useful to determine interaction between polypeptides are well known in the art and include but are not limited to yeast two hybrid, inmunoprecipation, or affinity purification of tagged proteins such as that used in TAP (Tandem Affinity Purification) technology Rigaut et al. Nat Biotechnol. 1999 Oct;17(10):1030-2. Preferably, BZR polypeptides useful in the methods of the invention have DNA binding activity and bind a DNA fragment of preferably and in increasing order of preference at least 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, nucleotides long comprising a BRRE element (Brassinosteroid response element) as represented by SEQ ID NO: 327 element and/or an Εbox element as represented by SEQ ID NO: 328. BRRE elements and E-box elements are well known in the art (He et al. 2005; Yin et al 2008). Preferably the BRRE element and the E-box element comprises a sequence having at least 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% sequence identity to the sequence CGTGC(T/C)G (BRRE element: SEQ ID NO: 90) and CANNTC (E-box: SEQ ID NO: 328) respectively. More preferably the DNA fragment to which the BZR polypeptide binds is selected from the CPD, DWF4, UBC and CNX5 promoter as described by He el al. 2005. In addition, BZR polypeptides, when expressed in rice according to the methods of the present invention as outlined in the Examples section, give plants having increased seed yield, in particular increased number of filled seeds. Concerning RHL1 polypeptides, the present invention is illustrated by transforming plants with the nucleic acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, encoding the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. However, performance of the invention is not restricted to these sequences; the methods of the invention may advantageously be performed using any RHL1-encoding nucleic acid or RHL1 polypeptide as defined herein. Concerning RHL1 polypeptides, examples of nucleic acids encoding RHL1 polypeptides are given in Table Α1 of Example 1 herein. Such nucleic acids are useful in performing the methods of the invention. The amino acid sequences given in Table Α1 of Example 1 are example sequences of orthologues and paralogues of the RHL1 polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 2, the terms “orthologues” and “paralogues” being as defined herein. Further orthologues and paralogues may readily be identified by performing a so-called reciprocal blast search. Typically, this involves a first BLAST involving BLASTing a query sequence (for example using any of the sequences listed in Table Α1 of Example 1) against any sequence database, such as the publicly available NCBI database. BLASTN or TBLASTX (using standard default values) are generally used when starting from a nucleotide sequence, and BLASTP or TBLASTN (using standard default values) when starting from a protein sequence. The BLAST results may optionally be filtered. The full-length sequences of either the filtered results or non-filtered results are then BLASTed back (second BLAST) against sequences from the organism from which the query sequence is derived (where the query sequence is SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2, the second BLAST would therefore be against Arabidopsis thaliana sequences). The results of the first and second BLASTS are then compared. A paralogue is identified if a high-ranking hit from the first blast is from the same species as from which the query sequence is derived, a BLAST back then ideally results in the query sequence amongst the highest hits; an orthologue is identified if a high-ranking hit in the first BLAST is not from the same species as from which the query sequence is derived, and preferably results upon BLAST back in the query sequence being among the highest hits. Concerning TGase polypeptides, the present invention is illustrated by transforming plants with the nucleic acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 44, encoding the TGase polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 45. However, performance of the invention is not restricted to these sequences; the methods of the invention may advantageously be performed using any nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide as defined herein. Concerning TGase polypeptides, examples of nucleic acid sequences encoding TGase polypeptides are given in Table Α2 of Example 1 herein.

The polypeptide sequences given in Table Α2 of Example 1 are example sequences of orthologues and paralogues of the TGase polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 45, the terms “orthologues” and “paralogues” being as defined herein. Further orthologues and paralogues may readily be identified by performing a so-called reciprocal blast search. Typically, this involves a first BLAST involving BLASTing a query sequence (for example using any of the sequences listed in Table A of Example 1) against any sequence database, such as the publicly available NCBI database. BLASTN or TBLASTX (using standard default values) are generally used when starting from a nucleotide sequence, and BLASTP or TBLASTN (using standard default values) when starting from a protein sequence. The BLAST results may optionally be filtered. The full-length sequences of either the filtered results or non-filtered results are then BLASTed back (second BLAST) against sequences from the organism from which the query sequence is derived (where the query sequence is SEQ ID NO: 44 or SEQ ID NO: 45, the second BLAST would therefore be against Oryza sativa sequences). The results of the first and second BLASTS are then compared. A paralogue is identified if a high-ranking hit from the first blast is from the same species as from which the query sequence is derived, a BLAST back then ideally results in the query sequence amongst the highest hits; an orthologue is identified if a high-ranking hit in the first BLAST is not from the same species as from which the query sequence is derived, and preferably results upon BLAST back in the query sequence being among the highest hits. Concerning TRY-like polypeptides, the present invention is illustrated by transforming plants with the nucleic acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 75, encoding the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 76. However, performance of the invention is not restricted to these sequences; the methods of the invention may advantageously be performed using any TRY-like-encoding nucleic acid or TRY-like polypeptide as defined herein.

The results of the first and second BLASTS are then compared. A paralogue is identified if a high-ranking hit from the first blast is from the same species as from which the query sequence is derived, a BLAST back then ideally results in the query sequence amongst the highest hits; an orthologue is identified if a high-ranking hit in the first BLAST is not from the same species as from which the query sequence is derived, and preferably results upon BLAST back in the query sequence being among the highest hits. Concerning BZR polypeptides, the present invention is illustrated by transforming plants with the nucleic acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 238, encoding the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 239. However, performance of the invention is not restricted to these sequences; the methods of the invention may advantageously be performed using any BZR-encoding nucleic acid or BZR polypeptide as defined herein. Concerning BZR polypeptides, examples of nucleic acids encoding BZR polypeptides are given in Table Α4 of Example 1 herein. Such nucleic acids are useful in performing the methods of the invention.

The results of the first and second BLASTS are then compared. A paralogue is identified if a high-ranking hit from the first blast is from the same species as from which the query sequence is derived, a BLAST back then ideally results in the query sequence amongst the highest hits; an orthologue is identified if a high-ranking hit in the first BLAST is not from the same species as from which the query sequence is derived, and preferably results upon BLAST back in the query sequence being among the highest hits. High-ranking hits are those having a low E-value. The lower the E-value, the more significant the score (or in other words the lower the chance that the hit was found by chance). Computation of the E-value is well known in the art. In addition to E-values, comparisons are also scored by percentage identity. Percentage identity refers to the number of identical nucleotides (or amino acids) between the two compared nucleic acid (or polypeptide) sequences over a particular length. In the case of large families, ClustalW may be used, followed by a neighbour joining tree, to help visualize clustering of related genes and to identify orthologues and paralogues.

Concerning RHL1 polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants having enhanced yield-related traits. In particular performance of the methods of the invention gives plants having increased yield, especially increased seed yield relative to control plants. The terms “yield” and “seed yield” are described in more detail in the “definitions” section herein. Concerning TGase polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants having increased seed yield-related traits relative to control plants. The terms “yield” and “seed yield” are described in more detail in the “definitions” section herein. Concerning TRY-like polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants having enhanced yield-related traits. In particular performance of the methods of the invention gives plants having increased early vigour (emergence vigour) and increased yield, especially increased seed yield relative to control plants. The terms “early vigour”, “yield” and “seed yield” are described in more detail in the “definitions” section herein. Concerning BZR polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants having increased seed yield Concerning RHL1 polypeptides, reference herein to enhanced yield-related traits is taken to mean an increase in biomass (weight) of one or more parts of a plant, which may include aboveground (harvestable) parts and/or (harvestable) parts below ground. In particular, such harvestable parts are seeds, and performance of the methods of the invention results in plants having increased seed yield relative to the seed yield of control plants. Concerning TRY-like polypeptides, reference herein to enhanced yield-related traits is taken to mean an increase in early vigour and/or an increase in biomass (weight) of one or more parts of a plant, which may include aboveground (harvestable) parts and/or (harvestable) parts below ground. In particular, such harvestable parts are seeds, and performance of the methods of the invention results in plants having increased seed yield relative to the seed yield of control plants. Concerning BZR polypeptides, reference herein to increase seed yield is taken to mean any one or more of the following seed parameters: an increase in the seed weight, the total number of seed, the number of filled seeds, the seed filing rate, the proportion of filled seeds, the size of the seed, the volume of the seed harvested. The skill in art will recognized that the abovementioned seed yield parameters may be expressed in different units including but not limited to per panicle and/or per plant and/or per harvest. Performance of the methods of the invention results in plants having increased seed yield relative to the seed yield of control plants. Taking corn as an example, a yield increase may be manifested as one or more of the following: increase in the number of plants established per square meter, an increase in the number of ears per plant, an increase in the number of rows, number of kernels per row, kernel weight, thousand kernel weight, ear length/diameter, increase in the seed filling rate (which is the number of filled seeds divided by the total number of seeds and multiplied by 100), among others. Taking rice as an example, a yield increase may manifest itself as an increase in one or more of the following: number of plants per square meter, number of panicles per plant, number of spikelets per panicle, number of flowers (florets) per panicle (which is expressed as a ratio of the number of filled seeds over the number of primary panicles), increase in the seed filling rate (which is the number of filled seeds divided by the total number of seeds and multiplied by 100), increase in thousand kernel weight, among others. The present invention provides a method for increasing yield, especially seed yield of plants, relative to control plants, which method comprises modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a RHL1 polypeptide, ora TRY-like polypeptide, as defined herein. The present invention also provides a method for increasing seed yield-related traits of plants relative to control plants, which method comprises increasing expression in a plant of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide as defined herein. The present invention furthermore provides a method for increasing seed yield of plants, relative to control plants, which method comprises modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a BZR polypeptide as defined herein. Since the transgenic plants according to the present invention have increased yield and/or increased seed yield-related traits and/or yield, it is likely that these plants exhibit an increased growth rate (during at least part of their life cycle), relative to the growth rate of control plants at a corresponding stage in their life cycle. The increased growth rate may be specific to one or more parts of a plant (including seeds), or may be throughout substantially the whole plant. Plants having an increased growth rate may have a shorter life cycle. The life cycle of a plant may be taken to mean the time needed to grow from a dry mature seed up to the stage where the plant has produced dry mature seeds, similar to the starting material. This life cycle may be influenced by factors such as early vigour, growth rate, greenness index, flowering time and speed of seed maturation. The increase in growth rate may take place at one or more stages in the life cycle of a plant or during substantially the whole plant life cycle. Increased growth rate during the early stages in the life cycle of a plant may reflect enhanced vigour. The increase in growth rate may alter the harvest cycle of a plant allowing plants to be sown later and/or harvested sooner than would otherwise be possible (a similar effect may be obtained with earlier flowering time). If the growth rate is sufficiently increased, it may allow for the further sowing of seeds of the same plant species (for example sowing and harvesting of rice plants followed by sowing and harvesting of further rice plants all within one conventional growing period). Similarly, if the growth rate is sufficiently increased, it may allow for the further sowing of seeds of different plants species (for example the sowing and harvesting of corn plants followed by, for example, the sowing and optional harvesting of soybean, potato or any other suitable plant). Harvesting additional times from the same rootstock in the case of some crop plants may also be possible. Altering the harvest cycle of a plant may lead to an increase in annual biomass production per square meter (due to an increase in the number of times (say in a year) that any particular plant may be grown and harvested). An increase in growth rate may also allow for the cultivation of transgenic plants in a wider geographical area than their wild-type counterparts, since the territorial limitations for growing a crop are often determined by adverse environmental conditions either at the time of planting (early season) or at the time of harvesting (late season). Such adverse conditions may be avoided if the harvest cycle is shortened. The growth rate may be determined by deriving various parameters from growth curves, such parameters may be: T-Mid (the time taken for plants to reach 50% of their maximal size) and T-90 (time taken for plants to reach 90% of their maximal size), amongst others. According to a preferred feature of the present invention, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants having an increased growth rate relative to control plants. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for increasing the growth rate of plants, which method comprises modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a RHL1 polypeptide, or a TGase polypeptide, or TRY-like polypeptide, a BZR polypeptide, as defined herein. Increased seed yield-related traits occur whether the plant is under non-stress conditions or whether the plant is exposed to various stresses compared to control plants grown under comparable conditions. Plants typically respond to exposure to stress by growing more slowly. In conditions of severe stress, the plant may even stop growing altogether. Mild stress on the other hand is defined herein as being any stress to which a plant is exposed which does not result in the plant ceasing to grow altogether without the capacity to resume growth. Mild stress in the sense of the invention leads to a reduction in the growth of the stressed plants of less than 40%, 35% or 30%, preferably less than 25%, 20% or 15%, more preferably less than 14%, 13%, 12%, 11% or 10% or less in comparison to the control plant under non-stress conditions. Due to advances in agricultural practices (irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments) severe stresses are not often encountered in cultivated crop plants. As a consequence, the compromised growth induced by mild stress is often an undesirable feature for agriculture. Mild stresses are the everyday biotic and/or abiotic (environmental) stresses to which a plant is exposed. Abiotic stresses may be due to drought or excess water, anaerobic stress, salt stress, chemical toxicity, oxidative stress and hot, cold or freezing temperatures. The abiotic stress may be an osmotic stress caused by a water stress (particularly due to drought), salt stress, oxidative stress or an ionic stress. Biotic stresses are typically those stresses caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, nematodes, and insects. The term “non-stress” conditions as used herein are those environmental conditions that allow optimal growth of plants. Persons skilled in the art are aware of normal soil conditions and climatic conditions for a given location. In particular, the methods of the present invention may be performed under non-stress conditions or under conditions of mild drought to give plants having increased yield relative to control plants. As reported in Wang et al. (Planta (2003) 218: 1-14), abiotic stress leads to a series of morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular changes that adversely affect plant growth and productivity. Drought, salinity, extreme temperatures and oxidative stress are known to be interconnected and may induce growth and cellular damage through similar mechanisms. Rabbani et al. (Plant Physiol (2003) 133: 1755-1767) describes a particularly high degree of “cross talk” between drought stress and high-salinity stress. For example, drought and/or salinisation are manifested primarily as osmotic stress, resulting in the disruption of homeostasis and ion distribution in the cell. Oxidative stress, which frequently accompanies high or low temperature, salinity or drought stress, may cause denaturing of functional and structural proteins. As a consequence, these diverse environmental stresses often activate similar cell signalling pathways and cellular responses, such as the production of stress proteins, up-regulation of anti-oxidants, accumulation of compatible solutes and growth arrest. The term “non-stress” conditions as used herein are those environmental conditions that allow optimal growth of plants. Persons skilled in the art are aware of normal soil conditions and climatic conditions for a given location. Plants with optimal growth conditions, (grown under non-stress conditions) typically yield in increasing order of preference at least 97%, 95%, 92%, 90%, 87%, 85%, 83%, 80%, 77% or 75% of the average production of such plant in a given environment. Average production may be calculated on harvest and/or season basis. Persons skilled in the art are aware of average yield productions of a crop. The term “abiotic stress” as defined herein is taken to mean any one or more of: water stress (due to drought or excess water), anaerobic stress, salt stress, temperature stress (due to hot, cold or freezing temperatures), chemical toxicity stress and oxidative stress. According to one aspect of the invention, the abiotic stress is an osmotic stress, selected from water stress, salt stress, oxidative stress and ionic stress. Preferably, the water stress is drought stress. The term salt stress is not restricted to common salt (NaCI), but may be any stress caused by one or more of: NaCI, KCI, LiCI, MgCI2, CaCI2, amongst others. Performance of the methods of the invention gives plants having increased seed yield-related traits, under abiotic stress conditions relative to control plants grown in comparable stress conditions. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for increasing seed yield-related traits, in plants grown under abiotic stress conditions, which method comprises increasing expression in a plant of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide. According to one aspect of the invention, the abiotic stress is an osmotic stress, selected from one or more of the following: water stress, salt stress, oxidative stress and ionic stress. Another example of abiotic environmental stress is the reduced availability of one or more nutrients that need to be assimilated by the plants for growth and development. Because of the strong influence of nutrition utilization efficiency on plant yield and product quality, a huge amount of fertilizer is poured onto fields to optimize plant growth and quality. Productivity of plants ordinarily is limited by three primary nutrients, phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen, which is usually the rate-limiting element in plant growth of these three. Therefore the major nutritional element required for plant growth is nitrogen (Ν). It is a constituent of numerous important compounds found in living cells, including amino acids, proteins (enzymes), nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. 1.5% to 2% of plant dry matter is nitrogen and approximately 16% of total plant protein. Thus, nitrogen availability is a major limiting factor for crop plant growth and production (Frink et al. (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96(4): 1175-1180), and has as well a major impact on protein accumulation and amino acid composition. Therefore, of great interest are crop plants with increased seed yield-related traits, when grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions. Performance of the methods of the invention gives plants grown under conditions of reduced nutrient availability, particularly under conditions of reduced nitrogen availably, having increased seed yield-related traits relative to control plants grown under comparable conditions. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for increasing seed yield-related traits in plants grown under conditions of reduced nutrient availably, preferably reduced nitrogen availability, which method comprises increasing expression in a plant of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide. Reduced nutrient availability may result from a deficiency or excess of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphates and other phosphorous-containing compounds, potassium, calcium, cadmium, magnesium, manganese, iron and boron, amongst others. Preferably, reduced nutrient availably is reduced nitrogen availability. Concerning RHL1 polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants grown under non-stress conditions or under mild drought conditions increased yield relative to control plants grown under comparable conditions. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for increasing yield in plants grown under non-stress conditions or under mild drought conditions, which method comprises modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a RHL1 polypeptide. Concerning TGase polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants grown under non-stress conditions or under mild stress conditions having increased seed yield-related traits, relative to control plants grown under comparable conditions. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for increasing seed yield-related traits in plants grown under non-stress conditions or under mild stress conditions, which method comprises increasing expression in a plant of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide. Concerning TRY-like polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants grown under non-stress conditions or under mild drought conditions increased yield relative to control plants grown under comparable conditions. Therefore, according to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for increasing yield in plants grown under non-stress conditions or under mild drought conditions, which method comprises modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a TRY-like polypeptide. Concerning BZR polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants grown under non-stress conditions or under mild drought conditions increased seed yield relative to control plants grown under comparable conditions. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for increasing seed yield in plants grown under non-stress conditions or under mild drought conditions, which method comprises modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a BZR polypeptide. Concerning RHL1 polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants grown under conditions of nutrient deficiency, particularly under conditions of nitrogen deficiency, increased yield relative to control plants grown under comparable conditions. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for increasing yield in plants grown under conditions of nutrient deficiency, which method comprises modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a RHL1 polypeptide. Nutrient deficiency may result from a lack of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphates and other phosphorous-containing compounds, potassium, calcium, cadmium, magnesium, manganese, iron and boron, amongst others. Concerning TRY-like polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants grown under conditions of nutrient deficiency, particularly under conditions of nitrogen deficiency, increased yield relative to control plants grown under comparable conditions. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for increasing yield in plants grown under conditions of nutrient deficiency, which method comprises modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a TRY-like polypeptide. Nutrient deficiency may result from a lack of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphates and other phosphorous-containing compounds, potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, iron and boron, amongst others. In another embodiment of the invention, the improved yield related traits are obtained under conditions of nitrogen deficiency. Concerning BZR polypeptides, performance of the methods of the invention gives plants grown under conditions of nutrient deficiency, particularly under conditions of nitrogen deficiency, increased seed yield relative to control plants grown under comparable conditions. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for increasing seed yield in plants grown under conditions of nutrient deficiency, which method comprises modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a BZR polypeptide. Nutrient deficiency may result from a lack of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphates and other phosphorous-containing compounds, potassium, calcium, cadmium, magnesium, manganese, iron and boron, amongst others.

The present invention encompasses plants or parts thereof (including seeds) or cells thereof obtainable by the methods according to the present invention. The plants or parts thereof comprise a nucleic acid transgene encoding a RHL1 polypeptide, or a TGase polypeptide, or a TRY-like polypeptide, or a BZR polypeptide, as defined above, operably linked to a promoter functioning in plants. The invention also provides genetic constructs and vectors to facilitate introduction and/or expression in plants of nucleic acids sequences encoding RHL1 polypeptides, or TGase polypeptides, or TRY-like polypeptides, or BZR polypeptides. The gene constructs may be inserted into vectors, which may be commercially available, suitable for transforming into plants and suitable for expression of the gene of interest in the transformed cells.

Optionally, one or more terminator sequences may be used in the construct introduced into a plant. Additional regulatory elements may include transcriptional as well as translational enhancers. Those skilled in the art will be aware of terminator and enhancer sequences that may be suitable for use in performing the invention. An intron sequence may also be added to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) or in the coding sequence to increase the amount of the mature message that accumulates in the cytosol, as described in the definitions section. Other control sequences (besides promoter, enhancer, silencer, intron sequences, 3'UTR and/or 5'UTR regions) may be protein and/or RNA stabilizing elements. Such sequences would be known or may readily be obtained by a person skilled in the art. The genetic constructs of the invention may further include an origin of replication sequence that is required for maintenance and/or replication in a specific cell type. One example is when a genetic construct is required to be maintained in a bacterial cell as an episomal genetic element (e.g. plasmid or cosmid molecule). Preferred origins of replication include, but are not limited to, the f 1 -ori and colE1. For the detection of the successful transfer of the nucleic acid sequences as used in the methods of the invention and/or selection of transgenic plants comprising these nucleic acids, it is advantageous to use marker genes (or reporter genes). Therefore, the genetic construct may optionally comprise a selectable marker gene. Selectable markers are described in more detail in the “definitions” section herein. The marker genes may be removed or excised from the transgenic cell once they are no longer needed. Techniques for marker removal are known in the art, useful techniques are described above in the definitions section. For the detection of the successful transfer of the nucleic acid sequences as used in the methods of the invention and/or selection of transgenic plants comprising these nucleic acids, it is advantageous to use marker genes (or reporter genes). Therefore, the genetic construct may optionally comprise a selectable marker gene. Selectable markers are described in more detail in the “definitions” section herein. The marker genes may be removed or excised from the transgenic cell once they are no longer needed. Techniques for marker removal are known in the art, useful techniques are described above in the definitions section. It is known that upon stable or transient integration of nucleic acid sequences into plant cells, only a minority of the cells takes up the foreign DNA and, if desired, integrates it into its genome, depending on the expression vector used and the transfection technique used. To identify and select these integrants, a gene coding for a selectable marker (such as the ones described above) is usually introduced into the host cells together with the gene of interest. These markers can for example be used in mutants in which these genes are not functional by, for example, deletion by conventional methods. Furthermore, nucleic acid sequence molecules encoding a selectable marker can be introduced into a host cell on the same vector that comprises the sequence encoding the polypeptides of the invention or used in the methods of the invention, or else in a separate vector. Cells which have been stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid sequence can be identified for example by selection (for example, cells which have integrated the selectable marker survive whereas the other cells die). The marker genes may be removed or excised from the transgenic cell once they are no longer needed. Techniques for marker gene removal are known in the art, useful techniques are described above in the definitions section. Concerning RHL1 polypeptides, or TRY-like polypeptides, the invention also provides a method for the production of transgenic plants having enhanced yield-related traits relative to control plants, comprising introduction and expression in a plant of any nucleic acid encoding a RHL1 polypeptide, or a TRY-like polypeptide, as defined hereinabove. Concerning TGase polypeptides, the invention also provides a method for the production of transgenic plants having increased seed yield-related traits relative to control plants, comprising introduction and expression in a plant of any nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide as defined hereinabove. Concerning BZR polypeptides, the invention also provides a method for the production of transgenic plants having increased seed yield relative to control plants, comprising introduction and expression in a plant of any nucleic acid encoding a BZR polypeptide as defined hereinabove. Concerning RHL1 polypeptides, more specifically, the present invention provides a method for the production of transgenic plants having increased enhanced yield-related traits, particularly increased (seed) yield, which method comprises: (i) introducing and expressing in a plant or plant cell a RHL1 polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid; and (ii) cultivating the plant cell under conditions promoting plant growth and development. The nucleic acid of (i) may be any of the nucleic acids capable of encoding a RHL1 polypeptide as defined herein. Concerning TGase polypeptides, more specifically, the present invention provides a method for the production of transgenic plants having increased seed yield-related traits relative to control plants, which method comprises: (i) introducing and expressing in a plant, plant part, or plant cell a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide; and (ii) cultivating the plant cell, plant part or plant under conditions promoting plant growth and development. The nucleic acid sequence of (i) may be any of the nucleic acid sequences capable of encoding a TGase polypeptide as defined herein. Concerning TRY-like polypeptides, more specifically, the present invention provides a method for the production of transgenic plants having enhanced yield-related traits, particularly increased early vigour and/or increased seed yield, which method comprises: (i) introducing and expressing in a plant or plant cell a TRY-like polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid; and (ii) cultivating the plant cell under conditions promoting plant growth and development. The nucleic acid of (i) may be any of the nucleic acids capable of encoding a TRY-like polypeptide as defined herein. Concerning BZR polypeptides, more specifically, the present invention provides a method for the production of transgenic plants having increased seed yield, which method comprises: (i) introducing and expressing in a plant or plant cell a BZR polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid; and (ii) cultivating the plant cell under conditions promoting plant growth and development. The nucleic acid of (i) may be any of the nucleic acids capable of encoding a BZR polypeptide as defined herein. The nucleic acid sequence may be introduced directly into a plant cell or into the plant itself (including introduction into a tissue, organ or any other part of a plant). According to a preferred feature of the present invention, the nucleic acid is preferably introduced into a plant by transformation. The term “transformation” is described in more detail in the “definitions” section herein. The genetically modified plant cells can be regenerated via all methods with which the skilled worker is familiar. Suitable methods can be found in the abovementioned publications by S.D. Kung and R. Wu, Potrykus or Hofgen and Willmitzer. Generally after transformation, plant cells or cell groupings are selected for the presence of one or more markers which are encoded by plant-expressible genes co-transferred with the gene of interest, following which the transformed material is regenerated into a whole plant. To select transformed plants, the plant material obtained in the transformation is, as a rule, subjected to selective conditions so that transformed plants can be distinguished from untransformed plants. For example, the seeds obtained in the above-described manner can be planted and, after an initial growing period, subjected to a suitable selection by spraying. A further possibility consists in growing the seeds, if appropriate after sterilization, on agar plates using a suitable selection agent so that only the transformed seeds can grow into plants. Alternatively, the transformed plants are screened for the presence of a selectable marker such as the ones described above. Following DNA transfer and regeneration, putatively transformed plants may also be evaluated, for instance using Southern analysis, for the presence of the gene of interest, copy number and/or genomic organisation. Alternatively or additionally, expression levels of the newly introduced DNA may be monitored using Northern and/or Western analysis, both techniques being well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. The generated transformed plants may be propagated by a variety of means, such as by clonal propagation or classical breeding techniques. For example, a first generation (or Τ1) transformed plant may be selfed and homozygous second-generation (or Τ2) transformants selected, and the Τ2 plants may then further be propagated through classical breeding techniques. The generated transformed organisms may take a variety of forms. For example, they may be chimeras of transformed cells and non-transformed cells; clonal transformants (e.g., all cells transformed to contain the expression cassette); grafts of transformed and untransformed tissues (e.g., in plants, a transformed rootstock grafted to an untransformed scion). The present invention clearly extends to any plant cell or plant produced by any of the methods described herein, and to all plant parts and propagules thereof. The present invention extends further to encompass the progeny of a primary transformed or transfected cell, tissue, organ or whole plant that has been produced by any of the aforementioned methods, the only requirement being that progeny exhibit the same genotypic and/or phenotypic characteristic(s) as those produced by the parent in the methods according to the invention. The invention also includes host cells containing an isolated nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide as defined hereinabove. Preferred host cells according to the invention are plant cells. Host plants for the nucleic acid sequences or the vector used in the method according to the invention, the expression cassette or construct or vector are, in principle, advantageously all plants, which are capable of synthesizing the polypeptides used in the inventive method. The methods of the invention are advantageously applicable to any plant. Plants that are particularly useful in the methods of the invention include all plants which belong to the superfamily Viridiplantae, in particular monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants including fodder or forage legumes, ornamental plants, food crops, trees or shrubs. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the plant is a crop plant. Examples of crop plants include soybean, sunflower, canola, alfalfa, rapeseed, linseed, cotton, tomato, potato and tobacco. Further preferably, the plant is a monocotyledonous plant. Examples of monocotyledonous plants include sugarcane. More preferably the plant is a cereal. Examples of cereals include rice, maize, wheat, barley, millet, rye, triticale, sorghum, emmer, spelt, secale, einkorn, teff, milo and oats. The invention also extends to harvestable parts of a plant such as, but not limited to seeds, leaves, fruits, flowers, stems, roots, rhizomes, tubers and bulbs, which harvestable parts comprise a recombinant nucleic acid encoding a BZR polypeptide. The invention furthermore relates to products derived, preferably directly derived, from a harvestable part of such a plant, such as dry pellets or powders, oil, fat and fatty acids, starch or proteins. According to a preferred feature of the invention, the modulated expression is increased expression. Methods for increasing expression of nucleic acids or genes, or gene products, are well documented in the art and examples are provided in the definitions section. Concerning RHL1 polypeptides, or TRY-like polypeptides, as mentioned above, a preferred method for modulating expression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a RHL1 polypeptide is by introducing and expressing in a plant a nucleic acid sequence encoding a RHL1 polypeptide, or a TRY-like polypeptide; however the effects of performing the method, i.e. enhancing yield-related traits may also be achieved using other well known techniques, including but not limited to T-DNA activation tagging, TILLING, homologous recombination. A description of these techniques is provided in the definitions section. Concerning TGase polypeptides, as mentioned above, a preferred method for increasing expression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide is by introducing and expressing in a plant a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide; however the effects of performing the method, i.e. increasing seed yield-related traits, may also be achieved using other well known techniques, including but not limited to T-DNA activation tagging, TILLING, homologous recombination. A description of these techniques is provided in the definitions section. Concerning BZR polypeptides, as mentioned above, a preferred method for modulating expression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a BZR polypeptide is by introducing and expressing in a plant a nucleic acid sequence encoding a BZR polypeptide; however the effects of performing the method, i.e. increasing seed yield may also be achieved using other well known techniques, including but not limited to T-DNA activation tagging, TILLING, homologous recombination. A description of these techniques is provided in the definitions section. The present invention also encompasses use of nucleic acid sequences encoding RHL1 polypeptides as described herein and use of these RHL1 polypeptides in enhancing any of the aforementioned yield-related traits in plants. Furthermore, the present invention also encompasses use of nucleic acid sequences encoding TGase polypeptides as described herein and use of these TGase polypeptides in increasing any of the aforementioned seed yield-related traits in plants, under normal growth conditions, under abiotic stress growth (preferably osmotic stress growth conditions) conditions, and under growth conditions of reduced nutrient availability, preferably under conditions of reduced nitrogen availability. Even furthrmore, the present invention also encompasses use of nucleic acids encoding TRY-like polypeptides as described herein and use of these TRY-like polypeptides in enhancing any of the aforementioned yield-related traits in plants. Furthermore, the present invention also encompasses use of nucleic acids encoding BZR polypeptides as described herein and use of these BZR polypeptides in increasing any of the aforementioned seed yield parameters in plants. Concerning RHL1 polypeptides, nucleic acid sequences encoding RHL1 polypeptide described herein, or the RHL1 polypeptides themselves, may find use in breeding programmes in which a DNA marker is identified which may be genetically linked to a RHL1 polypeptide-encoding gene. The nucleic acid sequences/genes, or the RHL1 polypeptides themselves may be used to define a molecular marker. This DNA or protein marker may then be used in breeding programmes to select plants having enhanced yield-related traits as defined hereinabove in the methods of the invention. Concerning TGase polypeptides, nucleic acid sequences encoding TGase polypeptides described herein, or the TGase polypeptides themselves, may find use in breeding programmes in which a DNA marker is identified that may be genetically linked to a TGase polypeptide-encoding gene. The genes/nucleic acid sequences, or the TGase polypeptides themselves may be used to define a molecular marker. This DNA or protein marker may then be used in breeding programmes to select plants having increased seed yield-related traits, as defined hereinabove in the methods of the invention. Concerning TRY-like polypeptides, nucleic acid sequences encoding TRY-like polypeptide described herein, or the TRY-like polypeptides themselves, may find use in breeding programmes in which a DNA marker is identified which may be genetically linked to a TRY-like polypeptide-encoding gene. The nucleic acid sequences/genes, or the TRY-like polypeptides themselves may be used to define a molecular marker. This DNA or protein marker may then be used in breeding programmes to select plants having enhanced yield-related traits as defined hereinabove in the methods of the invention. Concerning BZR polypeptides, nucleic acid sequences encoding BZR polypeptide described herein, or the BZR polypeptides themselves, may find use in breeding programmes in which a DNA marker is identified which may be genetically linked to a BZR polypeptide-encoding gene. The nucleic acid sequences/genes, or the BZR polypeptides themselves may be used to define a molecular marker. This DNA or protein marker may then be used in breeding programmes to select plants having increased seed yield as defined hereinabove in the methods of the invention. Allelic variants of a nucleic acid/gene encoding a RHL1 polypeptide, or a TGase polypeptide, or a TRY-like polypeptide, or a BZR polypeptide, may also find use in marker-assisted breeding programmes. Such breeding programmes sometimes require introduction of allelic variation by mutagenic treatment of the plants, using for example EMS mutagenesis; alternatively, the programme may start with a collection of allelic variants of so called “natural” origin caused unintentionally. Identification of allelic variants then takes place, for example, by PCR. This is followed by a step for selection of superior allelic variants of the sequence in question and which give increased yield. Selection is typically carried out by monitoring growth performance of plants containing different allelic variants of the sequence in question. Growth performance may be monitored in a greenhouse or in the field. Further optional steps include crossing plants in which the superior allelic variant was identified with another plant. This could be used, for example, to make a combination of interesting phenotypic features. Nucleic acid sequences encoding RHL1 polypeptides, or TGase polypeptides, or TRY-like polypeptides, or BZR polypeptides, may also be used as probes for genetically and physically mapping the genes that they are a part of, and as markers for traits linked to those genes. Such information may be useful in plant breeding in order to develop lines with desired phenotypes. Such use of nucleic acid sequences encoding a RHL1 polypeptide, or a TGase polypeptide, or a TRY-like polypeptide, or a BZR polypeptide, requires only a nucleic acid sequence of at least 15 nucleotides in length. The nucleic acid sequences encoding a RHL1 polypeptide, or a TGase polypeptide, or a TRY-like polypeptide, or a BZR polypeptide, may be used as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. Southern blots (Sambrook J, Fritsch EF and Maniatis Τ (1989) Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual) of restrictiondigested plant genomic DNA may be probed with the nucleic acid sequences encoding a RHL1 polypeptide, or a TGase polypeptide, or a TRY-like polypeptide, or a BZR polypeptide. The resulting banding patterns may then be subjected to genetic analyses using computer programs such as MapMaker (Lander et al. (1987) Genomics 1: 174-181) in order to construct a genetic map. In addition, the nucleic acid sequences may be used to probe Southern blots containing restriction endonuclease-treated genomic DNAs of a set of individuals representing parent and progeny of a defined genetic cross. Segregation of the DNA polymorphisms is noted and used to calculate the position of the nucleic acid sequence encoding a RHL1 polypeptide, or a TGase polypeptide, or a TRY-like polypeptide, or a BZR polypeptide, in the genetic map previously obtained using this population (Botstein et al. (1980) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 32: 314-331). The production and use of plant gene-derived probes for use in genetic mapping is described in Bernatzky and Tanksley (1986) Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter 4: 37-41. Numerous publications describe genetic mapping of specific cDNA clones using the methodology outlined above or variations thereof. For example, F2 intercross populations, backcross populations, randomly mated populations, near isogenic lines, and other sets of individuals may be used for mapping. Such methodologies are well known to those skilled in the art. The nucleic acid sequence probes may also be used for physical mapping (i.e., placement of sequences on physical maps; see Hoheisel et al. In: Non-mammalian Genomic Analysis: A Practical Guide, Academic press 1996, ρρ. 319-346, and references cited therein). In another embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence probes may be used in direct fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) mapping (Trask (1991) Trends Genet. 7:149-154). Although current methods of FISH mapping favour use of large clones (several kb to several hundred kb; see Laan et al. (1995) Genome Res. 5:13-20), improvements in sensitivity may allow performance of FISH mapping using shorter probes. A variety of nucleic acid sequence amplification-based methods for genetic and physical mapping may be carried out using the nucleic acid sequences. Examples include allelespecific amplification (Kazazian (1989) J. Lab. Clin. Med 11:95-96), polymorphism of PCRamplified fragments (CAPS; Sheffield et al. (1993) Genomics 16:325-332), allele-specific ligation (Landegren et al. (1988) Science 241:1077-1080), nucleotide extension reactions (Sokolov (1990) Nucleic acid sequence Res. 18:3671), Radiation Hybrid Mapping (Walter et al. (1997) Nat. Genet. 7:22-28) and Happy Mapping (Dear and Cook (1989) Nucleic acid sequence Res. 17:6795-6807). For these methods, the sequence of a nucleic acid sequence is used to design and produce primer pairs for use in the amplification reaction or in primer extension reactions. The design of such primers is well known to those skilled in the art. In methods employing PCR-based genetic mapping, it may be necessary to identify DNA sequence differences between the parents of the mapping cross in the region corresponding to the instant nucleic acid sequence. This, however, is generally not necessary for mapping methods. The methods according to the present invention result in plants having enhanced yield-related traits, as described hereinbefore. These traits may also be combined with other economically advantageous traits, such as further yield-enhancing traits, tolerance to other abiotic and biotic stresses, traits modifying various architectural features and/or biochemical and/or physiological features.

These traits may also be combined with other economically advantageous traits, such as further yield-increasing traits, tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, tolerance to herbicides, insectides, traits modifying various architectural features and/or biochemical and/or physiological features.

Examples The present invention will now be described with reference to the following examples, which are by way of illustration alone. The following examples are not intended to completely define or otherwise limit the scope of the invention. DNA manipulation: unless otherwise stated, recombinant DNA techniques are performed according to standard protocols described in (Sambrook (2001) Molecular Cloning: a laboratory manual, 3rd Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, CSH, New York) or in Volumes 1 and 2 of Ausubel et al. (1994), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Current Protocols. Standard materials and methods for plant molecular work are described in Plant Molecular Biology Labfax (1993) by R.D.D. Croy, published by BIOS Scientific Publications Ltd (UK) and Blackwell Scientific Publications (UK). Example 1: Identification of sequences related to the nucleic acid sequence used in the methods of the invention 1.1. Root Hairless 1 (RHL11 Sequences (full length cDNA, ESTs or genomic) related to the nucleic acid sequence used in the methods of the present invention were identified amongst those maintained in the Entrez Nucleotides database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using database sequence search tools, such as the Basic Local Alignment Tool (BLAST) (Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410; and Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402). The program is used to find regions of local similarity between sequences by comparing nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences to sequence databases and by calculating the statistical significance of matches. For example, the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid used in the present invention was used for the TBLASTN algorithm, with default settings and the filter to ignore low complexity sequences set off. The output of the analysis was viewed by pairwise comparison, and ranked according to the probability score (E-value), where the score reflect the probability that a particular alignment occurs by chance (the lower the Εvalue, the more significant the hit). In addition to E-values, comparisons were also scored by percentage identity. Percentage identity refers to the number of identical nucleotides (or amino acids) between the two compared nucleic acid (or polypeptide) sequences over a particular length. In some instances, the default parameters may be adjusted to modify the stringency of the search. For example the E-value may be increased to show less stringent matches. This way, short nearly exact matches may be identified. Table Α1 provides a list of nucleic acid sequences related to the nucleic acid sequence used in the methods of the present invention.

Further, access to proprietary databases, has allowed the identification of novel nucleic acid and polypeptide sequences. 1.4. BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 (BZR1) Sequences (full length cDNA, ESTs or genomic) related BZR nucleic acid sequence were identified amongst those maintained in the Entrez Nucleotides database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using database sequence search tools, such as the Basic Local Alignment Tool (BLAST) (Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410; and Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402). The program was used to find regions of local similarity between sequences by comparing nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences to sequence databases and by calculating the statistical significance of matches. SEQ ID NO: 2 was used for the TBLASTN algorithm, under default settings and without filters to ignore low complexity sequences. The output of the analysis was viewed by pairwise comparison, and ranked according to the probability score (E-value), where the score reflect the probability that a particular alignment occurs by chance (the lower the E-value, the more significant the hit). In addition to E-values, comparisons were also scored by percentage identity. Percentage identity refers to the number of identical nucleotides (or amino acids) between the two compared nucleic acid (or polypeptide) sequences over a particular length. Table Α4 provides a list of BZR nucleic acid sequences and encoded proteins thereof.

Root Hairless 1 (RHL1) Alignment of the RHL1 polypeptide sequences of Table A was performed using the Clustal W algorithm of progressive alignment (Larking et al. Bioinformatics. 2007 Nov 1;23(21):2947-8. Thompson et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res 25:4876-4882; Chenna et al. (2003). Nucleic Acids Res 31:3497-3500). Default values are for the gap open penalty of 10, for the gap extension penalty of 0,1 and the selected weight matrix is Blosum 62. Proteins alignment is given in Figure 2a. A phylogenetic tree the RHL1 polypeptide sequences of Table A (Figure 2b) was constructed using a neighbour-joining clustering algorithm as provided in the Clustal W programme. 2.2. Transglutaminases (TGases) Mutliple sequence alignment of all the TGase polypeptide sequences in Table A was performed using the AlignX algorithm (from Vector NTI 10.3, Invitrogen Corporation). Results of the alignment are shown in Figure 7 of the present application. The N-terminal plastidic transit peptide is separated from the rest of the polypeptide by a vertical bar. The putative calcium binding region is boxed, and marked with X’s under the consensus sequence. The domain where at least one coiled coil is predicted using the Coils algorithm (and as represented by SEQ ID NO: 70) is marked with X’s under the consensus region. 2.3. Tryptichon (TRY-like) Alignment of polypeptide sequences was performed using the ClustalW 2.0 algorithm of progressive alignment (Thompson et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res 25:4876-4882; Chenna et al. (2003). Nucleic Acids Res 31:3497-3500) with standard setting (slow alignment, similarity matrix: Gonnet, gap opening penalty 10, gap extension penalty: 0.2). Minor manual editing was done to further optimise the alignment. Sequence conservation among TRY-like polypeptides is essentially in the DNA binding domain of the polypeptides, the C-terminus and N-terminus usually being more variable in sequence length and composition. The TRY-like polypeptides are aligned in Figure 10. This alignment can be used for determining conserved signature sequences of about 5 to 10 amino acids in length. Preferably the conserved regions of the proteins are used, recognisable by the asterisks (identical residues), the colons (highly conserved substitutions) and the dots (conserved substitutions). 2.4. BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 (BZR1) Alignment of polypeptide sequences was performed using the AlignX programme from the Vector NTI (Invitrogen) which is based on the popular Clustal W algorithm of progressive alignment (Thompson et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res 25:4876-4882; Chenna et al. (2003). Nucleic Acids Res 31:3497-3500). Default values were as follows: gap open penalty of 10; gap extension penalty of 0,1; and the selected weight matrix was Blosum 62 (if polypeptides are aligned). The alignment of BZR polypeptides is shown in Figure 12. The sequence Ρρ172161 in the alignment is truncated in the Ν- and C- terminal. The highly conserved amino acid residues are indicated in the consensus sequence. Sequence conservation among BZR polypeptides is essentially in the N-terminal part along the BZR1, transcriptional repressor domain. The highly conserved bHLH-like DNA binding domain characteristic of BZR polypeptides is highlighted in Figure 12. Conserved amino acid motifs such as SAPVTPPLSSP (SEQ ID NO: 323: located at position 405-415 in the consensus sequence) and VKPWEGERIHE (SEQ ID NO: 324: located at position 634-644 in the consensus sequence) and DLELTLG (SEQ ID NO: 325: located at positions 656-662 in the consensus sequence) were identified. Example 3: Calculation of global percentage identity between polypeptide sequences useful in performing the methods of the invention 3.1. Root Hairless 1 (RHL1) Global percentages of similarity and identity between full length polypeptide sequences useful in performing the methods of the invention were determined using one of the methods available in the art, the MatGAT (Matrix Global Alignment Tool) software (BMC Bioinformatics. 2003 4:29. MatGAT: an application that generates similarity/identity matrices using protein or DNA sequences. Campanella JJ, Bitincka L, Smalley J; software hosted by Ledion Bitincka). MatGAT software generates similarity/identity matrices for DNA or protein sequences without needing pre-alignment of the data. The program performs a series of pair-wise alignments using the Myers and Miller global alignment algorithm (with a gap opening penalty of 12, and a gap extension penalty of 2), calculates similarity and identity using for example Blosum 62 (for polypeptides), and then places the results in a distance matrix. Sequence similarity is shown in the bottom half of the dividing line and sequence identity is shown in the top half of the diagonal dividing line. Parameters used in the comparison were: Scoring matrix:Blosum62 First Gap: 12 Extending gap:2 Results of the software analysis are shown in Table Β1 for the global similarity and identity over the full length of the polypeptide sequences. Percentage identity is given above the diagonal in bold and percentage similarity is given below the diagonal (normal face). The percentage identity between the RHL1 polypeptide sequences useful in performing the methods of the invention can be as low as 31 % amino acid identity compared to SEQ ID NO: 2. MatGAT results for global similarity and identity over the full length of the polypeptid sequences.

The percentage identity between the full length polypeptide sequences useful in performing the methods of the invention can be as low as 26% amino acid identity compared to SEQ ID NO: 44.

For example, when comparing the amino acid sequence of the coiled coil domain of SEQ ID NO: 2 (as represented by SEQ ID NO: 27), with the coiled coil domain of the polypeptides of Table A, the percentage amino acid identity increased up to 50%. 3.3. Tryptichon (TRY-like) Global percentages of similarity and identity between full length polypeptide sequences useful in performing the methods of the invention were determined using one of the methods available in the art, the MatGAT (Matrix Global Alignment Tool) software (BMC Bioinformatics. 2003 4:29.

Sequence similarity is shown in the bottom half of the dividing line and sequence identity is shown in the top half of the diagonal dividing line. Parameters used in the comparison were: Scoring matrix: Blosum62 First Gap: 12 Extending gap: 2 Results of the software analysis are shown in Table Β3 for the global similarity and identity over the full length of the polypeptide sequences. Percentage identity between At5g53200 and other TRY-like polypeptides is given above the diagonal in bold, for both the full length sequence and for the DNA-binding domain. The percentage identity between the TRY-like polypeptide sequences useful in performing the methods of the invention can be as low as 12 % sequence identity compared to SEQ ID NO: 76. However, the sequence conservation is much higher when the DNA binding is compared. Table Β2 shows similarity and identity among the sequences representing the DNA binding domain (sequences that align with the DNA-binding domain as shown in Figure 9 (residues 30 to 75 in SEQ ID NO: 76). The sequence identity is generally higher than 50%.

BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 (BZR1) Global percentages of similarity and identity between full length BZR polypeptide sequences were determined the MatGAT (Matrix Global Alignment Tool) software (BMC Bioinformatics. 2003 4:29. MatGAT: an application that generates similarity/identity matrices using protein or DNA sequences. Campanella JJ, Bitincka L, Smalley J; software hosted by Ledion Bitincka). MatGAT software generates similarity/identity matrices for DNA or protein sequences without needing pre-alignment of the data. The program performed a series of pair-wise alignments using the Myers and Miller global alignment algorithm (with a gap opening penalty of 12, and a gap extension penalty of 2) and calculated similarity and identity using for example Blosum 62 (for polypeptides), and then placed the results in a distance matrix. Sequence similarity is shown in the bottom half of the dividing line and sequence identity is shown in the top half of the diagonal dividing line. Parameters used in the comparison were: Scoring matrix: Blosum62 First Gap: 12 Extending gap: 2 Results of the software analysis are shown in Table Β for the global similarity and identity over the full length of the polypeptide sequences. Percentage identity is given above the diagonal in bold and percentage similarity is given below the diagonal (normal face). The percentage identity between the BZR polypeptide sequences of table Β4 compared to SEQ ID NO: 239 ranges from 22.5% to 88.2 %.

Database Accession number Accession name Ε value Amino acid coordinates on SEQ ID NO: 239 Example 5: Prediction of secondary structure features ofTGase Coiled coils usually contain a repeated seven amino acid residue pattern called a heptad repeat. Coiled coils are important to identify for protein-protein interactions, such as oligomerization, either of identical proteins, of proteins of the same family, or of unrelated proteins. Recently much progress has been made in computational prediction of coiled coils from sequence data. Many algorithms well known to a person skilled in the art are available at the ExPASy Proteomics tools. One of them, COILS, is a program that compares a sequence to a database of known parallel two-stranded coiled-coils and derives a similarity score. By comparing this score to the distribution of scores in globular and coiled-coil proteins, the program then calculates the probability that the sequence will adopt a coiled-coil conformation. The TGase polypeptide as represented by SEQ ID NO: 45, has at least one predicted coiled coil domain, with a high probability, in all three windows (14, 21 and 28) examined. In Table D1, the residue coordinates, residues, the three windows and corresponding probability values are shown. In Figure 6, is the graphical output of the COILS algorithm on the polypeptide as represented by SEQ ID NO: 45, where at least one predicted coiled coil is clearly visible, in all three windows (as represented by the three lines).

Transglutaminases (TGases) Many algorithms can be used to perform prediction of the subcellular localisation of polypeptides, including: • TargetP 1.1 hosted on the server of the Technical University of Denmark; • ChloroP 1.1 hosted on the server of the Technical University of Denmark; • Protein Prowler Subcellular Localisation Predictor version 1.2 hosted on the server of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; • PENCE Proteome Analyst PA-GOSUB 2.5 hosted on the server of the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; • ΤΜΗΜΜ, hosted on the server of the Technical University of Denmark By comparing the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 45 with orthologs from other plant species for which subcellular localisation was identified, it is possible to deduce that the subcellular localization of the polypeptide sequence as represented by SEQ ID NO: 45 is the chloroplast (Villalobos etal. (2004) Gene 336: 93-104). 6.2. Tryptichon (TRY-like) TargetP 1.1 predicts the subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins. The location assignment is based on the predicted presence of any of the N-terminal pre-sequences: chloroplast transit peptide (cTP), mitochondrial targeting peptide (mTP) or secretory pathway signal peptide (SP). Scores on which the final prediction is based are not really probabilities, and they do not necessarily add to one. However, the location with the highest score is the most likely according to TargetP, and the relationship between the scores (the reliability class) may be an indication of how certain the prediction is. The reliability class (RC) ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the strongest prediction. TargetP is maintained at the server of the Technical University of Denmark. For the sequences predicted to contain an N-terminal presequence a potential cleavage site can also be predicted. A number of parameters were selected, such as organism group (non-plant or plant), cutoff sets (none, predefined set of cutoffs, or user-specified set of cutoffs), and the calculation of prediction of cleavage sites (yes or no). The results of TargetP 1.1 analysis of the polypeptide sequence as represented by SEQ ID NO: 76 are presented Table Ε1. The “plant” organism group has been selected, no cutoffs defined, and the predicted length of the transit peptide requested. The subcellular localization of the polypeptide sequence as represented by SEQ ID NO: 76 may be the cytoplasm or nucleus, no transit peptide is predicted.

Example 7: Assay related to the polypeptide sequences useful in performing the methods of the invention 7.1. Functional assay of Root Hairless 1 (RHL1) The binding of an RHL1 polypeptide is assayed in an in vitro assay essentially as described by Sugimoto-Shirasu et al. 2005 PNAS vol. 102 _ no. 51, 18736-18741. Briefly, Recombinant RHL1 Pprotein is produced in a bacterial system and purified using standard methods. Purified RHL1 protein is incubated with DNa fragments and binding of the RHL1 protein the DNA fragment is detected using plasmon resonance (SPR). 1.2. Transglutaminases (TGases) Polypeptides useful in performing the methods of the invention typically catalyze the formation of amide linkages, generally in a Ca-dependent fashion, between the primary amine of an amine donor substrate and the y-carboxamide group of peptide-bound endo-glutamine residues in proteins or polypeptides that are the amine acceptors. More specifically, TGase activity can be measured using the radiolabeled putrescine method, or the gamma-glutamyl biotin cadaverine method, as described in Villalobos et al. (2004; supra). A person skilled in the art is well aware of such experimental procedures to measure TGase polypeptide enzymatic activity, including the activity of a TGase polypeptide as represented by SEQ ID NO: 45. 7.3. Functional assay ofTryptichon (TRY-like) TRY-like polypeptides typically have DNA-binding activity. One method for measuring and characterising DNA-binding properties of polypeptides is described in Xue (A CELD-fusion method for rapid determination of the DNA-binding sequence specificity of novel plant DNA-binding proteins. Plant Journal 41,638-649, 2005). Example 8: Cloning of the nucleic acid sequence used in the methods of the invention 8.1. Root Hairless 1 (RHL1) The nucleic acid sequence used in the methods of the invention was amplified by PCR using as template a custom-made Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings cDNA library (in pCMV Sport 6.0; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). PCR was performed using Hifi Taq DNA polymerase in standard conditions, using 200 ng of template in a 50 μΐ PCR mix. The primers used were: 5’ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggcttaaacaatggtacgagcttcatcgtc-3’ (SEQ ID NO: 40; sense) and 5’-ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtttctggaaaagatttct ttaagc-3’ (SEQ ID NO: 41 ; reverse) which include the AttB sites for Gateway recombination. The amplified PCR fragment was purified also using standard methods. The first step of the Gateway procedure, the BP reaction, was then performed, during which the PCR fragment recombines in vivo with the pDONR201 plasmid to produce, according to the Gateway terminology, an “entry clone”, pArath_RHL1. Plasmid pDONR201 was purchased from Invitrogen, as part of the Gateway® technology. The entry clone comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 was then used in an LR reaction with a destination vector used for Oryza sativa transformation. This vector contained as functional elements within the T-DNA borders: a plant selectable marker; a screenable marker expression cassette; and a Gateway cassette intended for LR in vivo recombination with the nucleic acid sequence of interest already cloned in the entry clone. A rice GOS2 promoter (SEQ ID NO: 42) for root specific expression was located upstream of this Gateway cassette. After the LR recombination step, the resulting expression vector pGOS2::Arath_RHL1l (Figure 3) was transformed into Agrobacterium strain LBA4044 according to methods well known in the art. 8.2. Transglutaminases (TGases) The Oryza sativa nucleic acid sequence encoding a TGase polypeptide sequence as represented by SEQ ID NO: 45 was amplified by PCR using as template a cDNA bank constructed using RNA from rice plants at different developmental stages. The following primers, which include the AttB sites for Gateway recombination, were used for PCR amplification: prm02265 (SEQ ID NO: 73, sense): 5’-ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaa gcaggcttcacaatggcataccatggacag-3’ and prm02266 (SEQ ID NO: 74, reverse, complementary): 5’-ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtatttcacctctggcctg-3’. PCR was performed using Hifi Taq DNA polymerase in standard conditions. A PCR fragment of the expected length (including attB sites) was amplified and purified also using standard methods. The first step of the Gateway procedure, the BP reaction, was then performed, during which the PCR fragment recombined in vivo with the pDONR201 plasmid to produce, according to the Gateway terminology, an “entry clone”. Plasmid pDONR201 was purchased from Invitrogen, as part of the Gateway® technology. The entry clone comprising SEQ ID NO: 44 was subsequently used in an LR reaction with a destination vector used for Oryza sativa transformation. This vector contained as functional elements within the T-DNA borders: a plant selectable marker; a screenable marker expression cassette; and a Gateway cassette intended for LR in vivo recombination with the nucleic acid sequence of interest already cloned in the entry clone. A rice alpha-globulin promoter (SEQ ID NO: 72) for seed-specific expression was located upstream of this Gateway cassette. After the LR recombination step, the resulting expression vector pGlob::TGase (Figure 4) for seed-specific expression, was transformed into Agrobacterium strain LBA4044 according to methods well known in the art. 8.3. Tryptichon (TRY-like) The nucleic acid sequence used in the methods of the invention was amplified by PCR using as template a custom-made Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings cDNA library (in pCMV Sport 6.0; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). PCR was performed using Hifi Taq DNA polymerase in standard conditions, using 200 ng of template in a 50 μΐ PCR mix. The primers used were prm09014 (SEQ ID NO: 233; sense, start codon in bold): 5’-ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcagg cttaaacaatggataacactgaccgtcgt-3’ and prm09015 (SEQ ID NO: 234; reverse, complementary): 5’-ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggttttttcgttggcttaaaaa ca-3’, which include the AttB sites for Gateway recombination. The amplified PCR fragment was purified also using standard methods. The first step of the Gateway procedure, the BP reaction, was then performed, during which the PCR fragment recombines in vivo with the pDONR201 plasmid to produce, according to the Gateway terminology, an “entry clone”, pTRY-like. Plasmid pDONR201 was purchased from Invitrogen, as part of the Gateway® technology. The entry clone comprising SEQ ID NO: 75 was then used in an LR reaction with a destination vector used for Oryza sativa transformation. This vector contained as functional elements within the T-DNA borders: a plant selectable marker; a screenable marker expression cassette; and a Gateway cassette intended for LR in vivo recombination with the nucleic acid sequence of interest already cloned in the entry clone. A rice GOS2 promoter (SEQ ID NO: 237) for constitutive specific expression was located upstream of this Gateway cassette. In an alternative embodiment, a root specific promoter (RCc3 promoter; SEQ ID NO: 235) After the LR recombination step, the resulting expression vector pGOS2::TRY-like (Figure 3) or pRCc3::TRY was transformed into Agrobacterium strain LBA4044 according to methods well known in the art. 8.4. BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 (BZR1) The nucleic acid sequence used in the methods of the invention was amplified by PCR using as template a custom-made Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings cDNA library (in pCMV Sport 6.0; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). PCR was performed using Hifi Taq DNA polymerase in standard conditions, using 200 ng of template in a 50 μΐ PCR mix. The primers used were (SEQ ID NO: 320; sense): 5’-ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggcttaaacaatgacggcatcaggag ga-3’ and (SEQ ID NO: 321; reverse, complementary): 5’-ggggaccactttgtacaag aaagctgggtaccacgatattaacctagccg-3’, which include the AttB sites for Gateway recombination. The amplified PCR fragment was purified also using standard methods. The first step of the Gateway procedure, the BP reaction, was then performed, during which the PCR fragment recombined in vivo with the pDONR201 plasmid to produce, according to the Gateway terminology, an “entry clone”, pBZR. Plasmid pDONR201 was purchased from Invitrogen, as part of the Gateway® technology. The entry clone comprising SEQ ID NO: 238 was then used in an LR reaction with a destination vector used for Oryza sativa transformation. This vector contained as functional elements within the T-DNA borders: a plant selectable marker; a screenable marker expression cassette; and a Gateway cassette intended for LR in vivo recombination with the nucleic acid sequence of interest already cloned in the entry clone. A rice GOS2 promoter (SEQ ID NO: 322) for constitutive specific expression was located upstream of this Gateway cassette. After the LR recombination step, the resulting expression vector pGOS2::BZR (Figure 3) was transformed into Agrobacterium strain LBA4044 according to methods well known in the art. Example 9: Plant transformation Rice transformation The Agrobacterium containing the expression vector was used to transform Oryza sativa plants. Mature dry seeds of the rice japonica cultivar Nipponbare were dehusked. Sterilization was carried out by incubating for one minute in 70% ethanol, followed by 30 minutes in 0.2% HgCI2, followed by a 6 times 15 minutes wash with sterile distilled water. The sterile seeds were then germinated on a medium containing 2,4-D (callus induction medium). After incubation in the dark for four weeks, embryogenic, scutellum-derived calli were excised and propagated on the same medium. After two weeks, the calli were multiplied or propagated by subculture on the same medium for another 2 weeks. Embryogenic callus pieces were subcultured on fresh medium 3 days before co-cultivation (to boost cell division activity). Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 containing the expression vector was used for co-cultivation. Agrobacterium was inoculated on ΑΒ medium with the appropriate antibiotics and cultured for 3 days at 28°C. The bacteria were then collected and suspended in liquid co-cultivation medium to a density (OD6oo) of about 1. The suspension was then transferred to a Petri dish and the calli immersed in the suspension for 15 minutes. The callus tissues were then blotted dry on a filter paper and transferred to solidified, co-cultivation medium and incubated for 3 days in the dark at 25°C. Co-cultivated calli were grown on 2,4-D-containing medium for 4 weeks in the dark at 28°C in the presence of a selection agent. During this period, rapidly growing resistant callus islands developed. After transfer of this material to a regeneration medium and incubation in the light, the embryogenic potential was released and shoots developed in the next four to five weeks. Shoots were excised from the calli and incubated for 2 to 3 weeks on an auxin-containing medium from which they were transferred to soil. Hardened shoots were grown under high humidity and short days in a greenhouse. Approximately 35 independent TO rice transformants were generated for one construct. The primary transformants were transferred from a tissue culture chamber to a greenhouse. After a quantitative PCR analysis to verify copy number of the T-DNA insert, only single copy transgenic plants that exhibit tolerance to the selection agent were kept for harvest of Τ1 seed. Seeds were then harvested three to five months after transplanting. The method yielded single locus transformants at a rate of over 50 % (Aldemita and Hodges'! 996, Chan et al. 1993, Hiei etal. 1994). Com transformation Transformation of maize (Zea mays) is performed with a modification of the method described by Ishida et al. (1996) Nature Biotech 14(6): 745-50. Transformation is genotype-dependent in corn and only specific genotypes are amenable to transformation and regeneration. The inbred line Α188 (University of Minnesota) or hybrids with Α188 as a parent are good sources of donor material for transformation, but other genotypes can be used successfully as well. Ears are harvested from corn plant approximately 11 days after pollination (DAP) when the length of the immature embryo is about 1 to 1.2 mm. Immature embryos are cocultivated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing the expression vector, and transgenic plants are recovered through organogenesis. Excised embryos are grown on callus induction medium, then maize regeneration medium, containing the selection agent (for example imidazolinone but various selection markers can be used). The Petri plates are incubated in the light at 25 °C for 2-3 weeks, or until shoots develop. The green shoots are transferred from each embryo to maize rooting medium and incubated at 25 °C for 2-3 weeks, until roots develop. The rooted shoots are transplanted to soil in the greenhouse. Τ1 seeds are produced from plants that exhibit tolerance to the selection agent and that contain a single copy of the T-DNA insert. Wheat transformation Transformation of wheat is performed with the method described by Ishida et al. (1996) Nature Biotech 14(6): 745-50. The cultivar Bobwhite (available from CIMMYT, Mexico) is commonly used in transformation. Immature embryos are co-cultivated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing the expression vector, and transgenic plants are recovered through organogenesis. After incubation with Agrobacterium, the embryos are grown in vitro on callus induction medium, then regeneration medium, containing the selection agent (for example imidazolinone but various selection markers can be used). The Petri plates are incubated in the light at 25 °C for 2-3 weeks, or until shoots develop. The green shoots are transferred from each embryo to rooting medium and incubated at 25 °C for 2-3 weeks, until roots develop. The rooted shoots are transplanted to soil in the greenhouse. Τ1 seeds are produced from plants that exhibit tolerance to the selection agent and that contain a single copy of the T-DNA insert. Soybean transformation Soybean is transformed according to a modification of the method described in the Texas A&M patent US 5,164,310. Several commercial soybean varieties are amenable to transformation by this method. The cultivar Jack (available from the Illinois Seed foundation) is commonly used for transformation. Soybean seeds are sterilised for in vitro sowing. The hypocotyl, the radicle and one cotyledon are excised from seven-day old young seedlings. The epicotyl and the remaining cotyledon are further grown to develop axillary nodes. These axillary nodes are excised and incubated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing the expression vector. After the cocultivation treatment, the explants are washed and transferred to selection media. Regenerated shoots are excised and placed on a shoot elongation medium. Shoots no longer than 1 cm are placed on rooting medium until roots develop. The rooted shoots are transplanted to soil in the greenhouse. Τ1 seeds are produced from plants that exhibit tolerance to the selection agent and that contain a single copy of the T-DNA insert. Rapeseed/canola transformation Cotyledonary petioles and hypocotyls of 5-6 day old young seedling are used as explants for tissue culture and transformed according to Babic et al. (1998, Plant Cell Rep 17: 183-188). The commercial cultivar Westar (Agriculture Canada) is the standard variety used for transformation, but other varieties can also be used. Canola seeds are surface-sterilized for in vitro sowing. The cotyledon petiole explants with the cotyledon attached are excised from the in vitro seedlings, and inoculated with Agrobacterium (containing the expression vector) by dipping the cut end of the petiole explant into the bacterial suspension. The explants are then cultured for 2 days on MSBAP-3 medium containing 3 mg/I BAP, 3 % sucrose, 0.7 % Phytagar at 23 °C, 16 hr light. After two days of co-cultivation with Agrobacterium, the petiole explants are transferred to MSBAP-3 medium containing 3 mg/I BAP, cefotaxime, carbenicillin, or timentin (300 mg/I) for 7 days, and then cultured on MSBAP-3 medium with cefotaxime, carbenicillin, or timentin and selection agent until shoot regeneration. When the shoots are 5 10 mm in length, they are cut and transferred to shoot elongation medium (MSBAP-0.5, containing 0.5 mg/I BAP). Shoots of about 2 cm in length are transferred to the rooting medium (MS0) for root induction. The rooted shoots are transplanted to soil in the greenhouse. Τ1 seeds are produced from plants that exhibit tolerance to the selection agent and that contain a single copy of the T-DNA insert. Alfalfa transformation A regenerating clone of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is transformed using the method of (McKersie et al., 1999 Plant Physiol 119: 839-847). Regeneration and transformation of alfalfa is genotype dependent and therefore a regenerating plant is required. Methods to obtain regenerating plants have been described. For example, these can be selected from the cultivar Rangelander (Agriculture Canada) or any other commercial alfalfa variety as described by Brown DCW and A Atanassov (1985. Plant Cell Tissue Organ Culture 4: 111-112). Alternatively, the RA3 variety (University of Wisconsin) has been selected for use in tissue culture (Walker et al., 1978 Am J Bot 65:654-659). Petiole explants are cocultivated with an overnight culture of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 ρΜΡ90 (McKersie et al., 1999 Plant Physiol 119: 839-847) or LBA4404 containing the expression vector. The explants are cocultivated for 3 d in the dark on SH induction medium containing 288 mg/ L Pro, 53 mg/ L thioproline, 4.35 g/ L K2S04, and 100 pm acetosyringinone. The explants are washed in half-strength Murashige-Skoog medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) and plated on the same SH induction medium without acetosyringinone but with a suitable selection agent and suitable antibiotic to inhibit Agrobacterium growth. After several weeks, somatic embryos are transferred to BOi2Y development medium containing no growth regulators, no antibiotics, and 50 g/ L sucrose. Somatic embryos are subsequently germinated on half-strength Murashige-Skoog medium. Rooted seedlings were transplanted into pots and grown in a greenhouse. Τ1 seeds are produced from plants that exhibit tolerance to the selection agent and that contain a single copy of the T-DNA insert. Cotton transformation Cotton is transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens according to the method described in US 5,159,135. Cotton seeds are surface sterilised in 3% sodium hypochlorite solution during 20 minutes and washed in distilled water with 500 pg/ml cefotaxime. The seeds are then transferred to SH-medium with 50pg/ml benomyl for germination. Hypocotyls of 4 to 6 days old seedlings are removed, cut into 0.5 cm pieces and are placed on 0.8% agar. An Agrobacterium suspension (approx. 108 cells per ml, diluted from an overnight culture transformed with the gene of interest and suitable selection markers) is used for inoculation of the hypocotyl explants. After 3 days at room temperature and lighting, the tissues are transferred to a solid medium (1.6 g/l Gelrite) with Murashige and Skoog salts with Β5 vitamins (Gamborg et al., Exp. Cell Res. 50:151-158 (1968)), 0.1 mg/I 2,4-D, 0.1 mg/I 6-furfurylaminopurine and 750 pg/ml MgCL2, and with 50 to 100 pg/ml cefotaxime and 400-500 pg/ml carbenicillin to kill residual bacteria. Individual cell lines are isolated after two to three months (with subcultures every four to six weeks) and are further cultivated on selective medium for tissue amplification (30°C, 16 hr photoperiod). Transformed tissues are subsequently further cultivated on non-selective medium during 2 to 3 months to give rise to somatic embryos. Healthy looking embryos of at least 4 mm length are transferred to tubes with SH medium in fine vermiculite, supplemented with 0.1 mg/I indole acetic acid, 6 furfurylaminopurine and gibberellic acid. The embryos are cultivated at 30°C with a photoperiod of 16 hrs, and plantlets at the 2 to 3 leaf stage are transferred to pots with vermiculite and nutrients. The plants are hardened and subsequently moved to the greenhouse for further cultivation. Example 10: Phenotypic evaluation procedure 10.1 Evaluation setup Approximately 35 independent TO rice transformants were generated. The primary transformants were transferred from a tissue culture chamber to a greenhouse for growing and harvest of Τ1 seed. Six events, of which the Τ1 progeny segregated 3:1 for presence/absence of the transgene, were retained. For each of these events, approximately 10 Τ1 seedlings containing the transgene (hetero- and homo-zygotes) and approximately 10 Τ1 seedlings lacking the transgene (nullizygotes) were selected by monitoring visual marker expression. The transgenic plants and the corresponding nullizygotes were grown side-by-side at random positions. Greenhouse conditions were of shorts days (12 hours light), 28°C in the light and 22°C in the dark, and a relative humidity of 70%. Plants grown under non-stress conditions are watered at regular intervals to ensure that water and nutrients are not limiting to satisfy plant needs to complete growth and development. Four Τ1 events were further evaluated in the Τ2 generation following the same evaluation procedure as for the Τ1 generation but with more individuals per event. From the stage of sowing until the stage of maturity the plants were passed several times through a digital imaging cabinet. At each time point digital images (2048x1536 pixels, 16 million colours) were taken of each plant from at least 6 different angles. Drought screen Plants from Τ2 seeds are grown in potting soil under normal conditions until they approached the heading stage. They were then transferred to a "dry" section where irrigation was withheld. Humidity probes were inserted in randomly chosen pots to monitor the soil water content (SWC). When SWC went below certain thresholds, the plants were automatically re-watered continuously until a normal level was reached again. The plants were then re-transferred again to normal conditions. The rest of the cultivation (plant maturation, seed harvest) was the same as for plants not grown under abiotic stress conditions. Growth and yield parameters are recorded as detailed for growth under normal conditions. Nitrogen use efficiency screen Rice plants from Τ2 seeds were grown in potting soil under normal conditions except for the nutrient solution. The pots were watered from transplantation to maturation with a specific nutrient solution containing reduced Ν nitrogen (Ν) content, usually between 7 to 8 times less. The rest of the cultivation (plant maturation, seed harvest) was the same as for plants not grown under abiotic stress. Growth and yield parameters are recorded as detailed for growth under normal conditions. Salt stress screen Plants are grown on a substrate made of coco fibers and argex (3 to 1 ratio). A normal nutrient solution was used during the first two weeks after transplanting the plantlets in the greenhouse. After the first two weeks, 25 mM of salt (NaCI) was added to the nutrient solution, until the plants were harvested. Seed-related parameters were then measured. 10.2 Statistical analysis: F test A two factor ANOVA (analysis of variants) was used as a statistical model for the overall evaluation of plant phenotypic characteristics. An F test was carried out on all the parameters measured of all the plants of all the events transformed with the gene of the present invention. The F test was carried out to check for an effect of the gene over all the transformation events and to verify for an overall effect of the gene, also known as a global gene effect. The threshold for significance for a true global gene effect was set at a 5% probability level for the F test. A significant F test value points to a gene effect, meaning that it is not only the mere presence or position of the gene that is causing the differences in phenotype. Because two experiments with overlapping events were carried out, a combined analysis was performed. This is useful to check consistency of the effects over the two experiments, and if this is the case, to accumulate evidence from both experiments in order to increase confidence in the conclusion. The method used was a mixed-model approach that takes into account the multilevel structure of the data (i.e. experiment - event - segregants). Ρ values were obtained by comparing likelihood ratio test to chi square distributions. 10.3 Parameters measured Biomass-related parameter measurement From the stage of sowing until the stage of maturity the plants were passed several times through a digital imaging cabinet. At each time point digital images (2048x1536 pixels, 16 million colours) were taken of each plant from at least 6 different angles. The plant aboveground area (or leafy biomass) was determined by counting the total number of pixels on the digital images from aboveground plant parts discriminated from the background. This value was averaged for the pictures taken on the same time point from the different angles and was converted to a physical surface value expressed in square mm by calibration. Experiments show that the aboveground plant area measured this way correlates with the biomass of plant parts above ground. The above ground area is the area measured at the time point at which the plant had reached its maximal leafy biomass. The early vigour is the plant (seedling) aboveground area three weeks post-germination. Increase in root biomass is expressed as an increase in total root biomass (measured as maximum biomass of roots observed during the lifespan of a plant); or as an increase in the root/shoot index (measured as the ratio between root mass and shoot mass in the period of active growth of root and shoot). Early vigour was determined by counting the total number of pixels from aboveground plant parts discriminated from the background. This value was averaged for the pictures taken on the same time point from different angles and was converted to a physical surface value expressed in square mm by calibration. The results described below are for plants three weeks post-germination. Seed-related parameter measurements The mature primary panicles were harvested, counted, bagged, barcode-labelled and then dried for three days in an oven at 37°C. The panicles were then threshed and all the seeds were collected and counted. The filled husks were separated from the empty ones using an air-blowing device. The empty husks were discarded and the remaining fraction was counted again. The filled husks were weighed on an analytical balance. The number of filled seeds was determined by counting the number of filled husks that remained after the separation step. The total seed yield was measured by weighing all filled husks harvested from a plant. Total seed number per plant was measured by counting the number of husks harvested from a plant. Thousand Kernel Weight (TKW) is extrapolated from the number of filled seeds counted and their total weight. The Harvest Index (HI) in the present invention is defined as the ratio between the total seed yield and the above ground area (mm2), multiplied by a factor 106. The total number of flowers per panicle as defined in the present invention is the ratio between the total number of seeds and the number of mature primary panicles. The seed fill rate as defined in the present invention is the proportion (expressed as a %) of the number of filled seeds over the total number of seeds (or florets). Example 11: Results of the phenotypic evaluation of the transgenic plants 11.1.

Tryptichon (TRY-like) The evaluation of transgenic rice plants expressing a TRY-like nucleic acid under control of the RCc3 promoter, and grown under conditions of reduced nitrogen availability, revealed an increase of more than 5 % for emergence vigour (early vigour), fill rate, harvest index, and total seed yield. These increases were observed in Τ1 generation plants as well as in Τ2 generation plants.
