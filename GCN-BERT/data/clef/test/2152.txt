Method E (Di- and Tri-Fluoromethylation at C-6 after Cyclization)
Example 10: 6-(difluoromethyl)-8-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-{[1-(methylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino}pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one
A solution of zinc difluoromethanesulfinate (3.34 g, 11.4 mmol) and iron (II) chloride (377 mg, 1.90 mmol) in water (10 mL) was added portionwise to a solution of 8-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-{[1-(methylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino}pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (Example 2, 1.60 g, 3.80 mmol) and TFA (0.290 mL, 3.80 mmol) in DMSO (60 mL) at room temperature. The resulting mixture was treated with TBHP (70 wt % solution in water, 0.400 mL, 342 mg, 3.80 mmol), causing a slight increase in internal temperature to 32° C. Stirring was continued at room temperature for 19 h, at which time LCMS showed ˜30% conversion. A second portion of TBHP solution (0.400 mL, 342 mg, 3.80 mmol was added and stirring continued for 3 h. A third portion of TBHP solution (0.400 mL, 342 mg, 3.80 mmol) was added and stirring continued at room temperature for 45 min, at which time LCMS showed ˜50% conversion. More zinc difluoromethanesulfinate (1.1 g, 3.7 mmol) and TBHP solution (0.400 mL, 342 mg, 3.80 mmol) were added, and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 20 h. At this time, LCMS showed ˜90% conversion. The reaction solution was poured into a mixture of 10% aq sodium EDTA/ice, and extracted with EtOAc (50 mL). The aqueous layer was saturated with NaCl, and extracted further with EtOAc (50 mL×3). The combined organics were washed with dilute aq sodium EDTA (50 mL) and sat. aq NaCl (50 mL). The deep blue organic layer was treated with activated charcoal and sodium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The residue (1.49 g foam) was purified by preparative SFC (Diol/Monol column with MeOH/CO2) to give 6-(difluoromethyl)-8-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-{[1-(methyl-sulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino}pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (Example 10, 568 mg, 32%) as a white solid.
