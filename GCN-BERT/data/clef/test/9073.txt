Step 2: Preparation of WX23
To 2-[3-[4-(2-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-8-yl)pyrazole-1-yl]-1-cyclopropylsulfonyl-azetidine-3-yl]acetonitrile(50 mg, 125.5 umol) and triethylamine (38 g, 376.5 umol) dissolved in DCM(5 mL), was added dropwise trifluoroacetic anhydride(79 mg, 376.5 umol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 26°C for reacting for 12 hours. After LC-MS showed that the reaction was completed, H2O (5 mL) was added and the organic layer was separated, the water layer was extracted with DCM(2×15 mL) twice. The organic phase was combined, washed with saturated salt water(15 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure to remove the filtrate. The residue was purified through preparative HPLC(alkalinity, 0-60) to give (WX23)(17 mg, 27.4% yield).
