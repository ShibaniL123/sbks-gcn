TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates generally to orthopaedic instruments for use in the performance of an orthopaedic joint replacement procedure, and more particularly to orthopaedic surgical instruments for use in the performance of a revision knee replacement procedure. BACKGROUND Joint arthroplasty is a well-known surgical procedure by which a diseased and/or damaged natural joint is replaced by a prosthetic joint. For example, in a total knee arthroplasty surgical procedure, a patient's natural knee joint is partially or totally replaced by a prosthetic knee joint or knee prosthesis. A typical knee prosthesis includes a tibial tray, a femoral component, and a polymer insert or bearing positioned between the tibial tray and the femoral component. The tibial tray generally includes a plate having a stem extending distally therefrom, and the femoral component generally includes a pair of spaced apart condylar elements, which include surfaces that articulate with corresponding surfaces of the polymer bearing. The stem of the tibial tray is configured to be implanted in a surgically-prepared medullary canal of the patient's tibia, and the femoral component is configured to be coupled to a surgically-prepared distal end of a patient's femur From time-to-time, a revision knee surgery may need to be performed on a patient. In such a revision knee surgery, the previously-implanted knee prosthesis is surgically removed and a replacement knee prosthesis is implanted. In some revision knee surgeries, all of the components of the previously-implanted knee prosthesis, including, for example, the tibial tray, the femoral component, and the polymer bearing, may be surgically removed. In other revision knee surgeries, only part of the previously-implanted knee prosthesis may be removed and replaced. During a revision knee surgery, the orthopaedic surgeon typically uses a variety of different orthopaedic surgical instruments such as, for example, cutting blocks, reamers, drill guides, prosthetic trials, and other surgical instruments to prepare the patient's bones to receive the knee prosthesis.

The instrument assembly 10 also includes a cover 28, which may be positioned over the mounting brackets 24 of the base cutting block 12 when none of the modular cutting blocks 14 are secured to the base cutting block 12. As shown in FIG. 1, the instrument assembly 10 also includes an intramedullary adaptor 30 configured to be coupled to the base cutting block 12. What is meant herein by the term “intramedullary adaptor” is a surgical tool configured to be secured to an intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument and including an end sized and shaped to be positioned in a medullary canal of a patient's femur during the orthopaedic surgical procedure. What is meant herein by the term “intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument” is a surgical tool configured to be positioned in the medullary canal of the patient's femur during the orthopaedic surgical procedure. Examples of intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instruments include femoral stem trials, femoral broaches, and the like. The instrument assembly 10 includes a locking mechanism 32 that secures the intramedullary adaptor 30 to the base cutting block 12, as described in greater detail below. Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the base cutting block 12 includes a base plate 40 and a pair of arms 42 extending from the base plate 40. The base plate 40 and the arms 42 of the base cutting block 12 are formed from a metallic material, such as, for example, a stainless steel or a cobalt chromium alloy. The base plate 40 includes a distal surface 44 and a proximal surface 46 positioned opposite the distal surface 44. An opening 48 is defined in the distal surface 44, and an inner wall 50 extends distally through the base plate 40 to define a receiving slot 52. As described in greater detail below, the slot 52 is sized to permit the passage of the intramedullary adaptor 30 and various other surgical tools. The base cutting block 12 also includes a pair of fastener guides 54 that are defined in the base plate 40. Each fastener guide 54 includes a bore 56 that is sized to receive fasteners such as, for example, fixation pins 58 (see FIG. 24), which may be utilized to secure the base cutting block 12 to the patient's femur.

As shown in FIG. 2, each pin 108, 120 of the locking mechanism 32 has a socket 128 defined in an outer surface thereof. The sockets 128 are accessible through the bores 110, 122 of the base plate 40, and each socket 128 is sized and shaped to receive a corresponding end of a surgical tool. In an orthopaedic surgical procedure, a surgeon may insert the surgical tool into the socket 128 to move the respective locking tab 100, 102 between the locked position and the unlocked position. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the locking mechanism may include threaded fasteners, latches, pins, or other structures necessary to secure the base cutting block 12 to another surgical instrument. As shown in FIG. 3, the base plate 40 of the base cutting block 12 has a side wall 132 that extends between the distal surface 44 and the proximal surface 46. The side wall 132 has an opening 134 defined therein, and an inner wall 136 extends inwardly from the opening 134 to define a channel 138 in the proximal surface 46. The channel 138 includes a cylindrical segment 140 that is sized to receive a corresponding cylindrical pin 142, as described in greater detail below. The channel 138 is aligned with one of the fastener guides 54 such that the bore 56 of the fastener guide 54 opens into the cylindrical segment 140. The base plate 40 has another side wall 144 that is positioned opposite the side wall 132. Another channel (not shown) that is the mirror of the channel 138 extends inwardly from an opening defined in the side wall 144. As described above, the instrument assembly 10 includes a number of modular cutting blocks 14 configured to be secured to the base cutting block 12. Each of the modular cutting blocks 14 is formed from a metallic material, such as, for example, a stainless steel or a cobalt chromium alloy. Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, the modular cutting blocks 14 include an anterior cutting block 16. The anterior cutting block 16 includes a posterior side wall 150 that confronts the anterior side surface 82 of the base cutting block 12 when the anterior cutting block 16 is secured to the block 12. An alignment pin 146 extends outwardly from the posterior side wall 150, and that pin 146 is received in an aperture 148 defined in the base cutting block 12 (see FIG. 2). The anterior cutting block 16 also includes an anterior side wall 152 that is positioned opposite the posterior side wall 150. A distal surface 154 extends between the side walls 150, 152. The anterior cutting block 16 includes an anterior cutting guide 156 that may be used during an orthopaedic surgical procedure to resect an anterior portion of the patient's femur. The anterior cutting guide 156 includes an elongated slot 158 that extends inwardly from an opening 160 defined in the distal surface 154. The elongated slot 158 is sized to receive a cutting saw blade of a surgical saw or other surgical device. The cutting guide 156 includes a planar surface 162 that is connected to the distal surface 154, and the planar surface 162 defines a resection plane 164 that extends through an anterior portion of the patient's femur when the anterior cutting block 16 is secured to the base cutting block 12 on the patient's femur. As described above, the instrument assembly 10 includes a retention mechanism 22 configured to secure each modular cutting block 14 to the base cutting block 12. Each modular cutting block 14 has a pair of mounting brackets 26 configured to engage the mounting brackets 24 of the base cutting block 12, thereby securing the modular cutting block 14 to the block 12. As shown in FIG. 5, each mounting bracket 26 includes a lever arm 166 pivotally coupled to the modular cutting block 14 (in this case, the anterior cutting block 16). The lever arm 166 includes a lever body 168 pivotally coupled to the modular cutting block 14 via a joint 170. The joint 170 includes a cylindrical pin 172 that extends through a mounting hole 174 defined in the lever body 168. Each end (not shown) of the pin 172 is received in an aperture defined in the modular cutting block. The pin 172 defines an axis 176 about which the lever arm 166 may pivot. As shown in FIG. 5, the lever body 168 of the arm 166 is positioned in a passageway 180 extending through the modular cutting block 14. A handle 182 is formed on one end of the lever body 168 and extends outwardly from the passageway 180. A catch 94 is formed on the opposite end of the lever body 168. As described above, the catch 94 is received in one of the recesses 92 defined in the mounting brackets 24 of the base cutting block 12. The catch 94 includes an engagement surface 184 that engages a posterior surface 90 of the mounting brackets 24 to secure the modular cutting block 14 to the base cutting block 12. As described above, the lever arm 166 is configured to pivot about the axis 176, and is moveable between an engaged position (see left side of FIG. 5) and a disengaged position (see right side of FIG. 5). The mounting bracket 26 also includes a biasing element 190 that biases the lever arm 166 is the engaged position. As shown in FIG. 5, the biasing element 190 is a cantilever spring having an end 192 attached to the lever arm 166 and another end 194 engaged with an inner wall 196 of the mounting bracket 26. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the biasing element 190 may be, for example, a coil, torsion, or other spring. In use, a surgeon or other user grasps the handles 182 of the lever arms 166 and pushes in the direction indicated by arrow 200. When the bias exerted by the springs 190 is overcome, the lever arm 166 is pivoted about the axis 176 from the engaged position to the disengaged position. The shafts 84 of the base cutting block 12 may then be aligned with the passageways 180 defined in the modular cutting block 14. The modular cutting block 14 may then be advanced over the shafts 84 such that the modular cutting block 14 confronts the anterior side surface 82 of the base cutting block 12. The surgeon may then release the handles 182, thereby permitting the lever arms 166 to pivot back to the engaged position. In the engaged position, the catch 94 is received in the recess 92 of the mounting brackets 24 of the base cutting block 12 and engages a posterior surface 90 of the mounting bracket 24 to secure the modular cutting block 14 to the base cutting block 12. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the retention mechanism may take other forms. For example, the arrangement of shafts and locking arms may be reversed with the base cutting block be configured to receive the shafts extending from the modular cutting blocks. In other embodiments, each modular cutting block may include a number of locking pins that may be extended and retracted to attach and detach the modular cutting block to the base cutting block. In still other embodiments, the retention mechanism may include an external latch on one block that engages a pin or flange on the block. Referring now to FIG. 6, the modular cutting blocks 14 include a notch cutting block 18. The notch cutting block 18 includes a posterior side wall 202 that confronts the anterior side surface 82 of the base cutting block 12 when the notch cutting block 18 is secured to the block 12.

As described above, the notch cutting block 18 includes a pair of mounting brackets 26 of the retention mechanism 22, which are configured to secure the notch cutting block 18 to the base cutting block 12. The notch cutting block 18 includes a notch cutting guide 206 that may be used during an orthopaedic surgical procedure to form a notch in the patient's femur sized to receive a femoral box of the femoral prosthetic component. As shown in FIG. 6, the notch cutting block 18 has an opening 208 defined in the anterior side wall 204, and an inner wall 210 extends posteriorly from the opening 208 to define the notch cutting guide 206 in the block 18. The inner wall 210 includes a planar surface 212 that defines a resection plane 214, which extends through a portion of the patient's femur when the notch cutting block 18 is secured to the base cutting block 12 on the patient's femur. In the illustrative embodiment, the resection plane 214 of the notch cutting guide 206 extends orthogonal to the resection planes 74 defined by the posterior cutting guides 68 of the base cutting block 12 when the notch cutting block 18 is secured to the block 12. The inner wall 210 of the notch cutting block 18 also includes a pair of planar surfaces 216 that are connected to the planar surface 212 and extend transverse to the resection plane 214 defined by the surface 212. Each surface 216 defines a resection plane 218 that extends orthogonal to the resection planes 74 defined by the posterior cutting guides 68 of the base cutting block 12 when the notch cutting block 18 is secured to the block 12. The surfaces 212, 216 define a channel 220 of the notch cutting guide 206 sized to receive a surgical saw blade or other surgical instrument. As shown in FIG. 6, the notch cutting block 18 also includes an anterior chamfer cutting guide 222. The anterior chamfer cutting guide 222 includes an elongated slot 224 that extends inwardly from an opening defined in the anterior side wall 204. The elongated slot 224 is sized to receive a cutting saw blade of a surgical saw or other surgical device. The cutting guide 222 includes a planar surface 226 that defines a resection plane 228. The resection plane 228 extends through an anterior portion of the patient's femur when the notch cutting block 18 is secured to the base cutting block 12 on the patient's femur. When the blocks 12, 18 are assembled, the resection plane 228 of the anterior chamfer cutting guide 222 extends obliquely relative to the resection planes 74 defined by the posterior cutting guides 68 such that an obtuse angle is defined between the planes 74, 228. As shown in FIG. 6, a pair of fastener guides 230 are pivotally coupled to the notch cutting block 18. Each guide 230 includes a cylindrical body 232, and a bore 234 is defined in the body 232. The bore 234 is sized to receive fasteners such as, for example, fixation pins 58 (see FIG. 24), which may be utilized to secure the notch cutting block 18 to the patient's femur. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the notch cutting block 18 may include additional fastener guides 230 or other fastening elements to secure the cutting block to the patient's femur. Each cylindrical body 232 extends outwardly through a hole 238 defined in the anterior side wall 204 of the notch cutting block 18. Each fastener guide 230 also includes a hub 240 that is pivotally coupled to the block 18. In that way, the fastener guide 230 may be moved back and forth in the direction indicated by arrow 242 to adjust the orientation of the bore 234 and hence change the location of the fixation pin 58 on the patient's femur. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the fixation guide 230 may be adjustable in other directions. Referring now to FIG. 7, the modular cutting blocks 14 include a distal cutting block 20. The distal cutting block 20 includes a posterior side wall 250 that confronts the anterior side surface 82 of the base cutting block 12 when the distal cutting block 20 is secured to the block 12. The distal cutting block 20 also includes an anterior side wall 252 that is positioned opposite the posterior side wall 250. As described above, the distal cutting block 20 includes a pair of mounting brackets 26 of the retention mechanism 22, which are configured to secure the distal cutting block 20 to the base cutting block 12. The distal cutting block 20 includes a number of distal cutting guides 256 that may be used during an orthopaedic surgical procedure to resect a distal portion of the patient's bone. Each cutting guide 256 includes an elongated slot sized to receive a cutting saw blade of a surgical saw or other surgical device. In the illustrative embodiment, the distal cutting block 20 has ten distal cutting guides 256 extending through the side walls 250, 252. Each distal cutting guide 256 includes a planar surface 258 that defines a resection plane 260. As shown in FIG. 7, the resection planes 260 of the cutting guides 256 extend parallel to, and are spaced from, each other. In the illustrative embodiment, the resection planes 260 of the distal cutting block 20 extends orthogonal to the resection planes 74 defined by the posterior cutting guides 68 of the base cutting block 12 when the distal cutting block 20 is secured to the block 12. The resection planes 260 extend through a distal portion of the patient's femur when the distal cutting block 20 is secured to the base cutting block 12 on the femur. In that way, the cutting guides 256 may be used by the orthopaedic surgeon during the resection of the patient's femur. In the illustrative embodiment, the cutting guides 256 (hence the resection planes 260) are spaced part from each other by about four millimeters. As such, the surgeon may select the particular cutting guide 256 corresponding to the amount of bone to be removed. In other embodiments, the distal cutting block 20 may include any number of cutting guides 256, which may be spaced apart by an amount greater than or less than four millimeters. As shown in FIG. 7, a pair of fastener guides 262 are pivotally coupled to the distal cutting block 20. Each guide 262 includes a cylindrical body 264, and a bore 266 is defined in the body 264. The bore 266 is sized to receive fasteners such as, for example, fixation pins 58 (see FIG. 26), which may be utilized to secure the distal cutting block 20 to the patient's femur. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the distal cutting block 20 may include additional fastener guides 262 or other fastening elements to secure the cutting block to the patient's femur. Each cylindrical body 264 extends outwardly through a hole 268 defined in the anterior side wall 252 of the distal cutting block 20. Each fastener guide 262 also includes a hub 270 that is pivotally coupled to the block 20. In that way, the fastener guide 262 may be moved back and forth in the direction indicated by arrow 272 to adjust the orientation of the bore 266 and hence change the location of the fixation pin 58 on the patient's femur. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the fastener guide 262 may be adjustable in other directions. Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 9, the instrument assembly 10 includes an intramedullary adaptor 30 configured to be coupled to the base cutting block 12. The intramedullary adaptor 30 is formed from a metallic material, such as, for example, a stainless steel or a cobalt chromium alloy.

The main body 282 is sized and shaped to be received in the medullary canal of the patient's femur, as described in greater detail below. The adaptor 30 also includes a fastener 304 configured to secure the adaptor 30 to an intramedullary surgical instrument, as described in greater detail below. The fastener 304 is positioned in a passageway 306 defined in the body 282 and is configured to rotate relative to the main body 282. A retaining ring 308 is secured to the proximal end 300 of the main body 282, thereby securing the fastener 304 to the main body 282. Referring now to FIG. 9, the fastener 304 includes a head 310 positioned in the passageway 306 and a shaft 312 extending through the retaining ring 308 and outwardly from the body 282 to a proximal end 314. The proximal end 314 of the shaft 312 has a plurality of external threads 316 formed thereon. The head 310 of the fastener 304 has a socket 318 defined therein. In an orthopaedic surgical procedure, a surgeon may insert the surgical tool into the socket 318 to rotate the fastener 304 relative to the main body 282. Referring now to FIGS. 10-18, a number of other surgical instruments for use with the instrument assembly 10 are shown. In FIGS. 10 and 11, one embodiment of a stem stabilizer 320 is shown. The stem stabilizer 320 is formed from a metallic material, such as, for example, a stainless steel or a cobalt chromium alloy. The stem stabilizer 320 includes a cylindrical body 322 extending from an end 324 configured to confront the proximal end 300 of the main body 282 of the adaptor 30 to an end 326 configured to confront the distal end of a stem trial 328 (see FIG. 20). The end 324 of the body 322 has an opening 330 defined therein, and a central passageway 332 extends inwardly from the opening 330 through the body 322. The central passageway 332 is sized to receive the shaft 312 of the intramedullary adaptor 30. A cylindrical inner wall 334 defines the passageway 332, and the inner wall 334 has a plurality of internal threads 338 formed thereon that correspond to the external threads 316 formed on the shaft 312 and the external threads (not shown) formed on the stem trial 328. When the stem trial 328 is secured to the stem stabilizer 320, an intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 is formed (see FIG. 20), as described in greater detail below. As shown in FIG. 11, a pair of slots 340 extend inwardly from the opening 330 on either side of the central passageway 332. Each slot 340 is arcuate in shape and is defined by a pair of substantially planar inner walls 342, 344 and an arcuate inner wall 346 extending between the inner walls 342, 344. As will be described in greater detail below, one alignment lug 302 of the intramedullary adaptor 30 is positioned in each arcuate slot 340 when the intramedullary adaptor 30 is secured to the stem stabilizer 320. Each arcuate inner wall 346 defines an arc 348. The magnitude of the arc 348 is dependant on the permitted rotation of the femoral prosthetic component and therefore varies depending on the choice of prosthetic component. Referring now to FIG. 12, another embodiment of a stem stabilizer (hereinafter stem stabilizer 350) is shown. The stem stabilizer 350 includes a cylindrical body 352 extending from an end 324 configured to confront the proximal end 300 of the main body 282 of the adaptor 30 to an end 326 configured to confront the distal end of a stem trial 328 (see FIG. 20). A medial fin 354 and a lateral fin 356 extend outwardly from an outer surface 358 of the cylindrical body 352. Each of the fins 354, 356 includes an outer edge 360 configured to engage the patient's femur when the stem stabilizer 350 is positioned in the medullary canal. In that way, the fins 354, 356 may provide additional stability during an orthopaedic surgical procedure. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the stem stabilizer may include additional fins having different sizes and different configurations. Like the stem stabilizer 350, the end 324 of the body 352 has an opening 330 defined therein, and a central passageway 332 extends inwardly from the opening 330 through the body 352. The central passageway 332 is sized to receive the shaft 312 of the intramedullary adaptor 30. A cylindrical inner wall 334 defines the passageway 332, and the inner wall 334 has a plurality of internal threads 338 formed thereon that correspond to the external threads 316 formed on the shaft 312. A pair of arcuate slots 340 extend inwardly from the opening 330 on either side of the central passageway 332. Referring now to FIG. 13, a guide block 362 is shown. The guide block 362 is configured to be secured to the base cutting block 12 in place of the intramedullary adaptor 30. The guide block 362 is formed from a metallic material, such as, for example, a stainless steel or a cobalt chromium alloy. The guide block 362 includes a mounting bracket 364 attached to a bushing 366. As will be described in greater detail below, the mounting bracket 364 is sized to be positioned in the receiving slot 52 of the base cutting block 12. The mounting bracket 364 includes a pair of arms 368 extending outwardly from the bushing 366 to respective ends 370. A channel 372 is defined in each end 370 of the arm 368. The channel 372 is sized to receive the ear 114 of the locking tab 100 or the ear 126 of the locking tab 102 of the base cutting block 12. The bushing 366 of the guide block 362 has an opening 374 defined in a distal end 376 thereof. A cylindrical inner wall 378 extends inwardly from the distal end 376 to define a passageway 380 through the bushing 366. The passageway 380 is sized to permit the passage of a surgical drill or reamer. In that way, the block 362 guides the surgical drill or reamer during the orthopaedic surgical procedure. As shown in FIG. 13, the passageway 380 has a longitudinal axis 382. The mounting bracket 364 has a substantially planar distal surface 384. In the illustrative embodiment, an oblique angle is defined between the longitudinal axis 382 and the substantially planar proximal surface 384. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the passageway 380 of the guide block 362 may be resized to accommodate various types of surgical drills or reamers. For example, as shown in FIG. 14, another embodiment of a guide block 386 includes a passageway 388 that has a smaller diameter than the passageway 380. Additionally, the angle defined between the longitudinal axis of the passageway and the distal surface 384 of the mounting bracket 364 may also vary. In other embodiments, the length of the bushing may also vary. Referring now to FIG. 15, a distal spacer block 390 is shown. The block 390 is configured to be secured to base cutting block 12 between the proximal surface 46 of the plate 40 and a distal end of the patient's femur. The distal spacer block 390 is formed from a metallic material, such as, for example, a stainless steel or a cobalt chromium alloy. The spacer block 390 may be one of a plurality of spacer blocks having different sizes and corresponding to different prosthetic augment sizes. The block 390 includes a plate 394 and a pin 396 secured to the plate 394. The plate 394 includes pair of grips 398 formed on each side 400 thereof.

As shown in FIG. 5, the pin 396 of distal spacer block 390 includes a cylindrical shaft 402 sized to be received in the channel 138 defined in the base cutting block 12. The shaft 402 has an outer diameter that is greater than the inner diameter of the cylindrical segment 140 of the channel 138 such that the distal spacer block 390 is secured to the base cutting block 12 via friction. The distal spacer block 390 also includes a stop 404 secured to the plate 394. The stop 404 includes a flange 406 that confronts one of the side wall 132, 144 of the base cutting block 12 when the distal spacer block 390 is properly positioned. The stop 404 also includes a grip 408, which the surgeon may use to withdraw the block 390 from between the base cutting block 12 and the patient's femur. An indicator (not shown) may be etched into the outer surface 410 of the stop 404 to indicate the size of the spacer block 390. The spacer block 390 also includes a bore 412 that is defined in the plate 394. As shown in FIG. 15, the bore 412 divides the pin 396 into two sections 414, 416.

The handle 436 is formed from a metallic material, such as, for example, a stainless steel or a cobalt chromium alloy. It should also be appreciated that the handle 436 may be formed from a hard polymeric material. The body 444 includes a grip 446 that may be utilized by the surgeon to manipulate the handle 436. The spacer end 440 includes a pair of arms 450 extending outwardly from the body 444 of the handle 436. Each arm 450 has a bore 452 defined therein, and an opening 454 is defined between the arms 450. The spacer end 440 has a thickness 456 that corresponds to the thickness of a tibial trial. Similarly, the spacer end 442 also includes a pair of arms 458 extending outwardly from the body 444 of the handle 436. Each arm 458 has a bore 460 defined therein, and an opening 462 is defined between the arms 458. The spacer end 442 has a thickness 464 that corresponds to the thickness of another tibial trial. In the illustrative embodiment, the thicknesses 456, 464 of the spacer ends 440, 442 are different. Each shim block 438 includes an articulation surface 470 configured to engage the articulating surface 62 of the base cutting block 12. The shim blocks 438 are formed from a hard polymeric material, such as, for example, acetal. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the blocks 438 may be formed from a metallic material, such as, for example, stainless steel or cobalt chromium. The shim block 438 has a pair of arms 472 that correspond to the arms 450, 458 of the handle 436. Each arm 472 has a post 474 extending downwardly from a bottom surface 476. Each post 474 is sized to be received in each bore 452, 460 defined in the handle 436. The shim block 438 may include a spring or other retention device to secure the shim block 438 to the handle 436. As described above, the gap assessment tool 434 includes a plurality of shim blocks 438, each of which may be separately attached to the handle 436. Each shim block 438 has a different thickness 478 such that the surgeon is able to assemble a gap assessment tool of one size and configuration, evaluate the performance, and then modify the gap assessment tool as necessary to determine intraoperatively the flexion and extension gaps of the patient, as described in greater detail below. Returning to FIG. 1, the instrument assembly 10 also includes a cover 28 configured to be positioned over the shafts 84 of the base cutting block. The cover 28 has a body 480 that includes a substantially planar posterior surface 482. In the illustrative embodiment, the body 480 is formed from a polymeric material, such as, for example, acetal. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the cover may be formed from a metallic material. The posterior surface 482 of the cover 28 confronts the anterior side surface 82 of the base cutting block 12 when the cover 28 is secured thereto. A pair of openings 484 are defined in the posterior surface 482. The openings 484 are sized and positioned to receive the shafts 84 of the base cutting block 12. The cover 28 also includes a pair of grips 488 defined on sides 490 of the body 480. A surgeon may use the grips 488 to align the cover 28 with the base cutting block 12 and then advance the cover 28 over the shafts 84. The assembly 10 may be utilized during the performance of an orthopaedic surgical procedure similar to that shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B. As shown in FIGS. 20-23, an orthopaedic instrument construct 500 is formed from the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336, the intramedullary adaptor 30, and the base cutting block 12. The orthopaedic instrument construct 500 is attached to a distal end 502 of a patient's femur 504, with the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 and the proximal end 314 of the intramedullary adaptor 30 positioned in the medullary canal 506 of the patient's femur 504. A gap assessment may then be performed and femoral rotation set. As shown in FIGS. 24-32, various modular cutting block 14 may be separately secured to the base cutting block 12 (with and without the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 and the intramedullary adaptor 30 secured thereto). Each cutting block 14 may be used to resect portions of the distal end 502 of the patient's femur 504. A guide block 362 may be attached to the base cutting block 12 to guide, for example, a surgical drill used to ream the medullary canal 506. Referring now to FIGS. 19A and 19B, an illustrative orthopaedic surgical procedure 600 utilizing the assembly 10 is shown. In procedure block 602, the medullary canal 506 of the patient's femur 504 is initially prepared. To do so, an orthopaedic surgeon may drill and/or ream the medullary canal 506 to receive the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336. Multiple drills or reamers may be used to increase the size of opening 510 of the medullary canal 506 of the patient's femur 504. After preparing the medullary canal 506 of the patient's femur 504, the surgeon may assemble the instrument construct 500 and insert the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 into the medullary canal 506 in procedure block 604. To do so, the surgeon may select the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 from a plurality of intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336. For example, the surgeon may select a stem trial 328 and a stem stabilizer 320, 350 from a plurality of stem trials 328 and a plurality of stem stabilizers 320, 350. The stem trials 328 may vary in length, diameter, or other aspect, and the surgeon selects the stem trial 328 based on the patient's anatomy and the type of prosthetic stem component to be included in the femoral prosthesis. Similarly, the stem stabilizer may be selected based on the patient's anatomy and whether additional stability may be needed in the medullary canal 506. When the surgeon has selected an appropriate stem trial 328 and stem stabilizer 320, 350, the surgeon may thread the stem trial 328 onto the proximal end 326 of the stem stabilizer 350 to form the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 shown in FIG. 20. It should also be appreciated that in other embodiments the stem trials and stem stabilizers may be formed as single, monolithic units of different sizes and configurations. It should also be appreciated that in other embodiments the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 may take the form of a femoral broach having a plurality of teeth configured to engage the patient's femur 504 when inserted into the medullary canal 506. After selecting the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument, the surgeon may assemble the instrument construct 500 in procedure block 608. To do so, the surgeon may align the end 324 of the stem stabilizer 350 with the fastener 304 of the intramedullary adaptor 30. The threaded shaft 312 of the fastener 304 may be advanced into engagement with the threaded inner wall 334 of the stem stabilizer 350. A surgeon may use a driver or other surgical tool to rotate the fastener 304 to thread the shaft 312 into the stem stabilizer 350, thereby securing the intramedullary adaptor 30 to the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336. When the adaptor 30 is secured to the instrument 336, the alignment lugs 302 of the adaptor 30 are positioned arcuate slots 340 of the stem stabilizer 350. The intramedullary adaptor 30 may be then attached to the base cutting block 12. To do so, the mounting bracket 280 of the adaptor 30 is positioned in the receiving slot 52 of the base cutting block 12. A surgeon may use a driver or other surgical tool to rotate the locking tabs 100, 102 about respective axes 112, 124 as indicated by arrows 512 in FIG. 20. As the locking tabs 100, 102 rotate, the ears 114, 126 are advanced into the channels 292, 294 defined in the mounting bracket 280, thereby securing the adaptor 30 to the block 12 and forming the instrument construct 500 shown in FIG. 20. The surgeon may choose to attach the adaptor 30 to the base cutting block 12 before attaching the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 to the adaptor 30. After the instrument construct 500 is assembled, the surgeon may insert the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 into the medullary canal 506 in procedure block 610. To do so, the surgeon aligns the end 514 of the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 with the opening 510 of the medullary canal 506 as shown in FIG. 20. The surgeon may advance the instrument construct 500 such that the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 advances through the opening 510 and into the medullary canal 506. The fins 354, 356 of the stem stabilizer 350 are moved into engagement with the femur 504. A mallet or other surgical tool may be used to fully insert the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 in the medullary canal 506 and seat the base cutting block 12 on the distal end 502 of the patient's femur 504. It should also be appreciated that in other embodiments the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 may be positioned in the medullary canal 506 prior to attachment to the adaptor 30. After the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 is positioned in the medullary canal 506 and the base cutting block 12 on the distal end 502 of the patient's femur 504, the surgeon may adjust the base cutting block 12 on the distal end 502 in procedure block 612. To do so, the surgeon may insert a driver or other surgical tool into the socket 318 defined in the fastener 304 of the intramedullary adaptor 30 to loosen the connection between the adaptor 30 and the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336. In that way, the adaptor 30 and the base cutting block 12 are permitted to rotate relative to the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336. The surgeon also attached the cover 28 to the base cutting block 12 to cover the exposed shafts 84. To adjust the base cutting block 12, the surgeon performs a gap assessment in procedure block 614 and sets the femoral rotation of the base cutting block 12 in procedure block 616. It should be appreciated that blocks 614, 616 may be performed in any order. In procedure block 614, the surgeon assesses the flexion and extension gaps through the range of motion. To do so, the surgeon selects a gap assessment tool 434. The surgeon may use only the handle 436 and one of the spacer ends 440, 442 having a desired thickness. Alternatively, the surgeon may select a shim block 438. As shown in FIG. 21, the surgeon may attach the shim block 438 to one of the spacer ends 440, 442 of the handle 436 to assemble the gap assessment tool 434. As shown in FIG. 21, a gap 516 is defined between the base cutting block 12 and a tibial trial component 518 attached to a patient's tibia 520. With the patient's knee in flexion as shown in FIG. 21, the surgeon may insert the gap assessment tool 434 into the gap 516. The surgeon may move the knee between flexion (FIG. 21) and extension (FIG. 22) to evaluate the gap 516 and the stability of the construct throughout the range of motion. The surgeon may substitute one shim block 438 for a shim block of different thickness to achieve the desired gap geometry. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the gap assessment may be performed with another type of tensioning device, such as, for example, a laminar spreader. In procedure block 616, the surgeon sets the femoral rotation of the base cutting block 12. To do so, the surgeon may balance the base cutting block 12 parallel to the tibial trial component 518 at 90 degrees of flexion as shown in FIG. 23. The surgeon may grasp the side walls 132, 144 of the base cutting block 12 to rotate the base cutting block 12 in the direction indicated by arrow 522 until the gap 516 defined between the base cutting block 12 and the tibial trial component 518 is rectangular. As the base cutting block 12 is rotated, the alignment lugs 302 of the adaptor 30 are advanced along the slots 340 of the stem stabilizer 350. Engagement between the alignment lugs 302 and the planar inner walls 342, 344 of the stem stabilizer 350 prevents the surgeon from rotating the base cutting block 12 beyond a predetermined angle. When the base cutting block 12 is balanced, the surgeon may a driver or other surgical tool to rotate the fastener 304 to secure the intramedullary adaptor 30 to the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336, thereby preventing relative movement between the adaptor 30 and the base cutting block 12 and the instrument 336. Alternatively, the surgeon may set the femoral rotation by inserting two Steinman pins (not shown) into the channels 138 defined in the side wall 132, 144 of the base cutting block 12. With the Steinman pins extending outwardly from the block 12, the surgeon may orient the block 12 referencing the medial and lateral epicondyles. When the base cutting block 12 is properly position, the surgeon may rotate the fastener 304 to secure the intramedullary adaptor 30 to the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336. Returning to FIG. 19A, the procedure 600 may proceed to procedure block 618 in which the surgeon determines if the instrument construct 500 requires additional stability. If the surgeon decides additional stability is needed, the procedure 600 advances to procedure block 620 in which a fixation pin 58 is inserted into a fastener guide 54 of the base cutting block 12, as shown in FIG. 24. One or more fixation pins may be used to further secure the base cutting block 12 to the distal end 502 of the patient's femur 504. The procedure 600 may then proceed to procedure block 622. If the surgeon determines in procedure block 618 that the instrument construct 500 is sufficiently stable on the distal end 502 of the patient's femur 504, the procedure 600 proceeds to procedure block 622 in which the surgeon determines whether the femoral prosthesis requires a prosthetic augment component. The surgeon may make that determination based on the gap assessment performed in procedure block 614. If the surgeon determines that an augment component is unnecessary, the procedure advances to procedure block 624. If an augment component is required, the procedure advances to procedure block 626. In procedure block 626, the surgeon attaches the distal cutting block 20 to the base cutting block 12. To do so, the cover 28 is detached from the base cutting block 12, and the distal cutting block 20 aligned with the base cutting block 12. A surgeon may grasp the handles 182 of the lever arms 166 of the distal cutting block and push in the direction indicated by arrow 200 in FIG. 24. When the bias exerted by the springs 190 is overcome, the lever arm 166 is pivoted about the axis 176 from the engaged position to the disengaged position. The shafts 84 of the base cutting block 12 may then be aligned with the passageways 180 defined in the distal cutting block 20. The distal cutting block 20 may then be advanced over the shafts 84 such that distal cutting block 20 confronts the anterior side surface 82 of the base cutting block 12. The surgeon may then release the handles 182, thereby permitting the lever arms 166 to pivot back to the engaged position. In the engaged position, the catch 94 is received in the recess 92 of the mounting brackets 24 of the base cutting block 12 and engages a posterior surface 90 of the mounting bracket 24 to secure the distal cutting block 20 to the base cutting block 12. After the distal cutting block 20 is secured to the base cutting block 12, the surgeon may perform the distal resection in procedure block 628. To do so, the surgeon may use the cutting guides 256 defined in the distal cutting block 20, as shown in FIG. 24. For example, the surgeon may select the cutting guide 256 of the distal cutting block 20 corresponding to a desired amount of bone to be removed. The surgeon may perform the distal resection by inserting a bone saw blade 524 into the selected cutting guide 256 of the distal cutting block 20. The surgeon may also utilize fastener guides 262 to attach additional fixation pins to the patient's femur 504. After performing the distal resection, the procedure 600 advances to procedure block 630 in which a distal spacer block 390 is attached to the base cutting block 12. To do so, the surgeon selects the distal spacer block 390 corresponding to the amount of bone removed during the resection. The surgeon may then align the pin 396 of the distal spacer block 390 with the channel 138 defined in the side wall 132. As shown in FIG. 25, the surgeon may then advance the pin 396 into the channel 138 such that the distal spacer block 390 is positioned between the base cutting block 12 and the distal end 502 of the patient's femur 504. Returning to FIGS. 19A and 19B, when the surgeon determines in procedure block 622 that an augment component is unnecessary, the procedure advances to procedure block 624. In procedure block 624, the anterior cutting block 16 is attached to the base cutting block 12. If a distal resection has been performed, the surgeon first removes the distal cutting block 20 from the base cutting block 12 by operating the lever arm 166 to remove the catches 94 from engagement with the shafts 84 of the base cutting block 12. The surgeon may then attach the anterior cutting block 16 by operating the retention mechanism in a manner similar to that described above. When the anterior cutting block 16 is secured to the base cutting block 12, the procedure 600 advances to procedure block 632. In procedure block 632, the surgeon may use the cutting guide 156 defined in the anterior cutting block 16. As shown in FIG. 26, the surgeon may perform the anterior resection by inserting the bone saw blade 524 into the cutting guide 156 of the anterior cutting block 16. The anterior resection removes an anterior portion of the patient's femur 504 to create a substantially planar anterior surface. After performing the anterior resection, the surgeon may perform the posterior resection in procedure block 634. To do so, the surgeon may use the posterior cutting guides 68 defined in the base cutting block 12, as shown in FIG. 27. For example, the surgeon may select one or more cutting guides 68 of the base cutting block 12 corresponding to a desired amount of bone to be removed. The surgeon may perform the posterior resection by inserting the bone saw blade 524 into the selected cutting guide 68 and removing posterior portions of the patient's femoral condyles to create a substantially planar surface. The surgeon may also use one or more of the posterior cutting guides 68 to perform a posterior augment resection. After performing the posterior resection, the procedure 600 advances to procedure block 636 in which the surgeon performs a posterior chamfer resection. In procedure block 636, the surgeon may use the posterior chamfer cutting guide 70 defined in the base cutting block 12. The surgeon may perform the posterior chamfer resection by inserting the bone saw blade 524 into the cutting guide 70 of the base cutting block 12. The posterior chamfer resection removes a posterior chamfer portion of the patient's femur 504 to create a substantially planar anterior surface. Returning now to FIG. 19B, the procedure 600 advances to procedure block 638 in which the surgeon determines if the instrument construct requires 500 additional stability. If the surgeon decides additional stability is needed, the procedure 600 advances to procedure block 640 in which a posterior shim 420 is inserted into one or more the cutting guides 66 defined in the base cutting block 12. To do so, the surgeon may use the grip 424 inserts the body 422 of a posterior shim 420 into a cutting guide 68, as shown in FIG. 28. When the shim 420 is inserted into the cutting guide 68, the spring 432 engages the base cutting block 12 to retain the posterior shim 420 in the cutting guide 66. The procedure 600 may then proceed to procedure block 642. In block 642, the surgeon attaches the notch cutting block 18 to the base cutting block 12 after removing the anterior cutting block 16 therefrom. To do so, the surgeon may then attach the notch cutting block 18 by operating the retention mechanism 22 in a manner similar to that described above. When the notch cutting block 18 is secured to the base cutting block 12, the procedure 600 advances to procedure block 644. In procedure block 644, the surgeon performs an anterior chamfer resection. To do so, the surgeon may use the anterior chamfer cutting guide 222 defined in the notch cutting block 18. The surgeon may perform the anterior chamfer resection by inserting the bone saw blade 524 into the cutting guide 222 as shown in FIG. 28. The anterior chamfer resection removes an anterior chamfer portion of the patient's femur 504 to create a substantially planar anterior surface. As described above, the anterior chamfer cutting guide may be defined in the base cutting block 12 in other embodiments, and in such embodiments the surgeon may use that cutting guide to perform the anterior chamfer resection. After performing the anterior chamfer resection, the procedure 600 proceeds to procedure block 646 in which the surgeon determines whether a notch cut is required. The surgeon may make that determination based on whether the femoral prosthetic component includes a femoral box. If the surgeon determines that a notch cut is unnecessary, the procedure advances to procedure block 648. If the notch cut is required, the procedure advances to procedure block 650. In procedure block 650, the surgeon utilizes the notch cutting guide 206 of the block 18 to remove portions of the patient's femur 504, as shown in FIGS. 29 and 30. To do so, the surgeon may advance the bone saw blade into the cutting guide 206. The surgeon may engage the planar surfaces 216 with the bone saw blade 524 while removing portions of the patient's femur 504. The surgeon may remove the intramedullary adaptor 30 and the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 before completing the notch cut. To do so, the surgeon may use a driver or other surgical tool to rotate the locking tabs 100, 102 about respective axes 112, 124 as indicated by arrows 530 in FIG. 29. As the locking tabs 100, 102 are rotated, the ears 114, 126 are advanced out of the channels 292, 294 defined in the mounting bracket 280 such that the adaptor 30 is decoupled from the block 12. The adaptor 30 and the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 336 may then be removed from the patient's femur 504. As shown in FIG. 30, the surgeon may advance the bone saw blade 524 into the cutting guide 206. The surgeon may engage the planar surface 212 with the bone saw blade 524 to remove a portion of the patient's femur 504, thereby completing the notch cut. After completing the notch cut, the procedure 600 may advance to procedure block 648. Returning to FIG. 19B, if the surgeon determined in procedure block 646 that a notch cut is unnecessary, the procedure also advance to procedure block 648. In block 648, one of the guide blocks 362, 386 is selected and attached to the base cutting block 12. To do so, the surgeon may select the guide block 362 and position the mounting bracket 364 in the receiving slot 52 of the base cutting block 12, as shown in FIG. 31. A surgeon may use a driver or other surgical tool to rotate the locking tabs 100, 102 about respective axes 112, 124 as indicated. As the locking tabs 100, 102 are rotated, the ears 114, 126 are advanced into the channels 372 defined in the mounting bracket 364, thereby securing the guide block 362 to the block 12. The procedure 600 may then advance to procedure block 652 in which the surgeon reams the patient's femur 504 to a desired depth. To do so, a reamer 532 may be inserted into the passageway 380 defined in the guide block 362. The reamer 532 may then be engaged with the patient's femur and operated to remove the desired amount of bone. As shown in FIG. 32, the surgeon may select the guide block 386 and attach the block 386 to the base cutting block 12. A reamer 534 may be inserted into the passageway 388 defined in the guide block 386. The reamer 534 may then be engaged with the patient's femur and advanced into the medullary canal 506 until a line 536 corresponding to a desired depth is aligned with the upper surface 538 of the guide block 386.
