It is well known that contact lenses can be used to improve vision. Various contact lenses have been commercially produced for many years. Hydrogel contact lenses are very popular today. These lenses are formed from hydrophilic polymers and copolymers containing repeating units from hydroxyethylmethylacrylate (HEMA). Of these contact lenses formed from copolymers of HEMA and methacrylic acid, are among the most comfortable, and have the lowest rate of adverse events. Contact lenses formed from copolymers of HEMA and MAA, such ACUVUE contact lenses, display substantial amounts of lysozyme uptake (greater than 500 pg) and retain a majority of the uptaken proteins in their native state. However, hydrogel contact lenses generally have oxygen permeabilities that are less than about Contact lenses made from silicone hydrogels have been disclosed. These silicone hydrogel lenses have oxygen permeabilities greater than about 60, and many provide reduced levels of hypoxia compared to conventional hydrogel contact lenses. However, silicone hydrogel lenses have different rates for adverse events than conventional hydrogels, and it would be desirable to maintain the oxygen transmissibility of a silicone hydrogel, but achieve the low adverse event rate of the best conventional hydrogel lenses. Unfortunately, attempts to add anionic components to silicone hydrogels in the past have produced contact lenses which are not hydrolytically stable and display moduli which increase when exposed to water and heat. For example, the modulus of Purevision lenses (Bausch & Lomb) increase from 155 psi to 576 psi when heated at 95°C for one week. It believed that the cause of this increase in modulus is the hydrolysis of terminal siloxane groups followed by condensation reactions to form new siloxane bonds and introduce new crosslinks. Even though Purevision lenses contain about 1 weight% ionicity, they uptake relatively low lysozyme levels (less than about 50 pg), and a majority of the protein uptaken is denatured. It has been suggested that the instability of ionic silicone hydrogels could be reduced by using silicones components having bulky alkyl or aryl groups instead of silicone monomers such as 3-methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane (“TRIS”) or 2-methyl-, 2-hydroxy-3-[3-[ 1,3,3, 3-tetramethyl-l - [(trimethylsilyl)oxy]disiloxanyl]propoxy]propyl ester (“SiGMA”). However, the bulky siloxane monomers are not commercially available and may be expensive to make.

The medical devices, ophthalmic devices and lenses of the present invention are made from silicone elastomers or hydrogels, which include but are not limited to silicone hydrogels, and silicone-fluorohydrogels. These hydrogels contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers that are covalently bound to one another in the cured lens. As used herein “uptake” means associated in, with or on the lens, deposited in or on the lens. As used herein “reactive mixture” refers to the mixture of components (both reactive and non-reactive) which are mixed together and subjected to polymerization conditions to form the ionic silicone hydrogels of the present invention. The reactive mixture comprises reactive components such as monomers, macromers, prepolymers; cross-linkers, initiators, diluents and additives such as wetting agents, release agents, dyes, light absorbing compounds such as UV absorbers and photochromic compounds, any of which may be reactive or non-reactive but are capable of being retained within the resulting medical device, as well as pharmaceutical and neutriceutical compounds. It will be appreciated that a wide range of additives may be added based upon the medical device which is made, and its intended use. Concentrations of components of the reactive mixture are given in weight % of all components in the reaction mixture, excluding diluent. When diluents are used their concentrations are given as weight % based upon the amount of all components in the reaction mixture and the diluent. Anionic components are components comprising at least one anionic group and at least one reactive group. Anionic groups are groups which bear a negative charge. Examples of anionic groups include carboxylate groups, phosphates, sulfates, sulfonates, phosphonates, borates, mixtures thereof and the like. In one embodiment the anionic groups comprise three to ten carbon atoms, and in another, three to eight carbon atoms. In an embodiment the anionic groups comprise carboxylic acid groups. Reactive groups include groups that can undergo free radical and/or cationic polymerization under polymerization conditions. Non-limiting examples of free radical reactive groups include (meth)acrylates, styryls, vinyls, vinyl ethers, Ci_6alkyl(meth)acrylates, (meth)acrylamides, Ci-6alkyl(meth)acrylamides, Nvinyllactams, N-vinylamides, C2-i2alkenyls, C2-i2alkenylphenyls, C2-i2alkenylnaphthyls, C2-6alkenylphenylCi.6alkyls, O-vinylcarbamates and O-vinylcarbonates. Non-limiting examples of cationic reactive groups include vinyl ethers or epoxide groups and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the reactive groups comprises (meth)acrylate, acryloxy, (meth)acrylamide, and mixtures thereof. Any chemical name preceded by (meth), for example (meth)acrylate, includes both the unsubstituted and methyl substituted compound. Examples of suitable anionic components include reactive carboxylic acids, including alkylacryl acids, such as (meth)acrylic acid, acrylic acid, itaconic acid, crotonic acid, cinnamic acid, vinylbenzoic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, monoesters of furmaric acid, maelic acid and itaconic acid; N-vinyloxycarbonyl alanine (VENAL), reactive sulfonate salts, including sodium-2-(acrylamido)-2-methylpropane sulphonate, 3sulphopropyl (meth)acrylate potassium salt, 3-sulphopropyl (meth)acrylate sodium salt, bis 3sulphopropyl itaconate di sodium, bis 3sulphopropyl itaconate di potassium, vinyl sulphonate sodium salt, vinyl sulphonate salt, styrene sulfonate, sulfoethyl methacrylate and mixtures thereof and the like. In one embodiment the anionic component is selected from reactive carboxylic acids, in another from methacrylic acid and N-vinyloxycarbonyl alanine. In one embodiment the ionic component comprises methacrylic acid. In one embodiment, the anionic components is included in the reactive mixture in amounts between about 0.05 and about 0.8 weight% and in some embodiments between about 0.1 and about 0.8 weight%. In another embodiment, the anionic component comprises at least one carboxylic acid group and is present in the reactive mixture in amounts between about 0.1 mmol/1 OOg and about 1 0 mmol/g. By maintaining the concentration of anioinic component within the ranges recited herein, the stability of the polymer may be improved. Surprisingly, it has been found that polymers having the amounts of anionic component recited herein have desirable protein uptake profiles in addition to improved stability. In another embodiment, the amount of anionic component may vary based upon the structure and concentration of the silicone components as well as the structure of the anionic component so long as the molar product of the anionic groups and the Si from TMS groups is below the mole product described below. The silicone hydrogel polymers of the present invention display stable modulus. As used herein, stable modulus are those which increase less than about 30%, and in some embodiments less than about 20% over eight weeks, at 55°C. In some embodiments the silicone hydrogel polymers of the present invention display modulus that increase by less than about 20% over 20 weeks at 55 °C. Silicone components are reactive and non-reactive components which comprise at least one “-Si-0-Si-“group. It is preferred that silicone and its attached oxygen account for about 10 weight percent of said silicone component, more preferably more than about weight percent. Prior attempts to add anionic components to silicone hydrogels have generally resulted in polymers which display modulii which increase over time or when exposed to heat. It is believed that the cause of the increasing modulus is the hydrolysis of terminal siloxane groups followed by condensation reactions to form new siloxane bonds and introduce new crosslinks. Hydrolytic stability of silicone groups (specifically the siliconoxygen bond) is believed to be influenced by the substituents on the Si atom. Bulkier groups provide greater hydrolytic stability through increased steric hindrance. The substituents can be alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl etc.), aryl (e.g. benzyl) or even other silicon-containing groups. On the basis of steric hindrance, silicone materials containing trimethylsilyl (-OSiMej) groups (such as SiMAA or TRIS) are generally less hydrolytically stable in the presence of ionic components than compounds containing polydimethyl siloxane [(-OSiMe2)n] chains, such as mPDMS. Thus, in this embodiment, the stability of the polymer is further improved by selection of the silicone containing components in combination with controlling the concentration of the anionic component. In one embodiment, the silicone component comprises at least one polydimethylsiloxane chain, and in another embodiment, all silicone components are free of TMS groups. In one embodiment of the present invention the product of the mole percent of silicon (Si) in a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group in the silicone component and mole % anionic group in the ionic component is less than about 0.002, in some embodiments less than about 0.001 and in others less than about 0.0006. This is calculated as follows: 1) In calculating the mole fractions according to the present invention, the reactive components of the monomer mix (i.e. excluding diluent(s) and processing aids which are not permanently incorporated into the lens) are represented as weight fractions summing up to a total of 100 g. 2) The moles anionic group = (grams of anionic component/MW of anionic component) * number of anionic groups in the anionic component. For Example 1, containing 1% methacylic acid, the calculation is (1 gm/86 gm/mol)*l = 0.012 moles carboxylate. 3) The moles TMS = (grams silicone component/MW of silicone component)* number of TMS groups per silicone component. For example, in Example 1, containing 30 gm SiMAA the calculation is (30 gm/422.7 gm/mol)* 2 = 0.142 moles TMS. In formulations containing a plurality of silicone components having TMS groups, the moles TMS are calculated for each silicone component and then summed. 4) The stability product is calculated by multiplying the values for the moles carboxylate and mole TMS. Thus the stability product for Example 1 is 0.012 * 0.142 = 0.0017. Thus, in this embodiment, the silicone components, ionic components and their amounts used to make hydrogels of the present invention are selected such that the stability product, does not exceed the values specified herein. In another embodiment, the silicone components used contain no TMS groups, thereby providing stability products of zero. Silicone-containing components which contain no TMS groups include those disclosed in W02008/0412158, and reactive PDMS components of Formula I: R1 R1— Si— d1 R1 O-SiH R O b R1 i „ wherein b is 2 to 20, 3 to 15 or in some embodiments 3 to 10; at least one terminal R1 comprises a monovalent reactive group, the other terminal R1 comprises a monovalent reactive group or a monovalent alkyl group having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, and the remaining R1 are selected from monovalent alkyl groups having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, and in another embodiment from monovalent alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.

Any of the foregoing polysiloxanes can also be used as the silicone-containing component in this invention. In one embodiment of the present invention where a modulus of less than about psi desired, the majority of the mass fraction of the silicone-containing components used in the lens formulation should contain only one polymerizable functional group (“monofunctional silicone containing component”). In this embodiment, to insure the desired balance of oxygen transmissibility and modulus preferred that all components having more than one polymerizable functional group (“multifunctional components”) make up no more than 10 mmol/ 100 g of the reactive components, and preferably no more than 7 mmol/100 g of the reactive components.

Hydrophilic monomers can be any of the hydrophilic monomers known to be useful to make hydrogels. One class of suitable hydrophilic monomers include acrylicor vinyl-containing monomers. Such hydrophilic monomers may themselves be used as crosslinking agents, however, where hydrophilic monomers having more than one polymerizable functional group are used, their concentration should be limited as discussed above to provide a contact lens having the desired modulus. The term "vinyl-type" or "vinyl-containing" monomers refer to monomers containing the vinyl grouping (-CH=CH2) and are generally highly reactive. Such hydrophilic vinyl-containing monomers are known to polymerize relatively easily. "Acrylic-type" or "acrylic-containing" monomers are those monomers containing the acrylic group: (CH2=CRCOX) wherein R is H or CH3, and X is O or N, which are also known to polymerize readily, such as N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMA), 2hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), glycerol methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylamide, polyethyleneglycol monomethacrylate, mixtures thereof and the like.

Still further examples are the hydrophilic vinyl carbonate or vinyl carbamate monomers disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 5,070,215, and the hydrophilic oxazolone monomers disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 4,910,277. Other suitable hydrophilic monomers will be apparent to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment the hydrophilic comprises at least one hydrophilic monomer such as DMA, HEMA, glycerol methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylamide, NVP, Nvinyl-N-methyl acrylamide, polyethyleneglycol monomethacrylate, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the hydrophilic monomers comprise at least one of DMA, HEMA, NVP and N-vinyl-N-methyl acrylamide and mixtures thereof. In another embodiment, the hydrophilic monomer comprises DMA. The hydrophilic monomers may be present in a wide range of amounts, depending upon the specific balance of properties desired. Amounts of hydrophilic monomer up to about 50 and preferably between about 5 and about 50 weight %, based upon all reactive components are acceptable. For example, in one embodiment lenses of the present invention comprise a water content of at least about 25%, and in another embodiment between about 30 and about 70%. For these embodiments, the hydrophilic monomer may be included in amounts between about 20 and about 50 weight %. Other components that can be present in the reaction mixture used to form the contact lenses of this invention include wetting agents, such as those disclosed in US 6,367,929, WO03/22321, WO03/22322, compatibilizing components, such as those disclosed in US2003/1 62,862 and US2003/2003/125,498, ultra-violet absorbing compounds, medicinal agents, antimicrobial compounds, copolymerizable and nonpolymerizable dyes, release agents, reactive tints, pigments, combinations thereof and the like. The sum of additional components may be up to about 20 wt%. In one embodiment the reaction mixtures comprise up to about 18 wt% wetting agent, and in another embodiment, between about 5 and about 1 8 wt% wetting agent. A polymerization catalyst may be included in the reaction mixture. The polymerization initiators includes compounds such as lauryl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, isopropyl percarbonate, azobisisobutyronitrile, and the like, that generate free radicals at moderately elevated temperatures, and photoinitiator systems such as aromatic alphahydroxy ketones, alkoxyoxybenzoins, acetophenones, acylphosphine oxides, bisacylphosphine oxides, and a tertiary amine plus a diketone, mixtures thereof and the like. Illustrative examples of photoinitiators are 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone, 2hydroxy-2-methyl1 -phenyl-propan1 -one, bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide (DMBAPO), bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl phosphineoxide (Irgacure 819), 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyldiphenyl phosphine oxide and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide, benzoin methyl ester and a combination of camphorquinone and ethyl 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzoate. Commercially available visible light initiator systems include Irgacure 819, Irgacure 1700, Irgacure 1800, Irgacure 819, Irgacure 1850 (all from Ciba Specialty Chemicals) and Lucirin TPO initiator (available from BASF). Commercially available UV photoinitiators include Darocur 1173 and Darocur 2959 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals). These and other photoinitators which may be used are disclosed in Volume III, Photoinitiators for Free Radical Cationic & Anionic Photopolymerization, 2nd Edition by J.V. Crivello& K. Dietliker; edited by G. Bradley; John Wiley and Sons; New York; 1998. The initiator is used in the reaction mixture in effective amounts to initiate photopolymerization of the reaction mixture, e.g., from about 0.1 to about 2 parts by weight per 100 parts of reactive monomer. Polymerization of the reaction mixture can be initiated using the appropriate choice of heat or visible or ultraviolet light or other means depending on the polymerization initiator used. Alternatively, initiation can be conducted without a photoinitiator using, for example, e-beam. However, when a photoinitiator is used, the preferred initiators are bisacylphosphine oxides, such as bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)- phenyl phosphine oxide (Irgacure 819®) or a combination of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide (DMBAPO), and in another embodiment the method of polymerization initiation via visible light activation. A preferred initiator is bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl phosphine oxide (Irgacure 819®). The reactive components (silicone containing component, hydrophilic monomers, wetting agents, and other components which are reacted to form the lens) are mixed together either with or without a diluent to form the reaction mixture. In one embodiment a diluent is used having a polarity sufficiently low solubilize the non-polar components in the reactive mixture at reaction conditions. One way to characterize the polarity of the diluents of the present invention is via the Hansen solubility parameter, Sp. In certain embodiments, the 8p is less than about 10, and preferably less than about 6. Suitable diluents are further disclosed in US Ser. No 60/452898 and US 6,020,445. Classes of suitable diluents include, without limitation, alcohols having carbons, amides having 10 to 20 carbon atoms derived from primary amines, ethers, polyethers, ketones having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, and carboxylic acids having carbon atoms. For all solvents, as the number of carbons increase, the number of polar moieties may also be increased to provide the desired level of water miscibility. In some embodiments, primary and tertiary alcohols are preferred. Preferred classes include alcohols having 4 to 20 carbons and carboxylic acids having 10 to 20 carbon atoms. In one embodiment the diluents are selected from 1,2-octanediol, t-amyl alcohol, 3-methyl-3-pentanol, decanoic acid, 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol, tripropylene methyl ether (TPME), butoxy ethyl acetate, mixtures thereof and the like. In one embodiment the diluents are selected from diluents that have some degree of solubility in water. In some embodiments at least about three percent of the diluent is miscible water. Examples of water soluble diluents include 1-octanol, 1-pentanol, 1hexanol, 2-hexanol, 2-octanol, 3-methyl-3-pentanol, 2-pentanol, t-amyl alcohol, tertbutanol, 2-butanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-2-pentanol, 2-ethyl1-butanol, ethanol, 3,3dimethyl-2-butanol, decanoic acid, octanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, 1-ethoxy-2propanol, l-tert-butoxy-2-propanol, EH-5 (commercially available from Ethox Chemicals), 2, 3,6, 7tetrahydroxy-2,3,6,7-tetramethyl octane, 9-( 1 -methylethyl)-2,5,8, 1 0, 13,16hexaoxaheptadecane, 3, 5, 7, 9,1 1,13-hexamethoxy-l-tetradecanol, mixtures thereof and the like. The reactive mixture of the present invention may be cured via any known process for molding the reaction mixture in the production of contact lenses, including spincasting and static casting. Spincasting methods are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,408,429 and 3,660,545, and static casting methods are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,1 13,224 and 4,197,266. In one embodiment, the contact lenses of this invention are formed by the direct molding of the silicone hydrogels, which is economical, and enables precise control over the final shape of the hydrated lens. For this method, the reaction mixture is placed in a mold having the shape of the final desired silicone hydrogel, i.e. water-swollen polymer, and the reaction mixture is subjected to conditions whereby the monomers polymerize, to thereby produce a polymer in the approximate shape of the final desired product. After curing the lens is subjected to extraction to remove unreacted components and release the lens from the lens mold. The extraction may be done using conventional extraction fluids, such organic solvents, such as alcohols or may be extracted using aqueous solutions. Aqueous solutions are solutions which comprise water. In one embodiment the aqueous solutions of the present invention comprise at least about 30 % water, in some embodiments at least about 50% water, in some embodiments at least about 70% water and in others at least about 90 weight% water. Aqueous solutions may also include additional water soluble components such as release agents, wetting agents, slip agents, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical components, combinations thereof and the like. Release agents are compounds or mixtures of compounds which, when combined with water, decrease the time required to release a contact lens from a mold, as compared to the time required to release such a lens using an aqueous solution that does not comprise the release agent. In one embodiment the aqueous solutions comprise less than about 1 0 weight %, and in others less than about 5 weight % organic solvents such as isopropyl alcohol, and in another embodiment are free from organic solvents. In these embodiments the aqueous solutions do not require special handling, such as purification, recycling or special disposal procedures. In various embodiments, extraction can be accomplished, for example, via immersion of the lens in an aqueous solution or exposing the lens to a flow of an aqueous solution. In various embodiments, extraction can also include, for example, one or more of: heating the aqueous solution; stirring the aqueous solution; increasing the level of release aid in the aqueous solution to a level sufficient to cause release of the lens; mechanical or ultrasonic agitation of the lens; and incorporating at least one leach aid in the aqueous solution to a level sufficient to facilitate adequate removal of unreacted components from the lens. The foregoing may be conducted in batch or continuous processes, with or without the addition of heat, agitation or both. Some embodiments can also include the application of physical agitation to facilitate leach and release. For example, the lens mold part to which a lens is adhered, can be vibrated or caused to move back and forth within an aqueous solution. Other embodiments may include ultrasonic waves through the aqueous solution. These and other similar processes can provide an acceptable means of releasing the lens. As used herein, “released from a mold” means that a lens is either completely separated from the mold, or is only loosely attached so that it can be removed with mild agitation or pushed off with a swab. In the process of the present invention the conditions used include temperature less than 99°C for less than about 1 hour. The lenses may be sterilized by known means such as, but not limited to autoclaving. In addition to displaying desirable stability, the lenses of the present invention also display compatibility with the components of human tears. Human tears are complex and contain a mixture of proteins, lipids and other components which help to keep the eye lubricated. Examples of lipids classes include wax ester, cholesterolesters and cholesterol. Examples of proteins which are found in human tears include lactoferrin, lysozyme, lipocalin, serum albumin, secretory immunoglobulin A. Lipocalin is a lipid binding protein. The amount of lipocalin uptake to a contact lens has been negatively correlated to lens wettability (as measured via contact angle, such as via sessile drop), the propensity of lenses to uptake lipids from the tear film and consequently deposits on the front surface of the lens. Lenses which uptake low levels of lipocalin are therefore desirable. In one embodiment of the present invention, the lenses uptake less than about 3 pg lipocalin from a 2 mg/ml lipocalin solution over 72 hours incubation at 35 °C. Lysozyme is generally present in human tears in substantial concentrations. Lysozyme is bacteriolytic and believed to protect the eye against bacterial infection. The amount of lysozyme which associates with commercially available contact lenses varies greatly from only a few micrograms to over 800 micrograms for etafilcon A contact lenses (commercially available from Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc., under the ACUVUE and ACUVUE2 brand names). Etafilcon A contact lenses have been commercially available for many years and display some of the lowest adverse event rates of any soft contact lens. Thus, contact lenses which uptake substantial levels of lysozyme are desirable. The lenses of the present invention uptake at least about 50 pg, pg, 200 pg, 500 pg of lysozyme and in some embodiments at least about 800pg lysozyme, all from a 2 mg/ml solution over 72 hours incubation at 35°C. In addition to lysozyme, lactoferrin is another important cationic protein in the tears, mainly by the virtue of its anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Upon wear, contact lenses uptake various amounts of lactoferrin, depending upon their polymer composition (for non-surface modified lenses) and the composition and integrity of the surface coating (for surface modified contact lenses). In one embodiment of the present invention, lenses uptake at least about 5 pg, and in some embodiments, at least about micrograms lactoferrin following overnight soaking of the lenses in 2 mis of a 2 mg/ml lactoferrin solution. The lactoferrin solution contains lactoferrin from human milk (Sigma L-0520) solubilized at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in phosphate saline buffer. Lenses are incubated in 2 ml of the lactoferrin solution per lens for 72 hours at 35 °C, using the procedure described below for lipocalin and lysozyme. The form of the proteins in, on and associated with the lens is also important. Denatured proteins are believed to contribute to corneal inflammatory events and wearer discomfort. Environmental factors such as pH, ocular surface temperature, wear time and closed eye wear are believed to contribute to the denaturation of proteins. However, lenses of different compositions can display markedly different protein uptake and denaturation profiles. In one embodiment of the present invention, a majority of the proteins uptaken by the lenses of the present invention are and remain in the native form during wear. In other embodiments at least about 50%, at least about 70 and at least about 80% of uptaken proteins are and remain native after 24 hours, 3 days and during the intended wear period. In one embodiment the ophthalmic devices of the present invention also uptake less than about 20%, in some embodiments less than about 1 0%, and in other embodiments less than about 5% Polyquatemium-1 (dimethyl-bis[(E)-4-[tris(2hydroxyethyl)azaniumyl] but-2-enyl]azanium trichloride) (“PQ1”) from an ophthalmic solution containing 0.001 wt% PQ1). The lenses of the present invention have a number of desirable properties in addition to the protein uptake characteristics described herein. In one embodiment the lenses have an oxygen permeability greater than about 50 and in other embodiment greater than about 60, in other embodiments greater than about 80 and in still other embodiments at least about 100. In some embodiments the lenses have tensile moduli' less than about 100 psi. It will be appreciated that all of the tests specified herein have a certain amount of inherent test error. Accordingly, results reported herein are not to be taken as absolute numbers, but numerical ranges based upon the precision of the particular test. Modulus (tensile modulus) is measured by using the crosshead of a constant rate of movement type tensile testing machine equipped with a load cell that is lowered to the initial gauge height. A suitable testing machine includes an Instron model 1122. A dogbone shaped sample from a -1.00 power lens having a 0.522 inch length, 0.276 inch “ear” width and 0.213 inch “neck” width is loaded into the grips and elongated at a constant rate of strain of 2 in/min. until it breaks. The initial gauge length of the sample (Lo) and sample length at break (Lf) are measured. At least five specimens of each composition are measured and the average is reported. Tensile modulus is measured at the initial linear portion of the stress/strain curve. Percent elongation is = [(Lf - Lo)/Lo]x 1 00. Diameter may be measured using the modulation image generated from a MachZehnder interferometer with the lenses submersed in saline solution and mounted concave surface down in a cuvette, as further described in US2008/0151236. The lenses are equilibrated for 15 minutes at about 20°C before measurement. Water content is measured as follows. The lenses to be tested are allowed to sit in packing solution for 24 hours. Each of three test lens are removed from packing solution using a sponge tipped swab and placed on blotting wipes which have been dampened with packing solution. Both sides of the lens are contacted with the wipe. Using tweezers, the test lens are placed in a weighing pan and weighed. The two more sets of samples are prepared and weighed as above. The pan and lenses are weighed three times and the average is the wet weight. The dry weight is measured by placing the sample pans in a vacuum oven which has been preheated to 60°C for 30 minutes. Vacuum is applied until at least 0.4 inches Hg is attained. The vacuum valve and pump are turned off and the lenses are dried for four hours. The purge valve is opened and the oven is allowed reach atmospheric pressure. The pans are removed and weighed. The water content is calculated as follows: Wet weight = combined wet weight of pan and lenses - weight of weighing pan Dry weight = combined dry weight of pan and lens - weight of weighing pan % water content = (wet weight - dry weight) x wet weight The average and standard deviation of the water content are calculated for the samples are reported. Lysozyme and lipocalin uptake were measured out using the following solutions and method. The lysozyme solution contained lysozyme from chicken egg white (Sigma, L7651) solubilized at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in phosphate saline buffer supplemented by Sodium bicarbonate at 1.37g/l and D-Glucose at 0.1 g/1. The lipocalin solution contained B Lactoglobulin (Lipocalin) from bovine milk (Sigma, L3908) solubilized at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in phosphate saline buffer supplemented by Sodium bicarbonate at 1.37g/l and D-Glucose at 0.1 g/1. Three lenses for each example were tested using each protein solution, and three were tested using PBS as a control solution. The test lenses were blotted on sterile gauze to remove packing solution and aseptically transferred, using sterile forceps, into sterile, 24 well cell culture plates (one lens per well) each well containing 2 ml of lysozyme solution. Each lens was fully immersed in the solution. 2 ml of the lysozyme solution was placed in a well without a contact lens as a control. The plates containing the lenses and the control plates containing only protein solution and the lenses in the PBS, were parafilmed to prevent evaporation and dehydration, placed onto an orbital shaker and incubated at 35°C, with agitation at rpm for 72 hours. After the 72 hour incubation period the lenses were rinsed 3 to 5 times by dipping lenses into three (3) separate vials containing approximately 200 ml volume of PBS. The lenses were blotted on a paper towel to remove excess PBS solution and transferred into sterile conical tubes (1 lens per tube), each tube containing a volume of PBS determined based upon an estimate of lysozyme uptake expected based upon on each lens composition. The lysozyme concentration in each tube to be tested needs to be within the albumin standards range as described by the manufacturer (0.05 micogram to micrograms). Samples known to uptake a level of lysozyme lower than 100 pg per lens were diluted 5 times. Samples known to uptake levels of lysozyme higher than 500 pg per lens (such as etafilcon A lenses) are diluted 20 times. 1 ml aliquot of PBS was used for samples 9, CE2 and the balafilcon lenses, and 20ml for etafilcon A lens. Each control lens was identically processed, except that the well plates contained PBS instead of either lysozyme or lipocalin solution. Lysozyme and Lipocalin uptake was determined using on-lens bicinchoninic acid method using QP-BCA kit ( Sigma, QP-BCA) following the procedure described by the manufacturer (the standards prep is described in the kit) and is calculated by subtracting the optical density measured on PBS soaked lenses ( background) from the optical density determined on lenses soaked in lysozyme solution. Optical density was measured using a Synergyll Micro-plate reader capable for reading optical density at 562nm. Lysozyme activity was measured using the solution and incubation procedure described above for lysozyme uptake. After the incubation period the lenses were rinsed 3 to 5 times by dipping lenses into three (3) separate vials containing approximately 200 ml volume of PBS. The lenses were blotted on a paper towel to remove excess PBS solution and transferred into sterile, 24 well cell culture plates (one lens per well) each containing 2 ml of extraction solution composed of a 50:50 mix of 0.2% of trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile (TFA/ACN) solution. The lenses were incubated in the extraction solution for 16 hours at room temperature. In parallel, the lysozyme control solution was diluted in the extraction buffer to a range of concentrations with bracket the expected lysozyme uptake of the lenses being analyzed. For the examples of the present application the expected lysozyme concentrations were 10, 50, 100, 800 and the control solution were diluted to those concentrations and incubated for 16 hours at room temperature. The lysozyme extracts from both the lenses and the controls were assayed for lysozyme activity using EnzChek® Lysozyme Assay Kit ( invitrogen) following the instructions described by the manufacturer. The EnzChek kit is a fluorescence based assay to measure levels of lysozyme activity in solution down to 20U/ml. The test measures lysozyme activity on Micrococcus Lysodeikticus cell walls, which are labelled in such a degree that the fluorescence is quenched. Lysozyme action relieves this quenching, yielding an increase in fluorescence that is proportional to lysozyme activity. The fluorescence increase is measured using a fluorescence microplate reader that can detect fluorescein using excitation /emission weivelenghs of 494/5 1 8nm. A Synergy HT microplate reader was used in the examples of the present application. The assay is based on the preparation of lysozyme standard curve using the same lysozyme incubated with the lenses or as a control. Lysozyme activity is expressed in fluorescence units and plotted against lysozyme concentrations expressed in Units/ml. Activity of lysozyme extracted from the lenses as well as lysozyme control was measured and converted using standard curve to an activity expressed in units per ml. The percentage of active or native lysozyme is determined by comparing lysozyme activity on lenses to that in the control solution and is calculated following the formula below: % of active or native lysozyme on lens = Lysozyme (unit/ml) extracted from the lens XIOO/Lysozyme (unit per ml) obtained from control. PQ1 uptake was measured as follows. The HPLC is calibrated using a series of standard PQ1 solutions prepared having the following concentrations: 2, 4, 6, 8 ,12 and 1 5 pg/mL. Lenses were placed into polypropylene contact lens case with 3 mL of Optiffee Replenish (which contains wt% PQ1, and is commercially available from Alcon). A control lens case, containing mL of solution, but no contact lens was also prepared. The lenses and control solutions were allowed to sit at room temperature for 72 hours. 1 ml of solution was removed from each of the samples and controls and mixed with trifluoroacetic acid pL). The analysis was conducted using HPLC/ELSD and a Phenomenex Luna C4 mm x mm; pm particle size) column and the following conditions Instrument: Agilent HPLC or equivalent with Sedere Sedex 85 ELSD Sedex 85 ELSD: 60°C, Gain Pressure = 3.4 bar, Filter = Is Mobile Phase A: H20 TFA) Mobile Phase B: Acetonitrile TFA) Column Temperature: °C Injection Volume: pL Table HPLC Conditions. Time (minutes) %A %B Flow Rate (mL/min) 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 Three lenses were run for each analysis, and the results were averaged. Oxygen permeability (Dk) was determined by the polarographic method generally described in 1996(E), but with the following variations. The measurement is conducted at an environment containing 2.1% oxygen. This environment is created by equipping the test chamber with nitrogen and air inputs set at the appropriate ratio, for example 1 ml/min of nitrogen and ml/min of air. The t/Dk is calculated using the adjusted oxygen concentration. Borate buffered saline was used. The dark current was measured by using a pure humidified nitrogen environment instead of applying MMA lenses. The lenses were not blotted before measuring. Four lenses were stacked instead of using lenses of varied thickness. A curved sensor was used in place of a flat sensor. The resulting Dk value is reported in barrers. These examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a method of practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable in contact lenses as well as other specialties may find other methods of practicing the invention. However, those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.

Stability Evaluation Lenses from Examples 1-4 and Comparative Example 1 were placed in a chamber with temperature controlled at 55°C. Lenses were pulled from the chamber at established intervals, and tested for modulus, maximum strain and diameter (for Examples 1-3, lenses were pulled at each time point for measurement as follows: 8-10 lenses for diameter measurement, 9 lenses for %H20 and lenses for mechanical property testing; for Example 4, 5 lenses were pulled at each time point as follows: 5 lenses for diameter testing, 9 lenses for %H20 and 5 lenses for mechanical properties). The stability data from Examples 1-4 is shown in Figure 1. In addition, stability data from lenses made according to Comparative Example below, which had no ionic component, are also included as a non-ionic control. The modulus of the lenses was measured at various time intervals and is reported in Tables 2 and 3.

The lines for the comparative Example and Example 4 are very flat, due to the small changes in modulus over the time periods measured. As the concentration of methacrylic acid and mole product increases, the slope of the line also increases, with a substantial increase between Examplel (having a concentration of 1 wt% methacrylic acid and a stability product of 0.0017) and Example 3, having a concentration of 1.6 wt % methacrylic acid and a mole product of 0.0024. The changes in lens diameter and strain provide additional confirmation of trends observed in the modulus. Figure 1 clearly shows the relationship between hydrolytic stability of lenses, and the mole product of anionic group (carboxylate) and TMS silicon content. Only moles of silicon (Si) derived from trimethylsilyl-containing monomers (TRIS or SIMAA2) were used in the calculation of the mole product listed in Tables 2 and 3. From these experiments it was surprisingly found that the stability of silicone hydrogel lenses comprising a silicone component having at least one TMS group and at least one anionic component, such as methacrylic acid, display a sharp drop in stability above a certain concentration of the anionic component. Thus, Examples 1 and 2 have substantially similar stability even though the Example 1 contains twice as much methacrylic acid (1%) than Example 2 (0.5%). However, the stability of the lenses made in Example 3 were much worse than Examples 2 and 3. This result was unexpected, and provides a small formulating window for including anionic components and silicone components comprising at least one TMS group. The inclusion of TMS containing silicone monomer components in amounts that provide the recited stability products provides the ability to balance stability with other properties, such as a desired modulus, elongation or tan delta. The stability products, methacrylic acid concentrations and % change in modulus are shown in Table 8, below. Comparative Example 1 The reactive monomer mixture listed in Table 1 under CE 1 was dosed into Zeonor front curves, and the molds were closed using Zeonor back curves. The lenses were cured under visible light in a nitrogen atmosphere. Cure profile: 1) Pre-cure (TLDK-30W/03 bulbs, 30-120 sec, 60-80°C); 2) Cure (TLD-30W/03 bulbs, 320-800 sec, 70-80 °C). The molds were opened, and the lenses released were extracted and hydrated in IPA/water mixtures. The finished lenses were packaged in borate buffered saline. Example A monomer mixture was formed by mixing the components in the amounts listed in Table 4. The monomer mixes were dispensed into Zeonor front and Zeonor:Polypropylene (55:45) back curves. The molds were closed and the filled, closed monomers were held at 65°C with no irradiation. The monomer mixtures were cured under visible light (Philips TL-03 bulbs) at 65°C in a nitrogen atmosphere (about 3 % O2) using the following cure profile: 1.5 mW/cm2 for about 330 seconds, 7 ± 01 mW/cm2 for about 440 seconds. After curing, the molds were opened, and the lenses released in 70% IPA in DI water. After about 60-70 minutes the lenses were transferred into: i) 70% IPA in DI water for about 30-40 minutes; ii) 70% IPA in DI water for about 30-40 minutes; and iii) DI water for at least about 30 minutes.

The modulus change noted for Comparative Example 1 illustrates that modulus can vary by as much as 10% without an anionic component. This is also shown by the standard deviations noted in Tables 2 and 3. The change in modulus reported for Examples 6 and 7 are reported as negative values because the modulus was slightly lower after 1 0 and 20 weeks. However, the changes are within the standard deviation for the modulus test method, and should be considered as representing no change. Table 8 also shows that the best results were achieved in formulations which did not have any silicone monomers having TMS group(s) as a component in the reaction mixture (Example 4, which had mPDMS and macromer, and Examples 5-7 which had HO-mPDMS). The Examples which had PDMS-type silicone as the only silicone (Examples 5-7) displayed the best stability. Example 8 To a stirred solution of 45.5 kg of 3-allyloxy-2-hydroxypropane methacrylate (AHM) and 3.4 g of butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) was added 10 ml of Pt (0) divinyltetramethyldisiloxane solution in xylenes (2.25 %Pt concentration) followed by addition of 44.9 kg of n-butylpolydimethylsilane. The reaction exotherm was controlled to maintain reaction temperature of about 20°C. After complete consumption of nbutylpolydimethylsilane, the Pt catalyst was deactivated by addition of 6.9 g of diethylethylenediamine. The crude reaction mixture was extracted several times with 181kg of ethylene glycol until residual AHM content of the raffinate was <0.1 %. 10 g of BHT was added to the resulting raffinate, stirred until dissolution, followed by removal of residual ethylene glycol affording 64.5 kg of the OH-mPDMS. 6.45 g of 4-Methoxy phenol (MeHQ) was added to the resulting liquid, stirred, and filtered yielding 64.39 kg of final OH-mPDMS as colorless oil. Example 9 and Comparative Example 2 The components listed in Table 9, (except PVP K90) were mixed in ajar for at least 1 hour with stirring. The PVP K90 was slowly added to the reactive mixture with stirring such that no clumps were formed during the addition. After all the PVP had been added the reactive mixture was stirred for an additional 30 minutes. The jar was sealed and put on ajar roller running at ~200 rpm over night. The reactive mixture was degassed in a vacuum desiccator (around 1cm Hg pressure) for about 40 minutes. The plastic lens molds and monomer dosing syringes were put in a N2 environment (<2% 02) for at least 12 hours. The back curve mold was made of 9544 polypropylene, and the front curve mold was made of Zeonor™. The reactive mixture (50 microliter) was dosed into each FC curve, and then BC curve was slowly deposited to close the molds. This process was carried out under N2 environment (<2% 02). The monomer mixtures were cured under visible light (Philips TLK 40W/03 bulbs) in a nitrogen atmosphere (about <2 % O2) using the following cure profile: 5 ± 0.5 mW/cm2 for about 10 minutes at about 50 ± 5 °C. The base curve was the removed from the assembly by prying. The lens remained with the front curve and the front curve was press-inverted to separate the dry lens from the front curve. The dry lenses were inspected. Passed lenses were packaged in blister with 950ul borate buffered packing solution with 50ppm methyl ethyl cellulose for each lens. The lens was then sterilized at 12 1°C for 18 minutes Table 9 Component Wt% Ex. 9 CE HO-mPDMS TEGDMA 0.25 DMA 16.78 HEMA 12.5 MAA 1.5 PVP K-90 CGI 819 0.25 Norbloc 1.7 Blue HEMA 0.02 Lysozyme and lipocalin uptake were measured as described above. Lysozyme is a hydrolytic enzyme able to cleave the cell wall of gram positive and some gram negative bacteria. Cleavage of the peptidoglycan wall at the Bl-4 linkage between N-acetyl-glucosamine and N acetyl galactosamine (muramate) results in lysis of the bacteria. Lysozyme activity was measured to determine the capacity of lenses to maintain this protein in its native state. The level of native lysozyme corresponds to the level of active lysozyme determined following the procedure described above. The results are shown in Table Table Ex.# [ion] wt% [ion]* Lysozyme (Pg) Lipocalin (Pg) % Native lysozyme PQ1 uptake 1.5 0.017 103+5 4.6±0.4 60±7.7 CE 2 6.6±0.3 6.5±0.6 30±3 Balafilcon A 0.006 46±6 7. 8+0.5 37+8.3 Etafilcon A 1.98 0.023 843±23 1.8+0.2 80±11 * Moles/ 100 gram of reactive components Balafilcon A is the lens material used to make Purevision® lenses commercially available from Bausch & Lomb Etafilcon A is the lens material used to make ACUVUE® AND ACUVUE®2 lenses commercially available from Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. Preservatives uptake from lens care solutions can impact contact lens performance, particularly contact lens induced corneal staining. Preservative uptake of the lenses of Example 9, Comparative Example 2, and Purevision was measured by incubating the above lenses in 3 ml of OptiFree® RepleniSH® for 72 hours at room temperature using the procedure described above to lysozyme and lipocalin uptake. OptiFree® RepleniSH® contains 0.001 wt% PQ1 as a disinfectant/preservative and citrate dihydrate and citric acid monohydrate concentrations are 0.56% and 0.021% (wt/wt). The quantity of PQ1 uptake was determined using HPLC analysis by comparing the level of PQ1 in the initial soak solution to the level of PQ1 after 72h soak in presence of the test contact lens. The results are shown in Table Examples 10-18 & Comparative Example 2 Formulations were made as in Example 9, but varying the concentration of methacrylic acid as shown in Table 11, below.
