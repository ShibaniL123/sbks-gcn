This invention relates to thermoplastic sheet materisl having a terrazzo or other variegated aspect, The matorinl is primarily iutended for use as a floor-covering, but may also be used on walls, counter and tabletops aud elsewhere as a rface coving, According to the present invention, a thermoplastic sheet material having a terrazzo or other variegated aspect comprises a conglomeration or aggltm eratinn of pieces of thermoplastic material a substantial number of which each exhibit two or more co]ours or shades of the same colour in a stratified manner. Also in accordance with the present invention a method for the production of a thermoplastic sheet mateTiaI having a terrazzo or other variegated asI> ct comprises assembling and moulding variegated chipIPings of the thermoplastic material to form a compo- te sheet material. The extruded thermoplastic material may suitably be obtained by extruding a mixture of diffidently eoloured but otherwise conventionally compounded and produced thermoplastic chippings through a fiat or circular die. The cinppings may. for instance, be ote rained by comp<Junding pigmented thermop[astlc com. positions in accordance with the normal practice of the industry aud subjecting the compositions to conventional milling, calendering, and granulating operations. The cinppings may be fed to the extruder one colour at a time, or in the form of a mixture, in coder to produce the desired hecerogeneJty and colour d]stincnon in th'e extruded material. Further variations in the eolour balance of the extrudate may be brought about by adjusting the proportion of chippings of each ealour in the mixture fed to the extruder, or by using einppings derived from thermoplastic compositions With different relative viscosities. The chippings may be supplemented by ingh-speed-bteuded powder con prlsing thermoplastic material of one of the desired coinurs. The design of the extruder also plays a part in producing the desired heterogeneity in the variegated extrudaCe, and the extruder sh atd preferably have a low compression ratio and a screw length : diameter ratio within the range 1O:l to 29:t, The use of a relatively short screw ensures that overmiatng, and eorresDondthg ]os of contrast in the excruciate, do not Occur. The extruder should preinrainy be provided with a die of such a size es to produce an extrudate having a thickhess within the range 9.015 to 0.2 inches. If desired, about 0.019 inches may be sanded off from the top and/ or bottc>m of the sheet to give further variations in the decorative effect. The extruded sheet material is preferably chipped when cold, to reduce the risk of the cinppings sticking one to another. The cinppin s formed may he strewer to a substantially uniform thickness on a monad, or on a base sheet, winch may or may not be removable after mantling (in the intler case the base sheet may suitably comprise a sheet of resin-bound paper or asbestos felt, which may or may net be coated with a suitable edbealve, or again a sheet of a innyl resin composition). Mouldteg may be carried out clthef batcher or continuously, using methods well-known in the therrf plastic industry. However, lu the productiou of tiles, the methods of moulding described in our Indian patent • "pccifications NOS 89669 and 99699 are particularly suitable. The chippings may also be embedded in a compatible thermoplastic mortar or matrix, e.g. as descrihd in our co-pending Indiau patent application i'4o. 94249, so that the finished sheet material has the appearance of a canginmerate. This tatter method ascertains the nature ol this inventinn and the manner to be performed. particularly suitable for the production of a covering material having an overall tessellated appearance. The moulded variegated or t razzo sheet material may he provided With a transparent protecting :[acing layer, suitably of a clear polyvinyl chloride composition, such that the fiuished comlx tie sheeting possesses enhanced resistance to wear, and/or solvent attack, :[or instance, Generally and thermoplastic material may Le used in a method according to the invention though the vinyl thloride polymer or copolymer compositions familiar in the thermoplastic flooring industry are preferred. Suitable comresitions may for instance comprise the polymers ana co1 lymers of vinyl cinoride, viny]idene cinoride, and vinyl acetate, and mixture thereof, as wen a other resin of this class and their equivalents either ainne or in various combinations, The thermoplastic ¢ompesitions from which the variegated or Cerrazzo- haeting is derived will niJrmally include :[he vinyl resin. a p]aaticiser for the resin, a filler, a stabinser, a lubricant and pigment material. The slriinng and unusual decorative effee of the terrazzo sheeting of the invention is due to the. stralillcation of the differenUy co]oure4 compositions present in tim cinppings from which the sheeting is fabricated and is brought about by the extrusion process des= cstbed above, The variegated extruded sheet material exhibits tbe dllferent]y coinured compositions from which it Is derived in a characteristic stratiflrd manner, in which the coteurs appear in successive strata in a uonregalar manner, each colour appearance generully more than once, and the extruded sheet appears to have a multi-layer appearance especially when viewed end-on, Clearly the method of the invention is capable of being Implemented by a wide variety of specific techniques, in oue of winch, for instance, chippings derived from two or more dJffereutly coinured variegated sheets are mixed and the assembly moulded to forth a sheeting having a matti-culoured variegated or terr* azzo appearance. Als :[he shape and size of the cinpl ings may be varied within extremely Wide limits, for instance the chippings may be square in outline such that the composite sheeting is glven a tessellated aPpearance, or the shippings may be of other configurations such as triangles, rectangles, circular discs, or a combination of tbese r other regular or non-regular geometrical shapes, Further variations in the decorative effect obtained nmy be brought about by mixing the cinppthgs derived from the extruded variegated sheet material With cinpphigs derived from other sources For example, the edditinual cinpI mgs may be derived from a plain sheet of thermoplastic material, or from a sheet of thermoplastic in which metallic or opaleScent pigments have been incorporated.
