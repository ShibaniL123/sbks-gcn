Hybrid material for optoelectronic applications The invention relates to the field of light emitting diode (LED) technology. Especially the invention relates to a hybrid material useful as an LED encapsulation material. The invention further relates to the field of organopolysilazanes that can be used as an encapsulating material for LEDs. There is a high demand in the electronic industry to find suitable encapsulating polymer materials for LEDs. Such materials face - inter alia - the challenge that the polymer needs to have, in addition to optical clarity and high temperature service, the advantageous property of a high refractive index. Until now, no polymers have been reported with a high refractive index (over 1 .52) and high transparency accompanied by resistance to yellowing induced by thermal degrdn. above 150 °C aging in air. Phenyl hybrids have a refractive index about 1 .56 with bad thermal stability against discoloration to yellow by aging even at 160 °C, which is a key factor for the long lifetime of a LED encapsulant. According to the thesis "Synthesis and characterization of high-breaking hybrid materials for optical applications" by David Dusselberg commercial optical polymers like polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polycarbonate (PC) or polysulfon (PSU) have a refractive index in the area of 1 .49 to 1 .63 and lack thermal stability. A thermal stability for up to 200°C is necessary for LED applications. The refractive index is influenced by the chemical structure of the polymers. The density of the material plays a major role. The higher the density of a material the higher is the refractive index. Aromatic structures like e.g. phenyls or heteroatoms like sulfur are able to increase the refractive index in the polymer. Such polymers as e.g. polyetheretherketones have a refractive index of 1 .71 but are not transparent - but in this case grey - as necessary for optical applications as LED application. Polyimides are highly chemically and mechanically stable. Sulfur containing polyimides can reach more than nD > 1 .7 but are yellow which is of poor use for LED applications. Conventional polymers are not able to reach refractive indexes of above 1 .8. To increase the refractive index further, one needs to combine the properties of organic polymers with inorganic materials. Inorganic materials as titaniumdioxide and zirconiumdioxide have a refractive index in the area of 2.2-2.7. Such materials containing an organic and inorganic component are called hybrid materials. It is known that such inorganic nanoparticles of e.g.TiO2-rutil (nD=2.7) can be used as fillers in polymers to increase their refractive index (Yoshida et al., Journal of Material Science, 1997, 32, 4047-4051 and US-patent 6,912,092 B2, 2005 by Ukuda). Depending on the loading the refractive index could be increased. The challenge is to avoid agglomeration during dispersion of the nanoparticles. The higher the amount of nanoparticles in the hybrid material the higher is the risk of agglomeration. Agglomeration is a problem because if the hybrid material is not homogeneous its appearance will turn opaque. Opaque materials are of poor use for optical applications as LED purposes. EP 2 592 056 A1 discloses that coatings for glass or glass ceramics can include an organic, inorganic, polysiloxane and/or silazane based matrix. LED displays are mentioned as potential applications. JP 2013 019041 (A) discloses a zinc oxide film containing polysilazane.

US 201 1/0240931 (A) describes a nanoparticle-resin composition comprising a nanoparticle, a silicone resin, a silane compound and a silazane compound. Specific silazane compounds are mentioned as well as nanoparticles and the application for LEDs. US 2012/0256223 A1 discloses a coating for LED application consisting of polysilazane, fine particles and phosphors. The coating requires heating up to 700°C which turns the polysilazane to a ceramics. US 2012/0018761 A1 describes phosphor members for an LED light including phosphor particles and an inorganic layer which comprises a polysiloxane bond.

No details are given about the chemistry of the polysilazane. KR-B 10-1238738 discloses organopolysilazanes as encapsulation material for LEDs. Inorganic nanoparticles are not disclosed in this document. WO 2012/067766 discloses LEDs comprising a bonding layer containing an organopolysilazane. The bonding layer may further comprise inorganic nanoparticles. LEDs can generate both high thermal flux and high optical flux. The LED package as well as the encapsulation material need to perform stably when exposed to heat and/or radiation (ultra-violet and/or visible radiation). The right encapsulation material plays a major role in improving LED performance. So far many encapsulation materials suffer from among other loss of transmittance during the lifetime of usage of the LED. It has now been found that specific organopolysilazanes in combination with specific surface modified inorganic nanoparticles are useful as high refractive index encapsulation materials for light emitting diodes. Surprisingly, such materials show a lower CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) compared to non-modified polysilazane materials and the refractive index does not change if the hybrid material is exposed to higher temperature and humidity conditions which can cause hydrolysis of polysilazane to polysiloxane.

Further, the synthesis of these materials is well known to those skilled in the art and usually is carried out by reacting dichlorosilanes with ammonia according to the following equation: n R1R2SiCI2 + 3n NH3→ [-SiR1R2-NH-]n + 2n NH4CI It is described in a multitude of patents, e.g. US 4,395,460, US 2,264,674, US 4,954, 596 and US 6,329,487. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the organopolysilazane material is subjected to a pre-crosslinking treatment before being applied to the LED. In this way, the amount of low molecular weight material is reduced, which leads to a reduced loss of material due to evaporation in the final curing step. Several methods have been described for such a crosslinking, e.g. in US 6,329,487. Further crosslinking by the reaction with isocyanates (J. Schwank, Mat. Res. Soc. Syn. Proc 271 (1992) 807) or the introduction of boron bridges (EP-A 0 389 084) has been reported. In a preferred embodiment of the invention an organopolysilazane material of the invention is produced by a process, comprising the step of reacting an organopolysilazane, comprising structural units of the following formula, [-SiHR-NH-] wherein R is an organic group bonded through carbon, with a base catalyst in order to form a crosslinked product. Crosslinking of organopolysilazanes comprising N-H and SiH bonds can be effected by the catalytic action of various basic compounds with a base strength strong enough to activate the N-H group of the organosilazane. Suitable Bases are for example strong tertiary amines, amides of the type R1R2NM, with R1 and R2 being independently hydrogen or an organic moiety and M being an cationic counterion like alkali or earth alkali or an organometallic base like butyl-lithium or Grignard compounds. The catalytic crosslinking reaction has to be performed in a non-reactive solvent at a suitable temperature to avoid a too vigorous or too slow reaction. A variety of basic compounds with a base strength strong enough to activate the N-H group of the organosilaznes can be used as catalyst. For example strong tertiary amines R3N like 1 .8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene or 1 .5-diaza- bicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene are possible. Other types of base catalysts are amides of the general formula RaRbNM with Ra and Rb independently hydrogen or an organic moiety and M a cationic counterion like alkali or earthalkali. Examples are NaNH2, Ca(NH2)2, LiN(i-C3H7)2 and KN(SiMe3)2. Hydrides like NaH, CaH2, LiAIH4 or KH are possible too. Other types of base catalysts are organometallic base like for example butyl-Lithium or Grignard compounds like alkyl- or aryl-magnesium- bromides. The catalytic crosslinking reaction has to be performed in a solvent inert under strong alkaline conditions and non-reactive with the organosilazane and especially the Si-H groups. Useful solvents are alkanes, ethers and aromatic compounds. Examples of useful solvents are n-heptane, cyclohexane, THF, 1 .4- dioxane, di-propylether, toluene and xylene. The reaction has to be performed at a suitable temperature to avoid a too vigorous or too slow reaction. Typical reaction temperatures are in the range of -20°C up to +100°C. It is important to select the correct combination of catalyst, solvent and temperature to ensure smooth reaction and an appropriate degree of crosslinking. Mw is determined by GPC against a polystyrene standard. Preferred GPC conditions are the following: the eluent is a mixture of THF and 1 .45 weight% hexamethyldisilazane, the columns are Shodex KS-804 and 2 x KS- 802 and KS-801 and the detector is Agilent 1260 Refractive Index Detector. The calibration is done with polystyrene standards. Viscosity is determined by using the following equipment and conditions: Brookfield Rheometer R/S plus, Brookfield cone-type spindle RC3-50-1 , rotation speed of 3 rpm, Temperature 25°C. Preferably the amount of low molecular weight material (Mw < 500g/mol) in organopolysilazane material is below 15 wt.-%, more preferably < 10 wt.-%, particularly preferably < 8 wt.-%. Further, the amount of low molecular weight material with an Mw < 1000 g/mol is preferably below 40 wt.-%, more preferably <30 wt.-%, particularly preferably < 25 wt.-%. The amount of low molecular weight material can be reduced e.g. by the reaction conditions of the polycondensation reaction, by purification of the organo- polysilazanes, and, preferably, by the above described crosslinking reaction. Component b) of the hybrid material consists of one or more types of inorganic nanoparticles with a mean diameter in the range of from 1 to 30 nm, preferably 3 to 20 nm. The mean diameter is measured by dynamic light scattering of the dispersed nanoparticles using a MALVERN Zetasizer Nano Z working at a wavelength of 633 nm The refractive index of the inorganic nanoparticles is generally in the range of from 1 .50 to 3.00, preferably from 1 .75 to 2.75, more preferred 2.00 to 2.20. The nanoparticles may be selected from semiconductor nanoparticles, a metal nanoparticles, a metal oxide nanoparticles, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. The semiconductor nanoparticles may be selected from a group ll-VI compound, a group lll-V compound, a group IV-VI compound, a group IV compound, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. Other suitable inorganic nanoparticles may include ceramics or wide bandgap semiconductors such as Si3N4, diamond, ZnS and SiC. The metal nanoparticles may be selected from palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. Preferably the inorganic nanoparticles are selected from the group of metal oxide nanoparticles which include oxides of a metal selected from silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), aluminium (Al), zinc (Zn), indium (In), zirconium (Zr), nickel (Ni), hafnium (Hf), vanadium (V), or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. More preferred nanoparticles are ZrO2 (n = 2.2), TiO2 (n = 2.5 Rutil or 3.1 Anatas), SnO2 (n = 2.0), CeO2 (n = 2.3), BaTiO3 (n = 2.4) and AI2O3, (n = 1 .77), and most preferred ZrO2, TiO2 and BaTiO3. Suitable inorganic particles are substantially nonabsorbing over the spectral bandwidth of the emission LED and the emission of the wavelength converter layer. The size and density of the particles can be selected to achieve desired levels of transmission and scattering. The inorganic nanoparticles are surface treated to promote their uniform dispersion in the bonding material. To ensure the compatibility of the nanoparticles with various dispersing solvents and with the polymer matrix and to prevent nanoparticle aggregation, it is necessary to protect the surface of the nanoparticles. Another purpose of the surface protection is to provide additional functionalities to the nanoparticles like for example double bonds to impart reactivity with acrylic resins or amine groups to impart reactivity with epoxy resins. Typical agents to protect the nanoparticle surface (sometimes such agents are called "surface ligands", "capping agents" or "coating agents") are organosilanes, organic amines, organic thiols, organic alcohols, trialkyl phosphines, organic carboxylic acids, organic phosphonic acids, inorganic phosphonic acids, zirconates, titanates or any other surfactants-like molecule able to absorb on or react with the surface. Organosilanes are a common class of organic compounds used to protect the surface of oxide nanoparticles. These organosilanes are typically composed of a reactive and a non reactive part. The reactive part of the organosilane is typically either a trialkoxysilane group, a monoalkoxysilane group or a trichlorosilane group, although bi substituted alkoxy and bi and mono substituted chlorosilanes are possible too. The reactive group anchors to the oxide through a covalent bond with the hydroxide group or the -OR group where in R is an alkyl or aryl group present at the surface eliminating alcohol, alkyl chloride, water or HCI as a byproduct. The non reactive part of the organosilane can include one or more of an alkyl chain of various chain length, one or more of a cyclic alkyl group of various chain length, fluorinated alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, epoxy groups, aryl groups, ether groups, amines, thioles or carboxylic acids. The organosilanes have the general structure RaSi(OR')b with a = 1 , 2 or 3, b = 4 - a, R and R' are organic residues with R' being preferably methyl, ethyl, n- or iso-propyl and n- or iso-butyl.

Other classes of organic compounds used as capping agents to passivate a oxide nanomaterial are carboxylic acids and alcohols. The head of an carboxyl acid is - COOH and the head of an alcohol is -OH. The head anchors to the surface of the oxide through a covalent bond with the hydroxy group (-OH) or the -OR (R = alkyl or aryl) group present at the surface eliminating an alcohol or water as byproduct.

The inorganic nanopartides of the invention are preferably monodisperse. In a preferred embodiment the amount of particles with a diameter of > 20 nm is < 10.0 % by weight, the amount of particles with a diameter of >30 nm is < 1 .0 % by weight, and the amount of particles with a diameter > 50 nm is < 0.1 % by weight. The distribution is determined by dynamic light scattering of the dispersed nanopartides using a MALVERN Zetasizer Nano Z working at a wavelength of 633 nm. The hybrid material of the invention can be produced in accordance with the methods disclosed in US 2012/0088845. In one embodiment the organopolysilazane material is dissolved in a suitable solvent, generally a dipolar aprotic solvent such as e.g. THF and mixed with a dispersion of the inorganic nanopartides in a suitable solvent, such as an alkylated aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g. toluene. The solvent is then removed, generally by distillation, and the crude product optionally dried in vacuo. The amount of inorganic nanopartides in the hybrid material is generally in the range of from 1 to 90%, preferably 10 to 90%, more preferred 10 to 80 % by weight. A further constituent of the hybrid material may be additives, which, for example, influence formulation viscosity, substrate wetting, film formation, or evaporation behavior. In a further embodiment the hybrid material contains up to 10 % by weight of further inorganic fillers. The hybrid material can include up to 60 % by weight converters, adhesion promotors and/or softening agents. In order to produce a mixture of the hybrid material with additives, generally the components are dissolved or dispersed in a solvent or solvent mixture. The solvent is then removed e.g. by distillation. Suitable solvents are e.g. non-polar or polar non-protic solvents like ethers, cyclic ethers, esters e.g. THF or PGMEA, or aromatic solvents like toluene or alkanes and cycloalkanes like heptane or cyclohexane. The invention further provides a process in which an LED is encapsulated with a hybrid material of the invention, comprising the steps of dispensing and curing of the hybrid material. In a first step the hybrid material of the invention, which has preferably been pre- crosslinked as described above, is applied to an LED or its precursor materials, e.g. with an industrial available dispensing system. In a preferred embodiment, the hybrid material of the invention is applied to the LED as such, i.e. without further dilution. Suitable organopolysilazanes for that kind of application are e.g. characterized by a viscosity range of 100 to 100,000 mPas at a temperature of 25°C. Viscosity is determined by using the following equipment and conditions: Brookfield Rheometer R/S plus, Brookfield cone-type spindle RC3-50-1 , rotation speed of 3 rpm., Temperature 25°C. To adjust the viscosity, the temperature during the dispensing process can be varied, generally between 10°C and 60°C. In a further aspect of the invention the hybrid material is applied in a solution to form thin coatings. In this embodiment, the hybrid material, which has preferably been pre-crossl inked as described above, is applied to the LED or its precursor materials in diluted form. Suitable solvents are: solvents that are non-reactive with the organosilazane, especially the Si-H group, and the inorganic nanoparticles at least at short term contact under ambient conditions. Useful solvents are for example (cyclo)alkanes, ethers, esters and aromatic compounds. Examples of useful solvents are n- heptane, cyclohexane, THF, 1 .4-dioxane, di-(iso)propylether, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, toluene and xylene. After dispensing the hybrid material to the unfinished LED, the material is subjected to a curing process. During this process the liquid and/or oil type material is transformed into a solid material. The mechanical properties of the solid material can be controlled from soft rubber-like to hard glass-like, depending on the chemistry of the organopolysilazane. The curing process is triggered by radiation or heat or crosslinking catalysts, or a combination of heat and cross- linking catalyst or radiation and a crosslinking catalyst. In case of thermal curing, the material is cured for 1 min to 6 hours, preferably 30 min to 5 h, more preferred 3 to 4h, in particular about 4h, at a temperature of from 80 to 220 °C, preferably 1 10 to 170 °C, more preferred of from 120 to 160 °C, in an inert atmosphere or air, preferably an inert, more preferably nitrogen atmosphere. In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, a heating step is carried out before the actual curing, by heating the LED device with the hybrid material to a temperature of from 60 to 70°C for 30min to 4h for degasing purposes. This process can be carried out under vacuum. The curing is a result of the crosslinking of the Si-vinyl groups with Si-H. Nanoparticles modified with alkenyl groups can also take part in the curing process. This addition reaction is triggered by simple heating, by applying a high energy radiation, or by a radical reaction caused by a radical generating catalyst (e.g. peroxyde or azo-compound) activated by heat or radiation or by a metal catalyst (e.g. Pt- or Pd-compounds). It is readily understood by those skilled in the art that in the curing step, in particular in an oxygen containing atmosphere, such as an ambient atmosphere, or especially during the lifetime of the LED, where the LED encapsulant is exposed to air at higher operating temperatures up to 120°C in combination with intensive light radiation, a certain amount of the -SiR2-NH moieties in the organopolysilazane material is converted to Si-O groups. However, in the cured hybrid material, i.e. the encapsulation material of the invention the majority of the S1 R2-NH groups is maintained, typically >80%, preferably >85%, more preferred >90% (by FTIR). Typically only the surface of the encapsulant - which is in direct contact with oxygen of the atmosphere - is slightly oxidised. FT-IR spectra of the surface and the material 500μηη below the surface show only a small amount Si-O signals at the surface. The major signals of the Si- N, Si-H and N-H groups still remain unchanged, which proofs that only a minor oxidation takes place. The FT-IR of the material 500μηη below the surface shows almost unchanged polysilazane. The hybrid material of the invention can be cured at high temperatures in a very short time, thus ensuring sufficient curing in the drying section. Since polysilazanes and nanoparticles show great temperature stability, a higher curing temperature is possible than in the case of conventional coating systems, such as e. g. epoxy resins. The only limits on this temperature are generally those imposed by the thermal deformability of the LED material. Curing of the hybrid material of the invention in the encapsulation process takes place preferably at an [oven] temperature of 90°C to 200 °C, preferably 1 10°C to 170°C, more preferably 120°C to 160°C. The drying time is usually 2 to 10 hours, preferably 4 to 6 hours, depending on the thickness of the material. The encapsulating material obtained by curing the organopolysilazane material of the invention is new. The cured encapsulation material of the invention is obtainable by a) providing the encapsulation material of the invention, b) optionally crosslinking the encapsulation material of the invention by treatment with a base, and c) curing the encapsulation material of the invention by heating it to a temperature of from 80°C to 220°C for a period of from 1 min to 6 h in an inert atmosphere or air. The encapsulation material of the invention can be used as an insulating transparent filling material for light emitting diodes (LED). The encapsulant is highly transparent in UV and visible (typically 99% at 400 nm in 1 mm path). The material shows thermal stability that means the transmission is still at least 90% at 400nm after exposure to 150°C for 6 hours in nitrogen. The encapsulant shows resistance to UV radiation, i.e., the transmission is typically 98% after exposure to UV-A light (315-400nm) for 6 hours. The encapsulant has a refraction index of 1 .35 or higher, typically of from 1 .40 to 2.50, preferably 1 .45 to 2.00. The encapsulation material for LEDs according to the invention can be used in a variety of LED devices such as high brightness light emitting diodes (HBLEDs), vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), laser diodes, flat panel displays, projection display optics components, injection-moldable optical lenses and other optical parts, devices and structures. It can be further used as part of photo semiconductor devices mounted with blue or white LED elements. LEDs comprising the encapsulation material of the invention can be used for backlights for liquid crystal displays, traffic lights, outdoor big displays, advertisement sign boards and the like. In a further embodiment, the invention provides an LED comprising the encapsulation material of the invention. A typical LED package according to the invention comprises an LED chip, and/or a lead frame and/or gold wire and/or solder (flip chip) and/or the filling material, converter, the encapsulation material of the invention and a primary and secondary optic. The encapsulation material has the function of a surface protection material against external environmental influences and guarantees long term reliability in particular aging stability. For example, in accordance with the present invention a light emitting diode is constructed similarly to the ones described in US 6,274,924 and 6,204,523. In a preferred embodiment, a light emitting diode (LED) component is provided comprising: an LED chip emitting light having a wavelength in a range of 200 to 570 nanometers; and a package including an optic encasing the LED chip, the optic comprising an encapsulation material of the invention being transmissive to light in a wavelength range from ultraviolet through green, wherein the organopolysilazane material of the invention maintains its transmissiveness when exposed to a temperature of 100 °C; and a light-emitting substance, embedded in the encapsulation material, the light-emitting substance emitting light responsive to excitation by light of a predetermined wavelength, wherein the light emitted by the light emitting substance has a peak wavelength greater than the peak wavelength of light emitted by the LED chip. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples without limiting it thereto. Examples Synthesis Examples The following example shows the synthesis of an organopolysilazane material of the invention by base catalyzed crosslinking of the organosilazanes ML-33 and HTT-1800 available from AZ Electronic Materials Germany GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany. Example A (Synthesis of Organopolysilazane) A 250 ml flask was purged with dry nitrogen and charged with 16,7g HTT-1800, 33.3g ML-33 and 100g 1 .4-Dioxane. After cooling down to 0°C 0.5g of potassium- hexamethyldisilazane were added. After addition of the catalyst, gas formation could be observed. The mixture was stirred for 2h at 0°C and for additional 2h at 20°C. Then 0.5g chlorotrimethylsilane were added. The precipitate was removed by filtration and all of the solvent was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. Yield: 47g of a colorless viscous oil. Examples B - E (Synthesis of Dispersions of Inorganic Nanoparticles) Example B (Synthesis of ZrO2 Dispersions) The zirconium dioxide dispersion in toluene with a mean particle size of < 10 nm was made of watery ZrO2 dispersions available from NYACOL. For this aim, the watery ZrO2 dispersions were first diluted with methanol, then methyl- trimethoxysilane was added, then they were stirred at 60°C for 6 h and finally the solvent was replaced with toluene by distillation. Example C (Synthesis of ΤΊΟ2 Dispersions) The titanium dioxide dispersions in toluene with a mean particle size of ca. 10 nm and ca. 25 nm were made from isopropanolic T1O2 dispersions available from Lotus-Synthesis or Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. For this aim, first methyl- trimethoxysilane was added to the isopropanolic T1O2 dispersions, then these were stirred at 60°C for 6 h and subsequently the solvent was replaced with toluene by distillation. Example D (Synthesis of S1O2 Dispersions) The silicon dioxide dispersions in toluene with a mean particle size of from 15 nm to 85 nm were made from aqueous S1O2 dispersions (KLEBOSOL), available from AZ Electronic Materials. For this aim, first the aqueous SiO2 dispersions were diluted with n-propanol, the methyl-trimethyloxysilane was added, then the dispersions were stirred at 60°C for 6 h and subsequently the solvent was replaced with toluene by distillation. Example E (Synthesis of ZrO2 dispersion by nonaqueous process) ZrO2 nanoparticles were synthesized according to the nonaqueous process described in "S. Zhou, G. Garnweitner, M. Niederberger and M. Antonietti, Langmuir, 2007, 23, pages 9178-9187" and "T.A. Cheema and G. Garnweitner published in Chemie-lngenieur-Technik, 2008, 84/3, pages 301 -308". 80ml zirconium(IV)-n-propoxide and 500ml benzyl alcohol were placed in an Teflon coated steel autoclave and heated to 220°C for 4 days. After cooling down to room temperature, the solid ZrO2 material was separated from the supernatant liquid by centrifugation. The isolated material was washed 3 times with 1 L of ethanol. 5g of the wet solid material was then suspended in 200ml of THF and 1 ,7g n-propyl(trimethoxy)silane were added. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred at room temperature for 3 days. The transparent dispersion was then concentrated by evaporation of a part of the THF to adjust a solid content of 20 weight%. The average particle size was characterized by light scattering and was found to be 7nm. Examples 1 -9 (Synthesis of Hybrid Material) All nanoparticle dispersions from Examples B-E were adjusted to a solids content of 20 weight percent. Example 1 In a 250 ml flask 50 g of polysilazane was dissolved in 50 g of THF in a nitrogen atmosphere and under careful exclusion of water. While stirring, 175 g of a zirconium dioxide dispersion in toluene with a mean particle size of approx. < 10 nm and a solids content of 20 weight percent were dropped in. The THF and the majority of the toluene were distilled off at the rotary evaporator at 50°C bath temperature and a reduced pressure of approx. 15 mbar. The last remaining toluene was removed from the residue in a high vacuum of < 0.1 mbar at 40°C for less than 24 h. 83 g of a colorless transparent oil remained. Example 2 Example 2 was carried out analogously to example 1 , the only difference being that the amount of zirconium oxide dispersion in toluene was increased to 250 g. The final product was 97 g of a colorless transparent oil. Example 3 Example 3 was carried out analogously to example 1 , the only difference being that the amount of zirconium oxide dispersion in toluene was increased to 750 g. 194 g of a colorless transparent oil remained as the final product. Example 4 Example 4 was carried out analogously to example 1 , the only difference being that the zirconium oxide dispersion was replaced by 250 g of a titanium dioxide dispersion in toluene with a mean particle size of approx. 10 nm and a solids content of 20 weight percent. 96 g of a colorless nearly transparent oil remained as the final product. Example 5 Example 5 was carried out analogously to example 4, the only difference being that the titanium dioxide dispersion in toluene was coated with Vinyl- trimethoxysilane instead of methyl-trimethoxysilane. 95 g of a colorless nearly transparent oil remained as the final product. Example 6 Example 6 was carried out analogously to example 1 , the only difference being that the zirconium dioxide dispersion was replaced by 250 g of a titanium dioxide dispersion in toluene with a mean particle size of approx. 25 nm and a solids content of 20 weight percent. 95 g of a colorless opalescent oil remained as the final product. Example 7 Example 7 was carried out analogously to example 1 , the only difference being that the zirconium dioxide dispersion was replaced by 250 g of a silicon dioxide dispersion in toluene with a mean particle size of approx. 15 nm and a solids content of 20 weight percent. 94 g of a colorless nearly transparent oil remained as the final product. Example 8 Example 8 was carried out analogously to example 1 , the only difference being that the zirconium dioxide dispersion was replaced by 250 g of a silicon dioxide dispersion in toluene with a mean particle size of approx. 85 nm and a solids content of 20 weight percent. 96 g of a colorless slightly cloudy oil remained as the final product. Example 9 Example 9 was carried out analogously to example 1 , the only difference being that 250g of the zirconium dioxide dispersion of Example E in THF with a mean particle size of approximately 7 nm and a solids content of 20 weight percent was used. 94 g of a colorless transparent oil remained as the final product. Reference Example 10 The polysilazane "as it is" was used as a reference example 9 for a polysilazane without addition of any nanoparticles. The examples are shown in comparison in Table 1 . The viscosity of the oil-like products is determined with a R/S Plus Rheometer by the company Brookfield. The transmission of the liquid samples was measured with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer Lambda 850 from Perkin Elmer before curing. The products were cured in order to determine the refractive index. For this aim, the oil-like products were each mixed with 0.5 wt.-% di-t. butyl-peroxide, poured into a 3 cm x 2 cm PTFE receptacle to a height of 3 mm and cured for 3 h at 180°C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Subsequently, the hardened molded piece was removed from the PTFE receptacle and the refractive index was measured with a Prism Coupler Model 2010/M by the company Metricon working at 594 nm. Table 1 Listing of the Examples *Refractive Index of the cured sample **Transmittance of the li quid sample at 450 nm and thickness of 3mm relative to example 9 Since the organopolysilazane and the nanoparticles do not absorb light of 450nm wavelength, the reduced transmittance is ascribed to scattering ***Transmittance of the Reference Example was normalized to be 100% at all wavelength **** HRI-Silicone and LRI-Silicone are available from Dow Corning The comparison of Reference Example 10 with Example 1 , Example 2 and Example 3 shows that increasing the proportion of highly refractive zirconium dioxide increases the refractive index. Due to the nanoparticles, a slight increase of viscosity can be observed. As the nanoparticles are smaller than 10 nm, no or a very small degree of scattering of light occurs and the optical transparency is just as high or only slightly lower than in Reference Example 10. Examples 4, 5 and 6 show that the refractive index can also be increased by admixing highly refractive titanium dioxide. With nanoparticles of small size, such as in Examples 4 and 5, the optical transparency is retained to > 90%, whereas use of larger nanoparticles, such as in example 6, can cause opalescence. Comparison of Example 4 and 5 proofs that the surface of the nanoparticles can be coated either with non-reactive alkyl groups or with vinyl groups which are able to participate in the crosslinking reaction of the organopolysilazane during the curing process. This will not change the transparency of the product. Examples 7 and 8 show that the refractive index of the mixture is slightly lowered by admixing a silicon dioxide with a refractive index smaller (n amorphous S1O2 = 1 .46) than that of the polysilazane. With nanoparticles of 15 nm size, such as in Example 7, the optical transparency is noticeable lowered, whereas use of larger nanoparticles with a radius of about 85 nm, such as in Example 8, causes a marked opalescence. Reference Examples 1 1 ) and 12) show commercially available silicone encapsulation materials. Standard methyl-silicones (Example 12) are known to have good thermal stability, however their big drawback is the low Rl of < 1 .45. Commercially available high Rl silicones (example 1 1 ) have Rl up to 1 .55, but can not reach Rl numbers beyond 1 .6. Thus, it can be shown that by mixing polysilazane with nanoparticles whose refractive index is higher or lower than that of pure polysilazane, the refractive index of the mixture can be increased or lowered. The refractive index can theoretically be adjusted between 1 .3 to 2.4. The mixtures containing nanoparticles can be cured in the same way as pure polysilzane. If the nanoparticles are sufficiently small, no light dispersion occurs and the optical transparency is maintained completely (see Fig. 1 ). Example for lower CTE sample Another advantage of the presence of nanopartides is the reduction in thermal expansion of the hybrid material compared to the pure polysilazane. The CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion, analyzed with a Mettler-Toledo TMA SDTA840 in a temperature range of 50-150°C) of cured polysilazane is in a range of 150-250 ppm/K. The CTE of cured polysilazane filled with 50% weight % of nanopartides is in a range of 125-200 ppm/K. The advantage of reduced CTE is less stress in the material by temperature change and therefore a lower tendency of crack formation. Example for hydrolysis stability An additional advantage of nanopartides filled organopolysilazane compared to the pure polysilazane is that the refractive index does not change if the cured material is exposed to higher temperature and humidity conditions. The cured materials of Example 3 and of Example 10 were stored in a climate chamber at 80°C and 85% relative humidity for 82h. The refractive index of reference material of Example 10 was reduced from 1 .50 to 1 .48 by partial hydrolysis of the silazane to siloxane. The refractive index of the material of Example 3 remains unchanged at 1 .74. The prescence of the nanoparticle prevents the change in refractive index under conditions which are able to at least partly hydrolyze the polysilazane. Fig.1 shows transmission curves of various examples: Transmittance of reference Example 10 was normalized to be 100% at all wavelength. Therefore the spectra shown in Figure 1 show reduction of transmittance caused by addition of Nanopartides A) transmittance of material of Example 1 B) transmittance of material of Example 3 C) transmittance of material of Example 4 D) transmittance of material of Example 7 Since the organopolysilazane and the nanoparticles do not absorb light of > 350nm wavelength, the reduced transmittance is ascribed to scattering phenomena. The transmittance of reference Example 10 was normalized to be 100% at all wavelength. Therefore the reduction in transmittance shown in Fig 1 is a result of light scattering caused by the presence of the nanoparticles. The scattering intensity depends of course not only on the particle size, but also on the difference in refractive index of the particles and the surrounding matrix, as can be calculated by the well known equation: I ~ M · (dn/dc)2 · λ4 I = Intensity of scattered light M = Molecular weight. For a homogeneous sphere M ~ radius3 dn/dc ~ difference in refractive index of the particles and the surrounding matrix If the refractive index of the particles and the surrounding matrix is the same, there will be no light scattering, regardless of the size of the particles. Avoiding scattering by this approach is not useful to make high Rl material, because in such a situation the refractive index of the hybrid material is not different from the refractive index of the pure matrix. Figure 2 shows the particle size distribution of various examples: A) particle size of Nanoparticles used in Example 1 , 2 and 3 B) particle size of Nanoparticles used in Example 7 C) particle size of Nanoparticles used in Example 8 Distribution A) is an example of a exceptionally preferred particle distribution used to make transparent hybride material, which in the definition used here has a transmission of > 80% at 450nm. Distribution B) is an example of acceptable particle distribution and distribution C is an exemple of non preferred particle distribution. B) and C) will form partly transparent and/ or opaque hybrid material, which in the definition used here has a transmission of < 80% at 450nm. Figure 3 shows further particle sizes and distributions: A) preferred particle size and distribution: small average < 10nm and narrow distribution B) Less preferred particle size and distribution: small average < 10nm but bimodal distribution containing a big amount of particles > 10nm C) Less preferred particle size and distribution: big average > 10nm and narrow distribution D) None preferred particle size and distribution: big average > 10nm and broad distribution containing particles up to 100nm size. Fig. 3 shows examples of small and narrow distributions (A), small but bimodal distributions (B) ), a medium size and narrow distribution (C) and a medium size but broad distributions (D). Only distributions obeying the two conditions of small average size of < 15nm and narrow distribution with small amount of average size particles and absence of big size particles as shown in distribution A) are useful to make fully transparent hybrid material. If - for any reason - a certain turbidity is irrelevant or is even intended, bigger particles with broader distribution can be used as well. In case the turbidity should be adjusted to a certain level at constant refractive index, this can be done by keeping the mixing ratio of nanoparticles and matrix constant (which defines the refractive index) and changing the size (average and distribution) of the nanoparticles. Figure 4 shows the comparison of the Rl numbers of the Examples 1 , 2 and 3 and a theoretical calculation of Rl of a mixture of polymer and ZrO2. A) Theoretical calculation # B) experimental numbers of Example 1 , 2 and 3 The calculation is based on the assumption that the polymer has a Rl of 1 .5 and a density of 1 .0 g/ml and the ZrO2 has a Rl of 2.2 and a density of 5.0 g/ml. It can be seen that the experimental results nicely follow the theoretical expectations. To test the thermal stability, some selected solid cured samples of 30x20x3 mm size were prepared and stored on an open hotplate (exposed to air atmosphere) at a temperature of 120°C, 180°C and 200°C for 24h. After the heat treatment the transmittance was measured using a Perkin Elmer UV-VIS Spectrophotometer Lambda 850 in combination with an integration sphere. Transmittance of solid sample at 450 nm and thickness of 3mm Fig.5 shows transmission curves after stability test at elevated temperatures: A) transmittance of cured material of Example 2 after 24h at 120 B) transmittance of cured material of Example 2 after 24h at 180°C C) transmittance of cured material of reference Example 9 after 24h at 200°C D) transmittance of cured material of Example 2 after 24h at 200°C There is a slight decrease in transmittance by heating up to 200°C, but only to a minor and tolerable extent. Comparison of Sample 2 and the Ref. Example 9 proves that there is virtually no deterioration of the transmittance by the presence of the nanoparticles up to 200°C. Fig.6: Transmission curves after stability test at elevated temperatures A) transmittance of cured material of Example 2 after 24h at 120 B) transmittance of cured material of Reference Example 10 (HRI Silicone) after 24h at 120°C Fig 6) shows the transmittance of Example 2 and Reference Example 10) after heating to 120°C for 24h. The commercially available HRI silicones are made of aryl-silicones, for example phenyl-silicones. The aromatic residue increases the Rl, however the thermal stability is dramatically reduced.
