BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to portable exercise and rehabilitation apparatus and more particularly to arrangements for conditioning, rehabilitating and healing body limbs such as arms, legs, ankles and feet. 2. Discussion of the Art Injuries to body limbs, such as for example, bone spurs, shin splints, bone breaks, joint damage, sprains, strains and tears of ligaments, tendons and muscles are common amongst both the young and the old. Strengthening for example, foot and lower leg muscles to help rehabilitate, improve blood circulation, reduce swelling and relieve pain associated with a wide range of physical issues often are helped by “pin point” directed exercise of that injured area. There is a need for exercise and rehabilitation devices which in injured individual may utilize on his or her own time and also use and improve under the direction and supervision of a medical professional. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a device for the exercise and rehabilitation of an injured patient, wherein that device may be utilized in a medical professional's office and or utilized by that injured patient and his or her own home. It is a further object of the present invention to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. It is a yet still further object of the present invention to provide an exercise and rehabilitation device which is portable, adjustable, and may be utilized with a gradually or stepwise changeable array of resistance capabilities associated therewith. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an exercise and rehabilitation device which may be utilized by a patient who is supine, seated, or standing. It is yet still another object of the present invention to provide an exercise and rehabilitation device which may be utilized to treat for example, a patient's ankle or foot, leg, arm, wrist, forearm, shoulder and neck. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises an elongated portable resistance exercise and rehabilitation device for treating an injured patient's limb and musculature. The resistance device in a first preferred embodiment is of a generally “banjo” configuration when viewed from above. The resistance device has a first end or first half of preferably circular configuration, herein called the “resistance portion” thereof, and is unitarily joined with or attached to a second end or second half of generally elongated rectilinear configuration, which second half comprises a handle therefore, herein called the “limb support portion”. The first end or first-half and the second end or second-half have a common longitudinal axis therealong. The first half or first end of circular configuration preferably has a generally planar base having at least an “attachment-permitting” periphery preferably comprising a partial peripheral lip extending upwardly therefrom for at least about 300° therearound. The “attachment-permitting” periphery or in one aspect of the present invention, has a partial peripheral lip on a first side of the longitudinal axis has a plurality of resistance-band attachment points, which are for example, spaced-apart slots disposed therearound. The partial peripheral lip has a second side on the longitudinal axis which also has a plurality of resistance-bands attachment points such as spaced apart slots disposed therearound in corresponding diametrical alignment with the spaced apart attachment point slots on the first side thereof. The attachment slots are preferably correspondingly numbered diametrically across from one another. Resistance bands (elasticized, somewhat stretchable members) may be placed across the first half of the resistance device, the resistance portion, preferably between corresponding attachment points, such as for example the slots, placed diametrically across or longitudinally transverse from one another. The successive resistance bands utilized with the resistance device of the present invention may be of differing tension to enable changes in the resistance and enable graduated strengthening of body parts utilized/exercised therewith. The resistance bands may have for example, a “J” shaped hook on each end thereof to enable their secure capture in the various attachment point slots at their respective sides of the peripheral lip upstanding from the planar base thereof. In the utilization of the present exercise and rehabilitation device, if a patient were treating for example his foot, his heel might likely be placed on the location thereon where the handle meets the juncture of the circumference of a resistance portion first half. A resistance band would be placed between appropriate attachment points or slots across the resistance portion based between the first side of the peripheral lip and the second side of the peripheral lip. Appropriate pivoting/turning or twisting of the foot about its heel, against a resistance band for example, may be one type of exercise as prescribed by an appropriate medical professional. A further aspect of the present invention may include a hinge point, where the juncture of the second half of the exercise and rehabilitation device (the handle) mates with the first half (the resistance portion) of the rehabilitation and exercise device. Such a hinge point would include a hinge which would preferably be lockable into one or more specific angular orientations from being planar with the first half of the rehabilitation and exercise device. Such a configuration would enable a patient to better utilize this device in a supine or sitting configuration. A yet further aspect of the present invention comprises a peripherally adjustable resistance-band-height-extending attachment on each longitudinal side of the peripheral lip, to enable one or more displaced resistance bands to be extended across the first half of the rehabilitation and exercise device, so as to permit that resistance band to be placed under that body portion being treated. This could be in conjunction with a second resistance band stretched across corresponding attachment points right on the peripheral lip itself as aforementioned in the initial embodiment, to enable resistance of a patient's body limb being resistively moved both towards the surface of the first half of the exercise and rehabilitation device as well as resistively moved away from the resistance portion surface of that exercise and rehabilitation device. Such a combination of at least two (an upper resistance band and a lower resistance band) would thus provide the patient with exacting exercise in multiple upwardly and downwardly directions to facilitate pinpoint treatment of that patient's injuries and concerns. A yet further aspect of the present invention may comprise the shape of the resistance portion, that is, the first half of the exercise and rehabilitation device. Such a changed shape may conform to a rectilinear configuration or to an oval configuration to enable certain limited types of body limb exercise treatments to take place as may be needed. A yet further embodiment of the exercise and rehabilitation device would comprise a curvilinear bottom of the resistance half, to enable a backward and forward rocking thereof or a side to side rocking/twisting or a combination of the two to enable a more precise muscular movement/improvement. The invention thus comprises an elongated exercise and rehabilitation device for exercising body limb members, the elongated device comprising: a first-half resistance portion connected to a second half body limb support portion, wherein the first-half resistance portion has a peripheral array of resistance band anchor points disposed therearound; a peripheral-location-adjustable resistance band securable across the first-half resistance portion to enable a body portion limb to be supported by the second half body limb support portion and to be controllably resisted against movement by a resistance band extending adjustably across the first-half portion thereof. The first-half resistance portion may have a peripheral lip extending at least partially peripherally therearound. The peripheral lip preferably has a plurality of anchor points arranged therearound. The peripheral lip on a first side of the first half resistance portion have a corresponding array of anchor points to an array of anchor points on a second side of the peripheral lip of the first half resistance portion. The anchor points may comprise slots extending across the peripheral lip. Each resistance band may have a “J” shaped hook on each end thereof. The “J” shaped hook on each end of a resistance band engages the anchor point in the peripheral lip. The first half and the second half may be connected to one another by a hinge. The hinge is preferably lockable to secure angularity between the first half and the second half of the elongated exercise and rehabilitation device. A peripherally adjustable resistance band elevating-member may be arrangeable on each lateral side of the first half, to enable a body portion to have a resistance band arranged against an upper side and a lower side of a body portion being exercised and rehabilitated. The elongated exercise and rehabilitation device for exercising body limb members may have a planar base. The resistance portion may in another embodiment, have a curvilinear base. The invention also comprises a process for the adjustable exercise and stepped rehabilitation of a body part comprising one or more of the following steps of: arranging a resistance portion and a limb support portion together to comprise a body part exercise and rehabilitate device, to enable a body part to be supported and movement-resisted thereon; attaching a resistance band transversely across a defined peripheral portion of the resistance portion of the device to enable a body part to be biased against and exercised thereby, when a body part is placed and moved thereagainst; articulating the resistance portion with respect to the limb support portion of the exercise and rehabilitation device to enable a user thereof to be positioned supinely; placing a second resistance band across the resistance portion of the device to enable a body part to be resisted against movement both towards and away from the resistance portion of the exercise and rehabilitation device; arranging a curvilinear base onto a bottom portion of the resistance portion of the exercise and rehabilitation device to enable a body part to be moved against transverse and/or longitudinal resistance. The invention may also comprise a method of enabling adjustable exercise and rehabilitation of musculature of a human body on an exercise and rehabilitation device, comprising one or more of the following steps of: arranging a resistance portion and a resting portion on the device, to enable the adjustable resistive exercise of human musculature; stretching at least one first resistance band across the resistance portion of the device between a set of spaced-apart access points on the resistance portion of the device to enable a body limb to be placed between the at least one first resistance band and a surface portion of the resistance portion of the device; stretching at least one second resistance band across the resistance portion of the device between a set of spaced-apart access points on the resistance portion of the device to enable a body limb to be placed between the at least one second resistance band and a surface portion of the resistance portion of the device, wherein the second at least one resistance band has a tension which may be different from the at least one first resistance band, and wherein the first and second resistance bands may be arranged to receive a body limb between one another.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to drawings in detail, and particularly to FIG. 1, the present invention is shown which comprises an elongated portable resistance exercise and rehabilitation device 10 for treating an injured patient's limb and musculature. The resistance device 10 in a first preferred embodiment is of a generally “banjo” configuration when viewed from above, as represented in FIG. 1. The resistance device 10 has a first end or first half 12 of preferably circular configuration, herein called the “resistance portion” thereof, and is unitarily joined with or attached to a second end or second half 14, of generally elongated rectilinear configuration, which second half comprises a handle therefore, herein called the “limb support portion”. The first end or first-half 12 and the second end or second half 14 have a common longitudinal axis “L” therealong. The first half or first end 12 of circular configuration has a generally planar base 16 having an engagement-permitting periphery, preferably in one preferred aspect thereof, comprising at least a partial peripheral lip 18 extending upwardly therefrom, for preferably at least about 300° therearound, as best represented in FIG. 1. The engagement-permitting periphery, in this aspect, the partial peripheral lip 18 on a first side 20 of the longitudinal axis has a plurality of resistance-band attachment points 22, which are for example, spaced-apart slots disposed therearound. The partial peripheral lip 18 has a second side 24 on the longitudinal axis “L” which also has a plurality of resistance-bands attachment points 26 such as spaced apart slots disposed therearound in corresponding diametrical alignment with the spaced apart attachment point slots 22 on the first side 20 thereof. The attachment slots 22 and 26 are preferably correspondingly numbered diametrically across from one another. A resistance band 30 may be placed across the first half 12 of the resistance device 10, the “resistance portion”, preferably between corresponding attachment points 22 and 26, such as the slots, placed diametrically across or longitudinally transverse from one another, as represented in FIGS. 4 and 5. Successive resistance bands 30 may be utilized with the resistance device 10 of the present invention may be of differing tension to enable changes in the resistance and enable graduated strengthening of body parts utilized therewith. The resistance bands 30, as shown in multiple peripheral anchor points 26, for example in FIG. 3, may have for example, a “J” shaped hook 32 on each end thereof to enable their secure capture in the various attachment point slots 22 and 26, at their respective sides 20 and 24 of the peripheral lip 18 upstanding from the planar base 16 thereof. It is to be noted that the peripheral lip 18 provides those attachment points 22 and 26 elevated from the planar base 16. A further aspect and embodiment of the present invention, not shown herein, may eliminate the raised peripheral lip 18 yet facilitate attachment points along the periphery of the planar base 16. The engagement periphery in a further embodiment may comprise eyehooks 27, or slots 29 peripherally disposed about the circumference of the resistance portion 12, as represented in FIGS. 1 and 2 respectively. The resistance portion 12 in yet a further aspect thereof, may have a curvilinear base 31, as represented by the dashed lines in FIG. 2. Such a curvilinear base 31 may be somewhat hemispherical or curved only transversely or longitudinally, to permit muscle manipulation in multiple quadrants singularly or simultaneously. In the utilization of the present exercise and rehabilitation device, if a patient were treating his foot “F”, his heel “H” might likely be placed on the location thereon where the handle 14 meets the juncture “J” of the circumference of a resistance portion first half 12, as represented in FIG. 4 and in FIG. 1. A resistance band 30 would be placed between appropriate attachment points or slots 22 and 26 across the resistance portion 12 based between the first side 20 of the peripheral lip 18 and the second side 24 of the peripheral lip 18, as represented in FIGS. 4 and 5. Appropriate pivoting/turning or twisting of the foot “F” about its heel “H” for example, may be one type of exercise as prescribed by an appropriate medical professional. A further aspect of the present invention may include a hinge point, where the juncture of the second half 14 of the exercise and rehabilitation device 10 (the handle) mates with the first half 12 (the resistance portion) of the rehabilitation and exercise device 10, as represented in a sectional view of FIG. 6. Such a hinge point would include a hinge 36 which would preferably be lockable into one or more specific angular orientations from being planar with the first half 12 of the rehabilitation and exercise device 10. Such a configuration would enable a patient to utilize this device in a supine or sitting configuration. A yet further aspect of the present invention as represented in FIG. 7, which comprises a peripherally adjustable resistance-band-extending attachment 40 on each longitudinal (lateral) side of the peripheral lip 18, to enable one or more resistance bands 42 to be displaceably extended across the first half of the rehabilitation and exercise device, so as to permit that resistance band to be placed under that body portion “F” being treated, as represented in FIG. 7. This could be in conjunction with a second resistance band stretched across corresponding attachment points right on the peripheral lip 18 itself, also represented in FIG. 7, and as represented aforementioned in the initial embodiment, shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, to enable resistance of a patient's body limb being resistively moved both towards the surface of the base 16 of the first half 12 of the exercise and rehabilitation device 10 as well as resistively moved away from the resistance portion surface of that exercise and rehabilitation device 10, as represented by arrow “A”, in FIG. 7. Such a combination of at least two (an upper resistance band and a lower resistance band) would thus provide the patient with exacting exercise in multiple upwardly and downwardly directions to facilitate pinpoint treatment of that patient's injuries and concerns. A yet further aspect of the present invention may comprise the shape of the resistance portion, that is, the first half 12 of the exercise and rehabilitation device 10.
