(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(2-meth yl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
The crude (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 51b (20 mg, 0.04 mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 mL of a mixture of methanol and tetrahydrofuran (V/V=2:1), then 0.2 mL of 1M lithium hydroxide solution was added. After stirring at room temperature for 12 hours, the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and 1 M HCl was added to the residue until pH was 4. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mLÃ—2). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by thin layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(2-methy 1-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid 51 (10 mg, yield 50%) as a white solid.
