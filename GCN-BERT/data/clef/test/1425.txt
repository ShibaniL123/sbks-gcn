Example 6 : Preparation of 3,5-bis(2-aminopyrimidin-4-yl)pyridin-2-ol (XXXXII)
Example 6-1 : Preparation of 1-(5-bromo-2-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-ethanone (XXXVI)
3,5-Bromo-2-methoxypyridine (XXXV) (100 mg, 1.13 mmol), palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) (5.03 mg, 25.04 µmole), and 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (DPPP) (14.4 mg, 45.3 µmole) were dissolved in 1.0 mL of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim] [BF4]), and butyl vinyl ether (345 µL, 2.56 mmole) and triethylamine (TEA) (125.03 µL, 0.192 mmole) were slowly added dropwise to the resulting solution. The resulting mixture was stirred at 130 °C for 24 hrs and cooled to room temperature. 2 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) was slowly added dropwise to the mixture to adjust pH to 1∼2 and the mixture was stirred for 30 min and neutralized. The resulting solution was diluted with dichloromethane, washed with water. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-Hex/EA = 3/1) to give the title compound (53 mg, 41 %).
