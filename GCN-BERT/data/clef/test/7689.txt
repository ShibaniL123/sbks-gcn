CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/550,827, filed Aug. 31, 2009, now copending, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND Ion exchange polymers are useful in many applications, for example, making ion exchange membranes or coatings for ion separation processes. Common technique for producing ion-exchange polymers involves polymerization of a non-ionic, non-water soluble, di-ethylenic cross-linking agent, for example, divinyl benzene with a monomer such as styrene in a non-aqueous solvent such as diethyl-benzene. The resulting solid polymer, for example, in sheet or membrane form is equilibrated or washed several times with a solvent such as ethylene dichloride to remove and replace the diethyl-benzene solvent. Where cation exchange membranes are desired, the membranes are then reacted with a solution of sulfur trioxide and ethylene dichloride to form sulfonate groups which upon washing with methanol and neutralization with sodium bicarbonate gives the polymer strongly basic ion-exchange properties. The water insoluble monomers and the polymerization reaction and subsequent reaction carried out in non-aqueous solvents necessitate chemical disposal problems with attendant loss of the organic solvents. Water-soluble cross-linking agents polymerizable in aqueous solvent systems have been developed to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Cross-linking of the polymer occurs by means of a condensation reaction between two monomers and takes place simultaneously with the polymerization, so no di-ethylenic monomers are required. At the same time, the expense of petroleum derived solvents and the problem of their disposal are eliminated. However, most currently available water-soluble cross-linking agents are expensive and not environment friendly. In the meantime, some applications, e.g., supercapacitor electrodes, prefer polymers that have low resistance, low swelling ratio and good coating morphology and that can be coated to decrease the energy consumption and increase current efficiency of the electrodes. Thus, it would be desirable to have a method for making a low swelling ratio polymer from water soluble, cheap and environment friendly materials and a method for coating an electrode with the polymer to reduce resistance and increase current efficiency of the electrode.

The preparation of the copolymers according to the invention is preferably carried out by free radical polymerization in aqueous solution at a reaction temperature of preferably 40° C. to 80° C. The polymerization can be carried out by initially introducing all or individual constituents of the reaction mixture into the reaction vessel, or by initially introducing portions of the components and topping up the constituents or individual constituents of the reaction mixture. The initiation is carried out by means of the customary water-soluble agents which form free radicals, which are preferably employed in amounts of 0.01 to 3.0% by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers.

The following examples are included to provide additional guidance to those of ordinary skill in the art in practicing the claimed invention. Accordingly, these examples do not limit the invention as defined in the appended claims. Monomer Solution Preparation: 2-Acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (20 g, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich®), 28 g N-(hydroxymethyl) acrylamide and 8.3 g urea (carbonyldiamine) were mixed together with 44 g deioned water under strong stirring. After the monomers were well dissolved, 1 g 2,2′-(azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrocloride was added into the solution and the solution was stirred until the 2,2′-(azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrocloride was dissolved. 2,2′-(Azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrocloride was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich®. N-(hydroxymethyl) acrylamide and urea were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd., Shanghai, China. Coating for Electrode: A carbon electrode (16 cm*32 cm*1.0 mm) prepared by pressing a calendered active carbon sheet onto a Ti mesh and sandwiched between two pieces of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films (16 cm*32 cm) was sealed into a thermoplastic bag while 3 small openings (10 mm in diameters) were left open on the thermoplastic bag. The prepared solution was added into the thermoplastic bag through the openings. The entire thermoplastic bag was then sandwiched between two pieces of glass plates (24 cm*40 cm) with a U type rubber gasket (17 cm*34 cm) located between the thermoplastic bag and the glass plates to make sure the whole electrode surface immerged in the solution. The assembly was put into a vacuum cabinet and degassed for 6 minutes to accelerate wetting of the solution to the electrode. After that, the assembly was taken out of the vacuum cabinet and the U type gasket was disassembled therefrom. Excessive solution was extruded from the thermoplastic bag and clamps were used to clamp the two glass plates toward each other. Put the new assembly into an oven at 80° C. for 2.5 hours. After the new assembly cooled down, the coated electrode was taken out and its thickness was measured out to be 1.1 mm compared with 10 mm of uncoated bare electrode. Some dry polymer scrap samples were taken from the thermoplastic bag to test swelling ratio and —SO3− density of the polymer. The resistance and current efficiency of the electrode were tested in an assembled cell. Swelling Ratio Dry polymer sample (0.327 g) was put into a small bottle and 1.129 g of distilled water was added into the bottle. After 24 hours, the swelled sample was tested with low field NMR. Two kinds of proton signals appeared in the low field NMR spectra. One is for adsorbed water (swelling water) and the other is for free water. The free water signal has a linear relation with free water proton intensity, i.e., by changing the total amount of water in the water-saturated polymer sample, corresponding variation of free water signal intensity were got. Thus, a regression function of free water amount with free water proton intensity was obtained. The free water amount was calculated from free water proton intensity through the regression function to be 0.669 g. The adsorbed water amount was calculated as follows: Adsorbed water=Total water−Free water=1.129 g−0.669 g=0.46 g. Swelling ratio (weight)=(adsorbed water/dry polymer)*100%=0.46/0.327*100%=140%. —SO3− Density Dry polymer (1.32 g) was soaked in HCl solution (200 ml, 1 N) for 24 hours. The soaked polymer was rinsed with deionized water until the filtrate became neutral. Then put the polymer into NaCl solution (100 ml, 1 N) to equilibrate it for 24 hours. Took out 10 ml of the equilibrated solution and titrated the 10 ml of the equilibrated solution with NaOH solution (0.01 N). —SO3− density=ΔVNaon*0.01 N*10/dry polymer=(23.5*0.01*10)/1.32=1.78 Millimole per gram dry polymer. Resistance The coated electrode was assembled with a counter bare carbon electrode while a polymer flow spacer (size: 16 cm*24 cm, thickness: 0.7 mm), which was prepared by heat pressing a polymer mesh into a ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) polymer film to form a flow channel, was sandwiched between the two electrodes to test the resistance thereof in 1600 ppm NaCl solution. Land battery tester CT2001B and CT2001D from Wuhan Jinnuo Electronics Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China was used for the testing and the charge current was 1250 mA. The coated electrode resistance was calculated as follow: Resistance=cell resistance−solution resistance−counter electrode resistance. Cell resistance was obtained through the Land battery tester CT2001B and CT2001D (Cell resistance=ΔVoltage/current=0.125/1.25=0.10 Ohm). The solution resistance was calculated through the solution conductivity (solution resistance=1/conductivity*thickness=1/3.2*0.07=0.02 Ohm). Counter electrode resistance was pre-tested in a two identical bare carbon electrodes cell using the same testing method as with the coated electrode in which cell resistance=0.12 Ohm and solution resistance was 0.02 Ohm. The counter electrode resistance=(0.12−0.02)/2=0.05 Ohm. Thus, coated electrode resistance=0.10−0.02−0.05=0.03 Ohm. For a comparative study, a traditional IX membrane modified carbon electrode in which a piece of IX membrane (CR-67, GE Water & Process Technologies, Watertown, Mass., US) was attached onto a bare carbon electrode, was assembled with a bare carbon electrode while a polymer flow spacer (size: 16 cm*24 cm, thickness: 0.7 mm) was sandwiched between the two electrodes to test the resistance thereof in 1600 ppm NaCl solution. Land battery tester CT2001B and CT2001D was used and the charge current was 1250 mA. IX membrane modified carbon electrode resistance=Cell resistance−solution resistance−counter electrode resistance. The Cell resistance=ΔVoltage/current=0.24/1.25=0.19 Ohm. Solution resistance=1/conductivity*thickness=1/3.2*0.07=0.02 Ohm. Counter electrode resistance=(0.12−0.02)/2=0.05 Ohm. Thus, the IX membrane modified carbon electrode resistance=0.19−0.02−0.05=0.12 Ohm. The coated electrode resistance was 15.36 Ohm*cm2 (0.03 Ohm*512 cm2) compared with 61.44 ohm*cm2 (0.12*500 cm2) of the IX membrane modified carbon electrode. Current Efficiency Current efficiency was also tested in a two electrodes cell in 1600 ppm NaCl. Current efficiency=(Mole of removed salt*96500 coulombs/mole)/(coulombs of total used charges). The mole of removed salt was obtained through calculation of the solution conductivity change from feed solution to dilute solution to be 4.4 mmol. The total used charges were read through the Land battery tester CT2001B and CT2001D to be 450 coulombs. Therefore, Current efficiency=(Mole of removed salt*96500 coulombs/mole)/(coulombs of total used charges)=(4.4*96500*0.001/450)*100%=94.4%.
