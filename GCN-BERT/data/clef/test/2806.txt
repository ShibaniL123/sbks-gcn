FIELD OF INVENTION The presently described invention relates generally to dice games as used in casinos and other gambling establishments. More specifically it relates to a new game using rainbow colored dice for gambling. In particular, the invention resides in a game that involves wagering on the outcome of a first, a second, third or more roll of a pair of dice. BACKGROUND Dice games have been popular in many cultures since antiquity, both as gambling games and as games played purely for fun. The reason is the use of die introduces uncertainty into the game, which is the basis of die-based gambling games. When the die or dice are rolled, it is impossible to predict which sides of the dice will appear face up, and thus the underlying concept of all dice games is wagering on the outcome of a roll or multiple roles of the die or dice. The two most popular dice games in the world are craps and sic bo. Craps has originated and evolved in the Western world and is played with two dice, with players predicting the total of the two numbers appearing face up on the dice after they have been rolled, with some restrictions which can end the game on the first roll. Different bets are available and they are displayed and wagers can be placed by transferring betting chips to the betting area which allows the players to bet for or against the roller to various degrees. Sic bo is an ancient Chinese game that offers certain advantages for new players compared to craps. It is played with three dice which offers a greater number of outcomes. A more important factor is that all the bets are decided in one roll only and this eliminates the complexities that are found in craps. Players can bet on either the total of the three dice or on the dice combination of either any two dice or of all three dice. However, there is always a need for new games, particularly in casinos, to encourage and maintain interest in dice games. Ideally, new games are easy to learn, fast to play and have sufficient returns for the players, while retaining a suitable house advantage. A game that has a short cycle is preferred so that more rounds of the game can be played in any given period. In addition, a player should not be required to make too many decisions and the game should be easy to administer. The present invention provides a new game, preferably played with a pair of dice, that provides all of the advantages and meets all of the requirements set out above. SUMMARY The presently described dice game relates generally to a game using regular, even number sided polyhedrons as dice, such as two-, four to twenty sided die and placing bets on the outcome of either single rolls or multiple rolls as detailed herein. For convenience the game is referred to as Rainbow Dice (“Rainbow Dice”). Rainbow Dice is novel from any other table game or game of chance in that it is played with two, cubic four-sided to dodecahedral twenty-sided dice, wherein the bets are placed on the various color-combinations possible from the roll of the dice. Rainbow Dice is played on a game table similar to, but distinct from, a Craps table. In a preferred embodiment, the Rainbow Dice game table has bets split into two categories, preferably called “Single Rolls” and “Multiple Rolls”. The Single Roll side of the game table is divided into bets on the outcome of any roll of the dice at any point in the game. Players placing bets on the Single Roll side of the table can place a bet: (1) that the next roll of the dice results in one of three color combinations designated “Any Craps”; (2) that the next roll of the dice results in the same color on both dice, or an “Any Doubles”; (3) that the next roll of the dice results in at least one of the dice having a designated color, or “One Of A Color”; (4) that the next roll of the dice results in an exact double, or “Doubles”; or (5) that the next roll of the dice is the exact color combination the player pre-designates as their prediction of the color outcome by placing his or her bet on that color combination, also preferably referred to as a “Combo”. The Multiple Roll side of the game table is divided into several sections on which bets may be placed, such as a “Pass” line, a “Don't Pass” line, a section for “Exact Doubles” combinations, a section for “Exact Craps” combinations, and a section for “Exact Point” combinations. The “Exact Doubles”, “Exact Craps” and “Exact Point” combinations are designated as “Odds Bets” and may be placed at any time during a “Point Throw Phase” of the game, until the Pass line bets are either won or lost, as detailed below. A table showing the Multiple Roll side and Single Roll side game boards is called the Rainbow Dice Game Table (“RDGT”). The Rainbow Dice dice are regular, even number sided polyhedrons, with a different colored symbol, geometric form or designation, such as, for example, a circle on each of the sides, wherein each of the dice have the same combinations of colors. An example of the form of dice that may be used in the present games are shown in U.S. Design Pat. D692959. A preferred embodiment of a game of Rainbow Dice has two phases: the Come Out Throw Phase and the Point Throw Phase. Both phases are detailed below. Generally, a round of Rainbow Dice begins when the dice are assigned to a player, designated the “shooter.” The shooter is selected from the set of players who have bet at least the table minimum on either the “Pass” line or the “Don't Pass” line of the Multiple Roll side of the RDGT, or on any table minimum bet on the Single Roll side of the RDGT. In other embodiments, the “shooter” can be a mechanical or automated device, such as a machine that shoots dice on the gaming table. Once a shooter is selected, the round begins and progresses with a series of rolls of the dice or “throws.” On each throw, the shooter rolls a pair of dice, allowing the dice to come to rest on the playing surface. In some instances, based on a predetermined set of house rules, the dealer may determine that the dice have not landed properly and/or been thrown properly, and deems the throw a “no throw.” Such no-throws are usually not used to determine the outcome of bets, and the shooter is normally permitted to rethrow the dice, with only the subsequent valid throw being counted. The shooter's first throw is called the “Come Out” throw. This phase is designated the “Come Out Throw Phase.” During the Come Out Throw Phase, the shooter and players wishing to make bets involving multiple throws must place bets on either the Pass or Don't Pass lines of the Multiple Roll side of the RDGT and may place bets on any section of the Single Roll side of the RDGT. The placement of a bet on either the Pass or Don't Pass line of the Multiple Roll side of the RDGT is the qualifying bet for further play during the designated shooter's turn at throwing the dice during the Point Throw Phase of the game, as detailed below. This bet is called the “Come Out Bet.” The Come Out Bet is available each time a bet on the Pass or Don't Pass line is won or lost, as detailed below. Players betting on the Pass line win if any Doubles are thrown during the Come Out throw. “Doubles” is when both dice are showing the same colors face-up (for example, red/red or blue/blue). Players betting on the Pass line lose if any Craps are thrown during the Come Out throw. “Craps” is when both dice are showing a designated combination of colors face-up (for example, red/green, blue/orange, yellow/purple) that are not a designated “Double” and not a designated “Point” color combination on the RDGT. Players betting on the Don't Pass line win if any Craps are thrown during the Come Out throw. Players betting on the Don't Pass line lose if any Doubles are thrown during the Come Out throw. If neither Doubles nor Craps are thrown during the Come Out throw, then the color combination thrown becomes the designated “Point” color for that round. A valid Point color is any color combination other than Doubles or those designated Craps. The dealer then marks the valid Point on the Multiple Roll side of the RDGT and the “Point Throw Phase” of the game begins. During the Point Throw Phase of Rainbow Dice, players can make bets on any section of either the Multiple Roll side or the Single Roll side of the RDGT. This includes Odds Bets, detailed above, on the Multiple Roll side of the RDGT. The shooter continues to roll during the Point Throw Phase of the Rainbow Dice game and the shooter's throw may result in: (1) the Point designated from that same shooter's Come Out throw; or (2) a Doubles. When the shooter's throw during the Point Throw Phase results in a Doubles, that round of the Multiple Roll game ends and the play begins anew with a different/new shooter as the dice are passed clockwise or counterclockwise to the next qualifying player. If the shooter's throw during the Point Throw Phase results in a designated Point, the same shooter continues. During the Point Throw Phase of the game, players placing bets on the Pass line win if the shooter throws the designated Point and lose if the shooter throws a Doubles. Players betting on the Pass line neither win nor lose if Craps is thrown during the Point Throw Phase. During the Point Throw Phase of the game, players placing bets on the Don't Pass line win if the shooter throws the Doubles and lose if the shooter throws either the designated Point or Craps. During the Point Throw Phase of the game, players placing Odds Bets win if the throw results in the exact combination they bet. During either the Come Out Throw Phase or Point Throw Phase of the game, a player may place bets on the Single Roll side of the table, as detailed above. These bets are specifically for the next throw. Once the shooter makes a valid throw, a dealer reads the color combination indicated by the pair of dice, and announces the result. Dealers evaluate the bets on both side of the RDGT and pay, collect, leave in play, or otherwise act on each bet based on the outcome of the throw and the rules of the table dictate. Players are then allowed to modify their bets before the next throw. Once the Point Throw Phase is over, all Odds Bets are removed. An alternative embodiment of the Rainbow Dice game involves the use of non-cubic dice which includes the use of dodecahedral dice. The use of dice with more than six sides allows for more combinations, larger odds and greater payouts for a win. The above summarized features of the Rainbow Dice game, Rainbow Dice dice and RDGT are provided in order that the detailed description thereof may be better understood, and in order that the advantages of the present systems may be better appreciated. Additional features and embodiments of the systems will be described hereinafter and will form the inventive subject matter supporting the claims appended hereto.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The presently described invention relates generally to dice games as used in casinos and other gambling establishments. More specifically it relates to a new game using colored dice, preferably rainbow colored dice, in lieu of numbered dice, for gambling. In particular, the invention resides in a game that involves wagering on the outcome of a second, third or more roll of a pair of dice. Various aspects of specific embodiments are disclosed in the following description, related drawings and table. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the sprit or the scope of the present disclosure. Additionally, well-known elements of exemplary embodiments will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure relevant details. Further, to facilitate an understanding of the description, a discussion of several terms used herein follows. The word “exemplary” is used herein to mean “serving as an example, instance or illustration.” Any embodiment described herein as “exemplary” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term “embodiments” is not exhaustive and does not require that all embodiments include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation. The presently described invention relates generally to a game using dice that are regular, even sided polyhedrons, such as two, four to twenty sided die and placing bets on the outcome of either single rolls or multiple rolls as detailed herein. The game is referred to herein as Rainbow Dice (“Rainbow Dice”). Rainbow Dice is novel in that it is played with two, identical, multi-colored die wherein each die has six different colors, and wherein the bets are placed on the various color-combinations possible from the roll of the dice, with corresponding designations on a gaming table preferably as described herein. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a pair or set of the cubic Rainbow Dice dice (100), each of which has a different color on each of the six sides (e.g. red (101), orange (102), yellow (103), green (104), blue (105) and purple (106)). These colors are exemplary and can be modified to different colors. The colors on each of the six sides correspond to the colors that are on the Rainbow Dice game table. In a preferred embodiment the die is cube-shaped and is identical to the other die in the set of cubic dice. In other embodiments, however, each side of the die can contain more than one color, and the die can be of other polyhedral configurations that have an even number of sides and in which all of the edges of the sides are of equal length, such as a tetrahedron, octahedron, or icosahedron. In one preferred embodiment, the Rainbow Dice game table has bets split into two categories: “Single Rolls” and “Multiple Rolls”. FIG. 2 is a plan view of the Single Roll side of the game table (200) is divided into bets on the outcome of any roll of the dice at any point in the game. The players placing bets on the Single Roll side of the table can place a bet: (1) that the next roll of the dice results in one of the three color combinations designated “Any Craps” (201), (2) that the next roll of the dice results in the same color on both dice, or an “Any Doubles” (202), (3) that the next roll of the dice results in at least one of the die having the designated color or “One Of A Color” (203), (4) that the next roll of the dice results in the exact double, or “Doubles” (204), or (5) that the next roll of the dice is the exact color combination the player designates as their prediction of the color outcome by placing their bet upon that color combination, or “Combos” (205). FIG. 3 is a view of the Multiple Roll side of the game table (300) is divided into the “Pass” line (301), the “Don't Pass” line (302), a section to bet on “Exact Doubles” combinations (303), a section to bet on “Exact Craps” combinations (304), and a section to bet on the “Exact Point” combinations (305). The “Exact Doubles”, “Exact Craps” and “Exact Point” are designated as “Odds Bets” and may be placed at any time during Point Throw Phase of the game, until the Pass line bets are either won or lost, as detailed below. Any of the combinations that are not either Doubles (303) or the designed Craps colors (304) are valid Points colors (305). FIG. 4 is the Rainbow Dice Game Table (“RDGT”) (400) with the combination of the Multiple Roll side and Single Roll side for betting. A game of Rainbow Dice has two phases: the “Come Out Throw Phase” and the “Point Throw Phase”. Both phases are detailed below. Generally, a round of Rainbow Dice begins when the Rainbow Dice dice (100) are assigned to a player, designated the “shooter.” The shooter is selected from the set of players who have bet at least the table minimum on either the “Pass” line (301) or the “Don't Pass” line (302) of the Multiple Roll side (300) of the RDGT, or on any table minimum bet on the Single Roll side (200) of the RDGT. Once a shooter is selected, the round begins and progresses with a series of rolls of the dice or “throws.” On each throw, the shooter rolls a pair of dice (100), allowing the dice (100) to come to rest on the RDGT (400). In some instances, based on a set of house rules, the dealer may determine that the dice have not landed properly and/or been thrown properly, and deems the throw a “no throw.” Such no-throws are usually not used to determine the outcome of bets, and the shooter is normally permitted to rethrow the dice (100), with only the subsequent valid throw being counted. The shooter's first throw is called the “Come Out” throw. This phase is designated the “Come Out Throw Phase.” During the Come Out Throw Phase, the shooter and players wishing to make bets on multiple throws must place bets on either the Pass (301) or Don't Pass (302) lines of the Multiple Roll side (300) of the RDGT (400) and may place bets on any section of the Single Roll side (200) of the RDGT (400). The placement of a bet on either the Pass (301) or Don't Pass (302) line of the Multiple Roll side (300) of the RDGT (400) is the qualifying bet for further play during the designated shooter's turn at throwing the dice (100) during the Point Throw Phase of the game, detailed below. This bet is called the “Come Out Bet.” The Come Out Bet is available each time a bet on the Pass (301) or Don't Pass (302) line is won or lost, as detailed below. Players betting on the Pass line (301) win if any Doubles (202) are thrown during the Come Out throw. Players betting on the Pass line (301) lose if any Craps (201) are thrown during the Come Out throw. Players betting on the Don't Pass line (302) win if any Craps (201) are thrown during the Come Out throw. Players betting on the Don't Pass line (302) lose if any Doubles (202) are thrown during the Come Out throw. If neither Doubles (202) nor Craps (201) are thrown during the Come Out throw, then the color combination thrown becomes the designated “Point” color (305) for that round. A valid Point color (305) is any color combination other than Doubles (202) or those designated Craps (201). The dealer then marks the valid Point color (305) on the Multiple Roll side (300) of the RDGT (400) and the “Point Throw Phase” of the game begins. During the Point Throw Phase of Rainbow Dice, players can make bets on any section of either the Multiple Roll side (300) or the Single Roll side (200) of the RDGT (400). This includes Odds Bets (303-305), detailed above, on the Multiple Roll side (300) of the RDGT (400). During the Point Throw Phase of the game, players placing bets on the Pass line (301) win if the shooter throws the designated Point (305) and lose if the shooter throws any Doubles (202). Players betting on the Pass line (301) neither win nor lose if any Craps (201) is thrown during the Point Throw Phase. During the Point Throw Phase of the game, players placing bets on the Don't Pass line (302) win if the shooter throws any Doubles (202) and lose if the shooter throws either the designated Point (305) or any Craps (201). During the Point Throw Phase of the game, players placing Odds Bets (303-305) win if their throw results in the exact combination they bet. During either the Come Out Throw Phase or Point Throw Phase of the game, player may place bets on the Single Roll side (200) of the RDGT (400), as detailed above. These bets are specifically for the next throw of the dice (100). Once the shooter makes a valid throw, a dealer reads the color combination indicated by the pair of dice (100), and announces the result. The dealer evaluates the bets on both sides of the RDGT (400) and pays, collects, leaves in play, or otherwise acts on each bet based on the outcome of the throw and the table rules. Players are then allowed to modify their bets before the next throw. The shooter continues to throw during the Point Throw Phase of Rainbow Dice game until the shooter makes a throw that results in a Doubles (202). When the shooter's throw during the Point Throw Phase results in a Doubles (202), that round of the Point Throw Phase of the game ends, the play begins anew with a different shooter and the dice are passed clockwise or counterclockwise to the next qualifying player. When the shooter's throw during the Point Throw Phase results in the Point (305) designated from that same shooter's Come Out throw, that same shooter can continue. Once the Point Throw Phase is over, all Odds Bets (303-305) are removed. Although specific embodiments of the Rainbow Dice dice, Rainbow Dice Game and Rainbow Dice Gaming Table have been described, various modifications, alterations, alternative constructions, and equivalents are also encompassed within the scope of these inventions. The specification and figures are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. It will, however, be evident that additions, subtractions, deletions, and other modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the inventions as set forth in the claims. 1.
