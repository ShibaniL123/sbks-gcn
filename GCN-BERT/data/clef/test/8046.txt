Example 3Preparation of 2-((5-chloro-2-((7-methyl-8-(piperidin-4-yl)-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]1,41di oxin-5-yl)amino)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-N,N-dimethylbenzenesulfonam ide (Compound 3)
(1) Preparation of N,N-dimethyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonamide
2-Nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (4.43 g, 20 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), and triethylamine (8.08 g, 80mmol)and dimethylamine hydrochloride (1.63 g, 20 mmol) were added. The resultant mixture was reactedat room temperature for 12 h. Water (100 mL) was added. After extraction withethyl acetate (150 mLÃ—2), the organic phases were combined, washed with saturated NaCl aqueous solution, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, and concentrated in vacuum. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate=3:1)to obtain the product (2.53 g, yield: 55%).
