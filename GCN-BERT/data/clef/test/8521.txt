FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to Grant No. R01 AI069146 awarded by the National Institute of Health. TECHNICAL FIELD This disclosure generally relates to soybean plants that have been genetically-engineered to improve their innate immunity. BACKGROUND The phytopathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae, can suppress both pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) by the injection of type III effector (T3E) proteins into host cells. T3Es achieve immune suppression using a variety of strategies including interference with immune receptor signaling, blocking RNA pathways and vesicle trafficking, and altering organelle function. Based, at least in part on the experimental results described herein, this disclosure provides compositions and methods that can be used to genetically engineer plants (e.g., soybean plants) that are able to exploit this interaction, thereby increasing the innate immunity of the plants.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION HopU1, a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADP-RT) from the pathogen, P. syringae, modifies GRP7, an RNA-binding protein in the plant. Native GRP7 binds to FLS2 and EFR RNA, but this binding is reduced when GRP7 is ribosylated at Arg 49 (R49). In addition, plants lacking GRP7 indicate that GRP7 plays a role in innate immunity. See, for example, Fu et al., 2007, Nature, 447:284-8; and Jeong et al., 2011, J. Biol. Chem., 286:43272-81. In order to increase the innate immunity of an agricultural crop, soybean sequences were identified that have a significant amount of homology to GRP7. These sequences were cloned and introduced into soybean plants, and their effect on innate immunity was evaluated. Innate immunity also is known as non-specific immunity and recognize and respond to pathogens immediately but does not confer long-lasting immunity to the host. Representative examples of biotic stresses include, without limitation, pathogens (e.g., bacteria, fungi, protozoa viruses, insects) or a physical lesion or wound. Nucleic Acids and Polypeptides The sequences identified in soybean have the nucleic acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33 and 35. The term “nucleic acid” refers to a deoxyribonucleic acid or a ribonucleic acid in single- or double-stranded form, sense or anti-sense, and, unless otherwise indicated, encompasses known analogues of natural nucleotides that hybridize to nucleic acids in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence includes the complementary sequence thereof. The term “operably linked” refers to functional linkage between a nucleic acid expression control sequence (such as a promoter, signal sequence, or transcription factor binding sites) and a coding nucleic acid sequence, wherein the expression control sequence affects transcription and/or translation of the coding nucleic acid sequence. Alignment of two or more sequences may be conducted, for example, using any number of methods (e.g., the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482), the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443), the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988, PNAS USA, 85:2444), computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA, as provided by, for example, the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.) or inspection). The preferred method of alignment uses the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol., 215:403-10) available from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov on the World Wide Web. The term “percent sequence identity” as applied to an amino acid sequence refers to a polypeptide that has at least 70% sequence identity (e.g., at least 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or 100% sequence identity) compared to another amino acid sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34 or 36). The term “percent sequence identity” as applied to nucleic acid sequences refers to a nucleic acid sequence that has at least 50% sequence identity (e.g., at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity) relative to another nucleic acid sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33 or 35). Another indication that nucleic acids possess sequence identity is if the two nucleic acid molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5° C. to about 20° C. (e.g., about 10° C. to about 15° C.) lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence (i.e., at a defined ionic strength and pH). The Tm is the temperature (i.e., under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of a first nucleic acid sequence hybridizes to a second nucleic acid sequence. Typically, stringent conditions are those in which the salt concentration is about 0.02 M at pH 7 and the temperature is at least about 60° C. For example, stringent hybridization conditions can include an initial wash in 6×SSC at 42° C. followed by one or more additional washes in 0.2×SSC at a temperature of at least about 55° C. (e.g., about 60° C. or 65° C.). A “purified polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide that has been separated from most components which naturally accompany it. Typically, a polypeptide is purified when it is at least 60%, by weight, free from the proteins and naturally-occurring organic molecules with which it is naturally associated (e.g., at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99%, by weight). Polypeptides may be obtained and purified using, for example, extraction from a natural source (for example, a plant cell); expression of a recombinant nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide; or chemically synthesizing the protein. Purity can be measured by any appropriate method, for example, column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or by HPLC analysis. Similarly, an “isolated nucleic acid” refers to a nucleic acid sequence free from the nucleic acid sequences that naturally flank it. Nucleic acids can be isolated using, for example, conventional molecular biology techniques including recombinant technologies. Transgenic Soybean Plants and Methods of Making Plant expression vectors typically include at least a cloned gene operably linked to regulatory sequences and a selectable marker. Regulatory sequences can include, without limitation, a promoter (for example, one conferring inducible or constitutive, pathogen- or wound-induced, environmentally- or developmentally-regulated, or cell- or tissue-specific expression), a transcription initiation start site, a ribosome binding site, an RNA processing signal, a transcription termination site, and/or a polyadenylation signal. Representative promoters include a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter and a cassava vein mosaic virus (CsVMV) promoter. These promoters confer high levels of expression in most plant tissues, and the activity of these promoters is not dependent on virally encoded proteins. CaMV is a source for both the 35S and 19S promoters. In most tissues of transgenic plants, the CaMV 35S promoter is a strong promoter. Other useful plant promoters include, without limitation, the nopaline synthase (NOS) promoter, the octopine synthase promoter, figwort mosaic virus (FMV) promoter, the rice actin promoter, and the ubiquitin promoter system. A selectable marker is used to identify those cells or plants that contain and express the plant transformation vector. Selectable markers suitable for transgenic plants include the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene of transposon Tn5 (Aph II) and genes imparting antibiotic resistance (e.g., those encoding resistance to hygromycin, kanamycin, bleomycin, neomycin, G418, streptomycin, or spectinomycin). Selectable markers also include genes encoding herbicide resistance (e.g., the bar gene encoding phosphinothricin acetyltransferase, which confers resistance to the broad-spectrum herbicide, Basta) and other genes that impart herbicide resistance such as glyphosate. Upon construction of the plant expression vector, several standard methods are available for introduction of the vector into a plant host, thereby generating a transgenic plant. These methods include Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (A. tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes) (see, for example, Lichtenstein and Fuller, In: Genetic Engineering, Vol 6, Rigby, ed., Academic Press, London, 1987; and Lichtenstein and Draper, In: DNA Cloning, Vol II, Glover, ed., IRI Press, Oxford, 1985; U.S. Pat.

Nos. 4,945,050 and 5,141,131);microinjection protocols;polyethylene glycol (PEG) procedures;liposome-mediated DNA uptake;electroporation protocols (see, for example, WO 87/06614 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,384,253, 5,472,869, 5,641,664, 5,679,558, 5,712,135, 6,002,070, and 6,074,877);the vortexing method; orthe “whiskers” methodology (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,302,523 and 5,464,765). Plant cells (e.g., protoplasts), plant tissue (e.g., embryonic tissue, callus tissue type I and II, hypocotyls, meristem, and the like) or seeds can be transformed with a plant expression vector as described herein. Once introduced into the plant cells, expression (e.g., of the selectable marker or of the gene to be expressed) may be assayed by any means known to the art, and expression may be measured as mRNA transcribed or protein synthesized. For example, expression of a nucleic acid sequence can be evaluated using Northern blot analysis (Ausubel et al., 2001, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, and Sambrook et al., 1998, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY), reverse transcription PCR (rtPCR) including quantitative rtPCR (see, e.g., Kawasaki et al., in PCR Technology: Principles and Applications of DNA Amplification, Erlich, Ed., Stockton Press, 1989; Wang et al., in PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications, Innis et al., Eds., Academic Press, 1990; and Freeman et al., 1999, Biotechniques 26:112-122 and 124-125). Additional well-known techniques for determining expression of a gene include in situ hybridization, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, 2001). Similarly, expression of a nucleic acid sequence can be measured at the level of protein production using standard protein analysis techniques including Bradford assays, spectrophotometric assays, and immunological detection techniques, such as Western blotting or immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific for the desirable polypeptide (Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, 2001, and Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY, 1989). Once plant cells expressing the desired level of a desirable gene product are obtained, plant tissues and whole plants can be regenerated therefrom using methods and techniques well-known in the art. The regenerated plants are then reproduced by conventional means and the introduced genes can be transferred to other strains and cultivars by conventional plant breeding techniques. For example, a transgenic soybean plant as described herein (i.e., expressing or over-expressing one or more of the soybean sequences described herein) can be crossed with a second soybean plant and progeny of the cross can be selected that express or over-express one or more of the soybean sequences described herein. In some embodiments, the progeny (i.e., the F1 population) can be crossed and an F2 population produced, or the F1 progeny can be backcrossed with one of the parent lines to produce a BC1 population. It would be understood that any number of plant crosses can be performed to produce populations including, without limitation, F3, BC1F2, and BC1F3 populations. In accordance with the present invention, there may be employed conventional molecular biology, microbiology, biochemical, and recombinant DNA techniques within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the methods and compositions of matter described in the claims. EXAMPLES Part A Overexpression in Arabidopsis Example 1 Plant Material Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana and Nicotiana tabacum were grown at 20-21° C. with a 10 h-photoperiod in environmentally controlled chambers. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Duchefa) and 1% sucrose at 22° C. with a 16 h-photoperiod. All experiments were performed in Col-0 background, except if indicated otherwise. The fls2 mutant used in this study is SALK—093905. The GRP7ox (Col-2/35S::GRP7), HopU1 (Col-0135S::HopU1-HA), GRP7-GFP (Col-0/355::GRP7-GFP), GRP7-HA (grp7-1/GRP7p::GRP7-HA), GRP7(R49K)-HA [grp7-1/GRP7p::GRP7(R49K)-HA] were previously published (see, for example, Fu et al., 2007, Nature, 447:284-288; Jeong et al., 2011, J Biol Chem, 286:43272-43281; Streitner et al., 2008, Plant J., 56:239-50; and Kim et al., 2008, Plant J., 55:455-466). The GRP7-GFP/HopU1 line was obtained by crossing the GRP7-GFP and HopU1 lines. The estradiol-inducible HopU1 line (ind_HopU1) was obtained by transforming Col-0 with the vector pLN604 (derived from pER8; see, for example Zuo et al., 2000, Plant J., 24:265-273) carrying HopU1-HA. The expression of HopU1 was induced by spraying 15 μM β-estradiol for 16-20 hours. The GRP8-HA (Col-0/35S::GRP8-HA) line was obtained by transforming Col-0 with the binary vector pPZP212 carrying GRP8-HA. Homozygous lines with a single transgene insertion were used for the experiments. Example 2 PTI Assays PAMP treatments (flg22 and elf18 peptides synthetized by Peptron, South Korea; shrimp chitin from SIGMA) were performed by syringe infiltration of plant leaves or by addition of the elicitor into the liquid media. Oxidative burst assays were performed on leaf disks incubated in a solution containing luminol and peroxidase as previously described (see, for example, Zipfel et al., 2004, Nature, 428:764-767). Callose deposition was observed after infiltration with a solution of 1 μM PAMP for 16 hours as previously described (see, for example, Hann et al., 2007, Plant J., 49:607-618). Callose deposits were quantified using PDQuest™ software (Bio-Rad). Example 3 Pseudomonas Infection Bacterial strains used in this study were Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000 wild-type (WT), Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 and Pto DC3000 hrcC+. For bacterial enumeration assays, plants were sprayed with the strains WT (inoculum: 106 cfu/mL), ΔhopU1 (inoculum: 108 cfu/mL) and hrcC+ (inoculum: 108 cfu/mL), in presence of 0.001% (v/v) Silwet L-77. Sprayed plants were then covered with a transparent plastic lid for the remaining of the experiment. For the other assays, bacteria were infiltrated into Arabidopsis leaves with the strains WT (inoculum: 5×107 cfu/mL), ΔhopU1 (inoculum: 108 cfu/mL) and hrcC+ (inoculum: 108 cfu/mL). Example 4 Yeast Two-Hybrid The coding region corresponding to the cytoplasmic part of EFR (EFRcyt) was cloned in the pLexA vector (Clontech). The recombinant pLexA-EFRcyt was used to screen a cDNA library prepared from infected Arabidopsis plants (van der Biezen et al., 2000, PNAS USA, 97:3747-52) according to the indications of the manufacturer. The coding region of GRP7 from nucleotide 67 to 528 (corresponding to the region of the GRP7 clone identified during the initial screen) was re-cloned in the pB42AD vector to re-test the interaction. Example 5 Agrobacterium-Mediated Transient Expression for Co-Immunoprecipitation, Sub-Cellular Localization and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation Experiments For the co-immunoprecipitation and sub-cellular localization experiments, the following previously described constructs were used: 35S::GRP7-eGFP (Fu et al., 2007, Nature, 447:284-288), 35S::EFR-3xHA (Schwessinger et al., 2011, PLoS Genet., 7:e1002046), 35S::FLS2-3xmyc (Chinchilla et al., 2006, Plant Cell, 18:465-76), 35S::BAK1-HA (Schwessinger et al., 2011, PLoS Genet., 7:e1002046), 35S::FLS2-GFP-His (Schwessinger et al., 2011, PLoS Genet., 7:e1002046) and 35S::HopU1-HA (Fu et al., 2007, Nature, 447:284-288). The Agrobacterium strains GV3101 carrying the indicated constructs were syringe-infiltrated in Nicotiana benthamiana or Nicotiana tabacum leaves at OD600=0.4-0.6 and samples were collected 2 days post-infiltration. For the bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, the coding regions of FLS2, EFR, GRP7 and HopU1 was cloned into the BiFC binary vectors, pAM-PAT-355, as previously described (Lefebvre et al., 2010, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 107:2343-2348). The Agrobacterium strain, GV3101, expressing the silencing suppressor P19 and carrying the indicated constructs were syringe-infiltrated in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves at OD600=0.4-0.6. Confocal analyses for the sub-cellular localization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments were performed 2 days post-infiltration using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Example 6 Protein Extraction, Co-Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Total proteins were extracted in a buffer including 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% Igepal and protease inhibitors (Sigma). For co-immunoprecipitation, anti-HA beads (Roche) or anti-GFP-TRAP-A beads (Chromotek) were incubated with total proteins and then washed with the extraction buffer. Proteins were fractioned on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) and then detected using specific antibodies. FLS2 was detected using specific polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit as primary antisera. The anti-S14-1 antibodies were obtained from a commercial supplier (Agrisera, Sweden). The rabbit anti-eIF4E antibody was a kind gift from Prof. A. Maule (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK). Epitope-tagged proteins were detected with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA-HRP (Santa Cruz); mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (AMS); or anti-HRP antibodies (Santa Cruz). The secondary anti-rabbit-HRP antibodies (Sigma) were used when appropriate. Immunodetection was performed with ECL chemiluminescence reagent (GE). Tandem mass spectrometry experiments were performed as previously described (Fu et al., 2007, Nature, 447:284-288). Example 7 In Vitro ADP-Ribosylation Assay HopU1-His, GRP7-GST and FLS2-GST were affinity-purified from Escherichia coli BL21 and the purity of the proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE. The ADP-ribosylation assay was performed as previously described (Fu et al., 2007, Nature, 447:284-288). Example 8 RNA-Immunoprecipitation Assay After UV-crosslinking treatments (120 MJ, 3 times using UV Stratalinker™ 2400, Stratagene), total proteins were extracted in extraction buffer including 50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mM PMSF, 10 units/mL RNaseOUT™ (Invitrogen) and protease inhibitors (Sigma). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche) or anti-GFP-TRAP-A beads (Chromotek). After this incubation, the beads were washed and the RNA-GRP7 complexes were eluted by incubating at 60° C. for 15 min in the elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3). A proteinase K treatment for 1 hour at 60° C. was then followed by RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR. In each experiment, transcript levels from the input were normalized in comparison to the control samples (grp7/GRP7-HA in FIGS. 1A, 6B and 14B; HopU1 in FIGS. 6A and 14A; and Col-0 in FIG. 15). The normalization of the transcript levels after RNA-IP was performed in comparison to the GRP7 transcript level in grp7/GRP7-HA or GRP7-GFP samples (FIGS. 5A, 6A-B, 14A-B) or the GRP8 transcript level (FIG. 15). Example 9 Quantitative RT-PCR After RNA extraction (Tri Reagent, Sigma-Aldrich), first strand cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCRs were performed from 1.5 μL of cDNA with SYBR® Green JumpStart™ Taq ReadyMix™ (Sigma-Aldrich) on a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, Mass.). Primers used have the following sequence: Ubox (At5g15400): (SEQ ID NOs: 1 & 2) 5′-TGCGCTGCCAGATAATACACTATT-3′ and 5′-TGCTGCCCAACATCAGGTT-3′ FLS2 (At5g46330): (SEQ ID NOs: 3 & 4) 5′-ACTCTCCTCCAGGGGCTAAGGAT-3′ and 5′-AGCTAACAGCTCTCCAGGGATGG-3′ EFR (At5g20480): (SEQ ID NOs: 5 & 6) 5′-CGGATGAAGCAGTACGAGAA-3′ and 5′-CCATTCCTGAGGAGAACTTTG-3′ BAK1 (At4g33430): (SEQ ID NOs: 7 & 8) 5′-ACCGCCTCCTATCTCTCCTACACC-3′ and 5′-CTGGGTCCTCTTCAGCTGGTACA-3′ GRP7 (At2g21660): (SEQ ID NOs: 9 & 10) 5′-TGATGACAGAGCTCTTGAGACTGCC-3′ and 5′-TCCTCCTCCACCCTCGCGTCTACCGCCGCCA-3′ GRP8 (At4g39260): (SEQ ID NOs: 11 & 12) 5′-CAATGATGAAGATCTTCAAAGGACG-3′ and 5′-CTCGTAACCACCACCGCCTCCTCCTGAGTATCC-3′ Example 10 Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay The 3′UTR sequence of FLS2 was amplified with the upstream primer GATGGTACCGAAGTTTAGCAGCAAAGC (SEQ ID NO:13) and the downstream primer GAGCTCGAGGTTCATCAAAACCAAATTTC (SEQ ID NO:14). The amplified fragment was subcloned into the plasmid pBSK(−) (Stratagene) and transcribed with T7 polymerase (Promega) in the presence of 10 μCi 32P CTP. The FLS2 3′UTR binding affinity was analyzed with purified GRP7-GST in 20 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.01% NP-40, 10 U SUPERase•In™ (Ambion), and 50 ng of 32P-labeled FLS2 3′UTR. For competition assays, unlabelled FLS2 3′UTR transcripts were added into the mixture of 2 mM GRP7-GST and 50 ng of 32P-labelled FLS2 3-UTR transcripts. The bound and free RNA probes were separated on 6% native PAGE and exposed to PhotoImage screen, then analyzed by Storm 860 scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Example 11 Statistical Analysis Statistical significances based on one-way ANOVA analyses were performed with Prism 5.01 software (GraphPad Software). Example 12 Modulation of GRP7 Level and Activity Affects Early and Late Immune Responses Previous results conclusively showed that loss of GRP7 impairs PTI and resistance to Pto DC3000 infection. To investigate the consequences of ectopic GRP7 expression, PTI and pathogen response was monitored in transgenic A. thaliana plants expressing untagged GRP7 under the control of the constitutive promoter 35S (GRP7ox lines; Streitner et al., 2008, Plant J., 56:239-50). An immunoblot analysis using a specific anti-GRP7 antibody confirmed higher GRP7 levels in transgenic homozygous GRP7ox plants in comparison to the wild-type (WT) Col-2 ecotype (FIG. 8). A. thaliana Col-2 (WT) and GRP7ox plants were treated with flg22, elf18, or chitin, which resulted in substantially higher ROS production in GRP7ox plants compared to WT (FIG. 1A). Similarly, callose deposition was increased in GRP7ox plants compared to WT plants after all three treatments (FIG. 1B). The A. thaliana GRP7ox plants were used in pathogenicity assays with Pto DC3000 or the Pto DC3000 hrcC+ mutant that does not secrete any T3SEs and is therefore severely hypo-virulent. Plants were spray-inoculated and bacteria were enumerated at 0 and 4 days after inoculation. Interestingly, GRP7ox plants were more resistant to infection by Pto DC3000 than WT plants (FIGS. 1C and D). The Pto DC3000 hrcC+ mutant exhibited unaltered growth on GRP7ox plants. This may be due to the strongly reduced virulence of the Pto DC3000 hrcC+ mutant that would require a more substantial improvement in plant immunity to further reduce the growth of this debilitated strain. The increased resistance to Pto DC3000 infection observed in plants over-expressing GRP7 clearly demonstrates its important role in innate immunity. Example 13 GRP7 is Required for Full Immunity to Pto DC3000 Wt and HrcC+, and HopU1 Targets GRP7 To assess the extent to which HopU1 inhibits PTI responses, early and late responses triggered by flg22 were analyzed in transgenic A. thaliana lines constitutively expressing HopU1 C-terminally tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) under the control of the 35S promoter. In HopU1 plants, the ROS burst induced by flg22 and elf18 treatment was reduced compared to WT plants (FIGS. 9A and B). Next, it was confirmed that HopU1 leaves exhibit less callose deposition upon flg22 treatment (FIG. 9C). These results were further validated using A. thaliana transgenic lines expressing HopU1-HA under the control of an estradiol-inducible promoter (ind_HopU1) (FIGS. 9D and E). Together, this demonstrates that HopU1 affects both early and late flg22-induced responses. To test whether in planta HopU1 expression affects A. thaliana disease resistance, bacterial growth was assayed after spray-inoculation with the Pto DC3000 strains WT, hrcC+, or ΔhopU1 that is hypo-virulent. HopU1 plants were more susceptible to all the strains tested (FIG. 9F), albeit to a lesser extent than fls2 null mutant plants consistent with the reduced flg22 sensitivity of HopU1 plants (FIGS. 9A and C-E). These results, together with previous results, indicate that the abundance and/or activity of GRP7 are both required and limiting for triggering optimal early and late PTI responses. Example 14 GRP7 Associates with the Immune Receptors FLS2 and EFR at the Plasma Membrane The importance of GRP7 for early PTI responses suggests that GRP7 may affect directly PRRs and/or associated proteins, or indirectly the expression and/or biogenesis of such proteins. Notably, GRP7 was identified in an unbiased yeast two-hybrid screen for EFR-interacting proteins (FIG. 10A). Importantly, this interaction was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments after transient co-expression of EFR and GRP7 as C-terminally tagged fusion proteins with HA and enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) tags (EFR-3xHA and GRP7-eGFP, respectively) in Nicotiana benthamiana (FIG. 2A). Similarly, GRP7 and FLS2 also interacted when transiently co-expressed as fusion proteins (FLS2-3xmyc and GRP7-eGFP) in N. benthamiana (FIG. 2B). However, GRP7-eGFP did not interact under similar conditions with the LRR-RK BAK1 (BAK1-HA) (FIG. 2C), which is an important positive regulator of PTI responses downstream of FLS2 and EFR. The GRP7-FLS2 association was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in an A. thaliana transgenic line expressing GRP7 C-terminally tagged with a GFP epitope (GRP7-GFP) under the control of the 35S promoter and using an anti-FLS2 antibody recognizing the native FLS2 protein (FIG. 2D). The GRP7-FLS2 interaction occurred independently of elicitation and was unaltered by flg22 treatment (FIG. 2D). The presence of fully glycosylated EFR and FLS2 proteins (migrating at ˜150 kDa and ˜175 kDa, respectively) in the GRP7 immunoprecipitates (FIGS. 2A, B and D) suggests that the association between GRP7 and PRRs occurs at the plasma membrane once the mature and functional PRRs have migrated through the secretory pathway. GRP7-GFP shows a nucleo-cytoplasmic subcellular localization in A. thaliana, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and N. benthamiana cells upon stable or transient expression (FIGS. 11A and B). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments using split-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) following transient expression in N. benthamiana suggest that the GRP7-FLS2 interaction is direct (FIG. 2E). This interaction occurs most likely at the plasma membrane, as indicated by the presence of the reconstituted YFP signal in typical cell wall-plasma membrane connections (called Hechtian strands) after cell plasmolysis (arrows in FIG. 2E). An interaction at the plasma membrane between GRP7 and EFR could also be observed (FIG. 10B). Example 15 GRP7 Associates with Translational Components In exploratory experiments to identify GRP7 interactors in planta by immunoprecipitation using an A. thaliana transgenic line expressing GRP7 C-terminally tagged with HA under the control of its native promoter (GRP7-HA), several components of the 43S complex involved in protein translation were identified by mass-spectrometry analysis of the GRP7-HA immunoprecipitates (Table 8). Before the initiation of active translation, the 43S complex recruits both mRNAs and ribosomes, and is composed of several initiation factors in addition to the cap-binding protein eIF4E and the ribosomal 40S subunit. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the A. thaliana GRP7-GFP transgenic line and specific antibodies further revealed the presence of eIF4E and the ribosomal subunit S14 in complex with GRP7 (FIG. 3). The GRP7-GFP line was used here for consistency with previous targeted co-immunoprecipitation experiments (FIG. 2). Interestingly, slower-migrating bands of eIF4E were enriched in GRP7-GFP immunoprecipitates in comparison to the main form detected in the input (see asterisks in FIG. 3). Strikingly, treatment with flg22 induced the dissociation of eIF4E and S14 from the GRP7 complex (FIG. 3), indicating a potential dynamic link between GRP7, ligand-activated PRRs and components of the translational machinery. Example 16 HopU1 Does Not Affect Interactions Between GRP7, PRRs and Translational Components Next, it was tested whether HopU1 could directly affect FLS2 or the GRP7-FLS2 interaction. HopU1 did not interact with FLS2 in vivo as determined by co-immunoprecipitation and split-YFP experiments in N. benthamiana (FIG. 12A, B). Consistently, HopU1 did not mono-ADP-ribosylate FLS2 in vitro (FIG. 12C). Although HopU1 directly interacts with GRP7 in vivo (FIG. 13), HopU1 did not affect the interaction between GRP7 and FLS2 in an A. thaliana transgenic line expressing both GRP7-GFP and HopU1-HA (FIG. 4). In addition, HopU1 did not interfere with the association between GRP7-GFP and either eIF4E or S14 (FIG. 4). Therefore, the effect of HopU1 on PTI responses is most likely not mediated by direct inhibition of PRRs or protein-protein interactions with GRP7. Example 17 GRP7 Associates with FLS2 and EFR Transcripts in Planta Next, the role of GRP7 in PTI was investigated in relation to its capacity to bind RNA by testing if GRP7 could bind PRR transcripts. Quantitative RNA-immunoprecipitation assays using the A. thaliana GRP7-HA transgenic line revealed that GRP7 binds FLS2 mRNAs in vivo independently of flg22 treatment (FIG. 5A). As positive controls, it was confirmed that GRP7 binds its own transcripts as well as transcripts of its closest paralog GRP8 (FIG. 5A), as previously reported in vitro. GRP7 binds the 3′-UTR of its own transcript and of the GRP8 mRNA. Similarly, the 3′-UTR was identified as a binding region of GRP7 in the FLS2 mRNA (FIG. 5B, C). In addition to the FLS2 mRNA, GRP7 could also bind the EFR transcript in vivo (FIG. 14A), consistent with the importance of GRP7 for responses triggered by both flg22 and elf18 (FIG. 1). However, transcripts of the regulatory LRR-RK BAK1 were not enriched in GRP7 immunoprecipitates (FIGS. 5A and 14A), revealing a certain degree of specificity. Interestingly, GRP8, which is also targeted by HopU1, is also able to bind FLS2 and EFR mRNAs (FIG. 15). These results demonstrate that GRP7, as well as GRP8, bind transcripts of the important PRRs FLS2 and EFR. Example 18 HopU1 Disrupts the Association Between GRP7 and PRR Transcripts Next, it was investigated whether HopU1 could affect the ability of GRP7 to bind its target mRNAs, including FLS2 and EFR transcripts. Using an A. thaliana transgenic line expressing both GRP7-GFP and HopU1-HA in quantitative RNA-immunoprecipitation assays, it was found that the amount of FLS2 and EFR transcripts bound to GRP7-GFP was strongly reduced in the presence of HopU1 (FIGS. 6A and 14A). A similar effect was observed on the interaction between GRP7 and its own mRNA (FIGS. 6A and 14A). Furthermore, a GRP7(R49K) variant, which carries a mutation in a conserved arginine residue within the RRM RNA-binding domain that is mono-ADP-ribosylated by HopU1, is strongly impaired in its ability to bind FLS2, EFR, GRP7 and GRP8 transcripts (FIGS. 6B and 14B). Together, these results demonstrate that the mono-ADP-ribosylation of GRP7 by HopU1 disrupts in planta the ability of GRP7 to bind mRNAs of the PRRs FLS2 and EFR. Example 19 HopU1 Inhibits the Pathogen-Induced FLS2 Protein Accumulation During Pseudomonas Infection Because HopU1 inhibits GRP7-FLS2 mRNA binding (FIG. 6), it was asked whether HopU1's action could ultimately affect FLS2 protein levels after translocation into A. thaliana cells during Pto DC3000 infection, which would correspond to the most biologically-relevant observation. It was observed that the amount of FLS2 protein increases (3.6 to 3.8-fold) over 24 hours in leaves infected with Pto DC3000 hrcC+ (unable to secrete any T3SEs and therefore unable to dampen PTI) (FIG. 7A), consistent with the previous observation that the expression of FLS2, EFR and other potential PRR-encoding genes is PAMP-inducible (see, for example, Zipfel et al., 2006, Cell, 125:749-760; and Zipfel et al., 2004, Nature, 428:764-767). Notably, this PAMP-induced accumulation is attenuated by T3SEs (FIG. 7A; compare hrcC+ with WT). However, this T3SE-mediated suppression was much less marked after inoculation with Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 (FIG. 7A; compare ΔhopU1 with WT). Importantly, expression of HopU1 in trans on a plasmid in Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 restored the inhibition of FLS2 accumulation during infection, while trans-complementation with the catalytically inactive HopU1DD variant did not (FIG. 7B). Notably, while the amount of cellular FLS2 mRNA increased during the first hours of infection with Pto DC3000 hrcC+, it decreased to a similar level upon infection with Pto DC3000 WT and ΔhopU1 (FIG. 7C). The contrasting regulation and sensitivity to HopU1 of FLS2 mRNA and protein levels during infection further demonstrate that HopU1 regulates FLS2 post-transcriptionally, while other T3SEs already regulate FLS2 at the transcriptional level. Consistent with FLS2 being an important virulence target for HopU1, it was found that deletion of the flagellin-encoding gene FliC in the ΔhopU1 background (Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 ΔfliC) suppress the virulence defect of Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 and restore the virulence of Pto DC3000 ΔhopU1 ΔfliC to a comparable level as Pto DC3000 ΔfliC on WT A. thaliana plants (FIG. 7D). Together, these results indicate that HopU1 strongly affects the increased accumulation of FLS2 protein level normally observed during the first hours of A. thaliana infection by Pto DC3000. Part B Overexpression in Soybean Example 1 Analysis of Soybean Genome Sequence analysis of the soybean genome was performed to identify putative glycine-rich RNA binding proteins. The RNA-binding domain from the A. thaliana GRP7 protein was used as the query in the sequence analysis, and 12 soybean genes were identified. See the Table below and FIG. 16. % sequence SEQ ID identity to NO A. thaliana (nucleic GRP7 (over acid, the RNA- amino binding Gene* Gene Name* acid) domain Glyma05g00400.1 gmGRBP1d/GRBP1c/ 15, 16 46 GRBP1e-1 Glyma05g00400.2 gmGRBP1d/GRBP1c/ 17, 18 46 GRBP1e-1 Glyma08g26900.1 gmGRBP1d/GRBP1c/ 19, 20 56 GRBP1e-2 Glyma11g36580.1 gmGRBP1d/GRBP1c/ 21, 22 46 GRBP1e-3 Glyma17g08630.1 gmGRBP1d/GRBP1c/ 23, 24 46 GRBP1e-4 Glyma18g00480.1 gmGRBP1d/GRBP1c/ 25, 26 46 GRBP1e-5 Glyma18g00480.2 gmGRBP1d/GRBP1c/ 27, 28 45 GRBP1e-5 Glyma18g50150.1 gmGRBP1d/GRBP1c/ 29, 30 58 GRBP1e-6 Glyma06g01470.1 gmGRP7/gmGRBP3a-1 31, 32 75 Glyma11g12480.1 gmGRP7/gmGRBP3a-2 33, 34 81 Glyma11g12490.1 gmGRP7/gmGRBP3a-3 35, 36 80 Glyma11g12510.2 gmGRP7/gmGRBP3a-4 37, 38 74 *from PlantGDB website The nucleic acid and amino acid sequence of AtGRP is shown in SEQ ID NOs: 39 & 40, respectively. Two of the soybean sequences with the highest homology were analyzed in more detail. The putative RNA-binding portion of the sequence identified as Glyma06g01470 (SEQ ID NO:32) was determined to have 75% sequence identity to the RNA-binding portion of the A. thaliana GRP7 sequence. In addition, the putative RNA-binding portion of the sequence identified as Glyma11g12480 (SEQ ID NO:34) was determined to have 81% sequence identity to the RNA-binding portion of the A. thaliana GRP7 sequence. Significantly, both soybean sequences were determined to have Arginines at positions 47 and 49 (R47 and R49). Example 2 Transformation of Soybean and Identification of Transgenic Plants The coding sequences from the soybean genes were cloned into the binary vector, pPTN200, which is a member of the pPZP family of binary vectors (see, for example, Hajdukiewicz et al., 1994, Plant Mol. Biol., 25:989-94). The soybean sequences were placed under control of the 35S Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) promoter with a duplicated enhancer (Benfey & Chua, 1990, Science, 250:959-66) and terminated by its 3′ UTR. The binary vector was introduced into soybean using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Specifically, the cotyledonary node system was used to generate transgenic soybean plants (see, for example, Hinchee et al., 1988, Bio/Technol., 6:915-22). The pPTN200 vector carries a bar gene (Thompson et al., 1987, EMBO, 6:2519-23) under the control of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase promoter (Pnos) and terminated using the 3′ UTR of the nopaline synthase gene. Therefore, selection of transformants was performed using the herbicide, Basta. Example 3 Evaluating the Plants' Response to Biotic Stress Transgenic soybean plants overexpressing one or more of the soybean sequences are exposed to PAMP and their levels of callose and ROS are determined as an indicator of the immune response. In addition, transgenic soybean plants overexpressing one or more of the soybean sequences are challenged with a number of pathogens to determine the plants' innate immunity response. For example, the transgenic soybean plants are exposed to bacterial pathogens such as, without limitation, Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea (bacterial blight);viral pathogens including, for example, tobacco ringspot virus (bud blight) or soybean mosaic virus (soybean mosaic);fungal pathogens such as Septoria glycines (brown spot), Diaporthe phaseolorum (pod and stem blight), Peronospora manshurica (downy mildew), Phytophthora sojae (Phytophthora rot), Rhizoctonia solani (Rhizoctonia stem rot), Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Sclerotinia stem rot), Phialophora gregata (brown stem rot), Fusarium solani (sudden death syndrome), or Macrophomina phaseolina (charcoal root rot). In addition to identifying visual indicators of pathogenicity (e.g., compared to a non-transgenic control plant), the presence and/or amount of one or more pathogens remaining on the plant is obtained (e.g., using bacterial or fungal spore counts or molecules techniques such as, for example, Southern blotting) compared to that remaining on a non-transgenic plant. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that the list of soybean pathogens provided herein is not exhaustive and is intended only to be exemplary. See, for example, Compendium of Soybean Diseases, 4th Ed., 1999, Hartman et al., eds., Amer. Phytopathol. Soc. The transgenic soybean plants generally exhibit more resistance than non-transgenic soybean plants.
