Preparation of N-(3-amino-2,6-dichlorophenyl)acetamide (C321)
Step 1: Preparation of tert-butyl (3-acetamido-2,4-dichlorophenyl)carbamate. 3-Acetamido-2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (1 g, 4.03 mmol) was added portionwise to a stirred solution of diphenylphosphoryl azide (1.47 g, 5.34 mmol), and triethylamine (0.54 g, 5.34 mmol) in anhydrous tert-butanol (25 mL). The resulting gold solution was heated at 80° C. for 1 hour, then cooled and quenched with water (20 mL). The resulting aqueous mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (2×50 mL) and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (50 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (50 mL). The organic extracts were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum on a rotary evaporator. Purification by flash silica gel column chromatography using 0-30% ethyl acetate in hexanes as eluent gave the title compound as a white solid (0.72 g, 44%):
