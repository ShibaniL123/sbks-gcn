Step 2: To a mixture of 5-amino-2-chloro-3-fluorobenzoic acid (C196) (0.357 g, 1.88 mmol) and triethylamine (0.334 g, 3.30 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (15 mL) was added a solution of the freshly prepared acid chloride, (1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carbonyl chloride (0.474 g, 1.57 mmol), dropwise at 0° C., and the resulting green solution was stirred under nitrogen while warming to room temperature over a 1-hour period, and then stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated to a dark oil, and the oil was partitioned between ethyl acetate (100 mL) and 1 normal aqueous hydrogen chloride (25 mL). The phases were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with additional ethyl acetate (25 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine (50 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to an amber oil. The oil was dissolved in minimal ethyl acetate and adsorbed to Celite®. The adsorbed material was purified by reverse-phase, automated flash chromatography using a gradient of 10-100% acetonitrile in water as eluent to give the title compound as a light tan solid (0.398 g, 55%): mp 205-208° C.;
