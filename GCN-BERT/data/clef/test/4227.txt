Field of the Invention In at least one aspect, the present invention relates to the synthesis of multidentate organic ligands, the use of these ligands is to form porous coordination polymers and their application as sorbents or catalyst components. 2. Background Art Microporous materials are in high demand because of their ability to adsorb a wide variety of guest molecules. These sorption properties make microporous materials attractive for applications such as storage, separation or catalysis. Optimization of these applications requires a combination of high surface area, tunable functionality, and defined pore structure. Among different classes of microporous materials, coordination polymers have demonstrated a high efficiency for the uptake of several gases and organic molecules. The periodicity of such systems and the ability to modulate the pore size and surface area through modification of either the organic linker or metal cluster have made coordination polymers extremely appealing for sorption and storage applications. A few benchmark coordination polymers which are developed for these purposes include MOF-5 and HKUST-1. Although the prior art microporous materials work reasonably well, there are a number of unsolved concerns. For example, many materials have relatively low surface areas and pore volumes, with broad pore size distributions. Against this prior art background, there is still a desire for novel multidentate ligands that are useful for constructing porous materials. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention solves one or more problems of the prior art by providing a compound that is useful as a linking ligand or a precursor to a linking ligand for forming porous materials.

Synthesis of 1,3,5-tris(3′,5′-dicarboxybiphenyl-4-yl)benzene and UMCM-450b Organic ligand (1,3,5-tris(3′,5′-dicarboxybiphenyl-4-yl)benzene) is synthesized by Suzuki coupling of 1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene with dimethyl isophthalate-5-pinacolboronate, followed by hydrolysis of the ester groups using KOH in dioxane/H2O and acidic workup. This route afforded compound (1,3,5-tris(3′,5′-dicarboxybiphenyl-4-yl)benzene) in an unoptimized 54% yield. 1,3,5-tris(3′,5′-dicarboxybiphenyl-4-yl)benzene 1,3,5-Tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene (0.980 g, 1.81 mmol), dimethyl isophthalate-5-pinacolboronate (2.08 g, 6.50 mmol), K3PO4 (tribasic, 3.84 g, 18.1 mmol) and 1,4-dioxane (100 mL) are added into a 200 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and water jacketed condenser. The resulting suspension is degassed for 15 min. by sparging with nitrogen gas. Pd(PPh3)4 (0.157 g, 0.136 mmol) is added, and the mixture is heated to reflux overnight under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture is poured in H2O (100 mL) and the precipitate is collected by filtration and washed with a minimal amount of THF. The crude material is dissolved in dioxane/H2O (10:1, 110 mL), KOH (1.72 g, 30.6 mmol) is added and the mixture is heated to reflux for 12 hours. The solvent is removed by evaporation and the residue is dissolved in H2O (100 mL). The residual solids are filtered off and the filtrate is acidified with concentrated HCl (20 mL).

UMCM-450b 1,3,5-tris(3′,5′-dicarboxybiphenyl-4-yl)benzene (0.0500 g, 0.0626 mmol), concentrated HCl (0.025 mL) and Cu(NO3)2.2.5H2O (0.0705 g, 0.376 mmol) are added in DMF/dioxane/H2O (10:4:1, 15 mL) and the solids are dissolved with heating. The solution is placed in a tightly screwed 20 mL vial and heated at 85° C. for 18 h. The mother liquor is removed and replaced twice with fresh DMF and then with acetone. The acetone is replaced with fresh solvent three times over a period of three days. The crystals are then placed in a Schlenk tube and dried under vacuum at ambient temperature until the material started to change color to deep purple. The crystals are further evacuated at 100° C. under vacuum for 1-2 h to yield 0.0390 g of activated UMCM-450b (0.0357 mmol as blue-green crystals, 57% based on the formula determined by elemental analysis): mp>300° C. (dec.); PXRD (Cu-κα1, 1.5418 Å) 2θ (°) approx. 3.1 (100%), 6.1 (22%), 7.3 (15%), 8.2 (11%), 9.6 (25%), 11.1 (11%), 12.1 (8%), 12.9 (18%); Anal. calcd. for C48H24O12Cu3.1.5 DMF: C, 57.69; H, 3.18; N, 1.92. found: C, 57.31; H, 2.93; N, 2.30. X-ray diffraction of a single crystal of UMCM-450b revealed a cubic structure (Space group Fm-3m, with a approximately equal to 47.3 Å) (FIGS. 1a-b) where each organic linker molecule is bound to nine neighboring linker molecules through six Cu2(carboxylate)4 clusters, a pair of Cu clusters binding three neighbor molecules (FIG. 1c). The crystal structure is comprised of three different types of cage-like compartments: spherical cages formed by 24 organic linker molecules linked together through 12 Cu clusters (FIG. 2d), tetrahedral cages where each face corresponds to a linker molecule and each vertex is bound to a spherical cage (FIG. 1e), and octahedral cages where each face corresponds to a linker molecule and each vertex is bound to a spherical cage (FIG. 1f). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of a sample of UMCM-450b exchanged with acetone (11.6360 mg) heated at a rate of 5° C./min from 25 to 400° C. (FIG. 2) showed an initial weight loss corresponding to about 40% between about 25 and 85° C., which can be attributed to loss of guest solvent. A weight loss of about 9% between about 85 and 280° C. may correspond to the loss of solvent molecules bound more tightly to the Cu atoms. Finally, a weight loss of about 12.5% above 300° C. is observed. The N2 sorption isotherm is measured on an evacuated sample of UMCM-450b. The isotherm showed a type IV-like behavior with no hysteresis upon desorption (FIG. 3). The material shows a minor step at about a p/po=0.08-0.09 in the N2 isotherm followed by a second step that reaches saturation at approximately 895 cc/g. Using this data, a total pore volume of 1.4 cm3/g has been determined, and the apparent specific surface area is calculated using the Langmuir method and is estimated to be 3800 m2/g. The Ar sorption isotherm is collected on the same sample and shows a similar behavior (FIG. 4). Pore size distribution for UMCM-450b is determined from the Ar isotherm at 87 K and revealed the presence of micropores 10.5-11.5 Å and 12.5-13 Å in diameter, along with a smaller distribution of mesopores 21-23 Å in diameter (FIG. 5). 2.

Palladium tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) is purchased from Pressure Chemical. Methyl 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid is prepared from 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid (Frontier Scientific) according to a published procedure. All other reagents are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Acros. All reagents and solvents are used as received. Biphenyl-3,4′,5-tricarboxylic acid Dimethyl 5-bromoisophthalate (8.15 g, 29.9 mmol), methyl 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid (5.91 g, 32.8 mmol), K2CO3 (8.29 g, 60.0 mmol), toluene (60 mL), ethanol (30 mL) and water (30 mL) are added into a 200 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and water jacketed condenser. The resulting suspension is degassed for 15 min by sparging with nitrogen gas. Pd(PPh3)4 (0.862 g, 0.746 mmol) is added, and the mixture is heated to reflux overnight under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature both layers are separated, the organic layer is dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The residue is filtered on a short silica plug using acetone as eluent and the solvent is removed by evaporation. The crude product is dissolved in dioxane (50 mL) and an aqueous KOH solution (9 M, 50 mL) is added. This mixture is heated to reflux for 12 h. The solvent is evaporated then the residue is dissolved in H2O (100 mL). The residual solids are filtered off and the filtrate is acidified with concentrated HCl (20 mL). The target compound is collected by filtration, washed with H2O and acetone and dried under vacuum to yield 5.15 g of biphenyl-3,4′,5-tricarboxylic acid (18.0 mmol as a white powder, 60%): mp>300° C.; 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 13.23 (br s, 3H), 8.41 (d, J=1.0 Hz, 1H), 8.33 (t, J=1.0 Hz, 2H), 7.99 (d, J=8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.77 (d, J=8.0 Hz, 2H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 167.4, 166.8, 142.8, 140.3, 132.6, 131.8, 130.8, 130.6, 129.9, 127.4; HRMS (EI) calcd. for C15H10O6 (m/e): 286.0477. found: 286.0485; Anal.

The solution is placed in a tightly capped 20 mL vial and heated at 85° C. for 6 hours. Upon cooling the mother liquor is removed and replaced twice with fresh DMF and then with acetone. The acetone is replaced with fresh solvent three times over a period of three days. The crystals are then placed in a Schlenk tube and dried under vacuum at ambient temperature until the material started to change color to deep purple. The crystals are further evacuated at 100° C. for 1-2 hours to yield 0.052 g of activated UMCM-150 (0.137 mmol as blue-green crystals, 78% based on fully evacuated material): mp>300° C. (dec); PXRD (Cu Kα, 1.5418 Å) 2θ (I/I0): 4.3 (44%), 6.9 (100%), 8.7 (29%), 10.3 (24%), 10.8 (27%), 11.7 (17%), 14.0 (38%); Anal. Calcd for C15H7O6Cu1.5: C, 47.59; H, 1.86. Found: C, 47.19; H, 2.07. The structure of UMCM-150 is solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction in the space group P63/mmc. Views of the crystal lattice along the a and c axes are provided in FIGS. 6a and 6b. From the X-ray data, the carboxylates on the 3- and 5-positions (same ring) of the linker each form Cu paddlewheel clusters with three neighboring molecules. Notably, the carboxylate on the 4′-position assembles into a Cu3(O2CR)6 cluster (FIG. 6c), UMCM-150 derives from a [3,4,6]-connected net consisting of three types of cage-like structures. One type of cage possesses a hexagonal bipyramidal shape with an aperture (accounting for the van der Waals radii) of approximately 5.2 Å×5.8 Å (FIG. 6d). The walls of the cages are formed by the faces of six linker molecules. Trinuclear Cu clusters are located in the apical positions whereas Cu paddlewheels occupy the equatorial positions. The second type of cage possesses a trigonal bipyramidal shape with a larger aperture of 10.2 Å×13.7 Å. In the apical positions small cylindrical pores about 4.2 Å in diameter resulting from the assembly of three linker molecules by three paddlewheels are observed; Cu3 clusters are located in the equatorial positions and linker molecules occupy the faces (FIG. 6e). The third type of cage possesses all three different apertures observed in the other two types of cages (FIG. 6f). Each apical position of the cage is formed from three paddlewheels and three linker molecules pointing outward, while three Cu3 clusters are located in the equatorial positions. The edges of twelve linker molecules form the cage walls. Notably, for the first two types of cages only aromatic groups face towards the inside, whereas the axial coordination sites of the Cu paddlewheels are directed inward in the third type of cage. Thermogravimetric measurements are taken on a TA Q50 TGA apparatus. Samples (typically 5-10 mg) are loaded on a platinum pan, and the temperature is ramped at 5° C./min from 30 to 400° C. Thermogravimetric analysis of this material reveals rapid solvent loss over the temperature range of 25-125° C. reaching a plateau from 125-150° C. A 6.7% weight loss observed from 150-225° C. is attributed to molecules bound to Cu atoms. (FIG. 7). Removal of the solvent from the framework by evacuation at 100° C. for 4 hours leads to a change in color of the material to deep purple. The evacuated material is formulated as Cu3(C15H7O6)2 by elemental analysis and this assignment is corroborated by X-ray crystallography (vide infra) No significant change in the PXRD pattern is observed after solvent. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms are measured volumetrically at 77 K in the range 1.00×10−3≦P/Po≦1.00 with an Autosorb-1C outfitted with the micropore option by Quantachrome Instruments (Boynton Beach, Fla. USA), running version 1.2 of the ASWin software package. Ultra-high purity He (99.999%, for void volume determination) and N2 (99.999%) are purchased from Cryogenic Gasses and used as received. The N2 adsorption isotherm (FIG. 8) of UMCM-150 reveals type I behavior with no hysteresis upon desorption. From this data, a total pore volume of 1.0 cm3/g is determined, and the apparent surface area is calculated using the Langmuir method to be 3100 m2/g (2300 m2/g BET), thus confirming the permanent porosity of UMCM-150. Ar adsorption/desorption isotherms are measured similarly (FIG. 9). Ultra-high purity Ar (99.999%) is purchased from Cryogenic Gasses and used as received. Pore size distributions (FIG. 10) are determined by analyzing the Ar isotherm at 87 K using nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) implementing a hybrid kernel for argon adsorption at liquid-argon temperature based on a zeolite/silica model containing cylindrical pores as implemented in the ASW in software package. Ar adsorption yields the following pore distribution diameters: 6.5-8 Å, 10.5-12 Å, and 12.5-13 Å. These pore sizes are consistent with the three types of cages observed in the crystal structure. The H2 adsorption isotherm recorded at 77K shows type I behavior with no hysteresis and no noticeable change in properties upon repeated cycling. UMCM-150 shows an excess gravimetric H2 uptake of 1.9 wt % at 1 bar (FIG. 11), which indicates the presence of high affinity sites. High pressure studies on UMCM-150 revealed 5.7 wt % at 45 bar (FIG. 11). From the crystallographic density of the fully evacuated material (0.636 g/cm3), an upper limit on the excess volumetric uptake could be estimated as 36 g/L. These values are among the highest reported for both excess gravimetric and volumetric H2 uptake by a reversible sorbent.
