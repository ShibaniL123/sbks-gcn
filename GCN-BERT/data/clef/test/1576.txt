Between the stirring frame 55 and the swing member 53, biasing means 113 is provided. The biasing means 113 is configured to include a coil spring; connected between the back wall 55e of the stirring frame 55 and the bottom wall 53d of the swing member 53; and biases the swing member 53 toward the pan 3 side with respect to the stirring frame 55 so as to bring the stirring spatula 50 into contact with the inner surface of the pan 3. As illustrated in FIGS. 7 to 9, at the fore end of the rotary shaft 48, a holder 116 into which the base part of the stirrer 8 is inserted and fitted is provided, and the holder 116 has a holder body 117 and a holder cover 118. The holder body 117 is formed in a tubular shape of which the inner circumferential surface forms a circular shape and the outer circumferential surface forms a hexagonal shape in cross section, and removably screwed, attached, and fixed to the fore end part of the rotary shaft 48. On the fore end side of the holder body 117, an L-shaped locking groove 121 that is adapted to lock an engaging pin 120 provided at the base part of the stirrer 8 by turning the engaging pin 120 after insertion of the engaging pin 120 in the shaft direction is formed. The holder cover 118 is formed in a hexagonal tubular shape corresponding to the outer circumferential surface of the holder body 117, and fitted to the outside of the holder body 117 slidably in the shaft direction. On the fore end side of the holder cover 118, an engaging groove 122 is formed in the shaft direction from the fore end of the holder cover 118, and the engaging groove 122 engages with the engaging pin 120 inserted to the inner part of the locking groove 121. The engaging pin 120 is adapted to engage with the holder cover 118 to be blocked from coming off from the locking groove 121, and thereby prevent the stirrer 8 from turning and coming off. On the fore end side of the rotary shaft 48 and on the base end side of the holder body 117, a lock nut 124 is screwed; on the fore end side of the lock nut 124 in the holder body 117, a pair of spring holders 125 and 126 are fitted from outside; between the pair of spring holders 125 and 126, a coil spring 127 is fitted from outside, and biases the holder cover 118 toward the fore end side of the holder body 117 through the spring holder 126; and in doing so, the engaging groove 122 is prevented from coming off from the engaging pin 120. As described, the base part of the stirrer 8 is inserted and fitted into the holder body 117 and the fore end side of the rotary shaft 48 and prevented from turning, and thereby the stirrer 8 is integrally rotatably attached to the rotary shaft 48 so as to protrude outward. The stirrer 8 includes a spiral rod 130 that slidingly contacts with the inner surface of the pan 3. The spiral rod 130 is formed by spirally bending a rod having a quadrangular cross-section, and as indicated by long dashed double-short dashed lines in FIG. 11, a push-out surface 130a of the spiral rod 130, which is adapted to push out food materials toward the pan bottom 39a side, is arranged perpendicular to the inner surface of the pan 3, which is curved and rises on the outer side of the pan bottom 39a. The push-out surface 130a is perpendicular to the pan 3, and can therefore surely cut food materials such as egg adhering to the inner surface of the pan 3. In the stirrer 8, stirring blades 133 adapted to lift food materials are protruded at intervals in the longer direction on the spiral rod 130 that slidingly contacts with the inner surface of the pan 3. In each of the stirring blades 133, an attachment base part 134 protruding from the spiral rod 130 toward the pan bottom 39a is provided with a tilted blade piece 135, and the tilted blade piece 135 protrudes in a direction away from the inner surface of the pan 3. Each of the stirring blades 133 is adapted to narrow an attachment part to the spiral rod 130 to prevent food materials from accumulating between the spiral rod 130 and the stirring blade 133 or to be able to easily drop down the food materials. The spiral rod 130 is brought into contact with the pan 3 at one point in the spiral direction. In order to make the number of contact points with the pan 3 equal to one, a spiral of the spiral rod 130 is set to less than 360 degrees. In the case where the spiral rod 130 has the length corresponding to 360 degrees or more, the base end side may be separated from the pan 3 when the fore end side contacts; however, a spiral of less than 360 degrees ensures the contact on the base end side. Note that at the contact point, the spiral rod 130 rotates in a direction opposite to the rotating direction of the pan 3. The control means 12 is configured to include a microcomputer, a memory, and the like, and as described above, has the control panel 11 as well as, as illustrated in FIG. 12, having: a registration part 139 that prepares a below-described working menu for each of multiple recipes to register the working menu; and a performing part 140 that performs a working menu selected from the registration part 139. Also, the control means 12 has a step shift part 141 that sounds a buzzer at the time of a below-described small process shift. In addition, although illustration is omitted, the buzzer is attached on the back surface or the like of the control panel 11. Also, the control means 12 makes it possible to, in a below-described manual working mode and step contents setting mode, set the length of a working time, set the level of the heating power of the heating means 6 in multiple stages, set the level of a stirrer rotating speed in multiple stages, and set the level of a pan rotating speed in multiple stages. More specifically, the length of the working time can be set in seconds; the level of the heating power of the heating means 6 can be set in multiple stages of extinction (0), 1 (low), 2, 3, 4, to 5 (high); the level of the stirrer rotating speed can be set in multiple stages of a stop (0), 1st gear speed, 2nd gear speed, 3rd gear speed, 4th gear speed, and 5th gear speed; and the level of the pan rotating speed can be set in multiple stages of a stop (0), 1st gear speed, 2nd gear speed, 3rd gear speed, 4th gear speed, and 5th gear speed. Next, basic control actions by the control means 12, and an operating method through the control panel 11 are described. (1) First, working modes are described. The working modes by the control means 12 include a manual working mode (menu number 1), menu working mode (menu numbers 1 to 10), and step contents setting mode. The manual working mode is a mode in which a user performs working not according to a set recipe, but while making settings each time. The menu working mode is a mode in which working is performed according to a recipe (working menu) corresponding to a menu number (1 to 10) selected with ten key switches. The step contents setting mode is a mode in which working contents corresponding to a selected menu are set to prepare a working menu. (2) Next, respective display parts and operation switches of the control panel 11 are described. In FIG. 13, the control panel 11 includes a pan rotating speed display part 143, stirrer rotating speed display part 144, heating power display part 145, working time display part 146, and menu number display part 147.

Pressing down the ten key switch SW4 increases the working time (Δ), whereas pressing down the ten key switch SW9 decreases the working time (∇). Pressing down the ten key switch SW5 and pressing down the ten key switch SW10 are disabled. (3) Next, manual working and an operating method for the manual working are described. <1> By pressing down the reset switch 156, a selected menu is set to the number 0 (the number 0 corresponds to a code for the manual working). <2> By pressing down the setting switch 157, the setting mode is activated. <3> With the ten key switches SW1 to SW10, the pan rotating speed and the stirrer rotating speed at the start are set. <4> By pressing down the setting switch 157, the setting mode is completed. Note that the operations in <2> to <4> are omitted in the case where setting contents are not changed. <5> With the ignition/distinction switch 151, the burner is ignited to start preheating working. <6> By pressing down the rotation/stop switch 153, the stirrer and the pan are started to rotate. <7> A user adjusts the heating power, pan rotating speed, and stirrer rotating speed with the ten key switches SW1 to SW10 according to a recipe. <8> By pressing down the ignition/extinction switch 151, the burner is extinguished, and by pressing down the rotation/stop switch 153, the stirring is stopped and completed. In addition, the working time display part 146 displays a stirring working time or an elapsed time. (4) Next, the configuration of menu working is described. As illustrated in FIG. 14, the control means 12 makes it possible to divide the entire process of a recipe into multiple small processes (e.g., five steps of Step A, Step B, Step C, Step D, and Step E), and for each of the small processes, set the length of the working time, the level of the heating power of the heating means 6 in the multiple stages, the level of the stirrer rotating speed in the multiple stages, and the level of the pan rotating speed in the multiple stages. More specifically, for each of up to the five steps of Step A, Step B, Step C, Step D, and Step E, the length of the working time can be set in seconds; the level of the heating power of the heating means 6 can be set in the multiple stages of extinction (0), 1 (low), 2, 3, 4, and 5 (high); the level of the stirrer rotating speed can be set in the multiple stages of the stop (0), 1st gear speed, 2nd gear speed, 3rd gear speed, 4th gear speed, and 5th gear speed; and the level of the pan rotating speed can be set in the multiple stages of the stop (0), 1st gear speed, 2nd gear speed, 3rd gear speed, 4th gear speed, and 5th gear speed. Accordingly, in one working menu, up to the five steps, and the heating power and stirring speeds (pan rotating speed, stirrer rotating speed) for each of the working times can be set. In addition, for each of the small processes, the working time, heating power, pan rotating speed, and stirrer rotating speed are set to prepare a working menu for cooking, and then the multiple small processes are sequentially performed to perform the working menu. Further, for each of multiple recipes, a working menu is prepared and registered in the registration part 139, and then one of the registered working menus is selected to perform the working menu in the performing part 140. Still further, for each of step shifts from a current small step to a next small step, the number of buzzer sounding times is set, and in the case of sequentially performing the multiple small processes to perform a working menu, the step shift part 141 sounds the buzzer just sounding times set for each of the step shifts. Specifically, each of an AB step shift (a shift from Step A to Step B), BC step shift (a shift from Step B to Step C), CD step shift (a shift from Step C to Step D), and DE step shift (a shift from Step D to Step E), the number of buzzer sounding times can be set within the range of 1 to 5, and the buzzer is sounded just sounding times set for each of the four step shifts. Also, as illustrated in FIG. 15, before performing a working menu, a preheating step is performed at a heating power level selected as one of the multiple heating power levels. The completion of the working time of menu working automatically extinguishes the burner, stops the rotation of the pan, and stops the rotation of the stirrer. Note that regarding the ignition of the burner, the control means 12 does not have an automatic ignition function, and therefore a user should operate the ignition switch to cause ignition at the start of working, or cause ignition after extinction in the middle of working. (5) Next, the menu setting method and the working method are specifically described. As illustrated in FIG. 15, for example, in the case of after the preheating action, as menu working, setting a working time of 30 seconds, heating power level of 3, pan rotating speed level of 2, and stirrer rotating speed level of 2 for Step A; then a buzzer alert (setting: two times); a working time of 10 seconds, heating power level of 5, pan rotating speed level of 3, and stirrer rotating speed level of 3 for Step B; then a buzzer alert nil (setting: 0); a working time of 10 seconds, heating power level of 0 (extinction), pan rotating speed level of 1, and stirrer rotating speed level of 1 for Step C; and then completion (pan rotation stop, stirrer rotation stop), menu setting operations are as follows: <1> A number (1 to 10) desired to be registered is selected with the ten key switches SW1 to SW01. In doing so, the selected number is displayed in the menu number display part 147. <2> By pressing down the setting switch 157, the setting mode is activated. In doing so, the working time display part 146 displays “A- --”, and the setting mode is brought into an activation state (Step A Setting contents changeable state). <3> The working contents for the first 30 seconds are set for Step A (a working time of 30 seconds, heating power level of 3, pan rotating speed level of 2, and stirring rotating speed level of 2 are set with the ten key switched SW1 to SW10). <4> In the case where the settings for Step A are completed, the decision switch 158 is pressed down to shift to the next step. In doing so, the working time display part 146 displays “AB -”, and the number of buzzer sounding times for the AB step shift is brought into a settable state. <5> The number of buzzer sounding times is set to 2 with the ten key switches SW5 and SW10 to shift to the next step with the decision switch 158. In doing so, the working time display part 146 displays “B- --”, and Step B is brought into a changeable state. <6> The working contents for the next 10 seconds are set for Step B (a working time of 10 seconds, heating power level of 5, pan rotating speed level of 3, and stirring rotating speed level of 3 are set with the ten key switched SW1 to SW10). <7> In the case where the settings for Step B are completed, the decision switch 158 is pressed down to shift to the next step. In doing so, the working time display part 146 displays “BB -”, and the number of buzzer sounding times for the BC step shift is brought into a settable state. <8> The number of buzzer sounding times is set to 0 with the ten key switches SW5 and SW10 to shift to the next step with the decision switch 158. In doing so, the working time display part 146 displays “C- --”, and Step C is brought into a changeable state. <9> The working contents for the next 10 seconds are set for Step C (a working time of 10 seconds, heating power level of 0, pan rotating speed level of 1, and stirring rotating speed level of 1 are set with the ten key switched SW1 to SW10). <10> In the case where the settings for Step C are completed, the decision switch 158 is pressed down to shift to the next step. In doing so, the working time display part 146 displays “CB --”, and the number of buzzer sounding times for the BC step shift is brought into a settable state. The number of buzzer sounding times is set to 0 with the ten key switches SW5 and SW10 to shift to the next step with the decision switch 158. In doing so, the working time display part 146 displays “D- --”, and Step D is brought into a changeable state. In this case, Step D, DE step shift, and Step E are unused, and therefore in the same operation manner as above, the working time and the number of buzzer sounding times are respectively set to 0 minutes 00 seconds, and 0 so as to make “D0 00”, “DE -0” and “E0 00” appear. After the completion of the settings of all of the small processes, pressing the setting switch 157 completes the setting mode to shift to a working screen (to complete the operations for the menu settings). By repeating the above-described operations for the menu numbers 1 to 10, up to 10 menus can be registered. Also, once settings are made, making the settings is not required for the next working. The number of registered menus may be 10 or more. Menu working is as follows. That is, a working menu is selected, and the burner is ignited with the ignition/extinction switch 151 to preheat the pan 3. After that, by pressing down the menu start switch 155, the menu working is started, and the completion of the working time automatically stops the working (reports the completion of the working end). According to the above-described embodiment, in the case of working the food stir-frying machine 1, it is only necessary that by swinging the operation lever 71 downward to make the operation lever 71 engage with the lower locking groove 75b, the stirring frame 55 is retained in a state of being swung downward with respect to the device frame 56 in order to make the stirrer 8 and the stirrer spatula 50 protrude toward the pan 3. At this time, the biasing means 104 biases the supporting member 49 toward the pan 3 side with respect to the stirring frame 55 to bring the stirrer 8 into contact with the inner surface of the pan 3, and also the biasing means 113 biases the swing member 53 toward the pan 3 side with respect to the stirring frame 55 to bring the stirring spatula 50 into contact with the inner surface of the pan 3. During working of the food stir-frying machine 1, driving of the pan driving motor 23 rotates the ring gear 25 through the drive gear 24 at a set rotating speed in the direction indicated by the arrow a, and along with this, the pan receiving body 27 and the pan 3 rotate at the set pan rotating speed in the direction indicated by the arrow a. Also, driving of the stirring motor 62 rotates the rotary shaft 48 in the direction indicated by the arrow b, and the stirrer 8 rotates a set stirrer rotating speed in the direction indicated by the arrow b. Further, the heating means 6 is ignited to produce set heating power. Accordingly, the heating power of the heating means 6 heats the pan 3; the pan 3 rotates in the a direction; and the stirrer 8 rotates in the b direction; whereby food materials in the pan 3 are scooped, turned over, and shoved, i.e., stirred by the stirring spatula 50 and the stirrer 8, and stir-fried by the heating. Meanwhile, in the present embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 14, the entire process of a recipe is divided into the multiple small processes (Step A, Step B, Step C, Step D, and Step E); for each of the small processes, the length of the working time, level of the heating power, level of a pan operating speed, and level of the stirrer rotating speed are configured to be settable in multiple stages; the working time, heating power, pan rotating speed, and stirrer rotating speed are set for each of the small processes to prepare a working menu having conditions optimum for cooking; and then, the multiple small processes can be sequentially performed to automatically perform the working menu. In addition, since a working menu is prepared and registered for each of multiple recipes, and then one of the registered multiple working menus is selected and performed, or the control means 12 has the registration part 139 adapted to prepare and register a working menu for each of multiple recipe, and the performing part 140 adapted to perform a working menu selected from the registration part 139, for each of the multiple recipes, a working menu can be minutely prepared so as to have optimum cooking conditions, and stocked, and any of the working menus can be selected and repeatedly performed, which is very convenience. Still further, since for each of step shifts from a current small step to a next small step, the number of buzzer sounding times is set, and in the case of sequentially performing the multiple small processes to perform a working menu, at the time of each of the step shifts, the buzzer is sounded just set sounding times, or the control means 12 has the step shift part 141 adapted to sounds the buzzer at the time of a small process shift, a user of the food stir-frying machine 1 can know a shift from a current small step to a next small step in advance in the middle of performing the working menu, and therefore more smoothly do cooking. Also, since before performing a working menu, the preheating step for which one of the multiple heating power levels is selected and set is performed, the pan 3 can be moderately heated by the preheating step before performing the working menu, and cooking according to the working menu can be made uniform and better. Further, in the present embodiment, since between the stirring frame 55 and the supporting member 49, the biasing means 104 adapted to bias the supporting member 49 toward the pan 3 side so as to bring the stirrer 8 into contact with the inner surface of the pan 3 is provided, the stirrer 8 can be surely and smoothly rotated while being brought into elastic contact with the inner surface of the pan 3, and the durability of the stirrer 8 can be increased. In addition, since the stirrer 8 includes the spiral rod 130 that slidingly contacts with the inner surface of the pan 3, and the push-out surface 130a of the spiral rod 130, which is adapted to push out food materials toward the pan bottom 39a side, is arranged perpendicular to the inner surface of the pan 3 on the outer side of the bottom surface 39a, the rotation of the pan 3 and the rotation of the stirrer 8 make it possible for the push-out surface 130a of the stirrer 8 to surely and efficiently push out food materials toward the pan bottom 39a side, and therefore the stirrer 8 can more favorably cur and stir the food materials. Still further, since the stirring blades 133 adapted to lift food materials are protruded at intervals in the longer direction on the spiral rod 130 slidingly contacting with the inner surface of the pan 3, the rotation of the pan 3 and the rotation of the stirrer 8 causes the multiple stirring blades 133 to lift food materials in the pan 3, and consequently the stirrer 8 can greatly stir food materials. Also, since in each of the stirring blades 133, the attachment base part 134 protruding from the spiral rod 130 toward the pan bottom 39a is provided with the tilted blade piece 135, and the tilted blade piece 135 protrudes in the direction away from the inner surface of the pan 3, the rotation of the pan 3 and the rotation of the stirrer 8 makes it possible to efficiently lift food materials to more smoothly stir the food materials without accumulating the food materials. Further, since the spiral of the stirrer 9 is set to less than 360 degrees so as to make the number of contact points with the pan 3 equal to one, the stirrer 8 can be surely and stably brought into contact with the inner surface of the pan 3 at the one point, and therefore surely cut food materials such as egg adhering to the pan 3 away from the pan 3. In addition, since the fore end of the rotary shaft 48 is provided with the holder 116 into which the base part of the stirrer 8 is inserted and fitted, and the holder 116 has: the holder body 117 formed with the locking groove 121 that is adapted to lock the engaging pin 120 provided at the base part of the stirrer 8 by turning the engaging pin 120 after insertion of the engaging pin 120 in the shaft direction; and the holder cover 118 that is fitted to the outside of the holder body 117 slidably in the shaft direction to block the engaging pin 120 from turning, the base part of the stirrer 8 can be easily and surely attached to the fore end of the rotary shaft 48, and the stirrer 8 can be surely prevented from rotating relatively to the rotary shaft 48, so that rotational force from the stirring motor 62 can be surely transmitted to the stirrer 8 through the rotary shaft 48 to smoothly rotate the stirrer 8. Still further, in the present embodiment, since in the pan driving device 5, the pan receiving body 27 adapted to receive the pan 3 is placed on the ring gear 25; the ring gear 25 surrounds the upper part of the heating means 6 and is rotatably supported by the upper part of the machine base 2; and the pan driving motor 23 adapted to drive the ring gear 25 is arranged below the upper wall 2a of the machine base 2, the pan driving device 5 and the heating means 6 can be vertically compactly arranged, and consequently the machine base 2 of the food stir-frying machine 1 can be vertically compactly configured. Also, at the same time, the pan driving motor 23 can be arranged laterally outward from the ring gear 25 and distant from the heating means 6, and therefore a thermal effect on the pan driving motor 23 can be reduced. Further, since the opening 18 is provided in the upper wall 2a of the machine base 2; the ring gear 25 is horizontally arranged on the lower side of the opening 18 through the supporting rollers 29 arranged on the lower surface of the upper wall 2a; and the pan driving motor 23 having the drive gear 24 that gears with the ring gear 25 is arranged on the lower surface of the upper wall 2a, which is distant from the opening 18, the ring gear 25 can be formed of one plate as a thin and simple structure, and the ring gear 25, the drive gear 24 gearing with the ring gear 25, and the pan driving motor 23 having the drive gear 24 can be arranged in a concentrated manner on the lower surface side of the upper wall 2a of the machine base 2, so that from such a perspective as well, the vertical width of the machine base 2 can be made as small as possible to make the machine base 2 more compact. In addition, since the ring gear 25 and the heating means 6, and the pan driving motor 23 and the drive gear 24 are separately arranged in the front storage room 15 and back storage room 16 of the machine base 2, respectively, and between the heating means 6 side and the pan driving motor 23 side, the partitioning wall 14 is provided for partitioning, the pan driving motor 23 and the drive gear 24 can be prevented from being adversely affected by heat of the heating means 6. Also, on the upper surface of the ring gear 25, the locking parts 36 are provided; in the lower surface of the pan receiving body 27, the engaging parts 37 that engage with the locking parts 36 are provided in an engageable/disengageable manner; and the engagement between the locking parts 36 and the engaging parts 37 makes it possible for the pan receiving body 27 to rotate integrally with the ring gear 25 and rotate relatively to the ring gear 25 due to excessive resistance, in the case where some object is caught by any of the handles 42 of the pan 3 to generate excessive resistance against the rotation of the pan 3, the engagement between the locking parts 36 and the engaging parts 37 is disengaged, and thereby the rotation of the pan receiving body 27 can be reduced in speed with respect to the rotation of the ring gear 25. Further, since below the heating means 6 in the machine base 2, the tray 44 that can store fallen objects and is drawable is provided, fallen objects such as food materials falling from between the heating means 6 and the ring gear 25 can be received by the tray 44, and therefore a surrounding area of the food stir-frying machine 1 can be prevented from being made dirty by fallen food materials and the like. In addition, the tray 44 can be drawn from the machine base 2 to easily take out the fallen objects. Note that in the above-described embodiment, the spiral rod 130 of the stirrer 8 is formed so as to have a quadrangular cross-section; however, instead, the cross section of the spiral rod 130 may be formed in a triangular shape, a pentagonal shape, or another shape. Also, in the above-described embodiment, the working time, heating power, pan rotating speed, and stirrer rotating speed are all settable in multiple stages; however, instead, for each of the small processes, two or three of the length of the working time, level of the heating power, level of the pan rotating speed, and level of the stirrer rotating speed may be adapted to be settable in multiple stated. For example, for each of the small processes, the length of the working time, and the level of the heating power may be settable in multiple stages, and the pan rotating speed and the stirrer rotating speed may be fixed at constant rotating speeds, respectively, or alternatively, the level of the pan rotating speed and the level of the stirrer rotating speed may be settable in multiple stages, and the working time and the heating power may be kept constant. Further, in the above-described embodiment, the heating means 6 is configured to include the gas burner; however, instead, the heating means 6 may be configured to include an electric stove, an IH heater, or another heating device of which heating power can be regulated to large or small power.
