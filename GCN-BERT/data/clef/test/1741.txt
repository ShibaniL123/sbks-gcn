Step 2: 2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 3-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)propanoate
To a stirring solution of the acid from step 1 (50 mg, 0.2 mmol) in DCM (3 mL), DCC (51.3 mg, 0.2 mmol) was added slowly, then DMAP (5 mg, 0.04 mmol) and finally N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (49.2 mg, 0.2 mmol), synthesized as reported in Example 1. The reaction was left stirring overnight. The crude suspension was filtered to remove the DCU precipitate and then concentrated at 40 Â°C. The product was purified by column chromatography (50% and then 75% EtOAc in hexane). 74.4 mg of the final product were obtained (86%).
