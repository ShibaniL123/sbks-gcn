This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/734,003, filed Dec. 6, 2012, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application. FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates to one or more bone plate template systems having one or more removable bone plate templates, one or more removable segments and one or more methods for using the bone plate template systems. The present bone plate template systems and methods may be used to identify one or more bone plates having a correct, suitable or appropriate sizes, shapes and/or lengths to be utilized in a bone plate fixation or implant procedure. The bone plate template systems may have one or more removable bone plate templates and/or one or more removable segments that may be removed or separated from the bone plate template systems to determine, indicate and/or identify a correct, suitable or appropriate size, shape and/or length for a bone plate to be affixed to a damaged bone of a patient or implanted into the patient during a bone fixation or implant procedure. One of the sides of the bone plate template systems, the removable bone plate templates and/or the removable segments may have or display indicia which may be used to determine or identify the correct, suitable and/or appropriate bone plate to be utilized during the bone plate fixation or implant procedure. Each bone plate template system and corresponding bone plate implants may be individually sterilized and individually packaged such that each bone plate template system and bone plate implants are immediately ready for use in the procedure after unpackaging from their individual sterile-packaging. Bone plates are traditionally delivered to the operating room in various shapes and sizes so that the surgeon can choose the suitable or appropriate bone plate to be used to complete the surgical procedure. The surgeon is traditionally required to hold many different bone plates, having different sizes, shapes and/or lengths, near an operating sight of the patient to determine or identify which one of the many different bone plates is correctly shaped and/or sized for repairing the damaged bone of the patient based on the one or more dimensions of the operating sight and/or the damaged bone of the patient. As a result, the many different bone plates that were handled by the surgeon, but not used by the surgeon during the procedure, need to be, and are required to be, subsequently sterilized for future use or discarded all together. Either subsequently sterilizing the unused, but handled, different bone plates or discarding the unused, but handled, different bone plates is costly, time consuming and/or labour intensive, and may even result in subsequent damage to the unused, but handled, bone plates or insufficient sterilization of the unused, but handled, bone plates. The present bone plate template systems and methods provide one or more removable bone plate templates connected to a main body which may be easily removed, without the use of a tool, in the operating room or may be removed or separated, by hand, during the procedure. In embodiments, one or more of the removable bone plate templates may have one or more removable segments which may be easily removed, without the use of a tool, in the operating room or may be removed, by hand, during the procedure. Each bone plate template system is delivered to the operating room in individual sterile-packaging within a kit container which may have one or more individually sterile-packaged sterile containers. The one or more individually sterile-packaged containers may each contain a sterile bone plate and/or a set of sterile screws sized for use with the bone plate. Some of the individually packaged sterile containers may contain other components necessary for completing the bone plate fixation or implant procedure. In an embodiment, one of the bone plate template systems and/or removable bone plate templates may have a size, shape and/or length that corresponds to a size, shape and/or length of a largest and/or longest bone plate that is included in the kit container. During the procedure, a surgeon may hold one or more bone plate template systems and/or removable bone plate template up to, near or adjacent to the operating site on the patient to determine or identify the correct, suitable or appropriate size, shape and/or length of the bone plate that is needed to complete the procedure. Then, unless the largest bone plate in the kit container is the correct size, shape and/or length necessary for completing the procedure based on the operating site, the surgeon may tear off or physically remove or separate one or more of the removable segments from the bone plate template system and/or removable bone plate template in order to determine and/or identify the suitable bone plate implant having the suitable size, shape and/or length to be utilized during the procedure based on the one or more dimensions of the operating site and/or damaged bone of the patient. The removable segments, including the removable segments separated from the bone plate template system, may be stamped or marked with and/or display indicia, such as, for example, letters, numbers, symbols, designs, graphics and/or combinations thereof. As a result, the indicia on the removable segments separated from the bone plate template system may be used, inspected or observed to determine and/or identify the suitable bone plate, having the suitable size, shape and/or length, for completing the procedure. Subsequently, the suitable bone plate, identified or determined by the indicia of the removable segments separated and/or removed from the bone plate template system, may then be selected from the kit container, unpackaged from its individual sterile-packaging, and used to complete the bone plate fixation and/or implant procedure. As a result, only the suitable bone plate, that is needed to complete the procedure, is unpackaged and/or handled in the operating room prior to affixation to the bone of the patient or implantation into the patient. Other differently shaped and/or sized bone plates, included in the kit container, that are not suitable for completing the procedure remain sterile in their individual sterile-packaging within the kit container for subsequent use in a different subsequent procedure. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE In embodiments, a bone plate template may identify a suitable bone plate implant.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE The present bone plate template systems and methods may have one or more removable bone plate templates and/or removable segments which may easily be removed, without the use of a tool, to determine, identify and/or select a correct, suitable and/or appropriate bone plate (hereinafter “suitable bone plate”) from a plurality of differently sized and/or shaped bone plates (hereinafter “plurality of bone plates”) for completing a surgical procedure, a bone plate fixation, bone plating or implantation procedure (hereinafter “the procedure”). After being separated from the bone plate template system, the separated bone plate templates and/or separated segments themselves, or indicia displayed thereon, may be utilized, inspected or observed to determine, identify and/or select the suitable bone plate from the plurality of bone plates. The suitable bone plate may be subsequently used for fixation to or implantation into a patient during the procedure. Alternatively, the bone plate template, whereby the separated segments may have been removed therefrom, may be utilized, inspected or observed to determine, identify and/or select the suitable bone plate from the plurality of bone plates. In embodiments, the bone plate template system, the removable bone plate templates and/or each bone plate of the plurality of bone plates are individually sterilized and individually packaged such that, during the surgical procedure, only the bone plate template system, the removable bone plate templates and/or the suitable bone plate are opened or unpackaged and the remaining unused components and/or the unused bone plates of the plurality of bone plates remain in their individual sterile-packaging for use during subsequent procedures. The bone plate template systems and/or the removable bone plate templates are single-use disposable medical components, such that, after completion of the procedure, the bone plate template systems and/or the removable bone plate templates along with any separated removable segments may be disposed without requiring any further attention from the surgical staff and/or medical providers. Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like parts, a first bone plate template 10 (hereinafter “template 10”), and a second bone plate template 30 (hereinafter “template 30”) are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, respectively. A bone plate template system 100 (hereinafter “system 100”) having a plurality of removable bone plate templates 104a-104z (hereinafter “templates 104a-104z”) is shown in FIG. 5. Each of the template 10, the template 30 and/or the templates 104a-104z (collectively known hereinafter as “templates 10, 30, 104a-104z”) may have a general shape and/or an outer perimeter that may be the same as, similar to or corresponds to a general shape and/or an outer perimeter of at least one corresponding bone plate implant that is provided in a surgical procedure kit container (not shown in the drawings). Further, each of the templates 10, 30, 104a-104z may have a length that is the same as, similar to or corresponds to a length of at least one corresponding bone plate provided in the kit container. For example, template 30 (as shown in FIG. 2) has a general shape, outer perimeter, width and/or length that is the same as, similar to or corresponds to a general shape, outer perimeter, width and/or length of a corresponding bone plate implant, such as, for example, bone plate implant 40 (hereinafter “plate 40”) as shown in FIG. 4. The template 10 may have a general shape, outer perimeter, width and/or length that may be the same as, similar to or corresponding to a general shape, outer perimeter, width and/or length of at least one corresponding bone plate implant (not shown in the drawings). Each of the templates 104a-104z may have a general shape, outer perimeter, width and/or length that may be the same as, similar to or corresponding to a general shape, outer perimeter, width and/or length of at least one corresponding bone plate implant (not shown in the drawings). In embodiments, only portions of the templates 10, 30, 104a-104z have general shapes, outer perimeters, widths and/or lengths that may be the same as, similar to or corresponding to general shapes, outer perimeters, widths and/or lengths of at least portion of at least one corresponding bone plate implant (not shown in the drawings). In an embodiment, the templates 10, 30, 104a-104z may have a general shape and/or an outer perimeter that corresponds to or substantially corresponds to a general shape and/or an outer perimeter of one or more corresponding bone plate implants (hereinafter “corresponding plates”) which may be provided in a kit container along with the templates 10, 30, 104a-104z, respectively. For example, the kit container, including the template 30, the plate 40 and corresponding plates that have corresponding or similar general shapes or outer perimeters with respect to the system 30 and the plate 40, may be utilized by a surgeon or medical provider to complete at least one procedure. The corresponding plates, included in the kit container, may have corresponding general shapes and/or outer perimeters that are the same as, similar to or correspond to the general shapes and/or outer perimeters of the template 30 and plate 40; however, each of the corresponding plates of the kit container may have different overall lengths which may be less than or shorter than overall lengths of the template 30 and/or the plate 40. In embodiments, each of the corresponding plates of the kit container may have at least one different dimension with respect to each other, the template 30 and/or the plate 40. For example each corresponding plate of the kit container may have different heights, different widths, different thicknesses and/or different lengths when compared to heights, widths, thicknesses and/or lengths of other corresponding plates, the template 30 and/or the plate 40 provided in the kit container. In embodiments, the kit container comprises the corresponding plates and the plate 40 whereby each corresponding plate has a different length when compared to the each other and a shorter length than the overall length of the plate 40. As a result of these different lengths, the surgeon or medical provider must determine, identify and select a suitable bone plate, from the plate 40 and the corresponding plates of the kit container, having a correct, suitable or appropriate length (hereinafter “suitable length”) for affixing to a damaged bone or for implantation into the patient. The suitable length of the suitable bone plate is determined or identified based on a length associated the operating site or the damaged bone of the patient. The suitable length for the suitable bone plate may be determined by visual inspection of the operating site or the damaged bone of the patient or direct comparison of the system 30 and the operating site and/or damaged bone of the patient. In embodiments, the templates 10, 30, 104a-104z have at least one dimension, such as, for example, a height, a width, a thickness and/or a length that is the same as, similar to, substantially similar to or corresponding to at least one dimension of a largest bone plate implant of the corresponding plates included in the kit container. For example, template 30 may have an overall length that is the same as, similar to or corresponding to an overall length of the longest bone plate implant (hereinafter “longest plate”), such as, for example, plate 40. The other bone plate implants of the corresponding plates provided in the kit container have smaller or shorter overall lengths than the overall lengths of the system 30 and the longest plate (i.e., plate 40). Based on the shape and/or length associated with the operating site and/or the damaged bone of the patient, the suitable bone plate having the suitable shape and/or length may be the longest bone plate provided in the kit container (i.e., plate 40) or may be one of the corresponding plates having a shorter length than the longest bone plate implant of the kit container. In order to determine the suitable shape and/or length and the suitable bone plate, the surgeon or medical provider may visually inspect the operating site or the damaged bone and utilize one of the templates 10, 30, 104a-104z to determine or identify the shape and/or length associated with the operating site and/or the damaged bone. After the suitable shape and/or length for the suitable bone plate is determined or identified based on the shape and/or length associated with the operating site and/or the damaged bone, at least a portion of one of the systems 10, 30 may be removed or separated to determine and/or select the suitable bone plate from the plate 40 and the corresponding plates included in the kit container. After the suitable bone plate is determined and/or selected from the kit container, the individually sterile-packaging housing, storing or protecting the suitable bone plate is opened or unpackaged, and the unpackaged suitable bone plate is subsequently affixed to or implanted into the patient during the procedure. In embodiments, the plate 40 and corresponding plates included in the kit container may be, for example, an anatomic plate, a reconstruction plate or an osteosynthesis plate. In an embodiment, the plate 40 and corresponding plates may be, for example, a veterinary orthopedic implant.

One method for using the template 10 to determine, identify and select the suitable plate for affixing to a damaged bone of a patient or for implanting into the patient at the operating site comprising delivering the kit container to the surgeon, surgical staff or medical provider. The delivered kit container may include the template 10, a longest bone plant implant and corresponding bone plate implants, each have lengths that are different from one another and shorter than the length of the longest bone plate implant included in the kit container. Each component of the kit container is wrapped or packaged in individual sterile-packaging and the template 10 has a shape that corresponds to at least a portion of the longest bone plate and corresponding bone implants. Moreover, the template 10 has an overall length that corresponds to the overall length of the longest bone plate implant included in the kit container. The template 10 is unpackaged from the individual sterile-packaging and the user of the template 10 holds or positions the template 10 next to, near and/or adjacent to the operating site or the damaged bone on the patient. The user visually compares the length of the operating site or the damaged bone to the length of the template 10 to determine or identify the suitable length for the suitable plate that is needed to successfully complete the surgical procedure. If the suitable length, based on the length of the operating site and/or the damaged bone, corresponds to the overall length of the longest bone plate implant of the kit container, then the longest bone plate implant of the kit container is determined and/or identified to be the suitable plate used to complete the surgical procedure. Then, the longest bone plate implant is unpackaged from its individual sterile-packaging and utilized by the surgeon to complete the surgical procedure, and the template 10 is disposed of after the suitable plate is determined. However, if the suitable length, based on the visual inspection or comparison of the length of the operating site and/or the damaged bone, is shorter than overall length of the longest bone plate implant provide in the kit container, then the user may utilize the system 10 to determine the suitable length which is then utilized to identify and select the suitable plate from the corresponding plates provided in the kit container. The user may determine, via visual comparison and/or inspection, that the length of the operating site and/or the damaged bone is the same as, equal to or similar to a portion of length of the template 10. It may be determined by the user that the length of the operating site and/or the damaged bone may correspond to a remaining length of the template 10 after one or more removable segments 24a-24z may be removed from the template 10 or removed from the base section 20 and the removable section 22 of the template 10. The user may, by hand and without use of a tool, brake, remove or separate the one or more removable segments 24a-24z from the template 10 at one of the connecting sections 26a-26z such that the template 10 has a remaining length that corresponds to the length of the operating site and/or the damaged bone of the patient. As a result, the remaining length of the template 10 corresponds to the suitable length for the suitable plate to successfully complete the surgical procedure. Each of the body section 20 and the removable segments 24a-24z of template 10 and each of the removable segments 24a-24z of template 30 display indicia that is indicative of the longest and corresponding bone plate implants provided in the kit container. For example, the indicia displayed on the body section 20 of the template 10 is indicative of the shortest bone plate implant provided in the kit container, and the indicia displayed on the removable segment 24z is indicative of the longest bone plate implant provided in the kit container. The indicia displayed on each of the removable segments 24a-24y located between the body section 20 and the removable segment 24z is indicative of a corresponding bone plate implant of the kit container having a length greater than the shortest bone plate implant and less than the longest bone plate implant, respectively, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3. Indicia displayed on the templates 10, 30 may be, for example, letters, numbers, symbols, designs, graphics and/or combinations thereof. The indicia may be marked onto a top side and/or a bottom side of the templates 10, 30 by a known marking technique. For example, the indicia may be stamped, printed, engraved, cut or carved into one or more of the top and bottom sides of the templates 10, 30. In a preferred embodiment, the indicia is laser-marked into the top surface of the templates 10, 30 by known laser-marking techniques. It should be understood that the present disclosure is not limited to a specific embodiment of the indicia and/or the known marking technique used to mark the indicia onto the templates 10, 30. Because the remaining length of the template 10 corresponds to the length of the operating site and/or the damaged bone of the patient, the removable segment 24x that was separated from the template 10 and that is located opposite to the second end 14 of the template 10 also corresponds to the length of the operating site and/or damaged bone. Moreover, the indicia displayed on the removable segment 24x is indicative of the suitable plate having the suitable length that is the same as, similar to or corresponding to the length of the operating site and/or the damaged bone of the patient. A user, surgical staff member or medical provide may visually inspect the indicia displayed on the removable segment 24x, located opposite to the second end 14 of the template 10, which is indicative of the suitable plate for completing the surgical procedure and is indicative of the corresponding bone plate implant of the kit container that has a length that corresponds to the suitable length and the length of the operating site and/or the damaged bone of the patient. After the corresponding bone plate implant that is determined to be the suitable plate is identified from the corresponding plates provided in the kit container, the suitable plate is selected and removed from the kit container to be used to complete the surgical procedure. The suitable plate may then be unpackaged from the individual sterile-packaging and utilized by the surgeon to complete the surgical procedure, and the template 10 along with the separated removable sections 24x-24z may be disposed of without any further attention from the surgical staff or medical provider. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, the indicia displayed on the base plate 20 of the template 10 may include letters and numbers, such as, for example, “FRP 432”, and the indicia displayed on removable segments 24a-24z may include letters and increasing numbers, such as, for example, “FRP 433” to “FRP 439”, respectively. The user physically, without use of a tool, removes or separates the removable segments 24x-24z (collectively known hereinafter as “separated portion 32”) from the template 10 so that the remaining length of a remaining portion 34 of the template 10 has a length that is the same as, similar to or corresponding to the length of the operating site and/or the damaged bone and the suitable length for the suitable plate to complete the surgical procedure as shown in FIG. 3. The user, a surgical staff member or medical reads the indicia displayed on the removable segment 24x that is located opposite to the second end 12 of the separated portion 32. In this example, the indicia “FRP 437” displayed on the removable segment 24x is read and used to determine and identify which bone plate implant provided in the kit container is the suitable plate having the suitable length for completing the surgical procedure. Each individual sterile-packaging, containing one bone plate implant, displays indicia that correspond to or match the indicia displayed on one of the base portion 20 or one of the removable segments 24a-24z of the template 10. After the individual sterile-packaging that displays the indicia “FRP 437” is identified and removed from the kit container, the suitable bone plate implant is removed from its sterile-packaging and utilized by the surgeon to complete the surgical procedure, and the separated portion 32 and the remaining portion 34 are readily disposed of without further attention by the surgical staff or medical provider. Similar to the indicia displayed on the template 10 and as shown in FIG. 2, the indicia displayed on each of the removable segments 24a-24z of the template 30 may be indicative of one bone plate implant having a different length that is provided in a kit container for the template 30. The indicia displayed on the template 30 may include, for example, sets of letters, such as “FPR” and sets of different numbers, such as, “704,” “705,” “706,” “707,” “708,” “709,” 710, “712,” “714,” and “716”.
