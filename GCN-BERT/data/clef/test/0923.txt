The present invention relates to a knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium expressing a 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-coenzyme A mutase, a method for the production of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid, comprising contacting in an aqueous medium the knallgas bacterium or acetogenic with a gas mixture comprising hydrogen and carbon dioxide and the use of the knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium for the production of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid. Growing global population and worldwide raising life standards inevitably enforce the conflict of satisfying the people's demands for goods and services on one and for sustainable development and considerate treatment of nature and earth's resources on the other hand. It is not only that fossil carbon sources will become limited in the future, but also the accessibility of nowadays treated and prospected sites will increasingly be hindered. Known accidents drastically demonstrate this danger such as the recent oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. White biotechnology offers an elegant way to provide alternatives not only due to the application of microorganisms or components of cells but also due to the application of the broad spectrum of new generation renewable substrates. For ages the chemical industry has produced, for instance alcohols and organic adds, in bulk dimensions in biotechnological processes mainly to be used as chemicals, but above all as energy carriers. Of those, bio-ethanol is a recent integrant of modern fuels for motor vehicles and bio-butanol is contemplated. Based on the knowledge of bulk scale energy carrier production recent intentions envision the extension of platform chemicals for wider application. Special attempts are directed towards the synthesis of chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol, succinate, gluconic add or citric acid. Likewise, 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (2-HIB) fits well into this scheme as it is rising as platform chemical. In particular since 2-HIB can be used as precursor for methacrylic add, a monomeric compound required for the synthesis of such prominent products like Plexiglas® and as an important ingredient for coating materials, paint and glues. Generally, traditional biotechnological processes, such as those for bio-ethanol production, are based on carbon sources of the so-called first generation, i.e. carbohydrates derived directly from plants like sugars or starch. It turns out, however, that such resources are limited and that it seems adequate to channel them into the production of foodstuffs rather than chemicals. The state of the art teaches biotechnological routes towards the production of 2-HIB. For example, PCT/EP2009/055089 teaches cell which has been genetically modified so as to be capable of producing more 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid or more polyhydroxyalkanoates containing 2-hydroxyisobutyric add monomer units than its wild type, characterized in that 2-hydroxyisobutyric add or polyhydroxyalkanoates containing 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid monomer units are produced via acetoacetyl-coenzyme A as intermediate and 3-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme A as precursor. However, the process for the production of 2-HIB contemplates the use of carbohydrate-containing carbohydrates or derivates thereof, for examples sodium gluconate, which is to be avoided from an environmental point of view. Furthermore, a significant proportion of any carbon dioxide consumed in the production of said carbohydrates is not converted to the sought-after product 2-HIB, but lost in various metabolic routes on the way towards 2-HIB. Therefore, the problem underlying the present invention is to devise a process for producing 2-HIB which may be carried out in the absence of energy-rich organic compounds. Moreover, the problem underlying the present invention is to devise a biotechnological route towards the production of 2-HIB. Moreover, the problem underlying the present invention is to devise a biotechnological method for the production of 2-HIB that is superior compared to state of the art processes in that more carbon atoms in the 2-HIB obtained are derived from carbon dioxide molecules, i.e. the proportion of carbon atoms derived from carbon dioxide rather than from any other organic molecules, for example alcohols or carbohydrates, is higher.

The teachings of the present invention may not only carried out using biological macromolecules having the exact amino acid or nucleic acid sequences referred to in this application explicitly, for example by name or accession number, or implicitly, but also using variants of such sequences. In a preferred embodiment, the term “variant”, as used herein, comprises amino acid or nucleic acid sequences, respectively, that are 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99% identical to the reference amino acid or nucleic acid sequence, wherein preferably amino acids other than those essential for the function, for example the catalytic activity of a protein, or the fold or structure of a molecule are deleted, substituted or replaced by insertions or essential amino acids are replaced in a conservative manner. The state of the art comprises algorithms that may be used to align two given nucleic add or amino acid sequences and to calculate the degree of Identity, see Arthur Lesk (2008), Introduction to bioinformatics, 3rd edition, Thompson et al., Nucleic Acids Research 22, 4637-4680, 1994, and Katoh et al., Genome Information, 16(1), 22-33, 2005. The term “variant” is used synonymously and interchangeably with the term “homologue”. Such variants may be prepared by introducing deletions, insertions or substitutions in amino acid or nucleic acid sequences as well as fusions comprising such macromolecules or variants thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the term “variant”, with regard to amino acid sequence, comprises, preferably in addition to the above sequence identity, amino acid sequences that comprise one or more conservative amino acid changes with respect to the respective reference or wild type sequence or comprises nucleic acid sequences encoding amino acid sequences that comprise one or more conservative amino acid changes. In a preferred embodiment, the term variant of an amino acid sequence or nucleic acid sequence comprises, preferably in addition to the above degree of sequence identity, any active portion and/or fragment of the amino acid sequence or nucleic acid sequence, respectively, or any nucleic acid sequence encoding an active portion and/or fragment of an amino acid sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the term “active portion”, as used herein, refers to an amino add sequence or a nucleic acid sequence, which is less than the full length amino acid sequence or codes for less than the full length amino acid sequence, respectively, wherein the amino acid sequence or the amino add sequence encoded, respectively retains at least some of its essential biological activity. For example an active portion and/or fragment of a protease is capable of hydrolysing peptide bonds in polypeptides. In a preferred embodiment, the term “retains at least some of its essential biological activity”, as used herein, means that the amino acid sequence in question has a biological activity exceeding and distinct from the background activity and the kinetic parameters characterising said activity, more specifically kcat and KM, are preferably within 3, more preferably 2, most preferably one order of magnitude of the values displayed by the reference molecule with respect to a specific substrate. In a preferred embodiment, the term “variant” of a nucleic acid comprises nucleic adds the complementary strand of which hybridises, preferably under stringent conditions, to the reference or wild type nucleic acid. Stringency of hybridisation reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skilled in the art, and in generally is an empirical calculation dependent on probe length, washing temperature and salt concentration. In general longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridisation generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to reanneal to complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridisable sequence, the higher the relative temperature which may be used. As a result it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent, while lower temperature less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridisation reactions, see F. M. Ausubel (1995), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Moreover, the person skilled take in the art may follow the instructions given in the manual “The DIG System Users Guide for Filter Hybridization”, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany, 1993 and in Liebi et al. (International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology 41: 255-260 (1991) on how to identify DNA sequences by means of hybridisation. In a preferred embodiment, stringent conditions are applied for any hybridisation, i.e. hybridisation occurs only if the probe is 70% or more identical to the target sequence. Probes having a lower degree of identity with respect to the target sequence may hybridise, but such hybrids are unstable and will be removed in a washing step under stringent conditions, for example lowering the concentration of salt to 2×SSC or, optionally and subsequently, to 0.5×SSC, while the temperature is, in order of increasing preference, approximately 50° C.-68° C., approximately 52° C.-68° C., approximately 54° C.-68° C., approximately 56° C.-68° C., approximately 58° C.-68° C., approximately 60° C.-68° C., approximately 62° C.-68° C., approximately 64° C.-68° C., approximately 66° C.-68° C. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the temperature is approximately 64° C.-68° C. or approximately 66° C.-68° C. It is possible to adjust the concentration of salt to 0.2×SSC or even 0.1×SSC.

In a preferred embodiment, the term “homologue” of a nucleic acid sequence, as used herein, refers to any nucleic acid sequence that encodes the same amino acid sequence as the reference nucleic acid sequence, in line with the degeneracy of the genetic code. In a preferred embodiment, the activities of 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-coenzyme A mutase, MeaB proteins, fusion proteins comprising MeaB or variants thereof may be increased relative the wild type cell from which they originate. Techniques that may be used to genetically modify bacterial cells are described in the prior art, for example in Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual (1989) Cold Spring. Harbor Laboratory Press), as are methods for increasing the activity of an enzyme in a bacterial cell, for example by increasing expression of the gene encoding the enzyme having the activity of Interest by way of chromosomal gene amplification (WO 03/014330 and WO 03/040373). Additional techniques that may be used to delete a gene encoding an enzyme or reduce the activity of such an enzyme in a microorganism include the exposition of cells to radioactivity followed by accumulation or screening of the resulting mutants, site-directed introduction of point mutations or knock out of a chromosomally integrated gene encoding for an active enzyme.

Such a bacterium may be used to carry out the inventive method. Accordingly, the inventive method may comprise an additional step b) alkylating, preferably methylating any 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid or 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-coenzyme A produced in step a).

In a preferred embodiment, the carbon dioxide partial pressure is 0.03 to 100 bar, more preferably 0.05 to 1 bar, most preferably 0.05 to 0.3 bar. In a preferred embodiment, the oxygen partial pressure is 0.03 to 10 bar, more preferably 0.04 to 1 bar, most preferably 0.04 to 0.5 bar. In a preferred embodiment, the total combined pressure is 1 to 200 bar, preferably 1 to 10 bar, most preferably 1 to 5 bar. In a preferred embodiment, the knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium has a reduced fatty acid degradation capacity. In a preferred embodiment, the term “having a reduced fatty add degradation capacity”, as used in herein, means that the respective microorganism degrades fatty acids, preferably those taken up from the environment, at a lower rate than a comparable microorganism having normal fatty acid degradation capacity would. In a preferred embodiment, the fatty acid degradation of such a microorganism is lower on account of deletion, inhibition or Inactivation of at least one gene encoding an enzyme involved in the β-oxidation pathway. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least one enzyme involved in the β-oxidation pathway has lost, in order of increasing preference, 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 75, 90 or 99% activity relative to the activity of the same enzyme under comparable conditions in the respective wild type microorganism. The person skilled in the art is familiar with various techniques that may be used to delete a gene encoding an enzyme or reduce the activity of such an enzyme in a microorganism, for example by exposition of cells to radioactivity followed by accumulation or screening of the resulting mutants, site-directed introduction of point mutations or knock out of a chromosomally integrated gene encoding for an active enzyme, as described in Sambrook/Fritsch/Maniatis (1989). In addition, the transcriptional repressor FadR may be over expressed to the effect that expression of enzymes involved in the β-oxidation pathway is repressed (Y Fujita, H Matsuoka, and K Hirooka (2007) Mol. Microbiology 66(4), 829-839). In a preferred embodiment, the term “deletion of a gene”, as used herein, means that the nucleic add sequence encoding said gene is modified such that the expression of active polypeptide encoded by said gene is reduced. For example, the gene may be deleted by removing in-frame a part of the sequence comprising the sequence encoding for the catalytic active centre of the polypeptide. Alternatively, the ribosome binding site may be altered such that the ribosomes no longer translate the corresponding RNA. Moreover, the person skilled in the art is able to routinely measure the activity of enzymes expressed by living cells using standard essays as described in enzymology text books, for example A Cornish-Bowden (1995), Fundamentals of Enzym Kinetics, Portland Press Limited, 1995. The state of the art discloses various tests designed specifically for determining the activity of enzymes involved in the β-oxidation pathway, for example K Kameda & W D Nunn (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5702-5707, H Marrakchi, W E DeWolf, C Quinn, J West, B J Polizzi, C Y So et al. (2003) Biochem. J. 370, 1055-1062, S Lobo, G Florova, and K A Reynolds (2001) Biochemistry 40 (39), 11955-64, X Yu, T Liu, F Zhu, and C Khosla (2011) PNAS, published online). According to the Inventive method, the acetogenic bacterium or knallgas bacterium is contacted with the gas mixture in an aqueous medium. In a preferred embodiment, the term “aqueous medium” comprises any aqueous solution that comprises the amount of salts and buffers necessary to grow or sustain an acetogenic bacterial cell and to sustain acetogenesis. For example, an aqueous medium according to Hurst, K. M., and Lewis, R. (2010), Biochemical Engineering Journal 2010, 48, 159-165 may be used to carry out the inventive teachings. The temperature in steps a) and b) needs to be chosen bearing in mind the needs of the acetogenic bacterium or knallgas bacterium on the one hand and thermodynamic parameters on the other hand. The state of the art teaches ranges of temperatures as well as optimum temperatures for a vast range of acetogenic bacteria. For example, Clostridium thermoaceticum may be incubated at temperatures of up to 60° C. See also standard textbooks of microbiology for temperatures that may be used to grow acetogenic bacterial and archaeal cells, for example Dworkin et al. (2006) The Prokaryotes—A Handbook on the Biology of Bacteria, Volume 2. In a preferred embodiment, the temperature applied in step a) is, in order of increasing preference, 0 to 100° C., 10 to 80° C., 20 to 60° C., 30 to 45° C. or 35 to 42° C. In another preferred embodiment, the temperature applied in step a) is 37° C. or more. The invention is further illustrated by the following figures and non-limiting examples from which further features, embodiments, aspects and advantages of the present invention may be taken. FIG. 1 shows calculated data for hydrogen conversion efficiency out of biomass concentrations of 0-60 g/L and 2-HIB product concentrations of 0-100 g/L.

EXAMPLE 1 Biotechnological Production of 2-Hydroxyisobutyric Acid Using a Genetically Modified Strain of Cupriavidus necator H16 PHB-4 [47] DSM 541 Methods Bacterial Strains and Plasmids Cupriavidus necator H16 PHB-4 [47] DSM 541 was obtained from the DSMZ (Leibniz-Institut DSMZ—Deutsche Sammiung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) and modified by introducing the plasmid pBBR1MCS-2:HCM (Reinecke L, Schaffer S, Marx A, Pötter M, Haas T (2009) Recombinant cell producing 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid. WO/2009/156214), which originates from broad host range cloning vector pBBR1MCS (Kovach M E, Elzer P H, Hill D S, Robertson G T, Farris M A, Roop R M, Peterson K M (1995) Four new derivatives of the broad-host-range cloning vector pBBR1MCS, carrying different antibiotic-resistance cassettes. Gene 166(1):175-6). The plasmid contains the genes hcmA and hcmB coding for the two subunits of the 2-hydroxy-isobutyryl-coenzyme A mutase from Aquincola tertiaricarbonis (Yaneva N, Schuster J, Schäfer F, Lede V, Przybyiski D, Paproth T, Harms H, Müller R H, Rohwerder T (2012) A bacterial acyl-CoA mutase specifically catalyzes coenzyme B12-dependent isomerization of 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA and (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. J Biol Chem. doi:10.1074/jbc.M111.314690). Cultivation Conditions General cultivation was done in Luria Bertani broth (Miller) at 30° C. and the strain was stored on LB-agar plates at 4° C. For batch and continuous cultivations a mineral salt medium was used as described by Schlegel and co-authors (Schlegel H G, Kaltwasser H, Gottschalk G (1961) Ein Submersverfahren zur Kultur wasserstoffoxydierender Bakterien: Wachstumsphysiologische Untersuchungen. Arch Microbiol 38(3):209-222) supplied with kanamycin. Cultivations were carried out in lab-scale with shaking flasks containing 0.6 L working volume at 22° C. Agitation was set to 200 rpm and aeration was kept constant at 5 L/h. Pre-cultures were prepared from single colonies at 30° C. and 150 rpm in 200 mL of the same medium but fructose as sole carbon source substrate and under aerobic conditions. After fructose exhaustion the culture was shifted to hydrogen and carbon dioxide and cultivation continued under batch conditions. The two gases in addition to oxygen were supplied from a storage tank of 18 L treated according to the gasometer principle. The initial gas concentrations were about 25-50% H2, 15-30% CO2 and 10-20% 02. Gases were offered to the culture via a hollow fiber module (Fresenius, St. Wendel, Germany) by a membrane pump at rate of 750 Uh. Hollow fibers had a pore width of 0.2 μm and a specific exchange area of 0.7 m2. The external volume of the hollow fiber module was flushed with the bacterial suspension at a rate of 750 L/h, fed with a gear pump. After passage through the module, gases and suspension were carried in a flask equipped with a stirrer. Gases were re-circulated to the gas tank and mixed with the residing gases by a propeller by means of a magnet-coupled motor installed outside of the tank. Consumption of gases was monitored in terms of total volume registering the horizontal movement of the gas tank and in terms of concentration by three specific sensors. Furthermore, gas consumption was calculated from the differential changes of total gas and Individual gas concentrations. If required specific gases were refilled to the gas tank. As there was no automated pH control in this simplified cultivation system, pH was monitored off-line and adjusted to pH 7.5 by adding required volumes of 10% NaOH according to a titration curve based on the growth medium. On-Line Analysis Gas concentrations were measured by specific sensors for hydrogen (0-100%), oxygen (0-50%) and carbon dioxide (0-50%) (BlueSens, Herten, Germany) and their concentrations continuously monitored. Tubing of the cultivation system was arranged in a way that allowed measuring the gases from inflow as well as outflow. Off-Line Analysis Biomass concentration was determined by optical density at 700 nm and gravimetrically in quadruplicate after oven-drying at 105° C. Substrate consumption and 2-HIB synthesis were analyzed by isocratic HPLC (Shimadzu) on a Nucleogel Ion 300OA column (300 mm×7.8 mm, Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany) at 70° C. with 0.6 mL/min 0.01 N H2SO4 as eluant. Calculations: 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) was defined as the central carbon precursor [51, 52] from which the complete biomass synthesis was derived. The molar composition of biomass in the model was taken as C4H8O2N. It is synthesized from ATP as the general energy carrier and proceeds with an efficiency of 10.5 g dry mass pro mol ATP (Stouthamer A H (1973) A theoretical study on the amount of ATP required for synthesis of microbial cell material. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek 39(3):545-65). The overall balance equation for biomass synthesis from PGA is accordingly: [in-line-formulae]4PGA+29.1ATP+3NH3+5.5[2H]->3C4H8O2N+10H2O [1][/in-line-formulae] [2H] stands for reduction equivalents which correspond in general to NAD(P)H+H+. Results and Discussion To define possible product yields in a growth associated process we implied a stoichiometric model. Knallgas bacteria like C. necator use the Calvin cycle to assimilate carbon and the enzyme hydrogenase to gain NAD(P)H+H+ from hydrogen as substrate for oxidative phosphorylation via the respiratory chain as well as source for carbon dioxide reduction. Therefore, the overall balance equation for biomass synthesis via PGA including energy generation from H2 oxidation at P/O=2 results in [in-line-formulae]12CO2+3NH3+56.05[H2]+15.28O2->3C4H8O2N+48.55H2O (eq. 2)[/in-line-formulae] With respect to growth this corresponds to a carbon conversion efficiency of CCE of 1 Cmol incorporated per Cmol supplied and a HCE (hydrogen conversion efficiency) of 0.214 Hmol assimilated per Hmol consumed. Synthesis of 2-HIB (C4H8O3) as desired product via the Calvin cycle with PGA and pyruvate as intermediates results in acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) according to [in-line-formulae]4CO2+8[H2]+14ATP->2AcCoA+4H2O (eq. 3a)[/in-line-formulae] The ATP required for CO2 fixation is obtained from hydrogen oxidation via the respiratory chain; accordingly eq. 3a is extended to [in-line-formulae]4CO2+16[H2]+3.5O2->2-HIB+12H2O (eq. 3b)[/in-line-formulae] The CCE is again 1 Cmol/Cmol, whereas the theoretical HCE is 0.25 Hmol/Hmol (eq. 3b). Combining biomass synthesis and product formation to an integral process, the interdependency between both processes defining the final HCE with respect to product is shown in FIG. 1. We took into account two ranges of biomass concentration extending from 0 to 10 g/L and from 10 to 60 g/L to consider a wide spectrum of variables. Obviously, biomass synthesis is very costly (eq. 2). It is apparent that the overall process approaches a value of 0.2 to 0.25 Hmol/Hmol when the biomass concentration is below 10 g/L and the product concentration moves towards 100 g/L (FIG. 1). Both, the increase in biomass and the reduction of product concentration, drastically decrease the HCE. We used the strain C. necator H16 PHB-4 (Schlaegel H G, Lafferty R, Krauss 1 (1970) The isolation of mutants not accumulating poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid. Arch Microbiol 71(3):283-294), which is deficient in PHB synthesis due to knock-out of the PHB polymerase gene. This allowed this strain to synthesize metabolites up to 3-HB-CoA under conditions of overflow metabolism. Cloning and expressing the 2-HIB-CoA mutase from A. tertiarcarbonis established the alternative/additional route for our desired dead-end product, 2-HIB. To proof the capacity of the chosen system for 2-HIB synthesis the strain, pre-grown on fructose, was used to inoculate the cultivation apparatus. A gas stream containing 25-50% H2, 15-30% CO2 and 10-20% O2 was supplied as growth substrate therefore resulting in the induction of the enzymes required for chemo-litho-autotrophic growth, especially hydrogenases (Lenz O, Schwartz E, Dernedde J, Eltinger M, Friedrich B (1994) The Alcaligenes eutrophus H16 hoxX gene participates in hydrogenase regulation. J Bacteriol 176(14):4385-93; Burgdorf T, Lenz q, Buhrke T, van der Linden E, Jones A K, Albracht S P, Friedrich B (2005) [NiFe]-hydrogenases of Ralstonia eutropha H16: modular enzymes for oxygen-tolerant biological hydrogen oxidation. J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol 10(2-4):181-96) and for carbon dioxide fixation (Husemann M. Klintworth R, Büttcher V, Salnikow J, Weissenborn C, Bowien B (1988) Chromosomally and plasmid-encoded gene dusters for CO2 fixation (cfx genes) in Alcaligenes eutrophus. Mol Gen Genet MGG 214(1):112-120)). Under these conditions growth preceded at a rate of about 0.058/h until the nitrogen source was exhausted, attaining a final biomass concentration of approx. 2.0 g/L (FIG. 2). During exponential growth carbon dioxide was incorporated into biomass with a CCE=0.58 Cmol/Cmol. Hydrogen conversion yielded an HCE of 0.0715 Hmol/Hmol. It should be noted that the theoretical maximum possible value of HCE with 0.214 Hmol/Hmol can not be attained due to requirements of energy (H2) necessary for maintenance purposes. Larger deviations from the theoretical values might be caused by the synthesis of products other than biomass, such as pyruvate. More detailed analyses, however, were not undertaken at this stage of investigation. During biomass growth 2-HIB was found of only at low concentration. After exhaustion of the nitrogen source, however, there was a steep increase in external 2-HIB concentration (FIG. 2). The synthesis rate corresponded to 8.35 mg 2-HIB/(g dry mass h). This rate was stable up to a concentration of approx. 410 mg/L. Subsequently the product synthesis rate suddenly ceased which was likewise observed in repeated experiments. The abrupt shift indicated a distinct limitation/disturbance not obvious from the experimental setup but requiring further optimization. The amount of gases consumed per increment of 2-HIB was used to calculate the yield coefficients. The data was corrected for unspecific loss of gases determined by running experiments in the absence of biomass. The remaining was incorporated into 2-HIB with a CCE of 0.178 Cmol/Cmol. Hydrogen as second substrate was converted into this product with a HCE of 0.032 Hmol/Hmol. Noticeably, this is far from the above stated limit values. The deficit in the balance of substrates can likely be explained by the putative synthesis of products other than 2-HIB. Taking into account the reduction of CO2 by hydrogen to yield the first intermediate of carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP, C3H6O3, phosphate-free sum formula), the CO2 available due to the present consumption characteristic will allow the synthesis of 0.57 mmol GAP per hour in the linear phase of 2-HIB formation. This in turn requires 5.16 mmol H2/h based on [in-line-formulae]3CO2+9[H2]+1.5O2->GAP(C3H6O3)+6H2O (eq. 4)[/in-line-formulae] Due to the hydrogen balance 5.71 mmol H2 remain available after 2-HIB synthesis which could satisfy the putative product synthesis. Moreover, some hydrogen further remains available for maintenance purposes which are inevitably necessary in living cells. Taking into account the specific maintenance coefficient determined formerly for Ralstonia eutropha (C. necator) JMP 134 on fructose of ms=0.09 mmol/(g dry mass h) [57] and converting this substrate-based coefficient into an energy (ATP)-based value (P/O=2) which would be equivalent to me=2.34 mmol ATP/(g dry mass h) the hydrogen remaining after 2-HIB synthesis and putative other reduced products would be sufficient to generate 2.8 mmol ATP/(g dry mass h). This is in pretty coincidence with former results to this species. 1: A knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium expressing a 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-coenzyme A mutase. 2: The knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium according to claim 1, wherein the bacterium is genetically modified such that it has, compared to the respective wild type strain, a reduced capacity to synthesise polyhydroxybutyrate. 3: The knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium according to claim 2, wherein the bacterium has a polyhydroxybutyrate synthase gene knockout. 4: The knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium according to claim 1, wherein the bacterium is incapable of synthesising polyhydroxybutyrate. 5: The knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium according to claim 1, wherein the bacterium is a knallgas bacterium selected from the group consisting of Methanobacterium, Acetobacterium, Desulfovibrio, Desulfomonas, Paracoccus, Achromobacter, Alcaligenes, Pseudomonas, Nocardia and Cupriavidus, or an acetogenic bacterium selected from the group consisting of Clostridium, Moorella and Acetoanaerobium, Acetobacterium, Archaeoglobus, Butyribacterium, Carboxydibrachium, Carboxydocella, Carboxydothermus, Citrobacter, Desulfotomaculum, Eubacterium, Methanosarcina, Methanothermobacter, Oxobacter Peptostreptococcus, Rhodopseudomonas, Rhodospirillum, Rubrivivax, Thermincola, Thermococcus, Thermolithobacter, Thermoanaerobacter and Thermosyntrophicum. 6: The knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium according to claim 1, wherein the bacterium expresses a nucleic acid comprising SEQ ID NO 1 or a variant thereof or a polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid or a variant of the polypeptide and expresses a nucleic acid comprising SEQ ID NO 2 or a variant thereof or a polypeptide encoded by the latter nucleic acid or a variant of the latter polypeptide. 7: The knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium according to claim 1, further expressing a MeaB protein or a variant thereof. 8: The knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium according to claim 1, wherein the bacterium is capable of synthesizing 3-Hydroxybutyryl-Coenzym A. 9: The knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium according to claim 1, further expressing a β-ketothiolase and an acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. 10: A method for the production of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid, comprising contacting in an aqueous medium the knallgas bacterium or acetogenic bacterium according to claim 1 with a gas mixture comprising hydrogen and carbon dioxide. 11: The method according to claim 10, wherein a hydrogen partial pressure in the gas mixture is from 0.1 to 100 bar, and a carbon dioxide partial pressure is from 0.03 to 100 bar. 12: The method according to claim 10, wherein the bacterium tolerates the presence of oxygen and the aqueous solution is aerobic. 13: The method according to claim 10, wherein the bacterium tolerates the presence of oxygen and the gas mixture comprises oxygen in addition to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. 14: The method according to claim 10, wherein the aqueous medium does not comprise carbohydrates. 15: The method according to claim 10, wherein the contacting is carried out in the absence of a growth-limiting nutrient other than a carbon. 16: The method according to claim 10, wherein the contacting is carried out at 20 to 37° C. 17.
