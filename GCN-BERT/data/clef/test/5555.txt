The present invention concerns the use of a combination of an amphoteric surfactant and a cationic polymer derivative of polysaccharide to increase the foam volume and foam quality of soap containing compositions. Said advantage may be used to produce cleansing products like cleansing liquid, paste, gel or foam, body shampoo or hair shampoo. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Soaps representing salts of fatty acids with alkali are a mainstay for many skin cleansers. When properly formulated they provide rich and creamy lather together with excellent rinsability and squeaky clean perception. However soap-based compositions are relatively harsh to the skin with tight skin feel, have problems with stability in liquid form and do not foam well in hard water and form lime soap upon rinsing. In order to address these issues various surfactants, polymers and solvents have been added to the soaps since decades. Although some of the major problematic issues could be resolved in this way, the composition cost is usually increased due to the additional ingredients. Also very often the improvement of one property impairs another one. For example the addition of high concentration of surfactants may increase the product mildness and the foaminess, especially in hard water, but could deteriorate the foam creaminess and the product rinsability. Similarly the addition of high amount of polymers, especially cationic ones, may increase the foam creaminess and the product mildness and stability, but will affect also the product rinsability and the wet skin afterfeel. Creating a cost effective, mild and stable soap-based composition with good foamability and rinsability and with pronounced foam creaminess is still a big challenge to the formulators. INVENTION Unexpectedly, it appears now that the combination of an amphoteric surfactant of formula (I) with a cationic polymer derivative of polysaccharide has a strong synergistic action in soap-based formulations, imparting mildness to the composition, creating rich and creamy foam upon application with excellent skin conditioning properties and leaving the skin with moist feel. The present invention concerns then the use of a combination of a compound of formula (I) and a cationic polymer derivative of polysaccharide to increase the foam volume and foam quality of a soap containing aqueous composition; said composition comprising at least: (1) 0.5 to 85% by weight, preferably 5 to 35% by weight, of carboxylic acids having 8 to 24 carbon atoms, and salts thereof; (2) 0.5 to 15% by weight of an amphoteric surfactant of formula (I) as follows: [in-line-formulae]R1—(CONH)a—(CH2)b—N+(R2)(R3)(R4)Z+ (I)[/in-line-formulae] wherein: a is 0 or 1;b is comprised between 1 and 3;R1 is an alkyl or alkenyl hydrocarbon chain comprising from 7 to 21 carbon atoms;R2 is an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or —(CH2)cOH with c is comprised between 1 and 3;R3 is H, an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or —(CH2)dCOO− with d is comprised between 1 and 3;R4 is —(CH2)eCOO− with e is comprised between 1 and 3; or —(CH2)fCH(OH)—CH2—SO3− with f is comprised between 1 and 3; andZ is a monovalent cation.

The present invention is then relative to the use of a compound of formula (I) and a cationic polymer derivative of polysaccharide to increase the foam volume and foam quality of a soap containing aqueous composition. The invention is also relative to the use of a combination of components (1), (2) and (3) to obtain a foam product.

This well-known test, notably as described in the experimental part, provides information about the foam viscosity and foam elasticity, as well for the foam-surface friction, which are among the main factors affecting the consumer perception about the foam quality. Compositions of the invention may be formulated for washing skin and/or hair, for example, bath or shower gels, handwashing compositions, facial washing compositions, pre- and post-shaving products, and rinse-off and wipe-off skin care products, and mainly to produce cleansing foam, body shampoo and hair shampoo.

Procedure All examples were prepared according to the typical procedure described below: 1) Mixture of fatty acids and BHT was heated to 75° C. until becoming fluid (mixture-1); 2) Mixture of potassium hydroxide, glycerine and water was heated to 75° C. (mixture-2); 3) Mixture 2 was added to mixture-1 with agitation (mixture-3); 4) SLES and 4NaEDTA, pre-dissolved in water, and CMEA (if present) were added to mixture-3 (mixture-4). 5) EGDS was added into mixture-4 and after it was dissolved the mixture was cooled to 50° C.; 6) Amphoteric surfactant dissolved in water was added into mixture-4 (mixture-5); 7) A dispersion of cationic guar polymer, together with the thickening polymer, e.g. HEC in propylene glycol was added into mixture-5 and the temperature was decreased to 30° C. while stirring (mixture-6); 8) Preservative was then added. Protocols Foam Volume and Foam Drainage Test A solution containing 2% by wt. of the composition in water containing 50 ppm CaCl2 was prepared and stirred for 5 minutes. Than a 200 g of this solution were transferred in the jar of a kitchen blender NATIONAL model MX-795N. The solution was stirred for 15 seconds and transferred carefully in a 1000 ml measuring cylinder. The foam volume was recorded and the foam drainage, i.e. the volume of the liquid below the foam was tracked for 15 minutes. The foam drainage value mentioned in this document is the volume of the liquid 5 minutes after the transfer into the measuring cylinder. At least two experiments were done and the average value was taken. When the volume is bigger and the drainage value is smaller than the foam is considered better. Foam Quality Test A solution of the composition in water containing 50 ppm CaCl2 was prepared and stirred for 5 minutes. Unless otherwise stated the concentration of the solution was 3% by wt. After that the solution was foamed in the abovementioned kitchen blender for 1 minute and the produced foam was transferred in a funnel placed on a laboratory sieve No 18 with 1 mm mesh size, unless otherwise stated. The funnel was plastic with 150 mm diameter, 25 mm opening and 125 mm height. It has a steel wire at 67 mm height which serves as a mark. When the foam from the blender is poured into the funnel it goes through the sieve into a stainless steel container. The time which is needed for the foam surface to reach the metal wire is recorded. Foam with longer residence time is considered better. All experiments were made at least two times and the results were averaged. Sometimes the different compositions required different concentrations and/or mesh size for this test in order to be able to better distinguish between them and this is indicated in the results provided. This test provide information about the foam viscosity and foam elasticity, as well for the foam-surface friction, which are among the main factors affecting the consumer perception about the foam quality.
