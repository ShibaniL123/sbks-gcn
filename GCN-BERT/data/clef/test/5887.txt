BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Oral care implements, especially toothbrushes, are used by many people on a daily basis. Typical oral care implements comprise an elongate handle and a head connected to one end of the handle. The handle provides a structure by which a user grips and manipulates the oral care implement during use. The head typically comprises one or more elements designed to perform their intended function, such as teeth cleaning elements, soft tissue cleaning elements, and/or oral care agents. Over the years, efforts have been made to improve the design of handles of oral care implements, in order to provide users with increased control of the implements and improved reach of the elements comprised in the heads, in order that the oral care implements may deliver improved cleaning of users' oral cavities during oral care sessions. Such efforts have included the development of handles having multiple components, including a hard core structure and softer gripping covers or grip bodies, in an attempt to increase users' control of the implements. Other existing oral care implements have handles with sections oriented at selected angles relative to one another and relative to the head of the implements, in an attempt to improve reach, so that previously-difficult-to-reach surfaces in the oral cavity can now be reached with elements. Despite these efforts, a need still exists for an oral care implement that has a structure that delivers improved cleaning of a user's oral cavity during use. For example, there is a need for an oral care implement that better ensures that element(s) on the head of the implement can reach oral surfaces and depressions and undulations therein, in order to deliver improved cleaning of the oral surfaces. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A first aspect of the present invention provides an oral care implement, comprising: a head having a surface from which a cleaning element extends, the cleaning element having a distal end furthest from the surface of the head; and a handle connected to the head, the handle comprising a grip structure forming at least a portion of an exterior surface of the handle; wherein the grip structure is rotatable relative to the head about an axis that passes through the cleaning element at a point on the cleaning element between the surface of the head and the distal end of the cleaning element.

Moreover, the features and benefits of the invention are illustrated by reference to the preferred embodiments. Accordingly, the invention expressly should not be limited to such preferred embodiments illustrating some possible non-limiting combination of features that may exist alone or in other combinations of features. In the following description, the invention is embodied in a manually-operated oral care implement, more specifically a manually-operated toothbrush. However, in other embodiments, the invention is embodied in a powered toothbrush wherein one or more cleaning elements provided to the head of the implement are drivable so as to be moved relative to the handle of the implement. In still further embodiments, the invention may be embodied in other forms of oral care implements, such as a soft-tissue cleansing implement, an inter-proximal pick, a flossing tool, a plaque scraper, or another ansate implement designed for oral care. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilised, and that structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate an oral care implement, in this case a toothbrush, according to a first embodiment of the present invention, generally designated with the reference numeral 100. The toothbrush 100 generally comprises a handle 110 and a head 120. The handle 110 provides the user with a mechanism by which he/she can readily grip and manipulate the toothbrush 100. The handle 110 includes ergonomic features which provide a high degree of control for the user while maintaining comfort. The head 120 has a proximal portion 121 and a distal portion 122. The head 120 includes, at its proximal portion 121, a neck 123 connected to a distal end 104 of the handle 110. The neck 123 is generally of a narrower cross sectional area than at least the distal end 104 of the handle 110 and, in some embodiments, the neck 123 is generally of a narrower cross sectional area than all of the handle 110. The head also includes, at its distal portion, a plurality of tooth cleaning elements 130, which are generically illustrated as a block. Generally, the toothbrush 100 extends from a proximal end 101 (which is also the proximal end 103 of the handle 110) to a distal end 102 (which is at the distal end of the distal portion 122 of the head 120) along a longitudinal axis A-A. Although the handle 110 is a non-linear structure in the illustrated embodiment, the longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100 is linear in the illustrated embodiment. However, the invention is not so limited, and in certain embodiments, the implement 100 may have a simple linear handle 110 that is longitudinally aligned along the linear longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100. The head 120 is connected to the handle 110. As discussed in greater detail below, in this embodiment the head 120 is connected to a body 140 (discussed in greater detail below) of the handle 110 of the toothbrush 100, with the head 120 and body 140 being formed as an integral structure using an injection molding process. The body 140 is immovable relative to the head 120. The body 140 and the head 120 are a single, unitary structure. However, in other embodiments, the head 120 and the body 140 may be formed as separate components which are operably connected at a later stage of the manufacturing process by any suitable technique known in the art, including without limitation thermal welding, sonic welding, a tight-fit assembly, a coupling sleeve, adhesion, fasteners, and a snap-fit connection. Whether the head 120 and the body 140 are constructed as a single piece or a multi-piece assembly (including connection techniques) is not limiting of the present invention in all embodiments. Furthermore, other manufacturing techniques may be used in place of and/or in addition to injection molding to create the handle 110 and/or the head 120 (or components thereof), such as milling and/or machining. In this embodiment, each of the head 120 and the body 140 are constructed of a hard or rigid material, specifically the hard plastic polypropylene (PP). However, in variations to this embodiment, the head 120 may instead or additionally be constructed of one or more of the following hard or rigid materials: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polyester, cellulosics, styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), acrylic, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and a thermoplastic. Also, in variations to this embodiment, the body 140 may instead or additionally be constructed of one or more of the following hard or rigid materials: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polyester, cellulosics, styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), acrylic, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and a thermoplastic. It should be noted that relative terms such as distal, middle, proximal, upper, lower, top, bottom, lateral, front, rear, left, right etc. are merely used to delineate relative positions of the components of the implement 100 with respect to one another and are not intended to be in any further way limiting of the present invention. The head 120 generally comprises a front surface 124 and a rear surface 125. The front surface 124 and the rear surface 125 of the head 120 can take on a wide variety of shapes and contours, none of which are limiting of the present invention. For example, the front and rear surfaces 124, 125 can be planar, contoured or combinations thereof. The front surface 124 and rear surface 125 are joined by a peripheral or lateral surface 126 of the head 120. The plurality of tooth cleaning elements 130, which are generically illustrated as a block, are provided on and extend outward from the front surface 124 of the head 120 for cleaning contact with an oral surface, preferably teeth. While the set of cleaning elements 130 is particularly suited for brushing teeth, the set of cleaning elements 130 can also be used to clean oral soft tissue, such as a tongue, gums, or cheeks instead of or in addition to teeth. As used herein, the term “cleaning element” is used in a generic sense to refer to any structure that can be used to clean or massage an oral surface, such as teeth or soft tissue, through relative surface contact. In this embodiment, a plurality of cleaning elements 130 is provided. However, in a variation to this embodiment, only one cleaning element 130 is provided. Also, in this embodiment, the cleaning elements 130 comprise a plurality of bristles. However, in variations to this embodiment, the cleaning elements may additionally or alternatively comprise any one or more of the following, without limitation: filament bristles, fiber bristles, nylon bristles, spiral bristles, rubber bristles, elastomeric protrusions, flexible polymer protrusions, co-extruded filaments, flag bristles, crimped bristles, anti-bacterial bristles and combinations thereof and/or structures containing such materials or combinations. The plurality of cleaning elements 130 can be connected to the head 120 in any manner known in the art. For example, anchor free tufting (AFT) could be used to connect the cleaning elements 130. In AFT, a plate or membrane is secured to the brush head 120 such as by ultrasonic welding. The bristles (or other elements, such as elastomeric elements) extend through the plate or membrane. The free, distal ends 131 of the bristles 130 on one side of the plate or membrane perform the cleaning function. The ends of the bristles 130 on the other side of the plate or membrane are melted together by heat to be anchored in place. Any suitable form of cleaning elements 130 may be used in the broad practice of this invention. Alternatively, the cleaning elements 130 could be mounted to tuft blocks or sections by extending through suitable openings in the tuft blocks so that the base of the cleaning elements 130 is mounted within or below the tuft block. Staple technology may instead be used. Regardless as to the type and number of cleaning elements 130 provided, the or each cleaning element 130 has its distal end 131 furthest from the front surface 124 of the head 120. As illustrated in FIG. 1, at least one cleaning element 130 extends from the front surface 124 of the head 120 so that the longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100 passes through the, some or each of the cleaning element(s) 130. For each of the cleaning element(s) 130 that the longitudinal axis A-A passes through, the axis A-X passes through the cleaning element 130 at a point on the cleaning element 130 between the front surface 124 of the head 120 and the free, distal end 131 of the cleaning element 130. The significance of this feature is explained below. If desired, the rear surface 125 of the head 120 may comprise one or more structures for oral cleaning, such as one or more soft tissue cleansers (as shown in FIGS. 8(b) to 8(d)). Such soft tissue cleansers may be constructed of a thermoplastic elastomer (“TPE”) and may include one or more projections, such as nubs and/or ridges, for engaging and massaging soft oral tissue, such as the tongue. The handle 110 of the implement 100 of this embodiment comprises, in addition to the body 140, a grip structure 150, or “grip”. The grip structure 150 forms a portion of an exterior surface 111 of the handle 110, and comprises a plurality of protrusions 158, such as one or more of nubs, bumps, ridges and ribs. The protrusions 158 provide the grip structure 150 with a textured surface, which aids a user's holding and manipulating of the implement 100 during an oral care session. In this embodiment, the grip structure 150 consists of only one piece. In this embodiment, the grip structure 150 is constructed of a resilient material which, comprises a thermoplastic elastomer. In other embodiments, the resilient material may instead or also comprise styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS). In still further embodiments, the grip structure 150 may instead or additionally be constructed of one or more hard or rigid materials, such as hard plastic. The hard or rigid material may comprise any one or more of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polyester, cellulosics, styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), acrylic, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and a thermoplastic. For example, as shown in FIG. 3 (discussed in more detail below), a second embodiment of the oral care implement 100 according to the present invention comprises a grip structure 150 having a first piece or portion 151 constructed of resilient material, which in the second embodiment is a thermoplastic elastomer, and a second piece or portion 152 connected to the first piece 151 and constructed of hard or rigid material, which in the second embodiment is a hard plastic, such as polypropylene. Returning to the first embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2, the grip structure 150 comprises a sleeve having an interior surface 153 that defines an interior cavity of the sleeve. The grip structure 150 and the body 140 are relatively arranged so that a first portion 145 of the body 140 is disposed within the interior cavity of the sleeve. The interior surface 153 of the grip structure 150 and an exterior surface 143 of the first portion 145 of the body 140 are dimensioned so as to permit movement of the grip structure 150 relative to the body 140. That is, a clearance in the form of an annular gap is provided between the interior surface 153 and the exterior surface 143. In the present embodiment, in which both of the interior surface 153 of the grip structure 150 and the exterior surface 143 of the portion of the body 140 are cylindrical, the diameter of the interior surface 153 is slightly greater than the diameter of the exterior surface 143. The grip structure 150 is connected or mounted to the body 140 so as to be rotatable relative to the body 140. Moreover, the grip structure 150 is connected or mounted to the body 140 so as to be rotatable relative to the head 120, and thus relative to the cleaning element(s) 130. The grip structure 150 is rotatable relative to the body 140 and relative to the head 120 about the longitudinal axis A-A of the oral care implement 100. In this embodiment, the grip structure 150 is rotatable through 360 degrees (indeed, through more than 360 degrees) about the longitudinal axis A-A relative to the body 140 and relative to the head 120. Moreover, the grip structure 150 is free to rotate about the longitudinal axis A-A relative to the body 140 and relative to the head 120. That is, rotation of the grip structure 150 relative to the body 140 and relative to the head 120 is unrestricted by any other part of the implement 100 so, for example, the grip structure 150 not biased to a particular angular position relative to the body 140 or relative to the head 120. Rotation of the grip structure 150 relative to the head 120 is illustrated in FIG. 1. An alternative position of the head 120 relative to the grip structure 150 is shown in dashed lines, this position being reached following relative rotational movement between the head 120 and the grip structure 150. This relative rotation is further illustrated in FIGS. 8(a) to 8(d). In each of FIGS. 8(a) to 8(d), the grip structure 150 is at the same position relative to the page, but the head 120 (and the body 140) are rotated through 90 degrees between successive Figures. The skilled person would be able to understand the similar relative rotational movement between the head 120 and the grip structure 150 in an embodiment of the implement 100 that excludes the body 140 (such as the fifth embodiment, discussed below). The body 140 of the implement 100 of this embodiment comprises a first part 141, which includes the first portion 145 of the body 140 having the exterior surface 143 discussed above, and a second part 142. The two parts 141, 142 are two pieces of the body 140 connected together although, in a variation to this embodiment, the two parts 141, 142 could be a single, unitary piece. The first part 141 has a surface 141a , which is non-parallel to the longitudinal axis A-A, against which surface 141a a first axial end 150a of the gripping structure 150 abuts. With the first axial end 150a of the gripping structure 150 abutting the surface 141a of the first part 141, a second portion 146 of the first part 141 is not disposed within the internal cavity of the grip structure 150 but, instead, protrudes from a second axial end 150b of the grip structure 150. The second part 142 of the body 140 is connected to the first part 141 of the body 140 by any means, such as adhesive, welding, bonding, snap-fit connection, mating screw-threads, etc. The second part 142 has a surface 142a , which is non-parallel to the longitudinal axis A-A, against which surface 142a the second axial end 150b of the gripping structure 150 abuts. Accordingly, the grip structure 150 is disposed between the two parts 141, 142 of the body 140 so that the grip structure 150 is axially fixed relative to the body 140 and relative to the head 120 by the two parts 141, 142 of the body 140. In a variation to the described embodiment, the axial length of the gripping structure 150 may be slightly shorter than the axial distance between the surface 141a of the first part 141 and the surface 142a of the second part 142, so that the first axial end 150a of the gripping structure 150 may not abut the surface 141a of the first part 141 at the same time as the second axial end 150b of the gripping structure 150 abuts the surface 142a of the second part 142, whereby a small degree of axial movement of the gripping structure 150 relative to the body 140 is permitted. Preferably the axial length of the gripping structure 150 is at least 90% of the axial distance between the surface 141a of the first part 141 and the surface 142a of the second part 142. More preferably, the axial length of the gripping structure 150 is at least 95% of the axial distance between the surface 141a of the first part 141 and the surface 142a of the second part 142. In a variation to the illustrated first embodiment, the grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140 by a snap-fit connection, while still being rotatable about the axis A-A relative to the body 140 and head 120. As discussed above, the grip structure 150 is rotatable about the longitudinal axis A-A relative to the head 120, and thus relative to the cleaning element(s) 130. Moreover, as also discussed above, the at least one cleaning element 130 extends from the front surface 124 of the head 120 so that the longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100 passes through the, some or each of the cleaning elements 130. For each of the cleaning element(s) 130 that the longitudinal axis A-A passes through, the axis A-X passes through the cleaning element 130 at a point on the cleaning element 130 between the front surface 124 of the head 120 and the free, distal end 131 of the cleaning element 130. Accordingly, the oral care implement 100 has an “oral surface self-tracking function” during use in an oral care session. That is, as the cleaning element(s) 130 are moved across teeth, soft tissue or another oral surface, the head 120 and cleaning element(s) 130 rotate relative to the grip structure 150 to follow the oral surface, without the user needing to change their grip on the grip structure 150. Accordingly, without the user needing to move the surface of their hand and/or digits relative to the exterior surface of the grip structure 150, the cleaning element(s) 130 are free to follow the contours and undulations of the oral surface being cleaned. This provides improved cleaning of the user's oral cavity, since it is better ensured that the cleaning element(s) 130 on the head 120 of the implement 100 can reach and contact the oral surfaces to be cleaned. In the present embodiment, the point on the cleaning element(s) 130 through which the axis A-A passes is at a location between the distal end 131 and the front surface 124 of the head 120. For at least some of the cleaning elements 130, the point may be at the respective distal ends 131 of the cleaning elements 130, which may better ensure that the distal ends 131 of the cleaning elements 130 track the oral surface being cleaned. For one or more other of the cleaning elements 130, the point is spaced from the respective distal ends 131 of the cleaning element(s) 130, which may better ensure that the cleaning elements 130 apply a force to the oral surface being cleaned, particularly if the cleaning elements 130 are resilient. In any case, preferably the point is closer to the distal ends 131 of the cleaning elements 130 than to the front surface 124 of the head 120. The oral care implement 100 of the first embodiment may be manufactured as follows. As a first step, the head 120 and the body 140 of the handle 110 are provided. They may be formed together during manufacture as a single, unitary piece, such as using an injection molding process, a milling process, and/or a machining process. Alternatively, the head 120 and body 140 may be formed initially as two separate pieces, such as by any of an injection molding process, a milling process, and/or a machining process, and subsequently connected to each other at a later stage of the manufacturing process by any suitable technique known in the art, including without limitation thermal welding, sonic welding, a tight-fit assembly, a coupling sleeve, adhesion, fasteners, and a snap-fit connection. As a second step, the head 120 is provided with the at least one cleaning element 130 that extends from the front surface 124 of the head 120. This may be by any of the techniques discussed above, such as through AFT, through the use of staples, or otherwise. The or each of the at least one cleaning element 130 may take any of the forms discussed above, such as a tooth cleaning element, a soft tissue cleaning elements, a bristle, an elastomeric element, etc. As a subsequent third step, the grip structure 150 is provided and connected to the body 140, optionally by a snap-fit connection, so as to be rotatable relative to the body 140 about the longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100, the grip structure 150 forming at least a portion of the exterior surface 111 of the handle 110. As discussed above, the axis A-A passes through the at least one cleaning element 130 at a point on the cleaning element 130 between the front surface 124 of the head 120 and the distal end 131 of the cleaning element 130. The grip structure 150 is disposed between the two parts 141, 142 of the body 140 so that the grip structure 150 is axially fixed relative to the body 140 and head 120 by the two parts 141, 142. That is, the sleeve of the grip structure 150 is slid over the body 140 so that the first portion 145 of the body 140 becomes located within the interior cavity of the sleeve. The second part 142 of the body is then connected to the first part 141 of the body by any of the mechanisms discussed above, so as to trap the grip structure 150 between the two parts 141, 142. The grip structure 150 may be provided by being made by any one of an injection molding process, a milling process, and/or a machining process. In a variation to this method, the third step may be carried out before or at the same time as the second step. A second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 3. The second embodiment comprises all of the above-described elements of the first embodiment of the present invention, and the like elements are indicated in FIG. 3 with the same reference numerals as used in FIGS. 1 and 2. In the interests of conciseness, the elements common to the two embodiments will not be described in detail again with reference to FIG. 3. All of the above-described possible variations to the first embodiment are equally applicable to the second embodiment. The oral care implement 100 of the second embodiment differs from the implement 100 of the first embodiment only in the form and construction of the grip structure 150. In the first embodiment, the grip structure 150 consists of only one piece. In the second embodiment, the grip structure consists of two or more pieces connected together. More specifically, the grip structure 150 has a first piece 151 constructed of resilient material, such as a thermoplastic elastomer and/or SEBS, and a second piece 152 constructed of hard or rigid material, in this case a hard plastic, such as polypropylene. The hard or rigid material may alternatively or additionally comprise any of the plastics discussed above. The first piece 151 forms most of the exterior surface of the grip structure 150. In a variation to this embodiment, the first piece 151 may form all of the exterior surface of the grip structure 150. There may be provided a plurality of such first pieces 151, each of which is connected to the second piece 152. In such a variation, the first piece(s) 151 may each comprise a protrusion from the second peice, such as a nub, bump, ridge or rib, to aid a user's grip on the grip structure 150. The grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140 by way of the second piece 152 being connected to, or mounted on, the body 140. The first piece 151 is not directly connected to the body 140, but only is connected to the body 140 indirectly via the second piece 152. The grip structure 150 is disposed between the two parts 141, 142 of the body 140, as discussed above for the first embodiment. Since both the body 140 and the second piece 152 of the grip structure are formed of a hard material, the grip structure 150 is able easily to rotate relative to the body 140 with the body 140 and the second piece 152 contacting one another. However, since the first piece 151 is constructed of a resilient material, the grip structure 150 has a comfortable exterior surface for gripping. Preferably, the coefficient of friction of the exterior surface of the first piece 151 is greater than the coefficient of friction of the interior surface 153 of the second piece 152. The oral care implement 100 of the second embodiment may be manufactured substantially in accordance with the above-described method of manufacture of the first embodiment, differing only in the manner by which the grip structure 150 is provided. According to the second embodiment, the grip structure 150 is made by first forming the second piece 152 of the hard material, for example by way of one of an injection molding process, a milling process, and/or a machining process. The second piece 152 may be rotationally symmetrical and preferably has cylindrical symmetry. The material of the first piece (s) 151 is then moulded onto the second piece 152, such as by injection moulding. A third embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 4. The third embodiment comprises many of the above-described elements of the first embodiment of the present invention, and the like elements are indicated in FIG. 4 with the same reference numerals as used in FIGS. 1 and 2. In the interests of conciseness, the elements common to the two embodiments will not be described in detail again with reference to FIG. 4. All of the above-described possible variations to the first and second embodiments are equally applicable to the third embodiment. In the third embodiment, the handle 110 still comprises a body 140 and a grip structure 150, but the body 140 does not have a part equivalent to the second part 142. The body 140 consists of only one part 141 and is constructed of a hard or rigid material, such as a hard plastic. A portion 145 of the body 140 comprises a sleeve having an interior surface 146 that defines an interior cavity of the sleeve, and a first portion 155 of the grip structure 150 is disposed within the interior cavity of the sleeve. A second portion 157 of the grip structure 150 comprises an exterior surface for holding by a user, which exterior surface forms a portion of the exterior surface 111 of the handle 110. The interior surface 146 of the body 140 and an exterior surface 156 of the first portion 155 of the grip structure 150 are dimensioned so as to permit movement of the grip structure 150 relative to the body 140. That is, a clearance in the form of an annular gap is provided between the interior surface 146 and the exterior surface 156. In the present embodiment, in which both of the interior surface 146 of the body 140 and the exterior surface 156 of the first portion 155 of the grip structure 150 are cylindrical, the diameter of the interior surface 146 is slightly greater than the diameter of the exterior surface 156. The grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140 by way of a snap-fit connection between the grip structure 150 and the body 140, more specifically between a second piece 152 of the grip structure 150 and the body 140. However, in variations to this embodiment, other forms of connection may be used. The grip structure 150 is rotatable relative to the body 140. Moreover, the grip structure 150 is connected or mounted to the body 140 so as to be rotatable relative to the head 120, and thus relative to the cleaning element(s) 130. The grip structure 150 is rotatable relative to the body 140 and relative to the head 120 about the longitudinal axis A-A of the oral care implement 100. In the third embodiment, the grip structure 150 consists of two pieces 151, 152 connected together. More specifically, the grip structure 150 has a first piece 151 constructed of resilient material, such as a thermoplastic elastomer and/or SEBS, and the second piece 152 constructed of hard or rigid material, in this case a hard plastic, such as polypropylene. The hard or rigid material may alternatively or additionally comprise any of the plastics discussed above. The first piece 151 forms most of the exterior surface of the grip structure 150. In a variation to this embodiment, the first piece 151 may form all of the exterior surface of the grip structure 150. The grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140 by way of the second piece 152 being connected to, or mounted on, the body 140. The first piece 151 is not directly connected to the body 140, but only is connected to the body 140 indirectly via the second piece 152. Since both the body 140 and the second piece 152 of the grip structure are formed of a hard material, the grip structure 150 is able easily to rotate relative to the body 140 with the body 140 and the second piece 152 contacting one another. However, since the first piece 151 is constructed of a resilient material, the grip structure 150 has a comfortable exterior surface for gripping. Preferably, the coefficient of friction of the exterior surface of the first piece 151 is greater than the coefficient of friction of the exterior surface 156 of the second piece 152. In a variation to the illustrated third embodiment, the grip structure 150 may consist of only one piece, and may be constructed of any one or more of the materials discussed above for grip structures 150 of the first and second embodiments. The oral care implement 100 of the third embodiment may be manufactured substantially in accordance with the above-described method of manufacture of the second embodiment, differing only in the manner by which the grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140. According to the second embodiment, a portion of the body 140 is disposed within a sleeve of the grip structure 150. In contrast, in the third embodiment, the first portion 155 of the grip structure 150 is disposed within the sleeve of the body 140, and optionally is connected to the body 140 by a snap-fit connection. A fourth embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 5. The fourth embodiment comprises many of the above-described elements of the second embodiment of the present invention, and the like elements are indicated in FIG. 5 with the same reference numerals as used in FIG. 3. In the interests of conciseness, the elements common to the two embodiments will not be described in detail again with reference to FIG. 5. All of the above-described possible variations to the first to third embodiments are equally applicable to the fourth embodiment. In the fourth embodiment, the handle 110 still comprises a body 140 and a grip structure 150 but, in contrast with the second embodiment, the body 140 does not have a part equivalent to the second part 142. The body 140 consists of only one part 141 and is constructed of a hard or rigid material, such as a hard plastic. As for the second embodiment, the grip structure 150 has two pieces 151, 152. The first piece 151 is constructed of resilient material, such as a thermoplastic elastomer and/or SEBS, and the second piece 152 is constructed of hard or rigid material, in this case a hard plastic, such as polypropylene. The hard or rigid material may alternatively or additionally comprise any of the plastics discussed above. The first piece 151 forms most of the exterior surface of the grip structure 150. In a variation to this embodiment, the first piece 151 may only form all of the exterior surface of the grip structure 150. The grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140 by way of the second piece 152 being connected to, or mounted on, the body 140. The first piece 151 is not directly connected to the body 140, but only is connected to the body 140 indirectly via the second piece 152. Since both the body 140 and the second piece 152 of the grip structure are formed of a hard material, the grip structure 150 is able easily to rotate relative to the body 140 with the body 140 and the second piece 152 contacting one another. However, since the first piece 151 is constructed of a resilient material, the grip structure 150 has a comfortable exterior surface for gripping. Preferably, the coefficient of friction of the exterior surface of the first piece 151 is greater than the coefficient of friction of the interior surface 153 of the second piece 152. The grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140 by way of a snap-fit connection between the grip structure 150 and the body 140, more specifically between the second piece 152 of the grip structure 150 and the body 140. However, in variations to this embodiment, other forms of connection may be used. The grip structure 150 is rotatable relative to the body 140. Moreover, the grip structure 150 is connected or mounted to the body 140 so as to be rotatable relative to the head 120, and thus relative to the cleaning element(s) 130. The grip structure 150 is rotatable relative to the body 140 and relative to the head 120 about the longitudinal axis A-A of the oral care implement 100. In a variation to the illustrated fourth embodiment, the grip structure 150 may consist of only one piece, and may be constructed of any one or more of the materials discussed above for grip structures 150 of the first, second and third embodiments. The oral care implement 100 of the fourth embodiment may be manufactured substantially in accordance with the above-described method of manufacture of the second embodiment, differing only in the manner by which the grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140. According to the second embodiment, the grip structure 150 is disposed or trapped between two parts 141, 142 of the body 140. In contrast, in the fourth embodiment, no second part 142 of the body is provided, and the grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140 by way of a snap-fit connection between the grip structure 150 and the body 140, or by way of another suitable connection that still permits the rotation of the grip structure 150 relative to the head 120 and body 140. A fifth embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 6. The fifth embodiment comprises many of the above-described elements of the third embodiment of the present invention, and the like elements are indicated in FIG. 6 with the same reference numerals as used in FIG. 4. In the interests of conciseness, the elements common to the two embodiments will not be described in detail again with reference to FIG. 6. All of the above-described possible variations to the first to fourth embodiments are equally applicable to the fifth embodiment. In the fifth embodiment, the handle 110 no longer has a part equivalent to the body 140. The handle 110 consists of only the grip structure 150, which is rotatably connected to the head 120. The head 120 comprises a sleeve having an interior surface 127 that defines an interior cavity of the sleeve, and a first portion 155 of the grip structure 150 is disposed within the interior cavity of the sleeve. A second portion 157 of the grip structure 150 comprises an exterior surface for holding by a user, which exterior surface forms a portion of the exterior surface 111 of the handle 110. The interior surface 127 of the head 120 and an exterior surface 156 of the first portion 155 of the grip structure 150 are dimensioned so as to permit movement of the grip structure 150 relative to the head 120. That is, a clearance in the form of an annular gap is provided between the interior surface 127 and the exterior surface 156. In the present embodiment, in which both of the interior surface 127 of the head 120 and the exterior surface 156 of the first portion 155 of the grip structure 150 are cylindrical, the diameter of the interior surface 127 is slightly greater than the diameter of the exterior surface 156. The grip structure 150 is connected to the head 120 by way of a snap-fit connection between the grip structure 150 and the head 120, more specifically between a second piece 152 of the grip structure 150 and the head 120. However, in variations to this embodiment, other forms of connection may be used. The grip structure 150 is rotatable relative to the head 120, and thus relative to the cleaning element(s) 130, about the longitudinal axis A-A of the oral care implement 100. The grip structure 150 consists of two pieces 151, 152 connected together. More specifically, the grip structure 150 has a first piece 151 constructed of resilient material, such as a thermoplastic elastomer and/or SEBS, and the second piece 152 constructed of hard or rigid material, in this case a hard plastic, such as polypropylene. The hard or rigid material may alternatively or additionally comprise any of the plastics discussed above. The first piece 151 forms most of the exterior surface of the grip structure 150. In a variation to this embodiment, the first piece 151 may form all of the exterior surface of the grip structure 150. The grip structure 150 is connected to the head 120 by way of the second piece 152 being connected to, or mounted on, the head 120. The first piece 151 is not directly connected to the head 120, but only is connected to the head 120 indirectly via the second piece 152. Since both the head 120 and the second piece 152 of the grip structure 150 are formed of a hard material, the grip structure 150 is able easily to rotate relative to the head 120 with the head 120 and the second piece 152 contacting one another. However, since the first piece 151 is constructed of a resilient material, the grip structure 150 has a comfortable exterior surface for gripping. Preferably, the coefficient of friction of the exterior surface of the first piece 151 is greater than the coefficient of friction of the exterior surface 156 of the second piece 152. In a variation to the illustrated fifth embodiment, the grip structure 150 may consist of only one piece, and may be constructed of any one or more of the materials discussed above for grip structures 150 of the first to fourth embodiments. The oral care implement 100 of the fifth embodiment may be manufactured substantially in accordance with the above-described method of manufacture of the second embodiment, differing only in that the grip structure 150 of the handle 110 is connected to the head 120 rather than to a body of the handle 110. According to the fifth embodiment, the first portion 155 of the grip structure 150 of the handle 110 is disposed within the sleeve of the head 120. More specifically, the oral care implement 100 of the fifth embodiment may be manufactured according to the following steps. First, the head 120 is provided. Then, as a second step, the head 120 is provided with at least one cleaning element 130 that extends from the first surface 124 surface of the head 120. As a third step, the handle 110 is connected to the head 120, the handle 110 comprising the grip structure 150 that forms at least a portion of the exterior surface 111 of the handle 110, the handle 110 being connected to the head 120 so that the grip structure 150 is rotatable relative to the head 120 about the axis A-A, wherein the axis A-A passes through the cleaning element 130 at a point on the cleaning element 130 between the surface 124 of the head 120 and the distal end 131 of the cleaning element 130. In a variation to this method, the third step may be carried out before or at the same time as the second step. In the fifth embodiment, the connection between the head 120 and the handle 110 may be such that the head 120 is connectable and, preferably, then disconnectable from the handle 110, such that the head 120 may be replaced when worn. Indeed, in respective variations to each of the described embodiments, the handle 110 may be connectable to the head 120 and preferably then disconnectable. The present invention may be embodied as a kit of parts for an oral care implement, the kit of parts comprising: one or more heads 120 having a surface 124 from which at least one cleaning element 130 extends, the cleaning element 130 having a distal end 131 furthest from the surface 124 of the head 120; and a handle 110 connectable to the head 120, the handle 110 comprising a grip structure 150 forming at least a portion of an exterior surface 111 of the handle 110; wherein the handle 110 is connectable to the head 120 with the grip structure 150 being rotatable relative to the head 120 about an axis A-A that passes through the cleaning element 130 at a point on the cleaning element 130 between the surface 124 of the head 120 and the distal end 131 of the cleaning element 130. A sixth embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 7. The sixth embodiment comprises many of the above-described elements of the fourth embodiment of the present invention, and the like elements are indicated in FIG. 7 with the same reference numerals as used in FIG. 5. In the interests of conciseness, the elements common to the two embodiments will not be described in detail again with reference to FIG. 7. All of the above-described possible variations to the first to fifth embodiments are equally applicable to the sixth embodiment. In this embodiment, the head 120 is connected to the handle 110 of the implement 100. More specifically, the head 120 is connected to a body 140 of the handle 110. The handle 110 comprises, in addition to the body 140, a grip structure 150, or “grip”, that forms an exterior surface 111 of the handle 110. The grip structure 150 comprises a sleeve having an interior surface 153 that defines an interior cavity of the sleeve. The grip structure 150 and the body 140 are relatively arranged so that a first portion 145 of the body 140 is disposed within the interior cavity of the sleeve. The interior surface 153 of the grip structure 150 and an exterior surface 143 of the first portion 145 of the body 140 are dimensioned so as to permit movement of the grip structure 150 relative to the body 140. That is, a clearance in the form of an annular gap is provided between the interior surface 153 and the exterior surface 143. In the present embodiment, in which both of the interior surface 153 of the grip structure 150 and the exterior surface 143 of the portion of the body 140 are cylindrical, the diameter of the interior surface 153 is slightly greater than the diameter of the exterior surface 143. The grip structure 150 is connected or mounted to the body 140 so as to be rotatable relative to the body 140. Moreover, the grip structure 150 is connected or mounted to the body 140 so as to be rotatable relative to the head 120, and thus relative to the cleaning element(s) 130. The grip structure 150 is rotatable relative to the body 140 and relative to the head 120 about the longitudinal axis A-A of the oral care implement 100. The grip structure 150 comprises first and second sections 152a , 152b , each of which preferably is constructed of one or more hard or rigid materials, such as hard plastic. The hard or rigid material may comprise any one or more of the materials discussed above. Each of the first and second sections 152a , 152b has a respective interior surface 153a , 153b . The grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140 by way of the first portion 145 of the body 140 being sandwiched between the first and second sections 152a , 152b , so that the interior surfaces 153a , 153b of the first and second sections 152a , 152b face the exterior surface 143 of the first portion 145 of the body 140. Together, the interior surfaces 153a , 153b form the interior surface 153 of the grip structure 150. The first and second sections 152a , 152b are joined to each other, by adhesive, welding, or by other means, at a join between the first and second sections 152a , 152b that extends parallel to the longitudinal axis A-A. The exterior surface 143 of the first portion 145 of the body 140 has an annular protrusion 147, with the axis A-A passing through a centre of the annulus. Each of the interior surfaces 153a , 153b includes a recess 154a , 154b taking the shape of a semi-annulus whereby, when first and second sections 152a , 152b are joined to each other with the first portion 145 of the body 140 therebetween, the interior surface 153 of the grip structure 150 has an annular recess 154 that receives the annular protrusion 147. The combination of the annular recess 154 and the annular protrusion 147 creates an interference fit between the body 140 and the grip structure 150, whereby the grip structure 150 is immovable relative to the body 140 in the direction of the axis A-A. In variations to this embodiment, the recess 154 and protrusion 147 may be non-annular. The oral care implement 100 of the sixth embodiment may be manufactured by providing the head 120 and the handle 110, the handle 110 having a body 140 connected to the head 120; providing the head 120 with one or more cleaning elements 130 that extend from a surface 124 of the head 120, the cleaning elements each having a distal end 131 furthest from the surface 124 of the head 120; and connecting the grip structure 150 to the body 140 by sandwiching the first portion 145 of the body 140 between first and second sections 152a , 152b of the grip structure 150 and connecting the first and second sections 152a , 152b to each other. The grip structure 150 is connected to the body 140 so that it forms at least a portion of the exterior surface 111 of the handle 110 and so that it is connected to the body 140 so as to be rotatable relative to the body 140 about the axis A-A that passes through the cleaning elements 130 at a point on some or all of the cleaning elements 130 between the surface 124 of the head 120 and the distal ends 131 of the cleaning elements 130. In other variations to the described embodiments, the head 120 may include various oral surface engaging elements, such as inter-proximal picks, brushes, a flossing element, a plaque scraper, tongue cleansers and soft tissue massagers. In each of the above embodiments, the grip structure 150 is manually rotatable about the longitudinal axis A-A relative to the head 120 (and relative to the body 140, where provided). That is, the rotation of the grip structure 150 is not caused or effectable by any part of the implement 100 itself, so that the rotation of the grip structure 150 must be effected by a user turning the grip structure 150 relative to the head 120 (and body 140 where provided). In respective variations to the described embodiments, the implement 100 may itself comprise a powered rotator, such as a motor, for effecting the rotation of the grip structure 150. The powered rotator may be operable by a user to effect the rotation of the grip structure 150. While the invention has been described with respect to specific examples including presently preferred modes of carrying out the invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous variations and permutations of the above described systems and techniques. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
