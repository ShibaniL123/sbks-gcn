Use of steroids to alleviate inflammation, irritation and itching caused by skin ailments is well known. It is also well known that use of steroids compromises patient's immune system and exposes them to bacterial and fungal infections. Single dose therapies containing steroids, antifungals and antibacterials are well known. Numerous single dose treatments, both topical and systemic, are currently employed for the treatment of above skin inflammations. Topical and systemic inflammatory treatment compositions typically employ a combination of corticosteroids in a base component. "1 he active ingredients typically comprise Corticosteroids such as Betamelhasone Valerate, Fluticasone Propionate. Mometasone Furoate, Dexamethasone Acetate, Hydrocortisone Acetate, Clobetasol Propionate, Beclomethasone Dipropionate, Betamethasone Dipropionate and the like. Fungal infections sometimes follow the use of antibiotics, which kill nonpathogenic as well as pathogenic bacteria, thereby providing a free field in the body for fungal invasion. Numerous treatments both topical and systemic are currently employed for the treatment of fungal infections. Topical and systemic fungal infections, treatment compositions typically employ antilungal agents as active ingredients in a base component. The active ingredients typically comprise antifungal agents such as Miconazole Nitrate, Terbinafine Hydrochloride, Ketoconazole, Clotrimazole and the like. Numerous treatments, both topical and systemic, are available for the primary and secondary skin infection caused by sensitive Gram +ve organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococctm spp etc. Topical and systemic bacterial infection treatment compositions typically employ at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient (AP|) in combination with a base component. In the cream form, the APls typically comprise an antibiotic/antibacterial such as Fusidic acid and the like. In the currently available Fusidic acid creams, Fusidic acid in fine powder form is used as source API. The small particle size enhances its dermal contact by providing a large specific surface area and penetration, and provides a smooth feel on application to skin. However, a serious shortcoming of the fine size of Fusidic acid particles is that it presents an enormous surface area for contact and reaction with molecular Oxygen during manufacture, handling, and processing of the cream. This has serious implications to its chemical stability and results in rapid reduction in potency of the API (Fu idic acid) in the final cream formulation. Degradation due to oxidation is a major cause of instability of currently available Fusidic acid creams. Table 1 show that the degradation in the API samples (Fusidic acid) exposed to oxygen ranged between 7.7% and 11% for conditions ranging from room temperature to 45 °C when analysed at three months of exposure period at the above conditions. It is known that greater the exposure time of Fusidic acid as the raw API to Oxygen, greater the limitations on stabilising Fusidic acid in a formulation. However, there is no published data on the stability of Fusidic acid over a period of time. As an alternative to Fusidic acid, Stadium Fusidate is known to have been used to make dermaceutical medicaments I\)r topical application. However, these are in the form of ointment rather than cream. Drawbacks of ointments over creams are well known and it's generally preferable to use creams rather than ointments for topical application. Several aspects of Fusidic acid as aul API are known: • It is thermolabile • It is available in cream formulations • It can be obtained from Sodium l usidate by dissolving the latter in an aqueous phase and adding acid to the solution, whereby Fusidic acid precipitates. However, the Fusidic acid precipitate is difficult to process into a cream form first due to its coarse and uneven particle size and second retrieving Fusidic acid from wet cake involves drying and further handling which deteriorates the Fusidic acid due to exposure to oxygen • The stability of the API in a Fusidic acid cream is unreliable due to the thermolabile nature of Fusidic a id Stabilization of medicaments containing Fusidic acid against oxidation involves observing a number of stringent precautionary procedures during manufacture and storage. These include: • replacing Oxygen in pharmaceutical containers with inert gases such as Nitrogen, Carbon dioxide, Helium and the like • avoiding contact of the medicament with heavy metal ions which catalyze oxidation, • storing the API at reduced temperatures throughout its shelf life before processing In practice this means stricter controls during the manufacture as well as storage of such API (storing it typically a 2°C to 8°C in air-tight containers throughout their shelf life), There is therefore a need to provide a Fusidic acid cream in which Fusidic acid will be of greater stability at the time of the manufacture of the cream, and which will sustain its stability at an acceptable level throughout its shelf life. ]'here's a need to provide dermaceutical cream containing Mometasone furoate as a steroid, clotrimazole as an antifungal, and an antibacterial in the form of Fusidic acid, and in which Fusidic acid will be of greater stability at the time of the manufacture of the cream, and which will sustain its stability at an acceptable level throughout its shelf life. Objects And Advantages Of The Invention II is therefore one object of the present invention to provide a cream which contains Fusidic acid as the active AI I but which has greater stability of the API throughout its shelf life. It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a dermaceutical cream containing at least one steroid, and an antibacteriz, I agent in the form of Fusidic acid, in which Fusidic acid will be of greater stability at the time of the manufacture of the cream, and which will sustaii 1 its stability at an acceptable level throughout its shelf life. Brief Summary Of The Invention The invention discloses a dermaceulical cream containing Fluticasone Propionate as a corticosteroid, an antifungal agent in the form of Clotrimazole and an antibacterial agent in the form of Fusidic acid, which Fusidic acid is formed in situ from Sodium Fusidate as the starting raw material, wherein Sodium Fusidate is converted into Fusidic acid under oxygen-free environment. ]'he cream of the present invention has greater shelf-life stability and the finer particle size of the AP1 than the conventional creams containing Fusidic acid. The cream of the present invention contains Fusidic acid as the API that has been for 1 ned in situ from Sodium Fusidate, Fluticasone I'ropionate and Clotrimazole, in a cream base comprising a preservative, an acid, a co-solvent, einulsifiers and a waxy material along with water, preferably purified water. Detailed Description Of The Invention We discussed earlier the known aspects of the topical preparations that have Fusidic acid and Sodium Fusidate as the APIs. It is evident from the current state of knowledge that: Creams containing Fusidic acid that are made using Sodium Fusidate as starting AP] are not available. Creams containing Fusidic acid that are made using Sodium Fusidate along with a corticosteroid in the form of Fluticasone Propionate as starting APls are not available. Creams containing Fusidic acid that are made using Sodium Fusidate along with corticosteroid i the form of Fluticasone Propionate and Clotrimazole as antifungal agent are also not available. There is no published data on the stability of Sodium Fusidate as the API. Sodium Fusidate is not considered to be inherently more stable as an API than Fusidic acid. In the face of this, it has been surprisingly discovered that Sodium Fusidate as an API is significantly more stable than Fusidic acid and that Fusidic acid deteriorates more rapidly than Sodiu,n Fusidate. There is no published data on the stability of Sodium Fusidate as the API. The applicant carried out experiments on Sodium Fusidate to evaluate its stability. It can be seen from Table 2 that the degradation of Sodium Fusidate over a temperature range of room temperature to 45 °C ranged between 2.45 % and 6%. Tables 1 and 2 also show the comparison between the stability of the Fusidic acid and Sodium Fusidate as raw APIs. The study was carried out using an in-house HPLC method developed by the applicant, which the applicant believes is a true stability-indicating method as opposed to the titration method suggested in British Pharmacopoeia (BP). This is because the BP method does not differentiate between the intact API and the degraded form.

It can be observed from Tables 1 and 2 that: • In the case of Fusidic Acid, there is about 7.7% loss in 3 Months at room temperature (open condition) and about I I% loss in 3 Months at 45°C (open condition). • In the case of Sodium Fusida e, there is about 2.5% loss in 3 Months at room temperature (open condition) and about 6% loss in 3 Months at 45°C (open condition). The data thus shows that Sodium Fuqdate as an API is more stable than Fusidic acid. The applicant explored the possibility of making a cream (rather than an ointment) using Sodium Fusidate (rather than Fusidic acid) and a corticosteroid in the form of such as Fluticasone Propionate. Although Sodium Fusidate has been used in dermaceutical applications, it has not been possible to make creams that use Sodium Fusidate. This is because f the inherent alkalinity of Sodium Fusidate (pH 7.5 to 9), which means it cannot be used in a cream form therefore all products manufactured using Sodium Fusidate as starting material are ointments. A dermaceutical cream that uses Stadium Fusidate and steroids would exploit the benefit of the fact that Sodium Fusidate is more stable than Fusidic acid and it would also provide a cream formulation which is far superior in its application qualities than an ointment. It would thus fill an existing need for a cream that has better stability than currently aw ilable creams containing Fusidic acid and steroids. The applicant therefore surprisingly discovered that in order to achieve greater stability of the API in a dermaceutical cream, Sodium Fusidate rather than Fusidic acid may be used as the starting API during the cream's manufacture. Using Sodium Fusidate as starting material eliminates the drawback associated with the manufacture and storage of existing Fusidic acid creams. The applicant has also discovered that the Fusidic acid and steroids cream prepared using Sodium Fusidate as the starting APls showed good chemical stability, and efficacy. The application discloses a cream containing Steroids in the form of Fluticasone Propionate and Fusidic acid (the \PI) that has been prepared using Sodium Fusidate as the starting API, in which Fusidic acid forms in-situ under totally oxygen free environment by slow addition of an acid, into a molecular dispersion form (due to the presence of a co-solvent) at the intermediate stage, and which Fusidic acid regenerates as an extremely fine dispersion when added to a final cream base, thereby resulting in a finely and homogeneously dispersed I:usidic acid in the final cream. All these operations are performed in an environment free of atmospheric oxygen. 1"he cream of the present invention contains Fusidic acid as the API that has been formed in situ from Sodium Fusidate, a steroid in the form of Fluticasone Propionate in a cream base comwising an acid, a preservative, a co-solvent, emulsifiers and a waxy material along with water, preferably purified water, The cream base of the present invention optionally further comprises an ingredient selected from a group comprising a buffering agent, an anti oxidant, a chelating agent, and a humectant, or any combination thereof. The present invention provides a novel cream that has been produced using Sodium Fusidate as the starting raw material, and which cream contains Fusidic acid of high therapeutic efficacy and of chemical stability that is generally superior to the commercially available creams containing Fusidic acid. The Fusidic acid and steroid cream of the present invention has been manufactured in a totally oxygen free environment under purging with inert gas and applying vacuum. Under these conditions, the Sodium Fusidate is converted in situ into Fusidic acid. The cream of the present invention is used in the treatment of bacterial skin infections and inflammations. The pH of the product of the present invention is between 3 and 6. On the other hand, Sodium Fusidate ointments that are commercially available are greasy and cosmetically non elegant. It is essential that the active drug penetrates the skin for the optimum bio-dermal efficacy. The particle size of the active drug plays an important role here. It is necessary that the active drug is available in a finely dispersed form for the product to be being efficacious. ,\lso this is to be achieved in the safe pH compatible environment of skin (4.0 to 6.0). To achieve all these, it is essential to choose proper vehicles or co-solvents for the dissolution or dispersion of the drug. The product of the present invention is efficacious due to the pronounced antiinflammatory, antibacterial activity of the steroid and regenerated Fusidic acid which is available in reduced particle size than the conventional products, and in a finely dispersed form. The inventor has screened different co-solvents such as Propylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, PolyEthyleneGlycol-400 & the like and dissolved the Sodium Fusidate in one of above co-solvents varying between 5% (w/w) to 40% (w/w) under inert gas purging and under w cuum and converted to Fusidic acid in-situ by adding an acid such as HCI, H 2 5() 4 , HNO 3 , Lactic acid and the like between 0.005% (w/w) and about 0.5% (w/w) under stirring and obtained Fusidic acid in more stabilized and solution form, which makes our final product in a cream base which easily penetrates the skin and highly efficacious, and also highly derma compatible by having a pH ofaboul 3.0 to about 6.0. The present invention discloses the Iollowing embodiments.
