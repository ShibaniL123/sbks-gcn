EXAMPLE 8
5-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme 1, compound 8)
Similarly to example 1.8, starting from 245 mg (1.6 mmol) of 3,4-difluorophenylboronic acid and 150 mg (0.3 mmol) of 5-bromo-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (prepared as described in example 2.5). After crystallization in a heptane/ethyl acetate 70/30 mixture, filtration and drying under vacuum for 24 hours, 40 mg (25%) of 5-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a beige solid with a melting point of 153Â° C.
