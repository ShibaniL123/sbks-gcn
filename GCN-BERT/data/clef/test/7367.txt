TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a nematic liquid crystal composition having a positive dielectric anisotropy (Δ∈) useful as a liquid crystal display material, and to a liquid crystal display device using such a composition. BACKGROUND ART Liquid crystal display devices are increasingly used in watches, calculators, various measurement instruments, automobile panels, word processors, electronic organizers, printers, computers, televisions, clocks, advertising boards, etc. Representative examples of the liquid crystal display mode include twisted nematic (TN) mode, super twisted nematic (STN) mode, and vertical alignment mode or in-plane-switching (IPS) mode that uses thin film transistors (TFTs). Liquid crystal compositions used in such liquid crystal display devices are required to be stable against external stimuli such as water, air, heat, and light, be in a liquid crystal phase in a temperature range as wide as possible around room temperature, have low viscosity, and operate at low drive voltage. A liquid crystal composition is constituted by several to several dozens of compounds in order to optimize dielectric anisotropy (Δ∈) and/or refractive index anisotropy (Δn) and the like for each individual display device. A vertical alignment (VA) mode display uses a liquid crystal composition having negative Δ∈ whereas a horizontal alignment mode display, such as TN, STN, or in-plane-switching (IPS) mode display, uses a liquid crystal composition having positive Δ∈. Also reported is a drive mode by which a liquid crystal composition having positive Δ∈ is aligned vertically in the absence of applied voltage and driven by applying a horizontal electric field to perform display. The demand for liquid crystal compositions having positive Δ∈ is increasing. Meanwhile, low-voltage driving, high-speed response, and a wide operation temperature range are desirable in all drive modes. In other words, Δ∈ is required to be positive and have a large absolute value, the viscosity (η) is required to be small, and the nematic phase-isotropic liquid phase transition temperature (Tni) is required to be high. There is also a need to adjust the Δn of the liquid crystal composition in accordance with a cell gap so that the setting of Δn×d, which is the product of Δn and a cell gap (d), is met. Furthermore, high-speed response is important in using a liquid crystal display device in a television or the like. Thus, a liquid crystal composition having a low rotational viscosity (γ1) is required for this use. An example of a high-response-speed-oriented liquid crystal composition has been disclosed which contains a liquid crystal compound having positive Δ∈ represented by formula (A-1) or (A-2) used in combination with a liquid crystal compound (B) having neutral Δ∈. It is well known in the field of liquid crystal compositions that the feature of these liquid crystal compositions is that the liquid crystal compound having positive Δ∈ has a —CF2O— structure and that the liquid crystal compound having neutral Δ∈ has an alkenyl group (PTL 1 to PTL 4). Expansion of applications of liquid crystal display devices has caused great changes in the way these devices are manufactured and used. In order to meet these changes, optimization of characteristics other than basic physical property values previously considered has become necessary. Namely, VA and IPS mode liquid crystal display devices that use liquid crystal compositions have become widespread, and supersize display devices 50 or greater have become commercially viable and used. With the increase in substrate size, the mainstream injection method for injecting a liquid crystal composition into a substrate has shifted from a vacuum injection method to a one-drop-fill method (ODF); however, this leads to a problem of degradation of display quality caused by drop marks that occur at the time the liquid crystal composition is dropped onto the substrate. Moreover, in a liquid crystal display device production process that employs the ODF method, optimum amounts of liquid crystals need to be dropped in accordance with the size of the liquid crystal display device. Once the injection amount increases from the optimum value, the previously designed balance between the refractive index of the liquid crystal display device and the driving electric field is lost and display defects such as generation of nonuniformity and contrast failures result. In particular, the optimum liquid crystal injection amount for small-size liquid crystal display devices frequently used in latest smart phones is small and it is difficult to control the deviation from the optimum value within a particular range. Accordingly, in order to keep the yield of liquid crystal display devices high, for example, a liquid crystal composition is required to be less susceptible to impacts and rapid pressure changes inside the dropping machine during dropping of liquid crystals and to have properties that allow liquid crystals to be dropped stably over a long period of time. As described above, a liquid crystal composition for use in an active matrix-driving liquid crystal display device driven by TFTs and the like is required to maintain those properties and performance, such as high-speed response, required by liquid crystal display devices, exhibit high resistivity, high voltage holding ratio, and stability under external stimuli such as light and heat which have been previously considered important, and be developed by considering the liquid crystal display device production method.

The content thereof is preferably 0.001 to 1% by mass, more preferably 0.001 to 0.1% by mass, and most preferably 0.001 to 0.05% by mass. The liquid crystal composition of the present invention containing polymerizable compounds gains a liquid crystal aligning ability when the polymerizable compounds are polymerized by ultraviolet irradiation and is used in a liquid crystal display device in which the amount of transmitted light is controlled by utilizing birefringence of the liquid crystal composition. The liquid crystal composition is useful for liquid crystal display devices such as AM-LCD (active matrix liquid crystal display device), TN (nematic liquid crystal display device), STN-LCD (super twisted nematic liquid crystal display device), OCB-LCD, and IPS-LCD (in-plane switching liquid crystal display device), and is particularly useful for AM-LCD. The liquid crystal composition can be used in transmissive or reflective liquid crystal display devices. The two substrates of a liquid crystal cell used in a liquid crystal display device can be composed of a flexible transparent material such as glass or plastic and one of them can be composed of an opaque material such as silicon. A transparent substrate having a transparent electrode layer can be obtained by, for example, sputter-depositing indium tin oxide (ITO) on a transparent substrate such as a glass plate. A color filter can be manufactured by, for example, a pigment dispersion method, a printing method, an electrodeposition method, or a dyeing method. Preparation of a color filter by a pigment dispersion method is described here as an example. A curable color composition for a color filter is applied to the transparent substrate, patterning is performed, and the composition is cured by heating or irradiation with light. This process is performed for each of three colors, red, green and blue, and pixel portions of a color filter are formed as a result. Pixel electrodes including active elements such as TFTs, thin film diodes, and metal-insulator-metal resistive elements may be installed on the substrate. The substrates are arranged to oppose each other with the transparent electrode layer facing inward. During this process, the gap between the substrates may be adjusted by using spacers. In such a case, the gap is preferably adjusted so that the thickness of alight adjusting layer to be obtained is 1 to 100 μm and more preferably 1.5 to 10 μm. In the case where a polarizer is used, the product of the cell thickness d and the refractive index anisotropy Δn of the liquid crystal is preferably adjusted to maximize contrast. In the case where two polarizers are used, the polarization axis of each polarizer can be adjusted to improve viewing angle and contrast. A retardation film for expanding the viewing angle can also be used. Examples of the spacers include glass particles, plastic particles, alumina particles, and columnar spacers composed of photoresist materials and the like. Then a sealing material such as an epoxy-based thermosetting composition is screen-printed onto the substrate while securing a liquid crystal injection port, the substrates are bonded to each other, and heating is performed to thermally cure the sealing material. For example, a common vacuum injection method or ODF method can be used to place a polymerizable-compound-containing liquid crystal composition in a gap between the two substrates. However, the vacuum injection method has a problem in that, although drop marks do not occur, trace of injection remains. The invention of the subject application is more suitable for use in making a display device by an ODF method. In a liquid crystal display device manufacturing process by an ODF method, a sealing material such as an epoxy-based photothermal dual curing sealing material is applied to one of a backplane substrate or a frontplane substrate by using a dispenser so as to form a closed-loop bank, a particular amount of the liquid crystal composition is placed dropwise in the space defined by the bank while performing evacuation, and the frontplane and the backplane are bonded to each other to manufacture a liquid crystal display device. The liquid crystal composition of the present invention is favorable since dropping of the liquid crystal composition during the ODF step can be performed stably. In order to a satisfactorily align the liquid crystal, an appropriate polymerization speed is desirable. Thus, the method for polymerizing the polymerizable compounds is preferably involves irradiating the liquid crystal composition with an active energy ray such as an ultraviolet ray or an electron beam or with two or more active energy rays either simultaneously or sequentially. In the case where ultraviolet rays are used, a polarized light source may be used or unpolarized light source may be used. In the case where polymerization is performed while holding the polymerizable-compound-containing liquid crystal composition between the two substrates, at least the substrate on the incident side must have an appropriate degree of transparency for the active energy ray used. Moreover, after only a particular portion is polymerized by using a mask during irradiation, the alignment state of the unpolymerized portion may be changed by changing the conditions such as electric field, magnetic field, or temperature and then an active energy ray may be applied again to perform polymerization. In particular, when the liquid crystal composition is exposed with an UV ray, UV exposure is preferably performed while applying an AC electric field to the polymerizable-compound-containing liquid crystal composition. The AC electric field applied is preferably an AC having a frequency of 10 Hz to 10 kHz and more preferably an AC having a frequency of 60 Hz to 10 kHz, and the voltage is selected depending on the desired pretilt angle of the liquid crystal display device. In other words, the pretilt angle of the liquid crystal display device can be controlled by the applied voltage. For a horizontal electric field-type MVA-mode liquid crystal display device, the pretilt angle is preferably controlled to 80° to 89.9° from the viewpoints of alignment stability and contrast. The temperature during irradiation is preferably within a temperature range in which the liquid crystal composition of the present invention retains a liquid crystal state. Polymerization is preferably conducted at a temperature near room temperature, that is, typically a temperature in a range of 15 to 35° C. The lamp that generates UV rays may be a metal halide lamp, a high-pressure mercury lamp, an ultra-high-pressure mercury lamp, or the like. The wavelength of the UV ray applied is preferably in the wavelength region outside the absorption wavelength region of the liquid crystal composition and, if needed, some portions of the UV rays may be cut. The intensity of the ultraviolet ray applied is preferably 0.1 mW/cm2 to 100 W/cm2 and more preferably 2 mW/cm2 to 50 W/cm2. The amount of energy of the ultraviolet ray applied can be appropriately adjusted but is preferably 10 mJ/cm2 to 500 J/cm2 and more preferably 100 mJ/cm2 to 200 J/cm2. The intensity may be varied during irradiation with UV rays. The amount of time for which the UV ray is applied is appropriately selected depending on the intensity of the UV ray applied but is preferably 10 to 3600 seconds and more preferably 10 to 600 seconds. A liquid crystal display device that uses the liquid crystal composition of the present invention is useful since it exhibits high-speed response and suppresses display failures and is particularly useful in active matrix-driving liquid crystal display devices and liquid crystal display devices of VA mode, PSVA mode, PSA mode, IPS mode, and ECB mode. Preferred embodiments of a liquid crystal display according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a liquid crystal display device that includes two substrates opposing each other, a sealing material disposed between the substrates, and a liquid crystal sealed inside the sealed region surrounded by the sealing material. Specifically, the drawing shows a specific embodiment of a liquid crystal display device that includes a backplane constituted by a TFT layer 102 and a pixel electrode 103 disposed on a substrate a 100 and a passivation film 104 and an alignment film a 105 disposed on the TFT layer 102 and the pixel electrode 103; a frontplane constituted by a black matrix 202, color filters 203, a planarizing film (overcoat layer) 201, and a transparent electrode 204 disposed on a substrate b 200, and an alignment film b 205 disposed on the transparent electrode 204, the frontplane opposing the backplane; a sealing material 301 disposed between the substrates; and a liquid crystal layer 303 sealed inside a sealed region surrounded by the sealing material. Projections 304 are disposed on the substrate surface in contact with the sealing material 301. The substrate a and the substrate b may be composed of any material that is substantially transparent and glass, ceramics, plastics, etc., can be used. For a plastic substrate, cellulose, cellulose derivatives such as triacetyl cellulose and diacetyl cellulose, polycycloolefin derivatives, polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate, polyolefins such as polypropylene and polyethylene, polycarbonate, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyamide, polyimide, polyimide amide, polystyrene, polyacrylate, polymethyl methacrylate, polyether sulfone, polyarylate, and inorganic-organic composite materials such as glass fiber-epoxy resin and glass fiber-acryl resin can be used. In the case where a plastic substrate is used, a barrier film is preferably provided. The function of the barrier film is to decrease the moisture permeability of the plastic substrate and improve reliability of the electric properties of the liquid crystal display device. The barrier film is not particularly limited as long as the film has high transparency and low water vapor permeability. Typically, a thin film formed by using an inorganic material such as silicon oxide through vapor deposition, sputtering, or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is used. In the present invention, the same material or different materials may be used in the substrate a and the substrate b. Glass substrates are preferable since a liquid crystal display device having good heat resistance and dimensional stability can be fabricated. Plastic substrates are also preferable since they are suitable for a roll-to-roll production method, light-weight, and flexible. If flatness and heat resistance are desirable, a plastic substrate and a glass substrate are preferably used in combination since preferable results can be yielded. In Examples described below, substrates are used as the materials for the substrate a 100 and the substrate b 200. In the backplane, the TFT layer 102 and the pixel electrode 103 are disposed on the substrate a 100. The TFT layer 102 and the pixel electrode 103 are produced in a typical array process. The passivation film 104 and the alignment film a 105 are formed thereon and a backplane is obtained as a result. The passivation film 104 (also referred to as an inorganic protective film) is a film for protecting the TFT layer and is typically formed as a nitride film (SiNx), an oxide film (SiOx), or the like by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The alignment film a 105 has a function of aligning the liquid crystal and a polymer material such as polyimide is typically frequently used. An alignment agent solution composed of a polymer material and a solvent is used as the coating solution. The alignment film has a possibility of inhibiting adhesive force to the sealing material and is thus patterned and applied in the sealed region. A printing method such as flexo printing or a droplet ejection method such as ink jet is employed for application. After the solvent has evaporated by precuring, the applied alignment agent solution is crosslinked and cured by baking. Subsequently, an aligning process is performed to yield an aligning function. The aligning process is usually performed by a rubbing technique. The polymer film formed as mentioned above is rubbed in one direction with a rubbing cloth composed of fibers such as rayon so as to yield a liquid crystal aligning ability. Alternatively, an optical alignment technique is sometimes employed. The optical alignment technique is a technique of generating the aligning property by irradiation of an alignment film containing a photosensitive organic material with polarized light. According to this technique, scratching of the substrate and generation of dust that occur in the rubbing technique do not occur. Examples of the organic material used in the optical alignment technique include materials that contain dichroic dyes. Examples of the dichroic dyes that can be used include those which have groups (hereinafter simply referred to as optical alignment groups) that induce an optical reaction from which the liquid crystal alignment property originates, such as induction of molecular alignment or isomerization reaction (ex. azobenzene group) caused by Weigert's effect caused by dichroism, dimerization reaction (ex. cinnamoyl group), optical crosslinking reaction (ex. benzophenone group), or optical decomposition reaction (ex. polyimide group). The applied aligning agent solution is precured to evaporate the solvent and then irradiated with light (polarized light) having a desired polarization so as to obtain an alignment film having an aligning property in the desired direction. The frontplane is constituted by the black matrix 202, the color filter 203, the planarizing film 201, the transparent electrode 204, and the alignment film b 205 disposed on the substrate b 200. The black matrix 202 is, for example, fabricated by a pigment dispersion method. In particular, a color resin solution containing an evenly dispersed black colorant for forming a black matrix is applied to the substrate b 200 having the barrier film 201 formed thereon so as to form a coloring layer. The coloring layer is then cured by baking. A photoresist is applied to the coloring layer and prebaked. The photoresist is exposed through a mask pattern and developed to perform patterning on the coloring layer. Then the photoresist layer is removed and the coloring layer is baked to form a black matrix 202. Alternatively, a photoresist-type pigment dispersion may be used. In such a case, a photoresist-type pigment dispersion is applied, prebaked, exposed through a mask pattern, and developed to conduct patterning on the coloring layer. Then the photoresist layer is removed and the coloring layer is baked to form a black matrix 202. The color filter 203 is prepared by a pigment dispersion method, an electrodeposition method, a printing method, or a dyeing method. For example, according to a pigment dispersion method, a color resin solution in which a pigment (for example, a red pigment) is evenly dispersed is applied to the substrate b 200 and cured by baking. Then a photoresist is applied thereto and prebaked. The photoresist is exposed through a mask pattern and then developed to perform patterning. The photoresist layer is then removed and baking is performed again. As a result, a (red) color filter 203 is obtained. The order of color in which the filters are made is not particularly limited. A green color filter 203 and a blue color filter 203 are made in the same manner. The transparent electrode 204 is formed on the color filter 203 (if needed, an overcoat layer (201) for planarizing the surface is formed on the color filter 203). The transmittance of the transparent electrode 204 is preferably high and the electrical resistance of the transparent electrode 204 is preferably low. The transparent electrode 204 is formed by sputter-deposition or the like of an oxide film such as ITO. A passivation film is formed on the transparent electrode 204 to protect the transparent electrode 204 in some cases. The alignment film b 205 is the same as the alignment film a 105. While specific embodiments of the backplane and the frontplane used in the present invention are described above, the subject application is not limited to these specific embodiments and these embodiments may be freely altered depending on the desired liquid crystal display device. The shape of the columnar spacers is not particularly limited and its horizontal cross section may have a variety of shapes such as circular, rectangular, and polygonal shapes. Considering the misalignment margin during the process, the horizontal cross section is particularly preferably circular or regular polygonal in shape. The shape of the projections is preferably a truncated cone or truncated pyramid. The material of the columnar spacers is not particularly limited as long as it is a material that does not dissolve in the sealing material, the organic solvent used in the sealing material, or the liquid crystals. From the viewpoints of processing and weight reduction, a synthetic resin (curable resin) is preferable. The projections can be formed by a photolithographic method or a droplet ejection method on the surface of the first substrate that comes into contact with the sealing material. Due to these reasons, it is preferable to use a photocurable resin suitable for photolithography or a droplet ejection method. The case in which the columnar spacers are obtained by a photolithographic method is described below as an example. A resin solution for forming columnar spacers (not containing colorants) is applied to the transparent electrode 204 of the frontplane. Then this resin layer is cured by baking. A photoresist is applied thereto and prebaked. After exposing the photoresist through a mask pattern, development is conducted to conduct patterning of the resin layer. The photoresist layer is then removed and the resin layer is baked so as to complete formation of the columnar spacers. The positions of forming the columnar spacers can be determined as desired by using a mask pattern. Accordingly, the columnar spacers can be formed inside the sealed region and outside the sealed region (portion where the sealing material is applied) of the liquid crystal display device simultaneously. The columnar spacers are preferably formed to be positioned on the black matrix so as not to degrade quality of the sealed region. The columnar spacers fabricated by a photolithographic method as such are sometimes called column spacers or photo spacers. A mixture containing a triazole-based initiator, an acrylic acid copolymer, a polyfunctional acryl-based monomer or a negative-type water-soluble resin such as PVA-stilbazo photosensitive resin, etc., is used as the material for the spacers. Alternatively, a method that uses a color resin in which a colorant is dispersed in a polyimide resin is available. In the present invention, the spacers can be obtained without any limitation by using a known material in accordance with the compatibility with the liquid crystals and the sealing material used. After the columnar spacers are formed as such on the surface of the frontplane where a sealed region is to be formed, a sealing material (301 in FIG. 1) is applied to the surface that will make contact with the sealing material of the backplane. The material for the sealing material is not particularly limited, and a curable resin composition containing a polymerization initiator and an epoxy-based or acryl-based photocurable, thermally curable, or photothermal dual curing resin is used. In order to control the moisture permeability, elastic modulus, viscosity, and the like, a filler composed of an inorganic material or an organic material is sometimes added. The shape of the filler is not particularly limited and may be spherical, fibrous, or irregular. A spherical gap material that has a monodisperse diameter or a fibrous gap material may be mixed in order to a satisfactorily control the cell gap or a fibrous substance that easily becomes entangled with the projections on the substrate can be added in order to further increase the adhesive force to the substrate. The diameter of the fibrous substance used here is preferably about ⅕ to 1/10 of the cell gap or less. The length of the fibrous substance is preferably smaller than the width of the applied seal. The material of the fibrous substance is not particularly limited as long as a particular shape can be obtained. A synthetic fiber such as cellulose, polyamide, or polyester, or an inorganic material such as glass or carbon can be appropriately selected. A printing method and a dispensing method are available as the method for applying the sealing material. A dispensing method that uses less sealing material is preferable. The positions where the sealing material is applied are usually on a black matrix in order not to adversely affect the sealed region. In order to form a liquid crystal dropping region in the next step (in order to prevent leakage of the liquid crystals), the shape of the applied sealing material is to be a closed loop shape. Liquid crystals are dropped in the closed loop (sealed region) of the frontplane to which the sealing material has been applied. Typically, a dispenser is used. The amount of liquid crystals to be dropped is basically equal to the volume obtained by multiplying the area of the applied seal and the height of the columnar spacer in order for the amount of the liquid crystals dropped to be equal to the cell volume. However, to deal with liquid crystal leakage that occurs in the cell bonding step and optimize the display properties, the amount of the liquid crystals to be dropped may be appropriately adjusted or the positions where the liquid crystals are to be dropped may be scattered. Next, the frontplane onto which the sealing material has been applied and the liquid crystals have been dropped is bonded to the backplane. In particular, the frontplane and the backplane are adsorbed to stages having a substrate adsorbing mechanism such as an electrostatic chuck and are arranged in such a manner that the alignment film b of the frontplane and the alignment film a of the backplane face each other and in such a position (distance) that the sealing material does not contact the other substrate. Under such conditions, the interior of the system is evacuated. Upon completion of evacuation, the positions of the two substrates are adjusted (alignment operation) while monitoring the position where the frontplane and the backplane are to be bonded to each other. After adjustment of the bonding position is finished, the substrates are brought to be close to each other up to a position where the sealing material on the frontplane contacts the backplane. Under these conditions, the interior of the system is filled with inert gas and the pressure is slowly returned to normal while releasing the evacuation. Due to this process, the frontplane and the backplane become bonded to each other due to atmospheric pressure, and a cell gap is formed at a height position of the columnar spacers. Under these conditions, the sealing material is irradiated with an ultraviolet ray to be cured and form a liquid crystal cell. Subsequently, a heating step is performed in some cases so as to accelerate curing of the sealing material. A heating step is frequently added so as to increase the adhesive force of the sealing material and improve the reliability of electrical properties.

positive dielectric anisotropy according to the present invention has good low-temperature solubility and undergoes significantly small changes in resistance and voltage holding ratio under heat and/or light. Thus, the product has high utility and a liquid crystal display device that contains the liquid crystal composition can achieve high-speed response. Since dropping of the liquid crystal composition can be continued stably during a liquid crystal display device production process, display failures caused by the process are suppressed and high-yield production is achieved. Thus, the liquid crystal composition is extremely useful.
