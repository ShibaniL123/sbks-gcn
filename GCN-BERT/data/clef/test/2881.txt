TITLE PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF 1 ,1 ,1 ,2,2-PENTAFLUORO- 3-CHLOROPROPANE BACKGROUND INFORMATION Field of the Disclosure This disclosure relates in general to processes for the production of fluorinated olefins such as 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene, and fluorocarbons which can be readily converted into such fluorinated olefins. Description of the Related Art The fluorocarbon industry has been working for the past few decades to find replacement refrigerants for the ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) being phased out as a result of the Montreal Protocol. The solution for many applications has been the commercialization of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) compounds for use as refrigerants, solvents, fire extinguishing agents, blowing agents and propellants. These new compounds, such as HFC refrigerants, HFC-134a and HFC-125 being the most widely used at this time, have zero ozone depletion potential and thus are not affected by the current regulatory phase-out as a result of the Montreal Protocol. In addition to ozone depleting concerns, global warming is another environmental concern in many of these applications. Thus, there is a need for compositions that meet both low ozone depletion standards as well as having low global warming potentials. Certain hydrofluoroolefins are believed to meet both goals. Thus there is a need for manufacturing processes that provide halogenated hydrocarbons and fluoroolefins that contain no chlorine that also have a low global warming potential. There is also considerable interest in developing new refrigerants with reduced global warming potential for the mobile air-conditioning market. HFC-1234yf (CF3CF=CH2) and HFC-1234ze (CF3CH=CHF) , both having zero ozone depletion and low global warming potential, have been identified as potential refrigerants. U. S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0106263 A1 discloses the production of HFC-1234yf by a catalytic vapor phase dehydrofluorination of CF3CF2CH3 or CF3CHFCH2F, and of HFC-1234ze (mixture of E- and Z- isomers) by a catalytic vapor phase dehydrofluorination of CF3CH2CHF2. There is a continuing need for more selective and efficient manufacturing processes for the production of HFC-1234yf. SUMMARY The present invention provides a process for making CH2CICF2CF5 (HCFC-235cb). The process comprises reacting CH2CIF (HCFC-31 ) with CF2=CF2 (TFE) in a reaction zone in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of an aluminum halide composition having a bulk formula of AICIxBryF3-x-y wherein the average value of x is 0 to 3, the average value of y is 0 to 3-x, provided that the average values of x and y are not both 0 with a selectivity to HCFC-235cb of at least 70%. The foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as defined in the appended claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION In one embodiment, the present invention provides a process for making CH2CICF2CF5 (HCFC-235cb). The process comprises reacting CH2CIF (HCFC-31 ) with CF2=CF2 (TFE) in a reaction zone in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of an aluminum halide composition having a bulk formula of AICIxBryF3-x-y wherein the average value of x is 0 to 3, the average value of y is 0 to 3-x, provided that the average values of x and y are not both 0 with a selectivity to HCFC-235cb of at least 70%. In another embodiment, the selectivity to HCFC-235cb is at least 80%. In yet another embodiment, the process is conducted at a temperature of from 25°C to 40°C Many aspects and embodiments have been described above and are merely exemplary and not limiting. After reading this specification, skilled artisans appreciate that other aspects and embodiments are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. Other features and benefits of any one or more of the embodiments will be apparent from the following detailed description, and from the claims. The present invention provides a process for making HCFC-235cb. The process comprises reacting HCFC-31 with TFE in a reaction zone in the presence of an aluminum halide composition having a bulk formula of AICIxBryF3-x-y wherein the average value of x is 0 to 3, the average value of y is 0 to 3-x, provided that the average values of x and y are not both 0. It has been found in accordance with this invention that the HCFC-235cb can be produced with high selectivity of at least 70%, as calculated as a percentage of the amount of HCFC-235cb as compared to the total amount of C3 products, including other isomers of HCFC-235, HCFC- 236cb, and any isomers of HCFC-225, any of which may be produced as by-products. In another embodiment, the selectivity to HCFC-2235cb is at least 80%. Of note are embodiments wherein x is from about 0.10 to 3.00 and y is 0. Aluminum halide compositions of this type are known; see U. S. Patent Nos. 5,157,171 and 5,162,594. In some cases HCFC-31 may be employed in the formation of the aluminum halide composition. In other embodiment, trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-1 1 ) is employed in the formation of the aluminum halide composition. Thus, in some embodiments, use of sufficient excess of HCFC-31 enables the production of AICIxF3-x in s/ft/ from anhydrous aluminum chloride so that a fluorine- containing catalyst is obtained. The addition reaction involving HCFC-31 and TFE is based on a stoichiometry of 1 mole of HCFC-31 per mole of TFE. However, an excess of either reactant may be used as desired. Typically, the mole ratio of TFE to HCFC-31 is about 1 .5 or less (e.g., from about 0.3:1 to about 1 .1 :1 ). The process can be conducted batchwise or in a continuous manner. In the continuous mode, a mixture of HCFC-31 and TFE may be passed through or over a bed or body of the aluminum halide composition (which may be under agitation) at suitable temperature and pressure to form a product stream, and the desired products (e.g., HCFC-235cb) may be recovered from the stream by conventional methods such as fractional distillation. In the batch process, the reactants and the aluminum halide composition may be combined in a suitable reactor to form a reaction mixture, and the mixture held at a suitable temperature and pressure (normally under agitation) until a desired degree of conversion is obtained. In one embodiment, the reactor is initially charged with the aluminum halide composition, and optionally with a diluent, and the HCFC-31 and TFE are fed in the desired mole ratio (as separate streams or as a combined stream) into the reactor and maintained therein until the reaction is substantially complete. If the reactor is fed with HCFC-31 and the aluminum halide composition prior to the substantial absence of the TFE, the reactor and ingredients is preferably kept relatively cold (e.g., between about -78°C and 10°C) to discourage disproportionation of the HCFC-31 to fluorine-substituted methanes having a different fluorine content. The process may be practiced with or without a solvent or diluent for the HCFC-31 and TFE. Typically, the HCFC-31 and TFE are diluted; however, the diluent may be primarily the HCFC-235cb produced in the addition reaction. Solvents which may be used include chlorocarbons (e.g., , and CCU), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (e.g., CHCI2CF3 and mixtures of dichloropentafluoropropanes such as CHCI2C2F5 and CHCIFCF2CCIF2), and chlorofluorocarbons (e.g., CCIF2CCIF2), and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the addition reaction zone temperature is typically in the range of from about 25°C to about 40°C. In another embodiment the addition reaction zone temperature is in the range of from about 30°C to about 40°C. The reaction pressure may vary widely but normally the reaction is carried out at elevated pressures, particularly pressures generated autogenously in conformity with the reaction temperature employed. The pressure may be adjusted by controlling the amount of unreacted HCFC- 31 and TFE. At normally employed temperatures, the reaction time is typically between about 0.2 hour and 12 hours. The amount of aluminum halide composition employed is typically in the range of from about 1 to 20 weight percent, based on the weight of the HCFC-31 reactant. The effluent from the reaction zone (continuous or batch) typically includes HCFC-235cb, unreacted HCFC-31 and/or TFE, other HCFC-235 isomers such as CH2FCF2CCIF2. The effluent may also include one or more by-products such as CH2CI2 and CH2CICF2CCIF2. The reaction products may be recovered from the reaction zone by use of conventional means such as filtration and/or distillation. In batch mode, it is normally convenient to separate the reaction products from the aluminum halide composition and to use the separated aluminum halide composition in subsequent reactions.
