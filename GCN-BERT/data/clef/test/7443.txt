The process steps mentioned above can also be used for reducing chloride emissions when recovering at least one metal from a metal containing resource, in particular containing at least one metal oxide. Examples of resources are ore, slag, mill scale, scrap, dust, glass, electronic waste material.

Such cathode bag is preferably made from alumina and has preferably a plurality of holes. The heating means can be any kind of heating means commonly used in metallurgical processes or processes for heating salt melts. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows a schematic setup of the apparatus for recovering metals. DESCRIPTION The salt melt and the aluminum are heated to a temperature where both are in liquid phase. To improve viscosity of the salt melt the temperature of the salt melt is preferably at least 50° C. above the liquidus temperature of the salt melt, more preferably at least 100° C. above liquidus temperature of the salt melt. The temperature should be at least 660° C. and not more than 1000° C., preferably the temperature is in the range of 700-900° C. To start the reactions, the 5-20 wt % of an initiating chloride donor is added to the salt melt. The initiating chloride donor is preferably aluminum chloride, but it could also be one or more metal chlorides that are electrolyzed to form aluminum chloride with the aluminum melt. In a first embodiment of the invention, schematically exemplified by FIG. 1, a first graphite electrode is immersed in the salt melt. During the electrolysis the first graphite electrode is connecting to negative polarity and the crucible to positive polarity. The crucible being at least partly made of a conductive material which in contact with the aluminum melt. Thereby the first cathode operates as a cathode, whereas the crucible and the molten aluminum operate as an anode. Thus the first graphite electrode and the crucible are connected to a DC source. The voltage is depends on which metal to extract, and is typically around 1 volt above the decomposition voltage of the corresponding metal chloride. Different metals can be deposited by selective electrodepositing methods. AlCl3 acts as a chlorine donor dissolving metal oxides to metal chlorides in the salt melt. The following reaction occurs between AlCl3 and metal oxide/s in the salt melt [in-line-formulae]3MOX+2XAlCl3→3MCl2x+XAl2O3 (1)[/in-line-formulae] During the electrolysis metals/s from metal chloride/s is deposited at the cathode. At the contact surface between the salt melt and the aluminum melt chlorine ions are reacting with aluminum, thereby forming AlCl3. This means that during steady state the salt melt can be wholly or partly self-supporting in regards of AlCl3 and also that emission of chloride gas is reduced. [in-line-formulae]Al3++3Cl−→AlCl3 (2)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]M2x++2x e−→M (3)[/in-line-formulae] At the cathode metal/s are deposited in solid or liquid state for metal/s with lower melting point than the temperature of the salt melt. For collecting liquid metal, e.g. lead, a pervious cathode bag may be provided around the cathode. The cathode bag suitably is made from alumina and has a plurality of holes, through which the ions can pass. The holes may be cuts extending in the circumferential direction. As the metal oxide/s of the metal oxide containing resource is consumed, more metal oxide/s can be stepwise or continuously added to the salt melt. The electrolysis can for instance be performed for 2-8 hours; where after metals deposited at the cathode/s is collected. The residue after processing contains Al2O3 and for instance other stable oxides such as SiO2, depending on the contents of the metal oxide containing resource. For instance CRT glass contains SiO2. The residues may for instance be used for landfill, building construction or as a raw material for the refractory industry. Metals that can be recovered include metals from the groups 4-14 in the periodic table, e.g. metals from the group: titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), manganese (Mn), technetium (Tc), rhenium (Re), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), osmium (Os), cobalt (Co), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), aluminium (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), thallium (Tl), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb). Such metals can be recovered from various metal containing resources, in particular metal oxides, for example: Low grade ores. Sulfide ores. Ocean floor nodule ores. Ores that are difficult to process with present technologies as the valuable metals are bounded to silicates e.g. laterite ores containing nickel or cobalt. Process slag from the metallurgical industry. Slag from primarily steel plants producing high alloyed steels, such as tool steels and stainless steels, contains appreciable amounts of valuable metals, such as chromium, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, cobalt and tungsten. This slag is presently dumped, which is an environmentally unsuitable method and a waste of valuable and limited resources. Mill scale obtained at hot forming of high alloyed steels, such as tool steels, high-speed steels and stainless steels. Scrap containing valuable elemental metals, e.g. of cemented carbide containing more than 70% by weight of tungsten. “Cemented carbide”, also called hardmetal, is a metal matrix composite where tungsten carbide particles are the aggregate and metallic cobalt serves as the matrix. Dust from steel production having a combined amount of chromium and nickel of more than 5% by weight. Electronic waste material such as circuit boards, components, displays.
