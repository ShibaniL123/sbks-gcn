(dec.). 3.2 7-Cyclopentyl-N,N-dimethyl-2-(5-(piperazin-1-yl)pyridin-2-ylamino)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide (A4) A nitrogen-flushed, 3 L Argonaut reactor system is charged with 67.4 g (0.126 mol, 1.0 eq.) of tert-Butyl 4-(6-(7-cyclopentyl-6-(dimethylcarbamoyl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-ylaminopyridin-3-yl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (A3) and 329 g (380 mL) of toluene. The suspension is stirred and cooled to 12±3° C. 138 g (126 mL, 6.0 eq) of 6N aqueous hydrochloric acid is added over 30 min maintaining a batch temperature≦15±3° C. The resulting 2-phase solution is warmed to 25±3° C. and held at this temperature for 30 min or until the remaining starting material, A3, is 2% (area normalization) as determined by HPLC analysis. The progress of the reaction is checked using the Process Steering Control. 250 g (250 mL) of 1N aqueous hydrochloric acid is added and mixture is stirred for 5 min. The 2-phase reaction mixture is filtered through 25 g of filter cel. The phases are separated. The aqueous phase (containing product) is charged to a 2 L, 4-neck, round bottom flask (equipped as described under Apparatus entry 4) and cooled to 15±3° C. The pH is adjusted to 3.2±0.3 with the slow addition of 62 g (41 mL) of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide, a batch temperature≦27±3° C. is maintained throughout the addition. 16.4 g of Si-Thiol functionalized silica gel is added. The slurry is stirred for 3 hours at 50±3° C. The resin is filtered off, the flask and filter cake are rinsed with 50 mL of water. The wash is combined with the filtrate. The filtrate is transferred back to the flask and 16.4 g of Si-Thiol functionalized silica gel is added. The slurry is stirred for 3 hours at 50±3° C. The silica gel is filtered off. The flask and filter cake are rinsed with 50 mL of water. The wash is combined with the filtrate. The filtrate is transferred back to the flask and again 16.4 g of Si-Thiol functionalized silica gel is added. The slurry is stirred for 3 hours at 50±3° C. The silica gel is filtered off. The flask and filter cake are rinsed with 50 mL of water. The wash is combined with the filtrate. A nitrogen-flushed, 3 L, Argonaut reactor system is charged with the filtrate and cooled to 15±3° C. The pH is adjusted to 12.5±0.5 with the slow addition of 17 g (18 mL) of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide to precipitate the product (Batch volume=900 mL, Max Vol). The sample is stirred for at least 6 h at 22±3° C. The solids are filtered through a polypropylene filter pad. The filter cake is washed four times with 340 g (4×85 mL) of water until the pH of the wash is ≦9. The solids are dried at 60° C. for at least 16 h or until the LOD is ≦1% to afford 45.7 g (84.9%, corrected) of compound A4 as a tan solid, mp 194-195° C. EXAMPLE 4 Preparation of the Succinate salt of 7-Cyclopentyl-2-(5-piperazin-1-yl-pyridin-2-ylamino)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acid dimethylamide (i.e., Compound A6, the Compound of Formula (II)) (i.e., the Compound of Formula (II), 7-Cyclopentyl-N,N-dimethyl-2-(5-(piperazin-1-yl)pyridin-2-ylamino)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide succinate) is prepared according to the Synthesis Scheme below. A nitrogen-flushed, 1 L, 4-neck, round bottom flask is charged with 11.16 g (0.0945 mol, 1.05 eq.) of succinic acid (A5), and 245 g (312 mL) of 2-propanol. The suspension is stirred and warmed to 65±3° C. to obtain a clear solution. The solution is filtered while warmed through glass-fiber filter paper. The filtrate is held at 30±3° C. for addition to A4. A nitrogen-flushed 2 L, 4-neck, round bottom flask is charged with 39.11 g (0.09 mol, 1.0 eq) of 7-cyclopentyl-N,N-dimethyl-2-(5-(piperazin-1-yl)pyridin-2-ylamino)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide (A4) and 1115 g (1420 mL) of 2-propanol. The resulting suspension is stirred and heated to 80±3° C. to obtain a hazy yellow solution. The solution is cooled to 70±3° C. and filtered through a 25 g pad of Celite. The warm, filtered A4 solution is transferred to a nitrogen-flushed, 3 L, Argonaut reactor system and re-heated to 80±3° C. The succinic acid/2-propanol solution is added over 1 h maintaining 80±3° C. throughout the addition. The batch is seeded after 80% of the succinic acid solution has been added. The sample is stirred at 80±3° C. for 1 h after the addition is completed and cooled to 20±3° C. over 1 h, held 30 minutes and the solids are filtered. The filter cake is washed with 78 g (100 mL) of 2-propanol. The solids are dried at 60° C. for at least 16 h or until the LOD is ≦1% to afford 47.16 g (94.9%, corrected) of Compound A6 as a yellow, crystalline solid, mp 202-203° C. EXAMPLE 5 Physical Form Characterization of the Compound of Formula (II) Under 90% RH To understand its hygroscopic nature, Compound A6 obtained in Example 4 is exposed to two moisture cycle of 0 to 90 to 0% RH. Table 1 and FIG. 1 shows the Compound A6 absorbs up to 2% moisture at 90% RH in each cycle, reflecting slight hygroscopic behavior at high humidity conditions. Also a steep rise in moisture absorption is observed at 90% RH condition in each cycle and difference in sorption and desorption behavior reflects a formation of hydrate form is taking place at 90% RH condition. FIGS. 2, 3 and 4 show change in physical form up on exposure to 90% RH for the compound A6 as a different crystalline form is observed with a endothermic transition which shows a weight loss of 3% around 100° C., both of which conversion to a hydrate form after exposure to 90% RH. At 90% RH, about 7.35% of the Compound A6 obtained in Example 4 is converted from the non-hydrate form to hydrate form. EXAMPLE 6 Physical Form Characterization of the Compound of Formula (II) Under 90% RH To confirm that the form change observed under 90% RH is not taking place at 80% RH, compound A6 obtained in Example 4 is exposed to a moisture cycle of 0 to 80 to 0% RH. Table 2 and FIG. 5 shows Compound A6 absorbs up to 0.5% moisture at 80% RH reflecting nearly non-hygroscopic behavior at 80° C. FIGS. 5 and 6 show stability of the physical form of Compound of Formula (II) up on exposure to 80% RH which is reflective of non-hydrate form. Since for stability of drug substance and drug product a physical form stability at 75% RH is desirable, Compound of Formula (II) (non-hydrate) is suitable for development. At 80% RH, only about 0.52% of the Compound A6 obtained in Example 4 is converted from the non-hydrate form to hydrate form. EXAMPLE 7 Solubility The solubility of the non-hydrate form in water is about 30 mg/ml. In contrast, the solubility of the hydrate form is significantly lower and is less than 0.5 mg/ml.
