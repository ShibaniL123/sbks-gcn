FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to improved rear-view mirrors for attachment to head gear to allow wearer to have a full range view of the areas peripheral to and behind his forward field of vision, and that is firmly attached and secured to the headgear to prevent dislodging or repositioning of the mirror during vigorous movement or collision. DISCUSSION OF THE BACKGROUND Helmets are generally used in situations where a danger of head injury is presented due to contact by heavy equipment (e.g., construction equipment), collisions between people (e.g., in contact sports like football and hockey), projectiles (e.g., in the case of war and police actions), falling and contact with the ground (e.g., motorcycle accidents), etc. In such situations, awareness of ones surroundings is critically important. One can avoid injuries, if he is aware of potential dangers in his vicinity, both in front of him and behind him. Thus, the ability of an individual to see what is going on behind him and to the periphery without the need to turn his body or head provides a significant advantage. The individual can quickly check what is going on behind him quickly, without fully disengaging from the visual field in front of him. Such an advantage can significantly reduce the chances of being injured (e.g., shot on battlefield), of being tackled (e.g., in a football game), or being injured in an accident. Lately, there have been many stories about the serious health problems that develop as football player's age. There has much discussion about new ways to make the game of football safer for these players. Many ideas are focused on ways to eliminate the detrimental effects caused by multiple head injuries and concussions. The players' helmets so they will see threats coming from the rear or the sides. While these tackles and hard hits may not be avoided completely, players may be prepared and positioned in ways so they will experience fewer serious injuries, particularly to their heads. There are existing designs for helmet mirrors that are arguably functional; however, many have disadvantages that reduce their usefulness by being cumbersome, clumsy, and easily displaced such that they are rendered unusable. It is therefore desirable to provide peripheral and rear view mirror devices that are more practical. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a rear and peripheral view mirror assembly which may be attached to a helmet or other headgear in a position above the wearer's eyes and in close proximity to the wearer's eyes. The mirror assembly does not obstruct the wearer's forward field of vision and allows the wearer to quickly glance at the mirror to without the need for the wearer to turn his head. The positioning and design of the mirror may allow the wearer to quickly view the areas peripheral to and behind his head during activities that require the wearer's attention on the forward field of view (e.g., sports such as football and hockey, riding motorcycles and bicycles, armed combat, etc.). The mirror assembly of the present invention may provide the wearer with a wide view of the area behind his head during rigorous activity. The rearview mirror device may also have a sturdy attachment mechanism for connected to a helmet or other headgear that can withstand collisions and violent shaking or impact without becoming dislodged. The mirror may be elongate and convex to allow the wearer to view a wide range of angles to the posterior to the wearer's head, giving the wearer the ability to view virtually the entire area peripheral to and behind the mirror (e.g., a mirror mounted on the right side of a helmet may provide reflective views of nearly all areas peripheral to and behind the right side of the helmet). If the wearer installs two mirror assemblies on his headgear (one on each side of the headgear), he may be provided with views of his entire surroundings without the need to change his direction of travel, to turn his head, or to divert his attention from the forward visual field for more than a few moments (e.g., as little as about 100 ms). The mirror may also have an adjustable position to allow the wearer to move angle the mirror to his liking. The rearview mirror device of the present invention may allow the wearer to view the area behind him quickly and efficiently, allowing him to react to threats or hazards. For example, and without limitation, a football player wearing a device according to the present invention on his helmet may quickly glance into the rearview mirror to determine whether there are any defenders close by and then change direction or take other action to avoid being tackled by the defenders. In a further example, and without limitation, an infantryman wearing the rearview mirror device on his helmet may glance behind to determine to stay aware of his fellow infantryman and their positions around him and/or to determine whether there is enemy personnel behind him. In a still further example, and without limitation, a bicyclist wearing the rearview mirror device on his helmet may view upcoming traffic without having to take his eyes off of the road for more than a period of a few hundred milliseconds. The device may include an elongate convex mirror, which may provide reflection of a wide range of light ray angles from behind the wearer's helmet or headgear. Although the reflection of the image may be smaller, the mirror provides the wearer with enough visual information to be aware of the presence of a threat or hazard located behind the wearer without the need for him to turn his head. In embodiments where the mirror is convex, incident light rays that strike the mirror's surface traveling towards the focal point of the mirror will reflect and travel parallel to the principal axis and generally toward the eye of the wearer. The wearer may also scan along the major axis of the mirror to view light striking the mirror at different angles, allowing the wearer to perceive visual information coming from a wide range of angles striking the mirror. The mirror that may be included in the devices of the present invention may be relatively small. For example, and without limitation, the mirrors of the present invention may be elongate (e.g., ellipsoidal convex mirrors) having a major (horizontal) axis in a range of about one to about three inches (e.g., about 1.5 to about 2.5 inches, or any value therein) and a minor (vertical) axis in a range of about ½ inch to about 1.5 inches (e.g., about ¾ to about 1 inch, or any value therein). These axes may intersect one another at right angles at the center point (or apex) of the lens. In some embodiments, and without limitation, the ellipsoidal mirror may have radii of curvature that are constant or substantially constant (e.g., measured along planar cross-sections that are parallel to the major or minor axis). For example, and without limitation, if a line were traced along the major axis of the lens from one point on the periphery to a point on the periphery on the opposite end of the line, the radius of curvature along the line would be constant. Similarly, the radius of curvature of a line traced on the surface of the lens along the minor axis from one end point on the periphery to the opposite end point on the periphery may be constant as well. The resulting mirror surface having a constant radius of curvature along the major axis may produce proportional images of the objects viewed via the mirror, while still providing a view of a large visual field to the rear and periphery of the wearer. In other embodiments of the present invention, and without limitation, the ellipsoidal mirror may have radii of curvature (e.g., measured along planar cross-sections) that vary. For example, and without limitation, the radii of curvature of a planar cross-section of the mirror may decrease from the center point of the mirror toward the peripheral edge of the mirror. Stated another way, the lateral portions of the mirror (near the lateral ends of the major axis) may have a shorter radius of curvature than the central portions of the mirror to shorten the focal length of the lateral portions. The shorter radii of curvature near the periphery of the mirror may provide a large field of view for monitoring the area behind the wearer's head. In still further embodiments, and without limitation, the mirror may have other shapes, such as a mirror having only horizontal radii of curvature (e.g., a mirror that resembles about a 30° to about a 120° arc section of a cylinder). The mirror may be mounted on a housing through a joint structure that allows the mirror to be adjusted to the wearer's preference. For example, and without limitation, the mirror may be connected to a housing by a ball joint that allows the angle of the surface of the mirror to be adjusted by the wearer to maximize the wearer's ability to see behind and to the side of his forward field of vision. The mirror may be reposition along horizontal, vertical and oblique planes, and may also swivel to rotate the major and minor axes of the mirror. The device may also include a locking mechanism for holding the mirror in a static orientation, once the mirror is in the wearer's desired position. For example, and without limitation, the device may include a pin or a bolt that can be advanced into the ball joint to apply pressure to the ball stud and arrest its movement within the joint. The housing may connect the mirror to the anchoring structures of the device. The housing may function to protect the mirror being displaced or jostled from its position. For example, and without limitation, the housing may cover the backside of the mirror to protect the mirror from any direct contact that may dislodge it from its position. To illustrate, if the device is worn on a football helmet, the housing may prevent the mirror from being contacted during a tackle or a fall to the ground. In some embodiments, and without limitation, the housing may surround each side of the mirror except the reflective surface, while still providing enough space between the housing and the mirror to allow it to be adjusted by the wearer. The housing may be attached to one or more anchoring members that may function to attach the device to a helmet or other headgear. The housing may be attached to the one or more anchoring members by various mechanisms. For example, and without limitation, the housing may be attached to the one or more anchoring members by pins or bolts that lockingly engage the housing to the one or more anchoring members. In other examples, and without limitation, the housing may be connected to the one or more anchoring members by rotatable joints that allow the anchoring members to be positioned at various angles relative to the housing. The adjustable attachment to the housing for the mirror to allow the clips to be attached to structures and surfaces of the headgear that are positioned along various planes and at various angles, while still allowing the mirror to be positioned near and facing the wearer's eyes in a substantially vertical orientation. The rotatable joints of such examples may be rotatable around a horizontal axis and/or a vertical axis. For example, and without limitation, the clips may be attached to the housing for the mirror by hinge joints that allow the clips to rotate with respect to the housing (along a vertical plane and a horizontal axis) so that the clips can be attached to structures and surfaces that are located at various angles. In other examples, and without limitation, the clips may be attached to the housing for the mirror by rotatable pivot joint that allows the clips to rotate along a horizontal plane (e.g., along a vertical axis) to allow the clips to adjust to curved surfaces (e.g., like the shell of a helmet). In still further implementations, and without limitation, the clips may be able to rotate along both a horizontal and vertical axes to allow for adjustment in multiple axes. The adjustability of the joints between the housing and the anchoring members may assist in positioning the mirror in an optimal position for the wearer at a distance that allows the wearer to easily accommodate the images reflected by the mirror. For example, the adjustability of the joints may assist in the mirror be positioned at a distance of at least about 2.25 inches from the eye, which about minimum distance for accommodation by the human eye. The one or more anchoring members of the present invention may be attachment mechanisms for attaching the mirror and housing of the device to a helmet or other headgear. In some embodiments, and without limitation, the one or more anchoring members may be clips (e.g., alligator-style clips) that can be clasped to the shell of a helmet, the brim of a helmet or hat, the face mask of a football helmet, and other structures of a piece of headgear located near the eyes of the wearer. Such clips may include grips or handles that a person can grasp with the fingers to open the clip to attach it to headgear. In other embodiments, and without limitation, the one or more anchoring members may be a vise-style clamp that is tightened by a bolt structure. In such embodiments, the two sides of the clamp are tightened down on each side of the shell of a helmet (or other structure, such as a face mask, brim, visor, etc.) as the bolt is turned. The position of the one or more anchoring members may be secured by a locking mechanism that prevents the anchoring structure from becoming loosened from the helmet or other head gear. For example, and without limitation, in embodiments in which the one or more anchoring members are alligator-style clips, the anchoring member may include a locking nut that can be (1) tightened down on the joint between the two sides of the clip, such that the clip cannot be opened, or (2) oriented provide pressure on the interior side of the clip handles to prevent the handles from opening the clips. In other examples, and without limitation, the locking mechanism may be a bar or bracket that can connect and hold the two sides of the clip together to prevent the two sides from being spread apart. In still other examples, and without limitation, a locking bolt or pin may be inserted through the two sides of the clip to hold and lock the two sides together. In some embodiments, and without limitation, the adjustable joints between the clips and the housing for the mirror may be lockable as well. For example, and without limitation, hinge joints between the clips and the housing may include a locking bolt or pin that squeezes the adjustable joint to arrest its movement. As a further example, and without limitation, pivot joints between the clips and the housing may include a locking bolt or pin that squeezes the adjustable joint to arrest its movement.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Reference will now be made in detail to certain embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in reference to these embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention. To the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents that are included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims. In the following disclosure, specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. The present invention generally provides a reflective mirror assembly that can be positioned on headgear above and near the wearer's eyes without obstructing the wearer's vision, and may allow the wearer to efficiently and effectively view the areas that are peripheral to and behind his normal field of vision. The mirror assembly of the present invention represents an effective solution to the problem of providing adequate rear and peripheral vision for athletes, cyclists, construction jobsite workers, armed forces, police, and others by providing a stably attachable mirror for safety headgear that can be positioned such that the wearer can quickly glance at the mirror without the need to turn his head or to abandon his forward field of vision for a significant amount of time (e.g., less than a second), and provides a wide visible field of the peripheral and rear areas. The rearview mirror apparatus may be secured to the helmet such that it does not jostle or move in the event of violent movement, such as a collision. The apparatus may include at least one sturdy anchoring member (e.g., a clip) that tightly engages with the shell or other stable structure on the helmet such that the one or more anchoring members cannot be displaced without a substantial amount of force applied to the one or more anchoring members. In some embodiments, and without limitation, the rearview mirror apparatus may include two adjacent alligator-style clips that each pinch the shell of the helmet with substantial force. The mirror assembly may also be adaptable for attachment to a face shield, a face mask, a helmet shell, and/or other structures on the headgear. The anchoring members may include a locking mechanism (e.g., a locking bolt or pin) that may aid in preventing the anchoring members from being displaced during a collision. The anchoring members may be attached to a housing or bracket structure by a movable or static attachment. The housing may be attached to the at least one anchoring member by at least one pin structure and is statically positioned relative to the one or more clips. The one or more pins may be pressure fitted into the anchoring members, or attached by some other means. In other examples, the anchoring member may be attached to the housing by rotatable joints that allow the mirror apparatus to be attached to various structures and surfaces on various forms of headgear. The rotatable clips may be rotated through a wide range of angles relative to the housing or bracket structure. For example, and without limitation, the rotatable clips may be positioned at angles relative to the housing in a range of about 220°. The mirror may be a convex elongate mirror that may provide a substantial viewing field of the area behind the helmet or headgear to which it is attached. For example, the mirror may have an ellipsoidal shape having a horizontal major axis and a vertical minor axis. The mirror may be attached to the housing such that the position of the mirror can be manipulated both vertically and horizontally to allow the wearer to position the mirror to their preference. For example, and without limitation, the mirror may be attached to the housing by a single ball stud fitted into a ball cavity within the housing. In some implementations, the housing may include a locking mechanism to hold the ball stud and mirror in a static position, once the wearer has positioned the mirror in a desired position. For example, the housing may having a locking bolt on the posterior side thereof that applies pressure to the ball stud within the ball joint when it is tightened to thereby arrest the ball stud in position. Other locking mechanisms are contemplated within the scope of the present disclosure. Referring to the drawings wherein like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and referring particularly to FIG. 1-______, it is seen that the present invention includes various embodiments of a rear and peripheral view mirror assembly for connection to headgear (e.g., a helmet) to allow a wearer of the headgear to quickly view peripheral and posterior areas that are not within the wearer's normal range of vision. It is also evident in the drawings that the invention includes methods of using the rear and peripheral view mirror assembly. Without limiting the invention, FIG. 1A shows an exemplary embodiment of a mirror assembly 100 attached to a helmet, such that it would be positioned above the eyes of the wearer. The mirror is convex such that may reflect light striking the mirror surface in a large range of angles toward the wearer's eyes. The mirror assembly 100 may provide elongate convex mirror that provides views of both peripheral and rear areas, allowing the wearer to react to objects and movement (e.g., an opponent in a football game) without the need to turn his head round to view the object or movement directly. FIG. 1B provides a visual representation of the range of angles that may be perceived by the wearer of helmet 10 (see representative light ray angles 20 and 21). The mirror 100 can be seen positioned to the right of where the wearer's right eye would be located. The mirror 100 can be adjusted in its position within its housing to maximize the range of peripheral and rear angles that the wearer may perceive. As shown in FIG. 1B, the wearer may perceive a range of angles that approaches 90° (e.g., up to about 80°) while maintaining the position of the mirror at relatively close proximity to the wearer's eye (e.g., in a range of about 2.25 inches to about 4 inches, about 2.5 inches to about 3.5 inches, or any value therein). The mirror assembly 100 may also have a sturdy attachment to the headgear to prevent dislodging or jostling of the mirror in the case of vigorous movement (e.g., running) or a collision (e.g., a tackle). The mirror assembly may include one or more strong anchoring members for preventing movement of the assembly from its position. For example, and without limitation, mirror assembly 100 includes two anchoring members 103a and 103b, which are alligator-style clips (e.g., made from strong spring steel) that are operable to clip onto a surface of the headgear (e.g., the shell of the football helmet). The anchoring members 103a and 103b may additionally include a locking mechanism that prevents the jaws of the anchoring member from opening. The mirror assembly may further include a housing 102 that both holds the mirror and attaches to the anchoring members 103a and 103b. The connection between the housing 102 and the anchoring members 103a and 103b may be static and may lock the housing into position above the wearer's eyes. For example, and without limitation, the anchoring members 103a and 103b may be attached to the housing 102 by lockable or pressure-fitted pins that hold the housing in a static position. The mirror may be adjustably attached to the housing by a rotatable joint (e.g., a ball joint) to allow the wearer to adjust the position of the mirror to his preference (e.g., to maximize his ability to see images behind him and in his periphery). The joint between the mirror and the housing 102 may also be lockable to prevent the mirror from being dislodged from the wearer's preferred position, even if the wearer experiences vigorous shaking or a collision. Additionally, the housing 102 may provide a protective shield to protect the mirror from being contacted and thereby dislodged. For example, and without limitation, the housing 102 completely covers the backside of the mirror (not shown in FIG. 1 because it is obstructed by the housing) and prevents contact with the mirror by any oncoming objects. Without limiting the invention, an exemplary embodiment of the mirror assembly is shown in FIGS. 2A-2F. The mirror assembly 200 includes an adjustable mirror 201, a housing 202, and anchoring members 203a and 203b. The anchoring members 203a and 203b may be alligator-style clips as shown in FIGS. 2A-2B, having finger or tool grips 204 that allow the user to open the clips and apply them to a surface or portion of a piece of headgear. In some embodiments, and without limitation, the anchoring members may be connected to the superior surface of the housing 202 by rotating pivot joints 210 that allow the anchoring members to spin around the vertical axis of the pivot joints to accommodate curved surfaces (e.g., the shell of a helmet). Once the anchoring members 203a and 203b are attached to the headgear, they are fixed in position, such that the anchoring members 203a and 203b and the housing 202 cannot rotate relative to each other, and the housing is in a fixed position with regard to the headgear. In other embodiments, and without limitation, the alligator clips may be separate from the other elements of the mirror assembly prior to attachment to a piece of headgear. As shown in the exploded view of FIG. 2E, the anchoring members 203a and 203b may be separate from the housing 202 and the mirror 201 prior to attachment to the headgear. After the anchoring members 203a and 203b are attached to the headgear, the anchoring members 203a and 203b may be attached to the housing 202 of the mirror assembly by pegs 211. The pegs 211 may be pressure fitted into the anchoring members 203a and 203b and into the superior surface of the housing 202 to create a static joint between the anchoring members 203a and 203b and the housing 202. As shown in FIGS. 2A-2F, and without limitation, the mirror 201 may be placed in a setting 201a that may be attached to the housing 202. Both the setting 201a and the housing 202 may have a convex shape to accommodate the shape of the mirror 201, and to allow the mirror 201 to be moved in various angles and planes without being obstructed by the housing 202. The joint 205 between the housing 202 and the setting 201a may be a joint that allows smooth movement in all directions and rotation (e.g., a ball joint). The joint 205 may allow the wearer to position the mirror in a desired position, such that the wearer can maximize his view of the areas to the periphery and behind his forward visual field. In some embodiments, and without limitation, the joint 205 may be lockable to hold the mirror 201 in a desired position and prevent jostling in the event of a collision or violent movement. For example, and without limitation, FIG. 2F shows an implementation of the mirror assembly 200 that includes a wing bolt 220 on the forward surface of the housing 202, which may be tightened down to apply pressure to a ball within the joint 205, and thereby arrest the movement of the mirror 201. Other locking mechanisms may be used to arrest the position of the mirror 201 as well. The housing 202 has a width and height that is sufficient to cover the backside of the mirror setting 201a, and thus the housing 202 may protect the mirror 201 from being dislodged in the case of vigorous movement, violent shaking, or collision. This may improve the utility of the mirror assembly 200 by eliminating the need to readjust the mirror repeatedly during use. For example, the protective shape and position of the housing may allow a football player to avoid the need to reposition the mirror after each time he is tackled. In other embodiments of the present invention, and without limitation, the anchoring members may rotatable with respect to the mirror assembly housing along a horizontal axis. FIGS. 3A-3E show an exemplary embodiment of a mirror assembly 300 that includes anchoring members 303a and 303b that can be rotated around a horizontal axis in order to be attached to structures on a piece of headgear that are positioned at various angles or orientation. The rotatable joints allow the mirror assembly 300 to be attached to a piece of headgear that has structures of various shapes that may be positioned at various angles. The mirror assembly 300 includes an adjustable mirror 301, a housing 302, and anchoring members 303a and 303b. The anchoring members 303a and 303b may be alligator-style clips as shown in FIGS. 3A-3E, having finger or tool grips 304 that allow the user to open the clips and apply them to a surface or portion of a piece of headgear. In some embodiments, and without limitation, the anchoring members may be connected to the superior surface of the housing 302 by rotating pivot joints 320 that allow the anchoring members to spin around the horizontal axes of the pivot joints 320 to accommodate surfaces at various angles. Each of these pivot joints 320 includes brackets 321 located at each lateral side of the anchoring member that are attached to the superior surface of the housing 302. A cylindrical axle 322 may be connected to the anchoring member by a bracket 323. A wing bolt 325 (or other fastening device) may pass through the bracket 321 and the axle 322. The axle may be threaded to receive male threading of the wing bolt 323. The wing bolt 323 may be used to tighten and cinch down the pivot joint between the brackets 321 and 323, once the anchoring member is in a desired position relative to the housing 302. The tightened bolt 323 may prevent movement between the anchoring member (303a or 303b) and the housing 302. FIG. 3E provides an example view of the mirror assembly 300 with the anchoring member 303a rotated forward 90° relative to anchoring member 303b. This arrangement may be necessary for certain kinds of headgear, or the wearer's preferred position of the mirror assembly on the headgear (e.g., a football player may attached one of the anchoring members to the face mask of his helmet and the other to the shell of the helmet). As shown in FIGS. 3A-3E, and without limitation, the mirror 301 may be placed in a setting 301a that may be attached to the housing 302. Both the setting 301a and the housing 302 may have a convex shape to accommodate the shape of the mirror 301, and to allow the mirror 301 to be moved in various angles and planes without being obstructed by the housing 302. The joint 305 between the housing 302 and the setting 301a may be a joint that allows smooth movement in all directions and rotation (e.g., a ball joint). In some embodiments, and without limitation, the joint 305 may include a locking mechanism to hold the mirror 301 in a desired position and prevent jostling in the event of a collision or violent movement (e.g., the mirror assembly 300 may include a locking bolt like that shown in FIG. 2F and discussed above). The housing 302 may have a width and height that is sufficient to cover the backside of the mirror setting 301a, and thus the housing 302 may protect the mirror 301 from being dislodged in the case of vigorous movement, violent shaking, or collision, and thereby eliminate the need to readjust the mirror repeatedly during use. In other embodiments of the present invention, and without limitation, the anchoring members may have a different design. For example, and without limitation, FIGS. 4A-4E show a mirror assembly 400 that utilizes an alligator-style clip having rigid clip arms that are attached at a pivoting joint 410 that is biased toward the closed position by a spring 411 (e.g., a coil spring). The spring 411 may have substantial strength to allow the anchor members to tightly grip various structures on the headgear. The mirror assembly 400 generally includes an adjustable mirror 401, a housing 402, and anchoring members 403a and 403b. The anchoring members 403a and 403b. The anchoring members 403a and 403b may be attached to the housing 402 through an anchor plate 403 that is attached to the back side of the housing 402. The anchor plate 430 may be sturdily attached to the housing 402 (e.g., the anchor plate may be bolted to the housing, integrally formed with the housing, etc.). The anchoring members 403a and 403b may be attached to the anchor plate 430 by pivoting joints 435a and 435b, which allow rotation around a horizontal axis. The pivoting joints 435a and 435b allow the anchor members 403a and 403b to be rotated around a horizontal axis through a wide range of angles (e.g., about 110° of rotation) in order to be attached to structures on a piece of headgear that are positioned at various angles or orientation. The pivoting joints may allow the mirror assembly 400 to be attached to a piece of headgear that has structures of various shapes that may be positioned at various angles. The pivoting joints may be lockable to arrest the relative position of the anchoring members and the mirror such that the mirror is held in a steady positioned during use. For example, the hinge joint may include a long bolt (e.g., a wing bolt) that can be inserted into the hinge joint to arrest its position. In some implementations, and without limitation, the anchoring members 403a and 403b may be attached to the housing 402 by a static joint. For example, as shown in FIG. 4E, the anchoring members are attached to the anchor plate 430 by a static or fused connection. Such embodiments provide a sturdy connection between the anchoring members and the housing, but such embodiments are limited in adjustability. The anchoring members 403a and 403b may each include a locking mechanism 420 that includes a curved extension 420a attached to one of the clip arms of the anchoring member and a curved extension 420b that may be attached to the other clip arm of the anchoring member. The curved extensions 420a and 420b may be aligned such that a locking bolt 421 in the curved extension 420b and the a slot 22 in extension 420a are aligned and the anchoring member can be locked into positioned when the locking bolt is tightened to pinch the extension member 420a. Other locking mechanisms may be used as well. As shown in FIGS. 4A-4E, and without limitation, the mirror 401 may be placed in housing 402. The mirror 401 may be connected to the housing 402 by a joint that allows smooth movement in all directions and rotation (e.g., a ball joint). The housing 402 may have a convex shape and a recess 401b therein to accommodate the shape of the mirror 401 and to allow the mirror 401 to be moved in various angles and planes without being obstructed by the housing 402. In some implementations, and without limitation, the joint may include a locking mechanism to hold the mirror 401 in a desired position and prevent jostling in the event of a collision or violent movement (e.g., the mirror assembly 400 may include a locking bolt like that shown in FIG. 2F and discussed above). The housing 402 may have a width and height that is sufficient to cover the backside of the mirror 401, and thus the housing 402 may protect the mirror 401 from being dislodged in the case of vigorous movement, violent shaking, or collision, and thereby eliminate the need to readjust the mirror repeatedly during use.
