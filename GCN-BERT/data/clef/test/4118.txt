CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/731,982 filed on Nov. 30, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to the fields of biochemistry, cell biology, organic chemistry, and oncology. More specifically, it concerns methods for synthesizing inhibitors of RAD51 and inhibiting RAD51 protein activity in a cell. 2. Description of Related Art Homologous recombination (HR) is an essential process in eukaryotic cells that provides repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and lesions that block DNA replication. Faithful DSB repair by HR utilizes an undamaged sister chromatid as a template to guide the repair process. This distinguishes HR from the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway (Thompson and Schild, 2001). Since HR facilitates cellular recovery from replication-blocking lesions and collapsed replication forks, cells with impaired HR capacity are known to exhibit profound sensitivities to a class of chemotherapeutic drugs that generate inter-strand DNA crosslinks (ICLs, Tebbs et al., 1995; Liu et al., 1998; Takata et al., 2001). RAD51 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that is central to HR. One of the initial steps in HR is the polymerization of RAD51 on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), wherein protomers of RAD51 oligomerize into a helical nucleoprotein filament at the site of damaged DNA. This nucleoprotein filament subsequently searches for a homologous DNA sequence and invades it to form a joint molecule. With the assistance of other related HR proteins, accurate DNA synthesis is then performed using the undamaged sequence as a template. Over-expression of RAD51 protein in cells has been shown to elevate HR efficiency and to generate resistance to ICL-forming drugs (Vispe et al., 1998; Slupianek et al., 2001; Bello et al., 2002; Hansen et al., 2003). This has important implications for oncology research, since RAD51 is over-expressed in a wide range of human cancer cell types (Klein 2008; Hine et al., 2008). The reliance of cancer cells on RAD51-dependent HR combined with the upregulation of RAD51 in certain human cancer cell types make RAD51 a desireable target for small molecule inhibition. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Embodiments are based on the identification and characterization of compounds that alter the ability of the RAD51 protein to bind fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. Therefore, there are methods and compositions involving compounds that directly inhibit the activity of the RAD51 protein. In certain embodiments, methods and compositions concern compounds that decrease, inhibit, or reduce RAD51 activity. In certain embodiments, there are methods for inhibiting RAD51 protein in a cell comprising providing to the cell an effective amount of a RAD51 protein inhibitor, wherein the inhibitor is a small molecule that directly inhibits the activity of RAD51 protein. This means that small molecules alter the activity of RAD51 protein (or a RAD51 protein analog or homolog) directly (i.e., RAD51 activity decreases when the RAD51 protein is contacted or incubated with the small molecule), and not indirectly, such as by altering the expression level of RAD51. In some embodiments, the methods and compositions concern a compound that is a RAD51 inhibitor, meaning that the compound directly decreases, inhibits, and/or attenuates RAD51 protein activity when the RAD51 protein is exposed to the compound. The terms “inhibitor” and “antagonist” are used interchangeably herein. Therefore, embodiments cover a number of methods involving a RAD51 inhibitor, that decrease, inhibit or reduce RAD51 activity by or by at least about 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100% (and any range derivable therein) compared to RAD51 activity in the absence of the RAD51 inhibitor. Therefore, in some embodiments, there are methods for inhibiting RAD51 in a cell comprising providing to the cell an effective amount of a RAD51 small molecule that directly inhibits RAD51 activity in a cell. In particular embodiments, the RAD51 inhibitor decreases RAD51 filament formation when the inhibitor is incubated with RAD51 protein under conditions to promote filament formation. In certain other embodiments, the RAD51 inhibitor attenuates or inhibits homologous recombination via RAD51 inhibition in a cell. A RAD51 inhibitor is a compound that acts in conjunction with RAD51 protein to inhibit, attenuate or decrease the activity of the RAD51 protein. In certain embodiments the RAD51 inhibitor is a small molecular weight compound. In specific embodiments, the RAD51 inhibitor is a compound of formula: wherein R1-R5 are each separately H or halogen, and R6 and R7 are each independently H, halogen, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, heterocycle, thioether, (amine)thioether, (alkylamine)thioether, (hydroxy)thioether, 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl, N-morpholinyl, 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-ethylthioether, 2-aminoethylthioether, or 2-hydroxyethylthioether.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES The following drawings form part of the present specification and are included to further demonstrate certain aspects of the present invention. The invention may be better understood by reference to one or more of these drawings in combination with the detailed description of specific embodiments presented herein. FIG. 1. Reaction of RI-1, RI-2, and 9b with glutathione. Glutathione is a tripeptide that contains a nucleophilic sulfhydryl group. Glutathione may react irreversibly with a Michael acceptor compound containing a suitable leaving group at the 4-position. Compound 9b, containing an iodide at the 4-position, reacts rapidly with glutathione, leaving no detectable compound at the first time point measured. RI-1, containing a less efficient chloride leaving group at the 4-position, displays reduced glutathione reactivity. RI-2, containing a p-anisole at the 4-position exhibited no reactivity toward glutathione after incubation for 24 hours. FIGS. 2A-C: FIG. 2A. Schematic representation of the FP experiments. Reversible vs. irreversible inhibition of RAD51 by compound was tested by incubating compounds with RAD51 while still attached to beads and prior to washing. Alternatively, inhibition of RAD51 by compound was tested by adding the compound after the protein has been released from the beads. FIG. 2B. Inhibition of RAD51 by compound after the protein has been released from the beads. The inhibitory activity of RI-1 on the DNA binding activity of RAD51 was found to be time-dependent, consistent with the requirement for a chemical reaction to achieve inhibitory activity. This time dependence was also observed with other RI-1 analogs with intact Michael acceptor groups (data not shown). In contrast, no time-dependent increase in the inhibitory activity induced by RI-2 was observed. FIG. 2C. Reversible vs. irreversible inhibition of RAD51. Biotinylated RAD51 was immobilized on streptavidin polyacrylamide beads. The RAD51-coated beads were incubated with compound and subsequently washed extensively to remove any compound that was not covalently attached. The treated protein was subsequently cleaved from the beads and tested for DNA binding activity using our standard FP-based assay. As expected, RAD51 protein that had been treated with 10 μM RI-1 prior to washing was significantly inactivated, consistent with RI-1's established role as an irreversible inhibitor. By contrast, RAD51 protein that had been treated with RI-2 (concentrations up to 240 μM) prior to washing exhibited no measurable loss of DNA binding activity, even though RI-2 is known to inhibit RAD51 with an IC50 of 44.17 μM in the standard DNA binding assay, indicating that RAD51 inhibition by RI-2 is fully reversible. FIG. 3. Relative DNA repair efficiencies. RI-2 inhibits the efficiency of DNA repair in human cells, containing either an HR or SSA reporter. Reporter-containing HEK293 cells were electroporated with an I-SceI endonuclease-expressing plasmid, incubated with compounds as indicated for 24 hours, and subjected to FACS analysis 24 hours thereafter. Incubation of cells with 20 μM RI-1 led to an inhibition of HR and a stimulation of SSA. Despite its lack of Michael acceptor activity, RI-2 at 60 μM also led to an inhibition of HR and a stimulation of SSA by specific inhibition of RAD51 in cells. FIG. 4. RI-2 sensitizes human cells to cross-linking chemotherapy. HEK293 cells were sequentially incubated for 24 hours in media containing varying concentrations of MMC, followed by 24 hours in media containing RI-1 or RI-2. Cells were then allowed to grow in drug-free media for an additional 5-7 days. Average survival for each condition is normalized to the MMC-free control of that condition.

MMP-1-60 displays RAD51 inhibitory activity intermediate to RI-1 and RI-2 (not shown). B. MMP-1-60 toxicity to immortalized human cells. MMP-1-60 displays comparable cell toxicity, after 4 hours of pre-incubation with tissue culture media and no pre-incubation, demonstrating the stability of MMP-1-60. FIGS. 7A-7D. Structural-activity relationship data for selected RAD51 inhibitors. Inhibitory concentration for DNA binding, lethal dose (50%), sensitization to MMC and octanol/water partition coefficient are listed for RAD51 inhibitors. FIG. 8. RS-3 generate anti-tumor responses in a mouse xenograft tumor model. PC3 tumors were induced in the hind limbs of athymic nude mice. Mice were then randomized into three treatment groups. Starting on day 0, mice then received 5 daily intra-peritoneal injections with either RS-2 (12.4 mg/kg), RS-4 (15.7 mg/kg), or vehicle alone control. For both compounds, the daily dose administered to the mice was designed to yield an idealized concentration of 40.8 μM within the aqueous compartment of a mouse, based on an assumption of homogenous distribution across a 21 gm animal that is composed of 70% water. FIGS. 9A-9C: A. MMP-1-60 toxicity in mice. Weight loss in mice is measured as an indicator of MMP-1-60 toxicity. The graph illustrates percent weight relative to day for several mice. B. RI-2 toxicity in mice. Weight loss in mice is measured as an indicator of RI-2 toxicity. The graph illustrates percent weight relative to day for several mice. C. Control mice. Percent weight relative to day is illustrated for a number of control mice. DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art by providing compounds that inhibit the activity of a protein involved in homologous recombinational (HR) DNA repair, RAD51. As discussed above, HR DNA repair confers cellular resistance to ionizing radiation and certain DNA damaging agents, including some anti-cancer drugs. Pharmacologic manipulation of HR levels may be used to modulate this resistance. RAD51 is the central protein involved in the initiation of HR. Drugs that reduce RAD51 function could potentially be used to inhibit HR in cancer cells, thereby overcoming the resistance of malignant tumors to common oncologic therapies. A targeted approach that focuses on HR is particularly appealing, since several studies have suggested that HR inhibition preferentially sensitizes tumor cells relative to normal cells (Russell et al., 2003; Ito et al., 2005). In one such study, Gleevec-mediated inhibition of RAD51 expression resulted in an elevated radio-sensitivity for glioma cancer cell lines, but had no significant effect on normal human fibroblasts (Russell et al., 2003). Similarly, Ito et. al. blocked RAD51 expression with siRNA techniques in various human cancer cell lines. The sensitivity to cisplatin was enhanced in all of the human cancer cell lines tested, but not in normal human fibroblasts (Ito et al., 2005). Therefore, a strategy for pharmacologic inhibition of HR holds promise for improving the therapeutic ratios of existing oncology treatments. A. RAD51 PROTEIN RAD51 filament formation is a well accepted critical step in the initiation of HR repair. Biochemical studies have shown that RAD51 protein assembles into filaments readily on sites of single stranded DNA (ssDNA). In vitro filament formation is magnesium and ATP dependent, and requires a concentration of RAD51 protein of approximately 250 nM. This reaction also demonstrates cooperativity, such that a threshold level of RAD51 binding to ssDNA will stimulate further filament formation (Zaitseva et al., 1999; Shinohara et al., 1992). One mechanism by which cells can up-regulate filament formation is over-expression of RAD51 protein. RAD51 is over-expressed in a number of human cancer cell lines (Raderschall et al., 2002; Russell et al., 2003; Hansen et al., 2003) and human tumors (Maacke et al., 2000a; Maacke et al., 2000b; Han et al., 2002; Henning and Sturzbecher 2003; Yoshikawa et al., 2000; Qiao et al., 2005). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments have shown that the RAD51 gene is not amplified. Other experiments have demonstrated that RAD51 protein half-life is normal in tumor cells. Taken together, this suggests that the increased protein levels result from transcriptional up-regulation (Raderschall et al., 2002). There are also data to suggest that RAD51 over-expression can compensate for loss of RAD51 paralog proteins, thus by-passing the need for a mediator protein that would have otherwise been rate limiting (Takata et al., 2001). RAD51 over-expression is particularly dramatic in the case of pancreatic cancer. Han et al. (2002) performed a cDNA microarray analysis comparing pancreatic cancer cells lines to normal pancreatic cells; RAD51 was among the 30 most over-expressed genes in this analysis. This result was confirmed with an immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showing strong RAD51 staining in 71.8% of malignant pancreatic tumors in humans (Han et al., 2002). A similar study of 47 human pancreatic tumor tissue specimens showed RAD51 overexpression in 66% of tumors (Maacke et al., 2000b). In fact, RAD51 overexpression is so great that 7% of pancreatic cancer patients generate auto-antibodies to RAD51, which can be detected in their sera (Maacke et al., 2002). A functional analysis using a system of inducible RAD51 overexpression in pancreatic cells directly showed that overexpression confers resistance to DSB's (Maacke et al., 2000b). A growing body of literature agrees with this finding, suggesting that high RAD51 protein expression levels can modulate the resistance of cancer cells to IR (ionizing radiation) and some chemotherapeutic drugs. B. HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION AND BRCA1 MUTATIONS The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 plays an important role in HR (Moynahan et al., 2001). It has been speculated that BRCA2 protein either chaperones RAD51 monomers, that it serves as mediator for RAD51 filament assembly at sites of DNA damage, and/or that it acts to stabilize existing filaments. A recent report suggested that RAD51 directly interacts with a C-terminal region of BRCA2 protein (Esashi et al., 2005). RAD51 is also known to directly bind six of the eight conserved BRC repeats within human BRCA2 (Chen et al., 1998; Wong et al., 1997). Crystal structure data have been generated using a fusion protein containing BRC4 covalently linked to the C-terminal core domain of RAD51. This and other studies have demonstrated that BRC repeats share a conserved motif that is thought to mimic a primary interface used in RAD51 polymerization (Shin et al., 2003; Pellegrini et al., 2002). Various BRC peptides have been shown capable of blocking self-association by RAD51 monomers, inhibiting RAD51 filament formation, and sensitizing cells to DNA damage (Chen et al., 1999; Davies et al., 2001; Yuan et al., 1999). For example Chen et. al. reported that conditional expression of wild-type BRC4 resulted in hypersensitivity to irradiation and an inability to form radiation-induced RAD51 foci in breast cancer cells (Chen et al., 1999). Preliminary tumor studies by the present inventors focused on HR by modulating the RAD51 paralog protein XRCC3. Using xenograft tumors grown in nude mice, cisplatin treatment was found to produce regression and cure of HR-deficient xenograft tumors using a treatment schedule that has little effect of HR-competent tumors. Similarly, the HR-deficient tumors were sensitive to relatively low doses of ionizing radiation, compared to HR-competent tumors. Other clinical studies suggest that, like XRCC3-deficient tumors, HR-deficient human tumors (due to BRCA1-mutation) are especially susceptible to DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents (Porter et al., 1994; Rubin et al., 1996). Tanaka and colleagues found that in a group ovarian cancer patients receiving cisplatin treatment, those defective for BRCA1 had a five-year survival of 79% while patients in the control group had a five-year survival of only 30% (Alda et al., 1998). Similarly, Marcus et al. (1996) found that BRCA1-defective women with breast cancer had relatively favorable outcomes, despite having tumors with higher grade and higher S-phase fraction. Thus, deficiencies of HR may sensitize tumor cells to some chemotherapy drugs and IR, providing evidence that pharmacologic inhibitors of HR are likely to improve the clinical efficacy of cancer treatments.

For example, a compound with a substituent of —O or —N is to be understood to be —OH or —NH2, respectively. Any genus, subgenus, or specific compound discussed herein is specifically contemplated as being excluded from any embodiment described herein. Compounds described herein may be prepared synthetically using conventional organic chemistry methods known to those of skill in the art and/or are commercially available (e.g., ChemBridge Co., San Diego, Calif.). The claimed invention is also intended to encompass salts of any of the compounds of the present invention. The term “salt(s)” as used herein, is understood as being acidic and/or basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids and bases. Zwitterions (internal or inner salts) are understood as being included within the term “salt(s)” as used herein, as are quaternary ammonium salts such as alkylammonium salts. Nontoxic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are preferred, although other salts may be useful, as for example in isolation or purification steps during synthesis. Salts include, but are not limited to, sodium, lithium, potassium, amines, tartrates, citrates, hydrohalides, phosphates and the like. A salt may be a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, for example. Thus, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the present invention are contemplated. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts,” as used herein, refers to salts of compounds of this invention that are substantially non-toxic to living organisms. Typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of a compound of this invention with an inorganic or organic acid, or an organic base, depending on the substituents present on the compounds of the invention. Non-limiting examples of inorganic acids which may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts include: hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, phosphorous acid and the like. Examples of organic acids which may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts include: aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, such as oxalic acid, carbonic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, phenyl-heteroatom-substituted alkanoic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfuric acids and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts prepared from inorganic or organic acids thus include hydrochloride, hydrobromide, nitrate, sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, hydroiodide, hydrofluoride, acetate, propionate, formate, oxalate, citrate, lactate, p-toluenesulfonate, methanesulfonate, maleate, and the like. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be formed by reacting the agents of the invention with an organic base such as methylamine, ethylamine, ethanolamine, lysine, ornithine and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the salts formed between carboxylate or sulfonate groups found on some of the compounds of this invention and inorganic cations, such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, or calcium, or such organic cations as isopropylammonium, trimethylammonium, tetramethylammonium, and imidazolium. Derivatives of compounds of the present invention are also contemplated. In certain aspects, “derivative” refers to a chemically modified compound that still retains the desired effects of the compound prior to the chemical modification. Such derivatives may have the addition, removal, or substitution of one or more chemical moieties on the parent molecule. Non-limiting examples of the types modifications that can be made to the compounds and structures disclosed herein include the addition or removal of lower alkanes such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, or substituted lower alkanes such as hydroxymethyl or aminomethyl groups; carboxyl groups and carbonyl groups; hydroxyls; nitro, amino, amide, and azo groups; sulfate, sulfonate, sulfono, sulfhydryl, sulfonyl, sulfoxido, phosphate, phosphono, phosphoryl groups, and halide substituents. Additional modifications can include an addition or a deletion of one or more atoms of the atomic framework, for example, substitution of an ethyl by a propyl; substitution of a phenyl by a larger or smaller aromatic group. Alternatively, in a cyclic or bicyclic structure, heteroatoms such as N, S, or O can be substituted into the structure instead of a carbon atom. Compounds employed in methods of the invention may contain one or more asymmetrically-substituted carbon or nitrogen atoms, and may be isolated in optically active or racemic form. Thus, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic form, epimeric form, and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. Compounds may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. In some embodiments, a single diastereomer is obtained. The chiral centers of the compounds of the present invention can have the S- or the R-configuration, as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. Compounds may be of the D- or L-form, for example. It is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms. For example, mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated by standard techniques including, but not limited to, resolution of racemic form, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral chromatography, preferential salt formation, recrystallization, and the like, or by chiral synthesis either from chiral starting materials or by deliberate synthesis of target chiral centers. In addition, atoms making up the compounds of the present invention are intended to include all isotopic forms of such atoms. Isotopes, as used herein, include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium, and isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C. As noted above, compounds of the present invention may exist in prodrug form. As used herein, “prodrug” is intended to include any covalently bonded carriers which release the active parent drug or compounds that are metabolized in vivo to an active drug or other compounds employed in the methods of the invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals (e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc.), the compounds employed in some methods of the invention may, if desired, be delivered in prodrug form. Thus, the invention contemplates prodrugs of compounds of the present invention as well as methods of delivering prodrugs. Prodrugs of the compounds employed in the invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Accordingly, prodrugs include, for example, compounds described herein in which a hydroxy, amino, or carboxy group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug is administered to a subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, free amino, or carboxylic acid, respectively. Other examples include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate, and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups; and alkyl, carbocyclic, aryl, and alkylaryl esters such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, cyclopropyl, phenyl, benzyl, and phenethyl esters, and the like. It should be recognized that the particular anion or cation forming a part of any salt of this invention is not critical, so long as the salt, as a whole, is pharmacologically acceptable. Additional examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and their methods of preparation and use are presented in Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use (2002), which is incorporated herein by reference. E. PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION THEREOF 1. Pharmaceutical Formulations and Routes of Administration Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of one or more candidate substance or additional agent dissolved or dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The phrases “pharmaceutical or pharmacologically acceptable” refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to an animal, such as, for example, a human, as appropriate. The preparation of a pharmaceutical composition that contains at least one candidate substance or additional active ingredient will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure, as exemplified by Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. Mack Printing Company, 1990, incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, for animal (e.g., human) administration, it will be understood that preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biological Standards. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, surfactants, antioxidants, preservatives (e.g., antibacterial agents, antifungal agents), isotonic agents, absorption delaying agents, salts, preservatives, drugs, drug stabilizers, gels, binders, excipients, disintegration agents, lubricants, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, dyes, such like materials and combinations thereof, as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. Mack Printing Company, 1990, pp. 1289-1329). Except insofar as any conventional carrier is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions is contemplated. The compounds of the invention may comprise different types of carriers depending on whether it is to be administered in solid, liquid or aerosol form, and whether it need to be sterile for such routes of administration as injection. The present invention can be administered intravenously, intradermally, intraarterially, intraperitoneally, intralesionally, intracranially, intraarticularly, intraprostaticaly, intrapleurally, intratracheally, intranasally, intravitreally, intravaginally, intrarectally, topically, intratumorally, intramuscularly, systemically, subcutaneously, subconjunctival, intravesicularlly, mucosally, intrapericardially, intraumbilically, intraocularally, orally, locally, via inhalation (e.g., aerosol inhalation), via injection, via infusion, via continuous infusion, via localized perfusion bathing target cells directly, via a catheter, via a lavage, in cremes, in lipid compositions (e.g., liposomes), or by other method or any combination of the foregoing as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1990). The actual dosage amount of a composition of the present invention administered to an animal patient can be determined by physical and physiological factors such as body weight, severity of condition, the type of disease being treated, previous or concurrent therapeutic interventions, idiopathy of the patient and on the route of administration. The practitioner responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the concentration of active ingredient(s) in a composition and appropriate dose(s) for the individual subject. In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions may comprise, for example, at least about 0.1% of a compound of the present invention. In other embodiments, the compound may comprise between about 2% to about 75% of the weight of the unit, or between about 25% to about 60%, for example, and any range derivable therein. In other non-limiting examples, a dose may also comprise from about 1 microgram/kg/body weight, about 5 microgram/kg/body weight, about 10 microgram/kg/body weight, about 50 microgram/kg/body weight, about 100 microgram/kg/body weight, about 200 microgram/kg/body weight, about 350 microgram/kg/body weight, about 500 microgram/kg/body weight, about 1 milligram/kg/body weight, about 5 milligram/kg/body weight, about 10 milligram/kg/body weight, about 50 milligram/kg/body weight, about 100 milligram/kg/body weight, about 200 milligram/kg/body weight, about 350 milligram/kg/body weight, about 500 milligram/kg/body weight, to about 1000 mg/kg/body weight or more per administration, and any range derivable therein.

In any case, the composition may comprise various antioxidants to retard oxidation of one or more component. Additionally, the prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by preservatives such as various antibacterial and antifungal agents, including but not limited to parabens (e.g., methylparabens, propylparabens), chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, or combinations thereof. The candidate substance may be formulated into a composition in a free base, neutral or salt form. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, include the acid addition salts, e.g., those formed with the free amino groups of a proteinaceous composition, or which are formed with inorganic acids such as for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric or mandelic acid. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium or ferric hydroxides; or such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine, or procaine. In embodiments where the composition is in a liquid form, a carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium comprising but not limited to, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, etc.), lipids (e.g., triglycerides, vegetable oils, liposomes) and combinations thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin; by the maintenance of the required particle size by dispersion in carriers such as, for example liquid polyol or lipids; by the use of surfactants such as, for example hydroxypropylcellulose; or combinations thereof such methods. It may be preferable to include isotonic agents, such as, for example, sugars, sodium chloride or combinations thereof. In other embodiments, one may use eye drops, nasal solutions or sprays, aerosols or inhalants. Such compositions are generally designed to be compatible with the target tissue type. In a non-limiting example, nasal solutions are usually aqueous solutions designed to be administered to the nasal passages in drops or sprays. Nasal solutions are prepared so that they are similar in many respects to nasal secretions, so that normal ciliary action is maintained. Thus, in certain embodiments the aqueous nasal solutions usually are isotonic or slightly buffered to maintain a pH of about 5.5 to about 6.5. In addition, antimicrobial preservatives, similar to those used in ophthalmic preparations, drugs, or appropriate drug stabilizers, if required, may be included in the formulation. For example, various commercial nasal preparations are known and include drugs such as antibiotics or antihistamines. In certain embodiments the candidate substance is prepared for administration by such routes as oral ingestion. In these embodiments, the solid composition may comprise, for example, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, capsules (e.g., hard or soft shelled gelatin capsules), sustained release formulations, buccal compositions, troches, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, or combinations thereof. Oral compositions may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. In certain embodiments, carriers for oral administration comprise inert diluents, assimilable edible carriers or combinations thereof. In other aspects of the invention, the oral composition may be prepared as a syrup or elixir. A syrup or elixir, and may comprise, for example, at least one active agent, a sweetening agent, a preservative, a flavoring agent, a dye, a preservative, or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments an oral composition may comprise one or more binders, excipients, disintegration agents, lubricants, flavoring agents, and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, a composition may comprise one or more of the following: a binder, such as, for example, gum tragacanth, acacia, cornstarch, gelatin or combinations thereof; an excipient, such as, for example, dicalcium phosphate, mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate or combinations thereof; a disintegrating agent, such as, for example, corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid or combinations thereof; a lubricant, such as, for example, magnesium stearate; a sweetening agent, such as, for example, sucrose, lactose, saccharin or combinations thereof; a flavoring agent, such as, for example peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavoring, orange flavoring, etc.; or combinations thereof the foregoing. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, carriers such as a liquid carrier. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar, or both. Additional formulations which are suitable for other modes of administration include suppositories. Suppositories are solid dosage forms of various weights and shapes, usually medicated, for insertion into the rectum, vagina, or urethra. After insertion, suppositories soften, melt or dissolve in the cavity fluids. In general, for suppositories, traditional carriers may include, for example, polyalkylene glycols, triglycerides, or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, suppositories may be formed from mixtures containing, for example, the active ingredient in the range of about 0.5% to about 10%, and preferably about 1% to about 2%. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and/or the other ingredients. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, suspensions or emulsion, certain methods of preparation may include vacuum-drying or freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered liquid medium thereof. The liquid medium should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic prior to injection with sufficient saline or glucose. The preparation of highly concentrated compositions for direct injection is also contemplated, where the use of DMSO as solvent is envisioned to result in extremely rapid penetration, delivering high concentrations of the active agents to a small area. The composition must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage, and preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. It will be appreciated that endotoxin contamination should be kept minimally at a safe level, for example, less that 0.5 ng/mg protein. In particular embodiments, prolonged absorption of an injectable composition can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, such as, for example, aluminum monostearate, gelatin, or combinations thereof 2. Combination Therapy In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the RAD51 modulators of the invention may be used in conjunction with DNA damaging agents as part of a treatment regimen. This process may involve contacting the cell(s) with the agents at the same time or within a period of time wherein separate administration of the agents produces a desired therapeutic benefit. This may be achieved by contacting the cell, tissue or organism with a single composition or pharmacological formulation that includes two or more agents, or by contacting the cell with two or more distinct compositions or formulations, wherein one composition includes one agent and the other includes another. Compounds discussed herein may precede, be co-current with and/or follow the other agents by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks. In embodiments where the agents are applied separately to a cell, tissue or organism, one would generally ensure that a significant period of time did not expire between the time of each delivery, such that the agents would still be able to exert an advantageously combined effect on the cell, tissue or organism. For example, in such instances, it is contemplated that one may contact the cell, tissue or organism with two, three, four or more modalities substantially simultaneously (i.e., within less than about a minute) as the candidate substance. In other aspects, one or more DNA damaging agents may be administered or provided within 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 21 hours, 22 hours, 22 hours, 23 hours, 24 hours, 25 hours, 26 hours, 27 hours, 28 hours, 29 hours, 30 hours, 31 hours, 32 hours, 33 hours, 34 hours, 35 hours, 36 hours, 37 hours, 38 hours, 39 hours, 40 hours, 41 hours, 42 hours, 43 hours, 44 hours, 45 hours, 46 hours, 47 hours, 48 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 8 days, 9 days, 10 days, 11 days, 12 days, 13 days, 14 days, 15 days, 16 days, 17 days, 18 days, 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, or 8 weeks or more, and any range derivable therein, prior to and/or after administering the RAD51 modulator. Various combination regimens of the agents may be employed. Non-limiting examples of such combinations are shown below, wherein a compound of the present invention is “A” and a second agent, such as a DNA damaging agent, is “B”: A/B/A B/A/B B/B/A A/A/B A/B/B B/A/A A/B/B/B B/A/B/B B/B/B/A B/B/A/B A/A/B/B A/B/A/B A/B/B/A B/B/A/A B/A/B/A B/A/A/B A/A/A/B B/A/A/A A/B/A/A A/A/B/A In some embodiments, more than one course of therapy may be employed. It is contemplated that multiple courses may be implemented. In certain embodiments, a patient may have previously undergone radiation or chemotherapy for a cancer that turns out to be chemotherapy- or radiation-resistant. Alternatively, a patient may have a recurring cancer that is to be treated with a DNA damaging agent. F.

It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Example 1 Fluorescence Polarization and Cell-Based Assays The synthesized compounds were tested for biological activity in a two-stage manner. They were first evaluated for their ability to inhibit the binding of human RAD51 protein to ssDNA. This primary assay utilizes a fluorescence polarization (FP) based method that involves incubation of purified RAD51 protein with oligonucleotides, which are end-labeled with a fluorescent tag. The binding of RAD51 to this substrate ssDNA is quantified as a function of polarization of light emitted by the fluorescent tag. Chemical analogs were then tested further using secondary cell-based assays. Since cell lethality from RI-1 is thought to be a function of cellular RAD51 inhibition for RI-1, LD50 values were used as a surrogate measurement of in vivo activity against RAD51 in cells. This cell-based assay was also simultaneously utilized to evaluate for compound-induced sensitization of cells to the cross-linking chemotherapeutic drug MMC, thereby confirming that toxic effects are secondary to HR inhibition. Example 2 RI-2 Inhibits HR DNA Repair and Sensitizes Cells to Cross-Linking Chemotherapy To demonstrate that RI-2 is capable of gaining intracellular access and specifically inhibiting RAD51 in cells, the compound was tested in human cells that contain integrated reporter constructs that quantify the efficiency of specific DNA repair pathways. The reporter construct that measures HR repair consists of two non-functional copies of green fluorescence protein (GFP), one of which is interrupted by an I-SceI endonuclease site. Induction of a DNA break at the I-SceI site can lead to repair by homologous gene conversion that generates a functional copy of GFP (Pierce et al., 1999). A second parallel assay makes use of cells that contain a different reporter that measures single-strand annealing (SSA), which is an alternative method of re-ligating DNA when HR cannot be completed. SSA efficiency is known to be elevated in situations where RAD51 function has been disrupted (Mansour et al., 2008, Stark et al., 2004, and Bennardo et al., 2008). Consistent with our prior report (Budke et al., 2012), incubation of cells with 20 μM RI-1 led to an inhibition of HR and a stimulation of SSA (FIG. 3). RI-2 at 60 μM was capable of generating very similar effects. This suggests that RI-2 can indeed generate specific inhibition of RAD51 in cells, even though this compound lacks the Michael acceptor reactivity of RI-1. Example 3 DNA Binding Assay Human RAD51 protein was prepared as previously described (Budke et al., 2012). RAD51 was incubated with 100 nM (nucleotide concentration) of a 45-mer oligo-dT 5′ Alexa 488 end-labeled substrate. Binding was measured as a function of fluorescence polarization (FP) of the Alexa 488 tag. 50 μl reactions were performed in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 30 mM NaCl, 2% glycerol, 250 μM BSA, and 4% DMSO. Black polystyrene flat-bottom 384-well reaction plates were read using a Tecan Infinite F200 Pro plate reader, equipped with 485(20)/535(25) FP filters. For experiments used to determine IC50 values, RAD51 concentrations (typically 190-290 nM) were selected to generate FP signal of 50-80% maximum in the absence of any inhibitory compound. Reported IC50 values represent the mean result of at least three replicate wells, and reported errors connote standard deviation. Example 4 DNA Binding Competition Assays Using a previously described method, human RAD51 protein was prepared with an N-terminal biotin tag (Jayathilaka et al., 2008). The tag is linked to the protein by a peptide sequence recognized by the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease. Tagged RAD51 was immobilized on streptavidin-conjugated polyacrylamide beads (Ultralink, Pierce) and incubated for 30 min at 37° C. with candidate compounds in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mM NaCl, 2% glycerol, 4% DMSO. The polyacrylamide beads were then washed twice with ice-cold wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl) containing 4% DMSO and then once with ice-cold wash buffer without DMSO. RAD51 protein was subsequently eluted from beads with TEV protease (gift from Phoebe Rice) and analyzed for DNA binding activity using the above FP-based DNA binding assay. Example 5 Cell Toxicity Assays HEK293 cells were plated into 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 300 cells per well in the presence or absence of 50 nM MMC (Ben Venue Laboratories) for 24 hours at 37° C., 5% CO2. Media was subsequently replaced with fresh media containing 0.5% DMSO plus a candidate compound for an additional 24 hours. Compounds were then removed, and cultures were allowed to grow to a 50-70% confluence. Average survival from at least three replicates was measured using CellGlo reagent (Promega) or via a previously described sulforhodamine B method (Jayathilaka et al., 2008). Compounds were deemed successful in sensitizing cells to MMC if they generated significantly greater toxicity in the presence of MMC relative to the absence of MMC. Specifically, sensitization was scored as a “+” when non-overlapping standard errors were observed for at least two pairs of compound doses. Example 6 Quantification of HR and SSA Efficiencies in Cells HEK293 cells stably transfected with the DR-GFP or SA-GFP reporters were provided by Jeremy Stark (Bennardo et al., 2008). 0.5-1.0×107 cells at 80% confluence were electroporated with 30-60 μg pCβASce (or pCAGGS) in 4 mm cuvettes, using the following settings: 240-350 V, 975 μF. Cells were transferred into the appropriate complete growth medium and allowed to grow for 24 hours in the presence or absence of a candidate compound. Compounds were removed and cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours in normal media, following which they were analyzed with a Becton-Dickinson FACScan. Live cells were collected based on size/complexity and 7-aminoactinomycyin D (7-AAD) exclusion. The fraction of live cells exhibiting GFP positivity is displayed, and error bars denote standard error. Example 7 Glutathione Stability Experiments Compound (10 mg) and L-glutathione (5 mol equiv) were placed in a round-bottomed flask under argon and dissolved in DMSO (1 mL). The reaction was heated to 37° C. and stirred. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed every hour, including one at t=0 min, and analyzed by HPLC. Ratio of substrate and glutathione adduct was recorded and the expected glutathione adduct was then identified using mass spectrometry Example 8 General Information for Synthetic Procedures 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker spectrometer with TMS as an internal standard.
