Body shaping garment Field of the invention [0001] This invention relates to a body shaping garment, and more particularly to an improved body shaping and smoothing garment which facilitates targeted body shaping and support, while also enabling provision of a low back profile and good bust support where this is desired. Background of the Invention [0002] Psychometric testing indicates that physical attraction between people is influenced by perceptions of body symmetry and proportion. Just as a face more likely to be noticed and judged beautiful if in certain proportions and symmetry, scientists believe that bodies perceived to be in certain proportions are more likely to considered healthy and attractive. [0003] The female body usually inflects inward towards the waist around the middle of the abdomen between the costal margins and the pelvic crests. [0004] The waist is typically smaller than the bust and hips, unless there is a high proportion of body fat distributed around the waist. How much the bust or hips inflect inward, towards the waist determines the structural shape proportions and silhouette and influences perceptions of attractiveness. [0005] The hourglass shape is the Western conception of the "ideal" or usual female shape, against which other shapes are compared. In the hourglass shape the hip and bust are almost of equal size with a narrow waist. For example, body fat distribution tends to be around both the upper body and lower body. This body type enlarges the arms, chest, hips, and rear before other parts, such as the waist and upper abdomen. A study of over 6,000 women carried out by researchers at the North Carolina State University around 2005 found that in practice only about 8% of women have the hourglass shape naturally. The British Association of Model Agents (AMA) says that female models should be around 34-24-34 in (86-60-86 cm) and at least 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) tall. [0006] The waist-hip ratio ("WHR") is a person's waist measurement divided by the hip measurement. Notwithstanding wide cultural differences in preferences for female build, scientists have discovered that the waist-hip ratio of any build is very strongly correlated to the perception of attractiveness across all cultures. Women with a 0.7 WHR (waist circumference that is 70% of the hip circumference) are usually rated as more attractive by men from European cultures. Such diverse European beauty icons as Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, and the Venus de Milo all have ratios around 0.7. In other cultures, preferences vary, ranging from 0.6 in China to 0.8 or 0.9 in parts of South America and Africa and divergent preferences based on ethnicity, rather than nationality, have also been noted. WHR has been found to be a more efficient predictor of mortality in older people than waist circumference or body mass index (BMI). [0007] The WHR for healthy, pre-menopausal women is generally between 0.67 and 0.80, but for men it is usually between 0.85 and 0.95. WHR has been shown to be a reliable morphological indicator of the levels of sex hormones, and also the risk of major diseases, reproductive potential, and premature mortality. Generally, for a female in a western culture, a WHR of 7.0 is considered very attractive while anything more than an 8.0 WHR is considered as possibly unhealthy if it is indeed fat and not muscle. [0008] The preferred breast to hip ratio, ("BHR") it usually is about the same ratio as the WHR. [0009] For the foregoing reasons, there is a high demand for garments that are useful for improving perceived body shape and such garments are manufactured commercially en mass, as well as individually fitted for use with expensive fashion garments. [0010] Garments for use in body shaping have a long history. For example, a "corset" is a garment worn to mould and shape the torso into a desired shape for aesthetic or medical purposes (either for the duration of wearing it, or with a more lasting effect). Both men and women are known to wear corsets, though women are more common wearers. [001 1] Although now worn most frequently by women for fashionable purposes, there have been periods in history when corsets have been worn by men for fashion purposes. [0012] Corsets will herein be described primarily with reference to female attire, but references herein to body shaping garments should not be construed as limited to those intended for female apparel, or for fashion, or as excluding corsets intended for medical use. [0013] In the Victorian era, corsets were worn as undergarments by many women, and these consisted of vertically seamed substantially rectilinear panels of a flexible material (for example cloth, particularly coutil, or leather, or even canvas) stiffened with bone (also called ribs, boning or stays) inserted into channels in the cloth or leather. The purpose of 18th century stays was to support the bust, confer the then fashionable conical shape while drawing the shoulders back. At this time, the eyelets were reinforced with stitches, and were not placed across from one another, but staggered. This allowed the stays to be spiral laced. One end of the stay lace was inserted and knotted in the bottom eyelet, the other end being wound through the stays' eyelets and tightened on the top. In the 19th century, bones of elephant, moose, and whale were favoured for the boning. Featherbone was used as a less expensive substitute for whalebone and was constructed from flattened strips of goose quill woven together with yarn to form a long strip. Plastic is now the most commonly used material for lightweight corsets and the majority of poor quality corsets, whereas spring or spiral steel is preferred for stronger corsets and also generally for better quality corsets. Other materials used in the past for boning include ivory, wood, and cane. (By contrast, a girdle is usually made of elasticized fabric, without boning). A corset when worn is a tubular garment wrapped around the torso, the diameter of which is usually at a minimum at or near the waist of the wearer, the primary purpose of which is to alter the proportions of the wearer to a greater or lesser extent. [0014] In the Victorian era Corsets were held together by lacing, usually (though not always) at the back. Corsets were provided with lacing tightened to enable the waist and/or upper torso of the wearer to be reduced in circumference (by displacement of muscle and or adipose tissue) and in some cases to provide bust support or shaping. Historically, during some periods it was fashionable to use corsets to approximate an hourglass silhouette with extreme body distortion while in other periods it was fashionable to try to achieve other body shapes. Tightening or loosening a corset lacing produced corresponding changes in the firmness of the corset. Depending on the desired effect and time period, corsets were laced from the top down, from the bottom up, or both up from the bottom and down from the top, using two laces that meet in the middle. It was difficult, although not impossible, for a back-laced corset-wearer to do his or her own lacing. In the Victorian heyday of corsets, a well-to-do woman's corset laces would be tightened by her maid and a gentleman's by his valet. However, Victorian corsets also had a buttoned or hooked front opening called a "busk". If the corset was worn loosely, it was possible to leave the lacing as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening (if the corset is worn snugly, this method will damage the busk if the lacing is not significantly loosened beforehand). Self-lacing is also almost impossible with tight lacing, which strives for the utmost possible reduction of the waist. [0015] Modern corsets are predominantly fabricated in cloth fabric of varying weights and properties. By cloth the definition of that would be a woven fabrication or cutting of components out of a cloth fabric which are then stitched together. These corsets have fasteners at a front vertical seam and may utilize belts and buckles, zippers, hook and eye fasteners, and the like, in place of draw strings. During manufacture, in all cases the tubular body shape is formed from a plurality of long thin substantially rectangular vertically extending panels which were formed at different positions on the torso, or pinched or gusseted and seamed vertically along lines substantially parallel with the tubular axis of the garment so as to form a desired waisted tubular shape. The boning channels were then stitched either side of the vertical seams and the lacing grommets eyelets (or other fastenings) inserted along the line of the opening. [0016] The corset fell from fashion in the 1920s in Europe and America, being replaced by girdles and elastic brassieres, but survived as an article of costume. Originally an item of lingerie, the corset has become a popular item of outerwear in the fetish, BDSM and "goth" subcultures. [0017] Constructed of elasticized fabric and sometimes fastened with hook and eye closures, the modern girdle is also designed to enhance a woman's figure. Most open-bottom girdles extend from the waist to the upper thighs. In the 1960s, these models fell from favor and were to a great extent replaced by the panty girdle. The panty girdle resembles a tight pair of athletic shorts. Both models of girdles may optionally include suspender clips to hold up stockings. Modern girdles are either made from elastic fabric or have substantial elastic panels, for example front or rear panels, usually of a square or diamond shape. [0018] Whereas a "corset" deals primarily with the waist, a "girdle" deals primarily with the buttocks. There is no clear-cut division between the two garments, but the corset will usually stop at the top of the hip, while a girdle will cover the whole of the buttocks. [0019] Generally, a corset was always constructed from rigid fabric, and was adjusted by lacing, whereas a girdle was constructed from elastic fabric, and was often strongly elastic. A girdle is a garment designed to smooth and flatten the wearer's tummy and buttocks. At the minimum it will extend from the wearers waist to just below her buttocks. It can extend significantly above a woman's waist, though if it covers her breasts it becomes a "corselet". Longer girdles, which come significantly below the buttocks, have been introduced on occasions, but they have never become popular, probably because they seriously interfere with the wearer's freedom of movement. [0020] As garments have become more revealing, it has created a demand for a lightweight, supportive garment that covers as little of the wearer's body as possible, whilst still offering substantial support by way of seams and stretch fabric in the breast area and body shaping through the torso. [0021] Modern girdles are either made entirely from elastic fabric, or have substantial elastic panels. Classic girdles often had a rigid front panel, to help flatten the tummy, and a back panel made from down stretch satin elastic fabric. This would stretch downwards, to minimize the strain on the back suspenders (garters) when the wearer was sitting down, but could not stretch sideways so that the buttocks would be flattened as much as possible. [0022] There is a fundamental difference between a laced girdle or corset, and an elastic one, in that if one puts on a corset, laced moderately tightly, and pulls one's tummy in, one can pull it away from the corset, so that the latter is not imposing any force on the tummy. However if one tries to push one's tummy out, one can't, because the corset is an immovable object. So the corset is not as uncomfortable as one might imagine, because one can always get relief from the pressure by holding one's tummy in. It may even encourage one to do so. On the other hand, a modern elastic girdle always exerts the same force on one's tummy, whether one pulls it in or pushes it out, so one can't get any relief from it. And it can't reduce one's waist by anything like the same amount, because it would have to be impossibly tight, all the time, to do so. [0023] The prior art includes U.S. Pat. No. 2,381 ,953 which discloses a construction in which a panty girdle has a pair of rear panels which are extended over the buttocks of the wearer, and the meeting edges of the panels are detachably interconnected by a slide fastener. U.S. Pat. No. 2,444,829 discloses a comparable structure applied to a regular girdle, and includes a slide fastener-closed rear opening. U.S. Pat. No. 2,896,633 discloses a girdle in which a crotch piece is droppable by opening a slide fastener, the slide fastener being arranged in an arc so that it commences and terminates at the forward lower edge of the garment. European Pat. No. 1202642B1 discloses a strapless and backless device that can be worn with backless or revealing clothing and adheres to the skin with adhesive patches on tabs that are part of the design. US2005/0064790 discloses a foundation garment for use under low back or low cut clothes. However, while this garment can minimise foundation garment lines visible under the clothes, it provides only limited shaping at the waist region and relies for stability on tension between the straps and the brief region. It also offers minimal support for the bust as it has no point at which the garment is stabilized on the body other than via straps. [0024] During the late twenties and early thirties, body shaping garments were changing rapidly as new lightweight elastic fabrics became available, and knitting technology advanced. Girdles made from lightweight synthetic fabrics began to replace the previous rigid laced corsets and girdles. Corsets and laced girdles were usually put on by wrapping them around the body and then either hooking them together or lacing them up. So these were referred to as "Wrap-ons". Younger women generally chose a relatively lightweight garment which was knitted as a seamless tube on a circular knitting machine. These were generally put on by turning them inside out, and upside down, stepping into them and then rolling them up into the right position. They were called "Roll-ons", and a generation of women adopted this term as the general name for girdles, although they were relatively ineffective for body shaping. Although the original Roll-ons had no seams, the term soon came to be applied to any girdle which did not have a zip fastening, or other opening. More mature women wore a firmer elastic girdle with a zip fastening. They stepped into them to put them on, so they were known as "Step-ins". As with body stockings these, garments can be manufactured as a knitted tube, the diameter of which can be varied programmatically along the tubular axial direction, and the stretch of the fabric was either substantially uniform in both axial and circumferential directions or was preferentially in the circumferential direction. [0025] GB 2423234 (Marks and Spencer) describes a dress incorporating an undergarment made from Powermesh™ stretch fabrics disposed in corset-like vertical panels, but having a horizontally disposed elastic waist seam. This undergarment formed a lining of the outer garment dress to which it was attached at a neck or torso opening of the dress. The dress had an open seam extending from the neck or torso opening which was closeable by a zipper or other fastening means. The undergarment or lining was attached to the outer layer (i.e. the dress) at opposite edges of the open seam, so that it was also simultaneously closed when the dress was closed with the zipper or fasting means. [0026] Body shaping garments in the prior art have suffered from various disadvantages. Corsets can be effective at changing the WHR but require lacing and are difficult to put on. Corsets tend to be uncomfortable to wear as they are made of unyielding material and there is nowhere for displaced body fat to be accommodated. Elastic garments redistribute body mass with less focus on the waist. [0027] In relation to the increased need for low back or backless undergarments to wear with more revealing fashion items, garments in the prior art have generally been limited in two elements: the support they offer the wearers bust is drastically reduced seeking to offer body shaping simultaneously the garments that do offer support underpin it to the shoulder of the wearer, or more rigid/supportive designs have not offered a truly backless garment, with the upper edge of the garment sitting between the mid back and waist of the wearer. [0028] Backless garments in the prior art have fallen into three main categories: 1 . Rigid, boned structures lacking an element of comfort and covering a large portion of the back and midriff in order to offer support at the bust 2. Unsubstantial breast panels affixed by various methods, straps or adhesive that do not offer the desired level of support to the wearer, or anchored to the shoulder by straps 3. All in one garments offering body shaping whilst covering a large area of the body, or lighweight stretch versions offering a lower cut back but no support to the bust of the wearer [0029] It is an object of the present invention to provide a body shaping garment that overcomes or at least ameliorates one or more of the above discussed disadvantages of the prior art or which offers a useful alternative. Brief Description of the Invention [0030] According to the invention there is provided a body shaping garment including a waist defining region in the form of a generally hollow tubular shape adapted to be worn around the waist of a wearer between the chest and the hips, the waist defining region comprising:- a circumferentially extending anchoring elastic waist portion; and an elasticised upper panel extending in a circumferential direction and having its lower edge abutting the waist portion, the panel having a shorter circumferential extent at its edge adjacent the waist portion than at its opposite edge, whereby the elastic waist portion is configured to apply a first compressive force to anchor the garment to a user's body, and the upper panel is configured to promote, in use, a generally conical shape which tapers in a direction from the chest towards the waist. [0031] In most preferred forms, the tubular waist region also includes: an elasticised lower panel extending in a circumferential direction and having its upper edge abutting the waist portion, the panel having a shorter circumferential extent at its edge adjacent the waist portion than at its opposite edge, whereby to promote, in use, a generally conical shape which tapers in a direction from the waist towards hip. [0032] Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of "including, but not limited to". [0033] Depending on the intended use and desired features of the garment, it may also include further lower portions that extend below the lower panel fashioned, for example, into a skirt or girdle, panties or brief, short or long leggings, hoods, or other possible configurations as required. Similarly, the garment may also include further upper portions extending above the upper panel fashioned into, for example, a bodice portion, with or without an integral bra formation, with optional straps adapted for various fastening configurations as may be desired and known in the art. [0034] It will be understood by those skilled in the art that as herein used directions such as "vertical", "horizontal", "up", "down" etc., refer to directions in a garment when worn by a standing person, and geometrical terms are used indicatively rather than precisely. For example, reference to the "axial direction " of a tubular garment includes directions more or less parallel with the tubular garment axis, and "circumferential" takes into account that articles are made from fabric and are not precisely circular in use or off the wearer etc. "Parallel" means more closely parallel than transverse, "vertical" means more closely upright than horizontal, etc. [0035] Preferably, the front portion of the upper and lower panels have a maximum width in an axial direction at the centre of the front of the garment thereby defining a convexly arcuate upper and lower peripheral profile when viewed from the front. [0036] In most embodiments the upper panel reduces to a minimum width at or toward the centre of the back of the garment. In most forms the waist portion will comprise a circumferentially extending band of generally constant width in the axial direction, preferably around 25-30mm wide. The rear portion of the lower panel in some embodiments may also have a maximum width at the centre of the back of the garment, but in others may be constant or even reduce to the centre, depending in part on the nature of the lowest portion of the garment below the lower panel. For example the configuration for a garment with integral leggings adjoining the lower panel, may be quite different from one with an integral skirt or girdle adjoining the lower panel. [0037] For embodiments specifically configured for use with low back clothing, the rear portion of the upper panel may not extend the full circumferential extent of the waist portion, but may taper quickly to termination points at the waist portion that are at, or circumferentially offset from, the centre of the back of the garment. This configuration utilises the effective combination of an anchoring waist region with an upper panel that promotes a generally conical form that tapers toward the waist and provides good support at the front below the bust or chest region, whilst enabling minimalisation of the vertical extent of the garment above the waist for use with plunging back fashion clothing. [0038] Preferably, the garment includes some form of non-slip material on the inner surface of at least the elasticised waist region to further assist in anchoring the garment to the body at the selected waist location. In one particularly preferred form silicone beading is used which functions to provide non-slip and elastic properties simultaneously. [0039] The inventive concept described above can be adapted into different forms to take advantage of the properties of various different materials and manufacturing methods. [0040] In a first range of embodiments designed to take advantage of different materials having quite different physical properties at different functional regions of the garment via a multi step fabrication technique such as a "cut and sew" manufacturing process, the waist portion is made of a material with limited elasticity in the axial direction so as to physically anchor the garment and hold in the waist, and the adjacent upper panel (and optional lower panel) is made from some form of stretch fabric having highly directional elasticity oriented so that the elasticity is directed in the axial direction rather than the circumferential direction. In this manner the elastic waist portion anchors the garment at waist, while the shaped adjacent panels circumferentially form the body into the desired conical form, while at the same time stretching axially to provide comfort when sitting or bending with minimal compromise to form. [0041] In one preferred form of this first embodiment the elastic waist portion is a heavy satin elastic over waist seam having a narrow dimension (e.g. 2 cm) in the axial direction and extending circumferentially about the wearers waist. The upper and lower elasticised panels are preferably made from a knitted stretch fabric having a highly directional elasticity in one direction, such as Powermesh™ and disposed, as discussed above, so that the high elasticity is directed in the axial direction rather than the circumferential direction. In highly preferred versions of this embodiment the components are attached to an overlying or underlying undergarment composed of a knitted stretch fabric such as Powermesh™ disposed with the high elasticity directed in a circumferential direction. [0042] For preference the upper and lower panels of the first embodiment extend circumferentially to the edges of an opening seam at the rear of the garment. However, in less preferred embodiments the panels may extend semi-circumferentially or arcuately at the front, and may be joined with panels of the same or a different fabric or of elastic to the edges of the opening seam. If preferred the opening seam need not be at the rear of the garment but may be elsewhere, e.g. at the front, or side. [0043] For preference the uppermost edge of the upper circumferential extending panel overlies (or underlies) a tubular bodice or busk covering some or the entire upper torso and which is also made from a stretch knit fabric and is joined therewith. This bodice or busk may be made from substantially rectilinear panels joined at seams extending generally parallel the axial direction to form a tubular portion of which the diameter changes from an open top towards the waist. For preference also, the lowermost edge of the lower front circumferential extending panel overlies (or underlies) and is joined with a tubular skirt, brief or leggings portion extending to the hip or beyond and which is also made from a stretch knit fabric. [0044] This skirt, brief or leggings may be made from substantially rectilinear panels joined at seams extending generally parallel the axial direction to form a tubular portion of which the diameter increases to the hip line and then diminishes. The panels may be joined with the bodice or skirt by any suitable means including fusion, sewing, adhesion or the like. [0045] In preferred forms the garment has an opening seam extending generally in the tubular axial direction, and closure means adapted to close said opening seam. [0046] The closure means may comprise any suitable fasteners, for example zip fasteners, hook and eye fasteners, press studs, buttons, fabric hook and eye fasteners such as Velcro™, or a combination of such like means. [0047] In some preferred forms of the garment according to the first embodiment, the circumferentially extending panels each stretch predominantly in a direction parallel to the axial direction of the tubular garment. . For preference the Instron Stretch (3.6kg) of the fabric warp is from 135% -165% more preferably 150%, while in the weft is from 80% to 1 10%, more preferably 95%. . For preference also the Modulus (40%) of the fabric is from 200-400 g more preferably 350g while in the weft is from 450 to 1050 g, more preferably 750g. [0048] In one preferred form the elastic waist portion has an elasticity of less than one third that of an adjacent semicircular panel. [0049] In one form the elasticised lower panel has an elasticity of less than one third an adjacent skirt panel when in overlying or underlying attachment. [0050] A second range of embodiments of the invention are designed to take advantage of advances in commercial knitting machinery which can create complex knitted garments where the properties of the knitted material can be varied at selected regions within the fabric or the garment during manufacture by dynamically altering the knit pattern and process at different locations on the garment as required. They are also particularly well suited to taking advantage of machinery capable of manufacturing seamless or predominantly seamless garments such is possible, for example, with many industrial body sized circular, warp, weft, or flat bed knitting machines. [0051] In such embodiments, the properties of the elastic waist portion and upper and lower panels, as well as adjacent further upper and lower garment components, are determined, for example, by varying a combination of the external dimensions of portions of the garment or fabric as well as the stitch structures , yarn composition and tension applied to the multiple thread feeds during knitting. For example stitch structures such as tucks, floats and false ribs, different yarn materials, and simple variation of stitch lengths, can all be used to modify the shape, elasticity, degree of support etc at different regions as is well known in the art. [0052] For garments made in accordance with the invention, the relevant inputs can be varied to achieve a garment with the desired preferred configuration to achieve garment with a waist portion, adjacent elasticised upper panel of the shape as claimed (plus optional lower panel also as claimed), and additional upper and/or lower body portions, whereby in use the maximum compressive force is exerted at the waist portion to anchor the garment, with the adjacent upper and lower panels exerting less compressive force than the waist portion, but more than any additional upper and/or lower portions, or at least majority sections thereof. In this manner, the garment can be positioned on the user with the waist portion located at the desired position, the compressive forces of the waist region in combination with the adjacent panels then acting to promote the desired 'hour glass" contouring. [0053] The relative compressive forces of the various regions of the garment, in particular the waist portion and adjacent upper and lower panels, can be achieved solely by processes forming part of the knitting process or may be achieved by processes separate from and subsequent to the knitting process. For example, the increased compressive force at the waist region can be achieved in part by post knitting application of a generally continuous seam of higher strength less extendible elastic material. In one particularly preferred form, this is achieved using an internally applied beading of a liquid silicon product which on setting has a rubberised texture so also serves to help hold the central region of the garment at the user's waist or desired waist location due to its non slip properties. In one embodiment the silicon or other elastic material is applied in a pattern such as a sinusoidal wave pattern, or in multiple bands, which in addition reduces the stretch of the waist panel and thus increases the compressive force applied. [0054] The garment may also include additional regions of varying support and compression within the further upper or lower regions that extend above or below the elasticised upper and lower panels. For example, the garment may include a further upper region with integrally formed bra cup regions, around which underwires can optionally be secured within a channel at the under bust positions a secondary operation to add support for the bust. The bra cup regions may have a lighter knit formation to accommodate breast bulk and/or include tailored regions for additional support where required. Similarly, garments including integral leggings may include portions around each buttock region of higher compression to provide lift and support. [0055] All embodiments incorporating a bodice portion with bra cup regions may include shoulder or neck straps that are fixed, removable, or reconfigurable. In other embodiments the bodice portion may be of a strapless configuration. [0056] According to a second aspect the invention consists of a garment according to the first aspect wherein the garment is an undergarment. [0057] According to a third aspect the invention consists of a body shaping garment according to the first or second aspect wherein said body shaping garment is attached within an outer garment having an opening seam provided with closure means; and wherein said body shaping garment has an opening seam the edges of which are attached at or adjacent to corresponding edges of the outer garment whereby the body shaping garment is substantially closed when the outer garment is closed by said closure means.

Description of preferred embodiments of the invention [0075] With reference to Figures 1 to 3 there is shown a first embodiment of a garment according to the invention designed to be made by a 'cut and sew" process. The embodiment depicted in figures 1 - 3 is intended to be worn by a female with the aim of altering her silhouette toward a WHR approximating 0.7. In fig 1 the outline of a wearer is indicated by a broken line 1. [0076] The first embodiment comprises a waist portion in the form of a band 2 made from a heavy satin elastic band intended to sit over the true waist of the wearer, although if it is desired to create an illusion of a raised or lowered waist line the band may be moved up or down by up to about 2.5 cm with respect to the wearers actual waist line. [0077] An elasticised preferably knitted upper panel 3 extends in a circumferential direction and has its lower edge 4 abutting the waist portion, panel 3 having a shorter circumferential extent at edge 4 adjacent the waist portion than at its opposite edge 5. Panel 3 forms, in use, a hollow tubular shape which tapers, narrowing in diameter in a downward direction (from the bust towards the waist). Panel 3 in the illustrated embodiment terminates circumferentially at the at opposed adjacent vertical opening seam edges 6,7 at the rear of the garment as shown in figure 2 which may be joined together closure means 8 such as a zipper, hook and eye fasteners, buttons, press studs or other closures or combinations thereof. [0078] An elasticised preferably knitted lower front panel 13 also extends in a circumferential direction and has its upper edge 14 abutting the waist portion 2. Panel 13 has a shorter circumferential extent at edge 14 adjacent waist portion 2 than at its opposite edge 15. Panel 13 forms, in use, a tubular shape which tapers, narrowing in diameter in an upward direction (from hip towards waist). Panel 13 also terminates circumferentially at the at opposed adjacent vertical opening seam edges 16,17 which align with edges 6,7 of panel 3 and which may be joined together by the same or different closure means 8. It will be understood that panels 3, 13 may be composed of a front portion and a rear portion and need not extend around the whole circumference. [0079] Importantly upper panel 3, and lower panel 13 are made from a preferably knitted fabric exhibiting elastic stretch in a direction parallel to the axial direction. Desirably the knitted fabric is made from Powermesh™, Powernet™, or the like. These are Polyelastane™ fiber knitted stretch fabrics. In a preferred embodiment Powernet™ E28 is used and is cut with stretch down the length of the panels so that in the garment there is limited stretch in the circumferential direction across the body, constraining the body proportions closer to the waist. For preference panels 3, 13 are each seamless. All edges have no seam allowance except at the vertical opening seam edges 6, 7 & 16, 17, to incorporate the closures. Elastane™ is also known as Spandex™ and is a synthetic fibre (77% polyamide/23% polyurethane-polyurea copolymer fibre) having exceptional elasticity. Elasticity is the physical property of a material that returns it to its original shape after an external force that made it deform is removed. Elastane™ is stronger and more durable than rubber, its major non-synthetic competitor. [0080] If desired, the embodiment of figures 1 to 3 could be manufactured as a waisted knitted tube, having stretch predominantly in the axial direction, and subsequently provided with an elastic waist portion by adding an elastic band at the waist or by incorporating a fabric or yarn equivalent waist restraint. [0081] Figures 4 to 7 show more highly preferred low back embodiments of the invention in the form of an undergarment also made in accordance with a "cut and sew" or multi stage manufacturing process where quite different materials can be advantageously used at different locations on the garment to best effect. Parts of the garment of figures 4 to 7 which correspond with parts of the embodiment of figures 1 to 3 are identified by corresponding numerals. The embodiments of all figures 4 to 7 have a satin elastic waist band 2, a knitted upper panel 3 extending in a circumferential direction and having its lower edge 4 abutting the waist portion, panel 3 having a shorter circumference at edge 4 adjacent the waist portion than at its opposite edge 5. All the embodiments excluding that shown in Figure 5 also include a knitted lower front panel 13 which extends in a circumferential direction and has its upper edge 14 abutting the waist portion 2, panel 13 having a shorter circumferential extent at edge 14 adjacent the waist portion than at its opposite edge 15. In these respects the garments are similar to the first embodiment. However the embodiments of figures 4 to 7 differ from the first embodiment in that they are provided with a bodice portion 1 1 underlying, or extending from, circular panel 3 and extending from the waist upwardly beyond edge 5 of the circular panel 3 to an opening 9 at or near the bust, the shoulders, or the neck. Bodice portion 1 1 is also made from Powernet™ fabric, but is made from vertically extending panels 10(a), 10(b) which are of a less elastic fabric constructed to form cup panels for bust support, which are held up by straps 10(c) which join it 10(b) at front and extend over shoulder to join at the back neckline. Also, the embodiments of figure 4 has a skirt portion 21 made from vertically extending panels 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(e), 20(f) seamed together at flat overlapping edges and extending downwardly from the waist underlying circular panel 13 and extending beyond edge 15 to the hips or to a lower opening 22. [0082] Importantly, the Powernet™ forming bodice portion 1 1 and skirt portion 21 is also cut with stretch predominantly down the length of the elongate vertical panels. The elasticity of the fabric used for bodice portion 1 1 , and skirt portion 21 is for preference greater than the elasticity of upper panel 3 or lower panel 13 and desirably is from 1.5 to 3 times greater, more preferably 2 times greater than the elasticity of upper panel 3 or lower panel 13. [0083] The embodiments of figures 4 to 7 have been described as made with separate bodice part 1 1 and a skirt 21 , leggings 24 or bodysuit brief 25 added to waist band 2 with upper and lower arcuate panels 3, 13 overlaid on the bodice 1 1 and skirt 21 or other further lower portion respectively. However one or both arcuate panels 3, 13 could underlie bodice 1 1 or skirt 21 respectively, or the bodice elements could be attached to and extend from the panels 3,13.. However, it is currently preferred to make a single tubular base form from Powernet™, the base garment reducing in diameter in the axial direction from an upper opening diameter to a waist diameter, then increasing in diameter to a hip diameter, then reducing again to a lower opening diameter. An upper portion of the base garment constitutes bodice part 1 1 of the finished garment whilst a lower portion constitutes skirt part 21 or a portion of the brief 25 or leggings 24. This base garment component can be made from suitably patterned longitudinal strip panels edge seamed together but provided with an opening seam 6, 7 at the back extending a vertical distance or the whole vertical length of the base garment and provided with fastenings 8 as described previously. The waist elastic can then be elastic stitched over the base garment or stretch seamed to it at one or more waist lines, or as preferred in the form of a heavy satin elastic over waist seam 2. The upper and lower arcuate panels 3, 13 which are a feature of the invention can be cut separately from Powernet™ with the predominant elasticity in the axial direction and then be seamed into place, on the exterior (or interior) of this base garment. [0084] An important feature of the embodiments of figures 4 to 7 relates to the outline of the rear upper portion 26 of each garment which minimises the amount of material covering the back of the wearer, making them ideal for use with backless or plunging back over garments. This is achieved by quickly tapering the upper panel 3 and adjacent portions of the connected bodice 1 1 toward termination points 27 at the waist portion 2. These can be located at, or circumferentially offset from, the centre 28 of the waist portion 2. This arrangement utilises the effective combination of an anchoring waist portion, with an upper panel that promotes a generally conical form, providing extra support at the front and centre region 29 below the bust where needed to hold the stomach and provide support for the bust region above, whilst enabling minimalisation of the vertical extent of the garment above the waist at the back for use with plunging back over garments. [0085] Straps 30 may also be included if required and can be in any suitable form, preferably adjustable in a number of configurations and removable if not required. [0086] If preferred the base garment component could be programmatically knitted as a single garment from suitable fibres, in the manner of a body stocking. The tube could then be slit or partially slit to provide for an opening seam. Similarly if preferred the upper and lower circumferentially extending panels, can be knitted as a single tubular piece of diameter varying from a top opening to a waist and then increasing to a lower opening ("bi-conical"). This part could also be slit before being combined with the base garment and before or after the addition of the elastic waist band and closures, but need not be if the garment could be pulled over the hip of a wearer. If desired the garment of the invention can include stays or boning in the bodice portion. [0087] Turning next to figures 8 to 12 there are shown several further embodiments of the invention designed so that the key functional elements of the garment can be manufactured entirely, or at least predominantly, using programmable commercial knitting machines. Again where possible like reference numerals are used to denote corresponding features. [0088] Referring firstly to Figures 8(a)-(c), there is shown a predominantly knitted full body suit similar to the cut and sew embodiment in Figures 7(a) and (b) that again incorporates a waist portion 2, upper elasticised panel 3, lower elasticised panel 13, leggings 24 and bodice portion 1 1. However, the key differences reside in the fact that the key features of at least the central portion of the garment are made using commercial knitting machines, where the different regions are given different properties by dynamically altering the knit pattern and process at different locations on the garment as required. This can be done in numerous different ways as would be known to those skilled in the art and may include, but is not limited to, varying a combination of the external dimensions of portions of the garment or fabric as well as the stitch structures , yarn composition and tension applied to the multiple thread feeds during knitting. For example stitch structures such as tucks, floats and false ribs, different yarn materials, and simple variation of stitch lengths, can all be used to modify the shape, elasticity, degree of support etc at different regions. [0089] However it is achieved, the aim is to produce a garment as described that applies maximum compression at the waist, with slightly less in the panel regions 3 and 13, to provide a structure that will sit firmly at the waist and provide generally conical compression shaping and support above and below the waist. [0090] The leggings portion 24 is also ideally formed integrally with the garment and extends from a lower edge 30 of the lower panel 13. The majority of the leggings portion of the garment shown by the unshaded region 31 in the illustrations will likely have a material structure sufficient to apply a smoothing effect to the body, but for the sake of comfort will apply less compression than the lower panel 13. This is with the exception of optional buttock lifting and supporting regions 32 which may also apply more compression and resist expansion than the surrounding material 31 . Similarly, further optional buttock regions 33 may also be provided that may apply less compression than the surrounding material regions 32 and 31 so as to accommodate bulk comfortably and allow a more rounded fullness in this region. [0091] The bodice portion 1 1 can similarly be integrally formed to extend from the upper edge 35 of the upper panel 3 and will likely include a region 36 of lower compression material that may be similar to region 31 on the leggings. This may terminate in a bra region shown generally at 37 including main cup region 38 with optional central cup region 39 and under bust support region 40. Additional components may also be added including bra cup underwires (not shown) secured as a secondary operation within channels 41 as shown, and straps 42. The relative expansion resistance of bra cup regions can be varied with the outer region 38 preferably being configured to provide shaping support and the inner region 30 having less expansion resistance to accommodate bulk and provide comfort and shape. [0092] An important optional additional feature is a sinusoidal beading of silicon, applied originally in liquid form to the inside of the garment after manufacture, the general location of which is shown at 42 although this may or may not be visible externally. Silicone has the advantage of being easy to apply and adhere, has excellent elastic properties and so can contribute to increasing the compressive force to be applied at waist region 2, and also provides a non-slip surface which helps the garment to anchor to the wearer's waist in use. It will be appreciated that other types of material could be used and applied in other manners and/or applied in other configurations such as parallel bands etc. Additional beads of non slip material could also usefully be provided at the lower back edge seam and/or other peripheral edges of the garment as required. [0093] Turning next to Figures 9 to 12 it can be seen how the key elements of the embodiment of Figure 8 can be incorporated into other forms of garment. For example Figures 9(a) and (b) show a dress version of the garment which is very similar to the body suit version shown in Figure 8, except that the lower panel 13 extends to an integrally formed skirt portion 44 formed from a lower compression material similar to region 31 on the leggings and excluding the buttock formations 32 and 33 of the leggings version. [0094] Figures 10(a) and (b) show yet another version which again has the same waist and bodice formation of the embodiments of Figures 8 and 9, but which terminates this time in a brief portion shown generally at 45. The details of the brief can varied as required and may be configured as a g-string or high cut at the sides. [0095] Figures 1 1 (a) and (b) show yet another variation in the form of a low back bralette which includes all the features of the embodiments of Figures 8-10 except that it terminates at the base of the waist portion 2. [0096] Finally, Figures 12(a) and (b) illustrate yet another variation in the form of high waisted leggings. This is again very similar to the embodiment illustrated in Figures 8(a)-(c) from the waist region down, but instead of the low back bodice with bra, the garment includes a simple tube extension portion 46 that terminates in an edge band 47 designed to sit just below the bust. [0097] Depending on the type of machine used it may be possible to manufacture the majority of the garment to be seamless, but in most forms some degree of post knitting operations will be required. [0098] Although all the embodiments have been described as separate undergarments, they can be integrated with an over garment for example a dress, as a lining or as an inner garment attached for example at the upper opening of the inner garment to an outer garment. [0099] For clothing items incorporating an undergarment of the invention made by the 'cut and sew" technique using materials with limited circumferential stretch in the waist region, attachment of the shaping garment to the opening seam of the outer garment can be beneficial so that a common closure can be used to close both the inner and outer garment greatly facilitates donning and removal. [0100] For outer clothing garments incorporating fully knitted versions of the invention that can be slipped into without the need for fasteners, these can be secured to the outer garment at convenient locations such as around the bust line thereby restricting movement between the undergarment and outer garment to minimise the risks of the undergarment being visible during use. [0101] Those skilled in the art will recognize that it has not previously been practiced to employ arcuate panels above and optionally also below an anchoring elastic waist line portion, where the panels are configured to promote, in use, a generally conical shape which tapers in a direction towards the waist. The invention thereby provides an hourglass shaping effect, not provided by corsets which are made from vertical panels, whilst girdles do not extend on either side of an elasticized waist. It is also believed to be novel to have fabric stretching predominantly in an axial direction above and below the waistline in a body shaping garment as in the described 'cut and sew" embodiments, since corsets depend upon lacing rather than stretch, and since girdles necessarily stretch predominantly in the circumferential direction. [0102] The added novel element of the garment is that the low back/backless cutout maximizes the wearer's visible skin whilst anchoring the garment's support in the elastic waist of the garment, allowing the garment to be cut much lower if desired than prior art, without sacrificing breast support. [0103] Garments according to the invention have surprised wearers both with their body shaping efficacy, aesthetic outcome, and with comfort of wear. Wearers have reported that they may appear to be at least one size smaller when wearing a garment according to the invention as an undergarment than when not wearing it. Wearers also report that the undergarment is exceptionally comfortable to wear in comparison with corsets or girdles aiming at similar effect, and do not restrict movement. Wearers also report the low back versions of the fully knitted embodiments as providing better shaping and support than other prior art knitted low back undergarments. [0104] Finally it will be appreciated that the invention can be manufactured in other forms, made from other materials, assembled in other combinations, made in other shapes and sizes, and varied in ways which will be obvious to those skilled in the art from the teaching hereof and all such variations are deemed to form part of the invention herein disclosed. 1 .
