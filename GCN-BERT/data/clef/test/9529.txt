GENUS AND SPECIES Phalaenopsis Blume VARIETY DENOMINATION ‘PHALDIPWEQ’ BACKGROUND OF THE NEW PLANT The present invention comprises a new and distinct cultivar of Phalaenopsis plant, botanically known as Phalaenopsis of the Orchidaceae family, and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name ‘PHALDIPWEQ’. Phalaenopsis comprises a genus of about 60 species of herbaceous perennials many of which, or the hybrids thereof, are suitable for cultivar in the home or greenhouse. Phalaenopsis is predominantly epiphytic or rock dwelling, and is native to tropical Asia, the Malay Archipelago, and Oceania. The species typically has 2-ranked, fleshy, oblong or elliptic leaves affixed to a short central stem (monopodial growth), which vary in size from 12 to 20 cm to over 60 cm. The leaves may be entirely green or mottled with silver grey. Phalaenopsis orchids, often referred to as ‘Moth Orchids’ in the horticultural trade, are frequently used to furnish cut flowers for the florist trade or sold as flowering potted-plants for home or interiorscape. Phalaenopsis produces upright or pendant lateral racemes or panicle, often with many showy flowers which open in succession beginning with the lowermost. The flowers possess three sepals and three petals; the lateral ones being alike. The lowermost petals, called the labellum, is three-lobed and is often more brightly-colored than the other flower segments. Flower colors include various shades of pink, white, yellow, and red-brown. Phalaenopsis orchids are typically propagated from seeds. Asexual propagation of Phalaenopsis is often done from off-shoots which arise from the lower bracts of the inflorescence. The resulting plants are detached from the mother plants and may be planted in a suitable substrate. The new Phalaenopsis ‘PHALDIPWEQ’ is particularly characterized by its attractive and unique white flowers, economical propagation by tissue culture, rapid growth, and a plant dimension suitable for packaging and shipping to the market. ‘PHALDIPWEQ’ is a product of a planned breeding program conducted in Bleiswijk, The Netherlands. The new Phalaenopsis ‘PHALDIPWEQ’ originated from a cross made in November 2004 in Bleiswijk, The Netherlands. The female parent is a white Phalaenopsis pot plant named ‘01-1638’ (unpatented), while the male parent is a white Phalaenopsis pot plant named ‘16352-0005’ (unpatented). A single plant was selected in January 2008 and has been asexually reproduced repeatedly by tissue culture in Bleiswijk, The Netherlands over a 2-year period. The new variety has been found to retain its distinctive characteristics through successive asexual propagations. Asexual reproduction of ‘PHALDIPWEQ’ by tissue culture was first performed in December 2011 in Bleiswijk, The Netherlands and has demonstrated that the new cultivar is firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. Plant Breeder's Rights for this variety have been applied for in Europe on Sep. 20, 2013. ‘PHALDIPWEQ’ has not been made publicly available or sold anywhere in the world more than one year prior to the filing date of this application. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The following are the most outstanding and distinguishing characteristics of this new cultivar when grown under normal horticultural practices in Bleiswijk, The Netherlands. 1) White flowers with white-yellow lip with purple stripes; 2) 2 peduncles; 3) Inflorescence is long and sturdy; 4) The shape of the leaf is narrow and oblong; and 5) Plants are propagated by tissue culture. DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS This new Phalaenopsis plant is illustrated by the accompanying photographs which show the overall plant habit including blooms, buds and foliage of the plant; the colors shown are as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures. The photographs are of a 50-week old plant grown in a greenhouse in Bleiswijk, The Netherlands in February 2014. FIG. 1 shows the overall plant habit, including blooms, buds and foliage of ‘PHALDIPWEQ’. FIG. 2 shows a close-up of the flower of ‘PHALDIPWEQ’. FIG. 3 shows a close-up of the leaves of ‘PHALDIPWEQ’. DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW VARIETY The following detailed description sets forth the distinctive characteristics of ‘PHALDIPWEQ’. The data which define these characteristics were collected from asexual reproductions carried out in Bleiswijk, The Netherlands. The plant history was taken on 50-week old plants which were planted from tissue culture in 12 centimeter pots and grown in a greenhouse between 27° C. to 29° C. for 30 weeks, continued by a cooling period of 8 weeks between 18° C. to 20° C. and 12 weeks in a greenhouse of 21° C. Observations were made in February 2014. Color readings were taken under 4-6000 lux natural light in the greenhouse. Color references are primarily to The R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society of London (R.H.S.) (2001). DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION Classification: Family.—Orchidaceae.Botanical.—Phalaenopsis Blume.Common name.—Phalaenopsis.
