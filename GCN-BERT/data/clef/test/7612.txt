Step 2. 2-Bromo-1-fluoro-5-iodo-3-methylbenzene
To a solution of 4-bromo-3-fluoro-5-methylaniline (7.28 g, 36 mmol) in acetonitrile (190 mL) cooled to 0° C. was added aqueous sulfuric acid (4.75 mL, 89 mmol in 10 mL H2O). After stirring for 5 minutes, a solution of sodium nitrite (4.92 g, 71.4 mmol) in water (10 mL) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 15 minutes at 0° C. Potassium iodide (23.7 g, 143 mmol) in water (20 mL) was then added, and the ice-bath was removed. After warming to room temperature the reaction was stirred for an additional 20 minutes before the reaction was treated with aqueous Na2S2O3. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (10.3 g, 94%).
