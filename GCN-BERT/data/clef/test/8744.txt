Step 4:
1-benzyl-1,7-diazaspiro[4,4]nonane
At 0°C, to a suspension of lithium aluminum hydride (7.13 g, 187.99 mmol, 5.60 equivalents) in tetrahydrofuran (300.00 mL) was added 1-benzoyl-1,7-diazaspiro[4,4] nonane-6-one (8.2 g, 33.57 mmol, 1.00 equivalent) in separate portions. After completion of the addition, the mixture was heated to 70°C and stirred for 2 hours. LC/MS showed complete conversion of the starting material and detected the target product. The reaction mixture was cooled to 15°C and quenched with water (7 mL), then an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (15%, 7 mL) and water (21 mL) were added. The mixture was filtered. The fitrate was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the residue obtained by concentrating was purified by silica gel column (dichloromethane: methanol = 30: 1 to 10: I) to give the title compound (3.67 g, 16.97 mmol, 50.54% yield) as a pale yellow oil.
