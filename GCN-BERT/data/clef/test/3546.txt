(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-[(6-tert-butyl-2-methoxy-pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-5-phenyl-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester
Trifluoroacetic acid (2 mL) was added to a solution of (2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-[(6-tert-butyl-2-methoxy-pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-5-phenyl-pyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylic acid 1-tert-butyl ester 2-ethyl ester (785 mg, 1.38 mmol, 1.0 eq) in dichloromethane (12 mL). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 72 hours. The solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was partitioned between dichloromethane and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The organic phase was concentrated to dryness and the residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane/methanol 100/0 to 98/2) to provide the title compound (520 mg, 80%). LC/MS (ESI+) m/z 468.8 (M+H)+.
