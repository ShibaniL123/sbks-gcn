3-methoxy-6-(trifluoromethyl)picolinaldehyde
3-Methoxypicolinaldehyde (0.150 g, 1.094 mmol) and sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate (0.500 g, 3.20 mmol) were dissolved in diethylcarbonate (6.6 mL) and water (4.4 mL), and the mixture was cooled to 0° C. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (70% aqueous, 0.704 g, 5.47 mmol) was then added dropwise. The reaction was stirred in the ice bath for 5 minutes and was then heated at 90° C. for 90 minutes. After this time, the reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous Na2S2O3 solution (10 mL) and then diluted with ethanol (20 mL). The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo, then the resulting material was taken up in 20% CH3OH-ethyl acetate and filtered through a pad of silica gel on a fritted glass funnel, eluting with 10% CH3OH-ethyl acetate. The combined filtrates were concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography, eluting with an eluent gradient of 40% ethyl acetate-heptanes to 100% ethyl acetate, to provide the title compound 0.0245 g, 11% yield.
