CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2013-0017302, filed on Feb. 19, 2013, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein for all purposes by this reference. BACKGROUND (a) Technical Field The present invention relates to a thermoplastic elastomer composition having excellent thermal resistance, and more specifically to such a thermoplastic elastomer composition which improves heat resistance, grease resistance and the like of the composition and which can be applied to an automotive constant velocity joint boot and the like. In particular, the thermoplastic elastomer composition increases a hard segment proportion of the thermoplastic elastomer, which comprises a soft segment and a hard segment, and further comprises an amine-based additive. (b) Background Art A constant velocity joint boot plays a role of transferring rotational power from a vehicle engine and transmission to the wheels. The joint boot typically includes a joint part made of a bearing for smoothly transferring rotational power, grease at a joint part for reducing friction of the joint part, and a rubber material covering the connecting part. However, long-term durability is not maintained with the conventional rubber material due to a temperature increase around the boot which occurs when a discharge system for high power of vehicles changes. Further, this reduced durability results in tearing of the rubber of the constant velocity joint boot, which allows the grease to flow out between the torn rubber. This flow of grease, causes a reduction of engine power, a reduction of vehicle lifespan, and an increase of noise under suspension. In attempt to solve these problems, a heat resistance-improved composition based on a chloroprene rubber has been used. Conventional chloroprene rubber has been extensively used for a constant velocity joint boot due to its excellent grease resistance. However, in order to increase heat resistance of the chloroprene rubber composition, which has a use temperature of up to 100° C., a cross-linking accelerator was added, and a sulfur cross-link was changed to a peroxide cross-link. This increased the temperature range at which the chloroprene rubber composition can be used by about 20° C. Further, in order to secure low temperature flexibility of the chloroprene rubber composition, a plasticizer was further added thereto thereby expanding the temperature range at which the chloroprene rubber composition can be used to about −45˜120° C. However, although the temperature range at which the chloroprene rubber composition can be used became wider, there was a problem of continuous difficulty of use because the lifespan of the composition is short and variation in lifespan was wide based on external conditions. Accordingly, it is needed to develop a composition, which can maintain the performance of the constant velocity joint boot even at high temperature, and has excellent performance such as grease resistance, salt water resistance and the like. The description provided above as a related art of the present invention is just for helping understanding the background of the present invention and should not be construed as being included in the related art known by those skilled in the art.

Components The present invention relates to a thermoplastic elastomer composition having excellent thermal resistance. The thermoplastic elastomer is a polymer material having both characters of plastic and rubber by its inclusion of a hard segment of a resin component, an elastic soft segment of a rubber component and the like. According to embodiments of the present invention, the thermoplastic elastomer composition has an elasticity identical (or nearly identical) with that, of the rubber at room temperature, while also being plasticized at high temperature, so as to be molded. More specifically, the thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) is formed by hydrogen bonding, ion bonding, van der Waals bonding and physical cross-linking. This is in contrast with a vulcanized rubber, which is cross-linked by strong covalent bonding. Accordingly, the TPE of the present invention it has an elasticity similar to that of a vulcanized rubber at room temperature, but it can be subjected to extrusion and injection molding unlike the vulcanized rubber. In particular, while the vulcanized rubber is carbonized when heating, the TPE of the present invention maintains an extrusion and injection molded shape and shows elasticity when cooled. According to embodiments of the present invention, the above-described characteristics are provided through the use of the hard segment and the soft segment inside the thermoplastic elastomer. The hard segment contributes to physical bonding, and, in particular, hydrogen bonding, ion bonding, van der Waals bonding, physical cross-link and the like are typically used. The soft segment contributes to providing elasticity like the rubber, such that when molecules in a disordered state become ordered by an external force, elasticity is generated by natural return to the disordered state. FIG. 1 shows a chemical formula of the hard segment connected with the soft segment according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the thermoplastic elastomer composition consists of hard segment containing terephthalate and butanol, and the soft segment containing terephthalate and methylene glycol. In the thermoplastic elastomer comprising the hard segment and the soft segment, it is preferred that the hard segment is derived from 1,4-butanediol (BDO); and dimethylene terephthalate (DMT) or polybutyleneterephthalate (PBT). It is further preferred that the soft segment is derived from polytetramethylene etherglycon (PTMEG); and dimethyleneterephthalate (DMT) or polybutyleneterephthalate (PBT). 2. Contents In order to improve heat resistance and grease resistance of the composition, in the present invention, it is preferred that the amount of the hard segment, is about 40˜60 wt %, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic elastomer. According to a preferred embodiment, the hard segment is formed of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and 1,4-butanediol (BDO). 3. Bulk Polymerization The polymerization method for manufacturing a polymer may be solution polymerization, bulk polymerization, suspension polymerization, emulsion polymerization and the like. In the past, solution polymerization was used for polymerizing thermoplastic elastomers. The present invention is characterized by using bulk polymerization. This is because, when using the bulk polymerization, molecular weight of the thermoplastic elastomer can be further increased. This increase in molecular weight allows for an increase in melt viscosity of the elastomer, which thereby improves heat resistance, grease resistance and the like of the thermoplastic elastomer. With respect to solution polymerization, this method is a polymerization method using a monomer, a solvent and an initiator, wherein heat generated during polymerization is easily removed by evaporative reflux of the solvent. However, solution polymerization is not a good method for obtaining a solid polymer because it is not easy to remove the solvent after completing the polymerization. Further, molecular weight of the polymer is lower than polymers provided through other polymerization methods, and polymerization is slow due to the use of the solvent. With respect to bulk polymerization, this method is a polymerization method using a monomer and an initiator, and has an advantage of obtaining a pure polymer without impurities. In bulk polymerization, it is easy to perform processes such as stirring, removing heat of polymerization and the like because viscosity of the polymer is not high except in the last stage of the polymerization reaction. Further, bulk polymerization is advantageous in that reaction apparatuses are simple and easy to operate, and a highly pure product having high polymerization degree can be obtained. More specifically, molecular weight of the conventional thermoplastic elastomer, which was prepared using the solution polymerization method, was 100,000 or less. On the other hand, the thermoplastic elastomer according to the present invention, which was prepared using the bulk polymerization method is characterized in that the molecular weight thereof is about 200,000 or more, which is at least twice that of the conventional thermoplastic elastomer. Further, due to the increased molecular weight of the present composition, the melt viscosity is increased by at least about twice that of conventional thermoplastic elastomers, particularly from about 1.7 g/min to about 0.5 g/min. 4. Amine-Based Additives The thermoplastic elastomer composition according to the present invention preferably further comprises an amine-based additive as a heat stabilizer and an anti-aging agent in order to increase the heat resistance and improve the durability. According to various embodiments, the heat resistance is increased by about 16% or more as compared with conventional thermoplastic elastomer compositions. The amine-based additives can be any known in the art, and it preferably is a combination of carbonyl-bis-caprolactam (CBC) and 1,3-phenylene-bis-oxazoline (1,3-PBO). Herein, FIG. 2 is a chemical formula of the carbonyl-bis-caprolactam (CBC), and FIG. 3 is a chemical formula of the 1,3-phenylene-bis-oxazoline (1,3-PBO). Further, it is preferred that the amine-based additive comprises a combination of carbonyl-bis-caprolactam and 1,3-phenylene-bis-oxazoline, wherein the combination includes about 1˜3 parts by weight carbonyl-bis-caprolactam and about 1˜3 parts by weight 1,3-phenylene-bis-oxazoline, based on 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic elastomer. According to an exemplary embodiment, the amine-based additive comprises about 3 wt % carbonyl-bis-caprolactam and about 2 wt % 1,3-phenylene-bis-oxazoline. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the composition further comprises various additives, reinforcing agents, heat resistance stabilizers as a filler, weather resistance stabilizers, antistatic agents, lubricants, slip agents, nucleating agents, frame resistants, wollastonite, calcium carbonate, mica, kaolin, clay, barium sulfate, calcium sulfate and/or the like. 5.
