ORAL CARE COMPOSITION Background of the Invention [0001] Compositions having a high water content tend to support the survival and growth of microorganisms. This problem also occurs in oral care compositions which have a high water content. Therefore, preservative agents such as benzyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben are often added to oral care compositions in order to increase their robustness towards microbial challenge. [0002] However, a need still exists for oral care compositions which have improved robustness towards microbial attack without requiring the presence of preservative agents in the compositions. [0002a] Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which has been included in the present specification is not to be taken as an admission that any or all of these matters form part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present disclosure as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application. [0002b] Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.

[0067] Embodiments of the present invention are further described in the following examples. The examples are merely illustrative and do not in any way Emit the scope of the invention as described and claimed. Examples [0068] Compositions A to G were formulated, as shown in Table 1, in order to assess the impact of different concentrations of SnCk on the robustness of a high water-content silicabased dentifrice against microbial challenge. Each of these compositions has a high total water content (from both CP water and from the 70% sorbitol solution). [0069] The Micro Robustness Index (MRI) of each of these compositions was measured. The Micro Robustness Index is used as a quantitative measure of a composition’s ability to withstand microbial challenge. The MRI is the result from a challenge test assessing the antimicrobial efficacy of a compound/composition against a pool of microorganisms including Burkholderia cepacia, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klesiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonasputida, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Samples are challenged 3 times at 30 minute intervals with an innoculum of 107 bacteria from the above listed pool. After 4, 6 and 24 hours, aliquots are tested to measure the log reduction of bacteria. Using these data, the area under the curve (AUC) is calculated and then converted into the MRI; the higher the MRI, the greater the microrobustness of the tested composition. [0070] The present inventors have found that an MRI of at least 0.75 is required in order to show that a composition has an acceptable level of robustness against microbial attack. MRI lower than 0.75 may not adequately reduce the pool of microorganisms and results in greater risk of microbial attack. [0071] The Micro Robustness Index (MRI) for each of Compositions A to F are shown in Table 1 (all figures are in percent by weight).

This composition therefore did not have an acceptable level of robustness towards microbial challenge. [0073] However, it can be seen from the results in Table 1 that the high water content compositions which contained between 0.15 wt% and 0.75 wt% SnCl2 gave MRI values of greater than 0.75. These compositions therefore show an acceptable level of robustness towards microbial challenge. While a concentration of 0.15 wt% SnCT allowed the composition to attain the MRI>0.75 acceptance criteria, a concentration of 0.3 wt% SnCT allowed the composition to attain an excellent result of MRI = 0.91. In contrast, compositions up to 0.10 wt% SnCT showed insufficient MRI, not even reaching half the 0.75 target. [0074] While additional SnCT could be added, the increase in MRI was relatively negligible compared to the cost of a 66% increase in SnCT (0.3 wt% vs. 0.5 wt%) or a 150% increase in SnCT (0.3 wt.% vs. 0.75 wt%). Moreover, SnCT, is an astringent compound that tastes even worse than SnF2 (which has a bitter, salty taste) and one of skill in the art would be motivated to minimize the amount used once a requisite level of MRI has been achieved.
