Preparation of (3-(fluoromethyl)oxetan-3-yl)methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate
Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (1.47 ml, 8.74 mmol), followed by 2,6-dimethylpyridine (1.12 ml, 9.57 mmol) were added to a solution of (3-(fluoromethyl)oxetan-3-yl)methanol (1.00 g, 8.32 mmol) in DCM (30.7 mL) and the reaction was stirred at 0Â° C. for 1 hour. The reaction was washed with water and 1N citric acid solution, then dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated to afford (3-(fluoromethyl)oxetan-3-yl)methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (1.98 g, 94%) as a red oil, which was used directly without further purification.
