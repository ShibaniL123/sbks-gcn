CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of European Patent Application No. 10183018.0, filed on Sep. 30, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to carrier particles for use in dry powder formulations for inhalation, and formulations thereof. In particular, the present invention relates to the use of magnesium stearate in powder formulation for inhalation comprising carrier particles to inhibit or reduce chemical degradation of an active ingredient bearing a group susceptible to hydrolysis. The present invention also relates to methods for producing such carrier particles, pharmaceutical formulations which contain such carrier particles, and method of treating certain conditions by administering such a pharmaceutical formulation. 2. Discussion of the Background Dry powder inhalation (DPI) drug therapy has been used for many years to treat respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and allergic rhinitis. Compared to oral drug intake, only relatively small doses are needed for effective therapy as first pass metabolism is significantly reduced. Such small doses reduce the body's exposure to the drug and minimize side effects. Systemic adverse effects are also reduced as topical lung delivery takes the drug directly to the site of action. Lower dosage regimens may also provide considerable cost savings, particularly where expensive therapeutic agents are concerned. Dry powder forms are typically formulated by mixing the drug in micronized form with physiologically acceptable pharmacologically inert coarse carrier particles, giving rise to ordered mixture where the micronized active particles adhere to the surface of the carrier particles whilst in the inhaler device. During inhalation, the drug particles separate from the surface of carrier particles and penetrate into the lower lungs, while the larger carrier particles are mostly deposited in the oropharyngeal cavity. To promote the release of the drug particles from the surface carrier particles and, hence, to increase the fraction of respirable particles, additives with lubricant or anti-adherent properties have been proposed in the art. A particularly useful additive has been found to be magnesium stearate. The benefit of using magnesium stearate in dry powders is taught for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,096, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Specifically, it teaches that magnesium stearate can be used to alter the surface properties of carrier particles and thereby improve the properties of dry powder formulations. This reference also reports an “advantageous relationship” between surface coating carrier particles with magnesium stearate and the fine particle fraction (respirable fraction) of the emitted dose. Besides the delivered respirable fraction, another important requirement is that the active ingredient should be chemically stable in the dry powder pharmaceutical formulations on storage. In fact, it is known that active substances may demonstrate instability to one or more factors, i.e. heat, light or moisture, and various precautions must be taken in formulating and storing such substances to ensure that the pharmaceutical products remain in an acceptable condition for use over a reasonable period of time, such that they have an adequate shelf-life. In particular, active ingredients bearing certain groups such as a carbonate group, a carbamate group, and an ester group, in the presence of high temperature and/or percentage of moisture could give rise to degradation products occurring through hydrolysis pathway. WO 00/28979, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes the use of magnesium stearate in dry powder formulations for inhalation to improve resistance to moisture and to reduce the effect of penetrating moisture on the fine particle fraction, i.e. the respirable fraction of an inhaled formulation. Such interference with physical interactions between a carrier and a drug substance is distinct from chemical instability resulting from degradation. WO 2005/004845, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses the use of magnesium stearate to inhibit or reduce chemical interaction between an active ingredient substance and a carrier in a solid pharmaceutical formulation, wherein the active ingredient substance is susceptible to chemical interaction with the carrier through Maillard reaction. Said reaction involves the formation of adducts between amines and reducing sugars such al lactose. Thus it is distinct from hydrolysis and concern drugs active ingredients bearing primary or secondary amino groups. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide novel carrier particles which are useful for carrying particles of an active ingredient which has a group susceptible to hydrolysis. It is another object of the present invention to provide novel methods for preparing such carrier particle. It is another object of the present invention to provide novel powder formulations for inhalation comprising carrier particles and an active ingredient bearing a group susceptible to hydrolysis selected from the group consisting of a carbonate group, a carbamate group, and an ester group. It is another object of the present invention to provide novel methods for preparing such a powder formulation. It is another object of the present invention to provide novel methods of treating and/or preventing certain conditions by administering such a formulation. It is another object of the present invention to provide novel methods for stabilizing an active ingredient which is contained in a powder formulation and which bears a group susceptible to hydrolysis selected from the group consisting of a carbonate group, a carbamate group, and an ester group to inhibit or reduce chemical degradation of the active ingredient. These and other objects, which will become apparent during the following detailed description, have been achieved by the inventors' discovery that including magnesium stearate in a powder formulation for inhalation comprising carrier particles and an active ingredient bearing a group susceptible to hydrolysis selected from the group consisting of a carbonate group, a carbamate group, and an ester group can inhibit or reduce chemical degradation of said active ingredient. Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention provides the use of magnesium stearate in powder formulation for inhalation comprising carrier particles and an active ingredient bearing a group susceptible to hydrolysis selected from the group consisting of a carbonate group, a carbamate group, and an ester group to inhibit or reduce chemical degradation of said active ingredient. Preferably, said magnesium stearate coats the surface of the carrier particles. The chemical stability of the active ingredient in the powder formulation may thereby be improved. In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method to inhibit or reduce chemical degradation of an active ingredient for inhalation bearing a group susceptible to hydrolysis selected from the group consisting of a carbonate group, a carbamate group, and an ester group, which comprises mixing the carrier particles with magnesium stearate. In a third aspect, the present invention provides a dry powder pharmaceutical formulation for inhalation comprising (a) carrier particles, (b) magnesium stearate, and (c) an active ingredient belonging to the class of the antimuscarinic drug bearing a carbonate group. In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides a dry powder inhaler filled with afore mentioned pharmaceutical formulation. In another aspect, the present invention provides methods for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of certain conditions by administering an effective amount of such a pharmaceutical formulation. The present inventors have found that, in the presence of magnesium stearate, active ingredients bearing chemical group prone to hydrolysis turn out to be more chemically stable upon storage in particular stressing conditions i.e., in the presence of high temperature and/or high percentage of moisture. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same become better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein: FIG. 1 is a sketch of the film forming process around a single carrier particles. FIG. 2 is a plot of CHF 5551.02 content versus time (ambient=60% relative humidity, R.H.). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The terms “active drug,” “active ingredient,” “active,” “active substance,” and “active compound” are used synonymously. The terms “muscarinic receptor antagonists,” “antimuscarinic drugs,” and “anticholinergic drugs” are used synonymously. The term “coating” refers to the covering of the surface of the carrier particles by forming a (mono)molecluar film of magnesium stearate around said particles as reported in the sketch of FIG. 1. The percentage of surface coating indicate the extent by which magnesium stearate coats the surface of all the carrier particles. The expression “to inhibit or reduce chemical degradation of an active ingredient” means that, upon storage, degradation product(s) arising from hydrolysis of a group susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage are not formed or are formed in a lesser amount than the formulation comprising no magnesium stearate. “Single dose” refers to the quantity of active ingredient administered at one time by inhalation upon actuation of an inhaler. “Actuation” refers to the release of active ingredient from a device by a single activation (e.g. mechanical or breath). The expression “chemically stable” refers to a formulation that meets the requirements of the ICH Guideline Q1A referring to “Stability Testing of new Active Substances (and Medicinal Products)”. In general terms, the particle size of particles is quantified by measuring a characteristic equivalent sphere diameter, known as volume diameter, by laser diffraction. The particle size can also be quantified by measuring the mass diameter by means of suitable known instruments, such as sieving. The volume diameter (VD) is related to the mass diameter (MD) by the density of the particles (assuming a size independent density for the particles). In the present application, the particle size interval is expressed in terms of mass diameter. The particle size distribution is generally expressed in terms of: i) the volume median diameter (VMD) or the mass median diameter (MMD) which corresponds to the diameter of 50 percent of the particles by volume or weight respectively, e.g. d(0.5); and ii) the mass or volume diameter of 10% and 90% of the particles, respectively, e.g. d(0.1) and d(0.9). The expression “respirable fraction” refers to an index of the percentage of active particles which would reach the deep lungs in a patient. The respirable fraction, also termed fine particle fraction, is commonly evaluated using suitable in vitro apparata such as Multistage Cascade Impactor or Multi Stage Liquid Impinger (MLSI) according to procedures reported in common Pharmacopoeias. The present invention finds application in dry powder formulations for inhalation comprising carrier particles and at least one micronized active ingredient. The carrier particles may be made of any physiologically acceptable pharmacologically-inert material or combination of materials suitable for inhalatory use. For example, the carrier particles may be composed of one or more materials selected from sugar alcohols; polyols, for example sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol, and crystalline sugars, including monosaccharides and disaccharides; inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and calcium carbonate; organic salts such as sodium lactate; and other organic compounds such as urea, polysaccharides, for example starch and its derivatives; oligosaccharides, for example cyclodextrins and dextrins. Advantageously, the carrier particles are made of a crystalline sugar, for example, a monosaccharide such as glucose or arabinose, or a disaccharide such as maltose, saccharose, dextrose or lactose. Preferably, the carrier particles are made of lactose, more preferably of alpha-lactose monohydrate. Advantageously, said coarse carrier particles have a mass diameter (MD) of at least 20 microns, more advantageously greater that 50 microns. Preferably the MD is 50 microns to 1000 microns, more preferably 80 to 500 microns. In certain embodiments of the invention, the MD is 90 to 150 microns. In other embodiments, the MD is 150 to 400 microns, and preferably 210 to 355 microns. The desired particle size may be obtained by sieving. When their MD is 150 to 400 microns, the coarse carrier particles have preferably a relatively highly fissured surface, that is, on which there are clefts and valleys and other recessed regions, referred to herein collectively as fissures. The “relatively highly fissured” coarse particles can be defined in terms of fissure index or rugosity coefficient as described in WO 01/78695 and WO 01/78693, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, and they can be characterized according to the description therein reported. Said coarse carrier particles may also be characterized in terms of tapped density or total intrusion volume measured as reported in WO 01/78695, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The tapped density of the coarse carrier particles is advantageously less than 0.8 g/cm3, preferably 0.8 to 0.5 g/cm3. The total intrusion volume is of at least 0.8 cm3 preferably at least 0.9 cm3. The formulation may also comprise fine particles of a physiologically acceptable pharmacologically-inert material with a mass median diameter (MMD) equal to or less than 10 microns. The percentage of said fine particles is advantageously 0.1 to 20% of the total amount of the formulation, preferably 5 to 15%. Preferably, the coarse particles and the fine particles are constituted of the same physiologically acceptable pharmacologically-inert material. The amount of magnesium stearate present in the formulation varies depending on both the dry powder inhaler and type the active ingredient. The skilled person, aware of the physical and chemical properties of the active ingredient and of the type of inhaler, for example single dose or multidose, will be able to select an appropriate amount. Advantageously, the amount of magnesium stearate may be 0.05 to 1.5% by weight of the carrier. More advantageously it may be 0.1 to 1.0% by weight of the carrier. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of magnesium stearate may be 0.15 to 0.5%, more preferably 0.2 to 0.4% w/w, while in other preferred embodiments it may be 0.5 to 1.5% by weight or 0.8 to 1.0% w/w. Preferably, the carrier particles are subjected to coating with magnesium stearate particles until the extent of coating is of at least 10%, advantageously higher than 12%, preferably equal to or higher than 20%. Coating could be obtained by mixing the carrier particles and the magnesium stearate particles according to the conditions disclosed in WO 00/53157, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In particular embodiments, by applying the conditions disclosed in the co-pending application EP 10158951.3, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, an extent of coating of more than 60%, advantageously higher than 70%, more advantageously of at least 80%, preferably higher than 85%, more preferably higher than 90%, even more preferably higher than 95% could be obtained. If alpha-lactose monohydrate is used as a carrier, the extent to which magnesium stearate coats the surface of the carrier particles may be determined by first measuring the water contact angle, and then applying the equation known in the literature as Cassie or Cassie and Baxter, reported anyway as follows (Colombo I et al Il Farmaco 1984, 39(10), p. 338) (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety: [in-line-formulae]cos θmixture=fMgSt cos θMgSt+flactose cos θlactose [/in-line-formulae] where fMgSt and flactose are the surface area fractions of magnesium stearate and of lactose; θMgSt is the water contact angle of magnesium stearate; θlactose is the water contact angle of lactose θmixture are the experimental contact angle values. The measure of the contact angle between a liquid and a solid surface is commonly used in the art for determining the wettability of solids. This approach is based on the capability of a liquid to spread spontaneously over the surface of a solid to reach a thermodynamic equilibrium. For the purpose of the present invention, the contact angle may be determined with methods that are essentially based on goniometric measurement. These imply the direct observation of the angle formed between the solid substrate and the liquid under testing. It is therefore quite simple to carry out, being the only limitation related to possible bias stemming from intra-operator variability. It should be, however, underlined that this drawback can be overcome by adoption a fully automated procedure, such as a computer assisted image analysis. A particularly useful approach is the sessile or static drop method which is typically carried out by depositing a liquid drop onto the surface of the powder in form of disc obtained by compaction (known as compressed powder disc method). Typically, the procedure is carried out as follows: The compressed disc is prepared by adding the sample into the die of a press and a compression force of 5 kN is applied for 3 minutes. Then the compressed disc is placed on a plate of a surface wettability tester and a water drop of about 10 μl is formed on the surface of the disc. A suitable surface wettability tester is, for example, that available from Lorentzen & Wettre GmbH. The pictures are taken with a videocamera and the water contact angles values are given by a computer assisting in the analysis of the image. If a fully automated procedure is not available, the base (b) and the height (h) of the drop are measured on the display using a mobile reading scale, then the water contact angles (WCA) are calculated by applying the following formula: [in-line-formulae]WCA=[arc tg2h/b]×2×180/π[/in-line-formulae] Typically, the values are calculated as a mean of three different measurements taken at room temperature. The precision is usually of about ±5°. Advantageously, by using the sessile drop method, and considering as reference water contact values of 12° for alpha-lactose monohydrate and of 118° for magnesium stearate, the experimental water contact angle is at least of 34°, more advantageously equal to or higher 36°, preferably equal to or higher than 39°, more preferably equal to or higher than 50°. By applying the conditions disclosed in the co-pending application EP 10158951.3, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, experimental water contact angles equal to or higher than 90°, preferably higher than 100° may be obtained. The extent to which the magnesium stearate coats the surface of the lactose particles may also be determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a versatile analytical technique well known in the art. Such microscopy may be equipped with an EDX analyzer (an Electron Dispersive X-ray analyzer), that can produce an image selective to certain types of atoms, for example magnesium atoms. In this manner it is possible to obtain a clear data set on the distribution of magnesium stearate on the surface of carrier particles. SEM may alternatively combined with IR or Raman spectroscopy for determining the extent of coating, according to well known procedures. Another analytical technique that may advantageously be used is X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), by which it has been possible to calculate both the extent of coating and the depth of the magnesium sterate film around the lactose particles. XPS measurements may be taken with commercially available instruments such as Axis-Ultra instrument from Kratos Analytical (Manchester UK), typically using monochromated Al Kα radiation according to known procedures. The active ingredient is a drug for inhalation bearing a chemical group susceptible to hydrolysis such as a carbonate group, a carbamate group, or an ester group, preferably a carbonate group or a carbamate group, more preferably a carbonate group. Drugs bearing said groups typically behave as soft drugs and, once inhaled, are degraded by hydrolysis to inactive compounds which are rid of any systemic side effects. They normally belong to classes which may exhibit undesired side effects due to systemic absorption such as muscarinic receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, and steroids for inhalation.

In particular, very significant results have been obtained with antimuscarinic drugs bearing a carbonate group of general formula (II). Accordingly, the present invention is also directed to a dry powder pharmaceutical formulation for inhalation comprising (a) carrier particles, (b) magnesium (c) a compound of general formula (II) as active ingredient. Preferably, magnesium stearate is present in an amount of 0.1 to 1.0% based on the total weight of the carrier and coats the surface of the carrier particles. The carrier particles are preferably made of alpha-lactose monohydrate and have a particle size of 212 to 355 microns. In order that the active ingredient is inhalable, i.e. it can pass into the deep lung such as the terminal and respiratory bronchioles and the alveolar ducts and sacs, it must be in particulate form having a mean particle diameter (measured as the mass mean diameter) of at most about 10 microns, preferably 1 to 6 microns, more preferably 2 to 4 microns. Such microfine particles can be obtained in a manner known per se, for example by micronization, controlled precipitation from selected solvents, or by spray drying. The compound of formula (II) is typically present in an amount of 0.01 to 5%, w/w, based on the total weight of the composition, preferably 0.05 to 4% w/w, more preferably 0.1 to 2.5% w/w, based on the total weight of the composition.

The dry powder formulations of the invention could also comprise further active ingredients such as drugs belonging to the classes of steroids for inhalation, beta2-agonists, and phosphopiesterase-4 inhibitors, and their combinations. The formulation of the invention can be prepared according to known methods, and may be utilized with any dry powder inhaler. Dry powder inhalers can be divided into two basic types: i) single dose inhalers, for the administration of single subdivided doses of the active compound; each single dose is usually filled in a capsule; and ii) multidose inhalers pre-loaded with quantities of active principles sufficient for longer treatment cycles. The dry powder formulation for inhalation according to the present invention is particularly suitable for multidose dry powder inhalers comprising a reservoir from which individual therapeutic dosages can be withdrawn on demand through actuation of the device, for example that described in WO 2004/012801, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Administration of the formulations of the present invention may be indicated for prevention and/or the treatment of mild, moderate or severe acute or chronic symptoms or for prophylactic treatment of an inflammatory or obstructive airways disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Other respiratory disorders characterized by obstruction of the peripheral airways as a result of inflammation and presence of mucus may also benefit from the formulation of the invention. Other features of the invention will become apparent in the course of the following descriptions of exemplary embodiments which are given for illustration of the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof. Examples The investigation was aimed at evaluating the chemical compatibility of active ingredients bearing a group susceptible to hydrolysis with carriers for powders for inhalation. Test Compound. The drug used as the test compound was (R)-3-[bis-(3-fluoro-phenyl)-methoxycarbonyloxy]-1-(2-oxo-2-thiophen-2-yl-ethyl)-1-azonia-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane; chloride. This drug and its synthesis are disclosed in WO 2009/015324, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. It was micronized before use leading to a particle size of d(v, 0.1)=0.7 μm, d(v, 0.5)=2.7 μm, d(v, 0.9)=9.2 μm. Excipients. Alpha-lactose monohydrate commercially available as Capsulac® 60 (Meggle) was used. The fraction of interest, 212-355 microns was obtained by sieving. Magnesium stearate of vegetable origin was used having a starting particle size with a MMD of less than 10 microns. Formulations. Dry powder formulations were prepared comprising as a carrier either particles of alpha-lactose monohydrate 212-355 microns alone (coarse) or coated with magnesium stearate (coated). Said coated particles were obtained by mixing alpha-lactose monohydrate with 1% magnesium stearate in a Turbula mixer for 4 hours. The unit formulae are reported in Table 1.
