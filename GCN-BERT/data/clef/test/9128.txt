CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/971,552, filed on Mar. 28, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel substituted aminopyrimidine compounds, and salts thereof, which are useful in the treatment of proliferative disease, autoimmune disease, allergic disease, inflammatory disease, transplantation rejection, and other diseases, in mammals. In particular, this invention relates to compounds that modulate the activity of JAK kinases, FLT3 kinase, and Aurora kinase resulting in the modulation of inter- and/or intra-cellular signaling. This invention also relates to a method of using such compounds in the treatment of proliferative disease, autoimmune disease, allergic disease, inflammatory disease, transplantation rejection, and other diseases in mammals, especially humans, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within the cell. Protein kinases, containing a similar 250-300 amino acid catalytic domain, catalyze the phosphorylation of target protein substrates. It is reported that many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include benign and malignant proliferation disorders, diseases resulting from inappropriate activation of the immune system, allograft rejection, graft vs host disease, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease and hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents. The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates in the phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Tyrosine phosphorylation is a central event in the regulation of a variety of biological processes such as cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival. Several families of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases control these events by catalyzing the transfer of phosphate from ATP to a tyrosine residue of specific cell protein targets. Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (Hanks et al., FASEB J., 1995, 9, 576-596; Knighton et al., Science, 1991, 253, 407-414; Garcia-Bustos et al., EMBO J, 1994, 13:2352-2361). Some non-limiting examples of the protein kinase include abl, Aurora, Akt, bcr-abl, BIk, Brk, Btk, c-kit, c-Met, c-src, c-fins, CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, CDK0, cRafl, CSF1 R, CSK, EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, Erb1B4, Erk, Fak, fes, Flt-3, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, Fgr, Flt-1, Fps, Frk, Fyn, Hck, IGF-1 R, INS-R, JAK, KDR, Lck, Lyn, MEK, p38, PDGFR, P1K, PKC, PYK2, ros, Tie, Tie-2, TRK, Yes, and Zap70o Aurora kinase family is a collection of highly related serine/threonine kinase that are key regulators of mitosis, essential for accurate and equal segtion of genomic material from parent to daught cells. Members of the Aurora kinase family include three related kinases known as Aurora-A, Aurora-B, and Aurora-C (also known as Aurora-1, Aurora-2, and Aurora-3). Despite significant sequence homology, the localization and functions of these kinases are largely distinct from one another (Richard D. Carvajal, et al. Clin Cancer Res., 2006, 12(23): 6869-6875; Daruka Mahadevan, et al., Expert Opin. Drug Discov., 2007 2(7): 1011-1026). Aurora-A is ubiquitously expressed and regulates cell cycle events occurring from late S phase through M phase, including centrosome maturation (Berdnik D, et al., Curr Biol., 2002, 12: 640-647), mitotic entry (Hirota T, et al., Cell, 2003, 114:585-598; Dutertre S, et al., J Cell Sci., 2004, 117:2523-2531), centrosome separation (Marumoto T. et al. J Biol. Chem., 2003, 278:51786-51795), bipolar-spindle assembly (Kufer T A, et al. J Cell Biol., 2002; 158:617-623; Eyers Pa., et al., Curr Biol., 2003; 13:691-697), chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate (Marumoto T, et al. J Biol Chem., 2003, 278:51786-51795; Kunitoku N, et al., Dev Cell., 2003, 5: 853-864), cytokinesis (Marumoto T, et al., J Biol. Chem., 2003, 278:51786-51795), and mitotic exit. Aurora-A protein levels and kinase activity both increase from late G2 through M phase, with peak activity in prometaphase. Once activated, Aurora-A mediates its multiple functions by interacting with various substrates including centrosomin, transforming acidic coiled-coil protein, cdc25b, Eg5, and centromere protein A. Aurora-B is a chromosomal passenger protein critical for accurate chromosomal segregation, cytokinesis (Hauf S., et al. J Cell Biol., 2003, 161:281-94; Ditchfield C, et al., J Cell Biol., 2003, 161:267-80; Giet R, et al., J Cell Biol., 2001, 152:669-682; Goto H, et al., J Biol. Chem., 2003, 278:8526-8530), protein localization to the centromere and kinetochore, correct microtubule-kinetochore attachments (Murata-Hori M, et al., Curr. Biol., 2002, 12:894-899), and regulation of the mitotic checkpoint. Aurora-B localizes first to the chromosomes during prophase and then to the inner centromere region between sister chromatids during prometaphase and metaphase (Zeitlin S G, et al. J Cell. Biol., 2001, 155:1147-1157). Aurora-B participates in the establishment of chromosomal biorientation, a condition where sister kinetochores are linked to opposite poles of the bipolar spindle via amphitelic attachments. Errors in this process, manifesting as a merotelic attachment state (one kinetochore attached to microtubules from both poles) or a syntelic attachment state (both sister kinetochores attached to microtubules from the same pole), lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy if not corrected before the onset of anaphase. The primary role of Aurora-B at this point of mitosis is to repair incorrect microtubule-kinetochore attachments (Hauf S, et al., J Cell Biol., 2003, 161:281-294; Ditchfield C, et al., J Cell Biol., 2003, 161:267-280; Lan W, et al. Curr Biol., 2004, 14:273-286). Without Aurora-B activity, the mitotic checkpoint is compromised, resulting in increased numbers of aneuploid cells, genetic instability, and tumorigenesis (Weaver B A, et al., Cancer Cell., 2005, 8:7-12). Aurora-A overexpression is a necessary feature of Aurora-A-induced tumorigenesis. In cells with Aurora-A overexpression, mitosis is characterized by the presence of multiple centrosomes and multipolar spindles (Meraldi P et al., EMBO J., 2002, 21:483-492). Despite the resulting aberrant microtubule-kinetochore attachments, cells abrogate the mitotic checkpoint and progress from metaphase to anaphase, resulting in numerous chromosomal separation defects. These cells fail to undergo cytokinesis, and, with additional cell cycles, polyploidy and progressive chromosomal instability develop (Anand S, et al., Cancer Cell, 2003, 3:51-62). The evidence linking Aurora overexpression and malignancy proliferation disorders, such as colon, breast, lung, pancrease, prostate, bladder, head, neck, cervix, and ovarian cancers, liver, gastric and pancreatic tumors, has stimulated interest in developing Aurora inhibitors for cancer therapy. In normal cells, Aurora-A inhibition results in delayed, but not blocked, mitotic entry, centrosome separation defects resulting in unipolar mitotic spindles, and failure of cytokinesis (Marumoto T, et al., Biol Chem, 2003, 278:51786-51795). Encouraging antitumor effects with Aurora-A inhibition were shown in three human pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2, and SU.86.86), with growth suppression in cell culture and near-total abrogation of tumorigenicity in mouse xenografts (Hata T, et al., Cancer Res., 2005, 65:2899-2905). Aurora-B inhibition results in abnormal kinetochore-microtubule attachments, failure to achieve chromosomal biorientation, and failure of cytokinesis (Goto H, et al. J Biol Chem. 2003, 278:8526-30; Severson AF1 et al. Curr Biol., 2000, 10:1162-1171). Recurrent cycles of aberrant mitosis without cytokinesis result in massive polyploidy and, ultimately, to apoptosis (Hauf S, et al., J Cell Biol., 2003, 161:281-294; Ditchfield C, et al., J Cell Biol., 2003, 161:267-80; Giet R, et al., J Cell Biol., 2001, 152:669-682; Murata-Hori M, Curr. Biol., 2002, 12:894-899; Kallio M J, et al., Curr Biol., 2002, 12:900-905). Inhibition of Aurora-A or Aurora-B activity in tumor cells results in impaired chromosome alignment, abrogation of the mitotic checkpoint, polyploidy, and subsequent cell death. These in vitro effects are greater in transformed cells than in either non-transformed or non-dividing cells (Ditchfield C, et al. J Cell Biol., 2003, 161:267-280). Thus, targeting Aurora may achieve in vivo selectivity for cancer. Although toxicity to rapidly dividing cell of the hematopoietic and gastrointestinal system is expected, the activity and clinical tolerability shown in xenograft models indicates the presence of a reasonable therapeutic index. Given the preclinical antitumor activity and potential for tumor selectivity, several Aurora kinase inhibitors have been developed. FLT3 (Flt3, FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3), also known as FLK-2 (fetal liver kinase 2) and STK-1 (human stem cell kinase 1), belongs to a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK-III) family that include KIT, PDGFR, FMS and FLT (Stirewalt D L, et al., Nat. Rev. Cancer, 2003, 3:650-665; Rosnet O, et al., Genomics 1991, 9:380-385; Yarden Y, et al., Nature, 1986, 323: 226-232; Stanley E R, et. al., J. Cell. Biochem, 1983, 21:151-159; Yarden Y, et al., EMBO J., 1987, 6:3341-3351). FLT3 is a membrane-spanning protein and composed of four domains; an extracellular ligand-binding domains consisting of five immunoglobin-like structures, a transmembrane (TM) domain, a juxtamembrane (JM) domain and a cytoplasmic C-Terminal tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. (Agnes F, et al., Gene, 1994, 145:283-288, Scheijen B, et al., Oncogene, 2002, 21:3314-3333). The ligand for FLT3 (FLT3 or FL) was cloned in 1993 and shown to be a Type I transmembrane protein expressed in cells of the hematopoietic bone marrow microenvironment, including bone marrow fibroblasts and other cells (Lyman S D, et al. Cell 1993, 75:1157-1167). Both the membrane-bound and soluable forms can activate the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor and stimulate growth of progenitor cells in the marrow and blood. Binding of ligand to receptor induces dimerisation of the receptor and activation of the kinase domains; which then autophosphorylate and catalyse phosphorylation of substrate proteins of various signal transduction pathways such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), src homologous and collagen gene (SHC), SH2-containing inositol-5-phosphatase (SHIP), and cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase with 2 Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains (SHP2), which play important roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Dosil M, et al. Mol Cell Biol., 1993, 13:6572-6585. Zhang S, Biochem Biophys Res Commun., 1999, 254:440-445). In addition to hemotopoietic cells, FLT3 gene is also expressed in placenta, gonads and brain (Maroc N, et al. Oncogene, 1993, 8: 909-918) and also plays an important role in the immune response (deLapeyriere O, et al., Leukemia, 1995, 9:1212-1218). FLT3 has also been implicated in hematopoietic disorders which are pre-malignant disorders including myeloproliferative disorders, such as thrombocythemia, essential thrombocytosis (ET), myelofibrosis (MF), chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), and polycythemia vera (PV), pre-malignant mnyelodysplastic syndromes. Hematological malignancies include leukemias, lymphomas (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), Hodgkin's disease (also called Hodgkin's lymphoma), and myelona, for instance, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL). FLT3 is overexpressed at the levels in 70-100% of cases of acute myeloid leukemias (AML), and in a high percentage of T-acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases (Griffin J D, et al., Haematol J. 2004, 5: 188-190). It is also overexpressed in a smaller subset of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis. Studies have shown that the leukemic cells of B lineage ALL and AML frequently co-express FL, setting up autocrine or paracrine signaling loops that result in the constitutive activation of FLT3 (Zheng R, et. al., Blood., 2004, 103: 267-274). A high level of the FLT3 ligand is found in the serum of patients with Langerhars cell histocytosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, which further implicates FLT3 signaling in the dysregulation of dendritic cell progenitors in those autoimmune diseases (Rolland et al., J Immuunol., 2005, 174:3067-3071). Evidence is rapidly accumulating that many types of leukemias and myeloproliferative syndromes have mutation in tyrosine kinases. FLT3 mutations are one of the most frequent somatic alterations in AML, occurring in approximately ⅓ of patients. There are two types of activating mutations in FLT3 described in patients with leukemia. These include a spectrum of internal tandem duplications (ITD) occurring within the auto-inhibitory juxtamembrane domain (Nakao M, et al., Leukemia, 1996, 10:1911-1918; Thiede C, et al., Blood, 2002, 99:4326-4335), and activation loop mutations that include Asp835Tyr (D835Y), Asp835Val (D835V), Asp835His (D835H), Asp835Glu (D835E), Asp835Ala (D835A), Asp835Asn (D835N), Asp835 deletion and Ile836 deletion (Yamamoto Y1 et al., Blood 2001: 97:2434-2439; Abu-Duhier F M, et al., Br. J. Haematol., 2001, 113:983-988). Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations within the JM domain contribute to about 17-34% of FLT3 activating mutations in AML. FLT3-ITD has also been detected at low frequency in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Yokota S, et al., Leukemia, 1997, 11:1605-1609; Horiike S, et al., Leukemia, 1997, 11:1442-1446). The ITDs are always in-frame, and are limited to the JM domain. However, they vary in length and position from patient to patient. These repeat sequences may serve to disrupt the autoinhibitory activity of the JM domain resulting in the constitutive activation of FLT3. Both FLT3-ITD and FLT3-Asp835 mutations are associated with FLT3 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of downstream targets (Mizuki M, et al. Blood, 2000, 96:3907-3914; Mizuki M, et al. Blood, 2003, 101:3164-3173; Hayakawa F, et al., Oncogene, 2000, 19: 624-631). Inhibitors of FLT3 are presently being studied and have reached clinical trials as monotherapy in relapsed or refractory AML patients, some or all of whom had FLT3 mutations. Collectively, these data suggest that FLT3 is an attractive therapeutic target for the development of kinase inhibitors for AML and other associated diseases. Janus kinase (JAK) is a family of intracellular, non-receptor tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine-mediated signals via the JAK-STAT pathway. The JAK family plays a role in the cytokine-dependent regulation of proliferation and function of cells involved in immune response. Cytokines bind to their receptors, causing receptor dimerization, and this enables JAKs to phosphorylate each other as well as specific tyrosine motifs within the cytokine receptors. STATs that recognize these phosphotyrosine motifs are recruited to the receptor, and are then themselves activated by a JAK-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation event. Upon activation, STATs dissociate from the receptors, dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus to bind to specific DNA sites and alter transcription. Currently, there are four known mammalian JAK family members: JAK1 (Janus kinase-1), JAK2 (Janus kinase-2), JAK3 (Janus kinase, leukocyte; JAKL; L-JAK and Janus kinase-3) and TYK2 (protein-tyrosine kinase 2). While JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed, JAK3 is reported to be preferentially expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and not resting T cells (“Biology and significance of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways.” Growth Factors, April 2012; 30(2): 88). JAK1 is essential for signaling for certain type I and type II cytokines. It interacts with the common gamma chain (γc) of type I cytokine receptors to elicit signals from the IL-2 receptor family, the IL-4 receptor family, the gp130 receptor family. It is also important for transducing a signal by type I (IFN-α/β) and type II (IFN-γ) interferons, and members of the IL-10 family via type II cytokine receptors. Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that JAK1 is functionally and physically associated with the type I interferon (e g., IFNalpha), type II interferon (e.g., IFNgamma), IL-2 and IL-6 cytokine receptor complexes. Furthermore, characterization of tissues derived from JAK1 knockout mice demonstrated critical roles for this kinase in the IFN, IL-IO, IL-2/IL-4, and IL-6 pathways. Expression of JAK1 in cancer cells enables individual cells to contract, potentially allowing them to escape their tumor and metastasize to other parts of the body. Elevated levels of cytokines which signal through JAK1 have been implicated in a number of immune and inflammatory diseases. JAK1 or JAK family kinase inhibitors may be useful for modulating or treating in such diseases. (Kisseleva et al., 2002, Gene 285:1-24; Levy et al., 2005, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 3:651-662). A humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 pathway (Tocilizumab) was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (Scheinecker et al., 2009, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 8:273-274). JAK2 is implicated in signaling by members of the type II cytokine receptor family (e.g. interferon receptors), the GM-CSF receptor family, the gp130 receptor family. JAK2 signaling is activated downstream from the prolactin receptor. Studies have identified a high prevalence of an acquired activating JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F) in myleoproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis, etc. The mutant JAK2 protein is able to activate downstream signaling in the absence of cytokine stimulation, resulting in autonomous growth and/or hypersensitivity to cytokines and is believed to play a role in driving these diseases. Additional mutations or translocations resulting dysregulated JAK2 function have been described in other malignancies (Ihle J. N. and Gilliland D. G., Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev., 2007, 17:8; Sayyah J. and Sayeski P. P., Curr. Oncol. Rep., 2009, 11: 117). Inhibitors of JAK2 have been described to be useful in myeloproliferative diseases (Santos et al, Blood, 2010, 115:1131; Barosi G. and Rosti V., Curr. Opin. Hematol, 2009, 16:129, Atallah E. and Versotvsek S., Exp. Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2009, 9:663). JAK3 associates exclusively with the gamma common cytokine receptor chain, which is present in the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK3 is predominantly expressed in immune cells and transduces a signal in response to its activation via tyrosine phosphorylation by interleukin receptors. Since JAK3 expression is restricted mostly to hematopoietic cells, its role in cytokine signaling is thought to be more restricted than other JAKs. Mutations of JAK3 result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). (O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Based on its role in regulating lymphocytes, JAK3 and JAK3-mediated pathways have been targeted for immunosuppressive indications (e.g., transplantation rejection and rheumatoid arthritis) (Baslund et al., 2005, Arthritis & Rheumatism 52:2686-2692; Changelian et al., 2003, Science 302: 875-878). TYK2 is implicated in IFN-α, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 signaling. Biochemical studies and gene-targeted mice uncovered the crucial role of TYK2 in immunity. Tyk2-deficient mice are viable and fertile but display multiple immunological defects, most prominently high sensitivity to infections and defective tumor surveillance. In contrast, inhibition of TYK2 results in increased resistance against allergic, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Particularly, targeting Tyk2 appears to be a promising strategy for the treatment of IL-12-, IL-23- or Type 1 IFN-mediated diseases. These include but are not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis, sarcoidosis, and tumors (Shaw, M. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2003, 100, 11594-11599; Ortmann, R. A., and Shevach, E. M. Clin. Immunol, 2001, 98, 109-118; Watford et al, Immunol. Rev., 2004, 202: 139). [“Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitors in Rheumatoid Arthritis.” Current Rheumatology Reviews, 2011, 7, 306-312]. A fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the shared p40 subunit of the IL-12 and 11-23 cytokines (Ustekinumab) was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (Krueger et al., 2007, N. Engl. J. Med. 356:580-92; Reich et al., 2009, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 8:355-356). In addition, an antibody targeting the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways underwent clinical trials for treating Crohn's Disease (Mannon et al., 2004, N. Engl. J. Med. 351: 2069-79). When dysregulated, JAK-mediated responses can positively or negatively affect cells leading to over-activation and malignancy or immune and hematopoietic deficiencies, respectively, and suggests the utility for use of inhibitors of JAK kinases. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is involved in a variety of hyperproliferative and cancer-related processes including cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and evasion of the immune system (Haura et al., Nature Clinical Practice Oncology, 2005, 2(6), 315-324; Verna et al., Cancer and Metastasis Reviews, 2003, 22, 423-434). In addition, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is important in the genesis and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and regulating both pro- and anti-inflammatory and immune responses (O'Sullivan et al., Molecular Immunology 2007, 44:2497). Therefore, the JAK/STAT pathway, and in particular all four members of the JAK family, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the asthmatic response, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, and other related inflammatory diseases of the lower respiratory tract. The JAK/STAT pathway has also been implicated to play a role in inflammatory diseases/conditions of the eye including, but not limited to, iritis, uveitis, scleritis, conjunctivitis, as well as chronic allergic responses. Since cytokines utilize different patterns of JAK kinases (O'Sullivan et al., Mol. Immunol, 2007, 44:2497; Murray J., Immunol, 2007, 178:2623), there may be utility for antagonists of JAK kinases with differing intra-family selectivity profiles in diseases associated with particular cytokines or in diseases associated with mutations or polymorphisms in the JAK/STAT pathways. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic joint inflammation. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with JAK inhibitor showed that inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3 blocks signalling by multiple cytokines that are important for lymphocyte function, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. [Fleischmann, R. et al. “Placebo-controlled trial of tofacitinib monotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis.” N. Engl. J. Med. 367, 495-507 (2012)]. It was conjectured that small-molecule inhibitors that directly inactivate specific JAK isoforms would also reduce not only the clinical symptoms of RA, but also suppress the upregulation of many of the proinflammatory cytokines that are critical in driving RA disease progression. [“Inhibitors of JAK for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: rationale and clinical data.” Clin. Invest. (2012) 2(1), 39-47] Persistent activation of STAT3 or STATS has been demonstrated in a wide spectrum of solid human tumors including breast, pancreatic, prostate, ovarian and hepatic carcinomas, as well as in the majority of hematopoietic tumors including lymphomas and leukemias. In this context, inactivation of JAK/STAT signaling in many hematopoietic tumors resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and/or induction of apoptosis. Although STAT3 in tumor cells can be activated by various kinases, JAK2 has been shown to be the most important upstream activator mediating STAT3 activation in human tumor cell lines derived from various solid tumors [Mohamad Bassam Sonbol, Belal Firwana, Ahmad Zarzour, Mohammad Morad, Vishal Rana and Ramon V. Tiu “Comprehensive review of JAK inhibitors in myeloproliferative neoplasms.” Therapeutic Advances in Hematology 2013, 4(1), 15-35; Hedvat M, Huszar D, Herrmann A, Gozgit J M, Schroeder A, Sheehy A, et al. “The JAK2 inhibitor AZD1480 potently blocks Stat3 signaling and oncogenesis in solid tumors.” Cancer Cell 2009; 16(6):487-97.]. Therefore, inhibition of JAK kinases may have a beneficial role in the therapeutic treatment of these diseases. Clearly, protein kinase inhibitors have gathered attention as a new drug category for both immunosuppression and antiinflammatory drug, and for cancer drug. Thus, new or improved agents which inhibit protein kinases such as Aurora inhibitors, FLT3 inhibitors and Janus kinases inhibitors are continually needed that act as immunosuppressive agents for organ transplants, and antitumor agents, as well as agents for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, type I diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis, autoimmune thyroid disorders, Alzheimer's disease), diseases involving a hyperactive inflammatory response (e.g., eczema), allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, cancer (e.g., prostate, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, leukemia, multiple myeloma), and some immune reactions (e.g., skin rash or contact dermatitis or diarrhea) caused by other therapeutics, to name a few. The compounds, compositions and methods described herein are directed toward these needs and other ends. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides compounds that inhibit, regulate, and/or modulate one or more protein kinases such as JAK, FLT3 and Aurora kinase activities, and are useful for treating proliferative diseases, autoimmune diseases, allergic diseases, inflammatory diseases, transplantation rejections, and their co-morbidities.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions and General Terminology Reference will now be made in detail to certain embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying structures and formulas. The invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents which may be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein, which could be used in the practice of the present invention. The present invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials described herein. In the event that one or more of the incorporated literature, patents, and similar materials differs from or contradicts this application, including but not limited to defined terms, term usage, described techniques, or the like, this application controls. It is further appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, can also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, can also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one skilled in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents and publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated. For purposes of this invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, and the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75th Ed. 1994. Additionally, general principles of organic chemistry are described in Sorrell et al., “Organic Chemistry”, University Science Books, Sausalito: 1999, and Smith et al., “March's Advanced Organic Chemistry”, John Wiley & Sons, New York: 2007, all of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. The grammatical articles “a”, “an” and “the”, as used herein, are intended to include “at least one” or “one or more” unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by the context. Thus, the articles are used herein to refer to one or more than one (i.e. at least one) of the grammatical objects of the article. By way of example, “a component” means one or more components, and thus, possibly, more than one component is contemplated and may be employed or used in an implementation of the described embodiments. As used herein, the term “subject” refers to an animal. Typically the animal is a mammal. A subject also refers to for example, primates (e.g., humans, male or female), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice, fish, birds and the like. In certain embodiments, the subject is a primate. In yet other embodiments, the subject is a human. As used herein, “patient” refers to a human (including adults and children) or other animal. In one embodiment, “patient” refers to a human. The term “comprising” is meant to be open ended, including the indicated component but not excluding other elements. “Stereoisomers” refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. Stereoisomers include enantiomer, diastereomers, conformer (rotamer), geometric (cis/trans) isomer, atropisomer, etc. “Chiral” refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term “achiral” refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner. “Enantiomers” refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. “Diastereomer” refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties or biological activities. Mixture of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography such as HPLC. Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow Parker et al., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York and Eliel et al., “Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds”, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (−) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (−) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. A specific stereoisomer may be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such stereoisomers is called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. Any asymmetric atom (e.g., carbon or the like) of the compound(s) disclosed herein can be present in racemic or enantiomerically enriched, for example the (R)-, (S)- or (R,S)-configuration. In certain embodiments, each asymmetric atom has at least 50% enantiomeric excess, at least 60% enantiomeric excess, at least 70% enantiomeric excess, at least 80% enantiomeric excess, at least 90% enantiomeric excess, at least 95% enantiomeric excess, or at least 99% enantiomeric excess in the (R)- or (S)-configuration. Depending on the choice of the starting materials and procedures, the compounds can be present in the form of one of the possible stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof, such as racemates and diastereoisomer mixtures, depending on the number of asymmetric carbon atoms. Optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. If the compound contains a double bond, the substituent may be E or Z configuration. If the compound contains a disubstituted cycloalkyl, the cycloalkyl substituent may have a cis- or trans-configuration. Any resulting mixtures of stereoisomers can be separated on the basis of the physicochemical differences of the constituents, into the pure or substantially pure geometric isomers, enantiomers, diastereomers, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by methods known to those skilled in the art, e.g., by separation of the diastereomeric salts thereof. Racemic products can also be resolved by chiral chromatography, e.g., high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral adsorbent. Preferred enantiomers can also be prepared by asymmetric syntheses. See, for example, Jacques, et al., Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions (Wiley Interscience, New York, 1981); Principles of Asymmetric Synthesis (2nd Ed. Robert et al., Elsevier, Oxford, UK, 2012); Eliel et al., Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds (McGraw-Hill, NY, 1962); and Wilen et al., Tables of Resolving Agents and Optical Resolutions p. 268 (E. L. Eliel, Ed., Univ. of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, Ind., 1972). Chiral Separation Techniques: A Practical Approach (Subramanian, G. Ed., Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim, Germany, 2007). The term “tautomer” or “tautomeric form” refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. Where tautomerization is possible (e.g. in solution), a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. A specific example of keto-enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane-2,4-dione and 4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol-keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol-keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin-4-ol and pyridin-4(1H)-one tautomers. Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms of the compounds disclosed herein are within the scope of the invention. As described herein, compounds disclosed herein may optionally be substituted with one or more substituents, such as those illustrated below, or as exemplified by particular classes, subclasses, and species of the invention. It will be appreciated that the phrase “optionally substituted” is used interchangeably with the phrase “substituted or unsubstituted”. In general, the term “substituted” refers to the replacement of one or more hydrogen radicals in a given structure with the radical of a specified substituent. The term “optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may but need not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. Unless otherwise indicated, an optionally substituted group may have a substituent at each substitutable position of the group. When more than one position in a given structure can be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at each position. Some non-limiting examples of the substituents include D, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, N3, —CN, —NO2, —OH, —SH, —NH2, —C(═O)CH2CN, —(CR6R7)n—ORc, —(CR6R7)n—NRaRb, —C(═O)R5, —S(═O)2R5, —OC(═O)R5, —O(CR6R7)n—R5, —O(CR6R7)n—OR, —N(Rc)C(═O)R5, —(CR6R7)nC(═O)ORc, —(CR6R7)nC(═O)NRaRb, —C(═NRc)NRaRb, —N(Rc)C(═O)NRaRb, —N(Rc)S(═O)mR5, —S(═O)2NRaRb, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxyl, alkylthiolyl, alkylamino, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, aryl and heteroaryl, and the like, wherein each R5, R6, R7, Ra, Rb, Rc, m and n carry the definitions described herein. At various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds disclosed herein are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the invention include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges. For example, the term “C1-C6 alkyl” is specifically intended to individually disclose methyl, ethyl, C3 alkyl, C4 alkyl, C5 alkyl, and C6 alkyl. At various places in the present specification, linking substituents are described. Where the structure clearly requires a linking group, the Markush variables listed for that group are understood to be linking groups. For example, if the structure requires a linking group and the Markush group definition for that variable lists “alkyl” or “aryl” then it is understood that the “alkyl” or “aryl” represents a linking alkylene group or arylene group, respectively. The term “alkyl” or “alkyl group” refers to a saturated linear or branched-chain monovalent hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, wherein the alkyl radical may be optionally substituted independently with one or more substituents described below. Unless otherwise specified, the alkyl group contains 1-20 carbon atoms. In one embodiment, the alkyl group contains 1-12 carbon atoms.

In yet another embodiment, some non-limiting examples of the compound disclosed herein, and their stereoisomer, tautomer, N-oxide, solvate, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, are shown in the following: TABLE 1 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) (61) (62) (63) (64) (65) (66) (67) (68) (69) Unless otherwise stated, all stereoisomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, salts, and pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of Formula (I) are within the scope of the invention. The compounds disclosed herein may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of compounds of Formula (I), including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers, atropisomers, conformers (rotamers) and geometric (cis/trans) isomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined. The compounds of Formula (I) may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention, as defined by the claims. The compounds of Formula (I) can be in the form of salts. In one embodiment, the salts are pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, and/or the mammal being treated therewith. In another embodiment, the salts are not necessarily pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and which may be useful as intermediates for preparing and/or purifying compounds of Formula (I) and/or for separating enantiomers of compounds of Formula (I). Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids, e.g., acetate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bromide/hydrobromide, bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulfate/sulfate, camphorsulfonate, chloride/hydrochloride, chlortheophyllonate, citrate, ethandisulfonate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hippurate, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurylsulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, mandelate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthoate, napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, octadecanoate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, polygalacturonate, propionate, stearate, succinate, subsalicylate, tartrate, tosylate and trifluoroacetate salts. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, sulfosalicylic acid, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be formed with inorganic and organic bases. Inorganic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, ammonium salts and metals from columns I to XII of the periodic table. In certain embodiments, the salts are derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, silver, zinc, and copper; particularly suitable salts include ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium salts. Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like. Certain organic amines include isopropylamine, benzathine, cholinate, diethanolamine, diethylamine, lysine, meglumine, piperazine and tromethamine. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from a basic or acidic moiety, by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting free acid forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base (such as Na, Ca, Mg, or K hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate or the like), or by reacting free base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate acid. Such reactions are typically carried out in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, use of non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile is desirable, where practicable. Lists of additional suitable salts can be found, e.g., in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences”, 20th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., (1985); and in “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use” by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002). Furthermore, the compounds disclosed herein, including their salts, can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents such as ethanol, DMSO, and the like, used for their crystallization. The compounds of the present invention may inherently or by design form solvates with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents (including water); therefore, it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. Any formula given herein is also intended to represent isotopically unenriched forms as well as isotopically enriched forms of the compounds. Isotopically enriched compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as 2H (deuterium, D), 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 17O, 18O, 18F, 31P, 32P, 35S, 36Cl, 125I, respectively. In another aspect, the compounds of the invention include isotopically enriched compounds as defined herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes, such as 3H, 14C and 18F, or those into which non-radioactive isotopes, such as 2H and 13C are present. Such isotopically enriched compounds are useful in metabolic studies (with 14C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example 2H or 3H), detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an 18F-enriched compound may be particularly desirable for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically-enriched compounds of Formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e., 2H or D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent of a compound of Formula (I). The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by the isotopic enrichment factor. The term “isotopic enrichment factor” as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope. If a substituent in a compound of this invention is denoted deuterium, such compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation). Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, acetone-d6, DMSO-d6.

As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle involved in giving form or consistency to the pharmaceutical composition. Each excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition when commingled such that interactions which would substantially reduce the efficacy of the compound disclosed herein when administered to a patient and interactions which would result in pharmaceutical compositions that are not pharmaceutically acceptable are avoided. In addition, each excipient must be pharmaceutically-acceptable, e.g., of sufficiently high purity. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients will vary depending upon the particular dosage form chosen. In addition, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for a particular function that they may serve in the composition. For example, certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the production of uniform dosage forms. Certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the production of stable dosage forms. Certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the carrying or transporting of the compound or compounds disclosed herein once administered to the patient from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to enhance patient compliance. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients comprise the following types of excipients: diluents, fillers, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, glidants, granulating agents, coating agents, wetting agents, solvents, co-solvents, suspending agents, emulsifiers, sweetners, flavoring agents, flavor masking agents, coloring agents, anticaking agents, hemectants, chelating agents, plasticizers, viscosity increasing agents, antioxidants, preservatives, stabilizers, surfactants, and buffering agents. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may serve more than one function and may serve alternative functions depending on how much of the excipient is present in the formulation and what other excipients are present in the formulation. Skilled artisans possess the knowledge and skill in the art to enable them to select suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients in appropriate amounts for use in the invention. In addition, there are a number of resources that are available to the skilled artisan which describe pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and may be useful in selecting suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Examples include Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Company), The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives (Gower Publishing Limited), and The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (the American Pharmaceutical Association and the Pharmaceutical Press).

Example A Compound Stability In Human and Rat Liver Microsomes Human or rat liver microsomes incubations were conducted in duplicate in polypropylene tubes. The typical incubation mixtures consisted of human or rat liver microsomes (0.5 mg protein/mL), compounds of interest (5 μM) and NADPH (1.0 mM) in a total volume of 200 μL potassium phosphate buffer (PBS, 100 mM, pH 7.4). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with PBS such that the final concentration of DMSO was 0.05%. The enzymatic reactions were commenced with the addition of protein after a 3-min preincubation and incubated in a water bath open to the air at 37° C. Reactions were terminated at various time points (0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 min) by adding equal volume of ice-cold acetonitrile. The samples were stored at −80° C. until LC/MS/MS assays. The concentrations of compounds in the incubation mixtures of human or rat liver microsomes were determined by a LC/MS/MS method. The ranges of the linearity in the concentration range were determined for each tested compounds. A parallel incubation was performed using denatured microsomes as the negative control, and reactions were terminated at various time points (0, 15, 60 min) after incubation at 37° C. Dextromethorphan (70 μM) was selected as the positive control, and reactions were terminated at various time points (0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 min) after incubation at 37° C. Both positive and negative control samples were included in each assay to ensure the integrity of the microsomal incubation system. Data Analysis The concentrations of compounds in human or rat liver microsome incubations were plotted as a percentage of the relevant zero time point control for each reaction. The in vivo CLint were extrapolated (ref.: Naritomi, Y.; Terashita, S.; Kimura, S.; Suzuki, A.; Kagayama, A.; and Sugiyama, Y.; Prediction of human hepatic clearance from in vivo animal experiments and in vitro metabolic studies with liver microsomes from animals and humans.

General Description for Kinase Assays Kinase assays can be performed by measurement of incorporation of γ-33P ATP into immobilized myelin basic protein (MBP). High binding white 384 well plates (Greiner) are coated with MBP (Sigma #M−1891) by incubation of 60 μL/well of 20 μg/mL MBP in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl) for 24 h at 4° C. Plates are washed 3× with 100 μL TBS. Kinase reactions are carried out in a total volume of 34 μL in kinase buffer (5 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 15 mM NaCl, 0.01% bovine gamma globulin (Sigma #I-5506), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% TritonX-100). Compound dilutions are performed in DMSO and added to assay wells to a final DMSO concentration of 1%. Each data point is measured in duplicate, and at least two duplicate assays are performed for each individual compound determination. Enzyme is added to final concentrations of 10 nM or 20 nM, for example. A mixture of unlabeled ATP and γ-33P ATP is added to start the reaction (2×106 cpm of γ-33P ATP per well (3000 Ci/mmole) and 10 μM unlabeled ATP, typically. The reactions are carried out for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. Plates are washed 7× with TBS, followed by the addition of 50 μL/well scintillation fluid (Wallac). Plates are read using a Wallac Trilux counter. This is only one format of such assays; various other formats are possible, as known to one skilled in the art. The above assay procedure can be used to determine the IC50 for inhibition and/or the inhibition constant, Ki. The IC50 is defined as the concentration of compound required to reduce the enzyme activity by 50% under the condition of the assay. The IC50 value is estimated by preparing a 10 point curve using a 1/2 log dilution series (for example, a typical curve may be prepared using the following compound concentrations: 3 μM, 1 μM, 0.3 μM, 0.1 μM, 0.03 μM, 0.01 μM, 0.003 μM, 0.001 μM, 0.0003 μM and 0 μM).

The kinase assays described herein were performed at Millipore UK Ltd, Dundee Technology Park, Dundee DD2 1SW, UK. Alternatively, the kinase activities of the compounds can be measured using KINOMEscan™, which is based on a competition binding assay that quantitatively measures the ability of a compound to compete with an immobilized, active-site directed ligand. The assay was performed by combining three components: DNA-tagged kinase; immobilized ligand; and a test compound. The ability of the test compound to compete with the immobilized ligand was measured via quantitative PCR of the DNA tag. For most assays, kinase-tagged T7 phage strains were prepared in an E. coli host derived from the BL21 strain. E. coli were grown to log-phase and infected with T7 phage and incubated with shaking at 32° C. until lysis. The lysates were centrifuged and filtered to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SEABLOCK™ (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% TWEEN®20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce nonspecific binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinases, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1× binding buffer (20% SEABLOCK™, 0.17×PBS, 0.05% TWEEN®20, 6 mM DTT). All reactions were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 0.135 mL. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour and the affinity beads were washed with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05% TWEEN®20). The beads were then re-suspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05% TWEEN®20, 0.5 μM non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 minutes. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by qPCR.
