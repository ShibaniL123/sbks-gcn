The present invention relates to a method for producing acrylic acid by dehydration of a C3 hydroxycarboxylic acid by contacting, at a temperature of more than 150° C., the hydroxycarboxylic acid with a mixture which is liquid at this temperature and comprises at least one metal salt of a C3 hydroxycarboxylic acid, and water. Acrylic acid is an important intermediate used in particular in the form of its polymers. The best-known use of acrylic acid is the production of superabsorbent polymers based on polyacrylic acid. Acrylic acid is conventionally chemically produced by oxidation of propene to give acrolein and subsequent further oxidation to afford acrylic acid. Newer methods seek to produce acrylic acid using other feedstocks. For instance, WO 2008/061819 describes a method for producing (meth)acrylic acid (the term (meth)acrylic acid is intended to encompass both methacrylic acid and acrylic acid) where cyclic esters are converted into (meth)acrylic acid in the presence of a catalyst. In recent years, economic and ecological considerations have spurred numerous attempts to use other feedstocks to produce acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, in particular renewable feedstocks. For instance, WO 2008/145737 describes the production of methacrylic acid by dehydration of 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid which was produced in biotechnological fashion from renewable feedstocks, in particular from carbohydrates and/or glycerol. The dehydration is performed in the liquid phase at a pressure in the range of from 200 to 500 mbar and a temperature in the range of from 200° C. to 230° C. in the presence of alkali metal ions as catalyst. DE-A 1 768 253 likewise describes such a method for producing methacrylic acid by dehydration of α-hydroxyisobutyric acid (HIBA) wherein said method is characterized in that HIBA is reacted in the liquid phase at a temperature of at least 160° C. in the presence of a dehydration catalyst consisting of a metal salt of alpha-hydroxyisobutyric acid. Particularly suitable here are the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts of HIBA which are produced in situ in an HIBA melt by reaction of suitable metal salts. This patent describes methacrylic acid yields of up to 95% based on HIBA and the feed for the continuous procedure consists of HIBA and about 1.5 wt % of HIBA alkali metal salt. Neither of the aforementioned documents describe a method for producing acrylic acid. WO 2013/155245 filed by Procter & Gamble describes the use of mixtures of phosphates as catalysts in the gas-phase dehydration of lactic acid to afford acrylic acid. Gas-phase dehydrations require that the reactants are initially converted into the gas phase which often results, for example under the influence of thermal energy on the reactants, in decomposition of the reactants which manifests itself as coking for example. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing acrylic acid from hydroxycarboxylic acids, which avoids the disadvantages of prior art methods. It has been found that, surprisingly, acrylic acid may be produced from hydroxycarboxylic acid by a method as described in the claims. The present invention thus provides a method for producing carboxylic acids which is claimed in the claims and further described in the description which follows. The method according to the invention has the advantage that acrylic acid may be prepared using lactic acid which may be obtained from renewable feedstocks. The method according to the invention has the further advantage that it can switch between the feedstocks 3-hydroxypropionic acid and lactic acid depending on the available feedstock source. A further advantage over a heterogeneous gas-phase dehydration in or at the phase boundary of the liquid phase is that prior complete evaporation of the organic acids may be eschewed. These evaporations suffer from severe coking since the evaporation temperature and decomposition temperature are close together. This can be minimized only by supplying a great deal of additional water which evaporates and also needs to be removed again in subsequent steps which is costly and inconvenient. Direct conversion at the salt melt makes it possible to eschew this severe dilution and to use concentrated solutions.

The present invention is more particularly described with reference to the figures FIG. 1 to FIG. 3 without any intention to restrict the invention to this embodiment. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of the experimental set-up used in Example 1. Two glass tubes lead into a heatable round-bottom flask R equipped with a stopper and a blade-stirrer. The left-hand glass tube G1 is long enough to protrude into any liquid mixture in the round-bottom flask and is used to supply substances into the round-bottom flask. The right-hand glass tube G2 is shorter and only reaches the gas space. The right-hand glass tube G2 is connected to a vacuum pump V. Between the vacuum pump and the round-bottom flask there is a cold trap C in which samples of condensed substances exiting the round-bottom flask via the right-hand glass tube may be taken in fractionated fashion. The figures FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 are chromatograms of the analyzed samples from Examples 1 and 2. The present invention is illustratively described in the examples which follow without any intention of limiting the invention, whose scope is determined by the entire description and the claims, to the embodiments referred to in the examples. EXAMPLES Example 1 Dehydration of 3-Hydroxypropionic Acid (3-HP) to Afford Acrylic Acid Into a 500 ml round-bottom flask belonging to an experimental apparatus of the type shown in FIG. 1 were initially charged 1 mol of 3-HP as a 60 wt % solution in water, 0.4 mol of K2CO3, 2 g of hydroquinone and 2 g of p-methoxyphenol (MEHQ). With stirring, this mixture was heated to 180° C. over one hour using a heating mantle and the water thereby distilled over was discarded. Via glass tube G1 which protruded about 1 cm into the liquid mixture, which mixture had a height of 5 cm at this point, about 120 g/h of a composition comprising 0.1% by mass of hydroquinone, 0.1% by mass of MEHQ, and 3-HP up to 99.8% by mass as a 22 wt % solution in water were introduced into the flask using an HPLC pump. A vacuum pump was used to apply via glass tube G2 an under pressure of about 95 mbar for the duration of the experiment. The gaseous substances withdrawn via G2 were liquefied and collected in fractionated fashion via a glass condenser (descending intensive condenser). The remaining vaporous low boilers were condensed in a cold trap. The isolated fractions were analyzed by HPLC. This was done using a Shimadzu Prominence instrument and a Nucleogel Sugar 810 H column (MACHEREY-NAGEL). The eluent employed was a 5 mM H2SO4 solution (0.7 mL/min). As is shown by the analysis, all distillates and the vapors condensed in the cold trap contain primarily free acrylic acid as well as small amounts of unconverted 3-HP and water (FIG. 2). Example 2 Dehydration of Lactic Acid to Afford Acrylic Acid Example 1 was repeated except that a 60 wt % aqueous solution of lactic acid was used in place of the aqueous 3-HP solution. Comparison of the distillate chromatogram with that of acrylic acid demonstrated successful conversion into acrylic acid for this experiment too (FIG. 3). As is apparent from the HPLC analyses, the method according to the invention produced acrylic acid from both 3-HP and lactic acid. Example 3 Dehydration of Lactic Acid to Afford Acrylic Acid Into a 500 ml round-bottom flask of an experimental apparatus of the type shown in FIG. 1, which was equipped with a heating means, were initially charged 1 mol of lactic acid as a 90 wt % solution in water, 2 mol %, based on the lactic acid, of salt, 2 g of hydroquinone and 2 g of p-methoxyphenol (MEHQ). With stirring, this mixture was heated to 180° C. over one hour using a heating mantle and the water thereby distilled over was discarded. Via glass tube G1 which protruded about 1 cm into the liquid mixture, which mixture had a height of 5 cm at this point, about 120 g/h of a composition comprising 0.1% by mass, based on the composition, of hydroquinone, 0.1% by mass of MEHQ and lactic acid up to 99.8% by mass as a 45 wt % solution in water were introduced into the flask using an HPLC pump. The pot temperature was set to about 300° C. during the reaction. A vacuum pump was used to apply an under pressure via glass tube G2 of more than 100 mbar and less than 1 bar for the duration of the experiment. The gaseous substances withdrawn via G2 were liquefied and collected in fractionated fashion via a glass condenser (descending intensive condenser). The remaining vaporous low boilers were condensed in a cold trap. The isolated fractions were analyzed by HPLC. This was done using a Shimadzu Prominence instrument and a Nucleogel Sugar 810 H column (MACHEREY-NAGEL). The eluent employed was a 5 mM H2SO4 solution (0.7 mL/min). The results are listed in table 1. The salts employed were produced as per WO 2013/155245 A2 or obtained from the sources identified therein or from comparable sources in the highest obtainable purity.
