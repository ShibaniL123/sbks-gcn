[Synthesis Example13-4] Synthesis of Compound 77
The same procedure as in Reaction Scheme 3-10 of Synthesis Example 3 was carried out, with the exception of using Intermediate 13-c and Intermediate 13-b instead of Intermediate 3-g and Intermediate 1-l, respectively, to afford Compound 77 (3.5 g): yield 41.3%
