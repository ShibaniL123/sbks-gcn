The third step The synthesis of Compound I-27
To a mixed solution of Compound 85 (600mg, 1.29mmol) in methanol (4 mL) and THF (4 mL) was added 2 mol / L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (2.23 mL, 4.45 mmol), and the mixture was heated under reflux and stirred for 5.5 hours. The reaction mixture was adjusted to pH7 with a 1 mol / L hydrochloric acid. After the addition of HP, the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by ODS column chromatography (water-acetonitrile) to yield Compound I-27 (195mg, yield 46%) as a white solid.
