Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an oil-in-water type one-part hair dye composition. Background of the Invention A technology concerning a one-part hair dye composition that colors hair by penetration of a direct dye into the hair, namely a hair manicure, has been heretofore developed. However due to a larger molecular size of the dye, the dye cannot penetrate into the hair easily and the dyeability and the color durability are not satisfactory. To solve the problem, a solvent promoting the penetration into the hair has been formulated, which has remarkably improved the dyeability and the color durability (Patent Document 1). However, the addition of such solvent has raised another problem that skin is dyed more intensely than hair by the dye due to a structural difference between the hair and the skin. For solving the problem, a hair dye composition has been proposed, in which as the penetration promoter together with a specific organic solvent a hydrocarbon oil and a polyether-modified silicone are used (Patent Document 2). Thus, coloring of the skin has been slightly reduced, but not yet to a satisfactory level. Further, since the composition according to the Patent Document 2 is a water-in-oil type emulsion, the feel during rinsing is also not fully satisfactory. There is an additional problem that, when formulated into an aerosol type hair dye, the reduction effect on the skin coloring becomes compromised. Meanwhile, a hair dye composition reducing the skin coloring by using a specific lactone compound has been proposed (Patent Document 3). According to the technology, the skin coloring can be reduced without spoiling the feel during rinsing, but the color durability is not satisfactory and perfumery becomes extremely difficult due to the characteristic odor of the lactone compound.

In this connection, in the case of an aerosol hair dye, the aforedescribed contents of the components other than the propellant represent the concentrations in the neat liquid (total composition excluding the propellant). Examples Example 1 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 Each oil-in-water type one-part hair dye composition according to the compositions shown in Table 1 was prepared and evaluation on "hair dyeability", "skin coloring" and "hair smoothness" were carried out. (Evaluation methods) "Hair dyeability" The hair dye composition 1 g was evenly applied to a tress of 1 g of white goat hair and left acting at 30Â°C for 15 min. Then the tress was rinsed with 40Â°C water, subjected to shampooing twice with a shampoo (added with sodium polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate; pH 7), and single treatment with a rinse (added with stearyl trimethylammonium chloride; pH 5), and then dried. The color (immediately after dyeing) was measured by a colorimeter (Colorimeter CR-400 from Minolta) and the results are shown in Table 1. Thereafter a cycle of 2-times shampooing and 1-time conditioning treatment was repeated 10 cycles, and the tress was dried. The color (after the 10th hair washing) was measured by the colorimeter, and the results are shown in Table 1. The hair dyeability and the skin coloring described in the next paragraph are expressed herein by the color difference ÎE in the Lab color system as defined by the following formula. Thereby a higher ÎE means higher hair dyeability or skin coloring described below. Further, it is broadly known that, if ÎE values of objects to be measured are different by 2 or higher, the difference of color changes therebetween can be visually clearly recognized. ÎE=ÎL2+Îa2+Îb21/2 "Skin coloring" The hair dye composition was evenly applied to the human brachial region in an amount of 1 g/cm2, and left at 30Â°C for 15 min. Then the skin was rinsed by warm water, shampooed twice and the color was measured by the colorimeter. The degree of the skin coloring was rated by the following criteria according to opinions of 10 specialists forming a panel and the results are shown in Table 1. The number of the specialists, who opined that the skin coloring was of no concern, is also shown. A: 6 or more specialists opined that the skin coloring was no concern.B: 4 to 5 specialists opined that the skin coloring was no concern.C: 3 or less specialists opined that the skin coloring was no concern. "Hair smoothness after drying" To the test tresses made of 5 g of about 15-cm-long untreated Japanese female hair, 2.5 g of the respective hair dye compositions were applied. The tresses were rinsed with warm water, subjected to shampooing and treatment with a rinse, and blow-dried similarly as described above. The hair smoothness was rated during rinsing and after blow-drying by the following criteria according to the opinions of 10 specialists forming a panel and the results are shown in Table 1. The number of the specialists, who opined that the hair was smooth, is also shown. A: 6 or more specialists opined that the hair was smooth.B: 4 to 5 specialists opined that the hair was smooth.C: 3 or less specialists opined that the hair was smooth. Example 2 and Comparative Examples 4 to 5 The oil-in-water type one-part hair dye compositions according to the compositions shown in Table 2 were prepared and evaluation on "hair dyeability", "skin coloring" and "hair smoothness" were carried out according to the similar methods and criteria as described above. Example 3 and Comparative Example 6 Each oil-in-water type one-part hair dye composition (neat liquid) according to the compositions shown in Table 3 was prepared, and propellant aerosol hair dyes were produced using LPG. The evaluation on "hair dyeability", "skin coloring" and "hair smoothness" were carried out according to the similar methods and criteria as described above. With all of the oil-in-water type one-part hair dye compositions described below, the hair dyeability and feel were good and the scalp and skin coloring was negligible.
