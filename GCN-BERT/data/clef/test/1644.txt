Intermediate 21: 3-Bromo-5-(difluoromethyl)-2-isopropyl-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine
Step A: 3-Bromo-2-isopropylpyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine hydrobromide. To a solution of 2-isopropylpyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine (Intermediate 20, 170 mg, 1.1 mmol) in acetic acid (4.3 mL) was added bromine (147 μL, 2.9 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 70° C. for 4 h. To the reaction mixture was added additional bromine (74 μL, 1.4 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 70° C. for 4 h. To the reaction mixture was added a third portion of bromine (100 μL, 1.9 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 70° C. for 2 h. To the reaction mixture was added a fourth portion of bromine (100 μL, 1.9 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 70° C. for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to rt and poured into ice water (20 mL). The aqueous layer was decanted from the precipitate. The crude product was triturated with diethyl ether (10 mL) to afford the title compound as a brown solid (247 mg, 72% yield).
