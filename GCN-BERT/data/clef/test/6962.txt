WE CLAIM:- i A truncation error compensating device for compensation of. truncation errors in a digital filter, which compensating devlÂ¢ is connected such as to precede the digital filter and has a device input [a] for receiving a s amI,led signal to be subsequently processed in the digital filter, which compensating device comprises a digital adder and a controllable switch and a memory and a polarity sensing unit, the digital adder having a first .input connected to the device input and a second Input m ;r connected to an output of the controllable switch, the me y storing a value corresponding to a mean truncation error in the dlgi%al filter and having outputs connected to inputs o th controllable switch, the polarity sensing unit having an iLpu% connected to the devlce input and sensing the polarity of the sampled signal relative to a given zero level, the controllable switch having a control input connected ,to an output -of. the polarity sensing unit, the polarity sensing unit controlling the controllable switch to transfer from the memory to the second -input of the digital adder a positive value when. the -polarity sensing unit senses, a positive sampled signal but a negative value when %he polarity sensing unit senses a negative sampled signal, %he dlgi%al adder adding the sampled signal, and the value from the controllable switch and having an output oonneoted "to., %he input of the digital filter for delivering to the digital filterthe sum Of he sampled sIEnaland %he.value. 2 A %runoation error compensating devioe for compensation of truncation errors in a digital filter mubmtantiallF aa herein demoribed with reference to the accompanier drawings.
