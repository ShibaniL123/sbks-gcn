SILICA-FILLED ENR MASTERBATCH AND CROSS LINKABLE ELASTOMERIC COMPOSITION FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a cross linkable elastomeric composition and processes of preparing the same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conventional solid tyre on the market today generally is used at industrial area that require the solid tyre to. have puncture resistance, able to undertake relatively high loads, and having good abrasion and cut resistance properties. These solid tyres are generally manufactured using synthetic rubber where the source of materials is depleting or partially blended with natural rubber to achieve the require properties. The tyre provides satisfactory performance when the tyre is operated on even surfaces such as concrete ground in a well maintained factory. However, the tyre might not perform effectively when it is used on deteriorated, uneven road or wet surface such as quarries, mines and mills. If the tyre handling is not performing effectively, it may cause injury to vehicle occupant or people around the vehicle. The foregoing describes the prior known limitations encountered by conventional solid tyres and their users. A co-pending Malaysian Patent Application No. PI 2011004684 describes a method for preparing silica-filled epoxide natural rubber (ENR) masterbatch in latex comprising (i) 100 parts by weight of elastomer containing ENR 25 latex with 25% mole of epoxidation; with (ii) oil emulsion either aromatic or paraffinic or naphthenic oil in the form of 50% with 2 to 3 parts to the latex; with (iii) antioxidant in the form of a 30% dispersion with 2 to 3 parts to the latex; with (iv) silica in the form of a 10% to 50% dispersion with 10 to 70 parts to the latex; and (ν) methods of coagulating silica-ENR mixtures either via (a) stirring only, (b) stirring with heat, or (c) stirring with acid to produce ready compounded silica-filled ENR masterbatch that is mainly directed to alleviate the problem of agglomeration of silica formed in rubber from prior known dry rubber processing methods. However, there still exists a major hurdle in the existing and known rubber masterbatches whereby it is very difficult to attain both good traction/ wet grip properties and low rolling resistance at the same time in a tyre tread composition. Hence as apparent from the above said, it is imperative to provide for suitable rubber masterbatch preparations and the crosslinkable elastomeric compositions comprising the same, capable of being used in the production of crosslinked rubber products suitable for industrial applications, particularly in the production of solid tyres and specifically for solid tyre outer layers that would overcome the existing prior art problem of attaining both good traction/ wet grip properties and low rolling resistance in the same tyre tread composition. Moreover, there is a strong need in the art to provide for such suitable rubber masterbatch preparations and crosslinkable elastomeric compositions comprising the same as tyre tread compositions which provides both good wet traction and low rolling resistance performance of crosslinked rubber products especially solid tyres, specifically solid tyre outer layers, and also favour improved performance in terms of both better tyre handling and less fuel consumption of the automobiles using such tyres additionally imparting the desired comfort index to the vehicle occupants. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In the present invention there is provided a silica-filled epoxide natural rubber (ENR) masterbatch as a ready compounded masterbatch obtained from latex stage preparation comprising antioxidant, oil emulsion, silica dispersion and ENR latex in a form which is adapted to favour producing crosslinkable rubber products with both good wet traction/wet grip index in the range of 170-180 and low rolling resistance index in the range of 90-98 for superior performance based crosslinkable rubber products.

It is thus a finding of the present invention, whereby it is possible to obtain a crosslinkable elastomeric composition adapted to favour producing crosslinkable rubber products with both good wet traction/wet grip index in the range of 170-180 and low rolling resistance index in the range of 90-98 for superior performance of said crosslinkable rubber products only when said cross linkable elastomeric composition comprises a silica-filled ENR elastomer as masterbatch preferably as a ready compounded masterbatch obtained from latex stage preparation comprising antioxidant, oil emulsion, silica dispersion and ENR latex, and wherein said silica filled-epoxide natural rubber (ENR) elastomer as a ready compounded masterbatch preferably comprises 100 parts by weight of epoxidised natural rubber with 25% mole of epoxidation and 20 to 60 parts by weight of silica.

There is no limitation for the choice of silica for the present invention. Silica, such as fumed or pyrogenic silica with precipitated or hydrated amorphous silica, is known and is commercially available or known as silicon dioxide (Si02) and contain different structures, particle size and surface area. They are preferably used on tyre products such as Ultrasil® VN3 or Zeosil® 1165ΜΡ. There is no limitation for the choice of vulcanization accelerator used in the present invention. Examples thereof include guanidines, sulfonamides, thiazoles, thiurams and the likes. In the elastomeric composition of the present invention for solid tyre tread, carbon black is preferably mixed for coloring, reinforcement and abrasion resistance improvement. There is no limitation for the type of carbon black. However, it is used in tyre products with a specific area of nitrogen adsorption between 30 to 200 ml/1 OOg and an adsorption amount of compressed dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is 30 to 150 ml/1 OOg. Examples of carbon black are Super Abrasion Furnace (SAF), Intermediate SAF (ISAF), High Abrasion Furnace (HAF) and Easy Processing Channel (EPC). The amount of carbon black used is preferably 5 to 15 parts by weight with a balance between reinforcement and rolling resistance. The elastomeric composition for solid tyre outer layer of the present invention obtained from can be applied to fabricate solid tyre by conventional manufacturing method. As the solid tyre rotates, it experiences repeated cycle of deformation and recovery using deformable material - rubber. Tangent delta (tan δ) is expressed by the ratio of the measurement of energy lost as heat (loss modulus - G”) versus the energy stored (storage modulus - G’). This ratio represents the mechanical loss angle and is expressed as G”/G’. Good wet traction or wet grip is predicted by a high value for tan δ at OO. Low rolling resistance is predicted by low tan δ value at 60°C and higher temperature. Good (high) wet traction and low rolling resistance usually require compromise on the part of the rubber compounder. Prior to the present invention, it was a challenge to obtain both these properties in the same tyre tread composition.

The elastomeric compositions for solid tyre using silica-ENR masterbatch are given in Table 1. The mixing was carried out at two different stages. At the first stage, all the ingredients were mixed with the exception of sulphur, the TBBS and the DPG in a Banbury internal mixer (1.6 L) for about 5 minutes. The elastomeric composition was dumped at a temperature of 150°C. At the second stage mixing, the remaining ingredients of sulphur, the TBBS and the DPG were mixed on a two-roll mill.

In examples 3, 4 and 5, the crosslinked manufactured product obtained from said elastomeric composition shows significant improvement in wet traction with slight reduction on rolling resistance. Many other factors play a major role for fuel economy that is related to rolling resistance of a tyre. These include vehicle weight, vehicle aerodynamic design and vehicle conditions such as alignment of vehicle’s tandem and steer axles. Others factor include tyre design, inflation pressure, road surface and operating temperature. Comparative example 3 generally indicates better performance for wet traction on tyre handling. Good tensile properties and improvement on tear strength that were exhibited in example 3 indicate better puncture resistance. Generally, the time require to add, incorporate and disperse silica into the rubber will be omitted during compounding of solid tyre when silica-filled ENR 25 masterbatch is used. This results in higher productivity and lower production cost. It is thus made possible, by way of the present advancement, to provide a crosslinkable elastomeric composition comprising silica-filled ENR masterbatch as a ready compounded masterbatch obtained by latex stage preparation which comprises antioxidant, oil emulsion, silica dispersion and ENR latex that is adapted to favour to produce crosslinkable rubber products with good wet traction/wet grip index in the range of 170-180 and low rolling resistance index in the range of 90-98 for superior performance. Advantageously, the said silica filled-epoxide natural rubber (ENR) elastomer comprises 100 parts by weight of epoxidised natural rubber with 25% mole of epoxidation and 20 to 60 parts by weight of silica. Additionally, the elastomeric compositions in accordance with the present invention also provides for moderate hardness value, high tensile strength and good elongation at break wherein such good tensile properties and improvement on tear strength is also indicative of better puncture resistance. 1.
