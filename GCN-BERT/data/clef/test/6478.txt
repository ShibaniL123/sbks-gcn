ROTARY FEEDER VALVE This invention relates to a rotary feeder valve. More parti¬ cularly, the invention relates to a rotary feeder valve for introduc¬ ing wood chips to a vertical digester. This is a division of applicant's copending Canadian appli¬ cation. Serial No. 971,134, filed September 23, 1966. The conversion from vertical batch digesters to continuous vertical digesters has not proceed with the speed expected. This stemmed from the fact that the vertical digesters available could not provide a uniform product at high efficiency. This problem has been met and solved by the invention, and the provision of apparatus and method for this purpose constitutes an important object of the invention. More specifically, the invention provides means and procedures for making various adjustments within a vertical digester quickly and accurately so as to produce a product of substantially unvarying quality notwithstanding changes in the character of the reactant wood chips. A more specific object is to provide a vertical digester and method where¬ in the usual "sawdust" accompanying the chips can be digested<, Another specific object of this invention is to provide an improved means for introducing the wood chips to the digester. Another factor contributing to the efficiency of operation of a digester is the power required. By virtue of the construction and arrangement of the various co-acting parts in the inventive di¬ gester, the mechanical horsepower input and steam demand in general is minimal in terms of the results obtained - the provision of apparatus for achieving this desired end constitutes another object of the in¬ vention. Other objects and advantages, both general and specific, may be seen in the details of construction and operation of the invention as set down in the ensuing portion of the specification. The invention is described in conjunction with the accom¬ panying drawing, in which — FIG. 1 is an elevational view, generally in vertical sec¬ tion of a vertical digester embodying teachings of this invention; FIG. 2 is a transverse section taken along the line 2-2 of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a longitudinal sectional view of a modified form of circulation liquor feed pipe; FIG. 4 is an elevational view of the inventive digester with the piping associated therewith; FIGS. 5-9 relate to a rotary feeder valve found at the top of the digester pictured in FIG. 1 and wherein FIG. 5 is a verti¬ cal sectional view through the rotary feeder; FIG. 6 is an end ele¬ vational view partially in section; FIG. 7 is a side elevational view, partially in section of the rotary feeder; FIG. 8 is an end elevational view of the rotor portion of the rotary feeder; FIG. 9 is a side elevational view of the rotor portion, partially in sec¬ tion of the rotary feeder; FIG. 10 is a fragmentary, elevational view of the top por- tion of FIG. 1 showing the mechanical power connections to the two rotary feeders; FIGS. 11 and 12 relate to the bottom portion of the diges¬ ter and, more particularly, to the removal plow and wherein FIG. 11 is an elevational view partially in section of the bottom portion of the digester; and FIG. 12 is a top plan view of the removal plow. In the illustration given, and with particular reference to FIG. 1, the portions of the inventive vertical digester that deal with the wood chips and pulp are shown, (the piping details being substantially omitted, these being seen in detail in FIG. 4). In FIG. 1, the numeral 30 designates generally the digester proper which is seen to be a vertically elongated chamber arranged to re¬ ceive wood chips at the top and discharge digested pulp at the bot¬ tom. To introduce the chips at the top, a metering screw mech¬ anism generally designated 31 is employed which is equipped with an inlet as at 32 communicating with a wood chip source (not shown). The chips from the metering screw mechanism are discharged into a low pressure rotary feeder valve generally designated 33 and this, in turn, forces the chips into a low pressure pre-steamer generally designated 34. From the pre-steamer 34, the chips move into a high pressure rotary feeder valve generally designated 35. The bottom outlet of the feeder valve mechanism 35 is coupled to the top por¬ tion of the digester 30 wherein the chips encounter a chip submer¬ gence screw mechanism generally designated 36. As the wood chips leave the bottom end of the submergence screw mechanism, they are subjected to steaming in a zone designated 37. All the steam for x pre-steaming is advantageously introduced through the high pressure feeder valve 35 where it is employed to purge chips from the poclcets whereby the same steam performs a dual function. Also, for this pur- pose, high pressure steam may be introduced by line 38. The next stage in the digester 30 is a liquor impregnation zone 39 - this being achieved by virtue of introducing white liquor, black liquor, or a combination of white liquor and black liquor through supply manifold 40. The manifold 40 serves as a header for a plurality of axially extending discharge pipes 41 which are seen to terminate, î«s.* ' have their lower discharge ends positioned, slightly below the upper level of the zone 39. After passing through the liquor impregnation zone 39, the chips encounter the upper portion of the cooking zone (the liquor circulation zone), which is designated by the numeral 42. For cooking in this zone, liquor is recirculated from the header 43 communicating with strainers 44 and delivered to supply pipe 43a to a plurality of axially extending discharge pipes 45 (the arrangement being seen in FIG. 2). A modified form of adjustable circulation liquor supply pipe is seen in FIG. 3 and designated 45". Following the passage of chips through the liquor circula¬ tion portion of the cooking zone, the chips then pass through the re¬ mainder of the cooking zone which is designated 46, i..e,., the portion below the strainers 44. Here, there is no recirculation of cooking liquor. Ultimately, the chips reach the lower portion of the diges¬ ter where they pass through a cooling zone 47. From the zone 47, the chips are withdrawn by means of a blow valve 48 from which they are delivered to means (not shown) for further processing. It is believed that the details of construction of the digester and associ¬ ated parts will be better understood from a brief description of the operation of the digester on wood chips introduced as at 32 and for that purpose the following generalized description is set down. GENERALIZED DESCRIPTION Two pre-stearning stages are provided. The first stage is provided by the pre-steamer 34 in a horizontal tube above the diges¬ ter 30. The various framing members and other supports have been omitted for the sake of clarity although various pedestals and sup¬ ports as at F (see the extreme lower portion of FIG. 1) are provided. The pre-steaming at 34 advantageously may be achieved at approximate¬ ly 250oF, steam. For this purpose, flash steam is obtained from high temperature black liquor removed from the digester at the end of the cooking zone. I have found that the use of flash steam can reduce the overall steam consumption approximately 17%. Pre-steam¬ ing, as contemplated herein, conditions the wood chips for faster liquid impregnation. Air inside the chips can impede liquor impreg- ','' '''* 'U' '' 83652 nation, while pre-steaming compresses this air and tends to purge it from the chips. Further, pre-steaming adds moisture to the chips which helps liquor impregnation, the chip with higher moisture con¬ tent being more receptive to liquor. Air surrounding the chips fed into the low pressure pre-steamer is displaced by the steam and purged from the system through the low pressure rotary feeder valve 33 and the relief line 33a. The second stage of pre-steaming takes place in the dome portion 49 of the digester 30. The steaming zone 37 previously re- ferred to is at full digester temperature, as high as 370oF. I find that since this temperature is extremely high, the retention time for chips in the zone 37 should be ordinarily of the order of two minutes or less. The zone 37 can be seen to occupy the space between the bottom flight 36a of the chip submergence mechanism and the liquor level 39a in the digester 30. The retention time in the high temper¬ ature steaming zone can be varied from zero to the desired time by adjusting the liquor level as at 39a. In addition to greater air displacement and higher chip moisture, high temperature pre-steaming is beneficial because the chips are hotter than the liquor in which they are eventually submerged. Any steam which may be inside the chips when the chips are submerged is condensed and causes the chips to soak up liquor faster. The vapor space as at 49a within the dome 49 is a collection point for air and volatiles which are continuously relieved from the digester. Provision is made as at 49b for the removal of these non-condensibles, i.e../ air, turpentine, etc. The liquor impregnation zone extends from the level 39a down to the bottom of the circulating liquor return pipes 45 where hot circulating liquor enters the digester to bring the charge up to cooking temperature. The temperature in the impregnation zone 39 is approximately 250°F, resulting from the mixture of hot chips and I 873652 f condensate with the comparatively cool white liquor introduced through the manifold 40 and discharge pipes 41. The retention time in this zone is somewhat dependent upon the character of the chip. For example, but shorter chips can use a proportionately less time, white liquor, blaclc liquor or a mixture of white liquor and black liquor is con¬ tinuously added to the top of the zone 39 through a plurality of per¬ forated supply pipes 41 which are advantageously disposed across the cross-section of the digester 30. The impregnation liquor enters the liquor pool well below the top surface 39a to prevent the same from being heated by steam in the digester dome 49. no provision is made in the illustrated embodiment for circulation of the liquor in the impregnation zone 3 9. The downard flow of the impregnation liquor with the chips is positive because the digester liquor level 39a is controlled. The upper portion of the cooking zone has been referred to as the liquor circulation zone and has been designated 42. Circula¬ ting liquor at cooking temperature is withdrawn from the digester through the strainers 44 and collection header 43 returned to the top of the cooking zone through the supply manifold 43a and the discharge pipes 45. Incident to withdrawal of liquor, it may be heated directly by in¬ troduction of steam or indirectly or a combination of both forms. Chips and liquor moving down from the impregnation zone 39 are brought up to cooking temperatures when they enter the top of the cooking zone as at 42a. The temperature of the cooking zone may range from 340° to 360ÔF, depending upon mill conditions. The retention time of chips in the circulation zone 42 is approximately 30 minutes. This permits several liquor turnovers in the time required for the chips to pass through the zone. High circulation and even liquor distribution give a fast rise to cooking temperature and assure even liquor concentra¬ tion throughout. The bottom of the cooking zone as at 46 does not have liquor circulation. In this zone, the liquor and chips move downwardly together because of the automatically controlled flow of pulp leaving the bottom of the digester. Retention time in this zone The cooking zone ends near the bottom of the digester where cooling liquor is added as at 50 to reduce the blowing temperature to about 220oP. The cooling liquor in addition is controlled by a liquid- level controller to maintain a constant liquor level in the digester at 39 and is independent of the liquor and pulp leaving the digester under normal operating conditions. As mentioned previously the lowest segment of the digester contains a cooling zone 47. In this zone, a plow generally designa¬ ted 51 turns to move the cooked pulp toward the axis of the digester for discharge. Nozzles for the introduction of cooling liquor are mounted on the plow arms and on a central standpipe as at 52 and 53, respectively, for the introduction of cooling liquor. This results in cooling the pulp uniformly and gives a uniform pulp consistency. The retention times and temperatures in all zones are ad¬ justable and changeable during operation. Retention time in both pre-steaming zones is also adjustable during operation. Retention time in the liquor impregnating zone can be changed by changing the length of the liquor return pipes 45'. changing the retention time in the liquor impregnation zone changes the time in the cooking zone. The production rate, which determines the cooking time, is controlled by the automatic blow valve 48 operated through a flow meter 54. The The controlled flow rate of pulp from the digester, together with automatic control of the chip feed to the digester to keep it com- pletely filled at all times, assures a constant cooking time. DIGESTER PIPING Reference is now made to FIG. 4 which shows the digester chamber 30 previously described in combination with the various pipes utilized for conducting fluids to the various zones. Reference was previously made to the flash steam introduced to the discharge of the low pressure rotary feeder 33 or pre-steamer 34. This steam which may be at 15-20 psi (about 250oF) is developed in a flash tank (see the right-hand central portion of FIG. 4) and is delivered through a line 56 to the pre-steamer 34,. A high pressure steam branch line 57 coming from the large steam main 58 (see the lower right-hand portion of FIG. 4) not only delivers steam via the line 38 to the discharge of the high pressure rotary feeder valve 35 or dome section 49 of the digester 30, but is equipped with a further branch line 59 for low pressure steam to be delivered to the line 56 upon startup. For that purpose, a pressure reducing valve 60 is mounted in the line 59. The steam is delivered to the rotary valve 33 and thus, in addition to purging the valve pockets, also supplies the pre-steamer 34. The flash steam in the tank 55 is developed from black liquor removed from the digester by lower strainers as at 61 and is caused to flow through a pipe 62 to the flash tank 55. The remaining liquid in the tank 55 is removed through a discharge line 63 to an intermediate black liquor tank (not shown). A portion of the black liquor removed from the lower strainers 61 flows through line 64 to the black liquor pump 65 (see the lower left-hand portion of FIG. 4), then to a heat exchange 66 and pipe 67 for union with white liquor flowing in pipe 68. The com¬ bined streams flow through manifold 40 (see the upper left-hand por¬ tion of FIG. 4) into the supply pipes 41. The supply pipes 41 provide the impregnation liquor previously referred to which develops the zone 39. For developing the recirculation liquor portion of the cooking zone, ±_.e_. , the zone 42, recirculation liquor is removed from the upper strainers 44 through the pipe 43 and after passing through the pump 69, (see the lower left-hand portion of PIG. 4) flows through the supply manifold 43a to the recirculation supply pipes 45. As can be seen from FIG. 2, these pipes 45 are spaced through the cross-section of the digester proper so as to achieve uniform liquor conditions. Additionally, a branch line 45a is in- stalled on the axis of the digester 30 so as to further achieve uni¬ formity of distribution of the circulating liquor. The strainers 44 utilize high pressure steam or liquor or a mixture thereof for both cleaning and heating. High pressure steam or liquor or a mixture thereof is also delivered to the lower strain¬ ers 61 via the branch line 71 (see the lower right-hand portion of FIG. 4). The lowermost zone, i.e.-, the cooling zone 47, is developed by introducing cooled black liquor from the line 63a (see the lower right-hand portion of FIG. 4) which flows through a pump 72 and heat exchanger 73 before entering the pipe 50. By regulating the flow of cooling liquor via valve 50a (see FIG. 4) the upper level 39a is con¬ trolled. The black liquor from the flash tank 55 is used to cool the bottom zone of the digester and any pulp which may have escaped through the bottom screens with the black liquor is returned to the digester, thereby eliminating the need for supplemental screening of the ribers from the black liquor. The following example sets down typical operating condi¬ tions and values for the various operational portions of the digester just described. EXAMPLE In this example, the digester capacity was 225 air-dried tons of pine or aspen per day which when oven-dried had a weight of pounds per cubic foot. This also was the weight of chips in the impregnation zone and the average weight of chips in the cooking zone was 15 pounds per cubic foot. For this, it was necessary to feed 38,333 pounds of oven-dried chips per hour to the digester. The moisture content of the chips was 40% which gave a weight of water in the chips of 25,555 pounds per hour. The temperature of the chips in storage was 80oF, and the temperature of the chips in the pre-steamer was 250oF. The retention time of the chips in the pre-steamer was 2 minutes and the temperature of the chips in the dome of the digester was 300°F. The retention time of the chips in the dome of the diges¬ ter was 3 minutes. The temperature of the impregnation zone 39 was 248°F, with a retention time of 20 minutes. The temperature in the cooking zone was 3450F, and the retention time was 60 minutes. To develop cooking, the active alkali (NcO) required was 16% and the concentration of the alkali in the liquor was 6 pounds per cubic foot. The white liquor feed rate to the digester was 70,022 pounds per hour repre¬ senting 128 gallons per minute. The temperature of the white liquor in storage was 180oF, while the temperature of the circulating liquor was 3650F, at a rate of 1,297 gpm. The pressure in the steam main was 170 psi yielding 3650F, steam temperature in the dome of the digester at 150 psi. The steam pressure in the pre-steamer 34 was 15 psi and 6,873 pounds per hour of steam was required to pre-steam the wood in the pre-steamer and 2,630 pounds per hour of steam was required to pre-steam the wood in the dome of the digester. 14,871 pounds per hour of steam was re¬ quired to heat the circulating liquor. Sufficient black liquor was removed at the bottom of the digester to develop 3,998 pounds per hour of flash steam to the pre-steamer tube. The net steam consump¬ tion per ton of pulp was 2,362 pounds per ton. The black liquor delivered to the flash tank 55 was 46,643 pounds per hour and of this, 42,645 pounds per hour was returned to intermediate storage. The temperature of the blown pulp was 220OF, while the temperature of the cooled black liquid fed to the bot¬ tom of the digester was 150oF, at 330 gallons per minute. For this, 137,799 pounds per hour of black liquor makeup for main storage was required. Cooling water was also required in the amount of 99 gpm with a temperature at the inlet of 60oF, and a temperature at the outlet of the heat exchangers of 160oF. The consistency of the blown pulp was 5.9% and the percent of solids in the black liquor to the blow tank was 19.5% represen¬ ting 3,499 pounds of solids per ton of pulp to the evaporator. The rotary feeder valve mechanism previously referred to in connection with the upper portion of FIG. 1 will now be described in detail and with particular reference to FIGS. 5-9. ROTARY FEEDERS In FIG. 5, a rotary feeder valve 35 is seen in partial sec¬ tion and which is generally of the form disclosed in my prior patent. No. 2,9335208. In FIG. 5, a generally cylindrical outer casing 74 is seen to provide a mounting for a rotor 75. The rotor 75 has a plurality of radially extending vanes 76 which define pockets 77 for conducting predetermined quantities of wood chips either from the metering screw mechanism 31 to the pre-steamer 34 or from the pre-steam 34 to the chip submergence screw mechanism 36. In my pre¬ vious patent, I described various crossover pipes 78 and 79 which communicated pockets on opposite sides of the rotor for the purpose of effecting a gradual reduction in steam pressure. The steam pressure at the inlet of the high pressure rotary feeder 35 is ordin¬ arily of the order of 15 psi. The pressure in the dome 40 of the di¬ gester 30 is ordinarily of the order of 150 psi. To introduce chips into the dome, purge steam of the order of 160 psi is introduced in¬ to the bottom pockets as at 80 (see also FIG. 7). Thus, a pocket leaving the discharge 81 of the housing 74 would ordinarily contain 150 psi steam. By communicating this pocket with a counterpart poc¬ ket approaching the discharge 81, the pressure can be reduced approxi¬ mately 50% - via the coupling conduit 78. In like fashion, the coupling conduit 79 again reduces the pressure 50%, i.e.., to the order of about 40 psi by communicating a pocket 77a with a pocket 77b. In some instances, however, it may be advantageous to avoid the crossover pipe 78 and 79; instead injecting cooling water so as to reduce the pressure of the empty pockets returning to the inlet 82 of the housing 74. To further reduce the pressure in the pockets and purge the labyrinths approaching the inlet 82, I provide an ex¬ haust slot 83 (see also PIG. 7) in the end covers 84 and 85 of the housing 74. The slots 83 are seen to be relatively elongated in a radial direction and thus overlap the radially spaced recesses 86 and 87 (see PIG. 8), which in effect define labyrinthine passages in the end faces 88 and 89 of rotor 75 (see FIG. 9). In other words, the rotor 75 has a hub portion 90, equipped with the integral vanes 76 and end bells or closures 88 and 89 (see FIG. 9). The interior of each pocket 77 (still referring to FIGS. 8 and 9) is communicated with the end face of each cover 88 by means of a plurality of rec¬ tangular openings as at 91. Thus, any sawdust in the labyrinth re¬ cesses 86 and 87 at the time of passing the exhaust slot 83 is purged from the labyrinthine passages and in the case of the high pressure rotary feeder 35, returned to the low pressure pre-steamer 34 where¬ as with the low pressure rotary feeder 33, it is returned to a cy- clone section above the valve 33. However, during the portion of travel of a given pocket in approaching and leaving the discharge 81, any entrapped smaller chips, i..e, sawdust, serve to advantageously seal the rotor and casing against bypass of steam from one pocket to the next. Once the pocket 77 reaches the position over the discharge 81, steam entering the relatively elongated supply port 80 quickly purges the pockets of chips. In FIG. 5, it will be seen that the casing 74 is shaped to provide a steam jacket 92 into which high pressure steam, i-e., of the order of 3650F, is introduced so as to maintain the high pressure rotary feeder valve 35 at a substantially uniform temperature and thereby avoid the differences in expansion of the various parts. In the case of the feeder valve 35, the entering chips have a temperature of the order of 250oF, while the bottom of the feeder valve is sub¬ jected to the 365°f. Aiding in eliminating differential expansion of the various parts of the feeder valve is the provision of single pedestals as at 93 on each end of the housing 74 (see FIG. 7) , the pedestals 93 being for the purpose of supporting the end shafts 90a of the rotor 75. In order to further minimize clearances between the rotor 75 and housing 74 and thereby achieve greater efficiency in the trans¬ fer of steam-pressured wood chips, I construct the casing 74 to pro¬ vide an obround interior. This can be appreciated from a considera¬ tion of FIG. 5. The centerline designated 94 corresponds to the centerline of the lower hemicylindrical portion of the casing 74, more properly the hollow interior defined by wall 74a of the casing 74. The second centerline 95 defines the center of the upper hemi¬ cylindrical wall 74b of the housing 74. Thus, there is a relatively small straight wall section as at 74c kept in the upper and lower hemicylindrical walls so as to make up the above-mentioned "obround" configuration. The centerline 75a of the rotor 75 is about .005" to .006" below centerline 94 of the lower hemicylindrical portion of the cas¬ ing 74. The combination of the obround body, together with the rotor 75 being set .005" to .006" below the centerline 94 yields the clos¬ est possible running clearance. The steam pressure in portion 81 of FIG. 5 is so high that it actually lifts the rotor 75 to the extent of the clearances in the bearings plus slight deflections of the bearing brackets and shaft, etc. With this arrangement, I set the adjustable knives 76a on the vanes 76 so that a clearance between the knife tips and the upper hemicylindrical portion of the casing 74, at a point near the center- line is .007". This clearance is such that the tip of the blade 76a will touch the bottom hemicylindrical section at each side of outlet opening 81 when the valve is cold and at atmospheric pressure. When the valve is heated and at thorough working pressure, the rotor is lifted and the running clearance on the bottom will be approximately .008" to .010". The running clearance on the centerline will be about .007" and the running clearance at the "top will be approximate- ly .008" to .OlO"* The rotary feeder valves 33 and 35 can also be seen in FIG. 10 wherein the various mechanical drives associated with the top portion of the digester 30 are also seen. In particular, I pro¬ vide a variable speed constant torque motor 96 for driving the sub¬ mergence screw mechanism 36. This is electrically coupled to a simi¬ lar drive 97 for the pre-steamer 34 and to the drive 31a for the feed screw mechanism 31 so that as resistance builds up within the digester 30, the pre-steamer will be slowed down proportionately. Also, it will be noted that the submergence screw mechanism 36 has a diverging flight screw 98 housed within a generally conical casing 14- 99. This insures a wide dispersion of the chips within the digester which may be as big as 16 feet in diameter. The lowest flight of the submergence screw 98 is above the liquor level and this results in generally horizontally aligning the various chips discharged from the screw before the chips encounter the impregnation liquor, the horizontal alignment facilitating straining at a subsequent stage of the digestion. Other alignments are possible by changing the confi¬ guration of the bottom flight, as, for example, V-configuration of chips. Also, the screw 98 tends to compress the various chips so as to exclude air thereby facilitating the diffusion process of the im¬ pregnation liquor. As the chips leave the pre-steaming zone in which they re¬ side for only a very short time to prevent acid hydrolysis, they enter the impregnation zone, the liquor level of which is controlled by virtue of the addition of cooling liquor through the pipe 50. The circulation liquor is substantially constant in volume and the white liquor volume is determined by the requirement of the chips so the level of the impregnation liquor is advantageously adjusted through controlling the quantity of cooling liquor introduced at the bottom of the digester 30. Further, I position the discharge ends of the white liquor pipes 41 below the lowest contemplated level of the impregnation liquor, .i.e.., the level 39a. The strainers 44 and 61 are described in detail in my said prior copending Canadian patent application. Serial No. 971,134, filed September 23, 1966, to which reference may be made for a detailed description thereof. COOLING ZONE The cooling zone 47 is seen in enlarged form in FIG. 11 wherein the lower portion of the digester 30 is pictured. The plow 51 is seen to be equipped with radially inwardly extending nozzles 52 and axially positioned radially outwardly directed nozzles 53a. In addition, the two arms of the plow 51 are equipped with a plurality of depending paddles 116 which serve to move the cooled pulp toward the discharge 117 communicating with the discharge pipe 118. A motor 119 is provided along with a reducer 120 and reducer 121 for rota¬ ting the plow 51. The arrangement of opposed nozzles 52 and 53a insures that the now digested pulp is uniformly cooled and of uniform consistency across the entire cross-section of the digester and fur¬ ther, as pointed out before, the volume of cooling liquor introduced through the pipe 50 determines the liquor level at the top of the digester. To remove the digested pulp from the digester 30, a blow valve is employed such as that designated 48 in FIG. 1. The blow valve is described in detail in my prior copending application. Serial No. 971,134, filed September 23, 1966, to which reference may be made. Reference is now made to FIG. 3 which has to do with a uni¬ que arrangement for insuring uniform introduction of circulating liquor into the digester 30. In FIG. 3, it will be noted that each of the pipes 45' is telescopically received within an integral fit- ting 151 provided as part of the digester 30. Thus, this permits raising and lowering of the supply pipe 145 thereby regulating the level of the recirculation portion of the cooking zone 42. While in the foregoing specification, a detailed descrip¬ tion of an embodiment of the invention has been set down for the pur¬ pose of illustration, many variations in the details hereingiven may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. !.'l: ": The embodiments of the invention in which an exclu¬ 1.
