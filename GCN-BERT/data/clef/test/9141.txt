BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to benzenesulfonamide derivatives and a pharmaceutical composition thereof and, more particularly, to benzenesulfonamide derivatives used as a cell-cycle inhibitor for treating solid tumors and a pharmaceutical composition thereof. 2. Description of Related Art In the recent years, it is found that foods or food additives, and environmental pollutions are blamed for directly causing cancer. In addition, tobacco smoke is also a powerful carcinogen causing the deaths of millions. Hence, not only in Taiwan, but also in the developed countries around the whole world, the incidence rates of cancers are quite high. According to the data published by the American Cancer Society, cancer is perhaps the most significant threat to public health. In addition, according to the data published by Department of Health in Taiwan, cancer is the first among the 10 leading causes of death since 1982. Solid tumors of lung cancer, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer are the most common tumors causing death, and the death rate of these cancers is about 50% of all cancer deaths. Recently, anti-cancer drugs of etoposide and cisplatin have been developed, which are effective in the treatment of leukemia and lymph cancer. However, the curative effect of these drugs on lung cancer, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer is not good enough. Currently, a surgical operation can be performed to cut the cancer cell and partial lymph gland to treat the solid tumors such as gastric cancer. Also, some other treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immune therapy have been developed to treat cancers. In the recent years, the development of several therapeutic agents has lead to treatment cancers through new anti-cancer mechanisms, and it has been proved that the survival rate of patients can be increased by treating them with these therapeutic agents. These therapeutic agents can treat tumor cells through inhibiting cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, farnesyl transferase, and tyrosine kinases. Recently, the therapeutic agent for inhibiting the cell cycle progression, such as wortmannin, 5-fluorouracil, daunomycin, and colchicines are the most potential anti-cancer drugs. Eisai Co., Ltd. has investigated two kinds of benzenesulfonamide derivatives, which have already entered clinical trials. The formulas of these two benzenefulfonamide derivatives are represented as follow: These two benzenesulfonamide derivatives are inhibitors of the cell cycle, and cause cell death. E7010 shows great effect on the test for anti-cancer activity in mice, and has already entered phase II clinic trials. In addition, E7070 has the best anti-cancer activity among the benzenesulfonamide derivatives, and has already entered phase II clinic trials. It has been proved that E7070 can inhibit human colon cancer cell (colon 38), and the IC50 of E7070 is 0.26 ÂµM (Owa et.al., J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 3789-3799). However, although these benzenesulfonamide derivatives have already entered clinical trials, whether these therapeutic agents can be used in the cancer treatment is still unknown. EP0679641 discloses novel sulfonamide derivatives and novel sulfonic ester derivatives, each stated as having an excellent antitumor activity and differing in the basic skeleton from the conventional antitumor compounds. EP 1873144 discloses a glucokinase activator containing a compound represented by the formula (I): wherein each symbol is as defined in the specification, or a salt thereof or a prodrug thereof. WO2006/005063 discloses a class of novel compounds, comprising a di- substituted 9-H-carbazole, 1H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole, 5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole or 1H- pyrimido[4,5-b]indole structure, that are inhibitors of mitotic kinesins. Several therapeutic agents have been applied on the treatment of solid tumors. However, not all of them are effective due to different locations of tumor cells, different patients, and side effects generated therefrom. Because cancer is the first among the 10 leading causes of death, and solid tumors are the most common tumors causing death, it is urgent to investigate therapeutic agents for inhibiting solid tumor cells. Hence, there is a long unfulfilled need for the present invention which provides a new compound for treating solid tumors, and inhibiting the growth of the tumor cells. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide benzenesulfonamide derivatives, which can inhibit the growth of solid tumors, and exhibit great effects on treating tumor cells of gastric cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, and nasopharyngeal cancer.

[Evaluation of the pharmacological activity] Human Bladder Cancer TSGH cells, Human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells, Human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells, human nasopharyngeal carcinoma KB cells, Human gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cells, Human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells, lung carcinoma A549 cells, and Human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells were used in the preliminary cytotoxicity assays of the benzenesulfonamide derivatives of the Reference Embodiments and the present invention, and the inhibition activity against the tumor cells was evaluated. [MTT assay] All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in a humidified chamber at 37Â°C containing 5% CO2. Then, all cell lines were treated with compounds for 72 hr and subsequently incubated with 0.4 mg/mL of MTT at 37Â°C for 2 hr. The medium was removed, and DMSO was added to dissolve MTT precipitate. Cell proliferation was determined by measuring the optical density at 540 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the IC50 values of the benzenesulfonamide derivatives of the present invention were calculated. [SRB assay] All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum into 96-well microtiter plates and maintained in a humidified chamber at 37Â°C containing 5% CO2. After 24 hr, cell lines in partial wells were fixed in situ with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to represent a measurement at the time of drug addition (T0). Then, cell lines in other wells were incubated with the benzenesulfonamide derivatives of the Reference Embodiments and the present invention for an additional 48 hr, and fixed in situ with 10% TCA to represent a measurement at the time of stopping reaction (Tx). After rinsing the plates with PBS and air-drying, 0.4% sulforhodamine B solution (weight per volume in 1 % acetic acid) was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Unbound sulforhodamine B was removed with 1% acetic acid and the plates were air-dried. Cells bound with sulforhodamine B was subsequently solubilized with 10 mM Tris base (Trizma; Sigma). Cell proliferation was determined by measuring the optical density at 515 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The half-inhibition concention (GI50) of the benzenesulfonamide derivatives of the Reference Embodiments and the present invention was obtained from the detected optical density. Table 1.

For example, the IC50 values of the compound 6b against TSGH, HepaG2, HT-29, and KB cancer cells are respectively 2.1, 1.7, 1.1 and 2.5 ÂµM, and the IC50 valuesof the compound 5b are respectively 9.4, 7.9, 7.9, and >20 ÂµM. Among all the benzenesulfonamide derivatives of the Reference Embodiments and the present invention, the compound 6c with a methoxy group at the 4th position of the benzene ring has the best inhibition activity, and the IC50 values of the compound 6c against TSGH, HepaG2, HT-29, and KB cancer cells are respectively 0.5, 0.4, 0.4 and 0.8 ÂµM. However, according to the paper published by Owa et.al. (J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 3789-3799), the IC50 values of E7070 (Eisai Co., Ltd.) against KB cells, colon 38 cells, and P388 murine leukemia cells are respectively 11.4, 0.3 and 1.2 ÂµM. Hence, the compound 6c of the present invention has higher inhibitory activity agaist KB cells than E7070. In addition, the compounds 6b - 6g with substitution groups at the para-position have better inhibitory activity than the compound 6a without any substituted groups. Hence, the substitution group at the para-position can increase the inhibition activity against tumor cells. In addition, the results also show that the compounds 7a - 7c have the inhibitory activity against tumor cells, and the inhibitory activity of the compounds 7a and 7c is higher than that of the compound 5d. For example, the IC50 values of the compound 7a against TSGH, HepaG2, HT-29, and KB cancer cells are respectively 3.6, 9.1, 5.9 and 4.5 ÂµM, and the IC50 values of the compound 5d are respectively 35.6, 14, 19.8 and 20 ÂµM. Hence, the compounds 7a - 7c have the potential for the inhibition of the growth of the tumor cells. According to the results shown in Tables 1-4, the benzenesulfonamide derivatives of the present invention have the ability to inhibit the growth of the tumor cells, and the compound 6c has the highest inhibitory acitivity. In addition, the benzenesulfonamide derivatives of the present invention can cause the cell death through inhibiting cell cycle progression, so these compounds can be used for the treatment on solid tumors. Next, the inhibitory activity against tumor cells of the benzenesulfonamide derivative of the present invention is evaluated by in vitro and in vivo assays. Hereafter, the compound 6c of the present invention is called GM119. In vitro migration assay Lung carcinoma A549 cells (BCRC 60074; BCRC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in a humidified chamber at 37Â°C containing 5% CO2. All the cell lines were developed for two generations every week. In the in vitro migration assay, a scratch was mechanically made on the monolayer of cells to form a line-shaped scratch with cytological exfoliation. The scratch may lead the edge of the cell monolayer to close. When the monolayered A549 cells were saturated, a scratch was made using a 200-ÂµL tip directly on the monolayer of the A549 cells. Cells were then treated with GM119 with a concentration of 0, 0.5, or 10 ÂµM. After incubation for 18 hr, all the migrations were tracked with a microscope. The images showed that the inhibition on the migration of the A549 cells was greater as the concentration of the GM119 was increased. In addition, 25 Âµg of cell extraction of the A549 treated with GM 119 with different concentration was observed by western blotting. Sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and visualized with the antibodies of anti-p53, anti-p-p53, and anti-actin. In vitro tube formation assay for evaluating the capillary formation At day 1, HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) cocultured with human fibroblasts were incubated in optimized medium and maintained in a humidified chamber at 37Â°C containing 5% CO2. After 1 day, recombinant human VEGF (25 ng/mL) was added to the medium as a positive control, and VEGF (25 ng/mL) combined with suramin (2 M) was used as a negative control. The cells were stimulated with VEGF (25 ng/mL) without or with GM119 (0.1, 1 or 10 ÂµM). The media were replaced at days 3, 6, and 8. At day 11, the tube-like structures of the umbilical vein endothelial cells were observed by an anti-human CD31 antibody (Kurabo, Tokyo, Japan), and the area of the tube-like structures was analyzed. After the analysis of the phase-contrast microscope, it can be found that GM119 can inhibit the formation of the tube-like structures of the umbilical vein endothelial cells induced by VEGF. In addition, compared with the inhibition results of 10 ÂµM GM119 with 10 ÂµM suramin, it can be found that the inhibition activity of GM119 is almost equivalent to that of suramin. Evaluation of the effect of the benzenesulfonamide derivative in the murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 model with chemiluminescence imaging The murine mammary carcinoma cell line 4T1-Luc cells stably expressing the firefly luciferase gene under the selection of G418 was cultured in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were maintained at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 in air and subcultured twice weekly. Each well of 96-well plates was seeded with 2,500 or 5,000 tumor cells, and the tumor cells were incubated in medum with 10% fetal bovine serum or without serum. The tumor cells were treated with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 ÂµM of GM 119 for 48 hr. Then, the tumor cells were fixed with 10% of trichloroacetic acid, washed with water, stained with sulforhodamine B. Then, the sample was washed with 1% of acetic acid, and Tris buffer was added into the sample. The absorption of the sample was determined at 515 nm with a Thermomax microplate reader, and repeated for 4 times. The absorption of the cells without drug treatment served as 100% survival, and the survival was calculated and represented by average Â± standard deviation %. As shown in FIG. 1, in the medium with or without serum, the growth of the 4T1 cells can be inhibited by use of 0.01 ÂµM of GM119. In addition, when the concentration of GM 119 is 10 ÂµM, the inhibition of the 4T1 cells is apparent. In vitro analysis on cell morphology After the 4T1-Luc cells were treated with GM119, a phase-contrast microscope was used to observe the cell morphology of the 4T1-Luc cells. Cover glasses were placed in 6-well plates, and each well was seeded with 50,000 tumor cells. The tumor cells were developed in medum with 10% fetal bovine serum, and then treated with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 ÂµM of GM119 for 48 hr. The cells were stained with Giemsa Stain solution (0.38 g of Giemsa powder, 15% of methanol, and 5% of glycerol). After the cells were washed, dried, and sealed, the images of the cells were photographed with a phase-contrast microscope. From the images obtained under microscope analysis, the growth of the 4T1 cells can be inhibited by use of 0.01 ÂµM of GM 119. In addition, when the concentration of GM 119 is 10 ÂµM, the inhibition of the 4T1 cells is apparent. Western blot analysis After the 4T1-Luc cells were treated with GM119 (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 ÂµM) for 36 hr, the cells were collected with a centrifuge. Then, the collected cells were disrupted on ice with ultra-sonication for 15 sec. After centrifugation, the upper layer of the cell lysate was collected to obtain a cell extract. The protein concentration was analyzed with a Bradford dye-binding method (BioRad, U.S.A). 25 Âµg of the cell extract was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and visualized with the antibodies of anti-p53, anti-p-p53, and anti-actin. In vivo evaluation of GM119 GM119 (25 mg/kg) was applied to a mouse implanted with 4T1-Luc cells for a short time, and then Taxol (10 mg/kg) was applied thereto to observe the effect of GM119 on the 4T1-Luc cells. A suspension of 4T1-Luc cells in matrigel was injected into the breast adipocyte to obtain mice implanted with luciferase tumor cells. The size of the tumor cells was observed with a Night OWL optic every day before applying GM 119. When the size of the tumor cells was achieved to 200-500 mm3, the mice were divided into 2 groups, and the number of the mice in each group is â§ 5. Then, 0 or 25 mg/kg of GM119 was abdominal-injected into the mice for 5 days, wherein GM119 was dissolved in cremophor, and the volumn of injection to each mouse is 50 Âµl. Then, 0 or 10 mg/kg of Taxol was abdominal-injected into the mice for every 2 days until death of the mice. The weight and the number of the mice were recorded every day to analyze the change on the weight and the survival time of the mice. After the drugs were applied to the mice, the size of the tumor cells in the mice was evaluated with bioluminescence every two days. FIG. 2 is the result showing the survival time of mice treated with drugs for a short time. As shown in FIG. 2, the survival of the mice can be greatly increased by use of GM119 alone or combined with Taxol, as the same result by use of Taxol alone. In addition, the results of bioluminescence show that the growth of the tumor cells can be inhibited by use of GM119, Taxol, or a combination thereof. GM119 (25 mg/kg) and Taxol (10 mg/kg) were simultaneously applied to a mouse implanted with 4T1-Luc cells for a long time to observe the effect of GM119 on the 4T1-Luc cells. A suspension of 4T1-Luc cells in matrigel was injected into the breast adipocyte to obtain mice implanted with luciferase tumor cells. The size of the tumor cells was observed with a Night OWL optic every day before applying GM119. When the size of the tumor cells was achieved to 200-500 mm3, the mice were divided into 2 groups, and the number of the mice in each group is â§ 5. Then, 0/0, 0/25, 10/23, or 10/0 mg/kg of Taxol/GM119 was abdominal-injected into the mice every two days until death of the mice, wherein GM119 and Taxol were dissolved in cremophor, and the volumn of injection to each mouse is 50 Âµl. The weight and the number of the mice were recorded every day to analyze the change on the weight and the survival time of the mice. After the drugs were applied to the mice, the size of the tumor cells in the mice was evaluated with bioluminescence every two days. FIG. 3 is the result showing the survival time of mice treated with drugs for a long time. As shown in FIG. 3, the survival of the mice can be increased when Taxol was applied for a long time, but the survival can be further increased when Taxol and GM119 were applied at the same time. In addition, when GM119 alone was applied for a long time, the survival time of the mice is the longest. Furthermore, the results of bioluminescence show that the growth of the tumor cells can be inhibited by use of GM119, Taxol, or a combination thereof.
