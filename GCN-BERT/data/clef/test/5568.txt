BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to processes and systems for synthesizing alkyl bromides into high molecular weight hydrocarbons in at least two sequential or concurrent stages, and more particularly, in one or more embodiments, to processes and systems for synthesizing alkyl bromides in at least two sequential or concurrent stages operated with different feeds and at different temperatures. 2. Description of Related Art Mono-brominated alkanes may be used in the production of high molecular weight hydrocarbons, such as C5+ gasoline-range and heavier hydrocarbons, as well as olefins, for example by conversion over an appropriate catalyst, such as a synthetic crystalline alumino-silicate catalyst, at sufficient temperatures to form high molecular-weight C3+ hydrocarbons, the C6+ fraction of which are predominately substituted aromatics. As the aromatic content of the C6+ fraction of the high molecular weight hydrocarbons derived from such a process is higher than desired for production of “neat” gasoline motor fuel, the C6+ fraction is valuable as a high-octane blending component with a petroleum-derived naphtha or natural gasoline derived from the processing of natural gas to produce a motor fuel. Petroleum-derived naphtha or natural gasoline derived from the processing of natural gas typically contain substantial paraffin content and have low octane ratings. Thus, a need exists for a process of synthesizing mono-brominated alkanes over a suitable catalyst and at a suitable temperature to produce higher molecular-weight C3+ hydrocarbons, the C6+ fraction of which contains a substantial C6+ paraffin content and thus a reduced aromatic content. Poly-brominated alkanes, particularly di-brominated methane, tri-brominated methane, and mixtures thereof, are often formed during the bromination of lower molecular weight alkanes along with the preferred mono-brominated alkanes. The presence of these poly-brominated alkanes significantly increases the rate of coke formation during the conversion alkyl bromides over an appropriate catalyst as mentioned above. Such coke formation more rapidly deactivates the catalyst leading to short cycle times between regenerations and reducing the carbon efficiency of the process. Thus, a further need exists to significantly reduce the coke formation attributed to poly-brominated alkanes during the synthesis of mono-brominated alkanes and to increase the yield of higher molecular-weight C3+ hydrocarbons SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION To achieve the foregoing and other objects, and in accordance with the purposes of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, one characterization of the present invention is a process which comprises providing alkyl bromides and reacting at least a first portion of the alkyl bromides in the presence of a first catalyst and at a first temperature sufficient to form a first hydrocarbon product containing at least hydrocarbons having at least 5 carbon atoms and having a substantial C6+ paraffin content. A second portion of the alkyl bromides is reacted in the presence of a second catalyst and at a second temperature sufficient to form a second hydrocarbon product containing at least hydrocarbons having at least 5 carbon atoms and having a substantial substituted aromatic content. In another characterization of the present invention, a process comprises providing a first feed gas stream containing lower molecular weight alkanes and having less than about 4.0 mol % C2+ components and reacting bromine with the first feed gas stream to form first alkyl bromides. At least the first alkyl bromides may be reacted in the presence of a first catalyst and at a first temperature sufficient to form a first hydrocarbon product containing at least hydrocarbons having at least 5 carbon atoms and having a substantial C6+ paraffin content. A second feed gas stream containing lower molecular weight alkanes and having predominately C2+ components is reacted with bromine to form second alkyl bromides. At least the second alkyl bromides are reacted in the presence of a second catalyst and at a second temperature sufficient to form a second hydrocarbon product containing at least hydrocarbons having at least 5 carbon atoms and having a substantial substituted aromatic content. In still another characterization of the present invention, a system is provided having a first synthesis zone and a second synthesis zone. The first synthesis zone contains a suitable catalyst and is configured to form at a first temperature hydrocarbon products containing paraffins from synthesis reactants comprising alkyl bromides. The second synthesis zone is in fluid communication with the first synthesis zone, contains a second suitable catalyst and is configured to form at a second temperature hydrocarbon products containing substituted aromatics from synthesis reactants comprising a unreacted portion of the alkyl bromides. In a still further characterization of the present invention, a system is provided having a first bromination reactor, a first synthesis reactor, a second bromination reactor and a second synthesis reactor. The first bromination reactor is configured to form first bromination products comprising alkyl bromides from first bromination reactants comprising lower molecular weight alkanes having less than about 4.0 mol % C2+ components. The first synthesis reactor is in fluid communication with the first bromination reactor, contains a suitable catalyst and is configured to form hydrocarbon products containing paraffins from the first bromination products. The second bromination reactor is configured to form second bromination products comprising alkyl bromides from second bromination reactants comprising lower molecular weight alkanes containing predominately C2+ components. The second synthesis reactor is in fluid communication with the second bromination reactor, contains a suitable catalyst and is configured to form hydrocarbon products containing substituted aromatics from the first bromination products. The second synthesis reactor is operated at a higher temperature than the first bromination reactor.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As used herein, the term “alkyl bromides” refers to mono-, di-, and tri-brominated lower molecular weight alkanes, and combinations of these. The term “high molecular weight hydrocarbons” as used herein refers to hydrocarbons comprising C3 chains and longer hydrocarbon chains. In some embodiments, the high molecular weight hydrocarbons may be used directly as a product (e.g., LPG, motor fuel, etc.). In other instances, the high molecular weight hydrocarbons may be used as an intermediate product or as a feedstock for further processing. In other instances, the high molecular weight hydrocarbons may be further processed, for example, to produce gasoline grade fuels, diesel grade fuels, and fuel additives. In some embodiments, the high molecular weight hydrocarbons obtained by the processes of the present invention can be used directly as a motor gasoline fuel having a substantial paraffin content, as a fuel blending stock, or as feedstock for further processing, such as an aromatic feed to a process producing aromatic polymers such as polystyrene or related polymers, or an olefin feed to a process for producing polyolefins. The term “olefins” as used herein refers to hydrocarbons that contain two to six carbon atoms and at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The olefins may be further processed if desired. In some instances, the olefins produced by the processes of the present invention may be further reacted in a polymerization reaction (for example, a reaction using a metallocene catalyst) to produce poly(olefins), which may be useful in many end products such as plastics or synthetic lubricants. The end use of the high molecular weight hydrocarbons, the olefins or mixtures thereof may depend on the particular catalyst employed in the synthesis portion of the processes and systems discussed below, as well as the operating parameters employed in the process. Other uses will be evident to those skilled in the art with the benefit of this disclosure. Lower molecular weight alkanes may be used as a feed stock for the methods described herein. As utilized throughout this description, the term “lower molecular weight alkanes” refers to methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane or mixtures of two or more of these individual alkanes. The lower molecular weight alkanes may be from any suitable source, for example, any source of gas that provides lower molecular weight alkanes, whether naturally occurring or synthetically produced. Examples of sources of lower molecular weight alkanes for use in the processes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, natural gas, coal-bed methane, regasified liquefied natural gas, gas derived from gas hydrates and/or chlathrates, gas derived from aerobic and/or anaerobic decomposition of organic matter or biomass, gas derived in the processing of tar sands, and synthetically produced natural gas or alkanes. Combinations of these may be suitable as well in some embodiments. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to treat the feed gas to remove undesirable compounds, such as sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide. In any event, it is important to note that small amounts of carbon dioxide, e.g., less than about 2 mol %, can be tolerated in the feed gas to the processes of the present invention. Suitable sources of bromine that may be used in various embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to, elemental bromine, bromine salts, aqueous hydrobromic acid, metal bromide salts, and the like. Combinations may be suitable, but as recognized by those skilled in the art, using multiple sources may present additional complications. Certain embodiments of the methods and systems of the invention are described below. Although major aspects of what is to believed to be the primary chemical reactions involved in the methods are discussed in detail as it is believed that they occur, it should be understood that side reactions may take place. One should not assume that the failure to discuss any particular side reaction herein means that that reaction does not occur. Conversely, those that are discussed should not be considered exhaustive or limiting. Additionally, although figures are provided that schematically show certain aspects of the methods of the present invention, these figures should not be viewed as' limiting on any particular method of the invention. A block flow diagram generally depicting some aspects of certain embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 1. Alkyl bromides which are used as a feed in the embodiments depicted in FIG. 1 may be formed from brominating a feed gas stream containing lower molecular weight alkanes which is primarily methane with acceptable concentrations of C2+ lower molecular weight alkane components. Such bromination may proceed thermally, catalytically or by a combination thereof. Typically, hydrogen bromide may also be formed in the bromination of lower molecular weight alkanes. In accordance with the embodiments of the processes of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 1, a gas stream 2 containing alkyl bromides may be cooled or heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 3, to about 150° C. to about 300° C., and more preferably from about 225° C. to about 275° C., before being introduced into to a first stage synthesis reactor 4. In the first stage synthesis reactor, the alkyl bromides are reacted exothermically at a temperature range of from about 150° C. to about 300° C., and more preferably from about 225° C. to about 275° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst 5 to produce desired products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these conditions propyl bromide is more reactive than methyl bromide or ethyl bromide over a suitable catalyst thereby preferentially synthesizing the propyl units to form hydrocarbon products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain a substantial C6+ paraffin content and thus a reduced aromatic content. In the first stage synthesis reactor 4, only a portion of the mono-brominated alkanes present in the alkyl bromides is converted, and any poly-brominated alkanes which may be present may have a lower propensity to be converted to heavy products or “coke” which deposit on the catalyst, due to the presence of propyl bromide and the lower temperature conditions. The effluent 6 from the first stage synthesis reactor may be heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 7, before being introduced into a second stage synthesis reactor 8. In the second stage synthesis reactor, the methyl and ethyl bromides that are contained in the effluent are reacted exothermically at a temperature in the range of about 300° C. to about 450° C., and more preferably in the range of about 350° C. to about 425° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst 9 to produce desired hydrocarbon products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof) which are removed as a hydrocarbon product stream 10 from second stage synthesis reactor 8. It is thought that at these conditions the methyl bromides and ethyl bromides may preferentially react over a suitable catalyst to oligomerize the methyl and ethyl units thereby forming products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain C6+ fractions having primarily substituted aromatics and also light alkanes primarily in the C3 to C5+ range. The catalyst used in the first and second stage synthesis reactors 4 and 8, respectively, may be any of a variety of suitable materials for catalyzing the conversion of the alkyl bromides to product hydrocarbons. In certain embodiments, the first and second stage synthesis reactors may comprise a fixed bed of the catalyst. A fluidized-bed of synthesis catalyst may also be used in certain circumstances, particularly in larger applications and may have certain advantages, such as constant removal of coke and a steady selectivity to product composition. Examples of suitable catalysts include a fairly wide range of materials that have the common functionality of being acidic ion-exchangers and which also contain a synthetic crystalline alumino-silicate oxide framework. In certain embodiments, a portion of the aluminum in the crystalline alumino-silicate oxide framework may be substituted with magnesium, boron, gallium and/or titanium. In certain embodiments, a portion of the silicon in the crystalline alumino-silicate oxide framework may be optionally substituted with phosphorus. The crystalline alumino-silicate catalyst generally may have a significant anionic charge within the crystalline alumino-silicate oxide framework structure which may be balanced, for example, by Na cations. Although zeolitic catalysts may be commonly obtained in a sodium form, a protonic or hydrogen form (via ion-exchange with ammonium hydroxide, and subsequent calcining) is preferred, or a mixed protonic/sodium form may also be used. The zeolite may also be modified by ion exchange with cations of other elements. Elements useful for ion exchange of the zeolite include 1st-row transition metals, Group 1 (IA), Group 2 (IIA), La, Ce, Mo, V, Ag or combinations thereof. Such subsequent ion-exchange, may replace the charge-balancing counter-ions, but furthermore may also partially replace ions in the oxide framework resulting in a modification of the crystalline make-up and structure of the oxide framework. The crystalline alumino-silicate or substituted crystalline alumino-silicate may include a microporous or mesoporous crystalline aluminosilicate, but, in certain embodiments, may include a synthetic microporous crystalline zeolite, and, for example, being of the MFI structure such as ZSM-5. Moreover, the crystalline alumino-silicate or substituted crystalline alumino-silicate, in certain embodiments, may be subsequently impregnated with an aqueous solution of a Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, V, Ag, La or Ce salt, such as Ce(NO3)3, dried and calcined in air. In certain embodiments, the salts may be a halide salt, such as a bromide salt, such as MgBr2. Optionally, the crystalline alumino-silicate or substituted crystalline alumino-silicate may also contain between about 0.1 to about 1 weight % Pt, about 0.1 to 5 weight % Pd, or about 0.1 to about 5 weight % Ni in the metallic state. Although, such zeolite materials are primarily initially crystalline, it should be noted that some crystalline catalysts may undergo some loss of crystallinity either due to initial ion-exchange or impregnation or due to operation at the reaction conditions or during regeneration and hence my also contain significant amorphous character, yet still retain significant, and in some cases improved activity. The particular catalyst 5 and 9 used in both the first and second stage synthesis reactors 4 and 8, respectively, will depend, for example, upon the particular product hydrocarbons that are desired. For example, when product hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions are desired, a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst may be used. When it is desired to produce product hydrocarbons comprising a mixture of olefins and C6+ products, an X-type or Y-type zeolite catalyst or SAPO zeolite catalyst may be used. Examples of suitable zeolites include an X-type, such as 10-X, or Y-type zeolite, although other zeolites with differing pore sizes and acidities, may be used in embodiments of the present invention. The catalyst used in the first and second stage synthesis reactors need not be identical so long as the catalyst used in both reactors are selected to form the similar products, e.g. selected to form hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions. In addition to the catalyst, the temperature at which the first and second stage synthesis reactors are operated is an important parameter in determining the selectivity and conversion of the reaction to the particular product desired. For example, when a X type or Y type zeolite catalyst is used and it is desired to produce olefins, it may be advisable to operate the first stage synthesis reactor at a temperature within the range of about 250° C. to 400° C. and the second stage synthesis reactor at a temperature within the range of about 400° C. to 450° C. Alternatively, in an embodiment involving a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst operating in a slightly lower temperature range of about 150° C. to 300° C. in the first stage synthesis reactor and about 300° C. to 400° C. in the second stage synthesis reactor, will result in the production of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. In both instances, the high molecular weight hydrocarbon products produced by process and system of the present invention as illustrated in FIG. 1 will contain a substantial C6+ paraffin content. A block flow diagram generally depicting some aspects of certain embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 2 and are similar to that illustrated in FIG. 1 and described above except that the first stage synthesis and the second stage synthesis are contained within distinct zones or beds 14 and 18, respectively, within the same reactor or vessel 11 containing suitable catalyst 15 and 19. Each zone or bed may be fixed or fluidized and the reactor may be provided with a suitable means for heating the effluent from the first stage synthesis zone or bed, such as an internal or external heat exchanger, prior to introducing the same to the second stage synthesis zone or bed within the same reactor. An internal exchanger 16 may be positioned between the first stage and the second stage synthesis zone or bed 14 and 18, respectively, as illustrated in FIG. 2. Where an external heater configuration is employed, an internal baffle may, for example, separate the two catalyst beds or zones contained within one reactor. Vapor effluent emanating from the first stage synthesis zone or bed located upstream of the internal baffle may be withdrawn via a suitable port or nozzle and heated in an external heat exchanger. The heated vapor may then be introduced to the reactor via a suitable port or nozzle below the internal baffle but above the second stage synthesis zone or bed. By combining the synthesis stages that are conducted in sequence into one reactor 11, equipment and operating costs are reduced. A block flow diagram generally depicting some aspects of certain embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 3. A feed gas stream 20 containing lower molecular weight alkanes may be pretreated to remove C2+ components prior to being combined with bromine vapor and conveyed to a bromination reactor. The concentration of C2+ components in the feed gas stream introduced into the bromination reactor 24 may less than about 4.0 mol %, more preferably less than about 2.0 mol %, and most preferably less than about 0.5 mol %. While some C2+ hydrocarbons may be tolerated in the bromination reactor in the embodiment of FIG. 3, higher concentrations thereof may result in the rapid formation of carbon-containing coke-like solids which may cause significant fouling and plugging in the bromination reactor as well as downstream components. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the feed gas stream may be combined with the effluent from the second stage synthesis reactor 36, product hydrocarbons and residual hydrocarbons, and pretreated in a product separation stage 40 to selectively remove C2+ components and product hydrocarbons. More specifically, the feed gas, residual hydrocarbons and product hydrocarbons, e.g. high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, may be conveyed to the product separation stage 40. The high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof as well as some C2+ components may be then separated from the feed gas and process recycle gas to form a C4+ liquid product stream 21. The feed gas and recycle gas are further processed to form a feed stream 22 for bromination reactor 24 and a gas stream 23 which is predominately C3+ lower molecular weight alkane components with excess C2 that is not able to be included in feed stream 22 due to C2+ concentration limitations. The feed stream 22 which is primarily methane with acceptable concentrations of C2+ lower molecular alkane components as noted above may be combined with bromine via stream 48 prior to, upon introduction into or within a bromination reactor. Gas stream 23 may be used in conjunction with a shift reactor 26 in a manner as hereinafter described, while the liquid hydrocarbon product 21 may be removed from the product separation stage for use or further petrochemical or fuel processing. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the feed stream 22 containing predominantly methane and acceptable amounts of C2+ lower molecular weight alkane components may be reacted exothermically in the bromination reactor with dry bromine vapor at a relatively low temperature in the range of about 250° C. to about 600° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 bar to about 30 bar to produce gaseous alkyl bromides and hydrogen bromide vapors. As will be evident to a skilled artisan with the benefit of this disclosure, the bromination reaction in bromination reactor 24 may be a homogeneous (thermal) reaction or a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. Nonlimiting examples of suitable catalysts that may be used in first reactor 30 include platinum, palladium, or supported non-stiochiometric metal oxy-halides, such as FeOxBry or FeOxCly or supported metal oxy-halides, such as TaOF3, NbOF3, ZrOF2, SbOF3 as described in Olah, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 7097-7105. The upper limit of the operating temperature range is greater than the upper limit of the reaction initiation temperature range to which the feed mixture is heated due to the exothermic nature of the bromination reaction. In the case of methane, the formation of methyl bromide is believed to occur in accordance with the following general reaction: [in-line-formulae]CH4(g)+Br2(g)→CH3Br(g)+HBr(g)[/in-line-formulae] Due to the free-radical mechanism of the gas-phase bromination reaction, di-bromomethane and some tri-bromomethane and other poly-brominated lower molecular weight alkanes may be also formed. Bromination often occurs in the bromination reactor with a relatively high degree of selectivity to methyl bromide due to the alkane to bromine ratio employed. For example, in the case of the bromination of methane, a methane to bromine ratio of about 6:1 is believed to increase the selectivity to mono-halogenated methyl bromide to average approximately 88%, depending on reaction conditions, such as residence times less than about 15 seconds, temperature less than about 450° C., and extent of turbulent mixing. At these conditions, some dibromomethane and only extremely small amounts of tribromomethane approaching the detectable limits may also be formed in the bromination reaction. If a lower methane to bromine, ratio of approximately 3 to 1 is utilized, selectivity to the mono-halogenated methyl bromide may fall to the range of approximately 65 to 75% at residence times less than about 15 seconds and temperatures less than about 450° C. However, methyl bromide selectivity may rise to approximately 90% if temperatures are increased to the range of about 490° C. to 530° C. and residence time is increased to about 60 seconds. However, at a methane to bromine ratio significantly less than about 2.5 to 1, unacceptably low selectivities to methyl bromide occurs, and, moreover, significant formation of undesirable di-bromomethane, tri-bromomethane, and carbon soot is observed. The relatively higher temperature range of about 450° C. to 530° C. employed in the bromination reactor also ensures that bromine is substantially consumed in the bromination reactor thereby effectively inhibiting subsequent formation of free-radical bromination in subsequent stages of the processes of the present invention due to the presence of elemental bromine. The residence time of the reactants in the bromination reactor necessary to achieve near-complete bromine reaction is relatively short and may be as little as 1-5 seconds under adiabatic reaction conditions. Any higher molecular weight alkanes, such as ethane, propane and butane that are contained in the feed gas to the bromination reactor may also be brominated, resulting in mono- and multiple-brominated species such as ethyl bromides, propyl bromides and butyl bromides. Further, in some embodiments, the dry bromine vapor that is fed into the bromination reactor may be substantially water-free. Applicant has discovered that, at least in some instances, this may be preferred because it appears that elimination of substantially all water vapor from the bromination step substantially eliminates the formation of unwanted carbon dioxide. This may increase the selectivity of alkane bromination to alkyl bromides, thus possibly eliminating the large amount of waste heat generated in the formation of carbon dioxide from alkanes. Gas stream 23 may be combined with the effluent 25 withdrawn from the bromination reactor that comprises alkyl bromides, hydrogen bromide and unreacted bromine and introduced into a shift/reproportionation reactor 26. Further, although the bromine is generally rapidly reacted, any small amount of unreacted bromine which is not reacted in the bromination reactor due to imperfect mixing or shorter residence times and which may be present in the effluent from the bromination reactor is readily consumed by thermal bromination reaction with C2+ hydrocarbons prior to or upon introduction into a shift/reproportionation reactor. In the shift/reproportionation reactor 26, a significant portion of the di- and tri-brominated alkanes that may be present in the alkyl bromides contained in the effluent 25 from the bromination reactor may be selectively converted upon reaction with C2+ components to mono-brominated alkanes. As an example, where C3 and di-bromomethane are the reactants, it is believed that the conversion occurs in accordance with the following general reaction: [in-line-formulae]C3H8+CH2Br2→CH3Br+C3H7Br[/in-line-formulae] Although this reaction may proceed thermally without a catalyst, it has been determined that such thermal reaction requires unacceptably long residence time within the shift/reproportionation reactor and does not achieve satisfactory conversion rates to mono-brominated alkanes. Accordingly, it is preferred that the shift/reproportionation reactor contain a bed of suitable catalyst (not illustrated) selected from Group VIII metals, Group VIB metals, Group IB metals, aluminum, zinc, vanadium, magnesium, calcium, titanium, and mixtures thereof. Group VIII metals include iron, cobalt, nickel, platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, osmium or mixtures of two or more thereof. Group VIB metals include tungsten, molybdenum or chromium. Group IB metals include copper or silver. Preferably, the Group VIII metal used in this embodiment of the present invention is a noble metal selected from platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, osmium, or mixtures of two or more thereof, and more preferably the Group VIII metal is platinum. Most preferably, the Group VIII metal is iron employed as a metal bromide, metal oxide or non-stoichometric metal oxy-bromide. Preferably the Group VIB metals are molybdenum or tungsten. Preferably the Group IB metal is copper employed as a metal bromide, metal oxide or metal oxy-bromide. Nonlimiting examples of suitable metal catalysts listed above which may form more than one thermally reversible bromide salt as used in the processes of the present invention are iron, molybdenum, tungsten, copper, vanadium, chromium or mixtures of two or more thereof. Nonlimiting examples of suitable catalysts listed above which may form single bromide salts as used in the processes of the present invention are cobalt, nickel, silver, zinc, magnesium, calcium, titanium, aluminum or mixtures of two or more thereof. These metals which form more than one thermally reversible bromide salt or a single bromide salt may be initially employed in the processes of the present invention as a bromide salt or an oxide since they would exist and function as bromides in the shift/reproportionation reactor due to conversion to bromide salts via a reaction with hydrogen bromide under the conditions employed in the shift/reproportionation reactor. Suitable supports are selected to have relatively low acidity to inhibit thermal decomposition and cracking of poly-brominated alkanes and have relatively low surface area to inhibit adsorption of the poly-brominated alkanes onto the support. Nonlimiting examples of suitable supports for use with the catalyst in the shift/reproportionation reactor are silica, titania, zirconia or low surface area alumina, preferably having a specific surface area less than about 50 m2/g. The catalyst is loaded and dispersed upon a suitable support to yield high activity in a cost effective manner as will be evident to a skilled artisan. For example, it is preferred to use a loading of from about 0.1 wt % to about 1 wt % and more preferably from about 0.3 wt % to about 0.5 wt % when platinum is employed as the catalyst in the shift/reproportionation reactor bed, while a loading of from about 1 wt % to about 10 wt % and more preferably 3 wt % to about 10 wt % is employed when palladium is employed as the catalyst. In the case of the preferred non-noble metals such as iron, molybdenum, vanadium or mixtures thereof with higher loadings in the range of about 10% to about 20% or greater (as metal oxide) are cost-effective. When using a catalyst in the shift/reproportionation reactor 26, it is preferred to operate the reactor 26 at from about 200° C. to about 500° C., more preferably from about 300° C. to about 400° C. The residence time of the reactants in the shift/reproportionation reactor 26 necessary to achieve the desired selectivity to mono-brominated alkanes is relatively short and may be as little as 2 to 8 seconds. The effluent 27 from shift/reproportionation reactor which contains alkyl bromides having a significantly increased ratio of mono-brominated alkanes to di- or tri-brominated alkanes may be cooled or heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 28, to about 150° C. to about 300° C., more preferably from about 225° C. to about 275° C., before being introduced into a first stage synthesis reactor 32. In the first stage synthesis reactor 32, the alkyl bromides may be reacted exothermically at a temperature range of from about 150° C. to about 300° C., and more preferably from about 225° C. to about 275° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst 33 to produce desired hydrocarbons products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these conditions propyl bromide is more reactive than methyl bromide or ethyl bromide over a suitable catalyst thereby preferentially oligomerizing the propyl units thereby forming hydrocarbon products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain a substantial C6+ paraffin content and thus a reduced aromatic content. In the first stage synthesis reactor 32, only a portion of the mono-brominated alkanes present in the alkyl bromides may be converted, and any poly-brominated alkanes which may be present may have a lower propensity to be converted to heavy products or “coke” which deposit on the catalyst, due to the presence of propyl bromide and the lower temperature conditions. The effluent 34 from the first stage synthesis reactor may be heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 35, before being introduced into a second stage synthesis reactor 36. Effluent 34 contains hydrocarbon products and unreacted alkyl methyl and ethyl bromides. In the second stage synthesis reactor 36, the methyl and ethyl bromides may be reacted exothermically at a temperature in the range of about 300° C. to about 450° C., and more preferably in the range of about 350° C. to about 425° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst to produce desired hydrocarbon products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these conditions the methyl bromides and ethyl bromides are reactive over a suitable catalyst to preferentially oligomerize the methyl and ethyl units thereby forming hydrocarbon products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain C7+ fractions having primarily substituted aromatics and also light alkanes primarily in the C3 to C5+ range. The catalyst 33 and 37 employed in the first and second stage synthesis reactors 32 and 36, respectively, may be any of a variety of suitable materials for catalyzing the conversion of the alkyl bromides to product hydrocarbons as previously set forth. In certain embodiments, the first and second stage synthesis reactors may comprise a fixed bed of the catalyst. A fluidized-bed of synthesis catalyst may also be used in certain circumstances, particularly in larger applications and may have certain advantages, such as constant removal of coke and a steady selectivity to product composition. The particular catalyst used in both the first and second stage synthesis reactors 32 and 36 will depend, for example, upon the particular product hydrocarbons that are desired. For example, when product hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions are desired, a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst may be used. When it is desired to produce product hydrocarbons comprising a mixture of olefins and C5+ products, an X-type or Y-type zeolite catalyst or SAPO zeolite catalyst may be used. Examples of suitable zeolites include an X-type, such as 10-X, or Y-type zeolite, although other zeolites with differing pore sizes and acidities, may be used in embodiments of the present invention. The catalyst used in the first and second stage synthesis reactors 32 and 36 need not be identical so long as the catalyst used in both reactors are selected to form the similar products, e.g. selected to form hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions. The effluent 38 from the second stage synthesis reactor 36 may be cooled by suitable means such as heat exchanger 39 to recover heat for use elsewhere in the process, such as to produce steam or preheat feed to the process (not shown) or for other uses as determined by the skilled artisan, and then conveyed to a product separation stage 40. Hydrogen bromide may be removed from the hydrocarbon product, e.g. high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, in the product separation stage and a stream 42 of separated hydrogen bromide may be conveyed to a bromide oxidation stage 44 wherein hydrogen bromide may be neutralized by a partially oxidized metal bromide salt to yield a metal bromide salt and steam. A stream 46 of oxygen or air may be introduced to the bromide oxidation stage 44 of the present invention to contact the resultant metal bromide salt so as to yield elemental bromine. A stream 48 of bromine may be recycled to the bromination stage as a dry bromine vapor and a partially oxidized metal bromide salt which may be used to neutralize and remove additional hydrogen bromide from the hydrocarbons produced by the process. The steam resulting from oxidation of the HBr with the partially oxidized metal bromide salt may be condensed, stripped of any residual bromine and withdrawn as a byproduct liquid water stream 49. The first stage synthesis reactor 32 and the second stage synthesis reactor 36 of the process embodiments illustrated in FIG. 3 may be contained within distinct zones or beds within the same reactor as depicted in FIG. 2 and described above. Each zone or bed may be fixed or fluidized and the reactor may be provided with a suitable means for heating the effluent from the first stage synthesis zone or bed, such as an internal or external heat exchanger, prior to flowing the same to the second stage synthesis zone or bed within the same reactor. A block flow diagram generally depicting some aspects of certain embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 4. While each of the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 1-3 and discussed above employed first stage synthesis and the second stage synthesis reactors, zones or beds arranged in a series configuration, the embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention illustrated generally in FIG. 4 depict a first synthesis reactor (low temperature) and a second synthesis (high temperature) reactor arranged in parallel. In such a parallel configuration, a stream 55 of C1+ alkyl bromides which are used as a feed to the second synthesis reactor in the embodiments depicted in FIG. 4 may be formed from brominating a feed gas stream containing lower molecular weight alkanes which is primarily methane with acceptable concentrations of C2+ lower molecular alkane components. As discussed above with respect to FIGS. 1-3, the feed gas stream containing lower molecular weight alkanes may be pretreated to remove C2+ components prior to being combined with bromine vapor and conveyed to a bromination reactor. The concentration of C2+ components in the feed gas stream introduction into the bromination reactor may be less than about 4.0 mol %, more preferably less than about 2.0 mol %, and most preferably less than about 0.5 mol %. While some C2+ hydrocarbons may be tolerated in the bromination reactor in the embodiment of FIG. 3, higher concentrations thereof may result in the rapid formation of carbon-containing coke-like solids which cause fouling and plugging in the bromination reactor as well as downstream components. The steam 55 of C1+ alkyl bromides are heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 56, before being introduced into a second synthesis reactor 57. In the second synthesis reactor 57, the methyl and ethyl bromides are reacted exothermically at a temperature in the range of about 300° C. to about 450° C., more preferably in the range of about 350° C. to about 425° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst 58 to produce desired hydrocarbon products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these conditions the methyl bromides and ethyl bromides are reactive over a suitable catalyst 58 to oligomerize the methyl and ethyl units thereby forming a stream 59 of hydrocarbon products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain C6+ fractions having primarily substituted aromatics and also light alkanes primarily in the C3 to C5+ range. A separate stream 50 of predominately C3+ alkyl bromides which are used as a feed to the first synthesis reactor 52 in the embodiments depicted in FIG. 4 may be formed from brominating a feed gas stream containing predominately C3+ components, with acceptable amounts of C2 components. The gas stream containing predominately C3+ alkyl bromides may be cooled or heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger, to about 150° C. to about 300° C., and more preferably from about 225° C. to about 275° C., before being introduced into to a first synthesis reactor 52. In the first synthesis reactor 52, the alkyl bromides are reacted exothermically at a temperature range of from about 150° C. to about 300° C., and more preferably from about 225° C. to about 275° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst 53 to produce desired hydrocarbons products 54 (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these conditions propyl bromide is more reactive than methyl bromide or ethyl bromide over a suitable catalyst thereby preferentially oligomerizing the propyl units thereby forming hydrocarbon products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain a substantial C6+ paraffin content and thus a reduced aromatic content. In the first synthesis reactor 52, only a portion of the mono-brominated alkanes present in the alkyl bromides is converted, and any poly-brominated alkanes which may be present may have a lower propensity to be converted to heavy products or “coke” which deposit on the catalyst, due to the presence of propyl bromide and the lower temperature conditions. As previously mentioned, the particular catalyst used in both the first and second synthesis reactors 52 and 57 of FIG. 4 will depend, for example, upon the particular product hydrocarbons that are desired. For example, when product hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions are desired, a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst may be used. When it is desired to produce product hydrocarbons comprising a mixture of olefins and C5+ products, an X-type or Y-type zeolite catalyst or SAPO zeolite catalyst may be used. Examples of suitable zeolites include an X-type, such as 10-X, or Y-type zeolite, although other zeolites with differing pore sizes and acidities, may be used in embodiments of the present invention. The catalyst used in the first and second stage synthesis reactors need not be identical, particularly in instances where the effluent from the first and second reactors contained different product hydrocarbons, are being further processed in a different manner, or both of the foregoing. A block flow diagram generally depicting some aspects of certain embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 5. A feed gas stream 60 containing lower molecular weight alkanes may be pretreated to remove C2+ components prior to being combined with bromine vapor and conveyed to at least one C1+ bromination reactor 64. The concentration of C2+ components in the feed gas stream introduction into the C1+ bromination reactor 64 may be less than about 4.0 mol %, more preferably less than about 2.0 mol %, and most preferably less than about 0.5 mol %. While some C2+ hydrocarbons may be tolerated in the C1+ bromination reactor 64 in the embodiment of FIG. 5, higher concentrations than set forth above may result in the rapid formation of carbon-containing coke-like solids which cause fouling and plugging in the bromination reactor as well as downstream components. The feed gas to the processes and systems illustrated in FIG. 5 may be combined with the effluent 79 from the synthesis reactors 76 and 68 and pretreated in a product separation stage to selectively remove C2+ components and product hydrocarbons. More specifically, the feed gas, residual hydrocarbons and product hydrocarbons, e.g. high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, may be conveyed to a product separation unit 80. The high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof as well as C2+ components may be then separated from the feed gas resulting in a C1+ hydrocarbon stream 62 which is primarily methane with acceptable concentrations of C2+ lower molecular alkane components as described above. The C2+ components may also be separated from the product hydrocarbons in the product separation unit 80 and used in conjunction with a C2+ bromination reactor in a manner as hereinafter described, while the liquid hydrocarbon product may be removed as stream 61 from a product stabilizer column (not illustrated) in the product separation unit 80 for use or further petrochemical or fuel processing. The C1+ stream 62 may be combined with a bromine stream 88 prior to, upon introduction into or within at least one C1+ bromination reactor 64. The ratio of methane to bromine that may be utilized in the feed to the C1+ bromination reactor is a function of the C2+ content of the C1+ stream as well as the temperature. Lower C2+ content in the C1+ stream and operation at lower temperatures may allow operation at lower methane to bromine ratios. Hence with the appropriate control of the C2+ content of the C1+ stream, the molar ratio of methane to bromine in the feed to the C1+ bromination reactor 64 is less than about 7 to 1 but greater than about 1.25 to 1, and preferably less than about 4 to 1 but greater than about 2 to 1, and more preferably less than or equal to about 3 to 1 but greater than about 2.5 to 1. The C1+ stream 62 and a liquid bromine stream 88 may be mixed and conveyed to a heat exchanger (not illustrated) wherein the mixture is heated to a temperature between about 300° C. to about 550° C., but more preferably in the range of about 450° C. to about 500° C., and wherein the liquid bromine is vaporized and the bromination reaction is initiated. Further, in some embodiments, the dry bromine vapor in the mixture fed into the C1+ bromination reactor may be substantially water-free. Applicant has discovered that, at least in some instances, this may be preferred because it appears that elimination of substantially all water vapor from the bromination step substantially eliminates the formation of unwanted carbon dioxide. This may increase the selectivity of alkane bromination to alkyl bromides, thus possibly eliminating the large amount of waste heat generated in the formation of carbon dioxide from alkanes. The heated mixture, containing predominantly methane, acceptable amounts of C2+ lower molecular weight alkane components, and bromine vapor, may be introduced to a C1+ bromination reactor 64 wherein lower molecular weight alkanes, predominantly methane and an acceptable amount of C2+ lower molecular weight alkanes, present in the mixture are thermally brominated. If necessary, the C1+ bromination reactor 64 may contain an inlet pre-heater zone (not illustrated) to ensure that the mixture remains heated to a reaction initiation temperature in the range of about 300° C. to about 550° C. In the case of methane, the formation of methyl bromide is believed to occur in accordance with the following general reaction: [in-line-formulae]CH4(g)+Br2(g)→CH3Br(g)+HBr(g)[/in-line-formulae] Where substantially all of the elemental bromine has been reacted away, the effluent stream 65 from the C1+ bromination reactor 64 is a mixture of alkyl bromides and hydrogen bromide and unreacted lower molecular weight alkanes, predominately methane. The effluent stream 65 may be removed from the C1+ bromination reactor 64 and introduced directly into a high temperature synthesis reactor 68. The C1+ bromination reactor 64 may also contain a catalytic shift zone. The temperature of this feed to the catalytic shift zone may be in the range of about 350° C. to about 570° C., more preferably 500° C. to about 570° C., and most preferably 530° C. to about 570° C. As the C1+ thermal bromination reaction is exothermic, the feed gas and bromine introduced to the C1+ bromination reactor may be heated to a temperature within the about 300° C. to about 550° C. range to ensure that the effluent from the thermal bromination zone of the C1+ bromination reactor 64 is within the desired range for introduction into the catalytic shift zone given the reactor operating conditions of the thermal bromination reactor as will be evident to a skilled artisan. Alternatively, the effluent mixture from the thermal bromination zone or reactor may be heated or cooled to a temperature within the range of about 350° C. to about 570° C. prior to contact with the catalyst employed in the catalytic shift zone by any suitable means (not illustrated) as evident to a skilled artisan. The catalyst useful in the catalytic shift zone of the C1+ bromination reactor in the embodiment of the processes of the present invention illustrated generally in FIG. 5 may be a metallic element that is capable of forming both metal halides or metal oxy-halides, or mixtures thereof, and include Fe, Mo, La, Ce, W, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, Zn, Mn, V, Nb, Ta, Ti, Y, Zr, Mg and Ca. Halogens that may be useful for the formation of catalytically-active metal halides or metal oxy-halides are Br, Cl and F, with Br being preferred. While the catalyst may be initially prepared as a metal bromide dispersed on a catalyst support, it is generally more common to disperse a metal oxide by an incipient wetness technique utilizing a metal nitrate solution precursor, followed by drying and calcination at high-temperature in air or other oxidizing gas mixture. Further, as many metal bromide salts are hygroscopic, handling, storage and transport may require special measures. Accordingly the catalyst used in the catalytic shift zone may be most practically, commercially available in only the metal oxide state. Such a metal oxide catalyst may be initially employed in the catalytic shift zone within reactor 64 of FIG. 5 as it will be converted into a metal bromide or metal oxy-bromide, or mixtures thereof over time due to the reaction thereof with hydrogen bromide, methyl bromide, di-bromomethane or other alkyl bromides. However, as activity of a metal oxide catalyst in the catalytic shift zone is appreciably less than that of a metal bromide or metal oxy-bromide and carbon losses or coking is increased until conversion is completed, it may be desirable to convert the initial metal oxide catalyst in-situ to a metal bromide or metal oxy-bromide, or mixtures thereof prior to introduction of feed into the catalytic shift zone or reactor by any suitable means, such as by reaction with hydrogen bromide and a carrier gas, for example methane or nitrogen. In the catalytic shift zone, a significant portion of the di- and tri-brominated alkanes that may be present in the alkyl bromides contained in the effluent from the thermal bromination zone may be selectively converted upon reaction with the unreacted alkane components, predominantly methane, present in the feed, to mono-brominated alkanes. As an example, where C1 and di-bromomethane are the reactants, it is believed that the conversion occurs in accordance with the following general reaction: [in-line-formulae]CH4+CH2Br2→2CH3Br[/in-line-formulae] Due to the high temperatures in the both the thermal and catalytic zones, elemental bromine is likely to be essentially completely converted. It is believed that the catalyst used in the catalytic shift zone or reactor promotes a selective reaction of di-bromomethane with methane to yield methyl bromide via a selective catalytic reaction of bromine (supplied by dissociative adsorption of di-bromomethane on the catalyst surface) with methane. The effluent from the catalytic shift zone of the C1+ bromination reactor which contains a significantly increased ratio of mono-brominated alkanes to di- or tri-brominated alkanes may then be transported to a high temperature synthesis reactor 68. While the thermal and catalytic shift zones have been described above as contained within a single C1+ bromination reactor 64, these zones can each be contained in at least two separate reactors arranged in series as will be evident to a skilled artisan. The effluent stream 65 from the C1+ bromination reactor may be cooled or heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 66, before being introduced into a high temperature synthesis reactor 68. In the high temperature synthesis reactor, the methyl and ethyl bromides may be reacted exothermically at a temperature in the range of about 300° C. to about 450° C., and more preferably in the range of about 350° C. to about 425° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst to produce a stream 67 of desired hydrocarbon products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these conditions the methyl bromides and ethyl bromides are reactive over a suitable catalyst to preferentially oligomerize the methyl and ethyl units thereby forming hydrocarbon products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain C7+ fractions having primarily substituted aromatics and also light alkanes primarily in the C3 to C5+ range. A stream 70 of C2+ components may be produced by the process or contained in the feed gas which are removed in the product separation unit 80 so that the feed to the C1+ bromination reactor contains an acceptable amount of C2+. The excess C2+ and in particular C3+ may be separately processed in a C2+ thermal bromination reactor 72 using a slip stream 89 of the liquid bromine feed. The C2+ thermal bromination reactor 72 operates at an alkane to bromine ratio of in the range of about 4 to 1 to about 1.25 to 1, and preferably in the range of about 2 to 1 to about 1.5 to 1 and at a temperature in the range of about 250° C. to 550° C. The C2+ bromination reactor 72 may also contain a catalytic shift zone, as discussed above with respect to the C1+ bromination reactor 64. The effluent 73 from the C2+ thermal bromination reactor contains various alkyl bromides and hydrogen bromide may be cooled or heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 74, to about 150° C. to about 300° C., more preferably from about 225° C. to about 275° C., before being introduced into to a low temperature synthesis reactor 76. In the low temperature synthesis reactor, the alkyl bromides may be reacted exothermically at a temperature range of from about 150° C. to about 300° C., and more preferably from about 225° C. to about 275° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst 77 to produce desired hydrocarbons products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these conditions propyl bromide is more reactive than methyl bromide or ethyl bromide over a suitable catalyst thereby preferentially oligomerizing the propyl units thereby forming hydrocarbons products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain a substantial C6+ paraffin content and thus a reduced aromatic content. In the first stage synthesis reactor, only a portion of the mono-brominated alkanes present in the alkyl bromides may be converted, and any poly-brominated alkanes which may be present may have a lower propensity to be converted to heavy products or “coke” which deposit on the catalyst, due to the presence of propyl bromide and the lower temperature conditions. The catalyst 77 and 69 employed in the low temperature and high temperature synthesis reactors 76 and 68, respectively, may be any of a variety of suitable materials for catalyzing the conversion of the alkyl bromides to product hydrocarbons as previously set forth. In certain embodiments, the low temperature and high temperature synthesis reactors may comprise a fixed bed of the catalyst. A fluidized-bed of synthesis catalyst may also be used in certain circumstances, particularly in larger applications and may have certain advantages, such as constant removal of coke and a steady selectivity to product composition. The particular catalyst used in both the low temperature and high temperature synthesis reactors will depend, for example, upon the particular product hydrocarbons that are desired. For example, when product hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions are desired, a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst may be used. When it is desired to produce product hydrocarbons comprising a mixture of olefins and C5+ products, an X-type or Y-type zeolite catalyst or SAPO zeolite catalyst may be used. Examples of suitable zeolites include an X-type, such as 10-X, or Y-type zeolite, although other zeolites with differing pore sizes and acidities, may be used in embodiments of the present invention. The catalyst used in the low temperature and high temperature synthesis reactors need not be identical so long as the catalyst used in both reactors are selected to form the similar products, e.g. selected to form hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions. The effluent streams 78 and 67 from the low temperature and the high temperature synthesis reactors 76 and 68, respectively, may be combined into one synthesis effluent stream 79 and cooled by suitable means such as heat exchanger 71 to recover heat for use elsewhere in the process, such as to produce steam or preheat feed to the process (not shown) or for other uses as determined by the skilled artisan, and then conveyed to a product separation stage 80. Hydrogen bromide may be removed from the hydrocarbon product, e.g. high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, and a stream 82 of hydrogen bromide may be conveyed to a bromide oxidation stage 84 wherein hydrogen bromide may be neutralized by a partially oxidized metal bromide salt to yield a metal bromide salt and steam. A stream 86 of oxygen or air may be introduced to the bromide oxidation stage 84 to contact the resultant metal bromide so as to yield elemental bromine. A stream 88 of bromine may be recycled to the bromination stage as a dry bromine vapor and a partially oxidized metal bromide salt which may be used to neutralize and remove additional hydrogen bromide from the hydrocarbons produced by the process. The steam produced from the oxidation of the HBr with partially oxidized metal bromide salt may be condensed, stripped of any residual bromine, and removed as a byproduct liquid water product 87. A block flow diagram generally depicting some aspects of certain embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 6 and is similar to that illustrated in FIG. 5 and described above except that effluent from the C1+ bromination reactor is combined with recycled poly-bromides, heated and thermally reacted so as to convert poly-brominated alkanes present in the alkyl bromide stream to mono-brominated alkanes prior to introduction into the high temperature synthesis reactor 68. As illustrated in FIG. 6, the effluent stream 65 from the C1+ bromination reactor, which is a mixture of alkyl bromides and hydrogen bromide, may be combined with recycled poly-bromides and the mixture subsequently heated to a temperature of from about 450° C. to about 570° C. by any suitable means, such as heat exchanger, and transported to reproportionation reactor 92 wherein at least a portion of the poly-brominated alkanes present in the effluent stream are converted to mono-brominated alkanes. Reproportionation reactor 92 may be a relatively long, open-ended tube to allow sufficient residence time, preferably in the range of approximately 15 to 60 seconds to permit conversion of at least a portion of the poly-brominated alkanes present in the effluent stream to mono-brominated alkanes. The effluent stream 93 from the reproportionation reactor 92 may then be cooled by any suitable means, such as heat exchanger 94, and introduced into a fractionation column 95 wherein poly-brominated alkanes, e.g. bi- and tri-brominated alkanes, are removed from the effluent. The fractionation column bottom liquid stream 99 which contains such poly-brominated alkanes may be passed to the fractionator reboiler 100 which vaporizes a fraction of the liquid, stripping the residual lighter mono-brominated alkanes from the heavier poly-brominated alkanes in the liquid. The residual light mono-brominated alkanes may be recycled to the fractionator 95 as stream 101. Stream 102 containing poly-brominated alkanes may be combined with effluent stream 65 from the C1+ bromination reactor and preheated to a temperature of about 450° C. to about 570° C. prior to introduction into reproportionation reactor 92 wherein the poly-brominated alkanes are reacted with C1+ to further form predominately mono-brominated alkanes. The fractionator overhead vapor stream 96 which been separated from the poly-brominated alkanes in the fractionation column may be conveyed to a condenser 97 wherein any remaining poly-brominated alkanes may be condensed and refluxed as stream 98 to the fractionation column 95. The remaining stream 96 comprising predominately alkyl bromides and hydrogen bromide may be heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 66, before being introduced into a high temperature synthesis reactor 68 in accordance with the embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 described above in detail. The remaining streams and process equipment illustrated in FIG. 6 are operated in accordance with the embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 5 and described above in detail. A block flow diagram generally depicting some aspects of certain embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 7 and is similar to that illustrated in FIG. 3 and described above except that C2+ components are separately brominated before being combined with the brominated feed gas stream and passed to two synthesis stages. Also, a shift/reproportionation reactor is not utilized in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 7. As illustrated in FIG. 7, a feed gas stream 120 containing lower molecular weight alkanes may be pretreated to remove C2+ components prior to being combined with bromine vapor and conveyed to a bromination reactor 124. The concentration of C2+ components in the feed gas stream 122 introduced into the bromination reactor 124 may be less than about 4.0 mol %, more preferably less than about 2.0 mol %, and most preferably less than about 0.5 mol %. While some C2+ hydrocarbons may be tolerated in the C1+ bromination reactor 124 in the embodiment of FIG. 7, higher concentrations thereof may result in the rapid formation of carbon-containing coke-like solids which may cause significant fouling and plugging in the bromination reactor as well as downstream components. As illustrated in FIG. 7, the feed gas stream may be combined with the effluent from the second stage synthesis reactor 136, e.g. product hydrocarbons and residual hydrocarbons, and pretreated in a product separation stage 140 to selectively remove C2+ components and product hydrocarbons. More specifically, the feed gas, residual hydrocarbons and product hydrocarbons, e.g. high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, may be conveyed to the product separation stage 140. The high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof as well as some C2+ components may be then separated from the feed gas and process recycle gas to form a C4+ liquid product stream 121. The feed gas and recycle gas are further processed to form a feed stream 122 for C1+ bromination reactor 124 and a gas stream 123 which is predominately C3+ lower molecular weight alkane components with excess C2 that is not able to be included in feed stream 122 due to C2+ concentration limitations. The feed stream 122 which is primarily methane with acceptable concentrations of C2+ lower molecular alkane components as noted above may be combined with bromine via stream 148 prior to, upon introduction into or within a bromination reactor. Gas stream 123 which is predominately C3+ lower molecular weight alkane components with excess C2 may be used in conjunction with a C2+ bromination reactor 126 in a manner as hereinafter described, while the liquid hydrocarbon product 121 may be removed from the product separation stage for use or further petrochemical or fuel processing. As illustrated in FIG. 7, the feed stream 122 containing predominantly methane and acceptable amounts of C2+ lower molecular weight alkane components may be reacted exothermically in the C1+ bromination reactor 124 with dry bromine vapor at a relatively low temperature in the range of about 250° C. to about 600° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 bar to about 30 bar to produce gaseous alkyl bromides and hydrogen bromide vapors. As will be evident to a skilled artisan with the benefit of this disclosure, the bromination reaction in C1+ bromination reactor 124 may be a homogeneous (thermal) reaction or a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. Suitable catalysts, operating temperature ranges and the alkane to bromine ratio employed in the C1+ bromination reactor 124 are as previously set forth above with respect to bromination reactor 24 in FIG. 3. Gas stream 123 which is predominately C3+ lower molecular weight alkane components with excess C2 may be reacted exothermically in the C2+ thermal bromination reactor 126 with dry bromine vapor at a relatively low temperature in the range of about 250° C. to about 600° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 bar to about 30 bar to produce gaseous alkyl bromides and hydrogen bromide vapors in a manner as described above with respect to C1+ bromination reactor 124. The C2+ bromination reactor 126 may also contain a catalytic shift zone, as discussed above with respect to the C1+ bromination reactor 64 in FIG. 5. Stream 127 containing the effluent from C2+ bromination reactor 126 that comprises higher alkyl bromides, hydrogen bromide and unreacted alkanes may be combined with stream 125 containing the effluent withdrawn from the C1+ bromination reactor 124 that comprises alkyl bromides, hydrogen bromide and unreacted methane. This combined stream may be cooled or heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 128, to about 150° C. to about 350° C., more preferably from about 225° C. to about 325° C., before being introduced into a first stage synthesis reactor 132. In the first stage (low temperature) synthesis reactor 132, the alkyl bromides may be reacted exothermically at a temperature range of from about 150° C. to about 350° C., and more preferably from about 225° C. to about 325° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst 33 to produce desired hydrocarbons products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these conditions propyl bromide is more reactive than methyl bromide or ethyl bromide over a suitable catalyst thereby preferentially oligomerizing the propyl units thereby forming hydrocarbon products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain a substantial C6+ paraffin content and thus a reduced aromatic content. Also, it is believed that propyl bromide and any unreacted propane may act as a hydrogen donor thereby permitting a larger portion of any poly-brominated alkanes, particularly, dibromomethane, to be converted to higher molecular weight hydrocarbon products at these lower temperature conditions and over a suitable catalyst, rather than to heavy products or “coke” which deposit on the catalyst. Thus, the yield of useful products and the operating efficiency of the processes of the present invention may be increased. However, at the relatively low operating temperature in the first stage synthesis reactor 132, only a portion of the mono-brominated alkanes present in the alkyl bromides may be converted. The effluent 134 from the first stage synthesis reactor may be heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 135, before being introduced into a second stage (high temperature) synthesis reactor 136. Effluent 134 contains hydrocarbon products and unreacted alkyl (methyl and ethyl) bromides. In the second stage synthesis reactor 136, the methyl and ethyl bromides may be reacted exothermically at a temperature in the range of about 350° C. to about 450° C., and more preferably in the range of about 375° C. to about 425° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst to produce desired hydrocarbon products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these conditions the methyl bromides and ethyl bromides are reactive over a suitable catalyst to preferentially oligomerize the methyl and ethyl units thereby forming hydrocarbon products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain C7+ fractions having primarily substituted aromatics and also light alkanes primarily in the C3 to C5+ range. Since a significant portion of the poly-brominated alkanes may be reacted or removed in the low temperature synthesis reactor 132, the product selectivity may be increased and coke formation reduced in the second stage (high temperature) synthesis reactor 136. The catalyst 133 and 137 employed in the first and second stage synthesis reactors 132 and 136, respectively, may be any of a variety of suitable materials for catalyzing the conversion of the alkyl bromides to product hydrocarbons as previously set forth. In certain embodiments, the first and second stage synthesis reactors may comprise a fixed bed of the catalyst. A fluidized-bed of synthesis catalyst may also be used in certain circumstances, particularly in larger applications and may have certain advantages, such as constant removal of coke and a steady selectivity to product composition. The particular catalyst used in both the first and second stage synthesis reactors 132 and 136 will depend, for example, upon the particular product hydrocarbons that are desired. For example, when product hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions are desired, a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst may be used. When it is desired to produce product hydrocarbons comprising a mixture of olefins and C5+ products, an X-type or Y-type zeolite catalyst or SAPO zeolite catalyst may be used. Examples of suitable zeolites include an X-type, such as 10-X, or Y-type zeolite, although other zeolites with differing pore sizes and acidities, may be used in embodiments of the present invention. The catalyst used in the first and second stage synthesis reactors 132 and 136 need not be identical so long as the catalyst used in both reactors are selected to form the similar products, e.g. selected to form hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions. The effluent 138 from the second stage synthesis reactor 136 may be cooled by suitable means such as heat exchanger 139 to recover heat for use elsewhere in the process, such as to produce steam or preheat feed to the process (not shown) or for other uses as determined by the skilled artisan, and then conveyed to a product separation stage 140. Hydrogen bromide may be removed from the hydrocarbon product, e.g. high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, in the product separation stage and a stream 142 of separated hydrogen bromide may be conveyed to a bromide oxidation stage 144 wherein hydrogen bromide may be neutralized by a partially oxidized metal bromide salt to yield a metal bromide salt and steam. A stream 146 of oxygen or air may be introduced to the bromide oxidation stage 144 of the present invention to contact the resultant metal bromide salt so as to yield elemental bromine and a partially oxidized metal bromide salt which may be used to neutralize and remove additional hydrogen bromide from the hydrocarbons produced by the process. A stream 148 of bromine may be recycled to the bromination stage as a dry bromine vapor. The steam resulting from oxidation of the HBr with the partially oxidized metal bromide salt may be condensed, stripped of any residual bromine and withdrawn as a byproduct liquid water stream 149. The first stage synthesis reactor 132 and the second stage synthesis reactor 136 of the process embodiments illustrated in FIG. 7 may be contained within distinct zones or beds within the same reactor as depicted in FIG. 2 and described above. Each zone or bed may be fixed or fluidized and the reactor may be provided with a suitable means for heating the effluent from the first stage synthesis zone or bed, such as an internal or external heat exchanger, prior to flowing the same to the second stage synthesis zone or bed within the same reactor. A block flow diagram generally depicting some aspects of certain embodiments of the processes and systems of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 8 and is similar to that illustrated in FIG. 5 and described above except that the effluent from the C1+ bromination reactor is combined with C2+ components prior to introduction to a low temperature synthesis reactor and the effluent therefrom is combined with the effluent from the from C2+ bromination reactor prior to introduction into a high temperature synthesis reactor. As illustrated in FIG. 8, a feed gas stream 160 containing lower molecular weight alkanes may be pretreated to remove C2+ components prior to being combined with bromine via stream 188 prior to, upon introduction into or within at least one C1+ bromination reactor 164. The concentration of C2+ components in the feed gas stream introduction into the C1+ bromination reactor 164 may be less than about 4.0 mol %, more preferably less than about 2.0 mol %, and most preferably less than about 0.5 mol %. While some C2+ hydrocarbons may be tolerated in the C1+ bromination reactor 164 in the embodiment of FIG. 8, higher concentrations than set forth above may result in the rapid formation of carbon-containing coke-like solids which cause fouling and plugging in the bromination reactor as well as downstream components. The feed gas to the processes and systems illustrated in FIG. 8 may be combined with the effluent 167 from the high temperature synthesis reactor 168 and pretreated in a product separation stage to selectively remove C2+ components and product hydrocarbons. More specifically, the feed gas, residual hydrocarbons and product hydrocarbons, e.g. high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, may be conveyed to a product separation unit 180. The high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof as well as C2+ components may be then separated from the feed gas resulting in a C1+ hydrocarbon stream 162 which is primarily methane with acceptable concentrations of C2+ lower molecular alkane components as described above. The C2+ components may also be separated from the product hydrocarbons in the product separation unit 180 and used in conjunction with a C2+ bromination reactor in a manner as hereinafter described, while the liquid hydrocarbon product may be removed as stream 161 from a product stabilizer column (not illustrated) in the product separation unit 180 for use or further petrochemical or fuel processing. The C1+ stream 162 may be combined with a bromine stream 188 prior to, upon introduction into or within at least one C1+ bromination reactor 164. The ratio of methane to bromine that may be utilized in the feed to the C1+ bromination reactor is a function of the C2+ content of the stream as well as the temperature. Lower C2+ content in the C1+ stream and operation at lower temperatures may allow operation at lower methane to bromine ratios. Hence with the appropriate control of the C2+ content of the C1+ stream, the molar ratio of methane to bromine in the feed to the C1+ bromination reactor 164 is less than about 7 to 1 but greater than about 1.25 to 1, and preferably less than about 4 to 1 but greater than about 2 to 1, and more preferably less than or equal to about 3 to 1 but greater than about 2.5 to 1. The C1+ stream 162 and a liquid bromine stream 188 may be mixed and conveyed to a heat exchanger (not illustrated) wherein the mixture is heated to a temperature between about 300° C. to about 550° C., but more preferably in the range of about 450° C. to about 500° C., and wherein the liquid bromine is vaporized and the bromination reaction is initiated. Further, in some embodiments, the dry bromine vapor in the mixture fed into the C1+ bromination reactor may be substantially water-free. Applicant has discovered that, at least in some instances, this may be preferred because it appears that elimination of substantially all water vapor from the bromination step substantially eliminates the formation of unwanted carbon dioxide. This may increase the selectivity of alkane bromination to alkyl bromides, thus possibly eliminating the large amount of waste heat generated in the formation of carbon dioxide from alkanes. The heated mixture, containing predominantly methane, acceptable amounts of C2+ lower molecular weight alkane components, and bromine vapor, may be introduced to a C1+ bromination reactor 164 wherein lower molecular weight alkanes, predominantly methane and an acceptable amount of C2+ lower molecular weight alkanes, present in the mixture are thermally brominated. If necessary, the C1+ bromination reactor 164 may contain an inlet pre-heater zone (not illustrated) to ensure that the mixture remains heated to a reaction initiation temperature in the range of about 300° C. to about 550° C. As will be evident to a skilled artisan with the benefit of this disclosure, the bromination reaction in C1+ bromination reactor 164 may be a homogeneous (thermal) reaction or a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. Suitable catalysts, operating temperature ranges and the alkane to bromine ratio employed in the C1+ bromination reactor 124 are as previously set forth above with respect to bromination reactor 24 in FIG. 5. A stream 170 of C2+ components may be produced by the process or contained in the feed gas which are removed in the product separation unit 180 so that the feed to the C1+ bromination contains an acceptable amount of C2+. The excess C2+ and in particular C3+ may be separately processed in a C2+ thermal bromination reactor 172 using a slip stream 189 of the liquid bromine feed. The C2+ thermal bromination reactor 172 operates at an alkane to bromine ratio of in the range of about 4 to 1 to about 1.25 to 1, and preferably in the range of about 2 to 1 to about 1.5 to 1 and at a temperature in the range of about 250° C. to 550° C. The C2+ thermal bromination reactor 172 may also contain a catalytic shift zone, as discussed above with respect to the C1+ bromination reactor 64 of FIG. 5. A slip stream 171 of C2+ components may be combined with the effluent stream 165 from the C1+ bromination reactor and cooled or heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 174, to about 150° C. to about 350° C., more preferably from about 225° C. to about 325° C., before being introduced into a low temperature synthesis reactor 176. In the low temperature synthesis reactor, the alkyl bromides may be reacted exothermically at a temperature range of from about 150° C. to about 350° C., and more preferably from about 225° C. to about 325° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst 33 to produce desired hydrocarbons products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these conditions propyl bromide is more reactive than methyl bromide or ethyl bromide over a suitable catalyst thereby preferentially oligomerizing the propyl units thereby forming hydrocarbon products, for example high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, that contain a substantial C6+ paraffin content and thus a reduced aromatic content. It is also believed that the C2+ components, particularly propane, may act as a hydrogen donor to allow a larger portion of any poly-brominated alkanes, particularly, dibromomethane, to be converted to higher molecular weight hydrocarbon products at these lower temperature conditions and over a suitable catalyst, rather than to heavy products or “coke” which deposit on the catalyst. Thus, the yield of useful products and the operating efficiency of the processes of the present invention may be increased. However, at the relatively low operating temperature in the first stage synthesis reactor 176, only a portion of the mono-brominated alkanes present in the alkyl bromides may be converted. The effluent 178 from the low temperature synthesis reactor 176 may be combined with the effluent 173 from the C2+ thermal bromination reactor that contains various alkyl bromides and hydrogen bromide and the mixture may be cooled or heated by any suitable means, such as a heat exchanger 166, before being introduced into a second stage or high temperature synthesis reactor 168. In instances where it is desired to increase paraffinic hydrocarbon yield, the effluent from the C2+ thermal bromination reactor may be introduced into a separate low temperature synthesis reactor and the effluent from this low temperature reactor combined with effluent from reactor 176 and the mixture transported to the second stage or high temperature synthesis reactor 168. In the high temperature synthesis reactor, the methyl and ethyl bromides may be reacted exothermically at a temperature in the range of about 350° C. to about 450° C., and more preferably in the range of about 375° C. to about 425° C., and at a pressure in the range of about 1 to about 100 bar, over a suitable catalyst to produce a stream 67 of desired hydrocarbon products (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof). It is believed that at these higher temperature conditions, a more complete conversion of the methyl bromides and other alkyl bromides, such as ethyl and propyl bromides, to hydrocarbon products is achieved. The catalyst 177 and 169 employed in the low temperature and high temperature synthesis reactors 176 and 168, respectively, may be any of a variety of suitable materials for catalyzing the conversion of the alkyl bromides to product hydrocarbons as previously set forth. In certain embodiments, the low temperature and high temperature synthesis reactors may comprise a fixed bed of the catalyst. A fluidized-bed of synthesis catalyst may also be used in certain circumstances, particularly in larger applications and may have certain advantages, such as constant removal of coke and a steady selectivity to product composition. The particular catalyst used in both the low temperature and high temperature synthesis reactors will depend, for example, upon the particular product hydrocarbons that are desired. For example, when product hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions are desired, a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst may be used. When it is desired to produce product hydrocarbons comprising a mixture of olefins and C5+ products, an X-type or Y-type zeolite catalyst or SAPO zeolite catalyst may be used. Examples of suitable zeolites include an X-type, such as 10-X, or Y-type zeolite, although other zeolites with differing pore sizes and acidities may be used in embodiments of the present invention. The catalyst used in the low temperature and high temperature synthesis reactors need not be identical so long as the catalyst used in both reactors are selected to form the similar products, e.g. selected to form hydrocarbons having primarily C3, C4 and C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions. The low temperature synthesis reactor 176 and the high temperature synthesis reactor 168 of the process embodiments illustrated in FIG. 8 may be contained within distinct zones or beds within the same reactor as depicted in FIG. 2 and described above and modified to provide for a side feed for introduction of effluent 173 as will be evident to a skilled artisan. Each zone or bed may be fixed or fluidized and the reactor may be provided with a suitable means for heating the effluent from the first stage synthesis zone or bed, such as an internal or external heat exchanger, prior to flowing the same to the second stage synthesis zone or bed within the same reactor. The effluent stream 167 from the high temperature synthesis reactors 168 may be cooled by suitable means such as heat exchanger 171 to recover heat for use elsewhere in the process, such as to produce steam or preheat feed to the process (not shown) or for other uses as determined by the skilled artisan, and then conveyed to a product separation stage 180. Hydrogen bromide may be removed from the hydrocarbon product, e.g. high molecular weight hydrocarbons, olefins or mixtures thereof, and a stream 182 of hydrogen bromide may be conveyed to a bromide oxidation stage 184 wherein hydrogen bromide may be neutralized by a partially oxidized metal bromide salt to yield a metal bromide salt and steam. A stream 186 of oxygen or air may be introduced to the bromide oxidation stage 184 to contact the resultant metal bromide so as to yield elemental bromine and a partially oxidized metal bromide salt which may be used to neutralize and remove additional hydrogen bromide from the hydrocarbons produced by the process. A stream 188 of bromine may be recycled to the bromination stage as a dry bromine vapor. The steam produced from the oxidation of the HBr with partially oxidized metal bromide salt may be condensed, stripped of any residual bromine, and removed as a byproduct liquid water product 187. Where a feed gas contains a substantial amount of gases suitable for use as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), such LPG may be separated from the feed gas for use as an end product or as an intermediate feedstock for another process. Alternatively, it may be desirable to convert such LPG to product hydrocarbons, for example C5+ gasoline-range paraffinic compounds and heavier hydrocarbon fractions, which may have greater value and use. The block flow diagrams generally depicting some aspects of certain embodiments of the present invention illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 and described above provide processes and systems for converting C3+ components of a feed gas, i.e. LPG components to product hydrocarbons. While the foregoing preferred embodiments of the invention have been described and shown, it is understood that the alternatives and modifications, such as those suggested and others, may be made thereto and fall within the scope of the invention. 1.
