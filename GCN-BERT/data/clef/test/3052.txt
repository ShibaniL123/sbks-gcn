TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to electronic cigarettes, and particularly to an atomizer and an electronic cigarette using same. BACKGROUND ART Electronic cigarettes are similar to conventional cigarettes in both appearance and taste, but less harmful to human's health. Accordingly, electronic cigarettes are widely used for helping people to quit smoking. Atomizers are key components of the electronic cigarettes. In a typical atomizer, a glass fiber core is disposed horizontally through an air pipe to get a tobacco liquid in a liquid reserving chamber. However, the atomizer is not unaesthetic on one hand, on the other hand, the glass fiber core may detach from the air pipe after a long-time use, especially when the atomizer falls on ground. Therefore, what is needed, is an atomizer and an electronic cigarette having same, which can overcome the above shortcomings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of the present disclosure will now be described in detail below and with references to the drawings. Referring to FIGS. 1-3, an atomizer 100 includes an atomizing sleeve 10, a mouthpiece 11 inserted into one end of the atomizing sleeve 10, and an atomizing assembly 13 fixed in the atomizing sleeve 10. The atomizing sleeve 10 is made of a transparent material, and defines a liquid reserving space 12 therein. The liquid reserving space 12 is configured for reserving a tobacco liquid. The atomizing sleeve 10 includes a fixing sleeve 131, a porous body 132 disposed in the fixing sleeve 131, and a connector 139 arranged at the other end of the atomizing sleeve 10. The connector 139 is configured for connecting an external device, for example, a power supply device. The fixing sleeve 131 includes an upper part 131a, a middle part 131b and a lower part 131c. The upper part 131a, middle part 131b, and lower part 131c are interconnected and integrally formed. The upper part 131a extends upwards and is substantially level to one end of the atomizing sleeve 10, and the lower part 131c extends downwards and is substantially level to the other end of the atomizing sleeve 10. Each of the upper part 131a, the middle part 131b, and the lower part 131c is cylindrical, outer diameters of the upper part 131a, the middle part 131b and the lower part 131c increase in sequence. In addition, an aerosol passage is formed in an inner space of the upper part 131a, middle part 131b, and the lower part 131c, so that an air pipe is not needed. Two liquid openings 130 are respectively formed at a peripheral wall of the middle part 131b, preferably, the two liquid openings 130 are symmetrically arranged about a central axis of the middle part 131b. The liquid openings 130 are in communicate with an inner space of the middle part 131b and the liquid reserving space 12, so that the porous body 132 can absorb tobacco liquid from the liquid reserving space 12 through the two liquid openings 130. In the present embodiment, the two liquid openings 130 are square-shaped, in other embodiments, the two liquid openings 130 can be circular or polygonal or other shapes. As known, a size of the liquid opening 130 can control a liquid absorbing ability of the porous body 132. Preferably, in other embodiments, only one liquid opening 130 can be formed in the middle part 131b when the porous body 132 can absorb enough tobacco liquid. The porous body 132 is made of ceramic and is hollow inside, and the side wall of the porous body 132 is microporous to absorb and reserve a part of the tobacco liquid. In the present embodiment, the porous body 132 is cylindrical-shaped and has a cylindrical surface facing towards the liquid opening 130 to absorb the tobacco liquid, besides, the larger the cylindrical surface contacts the liquid opening 130, the more the tobacco liquid can be absorbed. An atomizing space 133 is formed in the porous body 132, and the atomizing space 133 is cone-shaped, with an inner diameter of the atomizing space 133 decreasing in sequence from the bottom to the top of the middle part 131b. A heating coil 134 configured for heating the tobacco liquid absorbed from the porous body 132 is fixed in the atomizing space 133. The heating coil 134 is helical formed along an axial direction and is fixed in the porous body 132. Specially, the cone-shaped atomizing space 133 can be beneficial for the heating coil 134's assembly. Specifically, a top liquid stopper 135 is fixed above the porous body 132, and a bottom liquid stopper 136 is fixed below the porous body 132. In addition, the top liquid stopper 135 abuts with the upper part 131a of the fixing sleeve 131, and the bottom liquid stopper 136 abuts with the lower part 131c of the fixing sleeve 131. Two through holes are respectively formed in the center of the top liquid stopper 135 and the center of the bottom liquid stopper 136, and communicate with the aerosol passage of the fixing sleeve 131 and the atomizing space 133 of the porous body 132. Both the top liquid stopper 135 and the bottom liquid stopper 136 are made of silicone material, thus preventing the un-atomized tobacco liquid from the side wall of porous body 132 from leaking into the fixing sleeve 131. In the present embodiment, two protruding flanges 131d are respectively arranged at the upper part 131a and the lower part 131c of the fixing sleeve 131 to fix the top liquid stopper 135 and the bottom liquid stopper 136, in addition, the flange 131d of the upper part 131a protrudes outwards, and the flange 131d of the lower part 131c protrudes inwards. In other embodiments, a slot for reserving tobacco liquid can be fixed on the flange 131d, or the flange can be directly made of silicone, such that the top liquid stopper 135 and the bottom liquid stopper 136 can be avoided. A wire groove 138 is formed on a side wall of the bottom liquid stopper 136. One end 134b of the heating coil 134 is electrically connected to the connector 139 through the wire groove 138, and the other end 134a of the heating coil 134 is electrically connected to the connector 139 through the through hole of the bottom liquid stopper 136 and the aerosol passage of the lower part 131c. In the present embodiment, the connector 139 includes a conductive screw sleeve 139a, an electrode ring 139b fixed in the screw sleeve 139a, and an insulating ring 139c fixed between the screw sleeve 139a and the electrode ring 139b, the screw sleeve 139a can be configured as a negative electrode, and the electrode ring 139b can be configured as a positive electrode. In conclusion, the porous body 132 is arranged in the fixing sleeve 131 and absorbs tobacco liquid through the liquid opening 130 formed on the fixing sleeve 131, an atomizing space is formed in the porous body 132, an aerosol passage 133 is formed in the fixing sleeve 131 and communicates with the atomizing space, thus the atomizing assembly 13 has a compact structure, convenient assembly, and better atomizing effect, the atomizer 10 having an aesthetic appearance. Referring to FIG. 4, an atomizer in accordance with a second embodiment is provided. A liquid reserving member 140 wraps around a periphery of a middle part 131b of an atomizing assembly, and a porous body 132 absorbs a tobacco liquid from the liquid reserving member 140 through a liquid opening. A wrapping quantity of the liquid reserving member 140 depends on practical necessity, however, excess tobacco liquid being absorbed into the porous body 132 with a fast velocity will lead to the tobacco liquid cannot be atomized in time, therefore, a liquid absorbing quantity and a liquid absorbing velocity of the porous body 132 can be controlled by the liquid reserving member 140, thus preventing the tobacco liquid from being absorbed into the porous body 132 too much and too fast. Referring to FIG. 5, an atomizer in accordance with a third embodiment is provided. A porous body 132 has a periphery, at least partially the periphery of the porous body 132 has a liquid reserving member 150 wrapped thereon. The liquid reserving member 150 is fixed in a middle part 131b of a fixing sleeve and faces towards a liquid opening 130 to absorb tobacco liquid. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 6, an electronic cigarette including an atomizer 100 and a power supply 200 in accordance with a fourth embodiment is provided. In the present embodiment, the power supply 200 is detachably connected to a connector 139 of the atomizer 100 by screw connection, and is configured for providing electrical power to the atomizer 100. The atomizer 100 can be any atomizer of the first embodiment to the third embodiment.
