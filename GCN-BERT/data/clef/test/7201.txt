Example 3. Synthesis and Characterization of N1-ferrocenylmethyl-N1, N1, N2, N2, N2-pentamethylpropane-1,2-diaminium dibromide (FcN2)
A 100 mL Schlenk flask was degassed with N2 and maintained under N2. (Ferrocenylmethyl)dimethylamine (3.4 g, 14 mmol) in 20 mL CH3CN and (3-Bromopropyl)trimethylammonium bromide (3.4 g, 13 mmol) in 10 mL DMSO were combined in the 100 mL flask. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h. The formed dark orange precipitate was collected by filtration. Afterward, 50 mL of ether was added to the supernatant solution to precipitate a second crop of product. The combined product was washed with 50 mL ether twice and dried under vacuum. The product was hygroscopic and stored in a dry desiccator. The yield is approximately 68.4% (4.65 g).
FcN2 was further characterized for use as a redox active material in an AORFB. Cyclic voltammogram of FcN2 displayed at a Fe3+/2+ redox wave at 0.62 V vs NHE using MV (âˆ’0.45 V vs NHE) as reference in NaCl (0.5 M) solution (FIG. 25). Also, it gave 1.07 V cell voltage for the FcN2/MV redox flow battery. The prototype cell study of the FcN2/MV redox flow battery was performed using 0.5 M FcN2 in 2.0 M NaCl solution and 0.5 M MV in 2.0 M NaCl solution. The cell was tested for 200 cycles at 60 mA/cm2 using Selemion AMV membrane with excellent capacity retention above 93% (FIG. 26). Coulombic efficiency stays approximately 100% while energy efficiency remained above 51%.
