DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIG. 1 thereof, the preferred embodiment of the new and improved cat muzzle system embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described. The present invention, the cat muzzle system 10 is comprised of a plurality of components. Such components in their broadest context include a muzzle, a restraint and coupling elements. Such components are individually configured and correlated with respect to each other so as to attain the desired objective. The present invention is a cat restraint/relaxation system 10 adapted to restrain and relax a cat while being examined and to cover portions of a face and mouth of the cat in order to provide protection to a caregiver. The system also functions to provide the caregiver the ability to examine aspects of the face and mouth of the cat while restrained and relaxed. The system so functions to restrain and relax the cat while protecting the cat and care giver. The examining and procedure are therefore done in a safe, convenient and economical manner. First provided is a muzzle 14. The muzzle is formed of a sheet 16 of a flexible, transparent, inextensible material in a circular configuration. The sheet includes a vertical center line and a horizontal center line. The sheet has a top and a bottom and laterally spaced sides. The sheet has a generally oval hole 18 equally spaced from the sides and closer to the bottom than to the top. The generally oval hole is adapted to provide access to the front teeth and lips of the cat. The sheet also has two laterally spaced rectangular holes 20 laterally spaced between the generally oval hole and the horizontal centerline. The rectangular holes are adapted to provide access to the rear teeth and lips of the cat. A restraint 24 is next provided. The restraint has a generally rectangular configuration. The restraint is positionable around the neck of the cat in a cylindrical configuration with a generally horizontal axis. The restraint has opposed free ends 26 with hook and loop fastener sections 28 secured to the restraint adjacent to free ends. The hook and loop fastener sections are adapted to be coupled to removably secure the restraint around the neck of the cat. The hook and loop fastener sections are adapted to be uncoupled to remove the restraint from around the neck of the cat. Provided lastly are attachment elements coupling the muzzle and the restraint. The attachment elements include an inextensible top strip 32. The top strip has a top forward element 34 attached to the muzzle adjacent to the top. The top strip has a top rearward element 36 attached to an upper extent of the restraint. The top strip has a length adjustable top buckle 38 removably coupling the top forward element and the top rearward element. The attachment elements includes two similarly configured, laterally spaced side strips 40 each having a side forward element 42 attached to the muzzle adjacent to the sides. Each side strip has a side rearward element 44 attached to the restraint at side extents of the restraint. Each side strip has a length adjustable side buckles 46 removably coupling the side forward element and the side rearward element. The attachment elements also include a bottom patch 50 having a forward edge 52 attached to the muzzle adjacent to the bottom. The bottom patch has a rearward edge 54 attached to a lower extent of the restraint. The bottom patch is fabricated of an elastic material. The present invention is a muzzle for cats. It is a device that provides protection to a care giver from a restrained cat and also allows the care giver the ability to examiner aspects of the retained cat. There are import features of the invention as follows: The muzzle around the face reduce the ability of the cat to open its mouth and harm the investigator with its teeth. Elements of the face that are normally obscured by other muzzles are fully visible. The surrounding molars may be examined along with the teeth and gums from a window on the muzzle. A circular opening at the tip of the muzzle allows vision and manipulation of the front lips exposing the canines, gum and incisors. It also allows for administration of medicines and sprays into the cat between the buccal and lingual gingiva. The clear muzzle over the face allows for better determination of dirt or body fluids on the muzzle once it leaves the cat. The smooth transparent plastic of the clear muzzle allows for easier cleaning of dirt or body fluids on the muzzle. The clear muzzle allows a veterinarian to evaluate systemic poisoning, neurological deficits, eye injury, or disease of the eye, that are not possible with existing muzzles that cover the eyes with non-transparent fabric. The connection of the clear muzzle over the face with the non-transparent portion over the neck is afforded by an adjustable strap. The strap can be tightened to maximize the secure fit of the entire muzzle upon the cat and prevent it from being torn off by the cat. The reduction of anxiety in the cat is afforded by the non-transparent portion being applied over the neck in an open non-threatening fashion. Closure is then enabled by velcro or other type fasteners placed along the entire dorsal aspect. Restraint of the cat is accomplished after the non-transparent portion is snugly placed over the neck and is tightly connected to the transparent portion over the cat's face. A relaxing, stupefying, tranquilizing effect on the cat is often produced by the application of the muzzle and aids in restraint. A padded fabric used over the non-transparent portion covering the neck increases the tightness of the muzzle and maximizes the mobilization effect. As to the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description. Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided. With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention. Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention. 1.
