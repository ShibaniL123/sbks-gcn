STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0003] This invention was made with government support under NIH grant NS084311. The government has certain rights in the invention. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0004] The present invention relates generally to the field of restoration of vision in patients suffering from retinal disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). More specifically, the invention provides new constructs, methods for delivering such constructs to a patient, and methods for restoring vision utilizing the new constructs. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0005] Vision is an essential component of human health that has physical and emotional, as well as psychological, importance in everyday life. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) refer to disorders characterized by degeneration of photoreceptors in the eye which hinders visual ability by non-functional neuronal activation and transmission of signals to the visual cortex. While AMD is the leading cause of new vision loss in about 15 million persons older than 65 years of age (5), the prevalence of RP is at least one million individuals world-wide. RP is most often inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with a large number of cases having this form of inheritance. Although genetic testing is available for RP, it may not be sufficient to assess the risk of passing the disorder from parent to offspring, and even proactive approaches may not be sufficient to prevent its occurrence. Further, the degree of visual loss increases with ageing and this is a major concern for our demographic changes towards elderly population. [0006] Although there is no definitive non-surgical therapy available for RP, numerous claims of therapeutic triumphs have been made in the United States and abroad within the last decade. Most of the current clinical treatments are primarily focused on slowing down the progression of the disease (8), as there is neither any cure that can stop the disease nor any therapy that can restore any vision lost due to this disease (9). [0007] The current treatment modality for partial restoration of vision for RP patients involves an invasive surgical procedure for retinal implants. Two different types of retinal implants are being developed: subretinal and epiretinal implants. The subretinal implants are positioned in the area of the retina where the photoreceptor cells reside, between the pigmented epithelium and the bipolar cells. These retinal prostheses have been primarily successful in generating visual perception in blind subjects. The disadvantages of using such subretinal implants include (i) chronic damage of the implanted electrodes, and (ii) insufficient current produced by the microphotodiode from the ambient light to stimulate adjacent neurons. The epiretinal implants are placed in the area of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the device functions by stimulating the axons of the RGCs in response to input obtained from a camera that is placed outside of the eye or within an intraocular lens. The disadvantages of epiretinal implants include (i) cellular outgrowth due to surgical implantation, and (ii) disordered stimulation pattern resulting from the electrical stimulation of both the axons and cell bodies of the RGCs. Besides being invasive in nature, these methods for restoration of vision in blind patients are based on non-specific cellular activation and have low spatial resolution due to low number of electrodes (higher number or density of electrodes requires more power, leading to damage of neural tissue by heat), and hence able to improve vision with low spatial resolution. [0008] Currently, the use of optogenetic sensitization of retinal cells combined with activation/inhibition has allowed the possibility of replacing retinal implants, and eliminating the requirement of placing electrodes near every single neuron for high resolution. Optogenetic stimulation provides high temporal precision by introducing light-activatable molecular channels (e.g. channelrhodopsin-2, ChR2; halorhodopsin, NpHR) into cells by genetic targeting. In addition to higher temporal and spatial resolution, optogenetics has several advantages over electrical stimulation such as cellular specificity (e.g. spared cones, ganglion or bipolar cells) and minimal invasiveness. [0009] Light-induced activation of ChR2, a non-selective cation channel, results in depolarization of only those cells that express ChR2. Selective activation of neurons by ms- pulsed blue light has been demonstrated in culture, brain slices, as well as in small animals. This optogenetic activation method is very promising as it only requires light of low intensity (~ 100 W/m2) that can be delivered from a light emitting diode (LED) or laser. Such light sources have been used for vision restoration in a blind mouse model either by non-specific stimulation of retina or in a promoter-specific manner including Thyl for retinal ganglion cells, and mGluR6 targeting ON bipolar cells. Further, use of such active light stimulation of chloride-channel opsin (Halorhodopsin) expressing in longer-persisting cone photoreceptors protein has shown new promise for therapeutic intervention for restoration of vision. The re-sensitized photoreceptors have been shown to drive retinal circuitry functions, activate cortical circuits, and mediate visually guided behaviors. [0010] However, clinical translation of such optogenetic activation for vision restoration suffers from two major drawbacks. First, due to narrow spectral sensitivity, the light levels needed to activate the opsins (as currently bio-engineered) (blue laser or LED) are at least an order of magnitude higher than the highest ambient light levels (~10 W/m2) likely to ever be encountered by a human. Boosting up light intensity to high enough levels to activate narrowband opsin-expressing cells, especially for chronic stimulation, may substantially damage the residual light-sensing function that might exist in the diseased or impaired retina. Another substantial barrier to the clinical translation of optogenetic methods is delivery of opsin-encoding genes into spatially-targeted regions of degenerated-retina (e.g. periphery in RP and macula for AMD). [0011] Therefore, there is a need for development of broad-band spectrally-sensitive opsins and spatially-targeted delivery methods (unlike viral methods) to allow expression of the opsins in areas of retinal degeneration, allowing for effective vision restoration. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0012] In order to allow an ambient- light based stimulation paradigm, the inventor has created a white-opsin construct that has broad spectral excitability in the entire visible spectrum (400-650 nm). This allows higher sensitivity of white-opsin sensitized higher-order neurons in degenerated retina to ambient white light, and therefore, significantly lowers activation-threshold in contrast to a conventional approach of narrow-band, intense, blue-light based active- stimulation. Data on cells sensitized with white-opsin shows about twelve times higher excitability with white light with blue, green, and red components as compared to that using only the blue light component. [0013] In one aspect, the presently disclosed invention provides an opsin fusion protein that is responsive to broad visible light excitation having a bandwidth of about 300 nm. In one exemplary embodiment, the broad visible light includes the spectrum between about 400 and about 650 nm. [0014] In another aspect, the disclosed invention is an opsin construct that is a plasmid expression vector comprising genes encoding for one or more opsin proteins excitable by broad visible light having a bandwidth of about 300 nm. In one embodiment, the opsin construct encodes ChR2, C1V1, and ReaChR opsins, or fragments thereof. [0015] Further embodiments include the use of an opsin construct for restoration of vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. [0016] In another aspect, the presently disclosed invention provides a method of restoring vision in a patient suffering from a retinal disorder. The method includes delivering to the eye a vector construct that has genes encoding for one or more opsins that altogether are responsive to broad spectrum visible light having a bandwidth of about 300 nm, and stimulating the eye with white light. In one embodiment, the white light is ambient white light. In one embodiment the vector construct has genes encoding for three opsins, ChR2, C1V1, and ReaChR, or fragments thereof. [0017] Furthermore, the invention disclosed herein includes an ultrafast, near-infrared laser method for delivering therapeutic molecules, wherein the laser emission is between about 700 and about 1300 nm. In one embodiment, the laser is a femtosecond (fs) laser. Using the fs laser, the inventor has demonstrated non- viral transfection that provides spatially-targeted expression of opsin(s) in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layers. This laser-transfection is capable of delivering large sized (for example 10.5-10.6 kb) white-opsin vector constructs, unlike viral methods wherein delivery of such large sized molecules is problematic. The application of spatially-targeted laser transfection of white-opsins in degenerated retina will allow stimulation of RGCs by ambient light, leading to vision restoration in RP/AMD (retinitis pigmentosa/age- related macular degeneration) patients. [0018] Details associated with the embodiments described above and others are described below.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0032] The present disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. [0033] The terms "a" and "an" are defined as one or more unless this disclosure explicitly requires otherwise. The term "substantially" is defined as largely but not necessarily wholly what is specified (and includes what is specified; e.g., substantially 90 degrees includes 90 degrees and substantially parallel includes parallel), as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art. In any disclosed embodiment, the terms "substantially," "approximately," and "about" may be substituted with "within [a percentage] of what is specified, where the percentage includes .1, 1, 5, and 10 percent. [0034] Further, a device or system that is configured in a certain way is configured in at least that way, but it can also be configured in other ways than those specifically described. [0035] The terms "comprise" (and any form of comprise, such as "comprises" and "comprising"), "have" (and any form of have, such as "has" and "having"), "include" (and any form of include, such as "includes" and "including") and "contain" (and any form of contain, such as "contains" and "containing") are open-ended linking verbs. As a result, an apparatus that "comprises," "has," "includes" or "contains" one or more elements possesses those one or more elements, but is not limited to possessing only those elements. Likewise, a method that "comprises," "has," "includes" or "contains" one or more steps possesses those one or more steps, but is not limited to possessing only those one or more steps. [0036] Any embodiment of any of the apparatuses, systems, and methods can consist of or consist essentially of- rather than comprise/include/contain/have - any of the described steps, elements, and/or features. Thus, in any of the claims, the term "consisting of or "consisting essentially of can be substituted for any of the open-ended linking verbs recited above, in order to change the scope of a given claim from what it would otherwise be using the open-ended linking verb. [0037] The feature or features of one embodiment may be applied to other embodiments, even though not described or illustrated, unless expressly prohibited by this disclosure or the nature of the embodiments. [0038] The present invention provides a new clinical approach for treating patients with retinal-degeneration by first determining the degenerated areas, followed by intra-vitreous injection of wide-spectrally activatable white-opsin constructs and near-infrared ultrafast laser- assisted targeted, non- viral delivery of the constructs to degenerated areas in an efficient and minimally-invasive manner. Such treatment will lead to restoration of high-resolution vision by white-light stimulation of white-opsin sensitized retinal ganglion cells at ambient light level. This will eliminate the requirement of prosthetic devices (e.g. camera based LED/ microelectrode-array providing active, and patterned illumination to the retina) for restoration of vision and will lead to higher visual resolution. [0039] White-opsin: Some approaches for optogenetic restoration of vision have employed either ChR2 or NpHR opsin, both of which have narrow spectral excitation bands (e.g. blue excitation for ChR2 and yellow inhibition for NpHR). None of these opsins are sensitive to broad ambient white light with bandwidth of about 300 nm and therefore, efficiency in converting white light to intra-cellular current (for modulating neuronal activity) is low. Thus, all attempts for restoring vision by optogenetic stimulation so far have been focusing on the development and implementation of an active array of intense narrow-band light sources (e.g. LED array to activate opsin-sensitized cells in retina). However, there exist considerable concerns about the viability of opsin-sensitized neurons as well as residual photo-sensitive cells under extended exposure to such intense blue light. [0040] The present invention provides, in one aspect, an opsin fusion protein that is responsive to broad visible light having a bandwidth of about 300 nm. This protein is referred to herein as "white-opsin". In one embodiment, the broad visible light includes the light spectrum between about 400 and about 650 nm. In another embodiment, the opsin fusion protein comprises multiple opsin components that are each responsive to a narrow bandwidth of visible light excitation that is less than about 300nm, and wherein the multiple opsin components have different visible light responsiveness from each other. That is, the narrow bandwidths of the opsin components are narrow in that they are less than about 300 nm, wherein 300 nm is conventionally considered to include the bandwidth of the entire visible light spectrum, or substantially the entire visible light spectrum. [0041] In some embodiments, the bandwidths of the visible light responsiveness of the multiple opsin components herein described are between about 80 to about 120 nm. Furthermore, the bandwidths of any or all of the multiple opsin components may overlap. For example, a first opsin component may have a bandwidth of visible light responsiveness of 400 to 520 nm, and another opsin component may have a bandwidth of visible light responsiveness of 500 to 580, thus overlapping the bandwidth of the first opsin component. [0042] In one exemplary embodiment of the disclosed invention, the multiple opsin components are ChR2, C1V1, and ReaChR, or fragments thereof. In brief, ChR2, C1V1, and ReaChR are naturally occurring or human engineered opsin variants. ChR2 is channelrhodopsin- 2 from algae, CI VI is an engineered chimeric opsin variant composed of ChRl (channelrhodopsin-1) and VChRl (a cation-conducting channel rhodopsin) fragments, and ReaChR is a red light activatable, engineered variant of a channelrhodopsin. In one embodiment, ChR2, ClVl, and ReaChR, or fragments thereof are in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio. As will be understood by one skilled in the art, the multiple opsin components that make up the opsin fusion protein (e.g., ChR2, ClVl, and ReaChR) need not be represented in their entirety, as long as the fragments thereof that make up the fusion protein give rise to responsivity in the desired portion of the visible light spectrum. [0043] According to one embodiment of the invention, an opsin fusion protein with broad spectrum visible light responsivity is made by site specific recombination cloning. In one embodiment, the white -opsin fusion protein, is made by fusion of the genes encoding for ChR2, ClVl, and ReaChR, or fragments thereof. By combining three different opsin constructs (ChR2 for blue light activation, 400-520 nm; ClVl for green light activation 500-580 nm; and ReaChR for red light activation, 550-630 nm; FIG. 1 A and FIG IB.), the approach is to deliver the macro- construct (size about 10.5 - 10.6 kb) encoding white-opsin so as to sensitize specific types of retinal cells to white light (FIG. 1C). [0044] FIG. 2 shows a gel electrophoresis image of a white-opsin construct made using gateway cloning. Expression of all three opsins, sensitive to light in three distinct spectral bands in retinal cells, led to addition of intra-cellular currents evoked by different light-bands. This enhanced the white light-sensitivity of white-opsin expressing cells by 12-times (FIGS. 5 A and 5B), significantly reducing the required light intensity for generating action potential and thus minimizing light-induced chronic damage to the opsin-expressing cells as well as residual light- sensing cells that might exist in the diseased or impaired retina. Lowering the white light- activation threshold paves the way for stimulation by natural ambient light conditions. [0045] In one embodiment of the disclosed invention, expression of an opsin fusion protein in retinal cells causes increased responsivity of the retinal cells to ambient white light. Furthermore, in another embodiment, an opsin fusion protein responsive to broad visible light excitation has on and off visible light excitation time constraints on the order of milliseconds. The on and off visible light excitation time constraint is a measure of the speed of responsivity of which is physiologically relevant for retinal function. In comparison to white-opsin which has on and off-rates on the order of milliseconds, some other opsins, such as step-function opsins (SFO's) and stable-SFO's have undesirable off-time constraints on the order of tens of seconds and even several minutes. [0046] Another aspect of the presently disclosed invention is an opsin construct that is a plasmid expression vector. In one embodiment, the opsin construct includes genes encoding for ChR2, C1V1, and ReaChR opsins, or fragments thereof. In a further embodiment, the opsin construct has a size of about 10 kb. In some cases, the size of the opsin construct may have a size of less than about 10.5 kb to about 10.6 kb and still express a protein having the same or similar light responsivity as the larger size construct. In other exemplary embodiments, the ChR2, C1V1, and ReaChR opsin construct encodes an opsin protein that is excitable by broad spectrum visible light. The broad spectrum visible light has a bandwidth of about 300 nm, and, in a further case, includes the light spectrum between about 400 and about 650 nm. Other ranges of visible light responsivity may also be targeted for construction of other opsin constructs based on the invention herein disclosed. For example, consideration of the responsiveness of the human eye to certain visible light wavelength regions, such as between about 390 nm to about 700 nm, could prompt the construction of opsin constructs encoding opsins responding to the 390 to 700 nm region. Responsivity to narrower visible light regions may also be of therapeutic value in some situations. It may be beneficial in some cases to take into consideration deficiencies in the eye's responsiveness to certain other regions of the visible light spectrum, or even near visible light spectrum, when engineering a particular opsin construct. Specifically, the invention disclosed herein includes embodiments for the use of an opsin construct for restoration of vision loss. In some embodiments, the vision loss may be due to age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. [0047] Delivery of large molecules: One challenge to be overcome to implement the above described innovative approach is the delivery of such a large white -opsin construct into retinal cells. Delivery of such large constructs (larger than about 10 kb) is not possible by the currently available safe viral methods. Although it may be possible that three different viral vectors can separately deliver three different plasmids encoding for the three spectral component opsins, the stoichiometric expression of the three components, such as in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio in each cell, cannot be guaranteed. Further, application of multiple viral vectors can lead to immune reaction and may cause unwanted transfection of non-targeted tissue. [0048] Though several non-viral approaches such as electroporation and lipofection exist, these methods suffer from low transfection efficiency and loss of cell viability. We have demonstrated ultrafast near-infrared laser-mediated optical-delivery of large molecules (e.g. anti- mitochondrial antibody tagged with Alexa 488; size >150 kDa) into mammalian cells with high (> 80%) efficiency with single cell resolution (3). Similarly, others too have demonstrated targeted laser transfection. Using a similar method, the white -opsin macro-constructs are delivered into retinal cells with high efficiency in a minimally-invasive manner. In a broader sense, non- viral optical-delivery of large, impermeable molecules in an efficient and nondestructive manner allows transformation and/ or visualization of cellular structure and function. [0049] For purposes of delivering the opsin constructs as described herein, the present invention includes a laser based method for spatially directed delivery of therapeutic molecules to the eye using an ultrafast near-infrared laser. In a further embodiment, the near-infrared laser is a femtosecond laser. Ultra-fast near-infrared lasers may be used in particular for the spatial directed delivery of the opsin constructs as described herein for treatment of age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. In one embodiment of the invention, an opsin construct of the genes encoding for ChR2, C1V1, and ReacChR may be delivered into retinal cells by lipofection or by laser transfection. In a further embodiment, the delivery of the construct by laser transfection is accomplished using an ultrafast, near infrared laser with emission between about 700 nm and about 1300 nm. [0050] Spatially-targeted gene expression: Patient-to-patient variability and time- dependent changes in the spatial distribution of retinal degeneration demands site-specific expression of white-opsin. For example, spatially-targeted delivery of opsin-encoding gene(s) is required in peripheral retina or macula, which begin to lose light sensitivity due to loss of photoreceptors in case of RP and AMD respectively. [0051] With a viral or non- viral (e.g. electroporation, lipofection) method, the constructs will be delivered everywhere, causing uncontrolled expression over the whole retina. This will cause complications in functioning of non-degenerated areas of retina by interference of light- evoked potential in multiple layers of the retinal circuitry. Therefore, application of spatially- targeted laser transfection of wide-band opsins in degenerated retina allows efficient stimulation of retinal ganglion cells in areas of photoreceptor-degeneration by ambient light, leading to visual restoration. [0052] The present invention is easily adapted to current clinical practice (FIGS. 3A-3B): (i) Intravitreal injection of white-opsin encoding plasmids; (ii) Near-infrared ultrafast laser-based non-contact creation of highly- localized, transient pores on outer retinal ganglion cell membrane in degenerated areas; (iii) Reasonable delivery time of ~45 minutes for an area containing 500,000 cells (5 ms / cell). Further, in case of loss of opsin-expression or degeneration of new retinal area(s), the whole process can be easily repeated. [0053] The development of white-opsins enables efficient utilization of the wide-spectral band of ambient white light in stimulating targeted higher-order neurons in degenerated retinal circuitry. The near-infrared optoporation method not only eliminates the requirement of multiple viral delivery and related immunogenic reactions, it also is able to deliver wide-spectrally sensitive opsin encoding macro-constructs to spatially-targeted degenerated retina areas, thus paving the way for translation of the technology to clinical trials. In one aspect of the presently disclosed invention, a method for restoring vision in a patient suffering from a retinal disorder is provided that includes the steps of delivering to the eye of a patient a vector construct comprising genes encoding for one or more opsins that altogether are responsive to broad spectrum visible light having a bandwidth of about 300 nm, and stimulating the eye with white light, wherein the white light may be ambient white light in one embodiment. In one more specific embodiment, the retinal disorder is age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. In one embodiment, the vector construct comprises the genes encoding for ChR2, ClVl, and ReaCh opsins, or fragments thereof. In a further embodiment, the vector construct is delivered using an ultrafast near-infrared laser. In a still further embodiment, the construct is initially delivered to the eye by intravitreal injection. [0054] Below, the presently disclosed invention will be further described by way of examples, which are provided for illustrative purposes only and accordingly are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. [0055] EXAMPLES [0056] Example 1 - Construction of White-Opsin for Broad-Band Light Activation [0057] 1.1 Materials and Methods [0058] A. Construction of white-opsin. Using MultiSite Gateway® Technology [5], fusion of multiple opsin-encoding genes (ChR2, ClVl, ReaChR) along with CMV promoter was carried out to achieve broad-band white-opsin (FIG. 2 and FIGS. 9A-9B). The Gateway Technology is a universal cloning method based on the bacteriophage lambda site-specific recombination system which facilitates the integration of lambda into the E. coli chromosome and the switch between the lytic and lysogenic pathways [6]. In this technology, the components of the bacteriophage lambda recombination system are modified to improve the specificity and efficiency of the system [7], providing a rapid and highly efficient way to transfer heterologous DNA sequences into multiple vector systems for protein expression [2]. In the 4-Fragment recombination reaction, four PCR products (5 ' element, gene of interest, and 3 ' element) flanked by specific attB or attBr sites and four donor vectors are used in separate BP recombination reactions to generate four entry clones. The four entry clones and the destination vector, pDEST™ R4-R3 Vector II are used together in a LR recombination reaction to create the white- opsin expression clone. The stop codons from ChR2-YFP and C1V1-YFP have been removed to create the fusion-construct of white-opsin. In this fusion-protein, the expression for the white- opsin components (i.e., ChR2, C1V1, ReaChR) are in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio, which was confirmed experimentally by tuning the activation wavelength and measuring the inward photocurrent. [0059] B. Cell culture and opsin transfection. 10,000 HEK293 cells (ATCC) / 35 mm petri dish were cultured and maintained in DMEM/F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, and 200 U/mL penicillin. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. 48 hours after plating, cells were transfected with CMV-ChR2-YFP or CMV-white-opsin-Citrine construct (1 μg/ml), using lipofectamine (Life Technologies). After 24 hours transfection, fluorescence of the reporter proteins (Citrine, YFP) was visualized under suitable illumination to identify the transgene expressing cells for patch clamp electrophysiology. For generating light activation, cells were loaded with all-trans retinal (ATR, 1 μΜ) for at least 6 hours before conducting the experiments. HEK293 cells without opsin expression were considered as negative control (N=8 cells from 3 batches). [0060] 1.2 Results [0061] FIG. 6 A shows the normalized activation spectra of three narrow-band opsins (ChR2, C1V1, and ReaChR). Further, even light having lower narrow-bands (FIG. 6A) are typically used for activation of these opsins. Construction of a white-opsin having a broadband activation spectrum (uppermost profile) should allow effective stimulation by white light. A plasmid map of such as broad-band activatable white-opsin is shown in FIG. 6B, made by fusion of three genes encoding for opsins: ChR2 for blue light sensitivity, CI VI for green light sensitivity, and ReaChR for red light sensitivity. MultiSite Gateway® Technology [2] was used which employs site-specific recombinational cloning to allow simultaneous cloning of multiple DNA fragments in a defined order. Table 1 shows the forward and reverse primer sequences designed to create attB sites for genes of interest, each containing a kozak sequence for mRNA translation followed by the specified gene. In FIG. 7 is shown the maps of opsin plasmids cloned via PCR to create attB sites for the final "white-opsin" expression vector containing ChR2-YFP, ClVl-YFP, ReaChR-Citrine, and CMV promoter sequence. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the white-opsin construct (digested by restriction enzyme BamHI with restriction fragments: 4.6, 2.5, 2.2 and 1.2 kb) is shown in FIG. 2.

[0063] Example 2 - Quantitative comparison between non- viral gene delivery by lipofection and laser assisted transfection. [0064] A. Transfection of single and multiple opsin(s) using lipofection. In order to evaluate transfection of plasmids encoding single or multiple opsin(s) to mammalian cells by lipofection, molecular engineering of single and multiple opsins (fusion of ChR2, C1V1, ReaChR) was carried out. FIGS. 7A- 7C show vector maps of ChR2 (7 A), CIVI (7B), ReachR (7C), and white -opsin (7D). The corresponding gel electrophoresis images of each opsin are shown in FIG. 8. HEK 293 cells were transfected by lipofectamine having plasmids at final concentration of 1 μg/ml, which is calibrated from the absorption spectrum of cloned ChR2- YFP, ReaChR-Citrine and White-opsin-Citrine (FIG 9A-9C). Quantification of lipofectamine based transfection of different opsins was done, and in order to quantify expression in plasma membrane and intracellular components, lines were drawn across representative cells and fluorescence intensity profiles of opsin-reporter protein (YFP) along the lines were plotted. Regardless of types of opsins, cellular morphology was observed to be compromised from the flat to spherical shape. This resulted in higher intracellular fluorescence leading to no distinct peaks (across membrane). -Therefore, no statistical significance between membrane and intracellular expression was observed. [0065] B. Targeted laser assisted transfection of single opsins. To achieve targeted transfection of cells with opsin encoding plasmids (ChR2 and ReachR), we used optimized laser parameters 69 for optoporation into HEK293 cells. Before optoporation, extracellular media was changed with new DMEM media containing plasmids DNA (ReaChR or ChR2) with final concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated for 30 minutes. FIG. 10 shows the setup for targeted ultrafast laser-assisted opsin-delivery. The focused laser spot, whose intensity distribution in XZ plane in the focal volume was simulated (wavelength: 850 nm, focused by NA =1.4 objective). Using this localized focal volume, spatially-targeted cells can be selectively optoporated. Using targeted femtosecond laser assisted transfection of single opsins in HEK293 cells, representative fluorescence image of targeted ChR2-YFP optoporated HEK cells was overlaid on bright field image. The representative fluorescence image of laser-targeted ReaChR-Citrine transfected HEK293 cells was similarly overlaid. Unlike lipofectamine based transfection, cellular morphology after laser transfection was found to remain flat. Fluorescence intensity profiles of opsin-reporter proteins (YFP, Citrine) along the lines drawn across representative cells (FIG. 11 A, 1 IB) showed distinct peak at plasma membranes implying localized expression of ChR2 and ReaChR on plasma membrane (FIGS. 11C, 11D). [0066] C. Laser assisted transfection of White-opsin: functional evaluation using broadband light. FIGS. 12A-D show targeted laser assisted transfection of White-opsin (fusion of multiple opsins) into HEK293 cells and broadband (white) light based optogenetic stimulation. Similar to ChR2 and ReaChR-optoporated cells, the White-opsin delivered by the femtosecond laser was found to be expressing on plasma membrane. FIG. 12A shows representative fluorescence intensity profiles of reporter proteins along lines drawn across. Quantitative comparison of expression on membrane and intracellular components in cells optoporated with White-opsin is shown in FIG. 12B. To evaluate the functional activation of White-opsin, broadband stimulation of White-opsin expressing cells were carried out using patch clamp electrophysiology. Representative inward photocurrent in response to white-light optogenetic stimulation (0.12 mW/mm2) at two different pulse widths are shown in FIG. 12C, suggesting that low intensity broadband light can be used for generation of robust photocurrent in a spatially-targeted manner with high temporal resolution. [0067] D. Quantitative comparison between two non-viral gene delivery methods. FIG. 12D summarizes the quantitative comparison between opsin expression distributions (ratio of membrane to intracellular) as a result of two non- viral gene delivery methods: optoporation and lipofection. Higher membrane to intracellular ratio of expression in optoporated cells as compared to lipofection can be attributed to the spread morphology of opsin-expressing cells in case of optoporation as compared to those transfected by lipofection (which tend to become spherical). [0068] One milestone objective for the present invention is to demonstrate behavioral restoration of vision in a mouse model of RP with ambient-level white-light stimulation of retinal ganglion cells, sensitized with white-opsin by targeted transfection using near-infrared ultrafast laser beam. In order to achieve this, one aim is to characterize and deliver a white-opsin, sensitive to wide-spectral band of light by an ultrafast laser beam to spatially-targeted regions of degenerated retina. An additional aim is the evaluation of the long-term retention of white-opsin, and the viability of white-opsin expressing RGCs after chronic light stimulation. The effectiveness and functioning of the white-opsin sensitized degenerated retina can be confirmed by measurement of visual evoked potential in a blind mouse model. Another aim is to carry out different in-depth behavioral assessments to confirm restoration of vision in white-opsin sensitized degenerated-retina of a blind mouse models in ambient light. [0069] Tasks for the characterization of wide-wavelength band activatable white-opsin include (1) optoporation of white-opsin encoding genes to retinal ganglion cells in-vitro, and (2) non-viral in vivo optical delivery of plasmids encoding white-opsin into spatially-targeted regions of photo-degenerated retina of animal models. [0070] In order to avoid existing concerns regarding the use of viruses, and the eye being accessible to external delivery methods, non-viral optical delivery method is presented for efficient expression of ChR2 in retina. The scanning near IR laser microbeam was used for in vitro delivery of ChR2 to localized areas of retina (3). Such spatial delivery of genes to peripheral retina/macula is ideal for sensitizing degenerated-retinal areas, thus paving the way for restoring lost- vision of RP/AMD patients. [0071] Optoporation of ChR2 gene into targeted area of retina: Recently, there is considerable interest in optically transfecting cells using ultrafast pulsed light (4) because of its selective targeting capability and higher efficiency and viability (>90% reported in vitro (4) as compared to other methods. Further, femtosecond (fs) near-infrared laser based transfection has been shown to be safe, providing high efficiency and survival (93%) of optoporated embryo during development, as well as for in vivo gene delivery as opposed to electroporation. We have demonstrated (3) the use of ultrafast NIR laser microbeam for spatially-localized transfection of retina with ChR2-YFP-plasmids. For transfection of a specific area of the retina (as opposed to electroporation over the whole retina), an ultrafast (-200 fs) laser beam (800 nm, 76 MHz) was expanded, and focused using a 20X microscope objective under the upright microscope. The XY-scanning of the region of interest by the fs laser beam was achieved by controlling the galvanometric mirror through in-house developed software on a Lab View platform. The power of the laser microbeam, exposure (by an electro-mechanical shutter) at each focused spot and number of focused spots in the region of interest was varied in order to optimize transfection. Retinal cells in different geometrically-shaped (e.g. triangle, annular) regions were transfected, ex vivo, using the scanning fs laser beam. Expression of YFP in targeted cells was confirmed by YFP-immunostaining. In summary, optoporation of ChR2 gene into targeted spatial location of retina is achievable with ultrafast laser microbeam, which paves the way for re-sensitizing degenerated retina towards light. [0072] For evaluating the enhanced light-sensitivity of white-opsin as compared to narrow-band opsins, HEK cells were separately transfected with four different constructs: (i) ChR2-YFP; (ii) C1V1-YFP; (iii) ReaChR-YFP, or (iv) White-opsin (ChR2-ClVl-ReaCh-YFP). These four different types of opsin-expressing cells were exposed to pulses (e.g. 50 ms) of light (broad band or tunable narrow-band) with incident intensity ranging from 1 to 100 W/m2 (ambient level is ~ 10 W/m2) and the variation of the inward current responses were measured by patch clamp. FIG. 4 shows the variation of inward current in white-opsin expressing HEK cells as a function of white-light intensities. Further, wavelength dependent patch-clamp recordings were carried out to measure the response of these four opsins to individual narrow band (5 nm) as well as wide-spectral (400-650 nm) activation. For achieving tunable excitation at high resolution (5 nm), a high power lamp with liquid crystal tunable filter was used. FIG. 5A shows a histogram of current responses of white-opsin sensitized HEK cells stimulated by different components of white light (total white light intensity: 6.0 x 10-5 White light was found to evoke about 12 times more number of inward current profiles (between 500-1000 pA) as compared to that by the blue light (FIG. 5B) for a total of 70 light pulses (10 ms pulse width). To determine the threshold for action potential generation and compare sensitivity towards ambient white light, the white-light intensity from the activation source was varied and the response of the four different opsin-sensitized cells was measured. [0073] To optimize the efficiency of the laser based delivery of macro-construct (Thyl- ChR2-ClVl-ReaCh-YFP, 10.5 kb, FIG. 2) encoding white-opsin into retinal ganglion cells, retinas from adult rdl mice were collected and placed in microscopic incubator-chambers. Ultrafast laser-based transfection of the macro-constructs can be carried out in targeted regions (as described for FIGS. 3A-3B). The expression of white-opsin reporter protein (YFP) in retinal ganglion layer was monitored after laser transfection for a period of time such as two days. Laser beam parameters (average power, exposure at each focused spot, and number of focused spots /mm2 in the region of interest) were varied to optimize transfection efficiency (number of YFP+ cells/ mm2) and minimize cellular damage (evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis). [0074] In vivo optoporation experiments for delivery of the white-opsin plasmids to the retinal ganglion cell layer of the rdl mouse model (6 weeks-old) and optimization of the delivery efficiency based on feedback from reporter fluorescence expression analysis is another aspect of the studies that may be done to further illustrate the invention. The rdl mouse homologous animal model for RP (inherited retinal degeneration) is characterized by an early, rapid loss of photoreceptors (with almost no rods after 4 weeks). The experiments will include intra vitreal injection (e.g. Ιμΐ) of a solution of white-opsin plasmid that is under control of a specific promoter (Thyl), targeted for retinal ganglion cells of rdl mice (a statistical group may include, for example, N=30 mice; N=10 for optoporation, N=10 for PBS injection with optoporation as a surgical control, and N= 10 for no optoporation control). In an exemplary experimental plan for optoporation, two laser intensities and two scanning rates will be varied. The optoporation system (FIG. 3A) consists of an existing scanning ultrafast near infrared laser microbeam focused onto targeted spatial location of the degenerated retina. To optimize the laser transfection efficiency and minimize animal-to-animal variation, the retina of each eye may be divided into four quadrants, wherein each quadrant will receive a different laser intensity (but the same pulse width), tuned around optimized delivery intensity as determined by in vitro experiments. It may be noted that to match the required intensity at the retina, the laser power at the cornea may be calibrated considering the light propagation through the focusing elements of the eye (as calculated by Zemax simulations). [0075] Following transfection, for instance 1 week after transfection, the mouse eye may be first examined in vivo for YFP-expression using an upright confocal microscope. If the gene expression level is found to be inadequate, the animal may be recovered from anesthesia, returned to the vivarium and the procedure attempted some time (for example 7 days) later. As a measurement of the success of transfection, the number density of cells expressing YFP and the expression level (fluorescence intensity) of these cells may be quantified. In addition, cell viability in four quadrants of the laser-transfected retina may be compared with that of the control using apoptotic immunohistochemistry markers. For statistical purposes, the experiments should utilize at least a minimum of animals so as to establish a difference between experimental and control groups. [0076] For treatment of retinal degeneration diseases (e.g. RP, AMD, etc.) using the optogenetic sensitization approach, it is essential to achieve long-term expression of white-opsin in targeted retinal regions. In addition to long-term retention of white-opsin, the success of this treatment modality will depend on the viability of the white-opsin expressing RGCs after chronic exposure to ambient light. To demonstrate success in regard to this aim, evaluation of the long- term retention and viability of retinal cells after chronic light stimulation in RP mice model may be undertaken. Further, restoration of vision by optogenetic stimulation requires the transmission of light-activated potential from the retinal ganglion cells to the visual cortex. The effectiveness and functioning of the white-opsin sensitized degenerated retina may be confirmed by measurement of the visual evoked potential (VEP) in the primary visual cortex of the mouse model using multi-electrode array (MEA), at different light intensities, wavelengths and patterns. [0077] Long-term white-opsin expression: Following in vivo laser transfection of white- opsin into rdl mouse retina as described herein, the long-term (up to 12 months) expression of the white-opsin may be examined periodically (e.g. every 2 weeks) by in vivo confocal imaging (N=12 animals). Determination of the density of cells expressing YFP (reporter for white-opsin) as well as the expression level (fluorescence intensity) of transfected retina may be determined in order to evaluate the long-term retention of the white-opsin. For example, YFP-expression in the laser-transfected retinal area may be quantified every 2 weeks, and retention of YFP-expression may be evaluated by quantitative comparison at different time points. [0078] Reinduction of white-opsin expression in case of loss of expression: For the case where loss of white-opsin expression occurs in the long-term after laser-transfection in clinical trials, it would be necessary to reinduce the expression. This occurrence may be tested by reinjecting white-opsin encoding plasmids into the eye vitreous of the rdl mouse which originally expressed white-opsin for a period of time such as 1 month, but lost the expression (e.g. >60% loss) thereafter. In these mice, laser-transfection into the retina may be carried out again using the optimized laser parameters from earlier studies, with analysis of YFP expression periodically thereafter (e.g. every 2 weeks) to determine whether reinduction of white-opsin can be achieved. [0079] An objective in using the wide spectrally-sensitive opsin and its targeted non-viral delivery is to enable ambient white-light to restore vision which may be demonstrated by behavioral improvement experiments in a mouse RP model. By utilizing the whole spectrum, we expect that ambient-light can stimulate the white-opsin sensitized RGCs to generate action potential. Therefore, vision-restoration may be tested by behavioral scoring in response to bright ambient light (10-50 W/m2). For behavioral testing, besides directional light sensitivity, evaluation of spatial memory and learning, improvement in depth perception and optomotor response are critical assays for restoration of vision in white-opsin sensitized RP mice models. Our studies show that rdl mice, transfected with ChR2 into RGCs, behaviorally responded to bright blue light, but not the mice without transfection.
