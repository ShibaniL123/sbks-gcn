The second step
To a solution of Compound 6 (718 mg, 1.63 mmol) in THF (1.63 mL) was added 1mol / L THF solution of TBAF (2.45 mL, 2.45 mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 6 hours and 38 minutes at 75 Â°C. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of ice water, saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution and 2 mol / L aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and saturated brine successively, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 7 (602mg, yield 83.8%).
