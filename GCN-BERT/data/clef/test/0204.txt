LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES CLAIMED Vitis interspecific hybrid VARIETY DENOMINATION ‘IFG Twenty’ BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The new and distinct grapevine described and claimed herein originated from a hand pollinated cross of the IFG 01032-067-222, an unnamed seedless selection from the IFG breeding program, and the A2798 (unnamed interspecific selection from the University of Arkansas) hybridized in May 2006. The abortive seed traces were subsequently embryo cultured and the resulting population of plants was planted in the field in April 2007. The present variety of grapevine was selected as a single plant in September 2008 and was first asexually propagated by hardwood cuttings in December 2008 near Delano, Kern County, Calif. The resulting propagules were planted during April 2009 near Delano, Kern County, Calif. and were found to reproduce true-to-type through at least two generations of asexual reproduction. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The new grapevine ‘IFG Twenty’ is characterized by producing naturally large seedless blue-black berries having a narrow ellipsoidal to cylindrical shape with a strong fruity labrusca flavor. Fruits normally ripen mid to late season about early to mid-September near Delano Calif. Fruits are fairly low in acidity, with medium dense, firm texture, with occasionally noticeable seed traces. Attachment of the berry to the pedicel is somewhat weak. The variety stores and ships well and is suitable for long-term storage and long distance shipping. Vines are vigorous, very productive and can be pruned to short spurs. The new grapevine differs from its maternal parent the IFG 01032-067-222 by having blue-black rather than light red berries and by having a very strong fruity labrusca type flavor as opposed to the neutral flavor of the IFG 01032-067-222. The berries of ‘IFG Twenty’ are more elongated than the IFG 01032-067-222 and the peduncle is less lignified. ‘IFG Twenty’ can be distinguished from its pollen parent, A2798, by having a more elongated and less firm berry, by having larger berry and cluster size and by having much better resistance to tip cracking of berries when fully ripe as compared to the A2798. Grape breeders have used several native American grape species to improve hardiness, disease and insect resistance as well as incorporate aromatic flavors into the vinifera species. Previously introduced interspecific varieties have had very limited commercial success due to small fruit size, large seed traces, slip-skin texture or lack of firmness. The new grapevine variety is being introduced because of its unique combination of late ripening, labrusca flavor combined with firm texture, seedlessness, good adhesion of skin and flesh and naturally large berry size. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE The accompanying photographic illustration in FIG. 1 illustrates in full color ‘IFG Twenty’. The photograph was taken outdoors with indirect lighting. The colors are as nearly true as is reasonably possible in a color representation of this type. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Throughout this specification, color names beginning with a small letter signify that the name of that color, as used in common speech, is aptly descriptive. Color names beginning with a capital letter designate values based upon R.H.S. Colour Chart, published by The Royal Horticultural Society, London, England. Throughout this specification subjective description values conform to those set forth by the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute publication ‘Descriptors for Grape’ (vitis spp.) (1983) which was developed in collaboration with the Office International de la Vigne et du Vin (OIV) and the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV).
