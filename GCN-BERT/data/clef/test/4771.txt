Example 52 : Preparation of 2'-amino-6-(2-amino-6-(dimethylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-[2,4'-bipyridin]-5-ol
Example 52-1 : Preparation of 6-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-N4,N4-dimethylpyrimidin-2,4-diamine (LXXIV)
2-Amino-6-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)pyrimidin-4(1H)-one (400.0 mg, 1.35 mmol) obtained in Example 51-2 was dissolved in acetonitrile (136.5 mL). To the resulting solution were added dropwise (benzotriazole-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) (774.09 mg, 1.75 mmol) and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (DBU) (604.1 ÂµL, 4.04 mmol) and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 10 min. Dimethylamine hydrochloride (164.69 mg, 2.02 mmol) was added dropwise to the solution and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 hrs. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate, diluted with ethylacetate, and washed with distilled water. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol = 15/1) to give the title compound (436 mg, 99 %).
