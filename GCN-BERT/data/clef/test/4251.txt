Step 2:
benzyl 3-oxopiperazine-1-carboxylate
At 0°C, to a mixture solution of sodium carbonate (24.77 g, 233.73 mmol, 3.00 equivalents) and piperazine-2-one (7.80 g, 77.91 mmol, 1.00 equivalent) in ethyl acetate (70.00 mL) and water (70.00 mL) was added benzyl chloroformate (16.79 g, 93.49 mmol, 13.99 mL, 95% purity, 1.20 equivalents). The reaction mixture was stirred at 30°C for 16 hours. TLC showed completiton of the reaction. The mixture was subjected to extraction using ethyl acetate (80 mL×3). The combined organic layers was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride (80 mL×3), dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to give a crude product. The crude product was beaten in (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 20: I, 80 mL). The resulting mixture was stirred at 30°C for 15 minutes and filtered. The solid was dried in vacuo to give the title compound (15.50 g, 66.17 mmol, 84.93% yield) as a white solid.
