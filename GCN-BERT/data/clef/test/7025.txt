Field of the Invention The invention belongs to the field of biotechnology, and in particular relates to a method for isolating and purifying high-purity recombinant human serum albumin (OsrHSA) for clinical application. Background of the Invention Human serum albumin (HSA) is a non-glycosylated single chain protein consisting of 585 amino acids, having a molecular weight of 66.5 kD and an isoelectric point between 4.7-4.9. It is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma, making up about 60% of the total plasma proteins. There is about 40 g of HSA in per liter of human blood. Besides being present in the plasma, HSA is also found in tissues and body secretions, skins and lymph cavities. Under normal physiological conditions of human beings, HSA has an effect of maintaining plasma colloid osmotic pressure, nourishing, accelerating the concrescence of wounds, and as a carrier, participating in transportation of many hydrophobic biological molecules such as hormones, biological active substances and drugs in the blood. Therefore, HSA is an important medical protein that is mainly used clinically for the treatment of hypoproteinemia caused by loss of blood, burn, scald, plastic surgery and brain lesion, as well as for the treatment of liver cirrhosis, hydronephrosis and so on. At present, HSA for clinical use is mainly prepared by extracting and isolating from human plasma. However, this preparation approach has the following disadvantages: on one hand, the source of plasma is insufficient, i.e. the limited blood supply is unable to meet the demands of production of HSA and the relevant preparations thereof; on the other hand, blood itself may potentially be a risk factor, for example, it may contain dangerous infectious pathogens such as hepatitis virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and so on, which causes enormously concerns about the application of HSA extracted from plasma. With the development of modem DNA recombinant and synthesis techniques, the researchers take a profound interest in the production and application of recombinant human serum albumin (OsrHSA). So far, people have tried to use various expression systems for mass production of OsrHSA. For example, prokaryotes such as E. coli (Latta, M. et al., Bio/Technology, 5:1309-1314,(1987)), bacillus subtilis (Saunders, C. W. et al, J. Bacteriol. 169: 2917-2925, (1987)), eukaryotes such as yeasts (WO 00/44772, EP0683233A2, US 5612196) and cultivation of animal cells have been used for the production of OsrHSA. However, such approaches are not suitable for industrial production due to low expression level or high production cost. Chinese patent application No. 201010606635.8 of the present inventors discloses a method for extracting OsrHSA from rice. Based on the method, the present invention further studies the process for removing endotoxin from OsrHSA and improving the protein purity >99.9999%, thereby obtaining this novel technical solution of the present invention. The application No. 201010606635.8 is specifically incorporated herein and is to be used for all purposes consistent with incorporation by reference.

Test group (UE), the particular process was: Column-packing: About 18 mL of UNO Sphere S resin was packed in a BioRad 15/200 mm chromatography column, and then washed with 0.5N NaOH for 30 min to kill the pyrogens;Equilibration: The column was equilibrated with 100 mL of equilibrium buffer (sodium acetate anhydrous 2g/L, 10% (v/v) anhydrous ethanol, pH 4.5 adjusted with acetic acid) at a flow rate of 300cm/h until the pH reached 4.5 and was constant;Sample-loading: The extract solution sample containing rHSA was added with 10% (v/v) anhydrous ethanol, pH was adjusted to 4.5 with acetic acid; 400 mL of the sample was loaded at a flow rate of 300 cm/h, and the content of endotoxin in the sample was 800-1000EU/mL;Re-equilibration: After sample-loading, the chromatography column was re-equilibrated with 60 mL of equilibrium buffer at a flow rate of 300 cm/h;Elution: Elution buffer (anhydrous sodium acetate 2g/L, NaCl 14.6 g/L, pH 5.5 adjusted with acetic acid, prepared with water for injection) was used to elute the target protein, obtaining the fraction containing OsrHSA.Results: As shown in Fig. 3, purity was no obvious difference between UNO Sphere S control group and the alcohol addition group. That is, UNO Sphere S resin chromatography by adding an alcohol can be used for the primary purification.Endotoxin: After the extraction sample was subjected to primary purification on UNO Sphere S resin with alcohol addition, the decrease of the total EU of endotoxin was the same as that of the control group. This demonstrated that the alcohol in the wash buffer cannot enable UNO Sphere S to have stronger endotoxin removal efficiency. This may be relevant to the matrix of UNO Sphere S resin itself, and both Capto-MMC and Bestarose Diamond MMC resins have complex multifunctional ligands and have weak cation exchange and hydrophobic property. [Example 3] Selection of conditions for anion exchange chromatography as intermediate purification 1. Under OsrHSA flow-through conditions (i.e., under the conditions of the conductivity of 40mS/cm and pH 7.0, OsrHSA flowed through instead of binding to the resin, while the impurities bond to the resin, and thus OsrHSA was separated from the impurities). Anion exchange chromatography was performed on Capto-Adhere and Bestarose Diamond MMA. About 40mL of Capto-Adhere resin was packed in an XK16×400mm chromatography column, and the packing height was 20.5cm. The column was equilibrated with about 8 CV of equilibrium buffer (25mM PB, NaCl 23.4g/L, pH7.0) until UV, pH and conductivity reached the baseline. The elution buffer sample obtained from Capto-MMC or Bestarose Diamond MMC chromatography was adjusted to pH 7.0, and 288mL of the sample was loaded at a flow rate of 300cm/h. When the ultraviolet absorption value of flow-through fraction was >20mAU, the target fraction containing OsrHSA was collected. The sample was taken from each 20mL of fraction to monitor the loading capacity and the total amount of the sample when the purity of the flow-through fraction was not obviously changed; the actual loading capacity of each milliliter of Capto-Adhere resin at a flow rate of 300cm/h was calculated. Under the same OsrHSA flow-through conditions as Capto-Adhere, the parallel test was performed on Bestarose Diamond MMA resin to compare the purification effect and loading capacity. Under the OsrHSA flow-through conditions, after the secondary purification with the two anion resins, HPLC purity of the target protein can reach above 98%. As shown in Fig.4, there was no significant difference on purity between the two resins. 2. Anion change chromatography performed on Capto-Adhere resin under OsrHSA-binding conditions OsrHSA-binding conditions mean that the target protein first bond to the resin and part of impurities flowed through the column, and then the target protein was eluted through particular salt and pH, to achieve the effect of separation and purification, and enrichment of target product. The conditions included: the target protein bond to the anion exchange resin under the conditions of the conductivity of 20mS/cm and pH of 7.0-7.5, and then the target protein was eluted under the conditions of the conductivity of 40mS/cm and pH of 7.0-7.2 to remove the impurities and enrich the target protein. About 22 mL of Capto-Adhere resin was packed in a BioRad 15/200 mm chromatographic column, and then the column was equilibrated with 220mL of equilibrium buffer (sodium dihydrogen phosphate 1.0g/L, disodium hydrogen phosphate 5.0 g/L, NaCl 5.0 g/L, pH 7.5-7.6) at a flow rate of 300cm/h until the pH reached 7.5-7.6 and stable. The elution fraction sample from Capto-MMC or Bestarose Diamond MMC chromatography was diluted with water to reach a conductivity of 19-21mS/cm, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH. 150 mL of the sample was loaded at a flow rate of 300cm/h. The column was re-equilibrated with 100mL of equilibrium buffer. The target protein was eluted with the elution buffer (sodium dihydrogen phosphate 1.5g/L, disodium hydrogen phosphate 5.0 g/L, NaCl 23.4 g/L, pH 7.1-7.2) at a flow rate of 300cm/h, collecting the fraction containing OsrHSA. The content of endotoxin in the collected fraction was 100-200EU/mL. Under the same OsrHSA-binding conditions as Capto-Adhere resin, the parallel test was performed on Bestarose Diamond MMA resin to compare the purification effect and loading capacity. Under the OsrHSA-binding conditions, after secondary purification with Capto-Adhere resin or Bestarose Diamond MMA resin, the purity of the target protein could reach above 99.9% (ELISA detection results). Bestarose Diamond MMA resin and Capto-Adhere resin have the same purification efficiency. The electrophoretograms are shown in Fig. 5. 3. Selection of chromatography conditions for anion exchange chromatography performed on Capto-Adhere and Bestarose Diamond MMA By the parallel comparison of two resins of Bestarose Diamond MMA and Capto-Adhere, it was found that under the same conditions, the two resins had the substantially identical purification efficiency and loading capacity on the elution fraction obtained from the secondary purification performed on Capto-MMC or Bestarose Diamond MMC resin, demonstrating that both the two anion exchange chromatography resins can be used for the secondary purification. The loading capacity of the two resins was higher under OsrHSA flow-through conditions than that of OrsHSA-binding conditions. The loading capacity of the former was about 25mg sample/ mL resin, while the loading capacity of the latter was about 20mg sample / mL resin. However, the purification efficiency under OrsHSA-binding conditions was better than that under OsrHSA flow-through conditions. The purity of the former can reach above 99.9%, and the purity of the latter was only 98-99%. Under OrsHSA-binding conditions, the two resins had better endotoxin removal efficiency than flow-through conditions. Under OsrHSA flow-through conditions, most of the endotoxin flowed through the column together with OsrHSA, resulting in a poorer endotoxin removal efficiency. But under OrsHSA-binding conditions, part of free endotoxin flowed through, and another part of endotoxin bond to the resin tightly so that OsrHSA can be selectively eluted, resulting in a better endotoxin removal efficiency. Taking various factors into consideration, it is preferable to use the OrsHSA-binding conditions as the chromatography conditions of the two anion exchange resins, Capto-Adhere and Bestarose Diamond MMA. [Example 4] Selection of Conditions for Hydrophobic Chromatography as Final Purification 1. Hydrophobic chromatography performed on Phenyl Sepharose HP Referring to the method of Chinese patent CN201010606635.8 of the present applicant, about 28mL of Phenyl sepharose HP resin was packed in a 20 XK16/200 mm chromatography column, and the column was equilibrated with 150mL of equilibration buffer (anhydrous acetic acid sodium 2.32g/L, sodium dihydrogen phosphate 2.81g/L, sodium octanoate 2g/L, ammonium sulfate, 66g/L, pH6.5) at a flow rate of 100cm/h. 100mL of the elution fraction containing OsrHSA obtained from Capto-Adhere or Bestarose Diamond MMA chromatography was added with ammonium sulfate to adjust the conductivity to 75mS/cm, and then added with 0.15g of sodium caprylate, and then adjust pH to 6.5 with hydrochloric acid. It was loaded on the column at a flow rate of 100cm/h. The flow-through was collected to obtain the fraction containing OsrHSA. The fraction samples were taken to determine the loading capacity and calculate the actual loading capacity of the sample from secondary purification per millilitre resin. The electrophoretogram is shown in Fig. 6. 2. Hydrophobic chromatography performed on Phenyl Bestarose HP About 24mL of Phenyl Bestarose HP resin was packed in an XK16/200 mm chromatography column. Parallel test was carried out according to the above method mentioned in 1 of this example. The electrophotograms are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Results and analysis: After the fraction sample obtained from secondary purification with Capto-Adhere or Bestarose Diamond MMA was subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography with Phenyl Sepharose HP or Phenyl Bestarose HP, the purity of target protein could reach 99.9999% (by ELISA). The impurity proteins in the rice seed were not detected. The two hydrophobic resins had no significant difference on purity. The endotoxin contents of the fractions containing OsrHSA obtained from hydrophobic interaction chromatography performed on the two resins were less than 0.06EU/mg. The results showed that both Phenyl Sepharose HP and Phenyl Bestarose HP hydrophobic chromatography resin can be used for the final purification of OsrHSA, and can achieve a better purification and endotoxin removal.
