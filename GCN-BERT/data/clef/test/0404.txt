DEFINING HEAD-TILT OR SNIFFING ANGLE FOR AIRWAY PATENCY DURING RESUSCITATION CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61/980,755 filed April 17, 2014 and 61/989,805 filed May 7, 2014, each of which are incorporated by reference herein, in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates generally to neonatal care. More particularly the present invention relates to a system for providing effective resuscitative breaths to a neonate. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Birth asphyxia occurs when a baby doesn't receive enough oxygen before, during or just after birth and is one of the leading causes of child mortality in the developing world, causing approximately 1 million child deaths annually. Low oxygen levels, resultant from birth asphyxia may decrease a baby's heart rate, blood pressure and blood flow out of the heart. This may, in turn, limit the blood flow to organs and tissues, leading to improper cell function or damage. Organs typically affected by lowered oxygen include the brain, heart and blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, lungs and kidneys. Therefore, immediate treatment is essential to promote child health and prevent child mortality. One such treatment, especially common in the developing world, is neonatal resuscitation using a bag-valve-mask to aid the child's respiration, as illustrated in FIG. 1. [0004] Neonatal resuscitation, as it is currently implemented, in the developing world is technically difficult to perform and has a high rate of failure. This treatment requires that the child's airway be open, as one of the leading causes of hypoxia-asphyxia in children is upper airway obstruction. In unconscious, sedated and sleeping children, there is a tendency for airway obstruction due to relaxation of airway tone and glossoptosis. Achieving and maintaining airway patency and providing breathing support are integral components of resuscitation in children. Airway maneuvers that assist with achieving and maintain airway patency during resuscitation are chin-lift and head-tilt. Head-tilt or sniffing maneuver has been described as a certain degree of extension at the atlanto-axial joint, but the actual head- tilt or sniffing angle has not been defined. During resuscitation and procedural sedation in children, flexion or over-extension of the neck at the atlanto-axial joint could potentially compromise the open airway. [0005] It would therefore be advantageous to provide a system for delivering effective neonatal resuscitation that is easy to use, especially for those with Utile to no training, and provides for the correct head-tilt during the sniffing maneuver. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] The foregoing needs are met, to a great extent, by the present invention, wherein in one aspect a device for resuscitation includes an airway mat configured such that a child can rest on the mat. The device includes a raised portion positioned on the mat such that the shoulders of the child rest on the raised portion and the child's head has a tilt of between 101 to 131 degrees. [0007] According to an aspect of the present invention, the device includes an outline of a child on the mat for child placement. The raised portion is formed integrally with the mat. The raised portion is secured to the mat with one selected from a group consisting of an adhesive, snaps, and hook and loop fasteners. The mat is formed from one selected from a group of plastic, fabric, and rubber. The airway mat is foldable for storage. The device can also include a storage box. [0008] According to another aspect of the present invention, a device for resuscitation includes a neck roll that provides a child with a head-tilt at the atlanto-axial joint of 121.9 degrees. The neck roll is formed from one selected from a group consisting of rubber, plastic, fabric, or foam. The device can include a cover. The device can also include an outline to indicate alignment. [0009] In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a method of providing a child with an open airway includes placing the child on a flat surface. The method also includes raising the shoulders of the child with a neck roll. The method further includes tilting the head of the child back with a tilt of 1 1 1 to 133 degrees at the atlanto-axial joint.

Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. The presently disclosed subject matter may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Indeed, many modifications and other embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which the presently disclosed subject matter pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated Drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the presently disclosed subject matter is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. [0015] An embodiment in accordance with the present invention provides a device for delivering neonatal resuscitation. The device includes an airway mat configured to assist the resuscitation provider with opening the child's airway in preparation for the resuscitative breaths. The device increases the likelihood of an open airway with the head tilted at an angle of l21.9 ±11.18 or between approximately 1 11 to 133 degrees for an open airway. The device can take the form of a mat with a raised portion for ensuring the correct head tilt, or alternately, the device can take the form of a neck roll for ensuring the correct head tilt. The device can include an outline for assisting in proper placement of the child on the mat. [0016] FIG. 2 illustrates a system for providing neonatal resuscitation according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 2 the system 10 includes an airway mat 12, on which the child 14 rests. The child 14 is positioned such that her shoulders are propped up and her head is relaxed back to open the airway. A bag-valve mask 16 is positioned on the child's face such that a technician 18 can stand behind or aside the child and deliver rescue breaths, using the bag 20 of the bag- valve mask 16. The airway mat 12 can include an outline for assisting in proper placement of the child. The airway mat 12 can also include a raised portion such that the child's head tilts back with an angle of 121.9 ±11.18 or between approximately 11 1 to 133 degrees degree angle at the atlanto-axial joint. [0017] FIGS. 3a-3b illustrate perspective views of embodiments of the airway mat, according to embodiments of the present invention. FIG. 3a illustrates a basic airway mat 100 according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 3a the basic airway mat 100 includes a flat mat portion 102 and a raised mat portion 104. The flat mat portion 102 is sized to fit a child comfortably and can be formed from plastic sheeting, foam, or another easily sanitizable material, such that the airway mat 100 can be reused. The raised mat portion 104 has a generally triangular shape and is configured such that it raises the child's shoulders so that the child's head can be relaxed back and the child's airway opened to receive breaths. The raised portion is further configured such that the child's head tilts back with a 121.9 ±11.18 or between approximately 1 11 to 133 degree angle at the atlantoaxial joint. The raised portion 104 can be formed from foam or plastic or other suitable material known to one of skill in the art. The raised portion 104 can also be covered in the same plastic used to form the flat mat portion. The mat 102 and raised portion 104 can include an outline 132 of a child in order to aid in proper placement of the child on the mat 100. The mat 100 can be packaged with a plastic box 134 that can be used to store the tools necessary for resuscitation and to allow for the tools to be kept sterile during storage. [0018] FIG. 3b illustrates another embodiment of the airway mat 120 including the flat mat portion 122 and the raised mat portion 124 described above, with respect to FIG. 3 a. The raised mat portion 124 illustrated in FIG. 3b, also includes a valley 126 to accommodate the neck of the child. The raised portion can also be shaped in any other way known to or conceivable by one of skill in the art. Alternately, the raised platform can be adjustable or removable from the airway mat. [0019] FIG. 3 c illustrates a foldable configuration for the airway mat 130. The foldable configuration allows the airway mat 130 to be stored easily when not in use. The raised portion 124 can also be a standalone component for use without the airway mat. The raised portion 124 is further configured to provide the ideal head tilt of 121.9 degrees. Therefore, the angle at the atlanto-axial joint of the child is approximately 121.9 degrees. [0020] When the neonate is placed on the mat, its neck is properly arched to automatically achieve airway patency. This mat allows for consistently raised shoulders and saves the provider the time of rolling a towel. The material is designed to be comfortable yet stiff enough to retain its proper height and angle during resuscitation, unlike the towel. The mat is angled such that it opens the airway for differently sized neonates. The angle needed to establish sniffing position is 121.9 degrees. Lastly, an outline of a neonate is printed onto the mat to help the user identify correct placement. This device is simple and requires little additional training for caregivers. The device consists of a built-in "shoulder roll" to allow the child to be placed and maintained in head-tilt/sniffing position. The mat can fold up into a portable box that stores needed resuscitation tools. [0021] To determine the heretofore unknown optimal angles, head-tilt position for airway patency was determined using MRI studies. A total of 66 neonates and 17 infants who had MRI of head were included for evaluation. The mean head-tilt angle (between occiput- ophisthion-C7 spinous process) was determined as 121.9 ± 11.18 on sagittal MRI images and was associated with an open airway in spontaneously breathing, sedated children. The data was significantly different from mean angle (113.3 ± 21) in children with blocked airway (p=0.023). The data showed consistency in angle measurements for 0-12 months of age and there was no statistical difference due to gestational age or weight. This finding was incorporated into the mat of the present invention to standardize an optimal head position for airway patency during neonatal and infant resuscitation by PHC workers. The device of the present invention is a simple, innovative, and portable airway mat with a built-in "rise" to perform effective resuscitation by PHC workers in developing countries. Incorporation of the mean head-tilt angle (121.9 ± 11.18) for airway patency in the airway mat facilitates airway resuscitation in neonates and infants. [0022] A total of 831 children between 0-12 months of age underwent MRI of head and neck at Johns Hopkins Hospital between January 1984 and December 2013. Of these, 748 subjects were excluded due to either an artificial airway or a distorted airway from malformation. So, a total of 83 children (66 neonates and 17 infants) were included for measurements and analysis. Of these 83 children, 29 had evidence of airway obstruction and 54 had open airway on MRI. Of those with open airway, 43 had evidence of central nervous system depression due to exposure to sedative or underlying disease. The airway diameters (mean ± SD) in spontaneously breathing, sedated children with open airway were 5.9 ± 2.0 mm (AP at palate), 7.4 ± 2.9 mm (AP at dorsum of tongue) and 6.3 mm ± 1.6 (lateral). The mean head-tilt angle (121.90 ± 11.18) associated with open airway in spontaneously breathing, sedated children was significantly different from mean angle of a blocked airway in both flexion (136.88 ± 7.32) and hyper-extended (1 01.73 ± 8.31) positions (p=0.024143). No correlation was determined between mean head-tilt angle and either gestational age or weight of the child. A specific degree or angle of head-tilt is associated with airway patency during resuscitation. The mean head-tilt angle (between occiput-ophisthion-cervical spine) of 121.90 ± 1 1.18 is associated with a patent airway in spontaneously breathing, sedated children between the ages of 0-12 months.
