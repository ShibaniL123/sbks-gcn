Step 3. Preparation of 3-Formyl-2-phenyl-4H-chromen-4-one
3-Hydroxymethyl-2-phenyl-4H-chromen-4-one (22.1g, 87.7mmol) and o-iodo benzoic acid (IBX, 27g, 96.4mmol) were dissolved in 500ml DMSO and reacted at room temperature overnight. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. The reaction solution was poured into a large amount of water to precipitate a white solid. The solid was added to the water, extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and subjected to spin drying to give 15.2g of a yellowish white solid with a yield of 68.7%.
