ARIPIPRAZOLE FORMULATIONS HAVING INCREASED INJECTION SPEEDS Re ted Applications This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/955,976 filed on March 20, 2014, the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Background U.S. Patent Nos. 4,734,416 and 5,006,528 disclose aripiprazole, 7-{4-[4-(2,3- dichlorophenyl)-l-piperazinyl]butoxy}-3,4-dihydro-2(lH)-quinolinone or 7-{4-[4-(2,3- dichlorophenyl)-l-piperazinyl]butoxy}-3,4-dihydro carbostyril, as an atypical antipsychotic agent useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disease, depression, and other CNS disorders. Aripiprazole Aripiprazole is sold under the trade name ABILIFY®. It acts as a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5-HTIA receptor agonist, and is an antagonist of the serotonin 5- HT2A receptor. ABILIFY® is currently administered orally on a once-a-day dosing schedule as ABILIFY® (aripiprazole) Tablets, ABILIFY DISCMELT® (aripiprazole) Orally Disintegrating Tablets, and ABILIFY® (aripiprazole) Oral Solution. Poor and variable patient compliance with a once-a-day dosing schedule of psychiatric drugs has been reported. Efforts have been made to provide drug dosage forms that may increase the compliance of patients and thereby lower the rate of relapse in the treatment of schizophrenia. U.S. Patent Nos. 7,807,680, 8,338,427, and 8,338,428 describe long-acting aripiprazole sterile injectable formulations. Studies on aripiprazole free base injections showed a prolonged pharmacokinetic profile, but there have been reports of moderate to severe tissue irritation following intramuscular (IM) injection and subcutaneous (SC) injection. As such, there exists a need for improved methods of delivering antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole, thereby improving patient compliance and maximizing the pharmacological profile of the active agent. Summary of the Invention In part, the invention provided herein relates to the intramuscular administration of pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of Formula (I) to a subject in need thereof using a rapid injection rate.

The aqueous vehicle of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be a buffer. The buffer may be selected from a phosphate, citrate, tartrate, or acetate buffer. In a particular embodiment, the buffer is a phosphate buffer. The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can further comprise additional components. For example, the pharmaceutical compositions can also contain an aqueous vehicle, which is a vehicle that dilutes and suspends the drug. The vehicle of interest herein is one that is pharmaceutically acceptable (safe and non-toxic for administration to a human) and is useful for the preparation of a reconstituted formulation. Exemplary vehicles include sterile water, sterile water for injection (WFI), bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), a pH buffered solution (e.g. , phosphate-buffered saline), sterile saline solution, Ringer's solution, or dextrose solution. The buffer can be phosphate, citrate, tartrate, or acetate. In a particular embodiment, the vehicle is phosphate-buffered saline, which is a water-based salt solution containing either sodium chloride or potassium chloride and either sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate. In one embodiment, the phosphate buffer comprises isotonic saline with 5 - 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 4.0 - 9.0, e.g., 5.0 - 8.0, e.g., 5.0 - 7.5. Optionally, the pharmaceutical compositions can further comprise a dispersant, such as, for example, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, cross- linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, and low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose magnesium aluminum silicate, or a mixture thereof. In a particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises: (a) (I) wherein n is an integer between 4 and 14; (b) sorbitan laurate; (c) polysorbate 20; (d) CMC; (e) sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous; (!) sodium dihydrogen phosphate monobasic dihydrate; and (g) water for injection.

The pharmaceutical compositions of these methods also offer minimized excipient levels while co-optimizing both re-suspendability and acceptable injectability, and maintain good physiochemical attributes of the antipsychotic agent. The compositions require reduced resuspension times using, for example, hand shaking. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions can be re-suspended for injection within 1 - 60 seconds of handshaking. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein can also be referred to as "ready to use." When the pharmaceutical composition is to be used as an injectable composition, including but not limited to injection through a needle or needle-less injection, it can be formulated into a conventional injectable vehicle. Suitable vehicles include biocompatible and pharmaceutically acceptable solution and/or emulsions. When the pharmaceutical composition is to be used as an injectable composition, including but not limited to injection through a needle or needle-less injection, it can be formulated into a conventional injectable vehicle. Suitable vehicles include biocompatible and pharmaceutically acceptable solution and/or emulsions. The compositions provided herein do not elicit any injection site reactions normally associated with antipsychotic agents, such as aripiprazole, derivatives thereof, prodrugs thereof, and salts thereof. As used herein, the term "injection site reaction" refers to inflammation or abnormal redness of the tissue and/or the skin at a site of injection in an individual. The modulation of the tissue response following intramusclar (IM) administration is described by the spreadability of the drug and resulting depot morphology; spreading of the drug along the fascial planes of muscle is desirable rather than the formation of a concentrated mass of drug in a small area. Depot morphology resulting from IM injection of aripiprazole and compounds of Formula (I) have been described. Injections of slow-releasing formulations of drugs, including aripiprazole commonly result in the formation of "cyst-like structures", characterized by a vascularized capsule of roughly spherical shape and comprising various cell types, with or without and a central serous fluid compartment. Tissue responses to slow- releasing formulations occur as the body mounts an immune response to clear the material from the injection site; this reaction is commonly referred to as a foreign body response (FBR). The spherical nature of these reactions can result in localized discomfort and pain, as the FBR increases in size compressing on nerve fibers innervating muscle tissue and with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the site. Surprisingly, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein do not elicit an injection site reaction following IM administration. Therefore, in one embodiment, IM adminstration of the phramaceutical compositions provided herein are associated with a reduced tissue and skin reaction at the site of injection. In one embodiment, the injection site reaction is reduced by a particular amount, e.g., about 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, etc. In another embodiment, there is no injection site reaction following IM administration. In particular embodiments, there is no tissue or skin reaction at the site of injection following IM administration. In particular embodiments, IM administration is not associated with the symptoms of the injection site reaction, including, but not limited to: redness, tenderness, warmth, itching, pain at injection site, blistering, nodule formation, and severe skin damage. In one embodiment, components (a), (b), and (c) of the pharmaceutical composition are in a container, and the aqueous vehicle is in a separate container, wherein said container is any receptacle and closure therefor suitable for storing, shipping, dispensing, and/or handling a pharmaceutical product. Examples of such containers include, at least, for example, plastic and glass vials, ampules, pre-filled syringes and cartridges, and the like. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored in a sealed (e.g., septum stoppered), colorless, glass vial. In other embodiments, pre-filled dual-chamber syringes and/or cartridges are utilized with the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein. Pre-filled dual-chamber syringes enable the sequential administration of two separate compositions with a single syringe push, thereby replacing two syringes with one. The benefits of a single delivery capability include increasing the speed and ease of drug administration; reducing risk of infection by reducing the number of connections; lowering the risk of drug administration or sequence errors, and quicker delivery of compositions requiring combination prior to administration. The dual- chamber syringe can accommodate lyophilized, powder, or liquid formulations in the front chamber combined with the aqueous vehicle. Prefilled syringes can contain the exact deliverable dose of desired the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein. The prefilled syringes can contain volumes from about 0.1 mL, 0.2 mL, 0.3 mL, 0.4 mL, 0.5 mL, 0.6 mL, 0.7 mL, 0.8 mL, 0.9 mL, 1.0 mL, 1.5 mL, 2 mL, 2.5 mL, 3 mL, 3.5 mL, 4 mL, 4.5 mL, 5 mL, 5.5 mL, 6 mL, 6.5 mL, 7 mL, 7.5 mL, 8 mL, 8.5 mL, 9 mL, 9.5 mL, 10 mL or more or any other volume increment thereof. The dual syringe and/or cartridge can be side-by-side chambers with separate syringe plungers that mix into a single chamber or linear chambers with one plunger. The dual chamber syringe and/or cartridges can also have a stopper or connector in the middle to serve as a barrier between the two chambers. The stopper or connector can be removed to allow mixing or combining of the individual components in the two chambers. For example, the front chamber can accommodate components (a), (b), and (c) of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein, and the rear chamber can accommodate the aqueous vehicle. Thus, in one embodiment, the pre-filled dual-chamber syringe contains components (a), (b), and (c) of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in the front chamber and the aqueous vehicle in the rear chamber. The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated. The terms "pharmaceutical composition", "formulation", "injectable composition", etc. are used synonymously throughout the application. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be in the form of an emulsion. The term "emulsion" as used in this specification denotes a two-phase system in which one phase is finely dispersed in the other phase. An emulsifier can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions to form the emulsion. The term emulsifier, as used by this invention, denotes an agent that can reduce and/or eliminate the surface and the interfacial tension in a two-phase system. Such an agent possesses both hydrophilic and lipophilic groups in the emulsifier agent. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be in the form of a dispersion. As used herein, the term "dispersion" is to be understood as a mixture in which fine particles of one substance (e.g. , a drug) are scattered throughout another substance (e.g. , a liquid). Dispersions include suspensions and colloids. The methods of the invention include administering the compositions described herein, thereby obtaining an extended release or sustained release profile in the patient. "Extended-release" or "sustained-release" includes dosage forms whose drug-release characteristics of time course and/or location are chosen to accomplish therapeutic or convenience objectives not offered by conventional dosage forms such as a solution or an immediate release dosage form. An extended release profile includes deliveries that achieve a therapeutically effective amount of compound of Formula (I) is present in the plasma of the individual for at least about 7 days, preferably at least about 14 days, or more preferably at least about 21 days; alternatively, for at least 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 weeks, or as much as three months. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered as a single or sole (undivided) dose. However, the composition is also useful for those individuals that require constant or chronic therapy, such as those that receive repeated doses over several hours, days, weeks, months, or more. In such dosing regimens, the method can comprise a first administration of a first extended release composition and a second administration of a second extended release composition. The second composition can be the same, substantially the same or different as the first and can include the same active agent or a different active agent. For example, the second composition can be administered at about 7 days, or more, such as at least about 14 days, or at least about 17 days, after the first administration, where the first administration results in the release of agent for a period of 1 , 2, 3 , 4, 5 , 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 days, or more. The injectable, pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be injected into a patient in any number of ways. The term "injectable" as used herein refers to a composition that is suitable to be delivered to an individual in an injection, such as with an injection device, including one that employs a syringe or a cartridge, which may be housed in a manual injection device or an auto-injection device, for example. Specifically, the injectable composition is suitable for parenteral administration. As used herein, the term "parenteral administration" refers to administration through injection or infusion. Parenteral administration includes, but is not limited to, intravenous administration, intradermal administration, subcutaneous administration or intramuscular administration. The term "intravenous administration" means administration into a vein. "Intradermal administration" is injection into the upper layer of skin (i. e. , the dermis), just beneath the epidermis. "Subcutaneous administration" refers to administration just below the skin. "Intramuscular administration" is the injection directly into a muscle. In preferred embodiments, the injection is in the gluteal muscle or the deltoid muscle. Antipsychotic Agents In one embodi la (I): (I) wherein n is an integer between 4 and 14. (I): wherein n is an integer between 9 and 11. In a particular embodiment of Formula (I), n is 4 (Compound A). In another particular embodiment of Formula (I), n is 10 (Compound 1). Compounds A and 1 are depic Rapid Injection Speeds The standard practice for IM adminstration of antipsychotics is to inject medications at a rate that does not exceed 1 mL per 10 seconds or 0.1 mL/s [Cocoman & Murray, Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing, 2008, Vol. 15, pp. 424-434]. Healthcare professionals suggest that this slow, steady injection rate promotes patient comfort and helps to avoid damage to the muscle tissue [Workman, Nuring Standard, 1999, Vol. 13, pp. 47-53]. In an effort to prevent needle clogging, manual administration of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein was performed using faster injection rates. This study surprisingly revealed that the faster the user injected the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein, the less likely the user was to experience a needle clog. These observations are quantitatively supported by the results from injections of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein performed using an INSTRON® at controlled injection speeds. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3, faster injection speeds are associated with a decrease in the number of injection clogs whereas slower injection speeds are associated with an increased incidence of needle clogging. Furthermore, Table 6 (Example 3) reveals that increased injection speeds are associated with an increase in measured gravimetric dose delivery and, thus, better flow properties. In fact, manual administration of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein revealed that slower injection rates were associated with an increased incidence of injection site failure due to needle clogging (see, e.g., Figures 3, 4 A, and 4B). As shown in Figures 1, 2 A, and 2B, an increase in the incidence of needle clogs was observed with increased needle gauge (i.e., decreased needle inner diameter). Additionally, needle clogs were more pronounced among first time or inexperienced users. Injection failures were also noted primarily with first time users with needle gauges of 21 to 23. No injection failures were noted with experienced users, regardless of needle gauge. Given the results of the in vitro injectability assessment of the pharmaceutical composition administered using various needle gauges, a 20 gauge needle is preferred in order to mitigate the risk of needle clogs. Rapid injection rates are not typically associated with the injection of drugs due the increased potential for injection site reactions to occur. In fact, the prescribing information for many atypical antipsychotics specifies "slow injection" (see Table 2). Surprisingly, however, it has been discovered that the rapid injection rate of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein does not elicit injection site reactions or elevated pain intensities (above a normal threshold). Table 2 summarizes the injection site reactions associated various atypical antipsychotics, including Compound 1. The symptoms of the injection site reaction include, but are not limited to: redness, tenderness, warmth, itching, pain at injection site, blistering, nodule formation, and severe skin damage. Injection site reactions and/or elevated pain levels were reported in patients upon slow injection of ABILIFY MAINTENA® (Aripiprazole Monohydrate), RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (Risperidone), and INVEGA® SUSTENNA® (Paliperidone Palmitate) in comparison with a placebo. In contrast, injection site reactions and/or elevated pain levels were reported in <1% of patients upon fast injection of Compound 1. Table 2.

In some embodiments, the injection rate is greater than 0.3 mL/s. In particular embodiments, the injection rate is greater than about 0.35 mL/s, or greater than about 0.4 mL/s, greater than about 0.5 mL/s, or greater than about 0.6 mL/s, or greater than about 0.7 mL/s, or greater than about 0.8 mL/s, or greater than 0.9 mL/s. In some embodiments, the injection rate is in the range of from about 0.3 mL/s to about 1 mL/s. In some embodiments of the method, the pharmaceutical composition is injected using a 20 to 23 gauge needle. In other embodiments of the method, the needle is a 20 gauge needle. In other embodiments of the method, the needle is a 21 gauge needle. In particular embodiments, the needle does not experience injection failure due to needle clogging. In particular embodiments of the method, a 20 to 23 gauge needle is used to intramuscularly administer a therapeutically effective amount of the composition at an injection rate greater than or equal to 0.3 mL/s, wherein the pharmaceutical composition is as defined above. In some embodiments, the method does not elicit any injection site reactions in the subject. In some embodiments of the method, the injection is administered to the subject in the dorsal gluteal muscle. In other embodiments of the method, the injection is administered to the subject in the deltoid muscle. The administration by injection of a preparation comprising a pharmaceutical compound is often required to be performed in a relatively short time and with a relatively high local concentration of the pharmaceutical agent. This practice is generally referred to in the field as "bolus" injection. The term "bolus injection" thus identifies the administration at once (in general within less than few seconds) of a pharmaceutical agent at a high concentration, differently from a gradual administration of the agent (e.g. by means of intramuscular (IM) infusion). Accordingly, in one embodiment, the method comprises intramuscularly administering a bolus injection of the pharmaceutical composition. In particular embodiments, the bolus injection is administered at a very rapid injection rate. In some embodiments, the bolus injection is injected with an injection rate that is greater than 0.3 mL/s. In other embodiments, the bolus injection is injected instantaneously. In particular embodiments, the needle does not experience injection failure due to needle clogging. Lyophilization The pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be formulated in such a way that the active ingredient and the active ingredient-retaining substance may be dissolved in a suitable solvent and subjected to lyophilization (or freeze-drying) to obtain a sterile cake of the active ingredient and the active ingredient-retaining substance. In one aspect, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein are lyophilized prior to administration. Lyophilization is carried out using techniques common in the art [Tang et al., Pharm Res. 2004, 21, 191-200, and Chang et al., Pharm Res. 1996, 13, 243-249], and has been optimized for the pharmaceutical composition described herein. A lyophilization cycle is, in one aspect, composed of three steps: freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying [A.P. Mackenzie, Phil Trans R Soc London, Ser B, Biol 1977, 278, 167]. In the freezing step, the solution is cooled to initiate ice formation. Furthermore, this step induces the crystallization of the bulking agent. The ice sublimes in the primary drying stage, which is conducted by reducing chamber pressure below the vapor pressure of the ice, using a vacuum and introducing heat to promote sublimation. Finally, adsorbed or bound water is removed at the secondary drying stage under reduced chamber pressure and at an elevated shelf temperature. The process produces a material known as a lyophilized cake. Thereafter the cake can be reconstituted with either sterile water or suitable diluent for injection. In one aspect, provided herein is a lyophilized cake comprising a pharmaceutical composition, wherein said pharmaceutical composition comprises: (a) 15 - 35 weight percent of a compound of Formula (I); (b) 0.25 - 0.45 weight percent sorbitan laurate; and (c) 0.2 - 1 weight percent polysorbate 20 wherein the percentages of (a), (b), and (c) are relative to the total weight of the composition. In another embodiment of the lyophilized cake, the pharmaceutical composition comprises: (a) 24 - 30 weight percent of a compound of Formula (I); (b) 0.3 - 0.4 weight percent sorbitan laurate; and (c) 0.1 - 0.3 weight percent polysorbate 20 wherein the percentages of (a), (b), and (c) are relative to the total weight of the composition. In still another embodiment of the lyophilized cake, the pharmaceutical composition comprises: (a) about 26.6 weight percent of a compound of Formula (I); (b) about 0.37 weight percent sorbitan laurate; and (c) about 0.15 weight percent polysorbate 20 wherein the percentages of (a), (b), and (c) are relative to the total weight of the composition. In an embodiment of the lyophilized cake, the pharmaceutical composition comprises: - 35 weight percent Compound 1: 1 (b) 0.25 - 0.45 weight percent sorbitan laurate; and (c) 0.2 - 1 weight percent polysorbate 20 wherein the percentages of (a), (b), and (c) are relative to the total weight of the composition. In another embodiment of the lyophilized cake, the pharmaceutical composition comprises: - 30 weight percent Compound 1 : 1 (b) 0.3 - 0.4 weight percent sorbitan laurate; and (c) 0.1 - 0.3 weight percent polysorbate 20 wherein the percentages of (a), (b), and (c) are relative to the total weight of the composition. In still another embodiment of the lyophilized cake, the pharmaceutical composition comprises: 1: (b) about 0.37 weight percent sorbitan laurate; and (c) about 0.15 weight percent polysorbate 20 wherein the percentages of (a), (b), and (c) are relative to the total weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the lyophilized cake comprises approximately 1400 mg of the pharmaceutical composition. In preferred embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) is Compound 1. In some embodiments, the lyophilized cake is reconstituted in an aqueous vehicle (e.g., sterile water for injection, an aqueous buffer, or saline solution). In particular embodiments, the lyophilized cake is reconstituted in 3.0 mL of an aqueous vehicle (e.g., sterile water for injection, an aqueous buffer, or saline solution). In particular embodiments, the lyophilized cake is reconstituted in 2.5 mL of an aqueous vehicle (e.g., sterile water for injection, an aqueous buffer, or saline solution). In particular embodiments, the lyophilized cake is reconstituted in 2.0 mL of an aqueous vehicle (e.g., sterile water for injection, an aqueous buffer, or saline solution). In some embodiments, the lyophilized cake can be reconstituted for injection within 1 - 60 seconds of handshaking. In preferred embodiments, the lyophilized cake can be reconstituted for injection within 10 - 20 seconds of handshaking. In one embodiment, the lyophilized cake of the pharmaceutical composition is administered as part of a bolus injection. In one aspect, provided herein is a method for preparing a lyophilized cake of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein. In one embodiment, during the lyophilization process, the solvent system used, such as by way of example only, sterile water for injection is substantially removed by sublimation. In another embodiment, less than about 5 % residual solvent remains after lyophilization; in other embodiments, less than about 3 % remains; in yet other embodiments, less than about 2 % remains; in further embodiments, less than about 1 % or about 0.1 % remains. In one embodiment, the lyophilization process comprises the steps of: (1) placing the sample to be lyophilized (i.e., the pharamceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula (I), sorbitan laurate, and polysorbate 20) in a suitable vial and placing the vial into a lyophilization chamber frozen in a bath until suspension was solidified; (2) cooling the lyophilization chamber and reducing the pressure of the system; and holding until sublimation of the solvent system is substantially complete; and (3) slowly increasing the temperature of the lyophilization chamber to allow the samples to reach an elevated shelf temperature. In another embodiment, the lyophilization process comprises the steps of: (1) placing the sample to be lyophilized (i.e., the pharamceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula (I), sorbitan laurate, and polysorbate 20) in a suitable vial and placing the vial into a lyophilization chamber frozen in a methanol-dry ice bath until suspension was solidified; (2) cooling the lyophilization chamber to -75 °C and reducing the pressure of the system to below 100 mTorr; and holding until sublimation of the solvent system is substantially complete (about 72 hours); and (3) slowly increasing the temperature of the lyophilization chamber to allow the samples to reach a temperature of about 20 °C to about 30 °C. In one embodiment, the lyophilized cake is in a container, and the aqueous vehicle is in a separate container, wherein said container is any receptacle and closure therefor suitable for storing, shipping, dispensing, and/or handling a pharmaceutical product. Examples of such containers include, at least, for example, plastic and glass vials, ampules, pre-filled syringes and cartridges, and the like. In some embodiments, pre-filled dual-chamber syringes and/or cartridges are utilized with the lyophilized cakes provided herein. The dual-chamber syringe can accommodate lyophilized, powder in the front chamber combined with the aqueous vehicle in the rear chamber. Prefilled syringes can contain the exact deliverable dose of desired the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein. The prefilled syringes can contain volumes from about 0.1 mL, 0.2 mL, 0.3 mL, 0.4 mL, 0.5 mL, 0.6 mL, 0.7 mL, 0.8 mL, 0.9 mL, 1.0 mL, 1.5 mL, 2 mL, 2.5 mL, 3 mL, 3.5 mL, 4 mL, 4.5 mL, 5 mL, 5.5 mL, 6 mL, 6.5 mL, 7 mL, 7.5 mL, 8 mL, 8.5 mL, 9 mL, 9.5 mL, 10 mL or more or any other volume increment thereof. The dual syringe and/or cartridge can be side-by-side chambers with separate syringe plungers that mix into a single chamber or linear chambers with one plunger. The dual chamber syringe and/or cartridges can also have a stopper or connector in the middle to serve as a barrier between the two chambers. The stopper or connector can be removed to allow mixing or combining of the compounds in the two chambers. For example, the front chamber can accommodate the lyophilized cake provided herein, and the rear chamber can accommodate the aqueous vehicle. Thus, in one embodiment, pre-filled dual-chamber syringe contains the lyophilized cake provided herein in the front chamber and the aqueous vehicle in the rear chamber.

In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of the agent is given to a subject using the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein. The term "therapeutically effective amount" is further meant to define an amount resulting in the improvement of any parameters or clinical symptoms. The actual dose may vary with each patient and does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disease symptoms. In the case of antipsychotics, the management of exacerbations and maintenance of remission of psychiatric symptoms are main goals of therapy, and selection of the appropriate drug and dosage in a particular disease balances these goals with the minimization of adverse events attributable to the drug. A therapeutically effective amount of the compound used in the treatment described herein can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of conventional techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining the therapeutically effective dose, a number of factors are considered by the attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of mammal; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of or involvement or the severity of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristic of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances. Preferred suitable dosages for the compounds used in the treatment described herein are on the order of about 1 mg to about 600 mg preferably about 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240, 260, 280, 300, 320, 340, 360, 380, 400, 420, 440, 460, 480, 500, 520, 540, 560, 580 to about 600 mgs total of active agent. Dosing schedules may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. For example, administration can be one to three times daily for a time course of one day to several days, weeks, months, and even years, and may even be for the life of the patient. Practically speaking, a unit dose of any given composition used in the treatment described herein can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules, depending on the judgment of the clinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limitation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, every other day, three times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and so forth. Unit dose preparations provided herein can contain a compound of Formula (I) in the range of about 20 to about 900, e.g. , about 60 to about 800, mgs (aripiprazole base equivalents). Preferred amounts according to the selected mode of administration are able to be determined by one skilled in the art. Pharmaceutical compositions can be manufactured utilizing techniques known in the art. Typically the therapeutically effective amount of the compound will be admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Example formulation of the invention. pH range: 5.0 - 7.4 Example III: In vitro assessments of Compound 1 PFS product performance when administered using various needle gauges and at varied injection speeds An in vitro assessment was carried out with an pre-filled syringe (PFS) containing the formulation of Example II. Product performance was assessed by measuring the amount of drug product that was injected after resuspension into a foam resistance model (gravimetric dose delivery with applied resistance). The drug product was injected into open cell (250 to 300 μιη pore size) polyurethane foam and the gravimetric delivered dose is measured. The injection was performed manually by either users who were categorized as experienced or inexperienced or by an INSTRON® universal testing machine at constant injection speed (INSTRON®, Norwood, MA). An experienced user is defined as those that have conducted injections of the Compound 1 drug product previously, such as, physicians or lab analysts. An inexperienced user is defined as personnel that are not lab analysts or those that have never conducted injections of the Compound 1 drug product. Mean inner diameters for needle gauges used in this experiment are listed in Table 4. Table 4. Terumo Needle Gauge and Mean Internal Needle Diameter Needle Manual in vitro assessment of PFS iniectabilty: A total of 1460 injections by 44 users were completed according to the following primary steps: 1. Resuspend the syringe contents by shaking vigorously for -30 seconds 2. Attach needle to the syringe 3. Prime the syringe by bringing it into an upright position, tap the syringe to bring air to the top and then carefully depress the plunger rod until -1-2 drops of suspension are released 4. Inject the full contents into foam in a rapid and continuous manner ( < 10 seconds) 5. If a clog occurs, replace the needle and attempt to complete the injection. If a second clog occurs, continue to the next step 6. Record the weight of the suspension following completion of the injection to determine gravimetric dose delivery. Each user was given a spare needle in the event of a needle clog. Each needle clog was recorded as were injection failures (defined by inability to deliver entire contents of a syringe following use of the spare (2nd) needle). In vitro assessment of PFS iniectabilty using an INSTRON® universal materials tester in compression mode at varied injection speeds: Ten injections were performed at each injection speed according to the following primary steps: 1. Resuspend the syringe contents on a Burrel wrist action shaker for 30 Seconds. 2. Prime the syringe by bringing it into an upright position, tap the syringe to bring air to the top and then carefully depress the plunger rod until -1-2 drops of suspension are released. 3. Place the syringe in the INSTRON® syringe test fixture. 4. Inject the contents of the syringe into the foam at constant injection speed to max force of 40 N. 5. Record the weight following completion of the injection to determine gravimetric dose delivery. One needle replacement was allowed per syringe tested. Each needle clog was recorded as were injection failures (defined by inability to deliver entire contents of a syringe following use of the spare (2nd) needle).

Briefly, 332 subjects enrolled in the study were assigned PFS. Compound 1 is formulated as a pre-filled syringe (PFS) of an extended release aqueous suspension of a therapeutically effective amount of Compound 1. An injection volume of 3.4 mL or 1.6 mL of the aqueous suspension was administered according to protocol I at a rate of less than 10 seconds by inserting the 20 gauge needle in the gluteal muscle. ISRs upon IM injection of Compound 1 were assessed at each visit. Over 5000 injections of Compound 1 have been administered intramuscularly with an ISR rate of less than 1 %. Protocol I 1. TAP the pre-filled syringe at least 10 times to dislodge any material that may have settled. 2. SHAKE the pre-filled syringe vigorously for a minimum of 30 seconds to ensure a uniform suspension. • If the syringe is not used within 15 minutes, re-suspend by shaking vigorously for 30 seconds. 3. SELECT the injection needle. For patients with a larger amount of subcutaneous tissue overlying the gluteal muscle, use the longer of the needles provided to ensure the injectate reaches the intramuscular mass. Both the 1½ and 2 inch administration needles are provided to accommodate varying patient body habitus. 4. ATTACH the injection needle. Remove the syringe tip cap with an easy counterclockwise twisting motion. Attach the appropriate needle with an easy clockwise twisting motion. Remove the needle sheath with straight, firm pull. 5. PRIME the syringe to remove air. Bring the syringe into upright position and tap the syringe to bring air to the top. Remove air by depressing the plunger rod. A few drops of suspension will be released. 6. ADMINISTER the entire contents intramuscularly. Inject in a rapid and continuous manner (less than 10 seconds). DO NOT inject intravenously or subcutaneously. • Prior to injection aspirate for blood. [If blood aspirates, do not inject. Replace with new needle (Steps 3 & 4) and administer into an adjacent site in the same gluteal muscle (Steps 5 & 6).] • If you are unable to complete the injection, replace with new needle (Steps 3 & 4) and readminister into an adjacent site in the same gluteal muscle (Steps 5 & 6). 7. DISPOSE of the needle. Cover the needle by pressing the safety device. Dispose of used and unused items in a proper waste container.
