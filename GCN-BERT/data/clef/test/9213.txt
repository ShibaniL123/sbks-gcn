Example 30: Synthesis of compound 11189, N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)isonicotinamide
[Step 1] Synthesis of N-(4-(2-(2,2-difluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)isonicotinamide
N-(2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)isonicotinamide (0.125 g, 0.327 mmol), synthesized in step 3 of Example 29, and triethylamine (0.091 mL, 0.654 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and 2,2-difluoroacetic anhydride (0.043 mL, 0.392 mmol) was added to the solution, followed by stirring at the same temperature for 1 hour. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound was used without further purification (0.135 g, 89.7%) as a yellow foam solid.
