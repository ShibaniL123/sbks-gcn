PRIORITY CLAIM In accordance with 37 C.F.R. 1.76, a claim of priority is included in an Application Data Sheet filed concurrently herewith. Accordingly, the present invention claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/784,398, entitled “Low Profile Spinal Fixation System”, filed Mar. 14, 2013. The contents of which the above referenced application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a spinal fixation system for the immobilization of spinal bone bodies. The spinal fixation system allows the implantation of the pedicle screws at the preferred anatomical locations and orientation while providing connections between the rod and screws with a minimal amount of force required to the spine or components of the system during assembly. The spinal fixation system provides easier access and installation as well as a low profile to reduce tissue inflammation and surgical trauma. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The spine is a complex structure of vertebral bones and connective tissues. The vertebral bodies, discs and ligaments are configured in operative engagement to perform flexibility for motion, support for body forces and protection for the spinal cord. The structure and functionality of this complex arrangement can be compromised if one or more components are diseased or injured. Often it is possible to treat these problems with conservative non surgical methods such as physical therapy, medication and or exercise. In other instances, such as degenerative instability, deformity, trauma, tumors, etc., necessitate surgical intervention to treat unstable vertebral joints and treat pain caused by root compression. There are a variety of surgical procedures that result in fixation of portions of the spine to one another. In most instances fixation of the spine involves the use of bone screws. These screws are implanted through surgical openings in adjacent portions of the spine and threaded into the spine members. The bone screws are then mechanically connected through additional components such as rods and plates. A number of internal spinal fixation systems have been used in spinal surgery to achieve a rigid fixation. A common technique is the use of posterior implants using pedicle screws coupled to longitudinal rods. Typically posterior implants include a one or more pairs of rods that are positioned along the longitudinal axis of the spine. These rods are attached to the spinal column by bone screws that are threaded into the pedicles of the individual vertebral bodies. The procedure for posterior fixation includes the steps of insertion of the screws into the pedicles in a particular angle and depth, temporarily coupling the rods to the screws, correction of the spinal curve, and the securing of the connection rods to the screws for rigid fixation. The alignment of the pedicle screws is predicated upon the angle and depth of screw insertion which is dependent by the patient's anatomical and pathological conditions that may vary at different spinal levels as well as between patients. A lack of proper alignment will cause considerable difficulty during this procedure. Attempts to compensate for this lack of alignment can result in the creation of undesirable forces being applied to the spinal column via the pedicle screws and will extend the time needed to perform the operation, thereby increasing the possibility of complication associated with surgery. While the surgeon can form a bend in the rod or plate to ensure that the screws are firmly secured to the plate or the rod, such a modification may create stresses that may result in the vertebrae to fracture or the screws to loosen over a period of time. Therefore is highly desirable that the bone fixation system minimizes the possibility of creating unnecessary excessive loads on the spinal column. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART One example of a spinal fixation assembly can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,899, to Small et al, that discloses a surgical spinal fixation system including a bone bolt having first end portions that are adapted to be surgically implanted into a patient's spine at first and second spaced apart positions and a central portion of the bone bolt defining a load transfer surface, the bone bolt having a second upper threaded sections for threadably receiving a nut at a shaped, countersunk interface.

The spinal fixation system 1 includes a pedicle screw 2. The pedicle screw 2 includes a first set of threads 4 that are sized and configured to be screwed into individual pedicles located on the vertebral bodies. The threads 4 have a distal end 6 and a proximal end 8. A cup shaped receiver 10 is formed integral with pedicle screw 2 adjacent the proximal end 8. The cup shaped receiver 10 includes a concave mating surface 12 as can be seen in the cross sectional view shown in FIG. 2. Also formed on pedicle screw 2 is a second set of threads 14. The second set of threads 14 extends from a position spaced from the cup shaped receiver 10 and extends to the uppermost portion of the pedicle screw 2 located at the end opposite the distal end of the screw 2. A locking nut 16 includes a threaded central aperture 18. The second set of threads 14 is sized and configured to operatively engage the threads 18 formed on central aperture of locking nut 16. The screw 2 is threaded into a vertebral body with a wire 20 secured to the proximal end of the screw 2. Alternatively, a cannulated screw can be guided into position with the assistance of a K-wire, not shown. A connector plate 30 has a first end 32 and a second end 34. The first end 32 includes an upper concave surface 35 and a lower convex surface 36. Once the locking nut 16 is threaded into contact with the connector plate 30 the upper concave surface 35 forms a mating surface with a convex surface 38 formed on a lower portion of locking nut 16. In a like fashion the lower convex surface 36 on the first end 32 of the connector plate 30 forms a mating surface with the concave mating surface 12 formed on the cup shaped receiver 10. The operative engagement between the cup shaped receiver 10, the upper mating surface 35, lower mating surface 36 of the connector plate 30 and the convex surface mating surface 38 on the lower surface of the locking nut 16 provides a polyaxial connection between the pedicle screw 2 and the connector plate 30. The connector plate 30 has a length, a width and a thickness. Along its length the connector plate 30 includes a curved surface wherein the first end 32 is in a lower horizontal plane relative to a horizontal plane of the second end 34. At the second end 34 of the connector plate 30 is a slot 40. The slot 40 is oblong in shaped and includes a concave inner edge surface 42 around its perimeter. The spinal fixation system 1 includes a spinal rod 60 that is connected to the connector plate 30 with a rod connector member 44 and a rod connector locking nut 46. The rod connector member 44 includes an aperture 46 that has a diameter just slightly larger than the diameter of the spinal rod 60 thereby allowing relative rotary motion between the rod 60 and rod connector member 44 under the application of force. Tension ring 47 mounted within the aperture 46 provides a friction fit between the rod connector member 44 and the rod 60 to increase the handling ability of the spinal assembly 1 and improve the ease of construct. The upper portion of rod connector member 44 includes a post 48. Post 48 has a set of threads 50 formed on the outer cylindrical surface of the post 48. A rod connector member locking nut 52 has a threaded central aperture. The threads 54 are sized and configured to operatively engage threads 50 formed on the post 48. Rod connector member locking nut 52 has a lower convex surface 56 that is sized and configured to mate with the concave inner edge surface 42 around the perimeter of slot 40. The operative engagement between the inner edge surface 42 and the lower convex surface 56 of the rod connector member locking nut 52 provides a polyaxial connection between the spinal rod 60 and the connector plate 30. The spinal assembly 1 includes two or more pedicle screws 4 and associated connector plates 30, locking nuts 16 and 52 and rod connector members 44 are interconnected by a spinal rod 60. Typically posterior implants include a one or more pairs of rods that are positioned along the longitudinal axis of the spine. These rods are attached to the spinal column by bone screws that are threaded into the pedicles of the individual vertebral bodies. As shown in FIG. 3, locking nut 16 and rod connector member locking nut 52 each include a recess 62 formed in their upper surfaces that are dimensioned to operatively engage a distal end of a tool that will impart rotation thereto and cause the locking nut and rod locking nut to be threaded into position. The pedicle screw 4 can either have a wire 20 attachment that is sheared off after it is used or the screw can be cannulated and inserted by K-wire. The upper portion of the pedicle screw 4 includes a weaken area 64 located in the area of the second set of threads 14 that permits the upper end to be broken off after it is no longer needed so as to provide a low profile for the pedicle screw 4. The screws are either positioned by K-wire through a cannulated pedicle screw or include a wire 20 attached to the proximate end of the screw 4. The connector plate 30, rod 60, rod connector member 44 and rod connector member locking nut 52 are assembled outside of the body and are then placed into position using one or more guide wires. The assembly is easily inserted into the wound as it is dropped down detachable guide wires and right on to the pedicle screws 4. The ability to infinity position and the rod relative to the pedicle screws eliminates the need for rod bending to conform to the anatomic anomalies of the spine and provides a high degree of conformity to the anatomy of the posterior spine. FIG. 4 is an exploded view of the spinal assembly with the individual components separated for the purposes of clarity. FIG. 5 is a top perspective view of the connector plate 30 of the spinal fixation system 1. As shown, the connector plate 30 has a first end 32 and a second end 34. The first end 32 includes an upper concave surface 35. The second end 34 of the connector plate 30 includes a slot 40. The slot 40 is oblong in shaped and includes a concave inner edge surface 42 around the upper surface of the perimeter of the slot 40. FIG. 6 is a bottom perspective view of the connector plate 30 of the spinal fixation system 1. As shown the connector plate 30 includes a lower concave surface 36 at the first end 32 of connector plate 30. The slot 40 has a concave surface 43 located around the lower surface of the perimeter of slot 40. The concave surface 43 is configured to conform to the spherical surface 45 on rod connector member 44. FIG. 7 is a perspective side view of the rod connector member 44. As shown, the rod connector member 44 includes a post having external threads 50. The threads 54 on the rod connector member locking nut 52 are sized and configured to operatively engage threads 50 formed on the post 48. The rod connector member 44 includes an aperture 46 that has a diameter just slightly larger than the diameter of the spinal rod 60 thereby allowing relative rotary motion between the rod 60 and rod connector member 44 under the application of force. Tension ring 47 mounted within the aperture 46 provides a friction fit between the rod connector member 44 and the rod 60 to increase the handling ability of the spinal assembly 1 and improve the ease of construct. FIG. 8 is also a perspective side view of the rod connector member 44 with the longitudinal axis of aperture 46 oriented perpendicular to this view.
