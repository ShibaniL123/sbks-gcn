The present invention relates to a cosmetic treatment process in particular for depigmenting and/or whitening the skin, that employs at least one compound of thiopyridinone type. At various periods in their life, certain people develop darker and/or more coloured marks on their skin, and more especially on the hands, which gives the skin a heterogeneous appearance. These marks are due in particular to a high concentration of melanin in the keratinocytes located at the surface of the skin. The use of harmless topical depigmenting substances which exhibit good efficacy is especially desirable with a view to treating pigmentary marks. The mechanism of formation of skin pigmentation, i.e. of the formation of melanin, is particularly complex and involves, schematically, the following principal steps: Tyrosine--->Dopa--->Dopaquinone--->Dopachrome--->Melanin Tyrosinase (monophenol dihydroxyl phenylalanine: oxygen oxidoreductase EC 1.14.18.1) is the essential enzyme involved in this series of reactions. It catalyzes in particular the reaction converting tyrosine to Dopa (dihydroxyphenylalanine) by virtue of its hydroxylase activity, and the reaction converting Dopa to dopaquinone by virtue of its oxidase activity. This tyrosinase acts only when it is in the mature form, under the action of certain biological factors. A substance is acknowledged to be depigmenting if it acts directly on the vitality of epidermal melanocytes, where melanogenesis takes place, and/or if it interferes with one of the steps of melanin biosynthesis, either by inhibiting one of the enzymes involved in melanogenesis, or by being inserted as a structural analogue of one of the chemical compounds of the melanin synthesis chain, which chain may then be blocked and thus ensure depigmentation. Arbutin, niacinamide and kojic acid are known as skin depigmenting agents. Substances have been sought which exhibit an effective depigmenting action, in particular greater than that of arbutin, niacinamide and kojic acid. In this regard, the applicant has found, surprisingly and unexpectedly, that certain thiopyridinone compounds exhibit good depigmenting activity, even at low concentration. The subject of the invention is therefore a nontherapeutic cosmetic process for depigmenting, lightening and/or whitening keratin materials, in particular the skin, which comprises the application of a cosmetic composition comprising, in a physiologically acceptable medium, at least one compound of formula (I) as defined hereinafter. The invention also relates to the nontherapeutic cosmetic use of a compound of formula (I) as a whitening, lightening and/or depigmenting agent for keratin materials, in particular the skin. The compounds used according to the invention allow effective depigmenting and/or lightening, or even whitening, of the skin of human beings. They are in particular intended to be applied to the skin of individuals exhibiting brownish pigmentation marks or senescence marks, or to the skin of individuals who wish to combat the appearance of a brownish colour arising from melanogenesis. They may also allow depigmentation and/or lightening of body hair, the eyelashes, head hair and also the lips and/or the nails. The compounds used according to the invention therefore correspond to formula (I) or (I′) below: in which: R1 and R2, which may be identical or different, denote a radical chosen from: a) a hydrogen atom;b) a saturated linear C1-C20 or branched C3-C20 or unsaturated C2-C20 alkyl group, optionally interrupted with one or more heteroatoms chosen from N, S and O, and/or optionally substituted with one or more groups, which may be identical or different, chosen from: i) —OR3 ii) —SR3,iii) —NR3R4 iv) —CONHR3 v) —COOR3;vi) a C5-C12 aryl group optionally substituted with one or more hydroxyls and/or with one or more C1-C8 alkoxy radicals;c) a saturated C1-C8 alkyl group substituted with a C5-C12 aryl radical optionally substituted with one or more hydroxyls and/or with one or more C1-C8 alkoxy radicals;d) a phenyl group optionally substituted with one or more hydroxyls and/or with one or more C1-C8 alkoxy radicals;R3 denoting a hydrogen atom or a saturated linear C1-C5 or branched C3-C5 or unsaturated C2-C5 hydrocarbon-based group,R4 denoting a hydrogen atom; a saturated linear C1-C5 or branched C3-C5 hydrocarbon-based group; or an acetyl group; it being possible for R1 and R2 to form, with the nitrogen atom which bears them, a ring chosen from pyrrolidine, pyrroline, piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, thiomorpholine and azepine; and also the salts thereof, the solvates thereof and the optical isomers thereof, and the racemates thereof. The compound (I′) is the tautomer form of the compound (I) when a tautomeric equilibrium exists according to the following scheme: The salts of the compounds of formula (I) or (I′) comprise the conventional nontoxic salts of said compounds, such as those formed from acid or from base. As salts of the compound of formula (I) or (I′), when it comprises a quaternizable nitrogen atom), mention may be made of: a) the salts obtained by addition of the compound (I) or (I′) with an inorganic acid, in particular chosen from hydrochloric acid, boric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrioic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid and tetrafluoroboric acid;b) or the salts obtained by addition of the compound (I) or (I′) with an organic acid, in particular chosen from acetic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, salicylic acid, tartaric acid, terephthalic acid, methylsulphonic acid, ethylsulphonic acid, benzene-sulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid and triflic acid. Mention may also be made of the salts obtained by addition of the compound of formula (I) or (I′) (when it comprises an acid group) with an inorganic base, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, and sodium, potassium or calcium carbonates or hydrogen carbonates, for example; or with an organic base, such as a primary, secondary or tertiary alkylamine, for example triethylamine or butylamine. This primary, secondary or tertiary alkylamine may comprise one or more nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms and may therefore comprise, for example, one or more alcohol functions; mention may in particular be made of 2-amino-2-methylpropanol, ethanolamine, triethanolamine, 2-dimethylaminopropanol, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol and 3-(dimethylamino)propylamine. Mention may also be made of amino acids such as, for example, lysine, arginine, guanidine, glutamic acid or aspartic acid. Advantageously, the salts of the compounds of formula (I) or (I′) (when it comprises an acid group) may be chosen from alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, such as sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium salts; and ammonium salts. Advantageously, the salts of the compounds of formula (I) or (I′) (when it comprises a quaternizable nitrogen atom) can be chosen from halides such as chloride or bromide; and citrates, acetates, succinates, phosphates, lactates and tartrates. The acceptable solvates of the compounds described in the present invention comprise conventional solvates such as those formed during the preparation of said compounds as a result of the presence of solvents. By way of example, mention may be made of the solvates resulting from the presence of water or of linear or branched alcohols such as ethanol or isopropanol. The optical isomers are in particular enantiomers and diastereoisomers. Preferentially, the linear or branched groups can be chosen from: methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, nonadecyl and eicosyl. More preferentially, the saturated linear or branched alkyl groups can be chosen from methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl and octyl. Preferentially, the C1-C4 alkoxy groups can be chosen from methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and butoxy, and even more preferentially methoxy. The compounds of formula (I) can be obtained, in a known manner, by reacting 2-mercaptonicotinic acid and an amine of formula HNR1R2 (R1 and R2 having the meanings described above), in particular in the presence of a base such as carbonyldiimidazole. The compounds of formula (I) can also be obtained, in a known manner, by reacting 2-mercaptonicotinic acid or 2-chloronicotinic acid with an amine of formula HNR1R2 (R1 and R2 having the meanings described above), in particular in the presence of an agent for activating carboxylic acids according to the conventional methods for activating acids (described, for example, in Comprehensive Organic Transformation by R. Larock, published by Wiley VCH, in the chapter Interconversion of nitriles, carboxylic acids and derivatives). Use is preferably made of an agent for activating carboxylic acids which makes it possible to form an acid chloride (for example, using thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride, or 1-chloro-N,N,2-trimethyl-1-propenamine) or to form a mixed anhydride (using alkyl chloroformates), or carbodiimides or diethyl cyanophosphate are used to form carbamimidates or acylphosphonates (Phosphorus in organic synthesis-XI, Amino acids and peptides-XXI, Reaction of diethyl phosphorocyanidate with carboxylic acids. A new synthesis of carboxylic esters and amides, Tetrahedron, 32, 1976, 2211-2217). When 2-chloronicotinic acid is used as starting reagent, the chloroamide obtained is then used in an exchange reaction between chlorine and sulphur by means of reagents such as NaSH, thiourea, sodium thiosulphate or thioacetic acid (in basic medium).

The photoprotective agents are generally present in the composition used according to the invention in proportions ranging from 0.1 to 20% by weight, preferably ranging from 0.2 to 15% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition. The composition used according to the invention may be in any of the galenical forms normally used in the cosmetics field, and in particular in the form of an optionally gelled aqueous or aqueous-alcoholic solution, a dispersion, optionally a two-phase dispersion, of the lotion type, an oil-in-water or water-in-oil or multiple (W/O/W or O/W/O) emulsion, an aqueous gel, a dispersion of oil in an aqueous phase by means of spherules, it being possible for these spherules to be polymeric nanoparticles such as nanospheres and nanocapsules or, better still, lipid vesicles of ionic and/or nonionic type; or aqueous or oily gels. These compositions are prepared according to the usual methods. According to this invention, a composition in the form of an emulsion, in particular an oil-in-water emulsion, is preferably used. The composition used according to the invention may constitute a skincare composition, and in particular a cleansing, protecting, treatment or care cream for the face, for the hands, for the feet, for the major anatomical folds or for the body (for example, day creams, night creams, makeup-removing creams, foundation creams, antisun creams); a fluid foundation, a makeup-removing milk, a protective or care body milk or an antisun milk; a skincare lotion, gel or foam, such as a cleansing lotion. The invention is illustrated in greater detail by the following nonlimiting examples. EXAMPLES 1 TO 4 Demonstration of the Activity on Constitutive Melanogenesis A biological test demonstrated the depigmenting activity of 7 compounds of formula (I) (compounds 2, 7, 12, 16, 19, 21 and 27). The modulatory effect of each compound on melanogenesis was measured according to the method described in FR-A-2734825 and also in the article by R. Schmidt, P. Krien and M. Régnier, Anal. Bichem., 235(2), 113-18, 1996. This test is carried out on a coculture of keratinocytes and melanocytes. For the compounds tested, the following were determined: the cytotoxicity, by estimating leucine incorporation,the inhibitory activity on melanin synthesis, by estimating the ratio of thiouracil incorporation to leucine incorporation, relative to 100% of the control (the control corresponds to the test carried out without test compound). The 1050 values (concentration for which 50% of the melanin synthesis is inhibited) were determined. The test was also carried out with arbutin, niacinamide and kojic acid, which are known depigmenting compounds. The results are collated in the following table: Cyto- toxicity on co- Compound culture IC50 Arbutin Non- Not attained cytotoxic (or greater than 500 μM) Kojic acid 100 μM Not attained (or greater than 500 μM) Niacinamide Non- Not attained cytotoxic Non- cytotoxic 4.9 μM Non- cytotoxic 37 μM 100 μM 25 μM Non- cytotoxic 32 μM Non- cytotoxic 29 μM Non- cytotoxic 410 μM Non- cytotoxic 128 μM Compounds 2, 7, 12, 16, 19, 21 and 27 therefore demonstrate their efficacy in inhibiting melanogenesis and are, moreover, more effective than arbutin, kojic acid and niacinamide. Compound 2 is the most effective compound.
