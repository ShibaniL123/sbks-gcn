Step 2
1-(4-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)butyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
5-(3,7-Dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purine-1-yl)pentanenitrile (400 mg, 1.53 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL), sodium azide (299 mg, 4.60 mmol) and ammonium chloride (244 mg, 0.740 mmol) were added. The reaction solution was heated to 130Â°C and stirred for 80 hours, then cooled to room temperature. Saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (30 mL) was added, and the solution was extracted with dichloromethane (30 mL x 2), and the organic phases were combined. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by preparative HPLC to give 1-(4-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)butyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (250 mg) with a yield of 54%.
