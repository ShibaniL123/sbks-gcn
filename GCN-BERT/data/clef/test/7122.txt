The compound 19 (200.2 mg, 0.50 mmol) and the compound 17 (170.0 mg, 0.36 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (dehydrated) (16.8 mL), molecular sieves 4A (1.6 g) were added, and the mixture was stirred. Then, the mixture was cooled to −25° C., and N-iodosuccinimide (87.6 mg, 0.40 mmol) was added. After 30 minutes, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (28.0 μL) was added, and the mixture was stirred at 0° C. The disappearance of the compound 17 was confirmed by TLC after 30 minutes. The molecular sieves 4A were removed by suction filtration, and then the filtrate was diluted by adding ethyl acetate (50 mL). The organic layer was washed with a saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution (40 mL), a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, and brine. The organic layer was dried by adding anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (chloroform/methanol=30/1-10/1) to obtain a compound 20 as a white crystal (251 mg, 0.46 mmol, 91%).
