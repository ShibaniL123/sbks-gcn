ACC INHIBITORS AND USES THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] Obesity is a health crisis of epic proportions. The health burden of obesity, measured by quality-adjusted life-years lost per adult, has surpassed that of smoking to become the most serious, preventable cause of death. In the US, about 34% of adults have obesity, up from 31% in 1999 and about 15% in the years 1960 through 1980. Obesity increases the rate of mortality from all causes for both men and women at all ages and in all racial and ethnic groups. Obesity also leads to social stigmatization and discrimination, which decreases quality of life dramatically. The chronic diseases that result from obesity cost the US economy more than $150 billion in weight-related medical bills each year. Furthermore, about half of the obese population, and 25% of the general population, have metabolic syndrome, a condition associated with abdominal obesity, hypertension, increased plasma triglycerides, decreased HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance, which increases the risk for type-2 diabetes (T2DM), stroke and coronary heart disease. [Harwood, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 9: 267, 2005], [0002] Diet and exercise, even when used in conjunction with the current pharmacotherapy, do not provide sustainable weight loss needed for long-term health benefit. Currently, only a few anti-obesity drugs are approved in the US, the fat absorption inhibitor orlistat (Xenical®), the 5-ΗΤ2℮ antagonist lorcaserin (Belviq®), and the combination therapy phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia®). Unfortunately, poor efficacy and unappealing gastrointestinal side effects limit the use of orlistat. Surgery can be effective but is limited to patients with extremely high body-bass indices (BMI) and the low throughput of surgery limits the impact of this modality to about 200k patients per year. The majority of obesity drugs in clinical development are designed to reduce caloric intake through central action in the CNS (e.g., anorectics and satiety agents). However, the FDA has taken an unfavorable position against CNS-active agents, due to their modest efficacy and observed/potential side-effect profiles. [0003] The continuing and increasing problem of obesity, and the current lack of safe and effective drugs for treating it, highlight the overwhelming need for new drugs to treat this condition and its underlying causes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0004] It has now been found that compounds of this invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof, are effective as inhibitors of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Such compounds have the general formula I: or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein each variable is as defined and described herein. [0005] Compounds of the present invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof, are useful for treating a variety of diseases, disorders or conditions, associated with regulation of the production or oxidation of fatty acids.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. [0086] For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents that are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation. [0087] Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers commonly used include lactose and com starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added. [0088] Alternatively, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These can be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols. [0089] Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs. [0090] Topical application for the lower intestinal tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches may also be used. [0091] For topical applications, provided pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water.

Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. [0092] For ophthalmic use, provided pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with or without a preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum. [0093] Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques wellknown in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents. [0094] Most preferably, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention are formulated for oral administration. Such formulations may be administered with or without food. In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention are administered without food. In other embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention are administered with food. [0095] The amount of compounds of the present invention that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a composition in a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated, the particular mode of administration. Preferably, provided compositions should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of the inhibitor can be administered to a patient receiving these compositions. [0096] It should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of a compound of the present invention in the composition will also depend upon the particular compound in the composition. Uses of Compounds and Pharmaceutically Acceptable Compositions [0097] Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA. This reaction, which proceeds in two half-reactions, a biotin carboxylase (BC) reaction and a carboxyltransferase (CT) reaction, is the first committed step in fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis and is the rate-limiting reaction for the pathway. In addition to its role as a substrate in FA biosynthesis, malonyl-CoA, the product of the ACC-catalyzed reaction, also plays an important regulatory role in controlling mitochondrial FA uptake through allosteric inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I), the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in mitochondrial FA oxidation. Malonyl-CoA, therefore, is a key metabolic signal for the control of FA production and utilization in response to dietary changes and altered nutritional requirements in animals, for example during exercise, and therefore plays a key role in controlling the switch between carbohydrate and fat utilization in liver and skeletal muscle [Harwood, 2005], [0098] In mammals, ACC exists as two tissue-specific isozymes, ACC1 which is present in lipogenic tissues (liver, adipose) and ACC2, which is present in oxidative tissues (liver, heart, skeletal muscle). ACC1 and ACC2 are encoded by separate genes, display distinct cellular distributions, and share 75% overall amino acid sequence identity, except for an extension at the N-terminus of ACC2 that direct ACC2 to the mitochondrial membrane. ACC1, which lacks this targeting sequence, is localized to the cytoplasm. In the heart and skeletal muscle, which have a limited capacity to synthesize fatty acids, the malonyl-CoA formed by ACC2 functions to regulate FA oxidation. In the liver, the malonyl-CoA formed in the cytoplasm through the actions of ACC1 is utilized for FA synthesis and elongation leading to triglyceride formation and VLDL production, whereas the malonyl-CoA formed at the mitochondrial surface by ACC2 acts to regulate FA oxidation [Tong and Harwood, J. Cellular Biochem. 99: 1476, 2006], This compartmentalization of malonyl-CoA results from a combination of synthesis proximity [Abu-Elheiga et αℓ., PNAS (USA) 102: 12011, 2005] and the rapid action of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase [Cheng et αℓ., J. Med. Chern. 49:1517, 2006], [0099] Simultaneous inhibition of the enzymatic activities of ACC1 and ACC2 offers the ability to inhibit de novo FA production in lipogenic tissues (e.g. liver & adipose) while at the same time stimulating FA oxidation in oxidative tissues (e.g. liver & skeletal muscle) and therefore offers an attractive modality for favorably affecting, in a concerted manner, a multitude of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome. [00100] Several lines of evidence strongly support the concept of direct inhibition of ACC activity as an important therapeutic target for treating obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome. [00101] Abu-Elheiga et αℓ. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:10207-10212, 2003] demonstrated that ACC2 knock-out mice exhibit reduced skeletal and cardiac muscle malonyl-CoA, increased muscle FA oxidation, reduced hepatic fat, reduced total body fat, elevated skeletal muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) which is indicative of increased energy expenditure, reduced body weight, reduced plasma free FAs, reduced plasma glucose, and reduced tissue glycogen, and are protected from diet-induced diabetes and obesity. [00102] Savage et αℓ. \J. Clin. Invest. 116: 817, 2006], using ACC1 and ACC2 antisense oligonucleotides, demonstrated stimulation of FA oxidation in isolated rat hepatocytes and in rats fed high-fat diets, and lowering of hepatic triglycerides, improvements in insulin sensitivity, reductions in hepatic glucose production, and increases in UCP1 mRNA in high fat-fed rats. These effects were greater when both ACC1 and ACC2 expression were suppressed than when either ACC1 or ACC2 expression alone was suppressed. [00103] Harwood et αℓ. [J. Biol. Chern. 278: 37099, 2003] demonstrated that the isozyme-nonselective ACC inhibitor, CP-640186, which equally inhibits ACC1 and ACC2 (IC50 = ~60 ηΜ) isolated from rat, mouse, monkey and human without inhibiting either pyruvate carboxylase or propionyl-CoA carboxylase, reduced FA synthesis, triglyceride synthesis and secretion in Hep-G2 cells without affecting cholesterol synthesis, and reduced apoB secretion without affecting apoAl secretion. CP-640186 also stimulated FA oxidation in C2C12 cells and in rat muscle slices and increased CPT-I activity in Hep-G2 cells. In experimental animals, CP-640186 acutely reduced malonyl-CoA concentration in both lipogenic and oxidative tissues in both the fed and fasted state, reduced liver and adipose tissue FA synthesis, and increased whole body FA oxidation. In sucrose-fed rats treated with CP-640186 for three weeks, CP-640186 time- and dose-dependently reduced liver, muscle and adipose triglycerides, reduced body weight due to selective fat reduction without reducing lean body mass, reduced leptin levels, reduced the hyperinsulinemia produced by the high sucrose diet without changing plasma glucose levels, and improved insulin sensitivity. [00104] Saha et αℓ. [.Diabetes 55:Α288, 2006] demonstrated stimulation of insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant rat muscle tissue by CP-640186 within 30 min of compound administration, and studies by Furler et αℓ. [Diabetes 55:Α333, 2006] used dual tracer analysis to show that acute (46 min) treatment of rats with CP-640186 stimulated FA clearance without decreasing glucose clearance. [00105] ACC is the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis and its product, malonyl CoA, serves as an important regulator of fatty acid oxidation. Hence, ACC inhibitors both reduce c/e novo lipid synthesis and promote the oxidation of existing fat. This dual effect on lipid metabolism raises the possibility that ACC inhibitors will be substantially more effective in reducing excess fat than other mechanisms. Furthermore, ACC inhibitors will impact insulin sensitivity, plasma and tissue triglycerides, and fasting plasma glucose as a consequence of whole-body and tissue-specific fat mass reduction without the need for poly-pharmacy. [00106] ACC inhibitors need only access the liver and muscle in the peripheral compartment. Avoiding the CNS will address many of side effects associated with the late-stage obesity programs targeting CNS receptors. ACC inhibitors are also expected to have superior safety profiles to existing metabolic disease agents. For example, it is unlikely that an ACC inhibitor will precipitate life-threatening hypoglycemia as is often seen with insulin mimetics, insulin secretagogues, and insulin degradation inhibitors. Also, since ACC inhibitors will reduce whole-body fat mass, they will be superior to the glitazones that increase whole-body fat mass as part of their mechanism of action. [00107] A peripherally acting agent that causes significant weight loss and improves other metabolic endpoints fits well within the US FDA’s requirements for approval of a new obesity agent. However, if an approval for obesity continues to be challenging in 5-7 years, ACC inhibitors could be approved for familial combined hyperlipidemia and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). There are currently no marketed ACC inhibitors, so an isozyme-nonselective ACC inhibitor would represent first-in-class therapy for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome. [00108] The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as an inhibitor of ACC or treatment for obesity or metabolic syndrome, may be assayed in vitro or in vivo. An in vivo assessment of the efficacy of the compounds of the invention may be made using an animal model of obesity or metabolic syndrome, e.g., a rodent or primate model. Cell-based assays may be performed using, e.g., a cell line isolated from a tissue that expresses ACC. Additionally, biochemical or mechanism-based assays, e.g., transcription assays using a purified protein, Northern blot, RT-PCR, etc., may be performed. In vitro assays include assays that determine cell morphology, protein expression, and/or the cytotoxicity, enzyme inhibitory activity, and/or the subsequent functional consequences of treatment of cells with compounds of the invention. Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to protein or nucleic acid molecules within the cell. Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/target molecule complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with purified proteins or nucleic acids bound to known radioligands. Detailed conditions for assaying a compound utilized in this invention as an inhibitor of ACC are set forth in the Examples below. The aforementioned assays are exemplary and not intended to limit the scope of the invention. The skilled practitioner can appreciate that modifications can be made to conventional assays to develop equivalent assays that obtain the same result.

[00133] The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. The term “patient”, as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human. [00134] The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracistemally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. [00135] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. [00136] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. [00137] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. [00138] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactidepolyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. [00139] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. [00140] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, ℮) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. [00141] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hardfilled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like. [00142] The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. [00143] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.

[00166] In certain embodiments, compounds of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof, are administered in combination with antisense agents, a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody or an siRNA therapeutic. [00167] Those additional agents may be administered separately from an inventive compound-containing composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen. Alternatively, those agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with a compound of this invention in a single composition. If administered as part of a multiple dosage regime, the two active agents may be submitted simultaneously, sequentially or within a period of time from one another, normally within five hours from one another. [00168] As used herein, the term “combination,” “combined,” and related terms refers to the simultaneous or sequential administration of therapeutic agents in accordance with this invention. For example, a compound of the present invention may be administered with another therapeutic agent simultaneously or sequentially in separate unit dosage forms or together in a single unit dosage form. Accordingly, the present invention provides a single unit dosage form comprising a compound of formula I, an additional therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. [00169] The amount of both, an inventive compound and additional therapeutic agent (in those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent as described above) that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Preferably, compositions of this invention should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of an inventive can be administered. [00170] In those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent, that additional therapeutic agent and the compound of this invention may act synergistically. Therefore, the amount of additional therapeutic agent in such compositions will be less than that required in a monotherapy utilizing only that therapeutic agent. In such compositions a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 Lig/kg body weight/day of the additional therapeutic agent can be administered. [00171] The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent. [00172] The invention further refers to an agricultural composition comprising at least one compound of formula I as defined above or an agriculturally acceptable salt thereof and a liquid or solid carrier. Suitable carriers, as well as auxiliaries and further active compounds which may also be contained in the composition of the invention are defined below. [00173] Suitable “agriculturally acceptable salts” include but are not limited to the salts of those cations or the acid addition salts of those acids whose cations and anions, respectively, have no adverse effect on the fungicidal action of the compounds of formula I. Thus, suitable cations are in particular the ions of the alkali metals, preferably sodium and potassium, of the alkaline earth metals, preferably calcium, magnesium and barium, and of the transition metals, preferably manganese, copper, zinc and iron, and also the ammonium ion which, if desired, may carry one to four Ci-C4-alkyl substituents and/or one phenyl or benzyl substituent, preferably diisopropylammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, trimethylbenzylammonium. Additional agriculturally acceptable salts include phosphonium ions, sulfonium ions, preferably tri(Ci-C4-alkyl)sulfonium and sulfoxonium ions, preferably tri(Ci-C4-alkyl)sulfoxonium. Anions of useful acid addition salts are primarily chloride, bromide, fluoride, hydrogen- sulfate, sulfate, dihydrogenphosphate, hydrogenphosphate, phosphate, nitrate, bicarbonate, carbonate, hexafluorosilicate, hexafluorophosphate, benzoate, and also the anions of Ci-C4-alkanoic acids, preferably formate, acetate, propionate and butyrate. Such agriculturally acceptable acid addition salts can be formed by reacting compounds of formula I bearing a basic ionizable group with an acid of the corresponding anion, preferably hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or nitric acid. [00174] The compounds of formula I and the compositions according to the invention, respectively, are suitable as fungicides. They are distinguished by an outstanding effectiveness against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, including soil-bome fungi, which derive especially from the classes of the Plasmodiophoromycetes, Peronosporomycetes (syn. Oomycetes), Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes (syn. Fungi imperfecti). Some are systemically effective and they can be used in crop protection as foliar fungicides, fungicides for seed dressing and soil fungicides. Moreover, they are suitable for controlling harmful fungi, which inter alia occur in wood or roots of plants. [00175] In some embodiments, the compounds of formula I and the compositions according to the invention are particularly important in the control of phytopathogenic fungi on various cultivated plants, such as cereals, e.g. wheat, rye, barley, triticale, oats or rice; beet, e.g. sugar beet or fodder beet; fruits, such as pomes, stone fruits or soft fruits, e.g. apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries or gooseberries; leguminous plants, such as lentils, peas, alfalfa or soybeans; oil plants, such as rape, mustard, olives, sunflowers, coconut, cocoa beans, castor oil plants, oil palms, ground nuts or soybeans; cucurbits, such as squashes, cucumber or melons; fiber plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; citrus fruit, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits or mandarins; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, cucurbits or paprika; lauraceous plants, such as avocados, cinnamon or camphor; energy and raw material plants, such as com, soybean, rape, sugar cane or oil palm; com; tobacco; nuts; coffee; tea; bananas; vines (table grapes and grape juice grape vines); hop; turf; natural mbber plants or ornamental and forestry plants, such as flowers, shrubs, broad-leaved trees or evergreens, e.g. conifers; and on the plant propagation material, such as seeds, and the crop material of these plants. [00176] In some embodiments, compounds of formula I and compositions thereof, respectively are used for controlling a multitude of fungi on field crops, such as potatoes sugar beets, tobacco, wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, com, cotton, soybeans, rape, legumes, sunflowers, coffee or sugar cane; fruits; vines; ornamentals; or vegetables, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, beans or squashes. [00177] The term "plant propagation material" is to be understood to denote all the generative parts of the plant such as seeds and vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers (e.g. potatoes), which can be used for the multiplication of the plant. This includes seeds, roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, shoots, sprouts and other parts of plants, including seedlings and young plants, which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from soil. These young plants may also be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion or pouring. [00178] In some embodiments, treatment of plant propagation materials with compounds of formula I and compositions thereof, respectively, is used for controlling a multitude of fungi on cereals, such as wheat, rye, barley and oats; rice, com, cotton and soybeans. [00179] The term "cultivated plants" is to be understood as including plants which have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering including but not limiting to agricultural biotech products on the market or in development. Genetically modified plants are plants, which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding, mutations or natural recombination. Typically, one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post-translational modification of protein(s), oligo- or polypeptides e.g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated, acetylated or famesylated moieties or PEG moieties. [00180] Plants that have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering, e.g. have been rendered tolerant to applications of specific classes of herbicides, such as hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors; acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, such as sulfonyl ureas (see e.g. US 6,222,100, WO 01/82685, WO 00/26390, WO 97/41218, WO 98/02526, WO 98/02527, WO 04/106529, WO 05/20673, WO 03/14357, WO 03/13225, WO 03/14356, WO 04/16073) or imida- zolinones (see e.g. US 6,222,100, WO 01/82685, WO 00/026390, WO 97/41218, WO 98/002526, WO 98/02527, WO 04/106529, WO 05/20673, WO 03/014357, WO 03/13225, WO 03/14356, WO 04/16073); enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) inhibitors, such as glyphosate (see e.g. WO 92/00377); glutamine synthetase (GS) inhibitors, such as glufosinate (see e.g. ΕΡ-Α 242 236, ΕΡ-Α 242 246) or oxynil herbicides (see e.g. US 5,559,024) as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. Several cultivated plants have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by conventional methods of breeding (mutagenesis), e.g. Clearfield® summer rape (Canola, BASF SE, Germany) being tolerant to imidazolinones, e.g. imazamox. Genetic engineering methods have been used to render cultivated plants, such as soybean, cotton, com, beets and rape, tolerant to herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate, some of which are commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady® (glyphosate-tolerant, Monsanto, U.S.A.) and LibertyLink® (glufosinatetolerant, Bayer CropScience, Germany). [00181] Furthermore, plants are also covered that, by the use of recombinant DNA techniques, are capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins, especially those known from the bacterial genus Bacillus, particularly from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as 6-cndotoxins, e.g. CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CrylF, CrylF(a2), CryllA(b), CrylllA, CrylllB(bi) or Cry0c; vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), e.g. VIP1 , VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A; insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonizing nematodes, e.g. Photorhabdus spp. or Xenor-habdus spp.; toxins produced by animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp toxins, or other insect-specific neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such Streptomycetes toxins, plant lectins, such as pea or barley lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibitors, such as trypsin inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin or pa- pain inhibitors; ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-RIP, abrin, luffin, saporin or bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3-hydroxysteroid oxidase, ecdysteroid-IDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases, ecdysone inhibitors or HMG-CoA-reductase; ion channel blockers, such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels; juvenile hormone esterase; diuretic hormone receptors (helicokinin receptors); stilben synthase, bibenzyl synthase, chitinases or glucanases. In the context of the present invention these insecticidal proteins or toxins are to be understood expressly also as pre-toxins, hybrid proteins, truncated or otherwise modified proteins. Hybrid proteins are characterized by a new combination of protein domains, (see, e.g. WO 02/015701 ). Further examples of such toxins or genetically modified plants capable of synthesizing such toxins are disclosed, e.g., in ΕΡ-Α 374 753, WO 93/007278, WO 95/34656, ΕΡ-Α 427 529, ΕΡ-Α 451 878, WO 03/18810 und WO 03/52073. The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, e.g., in the publications mentioned above. These insecticidal proteins contained in the genetically modified plants impart to the plants producing these proteins tolerance to harmful pests from all taxonomic groups of arthropods, especially to beetles (Coleoptera), two-winged insects (Diptera), and moths (Lepidoptera) and to nematodes (Nematoda). Genetically modified plants capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins are, e.g., described in the publications mentioned above, and some of them are commercially available such as YieldGard® (com cultivars producing the CryiAb toxin), YieldGard® Plus (com cultivars producing Cryl Ab and Cry3Bbl toxins), Starlink® (com cultivars producing the Cry9c toxin), Her- culex® RW (com cultivars producing Cry34Abl , Cry35Abl and the enzyme Phosphi- nothricin-N-Acetyltransferase [PAT]); NuCOTN® 33Β (cotton cultivars producing the Cryl Ac toxin), Bollgard® I (cotton cultivars producing the CryiAc toxin), Bollgard® II (cotton cultivars producing CryiAc and Cry2Ab2 toxins); VIPCOT® (cotton cultivars producing a VIPtoxin); NewLeaf® (potato cultivars producing the Cry3A toxin); Bt-Xtra®, NatureGard®, KnockOut®, BiteGard®, Protecta®, Bt 1 1 (e.g. Agrisure® CB) and Btl76 from Syngenta Seeds SAS, France, (com cultivars producing the CryiAb toxin and PAT enyzme), MIR604 from Syngenta Seeds SAS, France (com cultivars producing a modified version of the Cry3A toxin, c.f. WO 03/018810), MON 863 from Monsanto Europe S.A., Belgium (com cultivars producing the Cry3Bbl toxin), IPC 531 from Monsanto Europe S.A., Belgium (cotton cultivars producing a modified version of the CryiAc toxin) and 1507 from Pioneer Overseas Corporation, Belgium (com cultivars producing the Cryl F toxin and PAT enzyme). [00182] Furthermore, plants are also covered that, by the use of recombinant DNA techniques, are capable to synthesize one or more proteins to increase the resistance or tolerance of those plants to bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens. Examples of such proteins are the so-called "pathogenesis-related proteins" (PR proteins, see, e.g. ΕΡ-Α 392225), plant disease resistance genes (e.g. potato cultivars, which express resistance genes acting against Phytophthora infestans derived from the Mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum) or T4-lysozym (e.g. potato cultivars capable of synthesizing these proteins with increased resistance against bacteria such as Erwinia amylvora). The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, e.g., in the publications mentioned above. [00183] Furthermore, plants are also covered that, by the use of recombinant DNA techniques, are capable to synthesize one or more proteins to increase the productivity (e.g. biomass production, grain yield, starch content, oil content or protein content), tolerance to drought, salinity or other growth-limiting environmental factors or tolerance to pests and fungal, bacterial or viral pathogens of those plants. [00184] Furthermore, plants are also covered that, by the use of recombinant DNA techniques, contain a modified amount of substances of content or new substances of content, specifically to improve human or animal nutrition, e.g. oil crops that produce health- promoting long-chain omega-3 fatty acids or unsaturated omega-9 fatty acids (e.g. Nexera® rape, DOW Agro Sciences, Canada). [00185] Furthermore, plants are also covered that, by the use of recombinant DNA techniques, contain a modified amount of substances of content or new substances of content, specifically to improve raw material production, e.g. potatoes that produce increased amounts of amylopectin (e.g. Amflora® potato, BASF SE, Germany).

[00188] The compounds of formula I and compositions thereof, respectively, are also suitable for controlling harmful fungi in the protection of stored products or harvest and in the protection of materials. The term "protection of materials" is to be understood to denote the protection of technical and non-living materials, such as adhesives, glues, wood, paper and paperboard, textiles, leather, paint dispersions, plastics, colling lubricants, fiber or fabrics, against the infestation and destmction by harmful microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria. As to the protection of wood and other materials, the particular attention is paid to the following harmful fungi: Ascomycetes such as Ophiostoma spp., Ceratocystis spp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Sclerophoma spp., Chaetomium spp., Humicola spp., Petriella spp., Trichums spp.; Basidiomycetes such as Coniophora spp., Coriolus spp., Gloeophyllum spp., Lentinus spp., Pleurotus spp., Poria spp., Serpula spp. and Tyromyces spp., Deuteromycetes such as Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium spp., Penicillium spp., Trichorma spp., Altemaria spp., Paecilomyces spp. and Zygomycetes such as Mucor spp., and in addition in the protection of stored products and harvest the following yeast fungi are worthy of note: Candida spp. and Saccharomyces cerevisae. [00189] The compounds of formula I and compositions thereof, respectively, may be used for improving the health of a plant. The invention also relates to a method for improving plant health by treating a plant, its propagation material and/or the locus where the plant is growing or is to grow with an effective amount of compounds of formula I or compositions thereof, respectively. [00190] The term "plant health" is to be understood to denote a condition of the plant and/or its products which is determined by several indicators alone or in combination with each other such as yield (e.g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients), plant vigor (e.g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves ("greening effect")), quality (e.g. improved content or composition of certain ingredients) and tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress. The above identified indicators for the health condition of a plant may be interdependent or may result from each other. [00191] The compounds of formula I can be present in different crystal modifications whose biological activity may differ. They are likewise subject matter of the present invention. [00192] The compounds of formula I are employed as such or in form of compositions by treating the fungi or the plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, soil, surfaces, materials or rooms to be protected from fungal attack with a fungicidally effective amount of the active substances. The application can be carried out both before and after the infection of the plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, soil, surfaces, materials or rooms by the fungi. [00193] Plant propagation materials may be treated with compounds of formula I as such or a composition comprising at least one compound of formula I prophylactically either at or before planting or transplanting. [00194] The invention also relates to agrochemical compositions comprising a solvent or solid carrier and at least one compound of formula I and to the use for controlling harmful fungi. [00195] An agrochemical composition comprises a fungicidally effective amount of a compound I and/or II. The term "effective amount" denotes an amount of the composition or of the compound of formula I, which is sufficient for controlling harmful fungi on cultivated plants or in the protection of materials and which does not result in a substantial damage to the treated plants. Such an amount can vary in a broad range and is dependent on various factors, such as the fungal species to be controlled, the treated cultivated plant or material, the climatic conditions and the specific compound of formula I used. [00196] The compounds of formula I and salts thereof can be converted into customary types of agrochemical compositions, e.g. solutions, emulsions, suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The composition type depends on the particular intended purpose; in each case, it should ensure a fine and uniform distribution of the compound according to the invention. [00197] Examples for composition types are suspensions (SC, OD, FS), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), emulsions (EW, ΕΟ, ES), pastes, pastilles, wettable powders or dusts (WP, SP, SS, WS, DP, DS) or granules (GR, FG, GG, MG), which can be water- soluble or wettable, as well as gel formulations for the treatment of plant propagation materials such as seeds (GF). [00198] Usually the composition types (e.g. SC, OD, FS, EC, WG, SG, WP, SP, SS, WS, GF) are employed diluted. Composition types such as DP, DS, GR, FG, GG and MG are usually used undiluted. [00199] The compositions are prepared in a known manner (cf. US 3,060,084, ΕΡ-Α 707 445 (for liquid concentrates), Browning: "Agglomeration", Chemical Engineering, Dec. 4, 1967, 147-48, Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook, 4th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1963, ρρ. 8-57 et seq., WO 91/13546, US 4,172,714, US 4,144,050, US 3,920,442, US 5,180,587, US 5,232,701 , US 5,208,030, GB 2,095,558, US 3,299,566, Klingman: Weed Control as a Science (J. Wiley & Sons, New York, 1961), Hance et al.: Weed Control Handbook (8th Ed., Blackwell Scientific, Oxford, 1989) and Mollet, Η. and Grubemann, A.: Formulation technology (Wiley VCH Verlag, Weinheim, 2001 ). [00200] The agrochemical compositions may also comprise auxiliaries which are customary in agrochemical compositions. The auxiliaries used depend on the particular application form and active substance, respectively. [00201] Examples for suitable auxiliaries are solvents, solid carriers, dispersants or emulsifiers (such as further solubilizers, protective colloids, surfactants and adhesion agents), organic and inorganic thickeners, bactericides, anti-freezing agents, anti-foaming agents, if appropriate colorants and tackifiers or binders (e.g. for seed treatment formulations).

[00214] The agrochemical compositions generally comprise between 0.01 and 95%, preferably between 0.1 and 90%, most preferably between 0.5 and 90%, by weight of active substance. The active substances are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably from 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).

These compositions can be applied to plant propagation materials, particularly seeds, diluted or undiluted. The compositions in question give, after two-to-tenfold dilution, active substance concentrations of from 0.01 to 60% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 40% by weight, in the ready-to-use preparations. Application can be carried out before or during sowing. Methods for applying or treating agrochemical compounds and compositions thereof, respectively, on to plant propagation material, especially seeds, are known in the art, and include dressing, coating, pelleting, dusting, soaking and in- furrow application methods of the propagation material. In a preferred embodiment, the compounds or the compositions thereof, respectively, are applied on to the plant propagation material by a method such that germination is not induced, e.g. by seed dressing, pelleting, coating and dusting. [00216] In a preferred embodiment, a suspension-type (FS) composition is used for seed treatment. Typcially, a FS composition may comprise 1-800 g/1 of active substance, 1-200 g/1 Surfactant, 0 to 200 g/1 antifreezing agent, 0 to 400 g/1 of binder, 0 to 200 g/1 of a pigment and up to 1 liter of a solvent, preferably water. [00217] The active substances can be used as such or in the form of their compositions, e.g. in the form of directly sprayable solutions, powders, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, dispersions, pastes, dustable products, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading, brushing, immersing or pouring. The application forms depend entirely on the intended purposes; it is intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of the active substances according to the invention. Aqueous application forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such concentrates are suitable for dilution with water. [00218] The active substance concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from 0.001 to 1 % by weight of active substance. [00219] The active substances may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process (ULV), it being possible to apply compositions comprising over 95% by weight of active substance, or even to apply the active substance without additives. [00220] When employed in plant protection, the amounts of active substances applied are, depending on the kind of effect desired, from 0.001 to 2 kg per ha, preferably from 0.005 to 2 kg per ha, more preferably from 0.05 to 0.9 kg per ha, in particular from 0.1 to 0.75 kg per ha. [00221] In treatment of plant propagation materials such as seeds, e.g. by dusting, coating or drenching seed, amounts of active substance of from 0.1 to 1000 g, preferably from 1 to 1000 g, more preferably from 1 to 100 g and most preferably from 5 to 100 g, per 100 kilogram of plant propagation material (preferably seed) are generally required. [00222] When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the amount of active substance applied depends on the kind of application area and on the desired effect. Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are, e.g., 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active substance per cubic meter of treated material. [00223] Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, bactericides, other fungicides and/or pesticides may be added to the active substances or the compositions comprising them, if appropriate not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the compositions according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1 :100 to 100:1 , preferably 1 :10 to 10:1. [00224] Adjuvants which can be used are in particular organic modified polysiloxanes such as Break Thru S 240®; alcohol alkoxylates such as Atplus 245®, Atplus MBA 1303®, Plurafac LF 300® and Lutensol ON 30®; ΕΟ/ΡΟ block polymers, e.g. Pluronic RPE 2035® and Genapol B®; alcohol ethoxylates such as Lutensol ΧΡ 80®; and dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium such as Leophen RA®. [00225] The compositions according to the invention can, in the use form as fungicides, also be present together with other active substances, e.g. with herbicides, insecticides, growth regulators, fungicides or else with fertilizers, as pre-mix or, if appropriate, not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). [00226] Mixing the compounds of formula I or the compositions comprising them in the use form as fungicides with other fungicides results in many cases in an expansion of the fungicidal spectrum of activity being obtained or in a prevention of fungicide resistance development.

[00237] The present invention furthermore relates to agrochemical compositions comprising a mixture of at least one compound of formula I (component 1) and at least one further active substance useful for plant protection, e.g. selected from the groups A) to I) (component 2), in particular one further fungicide, e.g. one or more fungicide from the groups A) to F), as described above, and if desired one suitable solvent or solid carrier. Those mixtures are of particular interest, since many of them at the same application rate show higher efficiencies against harmful fungi. Furthermore, combating harmful fungi with a mixture of compounds of formula I and at least one fungicide from groups A) to F), as described above, is more efficient than combating those fungi with individual compounds of formula I or individual fungicides from groups A) to F). By applying compounds of formula I together with at least one active substance from groups A) to I) a synergistic effect can be obtained, i.e. more than simple addition of the individual effects is obtained (synergistic mixtures). [00238] According to this invention, applying the compounds of formula I together with at least one further active substance is to be understood to denote that at least one compound of formula I and at least one further active substance occur simultaneously at the site of action (i.e. the harmful fungi to be controlled or their habitats such as infected plants, plant propagation materials, particularly seeds, surfaces, materials or the soil as well as plants, plant propagation materials, particularly seeds, soil, surfaces, materials or rooms to be protected from fungal attack) in a fungicidally effective amount. This can be obtained by applying the compounds of formula I and at least one further active substance simultaneously, either jointly (e.g. as tankmix) or separately, or in succession, wherein the time interval between the individual applications is selected to ensure that the active substance applied first still occurs at the site of action in a sufficient amount at the time of application of the further active substance(s). The order of application is not essential for working of the present invention. [00239] In binary mixtures, i.e. compositions according to the invention comprising one compound I (component 1) and one further active substance (component 2), e.g. one active substance from groups A) to I), the weight ratio of component 1 and component 2 generally depends from the properties of the active substances used, usually it is in the range of from 1 TOO to 100:1 , regularly in the range of from 1 :50 to 50:1 , preferably in the range of from 1 :20 to 20:1 , more preferably in the range of from 1 TO to 10:1 and in particular in the range of from 1 :3 to 3:1. [00240] In ternary mixtures, i.e. compositions according to the invention comprising one compound I (component 1 ) and a first further active substance (component 2) and a second further active substance (component 3), e.g. two active substances from groups A) to I), the weight ratio of component 1 and component 2 depends from the properties of the active substances used, preferably it is in the range of from 1:50 to 50:1 and particularly in the range of from 1 :10 to 10:1 , and the weight ratio of component 1 and component 3 preferably is in the range of from 1:5 0 to 5 0:1 and particularly in the range of from 1:10 to 10:1. [00241] The components can be used individually or already partially or completely mixed with one another to prepare the composition according to the invention. It is also possible for them to be packaged and used further as combination composition such as a kit of parts. [00242] In one embodiment of the invention, the kits may include one or more, including all, components that may be used to prepare a subject agrochemical composition. Ε. g., kits may include one or more fungicide component(s) and/or an adjuvant component and/or an insecticide component and/or a growth regulator component and/or a herbicide. One or more of the components may already be combined together or pre-formulated. In those embodiments where more than two components are provided in a kit, the components may already be combined together and as such are packaged in a single container such as a vial, bottle, can, pouch, bag or canister. In other embodiments, two or more components of a kit may be packaged separately, i.e., not pre- formulated. As such, kits may include one or more separate containers such as vials, cans, bottles, pouches, bags or canisters, each container containing a separate component for an agrochemical composition. In both forms, a component of the kit may be applied separately from or together with the further components or as a component of a combination composition according to the invention for preparing the composition according to the invention. [00243] The user applies the composition according to the invention usually from a predosage device, a knapsack sprayer, a spray tank or a spray plane. Here, the agrochemical composition is made up with water and/or buffer to the desired application concentration, it being possible, if appropriate, to add further auxiliaries, and the ready-to-use spray liquor or the agrochemical composition according to the invention is thus obtained. In some embodiments, 50 to 500 liters of the ready-to-use spray liquor are applied per hectare of agricultural useful area. In some embodiments 100 to 400 liters of the ready-to-use spray liquor are applied per hectare. In some embodiments, the invention provides a kit for greenhouse application of a ready-to-use composition of the invention.

In a further embodiment, either individual components of the composition according to the invention or partially premixed components, e.g. components comprising compounds of formula I and/or active substances from the groups A) to I), may be mixed by the user in a spray tank and further auxiliaries and additives may be added, if appropriate (tank mix). [00245] In a further embodiment, either individual components of the composition according to the invention or partially premixed components, e.g. components comprising compounds of formula I and/or active substances from the groups A) to I), can be applied jointly (e.g. after tankmix) or consecutively.

Biol. Chem., 2003, vol. 278, 37099-37111. In some embodiments the assays used are selected from an in vitro ACC enzyme inhibition assays, in vitro cell culture assays, and in vivo efficacy assays in animals. In some embodiments, assay results for compounds of the present invention are compared to results obtained for known inhibitors of ACC or related enzymes. In some embodiments, the ACC inhibitor used for comparison is CP-640186 or soraphen A. [00310] Compounds of the present invention are evaluated in an in vitro ACC inhibition assay as described by Harwood, et al, 2003, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. Example 5 In Vitro Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC) Inhibition Assay [00311] An exemplary procedure for the in vitro ACC inhibition assay, which can be used to determine the inhibitory action of compounds of the invention toward either ACC1 or ACC2, follows. The ADP-Glo™ Kinase Assay kit from Promega is used. The ADP-Glo™ Kinase Assay is a luminescent ADP detection assay to measure enzymatic activity by quantifying the amount of ADP produced during an enzyme reaction. The assay is performed in two steps; first, after the enzyme reaction, an equal volume of ADP-Glo™ Reagent is added to terminate the reaction and deplete the remaining ATP. Second, the Kinase Detection Reagent is added to simultaneously convert ADP to ATP and allow the newly synthesized ATP to be measured using a luciferase/luciferin reaction. Luminescence can be correlated to ADP concentrations by using an ATP-to-ADP conversion curve. The detailed procedure is as follows. 50 pL of the compound being tested (600 uM in DMSO) is added to a 384-well dilution plate. The compound is diluted 1:3 in succession in DMSO for each row for 11 wells. .5 pL ACC2 working solution is added to 384-well white Optiplate assay plate. 0.5 pL diluted compound solution in each column from step 2 is added to the assay plate, each row containing 2 replicates. For the last 2 rows, add 0.5 pL negative control (DMSO) in one row and 0.5 pL positive control (compound 1-97) in the other. The plates are incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. 5 pL substrate working solution is added to each well to initiate reaction. Final ACC2 reaction concentrations consist of: 5 ηΜ ACC2, 20 ρΜ ATP, 20 ρΜ acetyl-CoA, 12 mM NaHC03, 0.01% Brij35, 2 mM DTT, 5% DMSO, test compound concentrations: 30 ρΜ, 10 ρΜ, 3.33 ρΜ, 1.11 ρΜ, 0.37 ρΜ, 0.123 ρΜ, 0.0411 ρΜ, 0.0137 ρΜ, 0.00457 ρΜ, 0.00152 ρΜ, and 0.00051 ρΜ. Plates are incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. 10 pL ADP glo reagent is added. Plates are incubated at room temperature for 40 minutes. 20 pL kinase detection reagent is added. Plates are incubated at room temperature for 40 minutes, then read on a Perkin Elmer EnVision 2104 plate reader for luminescence as Relative Light Units (RLU). [00312] Data for each concentration, as well as the positive and negative controls are averaged, and the standard deviation calculated. Percent inhibition is calculated by the formula: 100 χ (average negative control - compound) / (average negative control - average positive control). The IC50 for each compound is calculated by fitting the data with a non-linear regression equation: Y=Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(l+10A((LogIC50-X)*HillSlope)), where X is the log of compound concentration and Υ is percent inhibition. [00313] In some embodiments, compounds have an IC50 of 5-20 μΜ. In some embodiments, compounds have an IC50 < 5 μΜ. In some embodiments, compounds have an IC50 < 1 μΜ. In some embodiments, compounds have an IC50 <0.1 μΜ. In some embodiments, compounds have an IC50 < 0.01 μΜ. In some embodiments, compounds have an IC50 < 0.001 μΜ. [00314] The results of the in vitro ACC2 inhibition assay are set forth in Table 2. The compound numbers correspond to the compound numbers in Table 1.

[00316] The thermal shift assay tests the ability of compounds of the invention to bind effectively to and elicit a conformational change on the protein resulting in its allosteric inhibition mechanism. Example 7 [14C] Acetate Incorporation Assay [00317] Compounds of the present invention are evaluated in a [14C] Acetate Incorporation Assay. An exemplary procedure for the assay, which measures the incorporation of isotopically labeled acetate into fatty acids, follows. HepG2 cells are maintained in T-75 flasks containing DMEM supplemented with 2mM 1-glutamine, penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin 100pg/ml with 10% FBS and incubated in a humidified incubator with 5% C02 at 37°C. Cells are fed every 2-3 days. On Day 1. cells are seeded in 24 well plates at a density of 1.2 X 105 cells/ml/well with the growth medium. On Day 3 the medium is replaced with fresh medium containingl0% FBS. On Day 4 the medium is replaced with 0.5 ml of fresh medium containing test compound (in DMSO; final [DMSO] is 0.5 %) and the cells are incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. To one copy of plate, 4 ul of [2-14C] acetate (56mCi/mmol; 1 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer) is added and the cells are incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 5 hrs. To a second copy of plate, 4 ul of cold acetate are added and the cells are incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 5 hrs. This plate is used for protein concentration measurement. Medium is removed and placed in a 15 ml centrifuge tube (BD, Falcon/352096). Cells are rinsed with 1ml PBS, then aspirated, and the rinse and aspiration steps are repeated. 0.5ml of 0.1Ν NaOH are added to each well and let sit at RT to dissolve cell monolayer. The remaining cell suspension is pooled with medium. For the protein determination plate, an aliquot is removed for protein determination (25 ul). 1.0 ml of EtOH and 0.17 ml 50% ΚΟΗ are added to tubes containing medium and cell suspensions. Cells are incubated at 90°C for 1 hr, then cooled to room temperature. 5 ml petroleum ether is added per tube, shaken vigorously, centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and 500 uL of the petroleum ether layer is transferred to tubes for Microbeta reading, then 2 ml Aquasol-2 ae added to each tube, the tubes are shaken and counted with a Microbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter (Perkin Elmer). [00318] The remaining petroleum ether layer is discarded and the aqueous phase reserved for fatty acid extractions. The aqueous phase is acidified with 1 ml of concentrated HC1, checking pH of one or two extracts to make sure pH is below 1. 5 ml of petroleum ether is added per tube, shaken vigorously, centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and 4 ml of the petroleum ether layer is transferred to a new glass tube (10*18 mm). 5 ml of petroleum ether is added per tube, shaken vigorously, centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and 5 ml of the petroleum ether layer is transferred to the glass tube, and the extraction repeated again. The petroleum ether extracts are pooled and evaporated to dryness overnight. On Day 5 the residue from the petroleum ether fractions is resuspended in 120 uL of chloroform-hexane (1:1) containing 200 ug of linoleic acid as a carrier. 5 uL of this is spotted onto silica gel sheets, and the plates developed using heptanediethyl ether-acetic acid (90:30:1) as eluent. The fatty acid band is visualized with iodine vapor and the corresponding bands are cut out into scintillation vials. 2 ml of Aquasol-2 is added to each vial, and the vials are shaken and counted on a scintillation counter. [00319] The [14C] Acetate Incorporation Assay illustrates the ability of compounds of the invention to inhibit incorporation of isotopically labeled acetate into fatty acids. In some embodiments, the inhibition occurs with an IC50 of less than 100 ηΜ. Example 8 [00320] Compounds of the present invention are evaluated in an Anti-Fungal Activity Assay. An exemplary procedure for the assay, which measures the susceptibility of various Candida species to anti-fungal compounds, follows. Compounds to be tested (including fluconazole and amphotericin Β) are dissolved in DMSO to obtain a solution having a concentration of 1 mg/mL. These stock solutions are sterile filtered using a 0.22 um nylon syringe filter, then diluted in sterile water to achieve a final concentration of 128 ug/mL. [00321] All species are grown from frozen stock by directly plating on to freshly prepared Sabouraud Dextrose agar (BD, Difco) and incubated overnight in ambient air at 35°C for 24h. A direct suspension is prepared in RPMI 1640 + MOPS (Lonza, Biowhittaker) by taking individual colonies from the overnight cultures using sterile swabs soaked in sterile saline. The concentration of the suspension is determined using pre-determined standard curves. These suspensions are then diluted down to 5 χ 103 CFU/mL to achieve a final concentration of 2.5 χ 103 CFU/mL once added to the microtiter plate as per CLSI guidelines (Μ27-Α3, Vol.28 No.14). [00322] Broth microtiter MIC challenge plates are prepared following CLSI guidelines (Μ27-Α3, Vol. 28 No. 14). The original CLSI guidelines focused on reading Candida MICs after 48h of incubation. As reading after only 24h offers a clear advantage of patient care, QC limits are being established for all drugs at 24h. That being said there are no known interpretive breakpoints for amphotericin Β at 24h and the current fluconazole interpretive breakpoints are based on a 48h reading. The MIC breakpoints for the test compounds are recorded at 48h, and for the soraphen control the 24h time-point is added. All MIC determinations are achieved by visually comparing the growth found in the antibiotic challenged wells to that of the growth control. The first well found in the dilution scheme that shows no growth (or complete inhibition) is recorded as the MIC. [00323] In some embodiments, the Anti-Fungal Activity Assay illustrates that compounds of the invention have anti-fungal activity MICs in the low ug/mL range. Example 9 [00324] Compounds of the invention are also assayed in a Cancer Cell Viability Assay as described by Beckers et al. “Chemical Inhibition of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Induces Growth Arrest and Cytotoxicity Selectively in Cancer Cells” Cancer Res. (2007) 67, 8180-8187. An exemplary procedure for the assay, which measures the percentage of cancer cells surviving following administration of inhibitor compounds, follows. [00325] LNCaP (prostate cancer cell line) cells plated at 4 χ 105 per 6 cm dish are incubated at 37°C, and the following day they are treated with increasing concentrations of inhibitor compounds and incubated. Viable cells and the percentage of dead cells are counted and calculated every day for 5 days from day 0, using trypan blue staining. [00326] In some embodiments, the Cancer Cell Viability Assay shows the ability of compounds of the invention to completely inhibit cell population growth at a concentration of 5 uM. Example 10 [00327] Compounds of the present invention are also assayed in an In Vivo Fatty Acid Synthesis Study as described by Harwood et al. “Isozyme-nonselective N-Substituted Bipiperidylcarboxamide Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Inhibitors Reduce Tissue Malonyl-CoA Concentrations, Inhibit Fatty Acid Synthesis, and Increase Fatty Acid Oxidation in Cultured Cells and in Experimental Animals” Journal of Biological Chemistry (2008) 278, 37099-37111. An exemplary procedure for the assay, which measures the amount of radioactive [C14]-acetate incorporated into rat liver tissue, follows. [00328] Animals given food ad water ad libitum are treated orally at a volume of 1.0 mL/200g body weight (rat) with either an aqueous solution containing 0.5% methylcellulose (vehicle), or an aqueous solution containing 0.5% methylcellulose plus test compound. One to four hours after compound administration, animals receive an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mL of [C14]acetate (64 uCi/mL; 56 uCi/mL). One hour after radiolabeled acetate administration, animals are sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and two 0.75 g liver pieces are removed and saponified at 70 degrees C for 120 minutes in 1.5 mL of 2.5Μ NaOH. After saponification, 2.5 mL of absolute ethanol are added to each sample and the solutions are mixed and allowed to stand overnight. Petroleum ether (4.8 mL) is then added to each sample, and the mixtures are first shaken vigorously for 2 minutes and then centrifuged at 1000 χ g in a benchtop Sorvall for 5 minutes. The resultant petroleum ether layers, which contain non-saponifiable lipids, are removed and discarded. The remaining aqueous layer is acidified to pH < 2 by the addition of 12Μ HC1 and extracted two times with 4.8 mL of petroleum ether. The pooled organic fractions are transferred to liquid scintillation vials, dried under nitrogen, dissolved in 7 mL of Aquasol liquid scintillation fluid, and assessed for radioactivity using a Beckman 6500 liquid scintillation counter. Results are recorded as disintigrations per minute (DPM) per milligram of tissue. [00329] In some embodiments, the In Vivo Fatty Acid Synthesis Study shows that the ED50 of compounds of the invention is less than 0.3 mg/Kg body weight. Example 11 [00330] Compounds of the present invention are also assayed in a Respiratory Quotient Measurement Assay, as described by Harwood et αℓ. “Isozyme-nonselective N-Substituted Bipiperidylcarboxamide Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Inhibitors Reduce Tissue Malonyl-CoA Concentrations, Inhibit Fatty Acid Synthesis, and Increase Fatty Acid Oxidation in Cultured Cells and in Experimental Animals” Journal of Biological Chemistry (2008) 278, 37099-37111. An exemplary procedure for the assay, which measures the ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption in rats, follows. [00331] Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g) housed under standard laboratory conditions, either fed chow, fasted, or fasted and refed a diet high in sucrose for 2 days prior to experimentation are removed from their home cages, weighed, and placed into sealed chambers (43 " 43 " 10 cm) of the calorimeter (one rat per chamber). The chambers are placed in activity monitors. The calorimeter is calibrated before each use, air flow rate is adjusted to 1.6 liters/min, and the system settling and sampling times are set to 60 and 15 s, respectively. Base-line oxygen consumption, CO2 production, and ambulatory activity are measured every 10 min for up to 3 h before treatment. After collecting base-line data, the chambers are opened and rats are given a 1.0-ml oral bolus of either an aqueous 0.5% methylcellulose solution (vehicle control) or an aqueous 0.5% methylcellulose solution containing test compound and then returned to the Oxymax chambers. Measurements are made every 30 min for an additional 3-6 h after dose. Fed vehicle controls are used to assess effects produced by vehicle administration and by drift in the RQ measurement during the course of the experimentation (if any). Overnight-fasted, vehicle-treated controls are used to determine maximal potential RQ reduction. Results are plotted as their absolute RQ value (± SEM) over time. [00332] In some embodiments, the In Vivo Fatty Acid Synthesis Study shows that compounds of the invention decrease RQ to approximately 80-90% of its baseline value, and show dose-dependent decreases in RQ. Example 12 [00333] Compounds of the present invention are also assayed in a propidium iodide (PI) cell death assay, based on the procedure described by van Engeland et αℓ. “A novel assay to measure loss of plasma membrane asymmetry during apoptosis of adherent cells in culture” Cytometry (1996) 24 (2), 131-139. An exemplary procedure for the assay, which measures the number of intact mitotic cells following drug application follows. [00334] Hepatocellular carcinoma cells (such as HepG2 or Η℮ρ3Β) are seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 1.106/ml in 0.5 ml of culture medium, and incubated for 3 hours to allow time for cells to adhere. Cells are treated with experimental compounds, 1 uM doxorubicin (1,2) or vehicle (DMSO) control for 120 hours after treatment, a) First remove culture supernatant into 2mL polypropylene tube and place on ice; b) Wash wells with 0.5mL PBS, transferring the wash volume to the 2mL tube containing culture supernatant (floating cells). Keep cells on ice. Harvest by adding into the wells 200uL of accutase for 5 min. Inactivate with 300uL media. Pipette up and down to mix and transfer trypsinized cells from the well into the 2mL tube with the floating cells (total volume: 1.5mL). Keep cells on ice. Spin cells 0.6 ref for 10 min at 4 degrees. Aspirate medium. Resuspend in 500uL of Media by vortexing in pulses for about 15s. Keep cells on ice. [00335] For cell counting: add 20uF of cells to a plate after vortexing in pulses for 15s. Keep plate on ice. Then add 20uF trypan blue right before counting. Count cells with TC10 biorad cell counter. Spin cells 0.6 ref for 10 min at 4 degrees. Aspirate the medium carefully. Resuspend in 500uF of annexin binding buffer IX by vortexing. Transfer the cell suspension in a 5 ml FACS tube then add 5ul of Propidium Iodide. Gently mix the cells and incubate for 15 min at RT in the dark. [00336] For the flow cytometric analysis, unstained/untreated samples are used at each time point as negative control, and doxorubicin treated samples are used at each time point as a positive control. A FACScan flow cytometer is used, and FL2-A histograms are analyzed with FlowJo software. Example 13 [00337] Compounds of the present invention are also assayed in high fat diet induced obesity (DIO) studies. A representative protocol for the assay follows. [00338] The compounds of the present invention are readily adapted to clinical use as anti-obesity agents, insulin sensitizing agents, hyperinsulinemia-reversing agents, and hepatic steatosis-reversing agents. Such activity is determined by assessing the amount of test compound that reduces body weight and percentage body fat, reduces plasma insulin levels, blunts the rise and/or accelerates the reduction in plasma insulin and glucose levels in response to an oral glucose challenge, and reduces hepatic lipid content relative to a control vehicle without test compound in mammals. Sprague Dawley rats are fed either chow, a diet high in sucrose (for example AIN76A rodent diet; Research diets Inc. Cat #10001) or a diet high in fat (for example Research diets Inc. Cat #12451), for from 3-8 weeks prior to and during test compound administration. [00339] The anti-obesity, insulin sensitizing, hyperinsulinemia-reversing, and hepatic steatosis-reversing potential of compounds of the present invention are demonstrated by evaluating modifications to a variety of parameters of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism using methods based on standard procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example, after a 3-8 week period of ad libitum feeding of either a chow, high-fat, or high-sucrose diet, animals that continue to receive the diet are treated for 1-8 weeks with test compound administered either by oral gavage in water or saline or water or saline containing 0.5% methylcelulose using a Q.D., B.I.D, or T.I.D. dosing regimen. At various times during study and at sacrifice (by CO2 asphyxiation), blood is collected either from the tail vein of an unanesthesized rat or from the vena cava of animals at sacrifice into heparin or EDTA containing tubes for centrifugal separation to prepare plasma. Plasma levels of parameters of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism known by those skilled in the art to be altered coincident with anti-obesity, insulin sensitizing, hyperinsulinemia-reversing, and hepatic steatosis-reversing actions, including but not limited to cholesterol and triglycerides, glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, ketone bodies, free fatty acids, and glycerol, are measured using methods known to those skilled in the art. [00340] The anti-obesity potential of compounds of the present invention can also be demonstrated by evaluating their potential to produce a reduction in body weight, a reduction in percentage body fat (measured by for example dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) analysis), and a reduction in plasma leptin levels. The anti-obesity and hepatic steatosis-reversing potential of compounds of the present invention can also be demonstrated by evaluating their potential to reduce the concentration of triglycerides in the liver, using extraction and quantitation procedures known to those skilled in the art. The insulin sensitizing and hyperinsulinemia-reversing potential of compounds of the present invention can also be demonstrated by evaluating their potential to blunt the rise and/or accelerate the reduction in plasma insulin and glucose levels in response to an oral glucose challenge, using procedures known to those skilled in the art. [00341] The anti-obesity, insulin sensitizing, hyperinsulinemia-reversing, and hepatic steatosis-reversing potential of compounds of the present invention are assayed by administering compounds of the invention once daily by oral gavage in 0.5% methylcellulose in saline at doses of 0, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg to Sprague Dawley rats that have been consuming a high-fat diet for 4 weeks prior to initiation of dosing and continue to consume the same high-fat diet throughout the 2-weeks of test compound administration. In some embodiments compounds of the invention produce a dose-dependent reduction in total body weight relative to vehicle-treated control animals with no concomitant reduction in food consumption. The degree of body weight reduction paralleled plasma drug levels is measured at the end of the study. Plasma leptin levels, which are known to be an indicator of whole-body fat mass and which are increased by administration of the high-fat diet, are reduced by compounds of the invention. The plasma leptin levels for animals receiving the standard chow diet (lean controls) are also evaluated to determine the extent of parameter normalization produced by compounds of the invention. Plasma insulin levels, which are increased by a high-fat diet, are reduced to near lean control levels by compounds of the invention, with no concomitant reduction in plasma glucose levels, indicating an improvement in insulin sensitivity after treatment. Hepatic triglycerides, which are elevated by a high-fat diet, are reduced in a dose-dependent manner after administration of compounds of the invention, and in some embodiments are normalized to lean control levels by the highest dose evaluated. In some embodiments, treatment with compounds of the invention does not increase either liver weight or the markers of liver function, ALT and AST.
