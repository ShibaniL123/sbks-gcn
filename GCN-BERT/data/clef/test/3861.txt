As shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 5, in order to control the driving of a toy car at a remote place and transform the toy car from a car shape into an arbitrary second shape so as to expose the lower surface of an attached arbitrary card when the arbitrary card is attached to the car while the car is traveling, a deformable toy car, according to a first embodiment of the present invention, includes a car 100, a remote control unit 200 and a card 300.

The door frames 106 are members formed as the doors of the car 100 at both side surfaces of the car 100 in the first shape and forming the body of the robot in the second shape at the time of deformation. The rear frame 107 is formed as the rear part of the car 100 at the rear side of the car in the first shape. The deformation part is a constituent element for changing the positions of the fender frames 103, the bonnet frame 104, the roof frame 105 and the door frames 106 for the deformation from the car shape as the first shape into, for example, the robot shape as the second shape, and includes the deformation support 110, the bonnet support 120 and the roof support 130, the link part 140, the fender support 150, the door link parts 160 and the auxiliary wheels 180.

Further, the bonnet support 120 is a plate member formed in the shape of a rectangle and coupled to the bonnet frame 104, wherein the bonnet support 120 is rotationally coupled to one side of the deformation support 110 through the first driving unit 170 such that the bonnet frame 104 can be deformed from the first shape into the second shape. Further, the bonnet support 120 has a through hole 121 formed in the center in the longitudinal direction so as to be penetrated by the link part 140 and the fender support 150, a link part mounting hole 122 formed in the center of one side surface such that the link part 140 is rotationally coupled to the bonnet support 120, and a bonnet frame coupling part 123 for fixing the bonnet frame 104. In addition, a face part 124 is provided on the bottom surface of the bonnet support 120 and has a shape of an arbitrary character face and the like. The roof support 130 is a plate member formed in the shape of a rectangle and coupled to the roof frame 105, wherein the roof support 130 is rotationally coupled to the other side of the deformation support 110 through the roof support mounting hole 111 such that the roof frame 105 can be deformed from the first shape into the second shape. The roof support 130 has link part mounting holes 131 formed at one side, a roof support rotary shaft 132 formed at the other side so as to be rotationally coupled in the roof support mounting hole 111 of the deformation support 110, and door link part coupling holes 133 penetrated to be coupled to the door link parts 160. The link part 140 is a constitutional element for connecting the bonnet support 120 and the roof support 130 such that the roof support 130 carries out rotation operation together with the bonnet support 120 when the bonnet support 120 rotates. The link part 140 has first link rotary shafts 141 formed at one side such that the link part 140 is rotationally coupled in the link part mounting holes 131 of the roof support 130, second link rotary shafts 142 formed at the other side such that the link part 140 is rotationally coupled in the link part mounting hole 122 of the bonnet support 120, and a link insertion part 143 extending a predetermined length from the end portion, on which the second rotary shaft 142 is formed. Further, the link part 140 has link guide parts 144 formed at both sides of the link part 140 in the longitudinal direction such that parts of the door link parts 160 are rotationally coupled to the link guide parts 144. The fender support 150 is a constitutional element connected to the link part 140 at one side and the fender frames 103 at the other side and allows the fender frames 103 to be deformed from the first shape into the second shape as the bonnet support 120 rotates. The fender support 150 has a fender fixing frame 151 having a cross-section in the shape of an approximate "U" at one side so as to fix the fender frames 103, and a link part coupling groove 152 formed on the other side so as to be coupled to the link insertion part 143 of the link part 140 . Each of the door link parts 160 has a door coupling hole 161 coupled to the door frames coupling part 106' of the door frame 106 such that the door frame 106 can be deformed from the first shape into the second shape, a link guide coupling part 162 formed at one side of the door coupling hole 161 and coupled to the link part 140 so as to freely rotate a full 360 degrees with respect to the rotary shaft 162', and a roof support coupling hole 163 provided to the other side so as to be coupled to the roof support 130. That is, if one side of the door link part 160 is coupled to the link guide part 144 through the link guide coupling part 162 and thus an interval between the roof support 130 and the link part 140 is increased or decreased, the link guide coupling part 162 and the roof support coupling hole 163 move closer to or farther from each other. At this time, the door coupling hole 161 moves to a position closer to or farther from the body of the car 100. This movement makes the motion of the door frame 160 looks larger, raising vividness, when the car 100 is deformed from the first shape into the second shape and vice versa. The auxiliary wheels 180 are provided at the lower portion of the lower frame 101 and come into contact with the floor surface such that the car 100 can travel even without the wheels 103', which are provided to the fender frames 103, after the deformation of the car 100 into the second shape. The auxiliary wheels 180 includes auxiliary wheel members 182 and auxiliary wheel supports 181. The driving unit includes the first driving unit 170, the second driving unit 171, the third driving unit 172 and the control circuit part 190. The first driving unit 170 is a constituent element formed as a motor member by using a DC motor, a servo motor, a stepping motor, various reduction gears and the like and provided to the deformation support 110 so as to supply driving force to the bonnet support 120 by the forward or backward rotation operation of the first driving unit 170, wherein the first driving unit 170 is stably fixed to the bonnet support 120 through a rotary shaft support 113. In addition, if the first driving unit 170 is formed using a DC motor, the first driving unit 170 can include a gear means (not shown) such as a reducer and the like. The second driving unit 171 is a constituent element provided to the lower frame 101 and rotates forwards or backwards so as to supply driving force such that the car 100 can travel in a predetermined direction and formed using a DC motor, a servo motor, a stepping motor and the like, wherein the second driving unit 171 is provided with a driving wheel 173. The third driving unit 172 is a constituent element provided to the lower frame 101 and rotating forwards or backwards so as to supply driving force such that the car 100 can travel in a predetermined direction. The third driving unit 172 may be formed using a DC motor, a servo motor, a stepping motor and the like and is provided with another driving wheel 173 . The control circuit part 190 is a constituent element for outputting a traveling control signal to the second and third driving units 171, 172 so as to carry out traveling in an arbitrary direction if an operation control signal is received from the remote control unit 200, 200', and outputting a deformation control signal such that the first driving unit 170 rotates forwards or backwards according to whether a card 300 is attached. The control circuit part 190 includes an RF attached. The control circuit part 190 includes an RF transceiver 191 and a sensor unit 192, a first switch 192a, a second switch 192b, a control unit 193 and a power supply 194. The RF transceiver 191 is a constituent element for transmitting and receiving data signals with respect to the remote control unit 200. The RF transceiver 191 carries out wireless data communications so as to receive a direction-signal provided by the remote control unit 200 and output the same to the control unit 193. The sensor unit 192 is a constituent element provided at the front lower part of the bonnet frame 104 and outputting an on/off-signal according to whether a card 300 is attached. The sensor unit 192 includes a magnet 192' such that the card 300 can be attached and outputs the on/off-signal according to the position of the magnet 192'. That is, the sensor unit 192 can detect an off-state if the magnet 192' maintains an arbitrary position by the elasticity of a spring (not shown) when a card 300 is not attached, while the position of the magnet 192' is changed and the sensor unit 192 can detect an on-state if the magnetic substance included in the card 300 is magnetized by the magnetic force of the magnet 192' such that the card 300 is attached to the magnet 192'. At this time, if the attached card 300 is removed from the magnet 192', the magnet 192' is restored to the original position thereof, that is, to the off-state by the elasticity of the spring. The first switch 192a is a limit switch provided at one side of the deformation support 110 in the horizontal direction, and outputs an on-signal to the control unit 193 so as to finish the operation of the first driving unit 170, when the bonnet support 120 comes to a horizontal state so as to maintain the first shape. That is, the first switch 192a outputs an on-signal if the car has the first shape. The second switch 192b is a limit switch provided at the other side of the deformation support 110 in the vertical direction, and outputs an on-signal to the control unit 193 so as to finish the operation of the first driving unit 170, when the roof support 130 stands in the vertical direction for the deformation into the second shape. That is, the second switch 192b outputs an on-signal if the car comes to the second shape. If the RF transceiver 191 receives an operation control signal from the remote control unit 200, the control unit 193 analyzes the received operation control signal and outputs a traveling control signal to the second and third driving units 171, 172 such that the car 100 travels in an arbitrary direction. In addition, the control unit 193 detects an on/off-signal outputted from the second sensor unit 192 so as to analyze the same. As a result of the analysis, the control unit 193 allows the first driving unit 170 to rotate forwards at a predetermined angle from an arbitrary reference position in the case of an on-signal indicating that a card 300 is attached, while outputs a deformation control signal and allows the first driving unit 170 to rotate backwards at a predetermined angle so as to be restored to the reference position in the case of an off-signal indicating that a card 300 is not attached. Further, if the control unit 193 detects an on-signal from the sensor unit 192 and outputs an operation control signal to the first driving unit 170 so as to carry out deformation from the first shape into the second shape, the control unit 193 outputs the operation control signal to the first driving unit 170 until the first switch 192a outputs an off-signal and the second switch 192b outputs an on-signal, thereby enabling accurate deformation from the first shape into the second shape. Further, if the control unit 193 detects an off-signal from the sensor unit 192 and outputs an operation control signal to the first driving unit 170 so as to carry out deformation from the second shape to the first shape, the control unit 193 outputs the operation control signal to the first driving unit 170 until the second switch 192b outputs an off-signal and the first switch 192a outputs an on-signal, thereby enabling accurate deformation from the second shape to the first shape. The power supply 194 is a constituent element for supplying power for the operation of the car (100) and includes at least one of a primary cell or a secondary cell. The remote control unit 200 is a constituent element for receiving back-and-forth and right-and-left direction control signals inputted by a user such that the car 100 travels in an arbitrary direction, and can be formed using a well-known remote controller. Further, the remote control unit 200 is a communications means between the car 100 and the remote control unit 200 and uses at least one of RF communications, bluetooth communications, Zigbee communications or infrared-ray communications, preferably RF communications using an arbitrary frequency. The card 300 is a rectangular member and has at least one of letters, numbers, figures, pictures, characters and photographs, printed on the outside and an inside part, and a magnetic substance, a core and the like incorporated therein so as to be magnetized as magnetic force is applied thereto. Next, the operation procedure of a transformable toy car according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described in more detail. A user operates the remote control unit 200 such that the car 100 in the first shape as a car towards a card 300 which is spaced from the car 100 at a predetermined distance. The control unit 193 of the car 100 receives the operation control signal from the remote control unit 200, outputs a traveling signal to the second and third driving units 171, 172, and determines whether an on-signal is inputted from the sensor unit 192 . If the card 300 at an arbitrary position is magnetized by the magnet of the sensor unit 192 and attached to the sensor unit 192, the sensor unit 192 outputs an on-signal. If the control unit 193 of the car 100 detects the on-signal of the sensor unit 192, the control unit 193 outputs a deformation control signal to the first driving unit 170 so as to rotate the bonnet support 120 such that the bonnet support 120 stands in the vertical direction. At this time, the roof support 130, which is connected to the bonnet support 120 through the link part 140, stands in the vertical direction together with the bonnet support 120, and the bonnet frame 104 and the roof frame 105, which are coupled to the bonnet support 120 and the roof support 130, also stand in the vertical direction together. In addition, an interval between the roof support 130 and the link part 140 is changed such that the door link parts 160 spread out so as to be arranged in the outward directions. Further, the fender support 150 connected to the link part 140 moves in the upward direction in response to the vertical standing of the bonnet support 120 and accordingly the fender frames 103 coupled to the fender support 150 are changed in position. In addition, as the bonnet support 120 stands, the face part 124 disposed on the bottom surface of the bonnet support 120 is exposed and thus the car 100 is deformed into the second shape. Further, as the bonnet support 120 stands, the sensor unit 192 mounted on the bottom surface of the bonnet support 120 also stands such that the bottom surface of the card 300, which is attached to the magnet 192' of the sensor unit 192, is exposed. Meanwhile, the first driving unit 170 rotates until the second switch 192b, which is mounted on the deformation support 110, outputs an on-signal such that the roof support 130 is fixed at an optimum position, thereby carrying out the accurate deformation into the second shape. After that, if the card 300 is removed from the sensor unit 192, the sensor unit 192 outputs an off-signal. If the control unit 193 detects the off-signal from the sensor unit 192, the control unit 193 outputs a deformation control signal to the first driving unit 170 such that the bonnet support 120 is restored to the original position thereof. At this time, the first driving unit 170 rotates until the first switch 192a, which is mounted on the deformation support 110, outputs an on-signal such that the bonnet support 120 is fixed at an optimum position, thereby carrying out the accurate deformation to the first shape. As the bonnet support 120 is restored to the original position, the roof support 130 interlocked with the link part 140 is restored to the original position thereof, and the fender support 150 and the door link part 160 are also restored to the original positions thereof, such that the car 100 is restored to the car shape as the first shape. (Embodiment 2) Fig. 6 is a perspective view showing a transformable toy car according to a second embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 7 is a block diagram for showing the electric configuration of the transformable toy car according to the second embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, a deformable toy car according to a second embodiment of the present invention includes a car 100', a remote control unit 200' and cards 300a, 300b, 300c differently from that of the first embodiment so as to control the driving of a toy car at a remote place, scan an arbitrary card in the process of traveling of the car, and transform the toy car from a car shape into an arbitrary second shape so as to expose the bottom surface of a predetermined card when the predetermined card is selectively attached to the card. If a control circuit part 190' receives an operation control signal and attachment target card information, which are transmitted from the remote control unit 200', the car 100' carries out traveling operation in an arbitrary direction. If an arbitrary card 300a, 300b, 300c is scanned, the control circuit part 190' compares the scanned card information with the attachment target card information. As a result of the comparison, if the scanned card is an attachment target card, the scanned card is attached to the car 100', and parts of the car body 100', which are rotationally coupled, are deformed from a first shape into a second shape so as to expose the bottom surface of the attachment target card 300a, 300b, 300c. If the attached card 300a, 300b, 300c is removed from the transformed second shape, the deformed parts are restored to the original positions in the first shape. The control circuit part 190' includes a first switch 192a, a second switch 192b, a control unit 193', a local communications unit 195, an RF reader unit 196 and an electromagnet part 197. The first switch 192a is a limit switch provided at one side of the deformation support in the horizontal direction, and outputs an on-signal to the control unit 193' so as to finish the operation of the first driving unit 170, when the bonnet support comes to a horizontal state so as to maintain the first shape. That is, the first switch 192a outputs an on-signal if the car comes to the first shape. The second switch 192b is a limit switch provided at the other side of the deformation support in the vertical direction, and outputs an on-signal to the control unit 193' so as to finish the operation of the first driving unit 170, when the roof support stands in the vertical direction for the deformation into the second shape. That is, the second switch 192b outputs an on-signal if the car comes to the second shape. If the control unit 193' receives an operation control signal and attachment target card information from the remote control unit 200', the control unit 193' outputs a traveling control signal to the second and third driving units 171, 172 such that the car 100' travels in an arbitrary direction. The control unit 193' compares the information on the card 300a, 300b, 300c, which is scanned by the RF reader unit 196, with the received attachment target card information. As a result of the comparison, the control unit 193' outputs an on-signal to the electromagnet part 197 if the scanned card information conforms to the attachment target card information, while outputs an off-signal to the electromagnet part 197 if the scanned card information does not conform to the attachment target card information. Further, the control unit 193 outputs a deformation control signal so as to rotate the first driving unit 170 forwards or backwards so as to control the deformation of the car 100' from the first shape into the second shape and vice versa. Further, if the electromagnet part 197 outputs an on-signal and thus the control unit 193' outputs an operation control signal to the first driving unit 170 so as to carry out the deformation from the first shape into the second shape, the control unit 193' outputs the operation control signal until the first switch 192a outputs an off-signal and the second switch 192b outputs an on-signal, thereby carrying out the accurate deformation from the first shape into the second shape. In addition, if the electromagnet part 197 outputs an off-signal and thus the control unit 193' outputs an operation control signal to the first driving unit 170 so as to carry out the deformation from the second shape to the first shape, the control unit 193' outputs the operation control signal until the second switch 192b outputs an off-signal and the first switch 192a outputs an on-signal, thereby carrying out the accurate deformation from the second shape to the first shape. The local communications unit 195 is a constituent element for transmitting and receiving data signals between the control unit 193' and the remote control unit 200', and uses at least one of RF communications, bluetooth communications, Zigbee communications or infrared-ray communications, preferably the bluetooth communications. The RF reader unit 196 is a constituent element provided at the lower portion of the bonnet frame of the car 100' and scanning information on an arbitrary card 300a, 300b, 300c, which is placed on the floor, so as to provide the scanned information to the control unit 193', wherein the RF reader unit 196 outputs a predetermined electromagnetic wave signal of predetermined output power to the card 300a, 300b, 300c. That is, the RF reader unit 196 detects information which is stored in advance from an RF tag provided to the card 300a, 300b, 300c, (for example, information on the capability of an arbitrary character in a predetermined game, and the like). The electromagnet part 197 selectively generates magnetic force according to the on/off-control signal, which is outputted from the control unit 193', and outputs an on/off-signal according to whether the card 300a, 300b, 300c is attached or not. That is, if the magnetic substance included in the card 300a, 300b, 300c is magnetized by the magnetic force of the electromagnet part 197 and thus the card 300a, 300b, 300c is attached to the electromagnet part 197, the position of the electromagnet part 197 is changed, outputting an on-signal. If the attached card 300a, 300b, 300c is removed from the electromagnet part 197, the electromagnet part 197 is restored to the original position thereof by the elastic force of the spring (not shown) and outputs an off-signal. The remote control unit 200' is a control means for outputting a direction control signal such that the car 100' travels in an arbitrary direction, and receiving the attachment target card information input so as to transmit the same to the car 100'. The remote control unit 200' includes any one of a mobile terminal and a tablet PC, which has a local communications means such as bluetooth and the like, preferably a mobile terminal such as a smart phone and the like. Further, the remote control unit 200' is installed with an executable program for controlling the car 100', the executable program executes a button screen for back-and-forth and right-and-left direction control inputs and an input button screen for inputting attachment target card (300a, 300b, 300c) information, wherein the inputted information is transmitted to the car 100' by using the local communications. The card 300a, 300b, 300c is a rectangular member and has at least one of letters, numbers, figures, pictures, characters and photographs, printed on the outside, and a magnetic substance and an RF tag, installed therein, wherein the RF tag is activated by the electromagnetic waves outputted from the RF reader unit 196 of the car 100'. As the card 300a, 300b, 300c is activated the RF tag transmits the information stored in advance to the RF reader unit 196. Next, the operations of the transformable toy car according to the second embodiment will be described in more detail. First, a bluetooth communications channel is set using pairing between the car 100' and the remote control unit 200', and a user inputs card information for attaching a predetermined card among a first card to a third card 300a, 300b, 300c to the remote control unit 200'. The remote control unit 200' transmits and stores the inputted attachment target card information to the control unit 193' of the car 100'. Then, the control unit 193' outputs a control signal to the second driving unit 171 and the third driving unit 172 such that the car 100' in the first shape can travel in order to attach an attachment target card to the car 100', according to the operation control signal sent through the remote control unit 200' by the user. In addition, the control unit 193' supplies power of a power supply 194 to the RF reader unit 196 so as to detect the information on the attachment target card, and the RF reader unit 196 scans the first card 300a, the second card 300b and the third card 300c according to an arbitrary sequence controlled by the user. The RF reader unit 196 transmits the card information detected by the scanning to the control unit 193'. Therefore, the control unit 193' compares the transmitted information on the first to third cards 300a, 300b, 300c with the stored attachment target card information. If the attachment target card information is detected as a result of the comparison, the control unit 193' supplies power to the electromagnet part 197 such that the electromagnet part 197 generates the magnetic force and the attachment target card is attached to the electromagnet part 197. At this time, if the card is attached to the electromagnet part 197 and thus an on-signal is outputted, the control unit 193' outputs a deformation control signal to the first driving unit 170 so as to deform the toy car from the car shape, that is, the first shape, into the second shape, that is, the robot shape until the second switch 192b outputs an on-signal, thereby carrying out the transformation of the car from the car shape, that is, the first shape to the robot shape, that is, second shape. Further, if the card is removed from the electromagnet part 197 and thus an off-signal is outputted, the control unit 193' outputs a deformation control signal to the first driving unit 170 so as to deform the car from the second shape, that is, the robot shape, to the car shape, that is, the first shape until the first switch 192a outputs an on-signal, thereby carrying out the deformation of the toy car from the robot shape, that is, the second shape, to the car shape, that is, the second shape. Hereinabove, even though the transformable toy car, according to the present invention, is described with reference to the attached drawings, it would be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the invention can be implemented through various modification and changes applied without departing from the technical idea and scope of the present invention as set forth in the accompanying claims. In addition, the thickness of lines, the size of constituent elements and the like illustrated in the drawings in the process of explaining of the embodiments of the present invention may be illustrated exaggeratedly for the sake of clarity and convenience of explanation.
