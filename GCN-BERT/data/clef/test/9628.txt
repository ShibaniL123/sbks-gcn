The present invention relates to the use of a compound as a medicament for the treatment of a patient suffering from an impaired liver function, to the use of a compound as a medicament for the treatment of liver failure, including acute/fulminant or chronic liver failure and/or for increasing the regeneration of liver tissue in a patient. Also, the invention relates to the use of the compound to increase the robustness and regeneration of cultured hepatocytes in vitro to improve cell based therapies, e.g. to a process for cultivating hepatocytes in the presence of the compound, including the use of the cultivated hepatocytes as a transplant, and for hepatocyte transplantation, respectively, into a patient suffering from liver failure. Further, the invention relates to the use of the compound for the production of the medicament, and to the use of hepatocytes cultured in vitro in the presence of the compound for the production of a hepatocyte transplant. Further, the invention relates to a bio-artificial liver comprising cultivated hepatocytes which contain or are contacted by the compound which can be used as a medicament. Further, the invention relates to a process for producing hepatocytes which comprise the compound used as a medicament, and to the use of cultivated hepatocytes being contacted by the medicament for use as a medicament in the treatment of a functionally impaired liver, for the treatment of liver failure, and/or for supporting liver regeneration. Liver failure which can be treated according to the invention includes acute and/or fulminant hepatitis due to infection with hepatotropic viruses, alcohol abuse, obesity, genetic diseases like Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency and related conditions. Liver failure which can be treated according to invention also includes all forms of chronic liver failure with liver cirrhosis induced by e.g. the causes as indicated above. STATE OF THE ART To-date, liver failure is treated by transplantation of a donor liver, however there is a severe shortage of donor organs. WO98/39352, WO99/14226, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,569,575 B2 describe use and synthesis of locked nucleic acids (LNA). OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide a medicament suitable for the treatment of insufficient liver function, e.g. liver failure, and to provide cultivated hepatocytes, which can be kept in culture for use in a bio-artificial liver, e.g. for use in the purification of blood or for transplantation into patients with impaired liver function. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention achieves the objects by the features of the claims, and especially by providing a compound inhibiting or inactivating the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4, also termed MKK4). The nucleotide sequence of the mRNA encoding human MKK4 according to accession No. NMâ€”003010 is given as SEQ ID NO: 1204. Inhibition or inactivation of the activity of MKK4 can be by reduction of the expression of MKK4, e.g. by RNA interference induced by siRNA, especially shRNA or microRNA hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, or by inhibition of MKK4 present in a hepatocyte, e.g. by a kinase-specific inhibitor compound like SP600125, myricitine, Genistein, and PD98059. The invention is based on the finding that the reduction or deletion of active MKK4 in hepatocytes, which can be both cultivated hepatocytes in vitro and hepatocytes of a liver of an animal or human patient, results in increased regeneration of hepatocytes, e.g. in extended cultivation periods and in an increase of regeneration of a damaged or impaired liver in vivo, e.g. in experimental animals after induction of an experimental liver failure representing liver failure in a human patient. It has been found that the reduction or deletion of active MKK4 in hepatocytes can result in an increased proliferative capacity due to an earlier cell cycle entry and in an increased resistance against apoptosis. In summary, contacting hepatocytes in vivo by the compound inhibiting or inactivating MKK4 results in an increased survival of mice in experimental models of liver failure. Further, contacting cultured hepatocytes in vitro by the compound inhibiting or inactivating MKK4 results in extended cultivation periods and in production of cultivated hepatocytes, which can be used as a medicament, e.g. as a transplant, or which can be used as part of a device for the continuous purification of blood withdrawn from and returned to a patient. Inactivation or deletion of MKK4 can be obtained by preventing the expression of functional MKK4 in liver cells, e.g. by inactivating the endogenous gene encoding MKK4, e.g. by insertional mutagenesis of the endogenous gene encoding MKK4, e.g. by inserting a nucleotide sequence comprising at least one nucleotide, for disruption of the endogenous gene encoding MKK4, by preventing translation of the mRNA encoding MKK4, or by pharmacological means, e.g. by contacting hepatocytes in vivo or in vitro by a compound which inhibits the kinase function of MKK4. Preferably, inactivation of MKK4 is obtained by reduction or prevention of expression of MKK4 by administration of an inhibitory RNA through RNA interference (RNAi), which is e.g. an oligonucleotide hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, which inhibitory RNA can e.g. be an siRNA, an shRNA or any form of shRNA contained in a microRNA, e.g. a microRNA based shRNA, an antisense oligonucleotide, or a mixture of these. Preferably, the oligonucleotide hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4 comprises or consists of 19, 21 or 22 nucleotides which are complementary, especially under physiological and cellular conditions, to the mRNA sequence encoding MKK4, and a second section, e.g. an antisense strand, which is complementary in sequence to the first section. From such a double-stranded siRNA molecule, in a cellular environment, the first section is released from the second section and binds to the mRNA encoding MKK4 to induce the degradation of this mRNA or to induce inhibition of translation. Double stranded RNA molecules (siRNAs) which later release one section for mRNA targeting can be directly delivered into livers or liver cells but can also be contained in shRNAs or miRNAs from which the double stranded RNA is later released by enzymatic processing through the cellular RNAi machinery. The sequence of the oligonucleotide hybridising to the mRNA encoding MKK4 to induce its degradation or to prevent its translation can be 100% complementary in sequence as usually is the case with siRNAs or shRNAs, but also can contain mismatches as is often the case with endogenous miRNA, e.g. endogenous miR-15b, miR-24, miR-25, and miR-141, which are also included as compounds for use in the invention, can target MKK4 mRNA with being only partially complementary in sequence. In the description, exemplary oligonucleotide sequences which are hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4 are given, which oligonucleotides can be contained in an siRNA, e.g. as a first section, preferably forming a double-strand with a reverse complementary second section contained in the siRNA. It has been found that inactivation of MKK4 activity, preferably by reduction or inhibition of the expression of MKK4 by presence of an oligonucleotide hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, can be obtained by contacting hepatocytes in vivo or in vitro with at least one oligonucleotide specifically hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4. Contacting in hepatocytes the mRNA which encodes MKK4 can be obtained by administrating to a human or animal patient the RNA hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4 using RNAi through siRNAs by transient in vivo transfection of the siRNA, or alternatively by using, e.g. as a medicament, any means of stable delivery of siRNA, e.g. shRNA, especially microRNA based shRNA or antisense oligonucleotides which are hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, e.g. use of a viral or transposon-based nucleic acid construct which contains an expression cassette encoding the shRNA, for transcription of the shRNA from the expression cassette. The siRNA, or the nucleic acid construct containing an expression cassette encoding the siRNA, is used as a medicament. The nucleic acid construct can e.g. be a viral vector or a transposon-containing nucleic acid construct additionally encoding transposase for integrative stable transduction. Generally, an oligonucleotide hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4 for reducing or preventing the expression of MKK4 in a liver cell is an oligonucleotide having a sequence hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, especially hybridizing to SEQ ID NO: 1204, under physiological conditions, e.g. in the cellular environment of a liver cell. The sequence can be fully complementary, i.e. be reverse complementary to a section of the mRNA of SEQ ID NO: 1204, or the sequence can have mismatches as it often occurs in microRNA mediated inhibition of translation, e.g. the oligonucleotide sequence has a nucleotide sequence of at least 80%, preferably of at least 85%, more preferably of at least 90% or of 95% identity to a reverse complementary section of SEQ ID NO: 1204, including as examples the endogenous miRNAs miR-15b, miR-24, miR-25, and miR-141. Preferred inhibitory oligonucleotides, e.g. shRNA, comprise or consist of one or more of the following oligonucleotides: SEQ ID NO: 1 to SEQ ID NO: 1203. For the design of these sequences the DSIR tool for siRNA and shRNA target design (BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Nov. 30; 7(1):520.) with a score threshold of 70 was used, and therefore all SEQ ID NO: 1 to 1203 have score of at least 70. Inhibitory oligonucleotide sequences, and groups of inhibitory oligonucleotide sequences having higher scores are preferred. The sequences are given in an order of descending score value, e.g. SEQ ID NO: 1 has the highest score (107.1), and SEQ ID NO: 1200, SEQ ID NO: 1201, SEQ ID NO: 1202, and SEQ ID NO: 1203 have the lowest score (70.0 each). SEQ ID NO: 1 to SEQ ID NO: 11 have a score of at least 100, SEQ ID NO: 12 to SEQ ID NO: 55 have a score of at least 95.1, e.g. of 99.8 to 95.1, SEQ ID NO: 56 to SEQ ID NO: 136 have a score of at least 90.0, e.g. of 94.8 to 90.0, SEQ ID NO: 137 to SEQ ID NO: 317 have a score of at least 85, e.g. of 89.9 to 85.0, SEQ ID NO: 318 to SEQ ID NO: 593 have a score of at least 80, e.g. of 84.9 to 80.0, SEQ ID NO: 594 to SEQ ID NO: 915 have a score of at least 75.0, e.g. of 79.9 to 75.0, and SEQ ID NO: 916 to SEQ ID NO: 1203 have a score between 74.9 and 70.0. Further, shRNA or microRNA molecules can comprise one of these oligonucleotides which are complementary to the mRNA encoding MKK4, e.g. comprising one of these oligonucleotides as a first section and a complementary second section in the siRNA as hybridizing sections in a microRNA. The oligonucleotides hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4 for use as a medicament for the regeneration of liver tissue, or for the treatment of liver failure, liver insufficiency and/or liver cirrhosis, can preferably be in the form of RNA, DNA, or hybrids of DNA and RNA, peptide-linkage nucleic acids (PNA), and nucleic acid derivatives containing a ribose moiety with substituents bridging the 2â€²-carbon atom and the 4â€²-carbon atom, e.g. by an oxymethylene group or an aminomethylene group, which derivatives are termed locked nucleic acids (LNA), including further derivatives of the phosphate-sugar backbone, single-stranded, preferably double-stranded, which by intracellular processing by the RNAi enzymatic machinery release a single stranded oligonucleotide for hybridization to the mRNA encoding MKK4. In the alternative to consisting of the use of a nucleic acid sequence hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, e.g. for direct use as a medicament, the inhibitory RNA can be contained as a coding sequence under the control of a promoter in an expression cassette. Depending on the promoter, which can be a constitutive or an inducible promoter, upon introduction into the hepatocyte the inhibitory RNA is produced by transcription. For introduction of nucleic acid constructs reducing or deleting the expression of active MKK4, e.g. nucleic acid constructs which interrupt the endogenous gene encoding MKK4 of a hepatocyte or inhibitory RNA hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, the nucleic acid constructs are preferably provided in the form of one or more oligonucleotides in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier formulation or in the form of a viral vector packaged in a viral particle or in a virus-like particle. A viral vector can be a retroviral, a lentiviral vector, an adeno-associated viral vector, or adenoviral vector. A formulation of the compounds or compositions of the invention for inhibiting or inactivating MKK4 in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can e.g. be in a formulation of lipid nanoparticles (LNP) (as e.g. available from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, USA), a liposome formulation, and/or in a formulation containing a combination with at least one transfection enhancing agent, e.g. lipofectamine and/or as a Calcium complex. In the alternative or in addition to an oligonucleotide having a sequence hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, e.g. an RNAi hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, agents inactivating the activity of MKK4, e.g. agents blocking the function of MKK4 protein, can be used as compounds for use as a medicament according to the invention. Exemplary compounds suitable for inactivating MKK4 are e.g. SP600125, myricitine, Genistein, and PD98059, especially for use as medicaments for the treatment of liver failure, and for the regeneration of liver tissue, respectively. Histologic analysis of mouse livers with stable knock down of MKK4, experimentally generated by transfection with a nucleic acid construct containing an expression cassette for shRNA hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4 showed normal histology. Further, no increase in neoplasms was detected in the experimental animals, indicating that deletion of MKK4 does not augment the risk of cancer development.

Using mice and murine liver tissue and hepatocytes as examples, especially representing human patients and human liver tissue and human hepatocytes, respectively, it was found that liver regeneration could be increased by inactivating MKK4 activity, both in vivo and in cultured hepatocytes. Mice harbouring livers with reduced MKK4 activity show increased regenerative capacity under conditions of liver failure, which also resulted in an increased survival. Inactivation of MKK4 activity could efficiently be achieved by inhibitory RNA present in hepatocytes, in vivo and in vitro, which inhibitory RNA could be generated by transcription from a stably or transiently transfected nucleic acid construct containing an expression cassette encoding at least one RNA which under physiological conditions hybridizes to the mRNA of MKK4. Alternatively, the inhibitory RNA could be introduced, e.g. transfected into hepatocytes in vivo and in culture, e.g. in the form of an siRNA, shRNA or microRNA, preferably in a suitable formulation, e.g. formulated as a liposome preparation or a lipid nanoparticle preparation. In the alternative to the use of inhibitory RNA for use as a medicament for the treatment of liver and hepatocytes, SP600125, myricitine, Genistein, PD98059, 3-(Dimethylamino)-N-[3-[(4-hydroxybenzoyl)-amino]-4-methylphenyl]benzamide (ZM 336372), 2-hydroxy-1-methyl-4-oxo-N-pyridin-4-ylquinoline-3-carboxamide (BAS00525963), 2-(1H-indazol-5-yliminomethyl)-6-nitrophenolate (BAS00697444), 5-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethyl]-7-oxo-N-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxamide (SYN22174524), 5-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethyl]-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-one (SYN22174787), 5-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethyl]-3-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-one (SYN22175977), 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethyl]-2-(methoxymethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-one (SYN22176267), -[2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethyl]-2-(methoxymethyl)-3-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-one (SYN22176367), 5-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethyl]-2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-pyrazolo[5,1-b]pyrimidin-7-ol (SYN22176842), 5-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethyl]-2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-pyrazolo[5,1-b]pyrimidin-7-ol (SYN22176990), 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethyl]-2-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-one (SYN22177890), 5-amino-3-[(Z)-1-cyano-2-[3-[(4-methoxy-6-piperidin-1-yl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)oxy]phenyl]ethenyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyrazole-4-carbonitrile (BAS00896568), 2-(1H-indazol-5-yliminomethyl)-6-methoxy-4-nitrophenolate (BAS00697462), 7-oxobenzo[e]perimidine-4-carboxylic acid (BAS00368055), the further compounds contained in Table 1 given herein, and combinations thereof could be used as medicaments, the presence of which inactivated MKK4 activity at least partially, also resulting in an increase of hepatocyte proliferation, protection against induced apoptosis, and restoration of liver function. These compounds having specific inhibitory activity against MKK4 are also collectively referred to as small inhibitory compounds. Accordingly, both the inhibitory RNA having specificity for the RNA encoding MKK4 and the small inhibitory compounds having specificity for MKK4 protein each inhibit MKK4 and are therefore used as medicaments in the treatment of liver failure and/or for the protection of hepatocytes against apoptosis and/or for the regeneration of hepatocytes. The small inhibitory compounds can be formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation, comprising e.g. buffer substance and carrier substance as well as formulation additives as known to the pharmacist, e.g. for i.v., i.m., intra-liver administration or oral administration. During functional in vitro testing of hepatocytes containing nucleic acid constructs with stable expression of FAH, GFP and shRNA, hepatocytes were isolated from mouse livers and cultivated. It was found that only hepatocytes which were transfected with an expression cassette encoding an inhibitory RNA targeting, i.e. specifically hybridizing with, the mRNA encoding MKK4 could be cultivated for extended periods, e.g. for over 30 days. In addition, these hepatocytes could be trypsinized and replated according to standard methods. Transplantation of primary hepatocytes expressing the shRNA against MKK4 after 1 week in culture into FAH knock-out mice showed the capacity of the hepatocytes in which MKK4 was inactivated to repopulate the liver of these mice and allow survival. In contrast, this result could not be obtained by primary hepatocytes expressing the non-specific control shRNA. This result also indicates that primary hepatocytes expressing the shRNA against MKK4 do not undergo major dedifferentiation during the time of culture. Example 1 Inactivation of MKK4 by Transcription of Inhibitory RNA from an Expression Cassette Integrated into Liver Tissue The introduction of inhibitory RNA into hepatocytes, i.e. into the liver of a patient, for inactivating MKK4 in vivo by expression of the inhibitory RNA from a nucleic acid construct encoding the inhibitory RNA in an expression cassette is shown on the example of mice (C57BL/6) using an expression cassette encoding the inhibitory RNA for production of the shRNA hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4. The promoter controlling transcription of the inhibitory RNA was constitutive. In short, homozygous FAH-negative mice (FAH âˆ’/âˆ’) were kept with constant administration of NTBC in order to block the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase which would otherwise lead to the accumulation of toxic metabolites in the liver. As inhibitory RNA, SEQ ID NO: 1 or, alternatively, SEQ ID NO: 2 was used, both of which hybridize with the mRNA encoding MKK4. Each inhibitory RNA was introduced by contacting the liver cells in vivo with nucleic acid constructs with transposase-specific inverted repeat sections (IR) on both termini, containing an expression cassette for FAH for complementation of the FAH âˆ’/âˆ’ genotype upon expression, by hydrodynamic tail vein injection in combination with a second nucleic acid construct encoding transposase sleeping beauty 13 (SB 13) under the control of the PGK promoter. The nucleic acid constructs are shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 2 schematically shows the steps of the genetic manipulation. A first control construct p/T-FAHIG contains the complementing FAH expression cassette and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression cassette comprising the GFP encoding sequence under the control of an IRES element, but encodes no inhibitory RNA. A sequence encoding an inhibitory RNA with no target as a control, which in addition to the GFP expression cassette in 3â€² to the GFP encoding sequence encodes a microRNA was contained in the construct p/T-FAHIG-shCtr. A sequence encoding an inhibitory RNA according to the invention was contained in construct p/T-FAHIG-shMKK4, which in addition to the GFP expression cassette in 3â€² to the GFP encoding sequence encodes a microRNA (depicted as a loop) comprising an shRNA as an example for an inhibitory RNA. In the example, SEQ ID NO: 1, alternatively SEQ ID NO: 2 was used as a preferred representative of inhibitory RNA sequences. Following introduction of the nucleic acid constructs, mice were kept in the absence of NTBC for selecting animals having complemented hepatocytes. In cotransfected cells, the transient expression of SB13 leads to the stable integration of the expression cassette in the genome. Analyses of mice after introduction of the nucleic acid constructs confirmed stable transcription of the inhibitory RNA from the nucleic acid construct. In detail, analysis of body weight of mice of FIG. 3 shows that the animals having received the control construct p/T-FAHIG (5) as well as the animals having received the control construct p/T-FAHIG-shCtr. (1), which expresses a non-specific RNA could not reconstitute liver function effectively but died. Animals of those groups having received a nucleic acid construct containing an expression cassette for an inhibitory RNA which is specific for SEQ ID NO: 1, namely p/T-FAHIG-shMKK4.A (2, 4) and p/T-FAHIG-shMKK4.B (3) could reconstitute liver function, as shown by the survival and restoration of body weights. This result is further supported by FIG. 4 showing livers explanted at day 20 after administration of the nucleic acid construct, where livers are in the process of repopulation by hepatocytes which were co-transfected in vivo with a nucleic acid construct containing an expression cassette for FAH and GFP and including an expression cassette for inhibitory RNA specific for mRNA encoding MKK4 (p/T-FAHIG-shMKK4, both left-hand pictures), or including an expression cassette encoding a non-specific inhibitory RNA (p/T-FAHIG-shCtr, both right-hand pictures). The explanted livers of FIG. 4 show a faster increase of GFP fluorescence over time in vivo from animals co-transfected with the nucleic acid construct which includes the expression cassette encoding an inhibitory RNA specific for the mRNA encoding MKK4 compared to animals co-transfected with the nucleic acid construct which includes the expression cassette encoding an inhibitory RNA with no target. The result from fluorescence is confirmed in this case in fully repopulated mouse livers by the immunospecific staining for MKK4 in the Western blot shown in FIG. 5 and by the immunofluorescence analyses for expression of MKK4 in the tissue samples of explanted mouse livers which are shown in FIG. 6. In FIG. 5, shMKK4-224 denotes protein extracts from mouse livers repopulated with an expression cassette encoding an inhibitory RNA against MKK4 and shMKK4-3553 denotes protein extracts from mouse livers repopulated with an expression cassette encoding an independent inhibitory RNA against MKK4; tubulin served as a loading control and was detected by a specific antibody (Î±-tub), MKK4 was detected by an anti-MKK4 antibody (Î±-MKK4). In FIG. 6, FAHIG-shCtr denotes a nucleic acid construct containing the expression cassette for the complementing FAH and for GFP, including a non-specific inhibitory RNA (shCtr). shMKK4-A and shMKK4-B denote nucleic acid constructs containing expression cassettes for shRNA which specifically hybridize to the mRNA of MKK4. Both analyses show that only the nucleic acid construct which includes an expression cassette encoding an inhibitory RNA specific for the mRNA encoding MKK4 results in a decrease of MKK4 expression in hepatocytes. FIG. 7 shows Western blots for cyclin A and E of nuclear extracts from the mouse livers contacted with the nucleic acid construct expressing the shRNA hybridizing to MKK4 mRNA (shMKK4, +) and expressing the non-specific shRNA (shCtr, +), respectively, at 0, at 24 h, at 38 h, and at 48 h after partial hepatectomy, detected with Î±-cyclin A antibody (Î±-Cyc.A) and Î±-cyclin B antibody (Î±-Cyc.B). This analysis shows that inactivation of MKK4, which is e.g. obtained by the expression of an inhibitory RNA hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, leads to an earlier entry of the cell cycle after partial hepatectomy. FIG. 8 shows a Ki67 stain of livers of the experimental animals having received the nucleic acid construct expressing the inhibitory RNA specific for MKK4 mRNA (shMKK4) and of animals having received the construct expressing the non-specific shRNA (shCtr), respectively, at 0 h, 38 h, and 48 h following partial hepatectomy. The analyses show that the inactivation of MKK4, which in the example is obtained by presence of the shRNA which is specific for MKK4 mRNA and is expressed from the nucleic acid construct introduced into the hepatocytes results in an increase of hepatocyte proliferation in vivo. FIG. 9 shows a quantification of the Ki67-positive cells from the analyses of FIG. 8. The increase in hepatocyte proliferation for the hepatocytes containing the shRNA inhibiting expression of MKK4 (p/t-FAHIG-shMKK4) is significant in comparison to the non-specific shRNA control (p/t-FAHIG-shCtr). FIG. 10 shows TUNEL staining for identification of apoptotic cells in liver tissue from mice transfected by an integrating nucleic acid construct containing an expression cassette for non-specific shRNA (shCtr.), or an expression cassette for shRNA which specifically hybridizes to mRNA of MKK4 (shMKK4.224 or shMKK4.355, each expressing a mouse-specific siRNA hybridizing to the RNA of MKK4). Apoptosis was induced in vivo at 9 h prior to the analysis experimentally by injection of Jo2 antibody, which interacts with CD95 to induce fulminant liver failure. TUNEL staining reveals less apoptotic hepatocytes in the liver tissue expressing the MKK4-specific shRNA (shMKK4.224, shMKK4.355) than in controls (shCtr.). The upper row of pictures shows fluorescence micrographs of TUNEL analyses, the lower row shows bright field micrographs of H&E stained tissue samples. The quantification of TUNEL analysis following induction of liver failure is shown in FIG. 11, demonstrating a significantly lower number of apoptotic hepatocytes in those liver tissues containing the shRNA (shMKK4.224 and shMKK4.3553) that hybridizes to mRNA of MKK4 when compared to the control with non-specific shRNA (shCtr.). FIG. 12 shows the survival rate according to Kaplan Meier of mice transfected with the nucleic acid construct expressing the shRNA hybridizing to mRNA of MKK4 (shMKK4.224 and shMKK4.3553) and of control mice (shCtr.) after the experimental induction of liver failure. The result demonstrates that inactivation of MKK4, which inactivation in the example is obtained by expression of an inhibitory RNA (shRNA) from an expression cassette of a nucleic acid construct, effectively protects hepatocytes in vivo against apoptosis. Example 2 Inhibition of MKK4 In vivo by Transcription of Inhibitory RNA from an Expression Cassette Encoding shRNA For transient transfection of hepatocytes, a nucleic acid construct containing or consisting of an expression cassette encoding an inhibitory RNA which specifically hybridizes to the mRNA encoding MKK4, e.g. containing SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 (which are both specific for the human and the mouse mRNA of MKK4) was transiently introduced into hepatocytes. For transient transfection in vivo, the nucleic acid construct was formulated in liposomes and administered to the experimental animals. The liposome formulation contained the lipids 3-N-[(qmethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)2000)carbamoyl]-1,2-dimyristyloxy-propylamine (PEG-C-DMA), 1,2-dilinoleyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane (DLinDMA), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and cholesterol, in a 2:40:10:48 molar per cent ratio. The effect of increasing proliferation of hepatocytes, protection against induction of apoptosis could be shown as laid out for the stable expression of the shRNA in Example 1, indicating that the effect was limited to the period in which the shRNA was present in the hepatocytes using the analytical methods as described in Example 1. This shows that MKK4 activity can effectively be inhibited or inactivated by transient expression of inhibitory RNA, e.g. shRNA or microRNA, from an expression cassette of a nucleic acid construct which does not integrate into the hepatocyte. Example 3 Inhibition of MKK4 In vivo by Inhibitory RNA Transfected into Hepatocytes Suitability of inhibitory RNA for use as a medicament could be shown by transfecting the inhibitory RNA which specifically hybridizes to mRNA of MKK4 into liver tissue in vivo. Inhibitory RNA could be shRNA or microRNA, preferably formulated as liposomes or lipid nanoparticles. Generally, reduction or elimination of MKK4 could be obtained in at least a fraction of the liver tissue contacted by the formulation of the inhibitory RNA using the analytical methods as described in Example 1. This shows that inhibitory RNA specific for mRNA of MKK4 can be used as a medicament, especially for the treatment of impaired liver function. Example 4 Inhibition of MKK4 In vivo by SP600125, Myricitine, Genistein, or PD98059 in Hepatocytes In the alternative to inhibition of MKK4 activity in liver tissue by inhibitory RNA, SP600125, myricitine, Genistein, or PD98059 were used for inactivating MKK4 in the liver. Generally, SP600125, myricitine, Genistein, or PD98059 were administered to mice at a dosage efficient for in vivo inactivation of MKK4. Preferably, the dosage was efficient to inactivate at least 80%, more preferably at least 90 or 95% of mean in vivo MKK4 activity. It could be found that the inactivation of MKK4 in the liver by administration of SP600125, myricitine, Genistein, or PD98059 as a medicament resulted in a significant increase in liver regeneration, an increase in proliferation, and in protection against induced apoptosis using the analytical methods as described in Example 1. Example 5 Inhibition of MKK4 in Primary Hepatocytes Cultured In vitro by Stable or Transient Transcription of Inhibitory RNA from an Expression Cassette Encoding shRNA For in vitro transfection, cultured primary hepatocytes obtained from experimental animals were contacted by the nucleic acid construct as described in Example 1 or 2. Generally, the nucleic acid construct could be formulated as liposomes according to Example 2. Generally, stable or transient expression of the inhibitory RNA could be obtained in the cultured hepatocytes, and reduction or elimination of MKK4 could be detected using the analytical methods as described in Example 1. For experimental purposes, in the alternative to in vitro transfection of primary hepatocytes originating from an experimental animal, stably transfected hepatocytes expressing shRNA specific for MKK4 mRNA were isolated from the experimental mice generated according to Example 1. Analysis of cultured hepatocytes was by quantification of the incorporation of EdU by primary hepatocytes by flow cytometry. The result of cultivated transfected hepatocytes after 3 days culture is shown in FIG. 13. The inset phase contrast micrographs and the relation of hepatocytes containing shRNA specific for mRNA of MKK4, generated by expression from the transfected expression cassette, show that cultured hepatocytes with inactivated MKK4 (FAHIG-shMKK4) show a drastically improved EdU incorporation as a marker for proliferation over controls (FAHIG-shCtr) without inhibition of MKK4 activity in culture. Replating of the cultured hepatocytes in fresh culture medium shows the increased long-term survival of cultured hepatocytes in which MKK4 activity is essentially inhibited, e.g. by presence of inhibitory RNA (shMKK4) that specifically hybridizes to mRNA of MKK4, as shown in the micrographs of FIG. 14. Hepatocytes with inactivated MKK4 (shMKK4) can be cultured effectively at least to day 29 (d29), and can be cultured by trypsinizing and replating to fresh medium at day 15; right-hand micrographs show day 3 of cells replated after 15 days initial culture. In contrast, transfected cells with a non-specific shRNA (shCtr) show a lower long term survival in culture and no growth upon replating after 15 days initial culture. These results show that the inactivation of MKK4 activity drastically increases long term survival and replating efficiency of cultured hepatocytes. Generally, the generally known Eagles medium was used for hepatocyte cultures. Example 6 Cultured Hepatocytes with Inactivated MKK4 Activity for Use as a Medicament for Liver Regeneration Hepatocytes from a mouse representing a patient having a compatible or identical blood group, preferably hepatocytes that were immunologically compatible with a later recipient, e.g. a patient, preferably autologous hepatocytes, were cultured. MKK4 activity was inhibited as described in the above Examples, preferably by transfection of cultured hepatocytes with a nucleic acid construct containing an expression cassette for an inhibitory RNA hybridizing to the mRNA encoding MKK4, by transfection with an inhibitory RNA, preferably repeatedly, or by contacting with SP600125, myricitine, Genistein, or PD98059. Cultured mouse hepatocytes which were stably transfected with a nucleic acid construct expressing the complementing FAH and GFP (FAHIG) and an inhibitory RNA specific for the mRNA encoding MKK4 or a non-specific shRNA (Ctrl), respectively, were harvested by trypsinizing. These hepatocytes were suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and transplanted into the spleen or liver of FAH âˆ’/âˆ’ mice, which subsequently were kept without NTBC. The Kaplan Meier analysis of survival after intraspleenic transplantation of the cultured hepatocytes is shown in FIG. 15. In comparison to mice having received hepatocytes containing the non-specific shRNA (shRNA.Ctrl) that die at day 37-38 (vertical line), mice having received hepatocytes containing shRNA Mkk4 specific for the mRNA of MKK4 by expression from the expression cassette encoding the shRNA have a drastically increased survival. The experimental FAH âˆ’/âˆ’ mice that had repopulated livers with hepatocytes with an expression cassette for GFP, including the shRNA specific for the mRNA encoding MKK4 (shRNA.MKK4) were kept for 12 months following repopulation. Analyses of explanted livers in bright field photography (Bright), with GFP imaging (GFP) (left-hand pictures of FIG. 16) and anti-FAH immunofluorescence and H&E staining of liver sections (right-hand pictures of FIG. 16) show no tumor development with stable intrahepatic expression of GFP and of the shRNA specifically inactivating MKK4. These data emphasize that MKK4 inhibition can be used to increase regeneration without triggering tumor growth. Example 7 Cultivated Hepatocytes with Inactivated MKK4 Activity for Use as a Device for Extracorporal Blood Purification Cultured hepatocytes obtained as described above, preferably by cultivating primary hepatocytes which were stably transfected with a nucleic acid construct expressing an shRNA specific for the mRNA encoding MKK4 were grown on a carrier substrate, e.g. a polymer carrier. The cultured hepatocytes adhering to the carrier substrate were arranged in a container which was perfused with blood withdrawn from a patient, exemplified by a mouse or rat. Blood exiting the container could immediately be returned into the patient. In initial experiments, it could be shown that hepatocytes which are genetically manipulated to stably express an shRNA inactivating the mRNA encoding MKK4 are stable when grown on a carrier substrate, and that these cultures hepatocytes could be used as a blood purification device. Example 8 Inactivation of MKK4 in In vitro Analyses The inhibitory effect of compounds against MKK4 was analysed in an in vitro assay using purified MKK4 protein, e.g. obtained from a cell line that was genetically manipulated to over-express MKK4 from an expression cassette containing the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO: 1204 as a coding sequence and affinity purification using e.g. an antibody directed against MKK4 protein. In the assay, purified active MKK4 protein was incubated with its substrate JNK1a1 and 32P-labelled gATP (5 Î¼Ci, approx. 10 Î¼M), without additional active compound, with the small inhibitory compound, or with Genistein as a positive control. For the assay, kinase assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5; 10 mM MgCl2; 1 mg/ml BSA; 1 mM Na3VO4; 1 mM DTT) was used. An inhibitory effect of the small inhibitory compound (final concentration 50 Î¼M) was detected as a reduction of the phosphorylation activity of MKK4 protein on its substrate JNK1a1 by measuring the amount of radioactive (32P) phosphate in JNK1a1. Phosphorylation of JNK1a1 was measured in the presence of 2 ml scintillation cocktail per sample by using a scintillation counter (Wallac, Liquid Scintillation Counter). In this assay, Genistein gave an inhibition to approx. 80% activity compared to the assay without additional active compound.
