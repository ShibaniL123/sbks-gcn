Attached Growth Media Element The present invention relates to the field of water treatment. More specifically, the present invention relates to attached growth media, and in particular provides an improved attached growth media element, and filters employing such attached growth media elements, suitable for use in the treatment of contaminated water, wastewater, potable water, industrial water as well as polluted water bodies. Background to the invention Attached growth processes are well known in the field of water treatment. Attached growth refers to the presence of waste-consuming bacteria and/or other organisms that (in contrast to activated sludge processes where the waste-consuming bacteria grow in suspension) are attached to a natural or artificial surface; the medium. Attached growth processes can include breakdown and metabolism of organic matter, transformation, stabilisation, and removal of nutrients and chemicals as well as reduction of pathogens among other treatment processes. As the bacteria and/or attached organisms break down the organic matter a biologically active film is formed on the media. Eventually, as the biological film grows, portions of it slough off of the supporting surface to be replaced with a new film. This sloughing is a necessary part of the process in order to maintain aerobic conditions and allow water to flow through. If the media is allowed to clog then anaerobic conditions may develop. One advantage of attached growth media systems is that the beneficial biological organisms remain relatively stable and are less subject to washing out, as can happen in suspended growth treatment processes. Typical attached growth media may comprise natural elements such as gravel, sand, rocks, peat or plant roots, or artificial elements such as textiles (woven or non-woven sheets or strips), engineered plastic balls, beads, chips, wafers, foam pieces etc. However, known attached growth media and systems employing such known attached growth media suffer from a number of disadvantages that limit their effectiveness. It is therefore an object of embodiments of the present invention to obviate or mitigate one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art. For example, it is an object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide an attached growth media element that may provide high media surface area densities. It is an additional object of such embodiments to achieve same while reducing instances of clogging. It is also an object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide an attached growth media element that attracts a diverse range of attached growth organisms. It is another object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide an attached growth media system that is suitable for deployment in challenging applications such as high flow, suspended trash and solids, shock loads and complex pollution constituents. It is another object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide an attached growth media system that may be added to an existing treatment works, without the requirement for additional apparatus. Finally, it is a yet further object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide a filter capable of operating with varying attached growth media densities. Summary of the invention According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an attached growth media element according to claim 1. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an attached growth media system according to claim 28. According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of treating a body of water according to claim 36. Other preferred features of the invention are outlined in the dependent claims. Brief description of the drawings There will now be described, by way of example only, various embodiments of the invention with reference to the drawings, of which: Figure 1 provides a side view of an attached growth media element in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention; Figure 2 provides a top-down view of the attached growth media element shown in Figure 1; Figure 3 provides a side view of two attached growth media elements; Figure 4 provides a side view of an attached growth media element in accordance with a further alternative embodiment of the present invention; Figure 5 provides a side view of a plurality of attached growth media elements within a flowing body of water; Figure 6 provides a side view of a closely spaced arrangement of attached growth media elements providing a filter curtain; and Figure 7 provides a cross-sectional schematic side view of an attached growth media system in accordance with a yet further alternative embodiment of the present invention, shown in (a) a first configuration in which the elements are spaced and (b) a second configuration in which the elements are compressed. For the avoidance of doubt, the attached growth media elements illustrated in Figure 3 are outside the scope of the invention. Detailed description of preferred embodiments Figure 1 provides a side view of an attached growth media element 1 which can be seen to comprise an elongate central member or core 3 upon which are disposed a number of filaments 5. These filaments 5 comprise the attached growth media and are arranged, in this embodiment, in a pair of helical arrangements 7,9 that extend along the length of the elongate central member 3. (It will be readily understood that a single helical arrangement or indeed three or more helical arrangements may be employed without deviating from the scope of protection defined by the appended claims). The filaments 5 are fixed to the elongate central member 3 at a first end 11, and are free at the opposite end 13 (more clearly visible in the top-down view of Figure 2). This allows small suspended detritus, dead biomass or waste material to freely slide off the loose end, a.k.a. sloughing, preventing entanglement or fouling by rubbish or filamentarous detritus materials which is a particular problem with attached growth media systems of the prior art. Thus the attached growth media element 1 is provided with a self-cleaning mechanism. In addition, the filamentary nature of the attached growth media 5, being for example non-woven and non-branching, allows for high attached growth media densities without risk of clogging with solids. The filaments 5 can be affixed to the elongate central member 3 by a variety of suitable means. For example, they may be affixed by means of direct binding or winding within two or more twisted core elements or by waterproof adhesives. The filaments 5 may be made of long lasting materials of substantially neutral buoyancy, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon or polyester for example. As evident in Figure 2, the filaments 5 are denser proximal 11 to the elongate central member 3, and less dense at their distal ends 13. This provides a range of media density that in turn provides an important diversity of biological growth environments. For example, more robust and aerobic organisms may favour the distal 13 (i.e. less dense) ends of the filaments 5 and more delicate organisms may favour the inner 11 more protected and more densely packed ends of the filaments 5. This feature presents the opportunity for autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms and dependent water treatment process to occur and take place simultaneously in close proximity within each media element 1 and any system in which such elements are employed. The helical arrangement prevents the attached growth media filaments 5 from forming bunches that would reduce the flow through and porosity of the media, and allows a high flow throughput of water. Similarly, the helical arrangement avoids the undesirable warp & weft effect of woven media which can also constrict the flow of water reducing the amount of contact surface area between attached growth organisms and the water being treated. It is envisaged that the helical arrangements may also include sections or strips of impermeable membrane, geotextile, or plastic mesh to enhance the form, structure and surface area of the media, and/or complement the helical arrangement. Individual filaments 5 may be comprised of single strands (as illustrated) or crimped lengths of continuous filament (not shown). Advantageously, the filaments 5 are provided with a textured surface area to assist in the adhesion and growth of attached growth organisms. As stated above, the filaments 5 are affixed to the core in a helical arrangement, conducive to even distribution of attached growth and at all sides, and a consistent friction and self-cleaning effect (see below) throughout the element 1. This configuration allows very high surface areas to be possible (for example, ranging from 100 m2/m3 up to over 1000 m2/m3). The elongate central member 3 of this embodiment is semi-rigid, i.e. flexible and/or resilient, and thus provides a predetermined range of mobility without causing entanglement of filaments 5. The elongate central member 3 advantageously has a lateral/horizontal flexibility ratio under design flow velocities of 15% to 50% of its overall length. It is envisaged that elements 1 according to the invention may have an effective length ranging from a fraction of a meter up to and greater than five meters. As the length of the element increases the diameter of the central member 3 generally increases to maintain a desired flexibility ratio. Central member 3 materials may typically be metallic, poly, or acrylic, or glass re-enforced plastic or other non-soluble durable material. The central member 3 may be constructed of a single or multiple core materials, to achieve the desired flexibility and/or resilience. When disposed in an array, individual media elements 1 in the array will come in to contact with neighbouring elements in which case they may bend; however the resilience of the central member 3 prevents the elements from wrapping around each other. In this way a continuous movement in the media may be accommodated without the risk of entanglement. The flexibility of the central member 3 may allow the element to be both strong and light, and able to cope with high flow velocities, such as may be found in an open water system or variable flow water treatment facilities. Thus, problems associated with prior art attached growth media elements (such as those incorporating sheets or strips of textiles or curtains which can become entangled or tear; or plastic pellets, wafers or balls, which are prone to media loss) are overcome. The attached growth media element 1 is also provided with a connection means 15 by which it can be suspended from a structure to which it is connected (for example an attached growth media system as shown in Figure 7 and described below). In this case, the connection means 15 comprises a swivelling top piece which allows the media element 1 to rotate and pivot within a hemispherical zone of possible movement (a 2π solid angle) with respect to the connection point. That the element 1 is thereby provided with freedom to move presents an additional benefit where faster currents can be experienced, for example in open water bioremediation applications and/or in seasonal storm events. High flows rates have posed significant problems for attached growth media systems of the prior art which may experience tearing, tangling and dispersion of media and system and media components. To overcome these problems, the flexibility and freedom of movement provided by the fixing method of this embodiment of the present invention allows increased velocity flows (for example > 3m/second) to displace the elements 1 (see Figure 5 for example in which fluid flow A displaces a plurality of like elements 1). If the current is sufficiently strong, the elements 1 may become substantially parallel to the flow, effectively folding them upwards and out of the way. This for example would allow surge flows to pass smoothly under the array of folded up elements 1 with limited drag resistance and minimal risk of damage to the elements 1 and the media comprised therein. Similarly in high flow instances, the flexible attached media members 5 are swept in to a stream lined configuration, allowing currents to pass by and detritus to brush off easily The combination of a flexible/resilient central member 3, movement of the element 1 as a whole and flexibility of individual growth media filaments 5 provide variable and dynamic conditions which resemble natural filtration forms. These features prevent the system from clogging or fouling. It is known that sloughed solids can present a considerable challenge for attached growth media systems, however the flexibility and movement possible in this embodiment of the present invention allows a continuous gentle self-cleaning process as the media filaments 5 and elements 1 themselves may sway in a current and brush against each other (filaments against neighbouring filaments and elements against neighbouring elements) by which action accumulated solids are loosened and dead attached growth organisms can be brushed free in a continual process of gentle cleaning and renewal of the attached growth media. As each media element 1 is affixed solely at the top (or solely at the bottom), as the element 1 swivels, rotates or otherwise moves about the connection means 15, any large suspended detritus or waste materials that might otherwise become lodged in the element 1 can freely brush off of the end of the media element 1 as it moves in the water. A weighted end piece 17 helps maintain a vertical orientation of the media element 1 when suspended, and provides a degree of resistance to displacement of the media element 1 when situated in a moving body of water. An alternative arrangement is illustrated in Figure 3 (like reference numerals indicating like features) which is outside the scope of the invention. The attached growth media element 101 can be seen to comprise an elongate central member or core 103 upon which are disposed a number of leaves 105. These leaves 105 comprise the attached growth media and as per the previous embodiment are arranged in a pair of helical arrangements 107,109 that extend along the length of the elongate central member 103. The leaves 105 are in contrast to the filaments 5 of the previously described embodiment. The provision of leaves 105, being flattened and having a larger surface area per individual element, than the corresponding filaments 5, lend themselves particularly to providing continuous helical flow paths (indicated generally by arrows Β) along the length of the element 101 (although it will be understood that such flow paths are possible with the previously described embodiment). The flow paths Β provide a means by which air can be communicated from the bottom of the element 101 to the top, thereby providing an air supply to substantially all of the attached growth provided upon the element 101. In use, air bubbles may rise up through the attached growth media in a corresponding helical motion, providing extensive contact time and thereby increased oxygen transfer rates, resulting in increased biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand reduction, and nutrient removal. Figure 4 illustrates a further alternative embodiment of the present invention, in which the attached growth media element 201 is provided with attached growth media members in the form of both filaments 205a and leaves 205b. Such an embodiment of the present invention allows the advantages of both the filamentary element 1 and the leaved element 101 within a single element 201, as well as providing increased attached growth diversity. Figure 6 illustrates a closely spaced array of attached growth media elements 1 arranged to providing a filter for the treatment of water. The individual helical arrangements (examples 7 and 9 indicated) can be seen to overlap to provide a dense filter. It will also be apparent that by varying the overlap or separation of neighbouring elements 1, such an array also provides options for variable density filtering. Where a dense filter is required, the array may be arranged so the individual elements overlap by, say 10% to 75%, providing a dense biological matrix of filaments (alternatively leaves and filaments). Where a less dense filter is required, the array may be arranged to provide a greater separation between neighbouring elements 1. Figure 7 shows a cross-sectional schematic side view of an attached growth media system 300 for the treatment of wastewater flow within a water treatment facility or within a body of water. Several elements 301 (which correspond to elements 1,201 or other element within the scope of the present invention) are disposed within the system, suspended within a vessel of water. Figure 7a shows a first configuration in which the elements 301 are spaced apart, while Figure 7b shows a second configuration in which the elements 301 are closely packed. An overflow tank 304 is provided to receive filtered water. In use the system may be installed in a new or existing water treatment facility or in a body of water, and may be provided with a lateral flow to effect bio-filtration of solids and particulate contaminants within the water body. In the configuration of Figure 7(b) the array of elements 301 provides a filter comparable to a vertically oriented horizontal flow biofilter with an overlapping filter matrix, achieving a attached growth version of a membrane bio-reactor, where the water to be cleaned is to be passed through overlapping attached growth media rather than a membrane. An array support structure is arranged so as to allow variation of the density of the elements (and hence attached growth media). Accordingly, during an active treatment cycle the array of elements 301 may be packed tightly together providing a small pore or dense bio-filtration stage (as per Figure 7(b)) and during a cleaning cycle the elements 301 may be separated (as shown in Figure 7(a)) allowing a flushing and cleaning process, allowing filtered material to slough of the ends of the media strands and settle to the bottom of the reactor where they may be digested, or removed. Aeration systems may be integrated with the media system 300, either through a aeration device in close proximity to the elements 301 or through an air supply line extending through individual core members (e.g. by a combination of conduits or throughbores and one or more outlets). Alternatively a compressed water flow draft tube and Venturi jet may be integrated with the core members, for the supply of air. In use, bubbles rise up through the media (illustrated figuratively by arrows 306) providing the various effects and advantages previously described. Aeration may form part of the flushing and cleaning process. Performance characteristics of the media elements of the present invention may be increased by inoculation - for example with a pre-treatment of the media members in a blend of bacterial, mycological and enzyme, nutrient and mineral constituents which may be adjusted for the water treatment characteristics of each application site. The filaments may be infused by spray application or submersion in an inoculation tank. Dried inoculants may be fused to the attached growth media by passing the filaments through a closed chamber filled with a turbulent heated cloud of dried inoculants, by which process the heated inoculants stick to the media and form a long lasting bond. Inoculants may alternatively be blended with the raw material of the attached growth media effectively embedding the inoculants within the filaments. The growth media may be composed of materials having a plurality of magnetic and/or ionic properties. This diversity of material properties establishes conditions attractive to different bacterial and biological groups. Alternating sections of anionic and cationic media members increases the biological diversity of attached growth organisms attaching themselves to the media and enhances the range of contaminants which may effectively be treated. Similarly, the growth media may also provide colour contrasts, which further contribute to the diversity of bacteria and biological organisms, further enhancing treatment efficacy. For example, alternating sections of dark and light coloured media may be provided. Embodiments of the present invention may include sections of dark brown or black filaments alternating with sections of white or light brown filaments. Use of contrasting colours within the media provides for a diversity of attached growth organisms. In another example, alternating red and green or purple and yellow arrangements of media establish preferable growth sections for different bacteria. Both colour contrast and ionic contrast are advantageously included in sections of media or alternatively along individual filaments. Particular embodiments alternate both contrasting colour as well as opposing ionic properties so as to attract the greatest diversity of attached growth treatment bacteria and achieve the greatest range of treatment capability. The invention provides an improved attached growth media element suitable for use in the treatment of contaminated water, wastewater, potable water, industrial water as well as polluted water bodies. The attached growth media element comprises a plurality of attached growth media members that are arranged helically on an elongate core member and extend radially therefrom. Benefits include reduced bunching of members, improved water throughput, increased effective contact area between attached growth and water to be treated, and reduced risk of fouling. In addition, the elements provide a diversity of biological growth environments by which a corresponding diversity of attached growth organisms can be accommodated. An attached growth media system comprising a plurality of such attached growth media elements provides varying filtering densities and may be added to an existing treatment works without the requirement for additional apparatus. Corresponding methods are also provided. The nature of the elements disclosed herein overcomes the many and varied challenges of providing hardy and efficient attached growth media and greatly expands the range of applications in which attached growth media can be effectively employed.
