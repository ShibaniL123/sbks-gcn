RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/695,719 filed on Aug. 31, 2012 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/743,501 filed on Sep. 6, 2012. SCOPE OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the present invention provides a transgenic non-human animal model [BF1]which is selected to overexpress Spy1A under the control of a MMTV promoter causing the animal model to develop cancer, and preferably breast cancer. In another aspect, the present invention provides a transgenic non-human animal model selected to express Spy1A in one or more tissues thereof when an antibiotic is fed to the animal, and leading to the development of cancer, most preferably breast cancer. In another aspect, the present invention provides a transgenic non-human animal model, preferably a mammal and most preferably a mouse model, which includes a MMTV-SV40-Spy1A gene sequence (hereinafter referred interchangeably as “MMTV-SV40-Spy1A”, “MMTV-SV40-Spy1”, “MMTV-Spy1A” and “MMTV-Spy1”). The animal model of the invention may permit uses in the identification of agents for inhibiting or treating cancer, or namely breast cancer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Amid all cancers known to afflict the Canadian population, breast cancer (BC) is documented as the second leading cause of cancer deaths among females. Current knowledge of the molecular signatures and biochemical pathways that govern BC initiation and progression is far from comprehensive and requires further expansion in order to identify putative biomarkers that undoubtedly predict the correct therapeutic course of action to take with each patient. Due to the heterogeneous nature of cell types which cooperate to form a functional post-natal mammary gland, the various clinical forms of BC that may arise are currently distinguished based on prognostic criteria such as histological phenotype, steroid and growth factor receptor status, and tumor ability to metastasize to neighbouring lymph nodes. In order to fully understand the various molecular mechanisms underpinning the evolution of mammary tumorigenesis, post-pubertal mammary gland development is often looked upon to highlight critical signaling pathways that possess the inherent capacity to mutate and/or become deregulated in BC. Once maturity is established, the adult virgin mammary organ retains the ability to cycle through four development stages: virgin, pregnancy, lactation, followed by involution and reversion to a virgin-like state. During early pregnancy-induced lobuloalveolar development, elevated expression of prolactin, placental lactogens, and progesterone results in escalated rates of luminal epithelial proliferation, and promotes functional differentiation of alveolar precursor cells into specialized structures proficient in milk release. Parturition-induced lactogenesis functions to nourish neonates through alveolar milk production and secretion of colostrums into enlarged luminal ducts. Neonate weaning initiates extensive luminal alveolar cell death (apoptosis) and epithelial remodelling during involution, a process lasting for several days to allow for reinstatement of the mammary gland to a virgin-like appearance. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been appreciated that at a cellular level Speedy (Spy1A) plays a role in the DNA damage response, functioning to enhance cell survival and promote cell proliferation in lieu of apoptosis. Spy1A is capable of promoting precocious development and tumorigenesis. Hence, determining how Spy1A protein levels are regulated may reveal novel information regarding the dynamics of cell cycle control during normal and abnormal growth conditions. Furthermore, non-degradable forms of Spy1A do not trigger intrinsic cell cycle checkpoints but, rather, promote cell proliferation and oncogenic cell transformation demonstration that this mechanism may contribute to tumorigenesis. Further, it has been appreciated that Spy1A is a novel cell cycle gene whose product binds to cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) and activates its kinase activity to promote cell cycle progression through a cyclin independent mechanism and to promote cell movement into DNA synthesis. Spy1A is expressed naturally at high levels in the proliferating mammary gland, and aberrant overexpression of Spy1A results in precocious mammary development and eventually tumorigenesis in vivo. Spy1A elevation in c-Myc overexpressing tumors can be maintained during primary tumor culture, the MMTV-Myc mouse model, well documented for its ability to form aggressive mammary adenocarcinomas, may be utilized to derive a previously uncharacterized tumor cell line engineered to overexpress c-Myc (henceforth referred to as F5A1-2). Induction of the mammary oncogene c-Myc upregulates Spy1A and it is further demonstrated that Spy1A protein levels are elevated in mammary tissue and breast tumors derived from MMTV-Myc transgenic mice. Spy1A knockdown in F5A1-2 cell lines led to downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinas inhibitors (CKI) p21 and p27, a 23% reduction in proliferation rate, and a shift in cellular phenotype to a spindle-like/fibroblastic morphology. Together, findings support that Spy1 A plays a functional role in mammary-related c-Myc signal transduction, and acts downstream of ERα, c-Myc, and the MAPK cascade to regulate proliferation, mammary development, and carcinogenesis. One possible non-limiting object of the present invention is to provide a powerful tool for the study of cancer, namely breast cancer. Specifically, in one aspect the invention provides a transgenic non-human animal model whose somatic cells contain at least one copy of a MMTV-Spy1 transgene causing Spy1A overexpression under the control of the MMTV promoter, and causing this animal model to develop cancer, or more particularly breast cancer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The gene fragment construct MMTV-SV40-Spy1A (SEQ ID NO: 5) for the development of a transgenic mouse according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1. The construct was micro injected at roughly 4.7 kb into 357 fertilized embryos from superovulated female mice and transplanted into pseudo pregnant CD-1 female mice.

SDM reactions were performed with the following components: Flag-Spy1A-pLXSN vector DNA (10-100 ng); 0.3 mM dNTP mix (Cat. No. DD0057, Biobasic Inc., Ontario, Canada); 1× pfx buffer and 1 μl pfx polymerase (Cat. No. 11708-013, Invitrogen, Canada); 1 mM MgSO4; 1 μM each of A424 forward and A425 reverse primers (SEQ ID NOs: 6 and 7); filter-sterilize nuclease free water up to 50.0 Cycling conditions for SDM include (1) 2 minutes at 94° C., (2) 25 cycles of 94° C. for 15 seconds, 55° C. for 30 seconds and 68° C. for 5 seconds, and (3) 68° C. for 10 minutes. SDM reaction products were DpnI digested for 2 hours at 37° C. (Cat. No. ER1701, Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), and subsequently transformed utilizing TOP10 E.coli and plated onto 100 mg/ml Ampicillin plates. Select colonies were screened for EcoRI insertion and were identified upon detection of a 977 by fragment following EcoRI digestion (for 20 minutes at 37° C. (Cat. No. FD0274, Fermentas)) of isolated plasmid DNA from each colony (using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Cat. No. 27104, Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) as shown in FIG. 4. Successful EcoRI insertion was confirmed through sequencing for two colonies in particular, Is.1 and IIs.3, utilizing A210 and A211 sequencing primers (SEQ ID NOs: 8 and 9). Purified vector DNA from Colony IIs.3 was subjected to EcoRI digestion (Cat. No. ER0271, Fermentas), and produced two fragments at 7.0 kb (vector backbone) and 1.0 kb (Spy1A gene insert). Digestion products were separated, and the appropriate 1.0 kb fragment was gel extracted using the EZ-10 Spin Column DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Cat. No. BS354, Biobasic Inc.) and purified. EcoRI digestion of 2 mg of MMTV-SV40-TRPS-1 vector DNA ensued for 1 hour at 37°, followed by the immediate removal of terminal phosphate groups from digested ends utilizing incubation with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Cat. No. EF0341, Fermentas) for 30 minutes at 37°. Phosphatase treatment was necessary in order to prevent the re-ligation of linearized vector DNA termini. Consequently, reaction products were separated, followed by gel purification of the resultant 6.0 kb fragment (MMTV-SV40 backbone) using the EZ-10 Spin Column DNA Gel Extraction Kit. Ligation of the Spy1A gene insert into the MMTV-SV40 backbone was conducted using T4 DNA ligase (Cat. No. EL0017, Fermentas), and ligation reactions were subsequently transformed utilizing TOP10 E. coli and plated onto 100 mg/ml Ampicillin plates. Select colonies were screened for EcoRI insertion and were identified upon detection of a 977 by fragment following EcoRI digestion of isolated plasmid DNA from each colony as shown in FIG. 5. Successful cloning of the Spy1A coding sequence into the MMTV-SV40 vector backbone was confirmed through sequencing. Sequencing primers A252, A253, A254, A255, A256, A257, A258 and A259 (SEQ ID NOs: 10 to 16) were utilized in order to verify the intactness of all transgenic vector components. The resultant transgenic vector was designated as MMTV-SV40-Spy1A and contains an untranslated portion of the Ha-ras gene, in addition to an SV40 polyadenylation site. Bacterial sequences such as those found in vector backbones have been noted to inhibit successful incorporation of transgenic DNA into the mouse blastocyst genome. Thus, XhoI/SpeI double digestion (Cat. Nos. ER0691 and ER1251, Fermentas) of purified vector DNA (30 mg per tube) ensued, and resulted in the production of two fragments: 4.7 kb (MMTV-SV40-Spy1A transgene) and 2.9 kb (remaining backbone) as shown in FIG. 6. Two vials of XhoI/SpeI digested transgenic DNA were made available for microinjection into mouse blastocysts for subsequent creation of the first MMTV-SV40-Spy1A transgenic mouse model known to date. Transgene detection of a single copy of MMTV-SV40-Spy1A DNA was tested utilizing the PCR conditions outlined for MO22 and MO23 genotyping primers (SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4) as shown in FIG. 7. The resulting transgene fragment was sent to the University of Western Ontario Transgenic Facility to undergo pronuclear injections. Tail samples from the resulting litters were received and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen Puregene Core Kit A for mouse tails. Transgene detection was accomplished using two sets of primers with two unique forward primers (MO22 (SEQ ID NO: 2) and A933 (SEQ ID NO: 3)) and one reverse primer (M023 (SEQ ID NO: 4)). PCR cycling conditions consisted of (1) denaturation at 94° C. for 3 min, (2) denaturation at 94° C. for 1 min, annealing at 55° C. for 2 min, elongation at 72° C. for 1 min and (3) a final elongation step at 72° C. for 3 min. Each 25 uL PCR reaction was made using UBI HP Taq DNA polymerase (HPTAQ-01) and contained a final concentration of 2 ng/uL of pure genomic DNA, 1× buffer, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.5 mM forward primer, 0.5 mM reverse primer and 0.025U/uL Taq polymerase. Additionally, a final volume of 1% and 4% DMSO was added for primer pairs MO22 (SEQ ID NO: 2)/MO23 (SEQ ID NO: 4) and A933 (SEQ ID NO: 3)/MO23 (SEQ ID NO: 4) respectively. PCR amplification resulted in an 825 bp and 197 bp amplicon for primers MO22 (SEQ ID NO: 2)/MO23 (SEQ ID NO: 4) and A933 (SEQ ID NO: 3)/MO23 (SEQ ID NO: 4) respectively as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, respectively. Expression levels of Spy1A was tested in the inguinal mammary glands of 6 week old MMTV-Spy1A mice and their negative littermates via qRT PCR analysis to ensure Spy1A was being overexpressed in the mammary gland of this mouse model system. Spy1A was found to be significantly overexpressed in the mammary glands of MMTV-Spy1A mice as compared to their control littermates (FIG. 23). To test for increased susceptibility to mammary tumourigenesis, MMTV-Spy1A mice and their negative littermates were treated with 1 mg of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) once a week for 6 consecutive weeks beginning at 8 weeks of age via oral gavage. Treatment plan indicating age during treatment and at end of study is illustrated in FIG. 24. Mice were monitored on a weekly basis for the development of mammary tumours via palpitation. MMTV-Spy1A mice were found to develop significantly more mammary tumours than their control littermates (FIG. 25). Additionally, MMTV-Spy1A mice developed tumours earlier than their control littermates (FIG. 26). When collecting male MMTV-Spy1 mice over the age of 1 year, it was noted there was an increased incidence of liver carcinogenesis in the MMTV-Spy1 mice as compared to their negative control littermates (FIG. 27). Liver tissue was collected from MMTV-Spy1 male mice 1 year of age and older along with pair matched littermate controls and the liver tissue was subjected to qRT PCR analysis to determine Spy1 expression in the liver. Spy1 was found to be significantly overexpressed in MMTV-Spy1 male mice as compared to littermate controls (FIG. 28). In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fusion gene fragment construct Flag-Spy1A-pTRE-Tight (SEQ ID NO: 18) as illustrated in FIGS. 10, 14 and 15 were prepared. In particular, a Caspase3-pTRE-Tight vector was digested with EcoRI and PvuII to remove Caspase3. A 20 bp linker was then added to close the vector. Site directed mutagenesis was performed on a Flag-Spy1A-pLXSN vector to create an EcoRI restriction enzyme site to enable extraction of Flag-Spy1A from the vector. EcoRI digestion was subsequently performed to remove Flag-Spy1A from the Flag-Spy1A-pLXSN vector. The Flag-Spy1A fragment was then ligated into the pTRE-Tight vector. Successful preparation of DNA fusion gene fragment construct samples were confirmed by PCR amplification with the primer combination A548/A549 (SEQ ID NOs: 19 and 20) and polyacrylamide gel (as shown in FIGS. 16 to 22) as well as DNA sequencing. The bands of correct size are outlined under the lanes “1P” and/or “3P” in FIGS. 17 to 22. All tested PCR samples were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Spy1-pTRE plasmid were restriction digested using XhoI and A1wNI to isolate a portion for subsequent microinjection into a fertilized embryo from a superovulated female mouse. The digested portion was confirmed by gel electrophoresis as shown in FIG. 11. The digested portion was microinjected into fertilized embryos from superovulated female mice and transplanted into pseudo pregnant CD-1 female mice. Some resulting pups tested positive as confirmed and shown in FIG. 12. Successful germline transmission of the Spy1-pTRE transgene was confirmed as shown in FIG. 13. The mice having the Spy1-pTRE gene sequence was fed doxycycline to activate expression of Spy1A. Development of cancer including breast cancer was experimentally confirmed. In a separate study, selected Spy1A-pTRE mice found to lack inducible overexpression of Spy1A were nevertheless found to be suitable for preparing overexpressing progenies. In a controlled study, selected Spy1-pTRE mice found to be without inducible overexpression of Spy1A were preferably crossed with MMTV-rtTA mice to generated a MTB-Spy1 mouse model. It has been appreciated that such animal model may permit inducible overexpression of Spy1A preferably after administration of doxycycline to their diet in the form of food pellets. Indeed, expression of Spy1 was induced by administering 2 mg/mL of doxycycline at 5 weeks of age. Mammary glands were collected at 6 weeks of age from MTB-Spy1, Spy1-pTRE and MMTV-rtTA mice for qRT analysis to test for increased expression of Spy1 in the MTB-Spy1 mouse as compared to the selected controlSpy1-pTRE and MMTV-rtTA mice. Spy1 was found to be overexpressed in the MTB-Spy1 mouse, indicating this model system is functioning correctly (FIG. 29). The applicant has appreciated that the present invention provides various advantages and applications, and which include without restriction a transgenic non-human animal model whose somatic cells contain at least one copy of a MMTV-Spy1A transgene causing the animal model to develop cancer. In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a transgenic non-human animal model all of whose germ cells and somatic cells contain an exogenous MMTV-SV40-Spy1A gene sequence introduced into said mammal, or an ancestor of said mammal, at an embryonic stage wherein said gene sequence comprises a mouse mammary tumor virus gene (MMTV), a functionally disrupted SV40 gene (SV40) and a modified human Spy1A gene of SEQ ID NO: 1. Other applications of the invention include without restriction: Methods of screening drugs/vaccines/or other vehicles developed for the prevention of the development of cancer;The study environmental factors and their effects on the development of cancer;The study cancer initiated at various stages of the animals development;Methods of screening drugs candidates and their anti-carcinogenic;Methods of screening drugs/vaccines/or other vehicles developed for the prevention of the development of cancer;The study environmental factors and their effects on the development of cancer; andThe study of cancer namely breast cancer based on a novel expression of Spy1A initiated within a model animal by feeding the animal doxycycline. Additional applications of the invention include, without restriction: 1. Expression of Spy1 A within one or more tissues of the model animal is activated by the animal model ingesting doxycycline (Dox).2. The expression of Spy1A results in the tissues of the animal model results in the development of cancer namely breast cancer within that model animal.3. A transgenic non-human animal model in this case being a mouse incorporates the condition and promoter response of claims 1 and 2.4. The mouse animal model is able to pass this condition expressed in claims 1 and 2 along to subsequent generations when cross with a mouse not having this condition.5. The transgenic non-human animal of claim 1, can be said animal selected from the group consisting of mice, rats, monkeys, sheep, and rabbits.6. Analysis of animal model DNA is able to confirm that transgenic condition exists in said animal model.7. Transgenic animal model may be used to: a. Study cancerb. Study cancer initiated at various stages of the animals developmentc. Method of screening drugs candidates and there anti-carcinogenicd. Method of screening drugs/vaccines/or other vehicles developed for the prevention of the development of cancer.e. Study environmental factors and their effects on the development of cancer INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE Incorporated herein by reference are two replacement compact discs and a further duplicate compact disc in Computer Readable Form each identically containing a single file named “sequence_listing.txt” created on Dec. 9, 2013 and which is 21 KB in size. 1.
