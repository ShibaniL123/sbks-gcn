FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to methods for reducing or preventing anaphylaxis to ηοηallergenic antigen with compositions comprising immunosuppressants, and related compositions. The methods and compositions allow for reduction or prevention of anaphylaxis development as a result of non-allergenic antigens, such as non-allergenic therapeutic macromolecules. Thus, methods and compositions are provided that can be used to reduce or prevent anaphylaxis due to the administration of a non-allergenic antigen, such as a non-allergenic therapeutic macromolecule.

A. INTRODUCTION Anaphylaxis is generally associated with allergic responses to allergens. However, anaphylaxis can also occur in response to administration of a non-allergenic antigen, such as a non-allergenic therapeutic macromolecule. Surprisingly, it have been found that synthetic nanocarriers attached to immunosuppressants administered concomitantly with non-allergenic antigens can be successfully used to block the immune pathways responsible for anaphylaxis to a non-allergenic antigen. Thus, the methods and compositions provided herein are useful for treating subject in need of therapy with a non-allergenic therapeutic macromolecule, particularly where the subject is at risk of anaphylaxis as a result of such treatment. It has been found that delivering doses of immunosuppressants concomitantly with non-allergenic antigens can effectively reduce or prevent anaphylaxis related to the non-allergenic antigens. The doses of such immunosuppressants when concomitantly administered with a non-allergenic antigen were surprisingly found to reduce or prevent anaphylaxis even when non-allergenic antigen is subsequently administered without further administration of the immunosuppressants. Thus, the doses of immunosuppressants concomitantly administered with non-allergenic antigen provide long-term protection from anaphylaxis. As such immune responses can be beneficial in countering anaphylaxis during therapeutic treatment with non-allergenic therapeutic macromolecules, the invention can be useful for promoting tolerogenic immune responses in subjects in need of treatment with a non-allergenic therapeutic macromolecule. The inventors have unexpectedly and surprisingly discovered that the problems and limitations noted above can be overcome by practicing the invention disclosed herein. The present invention is illustrated in the Examples below. The invention will now be described in more detail below. Β. DEFINITIONS "Administering" or "administration" or “administer” means providing a material to a subject in a manner that is pharmacologically useful. The term is intended to include “causing to be administered” in some embodiments. “Causing to be administered” means causing, urging, encouraging, aiding, inducing or directing, directly or indirectly, another party to administer the material. “Amount effective” in the context of a composition or dosage form for administration to a subject refers to an amount of the composition or dosage form that produces one or more desired responses in the subject, for example, the generation of a tolerogenic immune response (e.g., a reduction in or prevention of anaphylaxis). This amount can refer to a single dose or multiple doses. Therefore, in some embodiments, an amount effective is the amount of any composition provided herein given as multiple doses that produces one or more of these desired immune responses and/or therapeutic effects as provided herein. The amount effective can be for in vitro or in vivo purposes. For in vivo purposes, the amount can be one that a clinician would believe may have a clinical benefit for a subject in need of reducing or preventing an anaphylactic reaction in a subject as a result of a non-allergenic antigen. Amounts effective can involve reducing the level of an undesired immune response, although in some embodiments, it involves preventing an undesired immune response altogether. Amounts effective can also involve delaying the occurrence of an undesired immune response. An amount that is effective can also be an amount of a composition provided herein that produces a desired therapeutic endpoint or a desired therapeutic result. Amounts effective, preferably, result in a tolerogenic immune response in a subject to an antigen, such as a non-allergenic antigen. The achievement of any of the foregoing can be monitored by routine methods. In some embodiments of any one of the compositions and methods provided, the amount effective is one in which the desired immune response persists in the subject for at least 1 week, at least 2 weeks or at least 1 month. In other embodiments of any of the compositions and methods provided, the amount effective is one which produces a measurable desired immune response, for example, a measurable decrease in an immune response (e.g., to a specific non-allergenic antigen), for at least 1 week, at least 2 weeks or at least 1 month. Amounts effective will depend, of course, on the particular subject being treated; the severity of a condition, disease or disorder; the individual patient parameters including age, physical condition, size and weight; the duration of the treatment; the nature of concurrent therapy (if any); the specific route of administration and like factors within the knowledge and expertise of the health practitioner. These factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine experimentation. It is generally preferred that a maximum dose be used, that is, the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, however, that a patient may insist upon a lower dose or tolerable dose for medical reasons, psychological reasons or for virtually any other reason. In general, doses of the immunosuppressants and/or non-allergenic antigens in the compositions of the invention can refer to the amount of the immunosuppressants and/or non-allergenic antigens. Alternatively, the dose can be administered based on the number of synthetic nanocarriers, such as synthetic nanocarriers that provide the desired amount of immunosuppressants. “Antigen-specific” refers to any immune response that results from the presence of the antigen, or portion thereof, or that generates molecules that specifically recognize or bind the antigen. When the antigen is a non-allergenic antigen, antigen-specific may mean ηοηallergenic antigen-specific. For example, where the immune response is antigen-specific antibody production, antibodies are produced that specifically bind the antigen. “Assessing an immune response” refers to any measurement or determination of the level, presence or absence, reduction, increase in, etc. of an immune response in vitro or in vivo. Such measurements or determinations may be performed on one or more samples obtained from a subject. Such assessing can be performed with any of the methods provided herein or otherwise known in the art. The assessing may be assessing the reduction, prevention, presence or absence of an anaphylactic reaction to a non-allergenic antigen. “Attach” or “Attached” or “Couple” or “Coupled” (and the like) means to chemically associate one entity (for example a moiety) with another. In some embodiments, the attaching is covalent, meaning that the attachment occurs in the context of the presence of a covalent bond between the two entities. In non-covalent embodiments, the non-covalent attaching is mediated by non-covalent interactions including but not limited to charge interactions, affinity interactions, metal coordination, physical adsorption, host-guest interactions, hydrophobic interactions, ΤΤ stacking interactions, hydrogen bonding interactions, van der Waals interactions, magnetic interactions, electrostatic interactions, dipole-dipole interactions, and/or combinations thereof. In embodiments, encapsulation is a form of attaching. In embodiments, non-allergenic antigens and immunosuppressants are not attached to one another, meaning that the antigens and immunosuppressants are not subjected to a process specifically intended to chemically associate one with another. In embodiments, non-allergenic antigens are not attached to synthetic nanocarriers, meaning that the antigens and synthetic nanocarriers are not subjected to a process specifically intended to chemically associate one with another. “Average”, as used herein, refers to the arithmetic mean unless otherwise noted. “Combination”, as applied to two or more materials and/or agents (also referred to herein as the components), is intended to define material in which the two or more materials/agents are associated. Components may be separately identified, e.g. first component, second component, third component, etc. The terms “combined” and “combining” in this context are to be interpreted accordingly. The association of the two or more materials /agents in a combination may be physical or non-physical. Examples of physically associated combined materials/agents include: • compositions (e.g. unitary formulations) comprising the two or more materials/agents in admixture (for example within the same unit dose); • compositions comprising material in which the two or more materials/agents are chemically/physicochemically linked (for example by crosslinking, molecular agglomeration or binding to a common vehicle moiety); • compositions comprising material in which the two or more materials/agents are chemically/physicochemically co-packaged (for example, disposed on or within lipid vesicles, particles (e.g. micro- or nanoparticles) or emulsion droplets); • pharmaceutical kits, pharmaceutical packs or patient packs in which the two or more materials/agents are co-packaged or co-presented (e.g. as part of an array of unit doses); Examples of non-physically associated combined materials/agents include: • material (e.g. a non-unitary formulation) comprising at least one of the two or more materials/agents together with instructions for the extemporaneous association of the at least one compound/agent to form a physical association of the two or more materials/agents; • material (e.g. a non-unitary formulation) comprising at least one of the two or more materials/agents together with instructions for combination therapy with the two or more materials/agents; • material comprising at least one of the two or more materials/agents together with instructions for administration to a patient population in which the other(s) of the two or more materials/agents have been (or are being) administered; • material comprising at least one of the two or more materials/agents in an amount or in a form which is specifically adapted for use in combination with the other(s) of the two or more materials/agents. As used herein, the term “combination therapy” is intended to define therapies which comprise the use of a combination of two or more materials/agents (as defined above). Thus, references to “combination therapy”, “combinations” and the use of materials/agents “in combination” in this application may refer to materials/agents that are administered as part of the same overall treatment regimen. As such, the posology of each of the two or more materials/agents may differ: each may be administered at the same time or at different times. It will therefore be appreciated that the materials/agents of the combination may be administered sequentially (e.g. before or after) or simultaneously, either in the same pharmaceutical formulation (i.e. together), or in different pharmaceutical formulations (i.e. separately). Simultaneously in the same formulation is as a unitary formulation whereas simultaneously in different pharmaceutical formulations is non-unitary. The posologies of each of the two or more materials/agents in a combination therapy may also differ with respect to the route of administration. “Concomitantly” means administering two or more materials/agents to a subject in a manner that is correlated in time, preferably sufficiently correlated in time so as to provide a modulation in a physiologic or immunologic response, and even more preferably the two or more materials/agents are administered in combination. In embodiments, concomitant administration may encompass administration of two or more materials/agents within a specified period of time, preferably within 1 month, more preferably within 1 week, still more preferably within 1 day, and even more preferably within 1 hour. In embodiments, the materials/agents may be repeatedly administered concomitantly; that is concomitant administration on more than one occasion, as may be provided in the Examples. “Determining” or “determine” means to ascertain a factual relationship. Determining may be accomplished in a number of ways, including but not limited to performing experiments, or making projections. For instance, a dose of an immunosuppressant or antigen may be determined by starting with a test dose and using known scaling techniques (such as allometric or isometric scaling) to determine the dose for administration. Such may also be used to determine a protocol as provided herein. In another embodiment, the dose may be determined by testing various doses in a subject, i.e. through direct experimentation based on experience and guiding data. In embodiments, “determining” or “determine” comprises “causing to be determined.” “Causing to be determined” means causing, urging, encouraging, aiding, inducing or directing or acting in coordination with an entity for the entity to ascertain a factual relationship; including directly or indirectly, or expressly or impliedly. “Dosage form" means a pharmacologically and/or immunologically active material in a medium, carrier, vehicle, or device suitable for administration to a subject. Any one of the compositions or doses provided herein may be in a dosage form. “Dose” refers to a specific quantity of a pharmacologically and/or immunologically active material for administration to a subject for a given time. “Encapsulate” means to enclose at least a portion of a substance within a synthetic nanocarrier. In some embodiments, a substance is enclosed completely within a synthetic nanocarrier. In other embodiments, most or all of a substance that is encapsulated is not exposed to the local environment external to the synthetic nanocarrier. In other embodiments, ηο more than 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% or 5% (weight/weight) is exposed to the local environment. Encapsulation is distinct from absorption, which places most or all of a substance on a surface of a synthetic nanocarrier, and leaves the substance exposed to the local environment external to the synthetic nanocarrier. “Generating” means causing an action, such as a physiologic or immunologic response (e.g., a tolerogenic immune response) to occur, either directly oneself or indirectly. “Identifying a subject” is any action or set of actions that allows a clinician to recognize a subject as one who may benefit from the methods, compositions or kits provided herein. Preferably, the identified subject is one who is in need of therapeutic benefit from a ηοηallergenic antigen as provided herein. The action or set of actions may be either directly oneself or indirectly. In one embodiment of any one of the methods provided herein, the method further comprises identifying a subject in need of a method, composition or kit as provided herein. “Immunosuppressant” means a compound that causes an APC to have an immunosuppressive effect (e.g., tolerogenic effect) or a Τ cell or a Β cell to be suppressed. An immunosuppressive effect generally refers to the production or expression of cytokines or other factors by the APC that reduces, inhibits or prevents an undesired immune response or that promotes a desired immune response, such as a regulatory immune response. When the APC acquires an immunosuppressive function (under the immunosuppressive effect) on immune cells that recognize an antigen presented by this APC, the immunosuppressive effect is said to be specific to the presented antigen. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is thought that the immunosuppressive effect is a result of the immunosuppressant being delivered to the APC, preferably in the presence of an antigen. In one embodiment, the immunosuppressant is one that causes an APC to promote a regulatory phenotype in one or more immune effector cells. For example, the regulatory phenotype may be characterized by the inhibition of the production, induction, stimulation or recruitment of antigen-specific CD4+ Τ cells or Β cells, the inhibition of the production of antigen-specific antibodies, the production, induction, stimulation or recruitment of Treg cells (e.g., CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ Treg cells), etc. This may be the result of the conversion of CD4+ Τ cells or Β cells to a regulatory phenotype. This may also be the result of induction of FoxP3 in other immune cells, such as CD8+ Τ cells, macrophages and iNKT cells. In one embodiment, the immunosuppressant is one that affects the response of the APC after it processes an antigen. In another embodiment, the immunosuppressant is not one that interferes with the processing of the antigen. In a further embodiment, the immunosuppressant is not an apoptotic-signaling molecule. In another embodiment, the immunosuppressant is not a phospholipid. Immunosuppressants include, but are not limited to, statins; mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin or a rapamycin analog; TGF-P signaling agents; TGF-P receptor agonists; histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as Trichostatin A; corticosteroids; inhibitors of mitochondrial function, such as rotenone; Ρ38 inhibitors; ΝΡ-κβ inhibitors, such as 6Bio, Dexamethasone, TCPA-1, IKK VII; adenosine receptor agonists; prostaglandin Ε2 agonists (PGE2), such as Misoprostol; phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor (PDE4), such as Rolipram; proteasome inhibitors; kinase inhibitors; G-protein coupled receptor agonists; G-protein coupled receptor antagonists; glucocorticoids; retinoids; cytokine inhibitors; cytokine receptor inhibitors; cytokine receptor activators; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor antagonists; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists; histone deacetylase inhibitors; calcineurin inhibitors; phosphatase inhibitors; PI3KB inhibitors, such as TGX-221; autophagy inhibitors, such as 3-Methyladenine; aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibitors; proteasome inhibitor I (PSI); and oxidized ATPs, such as Ρ2Χ receptor blockers. Immunosuppressants also include IDO, vitamin D3, cyclosporins, such as cyclosporine A, aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibitors, resveratrol, azathiopurine (Aza), 6-mercaptopurine (6-ΜΡ), 6-thioguanine (6-TG), FK506, sanglifehrin A, salmeterol, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), aspirin and other COX inhibitors, niflumic acid, estriol, methotrexate and triptolide. In embodiments, the immunosuppressant may comprise any of the agents provided herein. The immunosuppressant can be a compound that directly provides the immunosuppressive effect on APCs or it can be a compound that provides the immunosuppressive effect indirectly (i.e., after being processed in some way after administration). Immunosuppressants, therefore, include prodrug forms of any of the compounds provided herein. In embodiments of any one of the methods, compositions or kits provided herein, the immunosuppressants provided herein are attached to synthetic nanocarriers. In preferable embodiments, the immunosuppressant is an element that is in addition to the material that makes up the structure of the synthetic nanocarrier. For example, in one embodiment, where the synthetic nanocarrier is made up of one or more polymers, the immunosuppressant is a compound that is in addition and attached to the one or more polymers. As another example, in one embodiment, where the synthetic nanocarrier is made up of one or more lipids, the immunosuppressant is again in addition and attached to the one or more lipids. In embodiments, such as where the material of the synthetic nanocarrier also results in an immunosuppressive effect, the immunosuppressant is an element present in addition to the material of the synthetic nanocarrier that results in an immunosuppressive effect. Other exemplary immunosuppressants include, but are not limited, small molecule drugs, natural products, antibodies (e.g., antibodies against CD20, CD3, CD4), biologics-based drugs, carbohydrate-based drugs, nanoparticles, liposomes, RNAi, antisense nucleic acids, aptamers, methotrexate, NSAIDs; fingolimod; natalizumab; alemtuzumab; anti-CD3; tacrolimus (FK506); cytokines and growth factors, such as TGF-P and IL-10; etc. Further immunosuppressants, are known to those of skill in the art, and the invention is not limited in this respect. In embodiments of any one of the methods, compositions or kits provided herein, the immunosuppressant is in a form, such as a nanocrystalline form, whereby the form of the immunosuppressant itself is a particle or particle-like. In embodiments, such forms mimic a virus or other foreign pathogen. Many drugs have been nanonized and appropriate methods for producing such drug forms would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Drug nanocrystals, such as nanocrystalline rapamycin are known to those of ordinary skill in the art (Katteboinaa, et al. 2009, International Journal of PharmTech Resesarch; Vol. 1, No. 3; ρρ682-694. As used herein a “drug nanocrystal” refers to a form of a drug (e.g., an immunosuppressant) that does not include a carrier or matrix material. In some embodiments, drug nanocrystals comprise 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% or more drug. Methods for producing drug nanocrystals include, without limitation, milling, high pressure homogenization, precipitation, spray drying, rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS), Nanoedge® technology (Baxter Healthcare), and Nanocrystal Technology™ (Elan Corporation). In some embodiments, a surfactant or a stabilizer may be used for steric or electrostatic stability of the drug nanocrystal. In some embodiments the nanocrystal or nanocrytalline form of an immunosuppressant may be used to increase the solubility, stability, and/or bioavailability of the immunosuppressant, particularly immunosuppressants that are insoluble or labile. In some embodiments, an anaphylactic reaction to a non-allergenic antigen is reduced or prevented to a comparable extent following administering a non-allergic antigen concomitantly with an immunosuppressant in nanocrystalline form as achieved following administration of a ηοηallergenic antigen concomitantly with a composition comprising synthetic nanocarriers attached to an immunosuppressant. “Load” of the immunosuppressant, when attached to a synthetic nanocarrier, is the amount of the immunosuppressant attached to a synthetic nanocarrier based on the total dry recipe weight of materials in an entire synthetic nanocarrier (weight/weight). Generally, such a load is calculated as an average across a population of synthetic nanocarriers. In one embodiment, the load of the immunosuppressant on average across a population of synthetic nanocarriers is between 0.0001% and 99%. In another embodiment, the load of the immunosuppressant is between 0.01% and 50%. In another embodiment, the load of the immunosuppressant is between 0.01% and 20%. In a further embodiment, the load of the immunosuppressant is between 0.1% and 10%. In still a further embodiment, the load of the immunosuppressant is between 1% and 10%. In still a further embodiment, the load is between 7% and 20%. In yet another embodiment, the load of the immunosuppressant is at least 0.1%, at least 0.2%, at least 0.3%, at least 0.4%, at least 0.5%, at least 0.6%, at least 0.7%, at least 0.8%, at least 0.9%, at least 1%, at least 2%, at least 3%, at least 4%, at least 5%, at least 6%, at least at least 7%, at least 8%, at least 9%, at least 10%, at least 11%, at least 12%, at least 13%, at least 14%, at least 15%, at least 16%, at least 17%, at least 18%, at least 19% at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99% on average across the population of synthetic nanocarriers.

In some embodiments of the above embodiments, the load of the immunosuppressant is no more than 25% on average across a population of synthetic nanocarriers. In embodiments, the load is calculated as may be described in the Examples or as otherwise known in the art. In some embodiments, when the form of the immunosuppressant is itself a particle or particle-like, such as a nanocrystalline immunosuppressant, the load of immunosuppressant is the amount of the immunosuppressant in the particles or the like (weight/weight). In such embodiments, the load can approach 97%, 98%, 99% or more.. “Maximum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier” means the largest dimension of a nanocarrier measured along any axis of the synthetic nanocarrier. “Minimum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier” means the smallest dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier measured along any axis of the synthetic nanocarrier. For example, for a spheroidal synthetic nanocarrier, the maximum and minimum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier would be substantially identical, and would be the size of its diameter. Similarly, for a cuboidal synthetic nanocarrier, the minimum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier would be the smallest of its height, width or length, while the maximum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier would be the largest of its height, width or length. In an embodiment, a minimum dimension of at least 75%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample, based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample, is equal to or greater than 100 nm. In an embodiment, a maximum dimension of at least 75%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample, based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample, is equal to or less than 5 μΐη. Preferably, a minimum dimension of at least 75%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample, based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample, is greater than 110 nm, more preferably greater than 120 nm, more preferably greater than 130 nm, and more preferably still greater than 150 nm. Aspects ratios of the maximum and minimum dimensions of synthetic nanocarriers may vary depending on the embodiment. For instance, aspect ratios of the maximum to minimum dimensions of the synthetic nanocarriers may vary from 1:1 to 1,000,000:1, preferably from 1:1 to 100,000:1, more preferably from 1:1 to 10,000:1, more preferably from 1:1 to 1000:1, still more preferably from 1:1 to 100:1, and yet more preferably from 1:1 to 10:1. Preferably, a maximum dimension of at least 75%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample, based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is equal to or less than 3 μΐη, more preferably equal to or less than 2 μΐη, more preferably equal to or less than 1 μΐη, more preferably equal to or less than 800 nm, more preferably equal to or less than 600 nm, and more preferably still equal to or less than 500 nm. In preferred embodiments, a minimum dimension of at least 75%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample, based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample, is equal to or greater than 100 nm, more preferably equal to or greater than 120 nm, more preferably equal to or greater than 130 nm, more preferably equal to or greater than 140 nm, and more preferably still equal to or greater than 150 nm. Measurement of synthetic nanocarrier dimensions (e.g., effective diameter) may be obtained, in some embodiments, by suspending the synthetic nanocarriers in a liquid (usually aqueous) media and using dynamic light scattering (DLS) (e.g. using a Brookhaven ZetaPALS instrument). For example, a suspension of synthetic nanocarriers can be diluted from an aqueous buffer into purified water to achieve a final synthetic nanocarrier suspension concentration of approximately 0.01 to 0.1 mg/mL. The diluted suspension may be prepared directly inside, or transferred to, a suitable cuvette for DLS analysis. The cuvette may then be placed in the DLS, allowed to equilibrate to the controlled temperature, and then scanned for sufficient time to acquire a stable and reproducible distribution based on appropriate inputs for viscosity of the medium and refractive indicies of the sample. The effective diameter, or mean of the distribution, is then reported. Determining the effective sizes of high aspect ratio, or non-spheroidal, synthetic nanocarriers may require augmentative techniques, such as electron microscopy, to obtain more accurate measurements. “Dimension” or “size” or “diameter” of synthetic nanocarriers means the mean of a particle size distribution, for example, obtained using dynamic light scattering. A “non-allergenic antigen” means an antigen that induces non-allergic immune responses and/or would not be considered likely to result in an allergic response. Νοηallergenic antigens can result in an anaphylatic or anaphylactoid response and such a response is characterized, in some embodiments, by production of primarily non-IgE antigen-specific antibodies, such as antigen-specific IgG antibodies. Such anaphylatic or anaphylactoid responses may result in the production of antigen-specific IgE antibodies but the production of such antibodies is not the primary response and/or is less than the production of non-IgE antibodies. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a non-allergenic antigen is one that can cause an anaphylactic response or anaphylactoid response generally characterized by one or more (or all) of the following: the presence of or increased concentration of antigen-specific IgG antibodies (such as IgGl antibodies); the absence of or reduced concentration of antigen-specific IgE antibodies; presence of IgG immune complexes; decreased expression of FcyRIII, for example on neutrophils and/or basophils; increased concentration of platelet activating factor (PAF), for example, by macrophages and/or basophils, and the like. In some embodiments, such anaphylactic responses can be monitored by assessing the quantity and/or specificity of antibodies; expression of FcyRIII; detection of IgG immune complexes, vasoactive mediators; cutaneous inflammation or irritation (e.g., a rash, hives, etc.), inflammation or swolling of mucosal tissues, respiratory compromise, organ dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms, measuring vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, cardiac output, or temperature. In some embodiments, a non-allergenic antigen comprises a non-allergenic therapeutic macromolecule or fragment or derivative thereof. “Non-methoxy-terminated polymer” means a polymer that has at least one terminus that ends with a moiety other than methoxy. In some embodiments, the polymer has at least two termini that ends with a moiety other than methoxy. In other embodiments, the polymer has no termini that ends with methoxy. “Non-methoxy-terminated, pluronic polymer” means a polymer other than a linear pluronic polymer with methoxy at both termini. Polymeric nanoparticles as provided herein can comprise non-methoxy-terminated polymers or nonmethoxy-terminated, pluronic polymers. “Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” or “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” means a pharmacologically inactive material used together with a pharmacologically active material to formulate the compositions. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients comprise a variety of materials known in the art, including but not limited to saccharides (such as glucose, lactose, and the like), preservatives such as antimicrobial agents, reconstitution aids, colorants, saline (such as phosphate buffered saline), and buffers. “Protocol” means a pattern of administering to a subject and includes any dosing regimen of one or more substances to a subject. Protocols are made up of elements (or variables); thus a protocol comprises one or more elements. Such elements of the protocol can comprise dosing amounts, dosing frequency, routes of administration, dosing duration, dosing rates, interval between dosing, combinations of any of the foregoing, and the like. In some embodiments, such a protocol may be used to administer one or more compositions of the invention to one or more test subjects. Immune responses in these test subjects can then be assessed to determine whether or not the protocol was effective in generating a desired or desired level of an immune response or therapeutic effect. Any therapeutic and/or immunologic effect may be assessed. One or more of the elements of a protocol may have been previously demonstrated in test subjects, such as non-human subjects, and then translated into human protocols. For example, dosing amounts demonstrated in non-human subjects can be scaled as an element of a human protocol using established techniques such as alimetric scaling or other scaling methods. Whether or not a protocol had a desired effect can be determined using any of the methods provided herein or otherwise known in the art. For example, a sample may be obtained from a subject to which a composition provided herein has been administered according to a specific protocol in order to determine whether or not specific immune cells, cytokines, antibodies, etc. were reduced, generated, activated, etc. Useful methods for detecting the presence and/or number of immune cells include, but are not limited to, flow cytometric methods (e.g., FACS), ELISpot, proliferation responses, cytokine production, and immunohistochemistry methods. Antibodies and other binding agents for specific staining of immune cell markers, are commercially available. Such kits typically include staining reagents for antigens that allow for FACS-based detection, separation and/or quantitation of a desired cell population from a heterogeneous population of cells. In embodiments, a number of compositions as provided herein are administered to another subject using one or more or all or substantially all of the elements of which the protocol is comprised. “Providing” means an action or set of actions that an individual performs that supply a needed item or set of items or methods for practicing of the present invention. The action or set of actions may be taken either directly oneself or indirectly. “Providing a subject” is any action or set of actions that causes a clinician to come in contact with a subject and administer a composition provided herein thereto or to perform a method provided herein thereupon.

A “therapeutic macromolecule” refers to any protein, carbohydrate, lipid or nucleic acid that may be administered to a subject and have a therapeutic effect. In some embodiments, administration of the therapeutic macromolecule to a subject may result in an undesired immune response. As described herein, administration of a therapeutic macromolecule as provided herein, in some embodiments, can enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of the therapeutic macromolecule, such as by reducing undesired immune responses thereto. In some embodiments, the therapeutic macromolecule may be a therapeutic polynucleotide or therapeutic protein. As provided herein, the therapeutic macromolecule is a non-allergenic therapeutic macromolecule. “Therapeutic polynucleotide” means any polynucleotide or polynucleotide-based therapy that may be administered to a subject and have a therapeutic effect. Such therapies include gene silencing. Examples of such therapy are known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, naked RNA (including messenger RNA, modified messenger RNA, and forms of RNAi). Examples of other therapeutic polynucleotides are provided elsewhere herein.

As provided herein, the therapeutic protein is a non-allergenic therapeutic protein. “Undesired immune response” refers to any undesired immune response that results from exposure to an antigen, promotes or exacerbates a disease, disorder or condition provided herein (or a symptom thereof), or is symptomatic of a disease, disorder or condition provided herein. Such immune responses generally have a negative impact on a subject’s health or is symptomatic of a negative impact on a subject’s health. Undesired immune responses include anaphylaxis to a non-allergenic antigen. C.

Synthetic nanocarriers can be solid or hollow and can comprise one or more layers. In some embodiments, each layer has a unique composition and unique properties relative to the other layer(s). To give but one example, synthetic nanocarriers may have a core/shell structure, wherein the core is one layer (e.g. a polymeric core) and the shell is a second layer (e.g. a lipid bilayer or monolayer).

In some embodiments, synthetic nanocarriers can comprise one or more polymers. In some embodiments, the synthetic nanocarriers comprise one or more polymers that is a ηοηmethoxy-terminated, pluronic polymer. In some embodiments, at least 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% (weight/weight) of the polymers that make up the synthetic nanocarriers are non-methoxy-terminated, pluronic polymers. In some embodiments, all of the polymers that make up the synthetic nanocarriers are non-methoxy-terminated, pluronic polymers. In some embodiments, the synthetic nanocarriers comprise one or more polymers that is a non-methoxy-terminated polymer. In some embodiments, at least 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% (weight/weight) of the polymers that make up the synthetic nanocarriers are non-methoxy-terminated polymers. In some embodiments, all of the polymers that make up the synthetic nanocarriers are non-methoxy-terminated polymers. In some embodiments, the synthetic nanocarriers comprise one or more polymers that do not comprise pluronic polymer. In some embodiments, at least 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% (weight/weight) of the polymers that make up the synthetic nanocarriers do not comprise pluronic polymer. In some embodiments, all of the polymers that make up the synthetic nanocarriers do not comprise pluronic polymer. In some embodiments, such a polymer can be surrounded by a coating layer (e.g., liposome, lipid monolayer, micelle, etc.). In some embodiments, various elements of the synthetic nanocarriers can be attached to the polymer. The immunosuppressants can be attached to the synthetic nanocarriers by any of a number of methods. Generally, the attaching can be a result of bonding between the immunosuppressants and the synthetic nanocarriers. This bonding can result in the immunosuppressants being attached to the surface of the synthetic nanocarriers and/or contained (encapsulated) within the synthetic nanocarriers. In some embodiments, however, the immunosuppressants are encapsulated by the synthetic nanocarriers as a result of the structure of the synthetic nanocarriers rather than bonding to the synthetic nanocarriers. In preferable embodiments, the synthetic nanocarrier comprises a polymer as provided herein, and the immunosuppressants are attached to the polymer. When attaching occurs as a result of bonding between the immunosuppressants and synthetic nanocarriers, the attaching may occur via a coupling moiety. A coupling moiety can be any moiety through which an immunosuppressant is bonded to a synthetic nanocarrier. Such moieties include covalent bonds, such as an amide bond or ester bond, as well as separate molecules that bond (covalently or non-covalently) the immunosuppressant to the synthetic nanocarrier. Such molecules include linkers or polymers or a unit thereof. For example, the coupling moiety can comprise a charged polymer to which an immunosuppressant electrostatically binds. As another example, the coupling moiety can comprise a polymer or unit thereof to which it is covalently bonded. In preferred embodiments, the synthetic nanocarriers comprise a polymer as provided herein. These synthetic nanocarriers can be completely polymeric or they can be a mix of polymers and other materials. In some embodiments, the polymers of a synthetic nanocarrier associate to form a polymeric matrix. In some of these embodiments, a component, such as an immunosuppressant, can be covalently associated with one or more polymers of the polymeric matrix. In some embodiments, covalent association is mediated by a linker. In some embodiments, a component can be noncovalently associated with one or more polymers of the polymeric matrix. For example, in some embodiments, a component can be encapsulated within, surrounded by, and/or dispersed throughout a polymeric matrix. Alternatively or additionally, a component can be associated with one or more polymers of a polymeric matrix by hydrophobic interactions, charge interactions, van der Waals forces, etc. A wide variety of polymers and methods for forming polymeric matrices therefrom are known conventionally. Polymers may be natural or unnatural (synthetic) polymers. Polymers may be homopolymers or copolymers comprising two or more monomers. In terms of sequence, copolymers may be random, block, or comprise a combination of random and block sequences. Typically, polymers in accordance with the present invention are organic polymers. In some embodiments, the polymer comprises a polyester, polycarbonate, polyamide, or polyether, or unit thereof. In other embodiments, the polymer comprises poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), polypropylene glycol, poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), poly(lactic-coglycolic acid), or a polycaprolactone, or unit thereof. In some embodiments, it is preferred that the polymer is biodegradable. Therefore, in these embodiments, it is preferred that if the polymer comprises a polyether, such as poly(ethylene glycol) or polypropylene glycol or unit thereof, the polymer comprises a block-co-polymer of a polyether and a biodegradable polymer such that the polymer is biodegradable. In other embodiments, the polymer does not solely comprise a polyether or unit thereof, such as poly(ethylene glycol) or polypropylene glycol or unit thereof. Other examples of polymers suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to polyethylenes, polycarbonates (e.g. poly(l,3-dioxan-2one)), polyanhydrides (e.g. poly(sebacic anhydride)), polypropylfumerates, polyamides (e.g. polycaprolactam), polyacetals, polyethers, polyesters (e.g., polylactide, polyglycolide, polylactide-co-glycolide, polycaprolactone, polyhydroxyacid (e.g. poly(P-hydroxyalkanoate))), poly(orthoesters), polycyanoacrylates, polyvinyl alcohols, polyurethanes, polyphosphazenes, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, poly ureas, polystyrenes, and polyamines, polylysine, polylysine-PEG copolymers, and poly(ethyleneimine), poly(ethylene imine)-PEG copolymers.

In some embodiments, polymers can be hydrophilic. For example, polymers may comprise anionic groups (e.g., phosphate group, sulphate group, carboxylate group); cationic groups (e.g., quaternary amine group); or polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl group, thiol group, amine group). In some embodiments, a synthetic nanocarrier comprising a hydrophilic polymeric matrix generates a hydrophilic environment within the synthetic nanocarrier. In some embodiments, polymers can be hydrophobic. In some embodiments, a synthetic nanocarrier comprising a hydrophobic polymeric matrix generates a hydrophobic environment within the synthetic nanocarrier. Selection of the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the polymer may have an impact on the nature of materials that are incorporated (e.g. attached) within the synthetic nanocarrier. In some embodiments, polymers may be modified with one or more moieties and/or functional groups. A variety of moieties or functional groups can be used in accordance with the present invention. In some embodiments, polymers may be modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG), with a carbohydrate, and/or with acyclic polyacetals derived from polysaccharides (Papisov, 2001, ACS Symposium Series, 786:301). Certain embodiments may be made using the general teachings of US Patent No. 5543158 to Gref et al., or WO publication W02009/051837 by Von Andrian et al. In some embodiments, polymers may be modified with a lipid or fatty acid group.

In some embodiments, a polymer may be PLGA. PLGA is a biocompatible and biodegradable co-polymer of lactic acid and glycolic acid, and various forms of PLGA are characterized by the ratio of lactic acid:glycolic acid. Lactic acid can be L-lactic acid, D-lactic acid, or D,L-lactic acid. The degradation rate of PLGA can be adjusted by altering the lactic acid:glycolic acid ratio. In some embodiments, PLGA to be used in accordance with the present invention is characterized by a lactic acid:glycolic acid ratio of approximately 85:15, approximately 75:25, approximately 60:40, approximately 50:50, approximately 40:60, approximately 25:75, or approximately 15:85. In some embodiments, polymers may be one or more acrylic polymers. In certain embodiments, acrylic polymers include, for example, acrylic acid and methacrylic acid copolymers, methyl methacrylate copolymers, ethoxyethyl methacrylates, cyanoethyl methacrylate, aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid), methacrylic acid alkylamide copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(methacrylic acid anhydride), methyl methacrylate, polymethacrylate, poly(methyl methacrylate) copolymer, polyacrylamide, aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, glycidyl methacrylate copolymers, polycyanoacrylates, and combinations comprising one or more of the foregoing polymers. The acrylic polymer may comprise fully-polymerized copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic acid esters with a low content of quaternary ammonium groups. In some embodiments, polymers can be cationic polymers. In general, cationic polymers are able to condense and/or protect negatively charged strands of nucleic acids (Zauner et al., 1998, Adv. Drug Del. Rev., 30:97; and Kabanov et al., 1995, Bioconjugate Chem., 6:7), poly(ethylene imine) (PEI; Boussif et al., 1995, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 1995, 92:7297), and poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (Kukowska-Latallo et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 93:4897; Tang et al., 1996, Bioconjugate Chem., 7:703; and Haensler et al., 1993, Bioconjugate Chem., 4:372) are positively-charged at physiological pH, form ion pairs with nucleic acids. In embodiments, the synthetic nanocarriers may not comprise (or may exclude) cationic polymers. In some embodiments, polymers can be degradable polyesters bearing cationic side chains (Putnam et al., 1999, Macromolecules, 32:3658; Barrera et al., 1993, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 115:11010; Kwon et al., 1989, Macromolecules, 22:3250; Lim et al., 1999, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 121:5633; and Zhou et al., 1990, Macromolecules, 23:3399). Examples of these polyesters include poly(L-lactide-co-L-lysine) (Barrera et al., 1993, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 115:11010), poly(serine ester) (Zhou et al., 1990, Macromolecules, 23:3399), poly(4-hydroxy-L-proline ester) (Putnam et al., 1999, Macromolecules, 32:3658; and Lim et al., 1999, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 121:5633), and poly(4-hydroxy-L-proline ester) (Putnam et al., 1999, Macromolecules, 32:3658; and Lim et al., 1999, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 121:5633). The properties of these and other polymers and methods for preparing them are well known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Patents 6,123,727; 5,804,178; 5,770,417; 5,736,372; 5,716,404; 6,095,148; 5,837,752; 5,902,599; 5,696,175; 5,514,378; 5,512,600; 5,399,665; Soc., 123:9480; Lim et al., 2001, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 123:2460; Langer, 2000, Ace. Chem. Res., 33:94; Langer, 1999, J. Control. Release, 62:7; and Uhrich et al., 1999, Chem. Rev., 99:3181). More generally, a variety of methods for synthesizing certain suitable polymers are described in Concise Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Polymeric Amines and Ammonium Salts, Ed. by Goethals, Pergamon Press, 1980; Principles of Polymerization by Odian, John Wiley & Sons, Fourth Edition, 2004; Contemporary Polymer Chemistry by Allcock et al., Prentice-Hall, 1981; Deming et al., 1997, Nature, 390:386; and in U.S. Patents 6,506,577, 6,632,922, 6,686,446, and 6,818,732. In some embodiments, polymers can be linear or branched polymers. In some embodiments, polymers can be dendrimers. In some embodiments, polymers can be substantially cross-linked to one another. In some embodiments, polymers can be substantially free of cross-links. In some embodiments, polymers can be used in accordance with the present invention without undergoing a cross-linking step. It is further to be understood that the synthetic nanocarriers may comprise block copolymers, graft copolymers, blends, mixtures, and/or adducts of any of the foregoing and other polymers. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the polymers listed herein represent an exemplary, not comprehensive, list of polymers that can be of use in accordance with the present invention. In some embodiments, synthetic nanocarriers do not comprise a polymeric component. In some embodiments, synthetic nanocarriers may comprise metal particles, quantum dots, ceramic particles, etc. In some embodiments, a non-polymeric synthetic nanocarrier is an aggregate of non-polymeric components, such as an aggregate of metal atoms (e.g., gold atoms). Compositions according to the invention can comprise elements, such as immunosuppressants, in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as preservatives, buffers, saline, or phosphate buffered saline. The compositions may be made using conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing and compounding techniques to arrive at useful dosage forms. In an embodiment, compositions, such as those comprising synthetic nanocarriers are suspended in sterile saline solution for injection together with a preservative. In embodiments, when preparing synthetic nanocarriers as carriers, methods for attaching components to the synthetic nanocarriers may be useful. If the component is a small molecule it may be of advantage to attach the component to a polymer prior to the assembly of the synthetic nanocarriers. In embodiments, it may also be an advantage to prepare the synthetic nanocarriers with surface groups that are used to attach the component to the synthetic nanocarrier through the use of these surface groups rather than attaching the component to a polymer and then using this polymer conjugate in the construction of synthetic nanocarriers. In certain embodiments, the coupling can be with a covalent linker. In embodiments, immunosuppressants according to the invention can be covalently attached to the external surface via a 1,2,3-triazole linker formed by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of azido groups on the surface of the nanocarrier with immunosuppressant containing an alkyne group or by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of alkynes on the surface of the nanocarrier with immunosuppressants containing an azido group. Such cycloaddition reactions are preferably performed in the presence of a Cu(I) catalyst along with a suitable Cu(I)-ligand and a reducing agent to reduce Cu(II) compound to catalytic active Cu(I) compound. This Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) can also be referred as the click reaction. Additionally, the covalent coupling may comprise a covalent linker that comprises an amide linker, a disulfide linker, a thioether linker, a hydrazone linker, a hydrazide linker, an imine or oxime linker, an urea or thiourea linker, an amidine linker, an amine linker, and a sulfonamide linker. An amide linker is formed via an amide bond between an amine on one component such as an immunosuppressant with the carboxylic acid group of a second component such as the nanocarrier. The amide bond in the linker can be made using any of the conventional amide bond forming reactions with suitably protected amino acids and activated carboxylic acid such N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated ester. A disulfide linker is made via the formation of a disulfide (S-S) bond between two sulfur atoms of the form, for instance, of R1-S-S-R2. A disulfide bond can be formed by thiol exchange of a component containing thiol/mercaptan group(-SH) with another activated thiol group on a polymer or nanocarrier or a nanocarrier containing thiol/mercaptan groups with a component containing activated thiol group. A triazole linker, specifically a 1,2,3-triazole of the form R2 , wherein Rl and R2 may be any chemical entities, is made by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of an azide attached to a first component such as the nanocarrier with a terminal alkyne attached to a second component such as the immunosuppressant. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction is performed with or without a catalyst, preferably with Cu(I)-catalyst, which links the two components through a 1,2,3-triazole function. This chemistry is described in detail by Sharpless et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41(14), 2596, (2002) and Meldal, et al, Chem. Rev., 2008, 108(8), 2952-3015 and is often referred to as a “click” reaction or CuAAC. In embodiments, a polymer containing an azide or alkyne group, terminal to the polymer chain is prepared. This polymer is then used to prepare a synthetic nanocarrier in such a manner that a plurality of the alkyne or azide groups are positioned on the surface of that nanocarrier. Alternatively, the synthetic nanocarrier can be prepared by another route, and subsequently functionalized with alkyne or azide groups. The component is prepared with the presence of either an alkyne (if the polymer contains an azide) or an azide (if the polymer contains an alkyne) group. The component is then allowed to react with the nanocarrier via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction with or without a catalyst which covalently attaches the component to the particle through the 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole linker. A thioether linker is made by the formation of a sulfur-carbon (thioether) bond in the form, for instance, of R1-S-R2. Thioether can be made by either alkylation of a thiol/mercaptan (-SH) group on one component with an alkylating group such as halide or epoxide on a second component. Thioether linkers can also be formed by Michael addition of a thiol/mercaptan group on one component to an electron-deficient alkene group on a second component containing a maleimide group or vinyl sulfone group as the Michael acceptor. In another way, thioether linkers can be prepared by the radical thiol-ene reaction of a thiol/mercaptan group on one component with an alkene group on a second component. A hydrazone linker is made by the reaction of a hydrazide group on one component with an aldehyde/ketone group on the second component. A hydrazide linker is formed by the reaction of a hydrazine group on one component with a carboxylic acid group on the second component. Such reaction is generally performed using chemistry similar to the formation of amide bond where the carboxylic acid is activated with an activating reagent. An imine or oxime linker is formed by the reaction of an amine or N-alkoxyamine (or aminooxy) group on one component with an aldehyde or ketone group on the second component. An urea or thiourea linker is prepared by the reaction of an amine group on one component with an isocyanate or thioisocyanate group on the second component. Αη amidine linker is prepared by the reaction of an amine group on one component with an imidoester group on the second component. An amine linker is made by the alkylation reaction of an amine group on one component with an alkylating group such as halide, epoxide, or sulfonate ester group on the second component. Alternatively, an amine linker can also be made by reductive amination of an amine group on one component with an aldehyde or ketone group on the second component with a suitable reducing reagent such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. A sulfonamide linker is made by the reaction of an amine group on one component with a sulfonyl halide (such as sulfonyl chloride) group on the second component. A sulfone linker is made by Michael addition of a nucleophile to a vinyl sulfone. Either the vinyl sulfone or the nucleophile may be on the surface of the nanocarrier or attached to a component. The component can also be conjugated to the nanocarrier via non-covalent conjugation methods. For example, a negative charged immunosuppressant can be conjugated to a positive charged nanocarrier through electrostatic adsorption. A component containing a metal ligand can also be conjugated to a nanocarrier containing a metal complex via a metal-ligand complex. In embodiments, the component can be attached to a polymer, for example polylactic acid-block-polyethylene glycol, prior to the assembly of the synthetic nanocarrier or the synthetic nanocarrier can be formed with reactive or activatible groups on its surface. In the latter case, the component may be prepared with a group which is compatible with the attachment chemistry that is presented by the synthetic nanocarriers’ surface. In other embodiments, a peptide component can be attached to VLPs or liposomes using a suitable linker. A linker is a compound or reagent that is capable of coupling two molecules together. In an embodiment, the linker can be a homobifuntional or heterobifunctional reagent as described in Hermanson 2008. For example, an VFP or liposome synthetic nanocarrier containing a carboxylic group on the surface can be treated with a homobifunctional linker, adipic dihydrazide (ADH), in the presence of EDC to form the corresponding synthetic nanocarrier with the ADH linker. The resulting ADH linked synthetic nanocarrier is then conjugated with a peptide component containing an acid group via the other end of the ADH linker on nanocarrier to produce the corresponding VFP or liposome peptide conjugate. For detailed descriptions of available conjugation methods, see Hermanson G Τ “Bioconjugate Techniques”, 2nd Edition Published by Academic Press, Inc., 2008. In addition to covalent attachment the component can be attached by adsorption to a pre-formed synthetic nanocarrier or it can be attached by encapsulation during the formation of the synthetic nanocarrier. Any immunosuppressant as provided herein can be used in the methods or compositions provided and can be, in some embodiments, attached to synthetic nanocarriers.

Additional therapeutic macromolecules useful in accordance with aspects of this invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art, and the invention is not limited in this respect. In some embodiments, a substance as provided herein, such as a non-allergenic antigen or immunosuppressant, may be isolated. Isolated refers to the element being separated from its native environment and present in sufficient quantities to permit its identification or use. This means, for example, the element may be (i) selectively produced by expression cloning or (ii) purified as by chromatography or electrophoresis. Isolated elements may be, but need not be, substantially pure. Because an isolated element may be admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient in a pharmaceutical preparation, the element may comprise only a small percentage by weight of the preparation. The element is nonetheless isolated in that it has been separated from the substances with which it may be associated in living systems, i.e., isolated from other lipids or proteins. Any of the elements provided herein may be isolated and included in the compositions or used in the methods in isolated form. D. METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THE METHODS AND RELATED COMPOSITIONS Aspects of the invention relate to determining a protocol for the methods of concomitant administration as provided herein. A protocol can be determined by varying the frequency, dosage amount and other aspects of administration of the non-allergenic antigen and the composition of immunosuppressant and subsequently assessing an anaphylactic reaction based on such variation. A preferred protocol for practice of the invention reduces or prevents anaphylaxis to a non-allergenic antigen. Synthetic nanocarriers may be prepared using a wide variety of methods known in the art. For example, synthetic nanocarriers can be formed by methods such as nanoprecipitation, flow focusing using fluidic channels, spray drying, single and double emulsion solvent evaporation, solvent extraction, phase separation, milling, microemulsion procedures, microfabrication, nanofabrication, sacrificial layers, simple and complex coacervation, and other methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Alternatively or additionally, aqueous and organic solvent syntheses for monodisperse semiconductor, conductive, magnetic, organic, and other nanomaterials have been described (Pellegrino et al., 2005, Small, 1:48; Murray et al., 2000, Ann. Rev. Mat. Sci., 30:545; and Trindade et al., 2001, Chem. Mat., 13:3843). Additional methods have been described in the literature (see, e.g., Doubrow, Ed., “Microcapsules and Nanoparticles in Medicine and Pharmacy,” CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1992; Mathiowitz et al., 1987, J. Control. Release, 5:13; Mathiowitz et al., 1987, Reactive Polymers, 6:275; and Mathiowitz et al., 1988, J. Appl. Polymer Sci., 35:755; US Patents 5578325 and 6007845; Ρ. Paolicelli et al., “Surface-modified PLGA-based Nanoparticles that can Efficiently Associate and Deliver Virus-like Particles” Nanomedicine. 5(6):843-853 (2010)). Various materials may be encapsulated into synthetic nanocarriers as desirable using a variety of methods including but not limited to C. Astete et al., “Synthesis and characterization of PLGA nanoparticles” J. Biomater. Sci. Polymer Edn, Vol. 17, No. 3, ρρ. 247-289 (2006); Κ. Avgoustakis “Pegylated Poly(Lactide) and Poly(Lactide-Co-Glycolide) Nanoparticles: Preparation, Properties and Possible Applications in Drug Delivery” Current Drug Delivery 1:321-333 (2004); C. Reis et al., “Nanoencapsulation I. Methods for preparation of drugloaded polymeric nanoparticles” Nanomedicine 2:8- 21 (2006); Ρ. Paolicelli et al., “Surface-modified PLGA-based Nanoparticles that can Efficiently Associate and Deliver Virus-like Particles” Nanomedicine. 5(6):843-853 (2010). Other methods suitable for encapsulating materials into synthetic nanocarriers may be used, including without limitation methods disclosed in United States Patent 6,632,671 to Unger issued October 14, 2003. In certain embodiments, synthetic nanocarriers are prepared by a nanoprecipitation process or spray drying. Conditions used in preparing synthetic nanocarriers may be altered to yield particles of a desired size or property (e.g., hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, external morphology, “stickiness,” shape, etc.). The method of preparing the synthetic nanocarriers and the conditions (e.g., solvent, temperature, concentration, air flow rate, etc.) used may depend on the materials to be attached to the synthetic nanocarriers and/or the composition of the polymer matrix. If synthetic nanocarriers prepared by any of the above methods have a size range outside of the desired range, such synthetic nanocarriers can be sized, for example, using a sieve. Elements (i.e., components) of the synthetic nanocarriers may be attached to the overall synthetic nanocarrier, e.g., by one or more covalent bonds, or may be attached by means of one or more linkers. Additional methods of functionalizing synthetic nanocarriers may be adapted from Published US Patent Application 2006/0002852 to Saltzman et al., Published US Patent Application 2009/0028910 to DeSimone et al., or Published International Patent Application WO/2008/127532 Al to Murthy et al. Alternatively or additionally, synthetic nanocarriers can be attached to components directly or indirectly via non-covalent interactions. In non-covalent embodiments, the ηοηcovalent attaching is mediated by non-covalent interactions including but not limited to charge interactions, affinity interactions, metal coordination, physical adsorption, host-guest interactions, hydrophobic interactions, ΤΤ stacking interactions, hydrogen bonding interactions, van der Waals interactions, magnetic interactions, electrostatic interactions, dipole-dipole interactions, and/or combinations thereof. Such attachments may be arranged to be on an external surface or an internal surface of a synthetic nanocarrier. In embodiments, encapsulation and/or absorption is a form of attaching. In embodiments, the synthetic nanocarriers can be combined with an antigen by admixing in the same vehicle or delivery system. Compositions provided herein may comprise inorganic or organic buffers (e.g., sodium or potassium salts of phosphate, carbonate, acetate, or citrate) and pH adjustment agents (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sodium or potassium hydroxide, salts of citrate or acetate, amino acids and their salts) antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol), surfactants (e.g., polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, polyoxyethylene9-10 nonyl phenol, sodium desoxycholate), solution and/or cryo/lyo stabilizers (e.g., sucrose, lactose, mannitol, trehalose), osmotic adjustment agents (e.g., salts or sugars), antibacterial agents (e.g., benzoic acid, phenol, gentamicin), antifoaming agents (e.g., polydimethylsilozone), preservatives (e.g., thimerosal, 2-phenoxyethanol, EDTA), polymeric stabilizers and viscosity-adjustment agents (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone, poloxamer 488, carboxymethylcellulose) and co-solvents (e.g., glycerol, polyethylene glycol, ethanol). Compositions according to the invention may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The compositions may be made using conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing and compounding techniques to arrive at useful dosage forms. Techniques suitable for use in practicing the present invention may be found in Handbook of Industrial Mixing: Science and Practice, Edited by Edward L. Paul, Victor A. Atiemo-Obeng, and Suzanne Μ. Kresta, 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; and Pharmaceutics: The Science of Dosage Form Design, 2nd Ed. Edited by Μ. Ε. Auten, 2001, Churchill Livingstone. In an embodiment, compositions are in a sterile saline solution for injection together with a preservative. It is to be understood that the compositions of the invention can be made in any suitable manner, and the invention is in no way limited to compositions that can be produced using the methods described herein. Selection of an appropriate method of manufacture may require attention to the properties of the particular moieties being associated. In some embodiments, compositions are manufactured under sterile conditions or are terminally sterilized. This can ensure that resulting compositions are sterile and non-infectious, thus improving safety when compared to non-sterile compositions. This provides a valuable safety measure, especially when subjects receiving the compositions have immune defects, are suffering from infection, and/or are susceptible to infection. In some embodiments, the compositions may be lyophilized and stored in suspension or as lyophilized powder depending on the formulation strategy for extended periods without losing activity. Administration according to the present invention may be by a variety of routes, including but not limited to subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, transmucosal, transdermal, transcutaneous or intradermal routes. In a preferred embodiment, administration is via a subcutaneous route of administration. The compositions referred to herein may be manufactured and prepared for administration, preferably in some embodiments concomitant administration, using conventional methods. The compositions of the invention can be administered in effective amounts, such as the effective amounts described elsewhere herein. Doses of dosage forms may contain varying amounts of populations of varying amounts of immunosuppressants and/or non-allergenic antigens, according to the invention. The amount of immunosuppressants and/or non-allergenic antigens present in the inventive dosage forms can be varied according to the nature of the non-allergenic antigen, and/or immunosuppressants, the therapeutic benefit to be accomplished, whether or not the immunsuppressants are attached to synthetic nanocarriers and other such parameters. In embodiments, dose ranging studies can be conducted to establish optimal therapeutic amount of the amount of immunosuppressants and/or non-allergenic antigens to be present in dosage forms. In embodiments, the immunosuppressants and/or non-allergenic antigens (when administered concomitantly) are present in dosage forms in an amount effective to generate a tolerogenic immune response to the non-allergenic antigens upon administration to a subject. Preferably the immunosuppressive immune response is a reduction or prevention of anaphylaxis to the non-allergenic antigen. It may be possible to determine amounts of the immunosuppressants and/or non-allergenic antigens effective to generate a tolerogenic immune response using conventional dose ranging studies and techniques in subjects. Inventive dosage forms may be administered at a variety of frequencies. In a preferred embodiment, a number of administrations are utilized to ensure a pharmacologically relevant response. In some embodiments, administration of immunosuppressants with non-allergenic antigens is undertaken e.g., prior to subsequent further administration of the non-allergenic antigens. In exemplary embodiments, immunosuppressants are administered multiple times with concomitant administration of non-allergenic antigen prior to subsequent further administration of the non-allergenic antigen. In some embodiments, the immunosuppressants are administered multiple times with concomitant administration of non-allergenic antigen over a period of at least 7, 14 or 21 days prior to subsequent further administration of the non-allergenic antigen alone. Another aspect of the disclosure relates to kits. In some embodiments, the kit comprises an immunosuppressant, in some embodiments attached to synthetic nanocarriers, and a non-allergenic antigen. The immunosuppressant and non-allergenic antigen can be contained within separate containers or within the same container in the kit. In some embodiments, the container is a vial or an ampoule. In some embodiments, the non-allergenic antigen and/or immunosuppressant are contained within a solution separate from the container, such that the non-allergenic antigen and/or immunosuppressant may be added to the container at a subsequent time. In some embodiments, the non-allergenic antigen and/or immunosuppressant are in lyophilized form each in a separate container or in the same container, such that they may be reconstituted at a subsequent time. In some embodiments, the kit further comprises instructions for reconstitution, mixing, administration, etc. In some embodiments, the instructions include a description of the methods described herein. Instructions can be in any suitable form, e.g., as a printed insert or a label. In some embodiments, the kit further comprises one or more syringes. EXAMPLES Example 1: Evaluating Tolerogenic Immune Responses with Synthetic Nanocarriers Comprising Immunosuppressant In Vivo (Prophetic) Method for Synthetic Nanocarrier Containing Rapamycin A primary water-in-oil emulsion is prepared first. W1/01 is prepared by combining 0.13 Μ hydrochloric acid solution (0.2 mL), solution 2 (0.75 mL), solution 3 (0.25 mL), and solution 4 (0.2 mL) in a small pressure tube and sonicating at 50% amplitude for 40 seconds using a Branson Digital Sonifier 250. A secondary emulsion (W1/01/W2) is then prepared by combining solution 5 (3.0 mL) with the primary Wl/Ol emulsion, vortexing for 10 s, and sonicating at 30% amplitude for 60 seconds using the Branson Digital Sonifier 250. The W1/01/W2 emulsion is added to a beaker containing 70 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer solution (30 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours to allow the methylene chloride to evaporate and for the synthetic nanocarriers to form. A portion of the synthetic nanocarriers are washed by transferring the synthetic nanocarrier suspension to a centrifuge tube and centrifuging at 21,000xg and 4 °C for one hour, removing the supernatant, and re-suspending the pellet in phosphate buffered saline. The washing procedure is repeated, and the pellet is re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline for a final synthetic nanocarrier dispersion of about 10 mg/mL. The amount of rapamycin in the synthetic nanocarrier is determined by HPLC analysis. The total dry-synthetic nanocarrier mass per mL of suspension is determined by a gravimetric method. Method for Measuring Rapamycin Load Approximately 3 mg of synthetic nanocarriers are collected and centrifuged to separate supernatant from synthetic nanocarrier pellet. Acetonitrile is added to the pellet, and the sample is sonicated and centrifuged to remove any insoluble material. The supernatant and pellet are injected on RP-HPLC and absorbance is read at 278nm. The pg found in the pellet are used to calculate % entrapped (load), pg in supernatant and pellet are used to calculate total pg recovered. Measurement of IgG The level of IgG antibodies are measured. Blocker Casein in PBS (Thermo Fisher, Catalog #37528) is used as diluent. 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS is used as wash buffer, prepared by adding 10 ml of Tween-20 ((Sigma, Catalog #P9416-100mL) to 2 liters of a 10χ PBS stock (PBS: OmniPur® 10Χ PBS Liquid Concentrate, 4L, EMD Chemicals, Catalog #6505) and 18 Liters of deionized water. Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) at a stock concentration of 5 mg/ml is used as a coating material. A 1:1000 dilution to 5 pg/ml is used as a working concentration. Each well of the assay plates is coated with 100 pi diluted OVA per well, plates are sealed with sealing film (VWR catalog #60941-120), and incubated overnight at 4°C. Costar 9017 96-well Flat bottom plates are used as assay plates (Costar 9017). Low-binding polypropylene 96-well plate or tubes are used as set-up plates, in which samples are prepared before being transferred to the assay plate. The setup plates did not contain any antigen and, therefore, serum antibodies did not bind to the plate during the setup of the samples. Setup plates are used for sample preparation to minimize binding that might occur during preparation or pipetting of samples if an antigen-coated plate is used to prepare the samples. Before preparing samples in the setup plate, wells are covered with diluent to block any non-specific binding and the plate is sealed and incubated at 4°C overnight. Assay plates are washed three times with wash buffer, and wash buffer is completely aspirated out of the wells after the last wash. After washing, 300 μ1 diluent are added to each well of assay plate(s) to block non-specific binding and plates are incubated at least 2 hours at room temperature. Serum samples are prepared in the setup plate at appropriate starting dilutions. Starting dilutions are sometimes also prepared in 1.5 ml tubes using diluent and then transferred to the set-up plate. Appropriate starting dilutions are determined based on previous data, where available. Where no previous data is available, the lowest starting dilution is 1:40. Once diluted, 200 μ1 of the starting dilution of the serum sample is transferred from the tube to the appropriate well of the setup plate. Once all samples were prepared in the setup plate, the plate is sealed and stored at 4°C until blocking of the assay plates is complete. Assay plates are washed three times with wash buffer, and wash buffer is completely aspirated after the last wash. After washing, 100 pL of diluent is added to wells in of the assay plates. A pipet is used to transfer samples from the setup plate to the assay plate. Samples are mixed prior to transfer by pipetting 150 μ1 of diluted serum up and down 3 times. After mixing, 150μ1 of each sample is transferred from the setup plate and added to the respective assay plate. Once the starting dilutions of each sample are transferred from the setup plate to the assay plate, serial dilutions are pipetted on the assay plate as follows: 50 μ1 of each serum sample is removed using a pipet and mixed with the 100 μ1 of diluent previously added. This step is repeated down the entire plate. After pipetting the dilution of the final row, 50 μ1 of fluid is removed from the wells in the final row and discarded, resulting in a final volume of 100 μ1 in every well of the assay plate. Once sample dilutions are prepared in the assay plates, the plates are incubated at room temperature for at least 2 hours. After the incubation, plates are washed three times with wash buffer. Detection antibody (Goat anti-mouse anti-IgG, HRP conjugated) is diluted 1:1500 (0.33 pg/mL) in diluent and 100 μ1 of the diluted antibody is added to each well. Plates are incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then washed three times with wash buffer, with each washing step including a soak time of at least 30 seconds. After washing, detection substrate is added to the wells. Equal parts of substrate A and substrate Β (BD Biosciences ΤΜΒ Substrate Reagent Set, catalog #555214) are combined immediately before addition to the assay plates, and 100 μ1 of the mixed substrate solution are added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes in the dark. The reaction is stopped by adding 50 μ1 of stop solution (2Ν H2S04) to each well after the 10 minute period. The optical density (OD) of the wells is assessed immediately after adding the stop solution on a plate reader at 450 nm with subtraction at 570 nm. Data analysis is performed using Molecular Device’s software SoftMax Pro ν5.4. A four-parameter logistic curve-fit graph is prepared with the dilution on the x-axis (log scale) and the OD value on the y-axis (linear scale), and the half maximum value (EC50) for each sample is determined. The plate template at the top of the layout is adjusted to reflect the dilution of each sample (1 per column). Example 2: Polymeric Nanocarrier Containing Polymer-Rapamycin Conjugate (Prophetic) Preparation of PLGA-rapamycin conjugate: PLGA polymer with acid end group (7525 DLG1A, acid number 0.46 mmol/g, Lakeshore Biomaterials; 5 g, 2.3 mmol, 1.0 eq) is dissolved in 30 mL of dichloromethane (DCM). N,N-Dicyclohexylcarbodimide (1.2 eq, 2.8 mmol, 0.57 g) is added followed by rapamycin (1.0 eq, 2.3 mmol, 2.1 g) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (2.0 eq, 4.6 mmol, 0.56 g). The mixture is stirred at rt for 2 days. The mixture is then filtered to remove insoluble dicyclohexylurea. The filtrate is concentrated to ca. 10 mL in volume and added to 100 mL of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to precipitate out the PLGA-rapamycin conjugate. The IPA layer is removed and the polymer is then washed with 50 mL of IPA and 50 mL of methyl t-butyl ether (ΜΤΒΕ). The polymer is then dried under vacuum at 35 C for 2 days to give PLGA-rapamycin as a white solid (ca. 6.5 g). Nanocarrier containing PLGA-rapamycin is prepared according to the procedure described in Example 1 as follows: Solutions for nanocarrier formation are prepared as follows: Solution 1: PLGA-rapamycin @100 mg/mL in methylene chloride. The solution is prepared by dissolving PLGA-rapamycin in pure methylene chloride. Solution 2: PLA-PEG @ 100 mg/mL in methylene chloride. The solution is prepared by dissolving PLA-PEG in pure methylene chloride. Solution 3: Polyvinyl alcohol @ 50 mg/mL in 100 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer. A primary water-in-oil emulsion is prepared first. Wl/Ol is prepared by combining solution 1 (0.75 mL), and solution 2 (0.25 mL) in a small pressure tube and sonicating at 50% amplitude for 40 seconds using a Branson Digital Sonifier 250. A secondary emulsion (W1/01/W2) is then prepared by combining solution 3 (3.0 mL) with the primary Wl/Ol emulsion, vortexing for 10 s, and sonicating at 30% amplitude for 60 seconds using the Branson Digital Sonifier 250. The W1/01/W2 emulsion is added to a beaker containing 70 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer solution (30 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours to allow the methylene chloride to evaporate and for the nanocarriers to form. A portion of the nanocarriers is washed by transferring the nanocarrier suspension to a centrifuge tube and centrifuging at 75,600xg and 4 °C for 35 min, removing the supernatant, and re-suspending the pellet in phosphate buffered saline. The washing procedure is repeated, and the pellet is re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline for a final nanocarrier dispersion of about 10 mg/mL. Example 3: Preparation of Gold Nanocarriers (AuNCs) Containing Rapamycin (Prophetic) Preparation of HS-PEG-rapamycin: A solution of PEG acid disulfide (1.0 eq), rapamycin (2.0-2.5 eq), DCC (2.5 eq) and DMAP (3.0 eq) in dry DML is stirred at rt overnight. The insoluble dicyclohexylurea is removed by filtration and the filtrate is added to isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to precipitate out the PEG-disulfide-di-rapamycin ester and washed with IPA and dried. The polymer is then treated with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride in DML to reduce the PEG disulfide to thiol PEG rapamycin ester (HS-PEG-rapamycin). The resulting polymer is recovered by precipitation from IPA and dried as previously described and analyzed by Η NMR and GPC. Formation of Gold NCs (AuNCs): An aq. solution of 500 mL of 1 mM HAuC14 is heated to reflux for 10 min with vigorous stirring in a 1 L round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser. A solution of 50 mL of 40 mM of trisodium citrate is then rapidly added to the stirring solution. The resulting deep wine red solution is kept at reflux for 25-30 min and the heat is withdrawn and the solution is cooled to room temperature. The solution is then filtered through a 0.8 pm membrane filter to give the AuNCs solution. The AuNCs are characterized using visible spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The AuNCs are ca. 20 nm diameter capped by citrate with peak absorption at 520 nm. AuNCs conjugate with HS-PEG-rapamycin: A solution of 150 pi of HS-PEG-rapamycin (10 μΜ in 10 mM pH 9.0 carbonate buffer) is added to 1 mL of 20 nm diameter citrate-capped gold nanocarriers (1.16 ηΜ) to produce a molar ratio of thiol to gold of 2500:1. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under argon for 1 hour to allow complete exchange of thiol with citrate on the gold nanocarriers. The AuNCs with PEG-rapamycin on the surface is then purified by centrifuge at 12,000g for 30 minutes. The supernatant is decanted and the pellet containing AuNC-S-PEG-rapamycin is then pellet washed with lx PBS buffer. The purified Gold-PEG-rapamycin nanocarriers are then resuspend in suitable buffer for further analysis and bioassays.

The O/W emulsion was prepared by combining solution 1(1 mL), solution 2 (0.1 mL), and solution 3 (3 mL) in a small pressure tube and sonicating at 30% amplitude for 60 seconds using a Branson Digital Sonifier 250. The O/W emulsion was added to a beaker containing 70 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer solution (30 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours to allow the methylene chloride to evaporate and for the nanocarriers to form. A portion of the nanocarriers was washed by transferring the nanocarrier suspension to a centrifuge tube and centrifuging at 75,000xg and 4 °C for 35 min, removing the supernatant, and re-suspending the pellet in phosphate buffered saline. The washing procedure was repeated, and the pellet was re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline for a final nanocarrier dispersion of about 10 mg/mL. Nanocarrier size was determined by dynamic light scattering. The amount rapamycin in the nanocarrier was determined by HPLC analysis.

The animals presenting high antibody responses were eliminated from subsequent boosts. Only animals with low or undetectable titers were kept as well as the control. These consisted mainly of the animals having received multiple doses of synthetic nanocarriers at 100pg, 50pg and 30pg. After day 21, all mice received 5 further injections of just KLH i.v. As seen in Fig. 2, untreated mice experienced a significant boost in their antibody titers while synthetic nanocarrier-treated mice had little to no antibody increase between days 21 to 54 (black symbols). Injection of KLH i.v. induces an anaphylaxic shock that can be evaluated by observing the following symptons: 0 score represented normal behavior, 1 represented decreased spontaneous activity, 2 represented decreased activity with falling over and a loss the self-righting reflex, and 3 was assigned to mice that became moribund with cool, cyanotic extremities (Liu, Ε., et al. (2002). "Anti-peptide autoantibodies and fatal anaphylaxis in NOD mice in response to insulin self-peptides Β:9-23 and Β: 13-23." Journal of Clinical 110(7): 1021-1027.). Similar to the titers, anaphylaxis was observed only in control animals, while little to no anaphylaxis was observed in synthetic nanocarrier-treated animals. Thus, it shown that compositions provided herein when administered over a period of time concomitantly with a protein can reduce or prevent antibody responses and the resulting anaphylaxis as a result of administration of the protein in a subject. Example 6: Inhibition of Anaphylaxis in an OVA-Alum Model Materials Rapamycin was purchased from TSZ CHEM (185 Wilson Street, Framingham, ΜΑ 01702; Product Code R1017).

Method Solutions were prepared as follows: Solution 1: PLGA at 75 mg/mL, PLA-PEG-OMe at 25 mg/mL, and rapamycin at 12.5 mg/mL in methylene chloride. The solution was prepared by dissolving PLGA, PLA-PEG-OMe, and rapamycin in pure methylene chloride. Solution 2: Polyvinyl alcohol @ 50 mg/mL in 100 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer. An oil-in-water emulsion was used to prepare the nanocarriers. The O/W emulsion was prepared by combining Solution 1 (1.0 mL) and Solution 2 (3.0 mL) in a small pressure tube and sonicating at 30% amplitude for 60 seconds using a Branson Digital Sonifier 250. The O/W emulsion was added to a beaker containing 70 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer solution and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours to allow the methylene chloride to evaporate and for the nanocarriers to form. A portion of the nanocarriers was washed by transferring the nanocarrier suspension to a centrifuge tube and centrifuging at 75,600xg and 4 °C for 50 min, removing the supernatant, and re-suspending the pellet in phosphate buffered saline. The washing procedure was repeated, and the pellet was re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline for a final nanocarrier dispersion of about 10 mg/mL. Nanocarrier size was determined by dynamic light scattering. The amount of rapamycin in the nanocarrier was determined by HPLC analysis. The total dry-nanocarrier mass per mL of suspension was determined by a gravimetric method. Effective Diameter (nm) Rapamycin Content (% w/w) 241 11.5 Suppression of Intravenously-Induced Anaphylactic Reactions using Tolerogenic Nanocarriers Control Balb/c age-matched (5-6 weeks) female mice (dO) were left naive or injected twice intraperitoneously (i.p., dO an d5) with 5pg of whole Ovalbumin protein with 40 pg of Alum (OVA+Alum). Other groups received a similar injection but 100pg of Rapamycin were injected free in solution i.v. or contained in 0.9mg of synthetic nanocarriers i.p. (admixed to the OVA+Alum), intragastrically (i.g.) intravenously (i.v.) (tail vein) or subcutaneously (hind limb). Fifteen days later all animals were challenged with a bolus of OVA i.v. (25pg). As expected, animals that were not immunized did not react to the OVA infusion whereas a strong anaphylaxis reaction was recorded in untreated immunized animals as shown in Fig. 3. Treatment of the animals with free rapamycin or synthetic nanocarriers i.g. did not reduce the anaphylactic reaction whereas providing the synthetic nanocarriers i.v., i.p. or s.c. abolished it. These results show that compositions provided herein when administered concomitantly with a protein can reduce or prevent anaphylaxis induced by an infusion of the protein. Anaphylaxis scores were determined by three independent observers as follows: 0=ηο symptom, l=lethargy, 2=lethargy and inability to right, 3=moribund. The bars represent the mean +/- standard error.

The O/W emulsion was added to an open beaker containing 70 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer solution (60 mL). Three additional, identical O/W emulsions were prepared and added to the same beaker as the first. These were then stirred at room temperature for 2 hours to allow the dichloromethane to evaporate and for the nanocarriers to form. A portion of the nanocarriers was washed by transferring the nanocarrier suspension to centrifuge tubes and centrifuging at 75,600xg and 4 °C for 35 minutes, removing the supernatant, and re-suspending the pellet in PBS IX. The wash procedure was repeated and then the pellet was re-suspended in PBS IX to achieve a nanocarrier suspension having a nominal concentration of 10 mg/mL on a polymer basis.

Effective Diameter (nm) Ovalbumin Content (% w/w) 164 5.81 NP[GSK1059615] Materials and Methods Materials GSK1059615 was purchased from MedChem Express (11 Deer Park Drive, Suite 102D Monmouth Junction, NJ 08852), product code ΗΥ-12036. PLGA with a lactide:glycolide ratio of 1:1 and an inherent viscosity of 0.24 dL/g was purchased from Lakeshore Biomaterials (756 Tom Martin Drive, Birmingham, AL 35211), product code 5050 DLG 2.5Α. PLA-PEG-OMe block co-polymer with a methyl ether terminated PEG block of approximately 5,000 Da and an overall inherent viscosity of 0.26 DL/g was purchased from Lakeshore Biomaterials (756 Tom Martin Drive, Birmingham, AL 35211; Product Code 100 DL mPEG 5000 5Κ-Ε). Cellgro phosphate buffered saline IX pH 7.4 (PBS IX) was purchased from Coming (9345 Discovery Blvd. Manassas, VA 20109), product code 21-040-CV. Method Solutions were prepared as follows: Solution 1: PLGA (125 mg), and PLA-PEG-OMe (125 mg), were dissolved in 10 mL of acetone. Solution 2: GSK1059615 was prepared at 10 mg in 1 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (ΝΜΡ). Nanocarriers were prepared by combining Solution 1 (4 mL) and Solution 2 (0.25 mL) in a small glass pressure tube and adding the mixture drop wise to a 250 mL round bottom flask containing 20 mL of ultra-pure water under stirring. The flask was mounted onto a rotary evaporation device, and the acetone was removed under reduced pressure. A portion of the nanocarriers was washed by transferring the nanocarrier suspension to centrifuge tubes and centrifuging at 75,600 ref and 4 °C for 50 minutes, removing the supernatant, and re-suspending the pellet in PBS IX. The washing procedure was repeated, and the pellet was re-suspended in PBS IX to achieve a nanocarrier suspension having a nominal concentration of 10 mg/mL on a polymer basis. The washed nanocarrier solution was then filtered using 1.2pm PES membrane syringe filters from Pall, part number 4656. An identical nanocarrier solution was prepared as above, and pooled with the first after the filtration step. The homogenous suspension was stored frozen at -20°C. Nanocarrier size was determined by dynamic light scattering. The amount of GSK1059615 in the nanocarrier was determined by UV absorption at 351nm. The total dry-nanocarrier mass per mL of suspension was determined by a gravimetric method. Effective Diameter (nm) GSK1059615 Content (% w/w) 143 1.02 C57BL/6 age-matched (5-6 weeks) female mice were injected i.v. in the tail vein on days -21 and -14 with saline (No Treatment), 1.1 mg of whole Ovalbumin-loaded nanocarriers (NP[OVA]) combined to either 1.2mg of rapamycin-containing nanocarriers (NP[Rapa]) or 8mg of GSK1059615-loaded nanocarriers (NP[GSK1059615]). At day 0 all animals were injected s.c. in the hind limbs with 25pg of particulate OVA (pOVA) admixed to 2pg of CpG followed by injections of just 25pg pOVA on days 7 and 14. Antibody titers were measured on day 21. In absence of any treatment, the animals developed a robust immune response against OVA that can be measured by the anti-OVA IgG antibody titers. The antibody titers at day 21 shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that 2 doses of synthetic tolerogenic nanocarriers administered concomitantly with encapsulated OVA in the same solution (NP[OVA]+NP[Rapa] or NP[GSK1059615]) were effective in reducing antibody formation to OVA even after 1 injection of OVA+CpG and 2 injections of OVA alone. These results show that encapsulated immunosuppressants (such as rapamycin and GSK1059615]) when concomitantly delivered with a protein can prevent antibody formation to that protein for multiple challenges and periods of time, such an effect is helpful in reducing or preventing the occurrence of anaphylaxis. Example 8: Allergenic IgE-Mediated Anaphylaxis versus IgG-Mediated Anaphylaxis (Prophetic) Subjects that have allergies to latex and subjects that have presented with anaphylaxis following infusion of von Willebrand’s factor (“vWF”) are recruited for a set of pharmacodynamic studies. Anaphylaxis is induced in the two sets of subjects, and blood samples are taken before, during, and following anaphylactic episodes. The blood samples are assayed for increased Τ cell IL4R-a expression, and decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression. In latex allergenic subjects, increased Τ cell IL4R-a expression, without decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression is characterized as being indicative of allergenic IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. In vWF sensitized subjects, decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression, without Τ cell IL4R-a expression is characterized as being indicative of IgG-mediated anaphylaxis. Example 9: Monoclonal Antibody-Induced Anaphylaxis (Prophetic) Subjects are repeatedly exposed to infliximab (REMICADE), and any presentation of anaphylaxis in the subjects is noted. Blood samples are taken from the subjects before, during, and following anaphylactic episodes. The blood samples are assayed for increased Τ cell IL4R-a expression, and decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression. Decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression, without Τ cell IL4R-a expression is characterized as being indicative of IgG-mediated anaphylaxis. Example 10: Messenger RNA-Induced Anaphylaxis (Prophetic) Modified mRNA encoding erythropoietin is prepared according to US Patent application 2013/0115272 to de Fougerolles et al. (“mmRNA”). Subjects are repeatedly exposed to mmRNA, and any presentation of anaphylaxis in the subjects is noted. Blood samples are taken from the subjects before, during, and following anaphylactic episodes. The blood samples are assayed for increased Τ cell IL4R-a expression, and decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression. Decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression, without Τ cell IL4R-a expression is characterized as being indicative of IgG-mediated anaphylaxis. Example 11: Antigen-Specific Tolerogenic Responses to Chicken Ovalbumin with Nanocrytalline Rapamycin (Prophetic) C57BL/6 age-matched (5-6 weeks) female mice are injected i.v. in the tail vein on days -21 and -14 with saline (No Treatment) or l.lmg of whole Ovalbumin and 1.2mg of nanocrystalline rapamycin. At day 0 all animals are injected s.c. in the hind limbs with 25pg of particulate OVA (pOVA) admixed to 2pg of CpG followed by injections of just 25pg pOVA on days 7 and 14. Antibody titers are measured on day 21. In the absence of any treatment, the animals develop a robust immune response against OVA that can be measured by the anti-OVA IgG antibody titers. A reduction in OVA-specific IgG antibodies in the animals that received OVA in combination with nanocrystalline rapamycin indicates that the nanocrystal-form of the immunosuppressant when concomitantly delivered with antigen can prevent antibody formation to the antigen for multiple challenges and periods of time and can be useful in reducing or preventing anaphylaxis. Example 12: Reduction of Monoclonal Antibody-Induced Anaphylaxis with Nanocarriers (Prophetic) Subjects are repeatedly exposed to infliximab (REMICADE). Control groups are left untreated (No Treatment) whereas three other groups are treated with synthetic nanocarriers attached to GSK1059615 (NP[GSK]). Blood samples are taken from the subjects before, during, and following anaphylactic episodes. The extent of anaphylaxis in response to REMICADE is assessed and the titer of REMICADE-specific IgG antibody titers in the blood of the animals is quantified. The blood samples are also assayed for increased Τ cell IL4R-a expression, and decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression. A reduction in the symptoms of anaphylaxis and/or the titer of anti-REMICADE IgG antibodies in the animals that were exposed to REMICADE concomitantly with nanocarriers attached to GSK1059615 as compared to animals that did not received the nanocarrier compositions indicates that the nanocarriers attached to GSK1059615 when concomitantly delivered with an antigen, such as REMICADE, is able to reduce or prevent anaphylaxis. Example 13: Allergenic IgE-Mediated Anaphylaxis versus IgG-Mediated Anaphylaxis (Prophetic) Subjects that have allergies to latex and subjects that have presented with anaphylaxis following infusion of von Willebrand’s factor (“vWF”) are recruited for a set of pharmacodynamic studies. Anaphylaxis is induced in the two sets of subjects in the presence or absence of nanocrystalline rapamycin, and blood samples are taken before, during, and following anaphylactic episodes. The blood samples are assayed for increased Τ cell IL4R-a expression, and decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression. In latex allergenic subjects, increased Τ cell IL4R-a expression, without decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression is characterized as being indicative of allergenic IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. In vWF sensitized subjects, decreased blood neutrophil FRIII expression, without Τ cell IL4R expression is characterized as being indicative of IgG-mediated anaphylaxis. A reduction in vWF-specific responses in the subjects that received nanocrystalline rapamycin as compared to the subjects that did not, indicates that the nanocrystalline immunosuppressant is able to reduce or prevent anaphylaxis. Example 14: Messenger RNA-Induced Anaphylaxis (Prophetic) Modified mRNA encoding erythropoietin is prepared according to US Patent application 2013/0115272 to de Fougerolles et al. (“mmRNA”). Subjects are repeatedly exposed to mmRNA in the presence or absence of nanocrystalline rapamycin, and any presentation of anaphylaxis in the subjects is noted. Blood samples are taken from the subjects before, during, and following anaphylactic episodes. The blood samples are assayed for increased Τ cell IL4R-a expression, and decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression. Decreased blood neutrophil FcyRIII expression, without Τ cell IL4R-a expression is characterized as being indicative of IgG-mediated anaphylaxis. A reduction in mmRNA-specific responses in the subjects that received nanocrystalline rapamycin as compared to the subjects that did not, indicates that the nanocrystalline immunosuppressant is able to reduce or prevent anaphylaxis. 1.
