PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ANAGLIPTIN OR ITS SALTS Field of Invention The present invention direct to a process for the preparation of Anagliptin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and intermediates. In the particular aspect, present invention provides an industrially advantageous process for the preparation of Anagliptin. Background of the invention The drug compound having the adopted name "Anagliptin" has chemical name,N-[2-({2- [(2S)-2-Cyanopyrrolidin-l-yl]-2-oxoethyl}amino)-2-methylpropyl]-2-methylpyrazolo [1,5-a] pyrimidine-6-carboxamide; and has the structural formula I: Formula I The pharmaceutical product Suini® tablets contain Anagliptin as active ingredient. Anagliptin is a DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitor useful for the treatment of diabetes. US Patent No. 7,345, 180 describes Anagliptin and process for the preparation thereof. The process of US' 180 involves reaction of 2-methylpyrazolo [1, 5-a] pyrimidin-6-yl with (S)-l-(2'-Chloroacetyl) pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile in presence of potassium carbonate and sodium iodide in acetone for a period of 8 hours at room temperature. Kato Noriyasu et al in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry 19(23), 2011, 7221-7227 reported synthesis of Anagliptin hydrochloride. The process involves selective protection of 2-amino-2-methylpropylamine with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate and condensation with (S)-l-(2-chloroacetyl) pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile. After deprotection of the BOC group, the amino pyrrolidine is condensed with pyrimidine acid in tetrahydrofuran in presence of N, N-carbonyldiimidazole to give Anagliptin which is converted to Anagliptin hydrochloride using hydrochloric acid in 1 , 4-dioxan. Other reported processes in WO 2011/075699, WO 2006/060122, WO 2009/047240, WO 2011/026241, and WO 2011/006074, JP 2010/064982, Freire Felix et. al., in Journal of the American Chemical Society, 131(23), 7970-7972; 2009, Isfort, Christian Schulze et al., in Chemistry - A European Journal, 13(8), 2344-2357; 2007, disclosed the compound Boc-aminopyrrolidine , which is referred as formula VIII in the present application.. Moreover the reported processes suffers one or the other problems like formation of impurities, longer duration of reaction, use of number of solvents, use of bases, etc and made the process expensive. The reported processes for preparing the compound of formula VIII, Boc- aminolyrollidine by, Kato Noriyasu et al., in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 19(23), 7221-7227; 2011 and US 7,345, 180, involves condensation using potassium carbonate in the acetone. However, the prior art process has disadvantages including formation of dimer of pyrrolidine of Formula A more than 10%. The reported processes involve protection and deprotection which are tedious and increases the steps and the cost of process, making it lengthy and cumbersome. Hence there is a need to develop a simple and short process which would be cost effective and commercially viable. The reported processes also suffer from disadvantages such as use of number of multiple reagents, solvents, low yield and purity of the key intermediate, e.g. Boc- aminopyrrolidine. To make intermediate with lower impurity and removal of carry forward impurities require tedious purification process at final API or its intermediate stages. The inventors while developing the process of Anagliptin come across the process which involves the reaction of 2-methylpyrazolo[l,5-a] pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acid with 2- methyl- 1 ,2-propane diamine, which reacts further with l-(2-chloroacetyl)-2S-pyrrolidine carbonitrile to get Anagliptin or its salts in a very simple steps.
