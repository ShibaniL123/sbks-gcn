4-[7-({7-[2-Methoxy-4-trifluoromethylphenyl]-6-methylthieno[3,2-d]pyrimi din-2-yl}amino)-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-4-yl]piperidin-3-ol (Compound 17)
Preparation of compound 17-c.
1 M Solutionof borane in tetrahydrofuran (15.8 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of compound 15-c (1 g, 3.16 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) at 0°C. After the addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring was continued for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0°C again, and 2 Maqueous sodium hydroxide solution was added dropwise to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture to 10, and then 30% hydrogen peroxide (1 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and the stirring was continued for 16 hours. The separated organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 1: 1) to deliver a pale yellow solid 17-c(653 mg, yield: 62%).
