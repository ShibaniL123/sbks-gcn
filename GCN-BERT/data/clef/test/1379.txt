3h-
To a pear-shaped flask containing 3-8 (100 mg, 0.35 mmol, 1.0 equiv) under argon atmosphere was added dichloromethane (5 mL), followed by triethylamine (0.10 mL, 0.70 mmol, 2 equiv) then cyclopropylcarbonyl chloride (0.06 mL, 0.70 mmol, 2 equiv) and stirred at room temperature. After 12 hours, solvent was removed and remaining residue was purified by flash chromatography using a linear gradient from 20% ethyl acetate and 80% hexanes to 60% ethyl acetate and 40% hexanes, yielding intermediate 3-9 (65 mg, 0.18 mmol, 52% yield). Product was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR in CDCl3.
