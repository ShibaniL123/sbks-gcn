The present invention relates to a process for preparing a polypropylene-based object having an increased surface energy, according to claim 1. The invention further relates to a polypropylene resin as used in said process, according to claim 11, to a composition for use in said polypropylene resin, according to claim 12, to a polypropylene-based object, in particular a polypropylene-based film, obtainable by said process, according to claim 13, as well as to a multi-layer structure comprising the polypropylene-based object, according to claim 15. Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of a specific compound as a surface energy retention agent, according to claim 16. Polypropylene-based films (hereinafter also referred to as “PP films”) are extensively used in e.g. food packaging applications, mainly in the form of multilayer structures. These films are mostly manufactured by using either a cast mono-axial stretching process (leading to cast polypropylene, so-called “CPP”) or a bioriented stretching process (leading to biaxially oriented polypropylene, so-called “BOPP”). The manufactured films can then be coated with a particular additional layer in order to provide additional properties not inherent to the PP films. For example, an aluminium layer can be coated onto the surface of a PP film to balance the low vapour barrier properties of the latter. The resulting multilayer structure can be used for packaging food sensitive to humidity, e.g. potato chips. Prior to the coating, the PP film is generally subjected to a surface treatment for increasing its surface energy and thus improving adhesion with the additional layer. Different techniques can be used for this surface energy increasing treatment step, involving corona discharge treatment, plasma treatment or even surface flaming. The extent of the resulting increase in surface energy of the PP film can be assessed by measuring the dyne level. A non-treated PP film shows a dyne level of about 32 to 34 dyne/cm, whereas a typical corona discharge treatment as used to treat CPP or BOPP to metallization grades increases the dyne level to above 45 dyne/cm. However, such an increased dyne level is only temporary and with time decreases to the original dyne level of 32 to 34 dyne/cm. The coating of the treated PP film must thus be performed within a relatively narrow time frame in order to provide a sufficient surface energy and thus adhesion to the addition layer. In order to allow for a higher flexibility with regard to the coating after the surface energy increasing treatment step, it would be desirable to retain the increased surface energy for a longer duration. One approach for achieving an improved response to a surface energy increasing treatment is disclosed in US 2010/0261016, which relates to the process for the production of a polypropylene article comprising the step of providing a polypropylene comprising metallocene-catalyzed polyethylene, subsequently forming an article, and subjecting said article to a treatment that increases surface energy. This process has however the drawback that apart from polypropylene an additional polymeric component in the form of the metallocene-catalyzed polyethylene is required, which renders the process more complex. Also, the properties of the resulting polymeric blend are relatively difficult to control due to the presence of the further polymeric component. It is, thus, an object of the present invention to provide a simple and safe process for preparing a polypropylene-based object, and in particular a PP film, having an increased surface energy, said process allowing the increased surface energy to be retained for a longer duration than with a conventional process. The object of the present invention is solved by the process according to claim 1. Preferred embodiments are given in the dependent claims. The present invention thus relates to a process comprising the subsequent steps of a) providing a polypropylene resin,b) forming an object of said polypropylene resin, andc) subjecting the surface of the object to a surface energy increasing treatment step. According to claim 1, the polypropylene resin used comprises A) at least one secondary antioxidant of formula (I) in which n is 0 or 1,each R may be the same or different and is an unsubstituted phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted by one or two alkyl groups having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, andX is a residue of a monofunctional or difunctional phenyl group, diphenyl group, diphenyl ether group or dibenzofuranyl group, and/or of formula (II) in which R1 is C12-C20-alkyl or phenyl substituted with C1-C6-alkyl groups. In general, a secondary antioxidant (also referred to as A/O2) is an antioxidant that stabilizes a polymer by reducing hydroperoxides, which are formed in the course of an auto-oxidation process, to form stable alcohols. The suitability of the compound according to formula (I) as a secondary antioxidant has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,633, the disclosure of which is incorporated herewith in its entirety by reference. It has now surprisingly been found that when using a compound according to formula (I) and/or formula (II) in a polypropylene resin, the increased surface energy achieved by subjecting the object to a surface energy increasing treatment, such as corona discharge treatment, can be retained for a longer duration than when said compound is absent. The compound thus acts as a surface energy retention agent. This surface energy retention allows for a much higher flexibility with regard to the coating of the object. A “refresher” treatment, as e.g. referred to in US 2010/0261016, for restoring the increased surface energy can, thus, be omitted. Consequently, additional time and cost that typically accompany such a refresher treatment can be avoided. Ultimately, the present invention, thus, allows a multi-layer structure complying with highest quality standards to be achieved in a very cost-efficient manner. Given the low toxicity of the compound according to formula (I), the multi-layer structures can promptly be used for e.g. the packaging of food and/or a pharmaceutical/medicinal product. The term “polypropylene” as used in the context of the present invention is to be interpreted broadly and encompasses polypropylene homopolymers as well as random copolymers and heterophasic copolymers of propylene. The random copolymers and heterophasic copolymers are copolymers of propylene and at least one further comonomer, said comonomer being preferably ethylene and/or at least one alpha-olefin having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, such as 1-butene, 1-hexene or 1-octen. As mentioned, the groups R in formula (I) above may be the same or different, but are preferably identical. It is further preferred that R is a dialkyl phenyl group, more preferably a 2,4-dialkyl phenyl group, particularly one in which the 2-alkyl group is branched. It is further preferred that the 4-alkyl group is also branched; the most preferred R group is 2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl. Preferably, the polypropylene resin comprises a mixture of components falling within the definition of A) according to claim 1. More preferably, it comprises the product of condensing 4 mols of 2,4-di-tert.-butylphenol per mol of the product of the Friedel-Crafts reaction of 2 mols of phosphorus trichloride per mol of biphenyl, as described, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,075,163, the disclosure of which, particularly column 1, line 13 to column 4, line 9 and Example 12, is incorporated herein by reference. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the polypropylene resin comprises a mixture composed of: i) 60-65 parts of the diphosphonite of formula (1x) ii) 10-15 parts of the monophosphonite of formula (1y) iii) 10-15 parts of the phosphite of formula/1z) iv) up to 3.5 parts of 2,4-di-tert.butylphenol; v) up to 1% of inorganic chloride; vi) up to 0.5% of volatile matters; and vii) up to 5% of the compound of the formula This mixture of components i)-vii) is commercially available as Hostanox® P-EPQ from CLARIANT International Ltd., Switzerland, which is particularly suitable for the present invention. In the foregoing description of Hostanox® P-EPQ, parts and percentages are by weight based on 100 parts, by weight, of total components i)-vii). In another embodiment of the invention, the at least one secondary antioxidant A) is of the formula (II) in which R1 is C12-C20-alkyl or phenyl substituted with C1-C6-alkyl groups. Preferably, R1 is a C18H37 alkyl group, known as Ultranox® 618, or R1 is a phenyl group substituted with two tert.-butyl groups, preferably in 2,4-position, known as Ultranox® 626. Preferably, the total amount of the at least one secondary antioxidant A ranges from 0.01 wt.-% to 0.5 wt.-%, preferably from 0.03 wt.-% to 0.2 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the polypropylene resin, thus leading to an optimal retention of the increased surface energy. Besides the above described effect of improving the retention of an increased surface energy of the object, the compound of formula I being a secondary antioxidant also contributes to the stability of the polypropylene resin. This is on the one hand due to the compound functioning as a stabilizer to protect the polyolefin from thermal degradation while it is exposed to high processing temperatures, thus ensuring excellent colour stability as well as constant melt viscosity. On the other hand, the compound also acts as a long-term stabilizer, e.g. as a co-stabilizer in combination with a primary antioxidant, such as a sterically hindered phenol or a sterically hindered amine. According to a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polypropylene resin further comprises B) at least one primary antioxidant (also referred to as A/O1), in particular selected from the group consisting of a sterically hindered phenol or a sterically hindered amine. If the at least one primary antioxidant B is a sterically hindered phenol, it may be one of the known 2,6-dialkyl phenol derivatives, particularly a 2,6-di-tert-butylphenyl or 2-methyl-6-tert-butylphenyl derivative.

Other techniques, such as plasma treatment and/or surface flaming, are also thinkable. The advantages obtained by the process of the present invention become particularly apparent if the object prepared is coated with a layer after the surface energy increasing treatment step, since improved adhesion of the layer can be provided for a longer time frame after the surface energy increasing treatment. The layer may for example be an aluminium layer for increasing the vapour barrier properties of e.g. the PP film. Any other layer for imparting properties not inherent to polypropylene may likewise be applied to the object; this includes a layer for printing the surface. The layer coated onto the object can also be an intermediate layer, which in the final multilayer structure is arranged between the object and a further layer. Besides the process described above, the present invention also relates to a polypropylene resin as used in the process as well as to a composition for use in a polypropylene resin, e.g. as an antioxidant base package composition. Said polypropylene resin and said composition, respectively, thus comprises A) at least one secondary antioxidant of formula (I) and/or formula (II), said secondary antioxidant being optionally in combination with at least one further secondary antioxidant A1 selected from the group consisting of a phosphite, phosphonite or other phosphorous based antioxidant. Optionally, the polypropylene resin and the composition, respectively, further comprise B) at least one primary antioxidant and/or radical scavenger, in particular selected from the group consisting of a sterically hindered phenol or a sterically hindered amine, and C) at least one acid scavenger, in particular selected from the group consisting of a hydrotalcite, a metal stearate and a metal oxide. As will be shown in more detail in the context of the examples, the present invention allows for achieving a polypropylene object, the surface of which has a dyne level of at least 36 dyne/cm also after at least 14 days of the surface energy increasing treatment step. According to a further aspect, the present invention thus also relates to a polypropylene-based object obtainable by the above process, the surface of which having at least 14 days after the surface energy increasing treatment step a dyne level of at least 36 dyne/cm, preferably at least 37 dyne/cm, more preferably at least 38 dyne/cm. According to still a further aspect, the present invention further relates to a multi-layer structure comprising said polypropylene-based object and a layer applied thereon. The term “multi-layer structure” is in the context of the present invention to be understood as a structure comprising at least one layer coated onto an object, such as a film. As mentioned above, the multi-layer structure is preferably used for the packaging of food. Other applications, such as the packaging for textiles or medicinal/pharmaceutical products, are also thinkable. As mentioned, the compound according to formula (I) and/or formula (II) acts as a surface energy retention agent, i.e. an agent that retains the surface energy, e.g. increased by a corona discharge treatment. According to still a further aspect, the present invention thus also relates to the use of the compound according to formula (I) and/or formula (II) as a surface energy retention agent. The present invention further relates to the use of the compound according to formula (I) and/or formula (II) in combination with component B) and C) as a surface energy retention agent.

Films of a thickness of 50 microns are blown and the films obtained are exposed to a corona treater. Dyne levels are measured immediately after corona discharge treatment and regularly for 28 days. Specifically, the dyne level determination using a dyne level pen has been performed as follows: The test fluid has been spread from the felt tip pen over an area of approximately 7 cm of the test specimen and the time it takes for the continuous film to break into droplets has been measured. Breaking of the fluid into droplets in less than 2 seconds indicates a lack of wetting, and a lower numbered test fluid was subsequently used, whereas for a fluid which remained intact for longer than 2 seconds, a higher number test fluid was subsequently used, until the lowest number at an optimum dwell time of 2 seconds was established.
