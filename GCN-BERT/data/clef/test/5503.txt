PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF ALIPHATIC DIALKYL ESTERS FROM VEGETABLE OILS DESCRIPTION This invention relates to a process for obtaining saturated aliphatic dialkyl esters comprising the step 1 ) of reacting a triglycerides mixture containing at least a triglyceride of at least one saturated dicarboxylic acid with an al iphatic alcohol in the presence of one or more catalysts capable of catalysing the esterifieation and transesterification reactions, and the step 2) of separating the al iphatic dialkyl esters of dicarboxyl ic acids from the reaction mixture obtained at the end of step 1). The process according to this invention makes it possible to obtain highly pure saturated dicarboxylic acid derivatives from vegetable oils, which can advantageously be used for polymerisation, simply and economically. Patent Applications WO 2008/138892 and WO 201 1/080296 describe batch and continuous processes for obtaining dicarboxylic acids, in particular azelaic acid, from vegetable oi ls. In these processes, after the monocarboxylie acids obtained by oxidative cleavage of the double bonds have been separated out, the triglycerides containing azelaic acids are subjected to hydrolysis and subsequent treatments to separate the azelaic acid from the glycerine and the long chain saturated monocarboxylie acids initially present in the triglycerides which are released during the hydrolysis reaction. WO 2008/138892 describes a series of hot water extractions to separate azelaic acid and glycerine from the saturated monocarboxylie acids, followed by crystall isation of the acid by cool ing the aqueous solution. In WO 201 1/080296 the glycerine is separated out by centrifuging the aqueous phase, and subsequently the organic phase containing azelaic acid undergoes thin film evaporation and distillation in a column to separate the azelaic acid from the saturated monocarboxylie acids. However the first process has the disadvantage that it requires very large quantities of water for the extraction of azelaic acid, whose non-negligible solubil ity in water, ev en at ambient temperature, helps to reduce the yield of product recovery; the second process requires complex and costly operations to purify the azelaic acid from long chain saturated monocarboxyl ie acids such as palmitic and stearic acids which interfere should it be used in polymerisation reactions. Processes of esterifieation of triglycerides mixtures containing triglycerides of dicarboxylic acids are described to prepare ol igomeric structures in the patent appl ications WO 2012/085012 and WO 2013/189915. Limited amounts of alky 1 esters are therein obtained as by-products. With the process according to this invention it is instead possible to obtain dicarboxylic acid derivatives such as al iphatic dialkyl esters from vegetable oils in high yields and with high purity, and these can readily be used for polymerisation reactions. These aliphatic dialkyl esters are readily separated from glycerine and long chain acid monoesters, appreciably simplifying the operations of separating the products. This also makes it possible to recover high concentrations of the glycerine obtained as a by-product. This invent ion relates in particular to a process for the production of aliphatic dialkyl esters in which triglycerides containing dicarboxyl ic acids undergo a reaction esterifying the free carboxyl groups and a reaction transesteri fying the carboxyl groups bound to the glycerol. Depending upon the catalysts selected, it is possible for these reactions to be performed simultaneously or separately in two successive stages. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of the process according to the invention. Figure 2 shows a flow diagram of a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention which includes three preliminary steps to obtain triglycerides containing at least one dicarboxylic acid (steps a), b), c)). Object of the present inv ention is a process for preparing aliphatic dialkyl esters of saturated dicarboxyl ic acids from a triglycerides mixture containing - at least one triglyceride of at least one saturated dicarboxylic acid and - at least 65% of giycerides of formula Rx - O - CH2 - CH(ORy) - CH2 - O - Rz , wherein Rx, Ry, Rz arc independently selected from the group consisting of I I , C(,-CM monocarboxylic acid residues and C<,-CM dicarboxylic acid residues, and wherein at least one of Rx, Ry, Rz is a CVCYi dicarboxylic acid residue, comprising the steps of: 1) reacting with an al iphatic alcohol the said triglycerides mixture ,in the presence of one or more catalysts capable of catalysing the esterification. and/or transesteri fication reactions; 2) separating the aliphatic dialkyl esters of saturated dicarboxyl ic acids from the reaction mixture obtained at the end of step 1). The percentage content of the abov e mentioned giycerides is intended as the % area measured by H PLC- MS analysis operating in gradient mode with ESI (+/-) ionization, using a Mass Spectrometer equipped with a Kinetex Phenomenex 2.6μπι C8 I OOA 100x2. lmm column at 40°C and PDA detector, with Formic acid 1% (A) and CH3CN (B) as solvent and the follow ing gradient: 0 min (A/B=80/20), 2 min (A/B=80/20), 40 min (A/B=5/95), 50 min (A/B=5/95), 55 min (A/B=80/20); flow 0.5 mi/min; Ful l scan 1 00-2000 Da. The reaction mi ture obtained at the end of step 1) contains glycerine, aliphatic dialkyiesters of dicarboxylic acids and possibly aliphatic esters of monocarboxyiic acids present in the starting triglycerides. Step 2) is intended to separate the said aliphatic dialkyl esters of dicarboxylic acids from the glycerine and the said aliphatic esters of monocarboxyiic acids. The peculiar composition of the starting triglycerides mixture allows to provide the separated aliphatic dialkyiesters of saturated dicarboxylic acids in particularly high yields. Advantageously, the said yield is equal to or greater than 60% by weight with respect to the theoretical dicarboxylic acid content of the triglycerides mixture of step 1). More advantageously, said yield is equal to or greater than 70% by weight. The at least one triglyceride of at least one dicarboxylic acid which undergoes the esterification and transesterification reactions of step 1) of this process is a triglyceride in which one or more of the oxygens in the hydroxy! groups of the glycerol residue are bound to an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid residue. Where one molecule of triglyceride contains two or three dicarboxylic acid residues, these dicarboxylic acid residues may be the same or different. The said dicarboxylic acids are saturated and are preferably of the alpha-omega type. In step 1) of the process the triglycerides of at least one dicarboxylic acid are caused to react with one or more aliphatic alcohols. Typical examples of aliphatic alcohols are linear or branched chain Ci-Cio monoaicohois. C r C alcohols are preferred and C1-C4 alcohols are ev en more preferred. Advantageously primary alcohols arc used. Examples of preferred alcohols arc methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol. More preferably n-butanol is used. The esterification and transesterification reactions performed in the course of step 1) of this process may be performed simultaneously in a single stage or in two successive stages. When the reaction of esteri tying the free acid groups and the reaction of transesteri lying the acid groups bound to the glycerol are performed simultaneously, a strong acid is used as the catalyst for step 1). For the purposes of this inv ention, the strong acid is preferably selected from hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, nitric acid, aikyisulfonic acids, arylsuifonic acids, sulfonic resins or acid earths such as montmorillonites of the KSF type, and B rousted inorganic or organic acids having a dissociation constant Ka > 55 (pKa < - 1 .74) at 25°C. The catalyst is more preferably selected from hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, nitric acid, aikyisulfonic acids, arylsulfonic acids, sulfonic resins or acid earths such as montmorillonites of the KSF type. The quantity of catalyst may vary depending upon the type of acid preselected and in general comprises between 0. 1 and 5% by weight with respect to the mixture which has to be esterified. The simultaneous esterification and transesterification reaction is performed using an excess of al iphatic alcohol with respect to the carboxylic groups present in the mixture at an internal temperature preferably comprised between 80°C and the reflux temperature of the alcohol in the reaction mixture, which is normally up to a maximum of 200°C, and removing the water which forms in the course of the esterification. Those skil led in the art will be capable of identifying suitable temperature conditions on the basis of the quantity and type of alcohol present. In the case of n-butanol a temperature of between 80 and 160°C, preferably between 120°C and 150°C, is used. On completion of the reaction the excess alcohol is distilled off under vacuum at a temperature of preferably betw een 50-100°C. When the reaction for esterification of the free acid groups is performed separately with respect to the reaction for transesterification of the acid groups bound to the glycerol, it is necessary to use a weak acid as the catalyst for the first stage in step 1) (i.e. the reaction of esterifying the free acid groups). For the purposes of this invention, the weak acid is different from the strong acids and is preferably selected from phosphoric acid, tungstic acid, molybdic acid, phosphotungstic acid, weakly acid montmorillonites (for example of the K- I O type), and organic or inorganic Bronsted acids having a dissociation constant or constants of Ka < 1 x 10 2 (pKa > 2) at 25°C. Preferably the esterification catalyst, is selected from phosphoric acid, tungstic acid, molybdic acid, phosphotungstic acid or weakly acid montmoril lonites (for example of the K- ! O type). The quantity of catalyst may vary depending upon the type of acid preselected and in general lies between 0. 1 and 5% by weight with respect to the mixture which has to be esterified. The esterification reaction is performed using a quantity of al iphatic alcohol which is sufficient to esterify the free carboxylic groups present in the mixture at a temperature which normally corresponds to that of the boiling point of the alcohol, preferably betw een 80 and 200 C, and removing the water which forms in the course of the reaction. On completion of the conversion the temperature is adjusted to a value below the boiling point of the alcohol, a strong base is added together w ith excess alcohol or in any event a sufficient quantity to transesterify with the glycerine, and the temperature is adjusted to the reflux temperature of the mixture for the time required to complete the reaction (second substage in step 1). The strong base used as a catalyst for the second substage in step 1) (i.e. transesterification of the acid groups bound to the glycerol) is preferably selected from the group comprising alkali hydroxides (sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide) and alkali aikoxides (sodium, methylate. potassium, t-butyiate). The quantity of base may depend according to the type selected and should be in sufficient quantity to neutral ise the acid catalyst used during the esterification stage and catalyse the subsequent transesterification; this in general lies between 0.2 and 10% by weight with respect to the mixture which has to be esterified. On completion of the reaction the excess alcohol is distilled off under vacuum at a temperature of preferably between 50 and 100 C. Separation of the glycerine in step 2) of the process according to the invention may take place in different manners depending on how step 1) is performed. In the first case ( i.e. step 1 performed in a single stage ), after the excess alcohol has been distilled off most of the glycerine separates out from the oily plia.se containing the mixture of aliphatic esters as a result of cool ing to ambient temperature and is recovered by, for example, settl ing. The oily phase is washed with water to reduce the acidity and remove the remaining glycerine, and after neutralisation and concentration of the water it can be recovered and pooled with that obtained previously. In the second case (i.e. step 1 performed in two stages ), the distillation residue is normal ly washed with water to recover the glycerine and dehydrated . In any event, once the glycerine has been separated off the remaining reaction mixture mainly contains aliphatic diesters of dicarboxylic acids. Depending upon the composition of the starting material, the reaction mixture may also contain monocarboxyiic acid esters formed fol low ing the transesterification reaction, in addition to a reaction residue containing oligomers. The dicarboxylic acid diesters are therefore separated from such monocarboxyiic acid monoesters, advantageously by distillation under high vacuum conditions. The diesters obtained at the end of step 2) are particularly suitable for use in polymerisation. If used in polymerisation the said diesters may advantageously undergo prel iminary transesterification treatments with diols, for example with butandiol. The starting material suitable for this process is a triglycerides mixture comprising one or more triglycerides containing at least one dicarboxylic acid, which may be the same or different. The said triglycerides mixture comprises also at least 65%, preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 75%, even more preferably at least 80% of glycerides of formula Rx - O - C'H ' - CH(ORy) - CH2 - O - Rz, wherein Rx, Ry, Rz are independently selected from the group consisting of H, C(,-CM monocarboxylic acid residues and C6-C24 dicarboxylic acid residues, and wherein at least one, preferably at least two of Rx, Ry, Rz arc C6-C24 dicarboxylic acid residues. By C(,-C.M dicarboxylic acids arc meant aliphatic diacids, preferably of the alpha-omega type. Suberic acid, azeiaic acid, brassylic acid and their mixtures are particularly preferred. By C6-C24 monocarboxylic acids are meant aliphatic monoacids which may be saturated or unsaturated and substituted or unsubstituted. Preferred unsubstituted monocarboxylic acids arc monoacids having a chain length of palmitic, stearic, oleic, arachidic, behenic and iignoceric acids are particularly preferred. When substituted monocarboxylic acid residues are present, long chain monocarboxyl ic acids having one or more ketone groups and/or hydroxy! groups in non-terminal positions are preferred, and among these C12-C24 hydroxy acids containing at least one secondary hydroxy! group are particularly preferred. Examples of substituted monocarboxylic acids which may be present are 9-hydroxystearic acid, 9-ketostearic acid, 1 0-ketostearic acid, 1 0-hydroxystearic acid, dihydroxypaimitic acid, dihydroxystearic acid, dihydroxyoleic acid, dihydroxyarachidic acid and dihydroxybehenic acid. The content of glycerides with carboxylic acid residues bearing keto groups is preferably below 10% (HPLC-MS area). According to a preferred embodiment, the said mixture comprises less than 5% of glycerides with carboxylic acid residues bearing keto groups. The Number Average Molecular Weight ( Mn) of the said triglycerides mixture is advantageously less than 400 Da when measured by GPC analysis after calibration with polystyrene standard. The said triglycerides containing at least one dicarboxyl ic acid may advantageously be obtained from vegetable oils containing unsaturated carboxylic acids using known means. One example is oxidative reactions cleaving the double bonds present in the unsaturated carboxyl ic acids. These reactions may be performed using one or more oxidising agents such as for example inorganic and organic peroxides, peracids, nitric acid, permanganates, periodates, O2, O3 or mixtures of gases containing them. In particular the mixtures of triglycerides obtained by oxidative cleavage processes of vegetable oils using peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, and (>> or mixtures containing O2 are advantageously used as a starting material for this process. Preferred examples are the processes described in appl ications WO 2008/138892, WO 201 1/080296 or WO 2013/079849 Al . Mixtures of triglycerides containing dicarboxylic acids obtained after step c) of separating out saturated monocarboxyiic acids by means of the processes described in applications WO 2008/138892 and WO 201 1/080296 are particularly preferred. According to a preferred embodiment, the triglycerides containing at least one saturated dicarboxylic acid according to this invention are prepared from vegetable oils containing triglycerides of unsaturated carboxyiic acids by means of a process comprising the steps of: a) causing the unsaturated carboxyiic acid triglycerides to react with an oxidising compound in the presence of a catalyst capable of catalysing the reaction of oxidising the olefin double bond to obtain an intermediate compound containing vicinal diois; b) causing the said intermediate compound to react with oxygen, or a gaseous mixture contain ing oxygen, and a catalyst capable of catalysing the reaction of oxidising the vicinal diols to carboxyl groups in order to obtain (i) saturated monocarboxyiic acids and (ii) triglycerides containing saturated dicarboxyl ic acids; c) separating the saturated monocarboxyiic acids (i) from the triglycerides containing saturated dicarboxylic acids (ii). By vegetable oils containing unsaturated carboxyiic acids are meant either the unmodified product of pressing, or an oil which has undergone chemical or chemical and physical modifications such as for example purification treatments or enzyme enrichment. Examples of vegetable oils are: soya oil, olive oil, castor oil, sunflower oil, thistle oil, safflower oil. peanut oil, maize oil, palm oil, jatropha oil, cuphea seed oil, oils from Brassicaceae such as Crambe abyssinica, Brassica carinata, Bras sic a napus (colza), Lesquerella, and other oils having a high monounsaturated acids content. The use of sunflower oil, thistle oil and oils from Brassicaceae is particularly preferred. Even more preferred is the use of sunflower oil and thistle oil having a high content of oleic acid and oils from Brassicaceae hav ing a high content of erucic acid. The triglycerides may contain both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated carboxyiic acids. Examples of unsaturated carboxyiic acids are: 9-tetradecenoic (myristoieic) acid, 9- hexadecenoic (palmitolcic ) acid, 9-octadecenoic (oleic) acid, 12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic (ricinoleic) acid, 9-eicosenoic (gadoieic) acid, 13-docosenoic (erucic) acid, 1 5-tetracosenoic (neivonic) acid, 9, 12-oetadeeadienoic (linoleic ) acid and 9, 12. 1 5-oetadecatrienoic ( linolenic ) acid. Monounsaturated carboxylic acids are particularly preferred. The use of oleic acid and erucic acid is particularly advantageous in the process according to the invention. As mentioned, the starting triglycerides normally also contain saturated monocarboxylic acids which remain bound to the glycerine together with the dicarboxylic acids (ii) at the end of step c). Generally the triglycerides present in the starting oils contain medium- long chain saturated monocarboxylic acids, i.e. those with a chain length of C\ or more. The oils preferably used may contain triglycerides of long chain saturated monocarboxyl ic acids, i.e. those of Ci2 or more, preferably C14 --C24. In one form of the process for preparing triglycerides containing saturated dicarboxylic acids according to the invention, the catalyst is not remov ed at the end of step a). In a preferred form, step b) is performed without the addition of water other than that in which the catalyst is dissolved. Advantageously the said step b) comprises an aqueous phase and an organic phase with a water diol ratio of less than 1 :3. The oxidising substance used to perform step a) is preferably an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide having concentrations between 30 and 80%, preferably betw een 40 and 70% and even more preferably between 49 and 65%. In step b) the diol resulting from step a ) is caused to react with oxygen or a gaseous mixture containing oxygen. The use of air is particularly adv antageous. Oxygen-enriched air may also be used. The catalyst in step a) belongs to the group of transition elements. Fe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Os, Re, Ti, V, W, Zr and their acids, alkaline salts and complexes are adv antageously used as homogeneous or heterogeneous phase catalysts, possibly in supported or nanostructured form. The use of tungstic acid or phosphotungstic acid is particularly preferred. This catalyst is present in quantities of between 0.03% and 3% in moles, preferably betw een 0.05% and 1.8% in moles and even more preferably betw een 0.06% and 1.5% in moles with respect to the total moles of unsaturated compounds. In a preferred form of the process the catalyst may be fed in the form of a solution in a non-organic solv ent. As far as the catalyst for step b) is concerned, this belongs to the group of transition elements. Ce, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, Re, Os, V and W and their acids, alkaline salts and complexes arc advantageously used as homogeneous or heterogeneous phase catalysts, possibly in supported or nanostructured form. The use of cobalt salts, such as for example acetate, chloride, sulfate, bromide and nitrate, used in quantities betw een 0.05% and 3% in moles, preferably betw een 0.1% and 2% in moles and even more preferably between 0.3% and 1 .5% in moles with respect to the diol produced during step a) is particularly preferred. The use of cobalt acetate and cobalt chloride is particularly preferred. An inorganic acid may be added to the catalyst in step b). Examples of inorganic acids are phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, perchloric acid and their mixtures. A smal l quantity of the intermediate compound obtained at the end of step a) may be added when starting step a) given that the diols present in it encourage activation of the reaction. This intermediate compound may be added in a quantity of < 5%, preferably < 3% by weight with respect to the starting oil . Advantageously, nitrogen or air are caused to flow through in the course of step a) to remove part of the water produced in the process. In this way excessive dilution of H202 is avoided. An alternative to a flow of these gases is evaporation under vacuum. The reaction temperature for step a) and step b) advantageously l ies betw een 45 and 95°C, preferably between 50 and 90°C. The reaction temperature in step a) advantageously lies between 55 and 80 C. The reaction temperature in step b) advantageously lies betw een 55 and 90°C, even more advantageously between 60 and 70°C. Advantageously, the average residence time in the reactor for performing both step a) and step b) is betw een 2 and 8 hours. In a preferred form of the process the intermediate product resulting from step a) is fed directly to the reactor in which step b) is carried out. Step a) is preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure or under slight vacuum. Step b) is preferably carried out with air at a pressure of < 50 atm, preferably < 25 atm. Advantageously the aqueous phase is separated from the organic phase at the end of step b). The aqueous phase contains the catalysts for steps a) and b) which can be recovered and optionally recycled as catalysts for step b). The organic phase is a clear oil comprising a mixture comprising substantial ly (i) free saturated monocarboxyl ic acids formed by the process of oxidative cleavage, and (ii) triglycerides containing saturated dicarboxylic acids, saturated monocarboxylic acids present in the starting mixture, and possibly d i h y d rox y carbox y I i c acids (vicinal diols) formed at the end of step a) and not converted in the course of step b). In a preferred form of the process in which oil having a high oleic acid content is used as a starting material, the organic phase substantially comprises pel argon ic acid and triglycerides of azelaic, palmitic, stearic and dihydroxystearic acids. In another preferred form of the process in which oils having a high erucic acid content are used as a starting material the organic phase substantial ly comprises pelargonic acid and triglycerides of azelaic, brassy lie, palmitic, stearic, dihydroxystearic and dihydroxybehenic acids. In step c) of the process for preparing triglycerides containing dicarboxyiic acids the organic phase obtained as the product of oxidative cleavage is fed to equipment suitable for separating free C5-C10 chain monocarboxylic acids (i) from the reaction mixture comprising triglycerides containing dicarboxyiic acids (ii). The separation is advantageously performed by means of distillation processes. AH distillation processes which do not give rise to strong thermal stress on the mixture of products obtained during step b), such as for example distillation in a flow of steam or in thin film evaporators, are preferred. Advantageously the evaporated mixture of monocarboxylic acids may be further subjected to distillation to obtain C5-C10 monocarboxyl ic acids having a greater degree of purity. In a preferred form of the process the monocarboxylic acids are separated from the mixture containing the triglycerides through the use of a thin film evaporator. One advantageous aspect of the process according to this invention lies in the fact that the distillation residue obtained at the end of step 2) is a high value product which can be directly used in elastomer compositions, for example for the production of tyres. Advantageously this residue finds use in elastomer compositions as an extender oil. On the basis of the type of vegetable oils used for the preparation of triglycerides containing dicarboxyiic acids, di esters of different C2-C24 dicarboxyiic acids may be obtained, such as for example: oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, ad i pic acid, pimel ic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, u n d ec a n d i c a rbox y I i c acid, dodecandicarboxylic acid, brassyiic acid, tetradecandicarboxylic acid or pentadecandicarboxylic acid. Suberic acid, azelaic acid, brassyiic acid and their mixtures are particularly suitable for the purposes of this invention. In a preferred form of the process according to the invention, mainly dibutyl azelate is obtained from esteri lying triglycerides containing dicarboxyi ic acids prepared by oxidative cleavage from oils having a high oleic content with butanol. The process according to this invention may be performed in either batch or continuous mode. Preferably the process is carried out in continuous mode. The process according to the invention will now be described on the basis of non-limiting examples. EXAMPLE 1 (two-stage esteri fication and transesterification ) A mixture main ly comprising triglycerides having an azelaic acid content of 47% by weight obtained as a distillation residue after step c) of the process of oxidative cleavage described in Example 1 of WO2008/138892 (so-called "acid triglyceride" ) was used as the starting material. The HPLC-MS analysis of the mixture revealed the presence of 94% of glycerides of formula Rx - O - CH2 - CTI(ORy) - CH2 - O - Rz, according to the invention, wherein at least one of Rx, Ry and/or Rz is azelaic acid. The kinematic viscosity of the triglycerides mixture at 100°C was 86.8 cSt. Step 1) The following were placed in a 1 000 ml flask with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer and a Marcusson device for the collection of water: 300 g of acid triglyceride - 1 g ol' 85% I LPO., 50 g of n-butanol. The flask was heated under reflux (internal temperature 160°C); the water which formed from the condensation was distilled off, gradually adding a further 1 00 g of alcohol to compensate for that removed from the reaction equilibrium, in such a way as to maintain the temperature of the mixture around 160 C. This was continued for 8 hours until water formation ceased. The temperature was raised to 120°C and the fol lowing were added to the flask: 7 g of potassium t-butylate, 1 50 g of butanol and this was refluxed for 4 hours. Step 2) At the end the excess butanol was distil led off under reduced pressure, the residue was washed several times with w ater to recover the glycerine, it was dehydrated and distilled under vacuum at 1 mm Hg [approximately 133 Pa] to 270°C in distillation apparatus. 250 g of distil late and 1 20 g of residue were obtained (corresponding to a ratio of distillate to the residue of 68/32). The yield of dibutyl azeiate calculated on the content in the distil late was 72%. A polymer grade product was obtained by distillation in a 20 plate column. EXAMPLE 2 (single stage esterification. and transesterification ) Step 1) The fol low ing w ere placed in a 1000 ml flask with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer and Marcusson device to collect the water: 300 g of acid triglyceride obtained as described in Example 1 , - 1 .5 g of 96% H2S04, 200 g of n-butanol . The mixture was heated to an internal temperature of 135°C, distilling off the water which was formed from the condensation. The reaction was stopped after 2.5 hours when water ceased to be produced. Step 2 ) The excess butanol was evaporated off under vacuum, heating to approximately 70°C in distillation apparatus; at the end of this the reaction mass was poured into a separating funnel, and the glycerine was allowed to separate out at ambient temperature. The glycerine was separated off and the oily phase was washed with water until neutral pH. The organic phase was dehydrated under vacuum, and then distil led under a vacuum of I mm Hg until it reached 270°C in distillation apparatus. 290 g of distillate and 125 g of residue were obtained (corresponding to a ratio of distillate to the residue of 70/30). The yield of dibutyl azeiate calculated on the content in the distillate was 80%. EXAMPLE 3 ( single stage esterifieation and transesterification ) Step 1) The following were placed in a 1000 ml flask with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer and Marcusson. device for the col lection of water: 200 g of acid triglyceride obtained as described in Example 1 , - 1.0 g of 96% H2S04, 370g of n-butanol . The mixture was heated to an internal temperature of 135°C, distil ling off the water formed by condensation. The reaction was stopped after 6 hours when water ceased to be produced. Step 2 ) The excess butanol was evaporated off under vacuum, heating to approximately 80°C in distillation apparatus; on completion the reaction mass was poured into a separating funnel, and the glycerine was allowed to separate out at ambient temperature. The glycerine was separated off and the oily phase was washed with water to neutral pH. The organic phase was dehydrated under vacuum, and then distilled under a vacuum of 1 mm Hg until 270°C was reached in distillation apparatus. 195 g of colourless distillate and 76 g of residue were obtained (corresponding to a ratio of distillate to the residue of 72/28). The yield of dibutyl azeiate calculated on the content of the distillate in comparison with the starting triglyceride content was 84%. EXAMPLE 4 (single stage esterification and transesterification ) Step 1) A solution comprising: 200 g of acid triglyceride obtained as described in Example 1 370 g of n-butanoi were fed by means of a peristaltic pump into the bottom of a cy lindrical reactor with a jacket heated to 1 1 5°C and filled with 100 ml of Amberlyst 36 sulfonic resin; at the top of the column a distillation head collected the w ater butanol azeotrope, while the l iquid returned to circulation via the pump. Circulation was continued until water ceased to be produced (approximately 4 hours ). Step 2 ) The excess butanol was evaporated off under vacuum and the residue was treated as described in the preceding example. A dibutyl azeiate yield of 85% was obtained at the end of the distil lation. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE Example 1 of the patent application WO 2012/085012 was reproduced. The HPLC-MS analysis of the mixture of triglycerides after evaporat ion of the free carboxylic acids in a thin film evaporator revealed the presence of 43% (area ) of glyccrides of formula Rx Rx - O - CH ? - CH(ORy) - Cf L - O - Rz, according to the invention, wherein at least one of Rx, Ry and/or Rz is azelaic acid. The kinematic viscosity at 1 00' C of the resulting mixture of triglycerides was 692 cSt. An esterification with butyl alcohol catalysed by sufuric acid was performed and the evaporation of volatile butyl esters allowed to obtain a ratio of distillate to the residue of merely 50/50. 1) reacting with an aliphatic alcohol the said triglycerides mixture, in the presence of one or more catalysts capable of catalysing the esterification and/or transesterification reactions; 2) separating the aliphatic dialkyl esters of saturated dicarboxylic acids from the reaction mixture obtained at the end of step 1). Process according to claim 1 , in which the said triglycerides mixture is obtained from vegetable oils containing unsaturated carboxyl ic acids.
