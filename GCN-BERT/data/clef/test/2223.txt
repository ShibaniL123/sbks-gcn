Currents, as described in the present specification and illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part of the same» The invention consists essentially in the production of convection currents by passing air into and through, a hot zone in separated streams and lading with moisture and distributed, as pointed ont in the claims for novelty following a description containing an explanation in detail of an acceptable form of the invention. The objects of the invention are to facilitate the circulation of convection currents by passing them through enclosures within a chamber maintained at a hlgft temperature and thereby increase the volume of heated air and speed of circulation in proportion to the heat generated and expenditure of fuel; to eliminate the circulation of dust throughout a building and maintain the atmospheres of the interior sweet, clean and wholesome, thus benefitting the health of the occupants and saving deterioration of furniture and foodsj SO to simplify the construction of heating plants and the installation thereof; and generally to provide an efficient and economical heating system for all kinds of buildings» In the drawings, figure 1 is a perspective view of a hot air rumace having the top removed. Figure 2 is a side sectional view of the hot air furnace» Figure 3 is a plan view of the hot air furnace with the top removed» Like numerals of reference indicate ôorresponding parts in. the various figures. «-»<--• on; J-/-, In this invention, for the purpose of giving a clear understanding of the invention, the heating plant for producing the convection currents is descri'bed as a hot air furnace and referring to the drawings, the furnace Is shown as having walls of brick or cementitious matter, as indicated by the numeral 10 with the ash pit door 11 and the fire box door 12. he furnace is constructed in two separate compartments divided by the wall 13, namely main hot compart¬ ment or fire box 14 and the humidifying chamber or water tank compartment 15, the compartment 15 containing the tank.16 having the water connection 17» In the fire box 14 the hollow grate bars or hot air pipes 18 are situated and those extend through the front wall 19 of the furnace in the openings 20 forming air entrances from the furnace room, the other ends of the pipes 18 extending through the rear wall 15 and terminating adjacent to the water container 16 in the tank compartment 15, The fuel 21 rorms the fire bed on the hot air pipes which consistute grate bars and these bars are preferably set at an angle of from 10° to 20° from the horizontal plane of the furnace chamber in order that the air which is heated by the fuel will rise and enter the tank where it is laden with moisture and radiated through a radiation system» The hot air pipe 22 extends from the hot water compartment 15 and branches off into other pipes leading to various parts of the house and the flue 24 from the fire box 14 is connected to a chimney» It will therefore bo seen that in the use of this invention, the fuel is simply laid on the tubular grate bars and the air passing through the furnace chamber ia heated and gathers moisture in the adjoining chamber from which it is directed to the rooms of the house or the building at a uniform temperature and at the same time the dust is eliminated by lading the conveotion currents with moisture at the outset» It is understood that many different fuels may be used, also the heat generating plaiit may differ in form so long as the salient features of the invention remain, namely the heating of the air in tubular passages and directing Its flow to gather moisture for the laying of dust and for humidifying the atmosphere of apartments, halls and public buildings and schools» 2£95o3 WHAT I CLAJM IS: 1. in the production of convection currents, a walled chamber forming a hot zone, tubular passages for heating fluid in close streams extended through said hot zone and a distributing walled chamber contiguous to said tubular passage receiving the heated fluid for circulation» 2.
