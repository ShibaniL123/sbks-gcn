Example 59: Synthesis of compound 11244, N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-phenyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)azetidine-3-carboxamide
N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-phenylazetidine-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (0.050 g, 0.114 mmol), synthesized in step 3 of Example 53, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.039 mL, 0.228 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and 2,2,2-trifluoroacetic anhydride (0.018 mL, 0.125 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2 plate, 20 x 20 x 1 mm; methanol/dichloromethane = 10 %) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.005 g, 8.8%) as a white solid.
