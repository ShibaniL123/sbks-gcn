Clean, high efficient and environmentally friendly gasoline product Technical Field The present invention belongs to the field of oil refining and petrochemical engineering, and relates to a new kind of fuel oil (refined oil) product for internal combustion engine. Background 1. The comparison of diesel engine with gasoline engine Gasoline has a relatively higher spontaneous ignition temperature. A gasoline engine generally operates by means of spark ignition, and is usually called as spark-ignition engine. Diesel fuel has a relatively lower spontaneous ignition temperature. In a diesel engine, diesel fuel is generally injected into the engine cylinder directly through a fuel injection pump and a fuel nozzle, and mixed with compressed air therein. The mixture is spontaneously ignited under high temperature and high pressure, thus driving piston into work. A diesel engine is usually called as compression-ignition engine.. Generally, compared with a gasoline engine, a diesel engine has a 30% higher thermal efficiency, 45% lower greenhouse gases emissions, and low emissions of CO and hydrocarbon. Therefore, in order to save energy and reduce fuel cost, it is significant to promote the use of diesel engines. A diesel engine has a higher thermal conversion efficiency than a gasoline engine, mainly because diesel engine has a larger compression ratio. Theoretically, larger the compression ratio, higher efficiency of the engine is. The compression ratio for a gasoline engine is generally 7-11, while that for a diesel engine is generally 14-22. In recent years, a diesel engine has already adopted some advanced technologies, such as turbocharging, intercooler, direct injection, catalytic conversion of exhaust gas and particle collection, etc. The emissions of vehicles with diesel engine have met the Euro III, Euro IV and even Euro V emission standards. The compression ratio of a diesel engine is restricted by the mechanical strength of engine materials, while that of a gasoline engine is restricted by the antiknock property of gasoline. With an excessive compression ratio, detonation phenomenon will appear during the combustion of air-fuel mixture. Regular gasoline types in the market include unleaded gasoline 90#, 93#, 95#, 97# and 98#. 2. Table 1 shows octane rating of a part of hydrocarbon compounds obtained from the Internet. Table 1: the relation between hydrocarbon structure and octane number n-heptane CH3-(CH2) 5-ch3 octane number 0 n-octane CH3-(CH2) 6-ch3 octane number -17 n-hexane ch3-(ch2) 4-ch3 octane number 25 Octene-1 CH2=CH-(CH2) 5-ch3 octane number 34.7 Pentane CH3-(CH2) 5-ch3 octane number 61 Ethylcyclohexane CH3-CH2-(cyclohexane) octane number 44 Dimethylcyclohexane CH3-( cyclohexane) -CH3 octane number 62 Cyclohexane octane number 77 Hexene-4 CH3-(CH2) 2-CH=CH-(CH2) 2-ch3 octane number 74.3 Hexene-1 CH2=CH-(CH2) 3-ch3 octane number 80 octane number 100 octane number 106 octane number 98 octane number 103 octane number 104 octane number 108 Regular gasoline contains xylene, ethylbenzene, toluene, methyl-ethyl benzene or other benzene derivatives, which are generally with a high octane rating and used as important chemical materials. After being extracted, the octane rating of gasoline will be sharply declined, and cannot meet the requirements on gasoline quality in the market. This causes the struggling for materials between chemical products and gasoline products. Aromatic hydrocarbons generally have mildly virulent. The concept of fuel containing no aromatic hydrocarbons is suggested in the world recently. 4. Antiknock additive To improve the octane rating of gasoline, gasoline supplier sometime adds gasoline antiknock additive. Regular gasoline antiknock additives mainly include alkyl lead, methyl cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (ΜΜΤ), methyl tert-butyl ether (ΜΤΒΕ), tert-amyl methyl ether, tert-butyl alcohol and ethanol, etc. Use of ΜΜΤ and ΜΤΒΕ often causes secondary contamination to the environment. ΜΤΒΕ is prohibited in some states in US by regulations. Isooctane Butene-1 Ethylbenzene Dimethylbenzene Methylbenzene Benzene (CH3)3C-CH2-CH(CH3)2 ch2=ch-ch2-ch3 C^c2H5 CH3-(C6H4) -ch3 c^CH3 c6h6 3. Aromatic hydrocarbons and octane rating Low carbon alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol and tert-butyl alcohol, or the mixtures thereof have a similar function as ΜΤΒΕ when used as gasoline additive. Moreover, they are advantageous in cost over ΜΤΒΕ, so that they have a high potential in the market as gasoline blender. Adding 10% propyl alcohol into gasoline can upgrade the blended gasoline (i.e., increase the octane rating of gasoline), thus creating a significant economic benefit. Multi-branched alkanes have a higher octane rating than its isomers straight-chain alkanes, and are of a good combustibility in cylinder, i.e., has a small knocking effect, when used as components of regular gasoline. Since straight-chain alkanes have a low octane rating, in oil refining industry they are converted into aromatics through catalytic reforming process, with which straight-chain alkanes are converted into highly branched alkanes as much as possible. 5. Gasoline, diesel and kerosene Generally, hydrocarbon compounds with a carbon chain length of 5-18 contained in oil are liquid at room temperature. For instance, hydrocarbons from C5H12 to C18H38 are all liquid at room temperature. However, hydrocarbons with a carbon chain length above 19 (Cl9) are solid at room temperature. Gasoline is generally hydrocarbon with a carbon chain length of 5-11; kerosene is generally hydrocarbon with a carbon chain length of 12-14 or 12-15; and diesel is generally hydrocarbon with a carbon chain length of 15-18 or 14-18. According to the market demand, real fractions of gasoline, diesel and kerosene can be appropriately extended to two carbon atoms in both directions. Not of all of the above-mentioned various materials originate from crude oil, and a small part thereof can be from coal or plant oil. The main difference among gasoline, diesel and kerosene is the carbon chain length. 6. Creativity of the present invention In previous, the main research work for gasoline concentrates on how to improve the octane rating of gasoline and its spontaneous ignition temperature, so as to meet the requirement of increasing the compression ratio of engine and improve the efficiency of engine. Instead, by lowering the octane rating of gasoline and its spontaneous ignition temperature, gasoline can be compressively ignited. In this case, the compression ratio of engine using this kind of gasoline with a low octane rating can be significantly improved, and thus the thermal conversion efficiency of engine can be significantly increased. Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps. The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides a new kind of clean, high efficient and environmentally friendly gasoline product. In one set of embodiments the gasoline product is a low rating gasoline with an octane rating lower than 50. However, it is actually a new kind of fuel oil for internal combustion engine, not regular oil in common sense. Thus, the gasoline product described herein is also referred to herein as a fuel oil product for internal combustion engine. One of its characteristics is that this new gasoline product with a low octane rating can be used in compression ignition. This compression ignition is a kind of diffusion compression ignition, which is different from the current condition that gasoline can be combusted in the gasoline engine smoothly only when it is ignited by the spark plug, and also different from the combustion control method of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI). That is, the internal combustion engine using this new kind of gasoline product can adopt the technologies of high compression ratio and high air-fuel ratio, but without electronic ignition system, such as a spark plug, which is necessary for current diesel engine. Another characteristic of the gasoline product is that, this new gasoline product has the same or similar fractions as current gasoline, which is different from diesel products for compression ignition. Although diesel products can be compressively ignited and diesel engine is provided with no electronic ignition system, the fractions of diesel are around C14-C18. However, the new gasoline product of this present invention has fractions similar with regular gasoline, around C6-C11. The new gasoline product with a low octane rating according to the present invention mainly consists of oil rectified hydrocarbon compounds of C6-C12, and a small amount of compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and compounds of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. As shown in Table 1, straight-chain alkanes have a low octane rating and are preferred components for gasoline with a low octane rating, while highly branched alkanes (isomerization alkanes) and aromatics have a high octane rating, and thus should be removed to be greatest extent in gasoline having a low octane rating. As a further development, the new gasoline product with a low octane rating according to the present invention can be extended to C5-C18 based on the hydrocarbon compounds with a carbon chain length of 6-11, as long as its mixture can meet two prerequisites, i.e., “can be used in compressively ignited” and “can be sufficiently combusted within the engine cylinder”. On the other hand, since the new gasoline product according to the present invention has a low octane rating and a low antiknock property, it cannot be directly used in regular gasoline engine. The new gasoline product with a low octane rating is advantageous in cleanness, efficiency and environmental friendliness. Specifically, (1) High efficient: Since the gasoline with a low octane rating can be used in compression ignition, the internal combustion engine using this gasoline can adopt a high compression ratio and a high air-fuel ratio, and the compression ratio thereof can be up to 14-22. Therefore, thermal efficiency of the internal combustion engine using the new gasoline product is higher than that of regular gasoline engine, and thus has an excellent fuel economy. (2) Clean: Since the new gasoline product with a low octane rating has a low octane rating e.g., 50, 40, 30 or even negative, the content of aromatics such as xylene, ethylbenzene, toluene, methyl-ethyl benzene and other benzene derivatives with a high octane rating is very low, or even zero. And there is no need to add antiknock additives such as ΜΤΒΕ or ΜΜΤ for increasing the octane rating of gasoline. (3) Environmentally friendly: Compared with straight-chain alkanes and highly branched alkanes, exhaust gas from the combustion of aromatics and antiknock additives, such as ΜΤΒΕ, contains tiny amount of nitrogen oxide or compound of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, which are harmful to the environment and people, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, to increase octane rating, current gasoline products have to be produced through a complex process comprising many steps, and consumption in both energy and material per unit of gasoline product is higher than the gasoline with a low octane rating. Therefore, the new gasoline product with a low octane rating according to the present invention becomes more environmentally friendly. The new gasoline product according to the present invention can be obtained from appropriately lowering the octane rating of straight-run gasoline in a scope of fractions for regular gasoline. This kind of new gasoline product has a low requirement on octane rating. Therefore, with respect to different seasons, the component of the gasoline having a low octane rating can be increased to C5 in the season with a low temperature, or increased to C12-C18 in the season with a high temperature. Gasoline having a low octane rating can be mixed with diesel oil in a ratio selected from a wide scope, in order to improve the performance of diesel oil. For example, to improve atomization performance and complete combustion performance of diesel oil, the mixing ratio can be e.g. 0-50% or 50-100%, and different blended fuel rating can be set according to different mixing ratio. This can improve the liquidity and freezing resistant of diesel oil. Octane rating can not only used as quality standard for the gasoline product having a low octane rating, but also as identification marker for different products, such as gasoline 40#, 30#, or 50#. A small amount of ethanol or dimethyl ether can be added into the gasoline having a low octane rating, so as to form blended fuel.
