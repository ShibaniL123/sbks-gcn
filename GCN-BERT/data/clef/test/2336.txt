An organic photoelectric device may be classified as follows in accordance with its driving principles. One type of organic photoelectric device is an electronic device driven as follows: excitons are generated in an organic material layer by photons from an external light source; the excitons are separated into electrons and holes; and the electrons and holes are transferred to different electrodes as a current source (voltage source). Another type of organic photoelectric device is an electronic device driven as follows: a voltage or a current is applied to at least two electrodes to inject holes and/or electrons into an organic material semiconductor positioned at an interface of the electrodes, and the device is driven by the injected electrons and holes. Examples of an organic photoelectric device may include an organic light emitting diode, an organic solar cell, an organic photo conductor drum, and an organic transistor. The organic photoelectric device may include a hole injecting or transport material, an electron injecting or transport material, or a light emitting material. For example, an organic light emitting diode (OLED) has recently drawn attention due to an increase in demand for flat panel displays.

Thus, electron transport capability of an organic photoelectric device may be enhanced, and excellent effects on efficiency and driving voltage may be achieved. Also, the compound may have excellent electrochemical and thermal stability and thus, may help improve life-span characteristic during the operation of the organic photoelectric device. In an implementation, the compound for an organic photoelectric device may be represented by the following Chemical Formula 1.

For example, at least one of X1 to X3 may be —N—, and at least one of X4 to X6 may be —N—. Each heteroaryl group may include various numbers of heteroatoms in various combinations. Each combination of the heteroatoms may vary characteristics of the compound. Thus, a particular combination may be selected to satisfy desired characteristics. In an implementation, the heteroatom may be N. However, it is not limited thereto. In an implementation, the compound represented by the above Chemical Formula 1 may be a compound represented by the following Chemical Formula 2. In Chemical Formula 2, Ar1 to Ar4, X1 to X6, Y1, Y2 and B1 may be the same as defined in Chemical Formula 1. For example, Ar1 to Ar4 may each independently be a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 aryl group or a substituted or unsubstituted C3 to C30 heteroaryl group. For example, Ar1 to Ar4 may each independently be selected from the group of a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted anthracenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted phenanthrenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted perylenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted chrysenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted pyridinyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted pyridazinyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted quinolinyl group, and a substituted or unsubstituted isoquinolinyl group.

Thus, the compound may help improve life-span characteristics of an organic photoelectric device. The substituents may vary electron transport capability of the compound, depending on the kind of the substituents. In addition, the compound may have a bulky and/or asymmetric structure and thus may have lower crystallinity. The compound having lower crystallinity may help improve efficiency characteristic and life-span of a device. B1 may be a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 aryl group or a substituted or unsubstituted C3 to C30 heteroaryl group. In an implementation, B1 may form a fused ring with an adjacent element, e.g., the moiety including Y1 and Y2.

For example, the substituent may work as a functional group for pulling the electrons and thus, may help adjust a transport rate of the electrons to be similar to that of holes. In addition, an aryl group as the substituent may help increase thermal stability. Accordingly, the substituent may be selected or modified depending on desired characteristics of a device.

Performance of Organic Photoelectric Device Measurement Each organic photoelectric device was measured regarding current density and luminance changes and luminous efficiency depending on voltage. Specifically, the measurement was performed as follows. 1) Current Density Change Depending on Voltage Change Each organic photoelectric device was measured regarding current value flowing in a unit device using a current-voltage meter (Keithley 2400) while its voltage was increased from 0 V to 14 V, and the current value was divided by an area. The results are provided in FIG. 6. 2) Luminance Change Depending on Voltage Change Each organic photoelectric device was measured regarding luminance using a luminance meter (Minolta Cs-1000A) while its voltage was increased from 0 V to 14 V.

The results are provided in FIGS. 8 and 9. Measurement Result The measurement results are provided in the following Table 1. TABLE 1 Luminance 500 cd/m2 Electric power Driving voltage Luminous efficiency efficiency (V) (cd/A) (lm/W) Example 5 4.4 5.80 4.14 Example 6 5.4 4.75 2.76 Example 7 6.4 3.84 1.88 Comparative 6.6 3.58 1.70 Example 1 Referring to Table 1, the organic light emitting diodes according to Examples 5 to 7 had excellent driving voltage, luminous efficiency, and electric power efficiency. Accordingly, the organic light emitting diodes had an increased device life-span. By way of summation and review, an organic light emitting diode may transform electrical energy into light by applying current to an organic light emitting material. It may have a structure in which a functional organic material layer is interposed between an anode and a cathode. The organic material layer may include a multi-layer including different materials, e.g., a hole injection layer (HIL), a hole transport layer (HTL), an emission layer, an electron transport layer (ETL), and/or an electron injection layer (EIL), in order to help improve efficiency and stability of an organic photoelectric device. In such an organic photoelectric device, when a voltage is applied between an anode and a cathode, holes from the anode and electrons from the cathode may be injected to an organic material layer and recombined to generate excitons having high energy. The generated excitons may generate light having certain wavelengths while shifting to a ground state. One type of organic light emitting diode may include a low molecular weight aromatic diamine and aluminum complex as an emission layer forming material. The organic layer may have a structure in which a thin film (hole transport layer (HTL)) of a diamine derivative and a thin film of tris(8-hydroxy-quinolate)aluminum (Alq3) are laminated. Recently, a phosphorescent light emitting material for a light emitting material of an organic light emitting diode has been considered, in addition to the fluorescent light emitting material. Such a phosphorescent material may emit light by transiting the electrons from a ground state to an exited state, non-radiance transiting of a singlet exciton to a triplet exciton through intersystem crossing, and transiting a triplet exciton to a ground state to emit light. As described above, in an organic light emitting diode, an organic material layer may include a light emitting material and a charge transport material, e.g., a hole injection material, a hole transport material, an electron transport material, an electron injection material, or the like. The light emitting material may be classified as blue, green, and red light emitting materials according to emitted colors, and yellow and orange light emitting materials to emit colors approaching natural colors. When one material is used as a light emitting material, a maximum light emitting wavelength may be shifted to a long wavelength or color purity may decrease because of interactions between molecules, or device efficiency may decrease because of a light emitting quenching effect. Therefore, a host/dopant system may be included as a light emitting material in order to improve color purity and increase luminous efficiency and stability through energy transfer. In order to achieve excellent performance of an organic photoelectric device, a material constituting an organic material layer, e.g., a hole injection material, a hole transport material, a light emitting material, an electron transport material, an electron injection material, and a light emitting material such as a host and/or a dopant, should be stable and have good efficiency. A low molecular weight organic light emitting diode may be manufactured as a thin film in a vacuum deposition method and may have good efficiency and life-span performance. A polymer organic light emitting diode may be manufactured in an Inkjet or spin coating method may have an advantage of low initial cost and being large-sized. Both low molecular weight organic light emitting and polymer organic light emitting diodes may have an advantage of being self-light emitting and having high speed response, wide viewing angle, ultra-thin, high image quality, durability, large driving temperature range, and the like. For example, they may have good visibility due to self-light emitting characteristics, compared with a conventional LCD (liquid crystal display) and may have an advantage of decreasing thickness and weight up to a third, compared with an LCD, because they do not need a backlight. In addition, since they have a response speed up to 1,000 times faster than LCD, they can realize a perfect motion picture without after-image. Based on these advantages, they have been developed to have 80 times efficiency and more than 100 times life-span. Recently, sizes have rapidly increased, and a 40-inch organic light emitting diode panel has been developed. The display devices should have improved luminous efficiency and life-span in order to be larger. Herein, luminous efficiency should have a smooth combination between holes and electrons in an emission layer. However, an organic material in general may have slower electron mobility than hole mobility, and may exhibit an inefficient combination between holes and electrons. Accordingly, increasing electron injection and mobility from a cathode and simultaneously preventing movement of holes may be desirable. In order to improve life-span, a material crystallization caused by Joule heating generated during device operating may be prevented. Accordingly, an organic compound having excellent electron injection and mobility, and high electrochemical stability may be desirable. The embodiments provide a compound for an organic photoelectric device that may act as a light emitter, or electron injection and/or transport material, and may also act as a light emitting host along with an appropriate dopant. The embodiments provide an organic photoelectric device having excellent life-span, efficiency, driving voltage, electrochemical stability, and thermal stability using the compound. When the compound is particularly used to form an electron transport layer (ETL) for the organic photoelectric device, the organic photoelectric device may have excellent performance efficiency characteristic. The compound for an organic photoelectric device may have excellent electrochemical and thermal stability and life-span characteristics, and thus may provide an organic photoelectric device having high luminous efficiency at a low driving voltage. The embodiments provide an organic photoelectric device having excellent life-span, efficiency, electrochemical stability, and thermal stability.
