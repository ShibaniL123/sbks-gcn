Preparation Example 2: Preparation of tert-butyl 6-hydroxyl-2-azaspiro [3.3] heptane-2-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 6-oxo-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptane-2-carboxylate (4.22 g, 20 mmol) was added in methanol (30 mL), cooled under nitrogen gas protection to 0°C, and sodium borohydride (1.52 g, 40 mmol) was added. After addition, the reaction solution was heated to 25°C and stirred for 1 h, after completing reaction as measured by LC-MS, water (1 mL) was added to quench reaction, solvent was removed by vacuum distillation, water (100 mL) and ethyl acetate (100 mL) were added, the phases were separated, the organic phase was washed with hydrochloric acid (1 mol/L, 50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, the filtrate was concentrated to obtain the title compound in white color (4.0 g, yield 93.7 %).
