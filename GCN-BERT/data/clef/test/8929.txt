The information in the electronic format of the sequence listing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION Provided herein are 5′ modified nucleosides and oligomeric compounds prepared therefrom. More particularly, 5′ modified nucleoside are provided that are useful for incorporation at one of the terminal positions of an oligomeric compound, preferably the 5′ position. In certain embodiments, the oligomeric compounds provided herein are expected to have enhanced nuclease stability. In certain embodiments, the oligomeric compounds and compositions provided herein that incorporate one or more of these modified nucleosides are expected to hybridize to a portion of a target RNA resulting in loss of normal function of the target RNA. The oligomeric compounds are also expected to be useful as primers and probes in diagnostic applications. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Targeting disease-causing gene sequences was first suggested more than thirty years ago (Belikova et al., Tet. Lett., 1967, 37, 3557-3562), and antisense activity was demonstrated in cell culture more than a decade later (Zamecnik et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1978, 75, 280-284). One advantage of antisense technology in the treatment of a disease or condition that stems from a disease-causing gene is that it is a direct genetic approach that has the ability to modulate (increase or decrease) the expression of specific disease-causing genes. Another advantage is that validation of a therapeutic target using antisense compounds results in direct and immediate discovery of the drug candidate; the antisense compound is the potential therapeutic agent. Generally, the principle behind antisense technology is that an antisense compound hybridizes to a target nucleic acid and modulates gene expression activities or function, such as transcription or translation. The modulation of gene expression can be achieved by, for example, target degradation or occupancy-based inhibition. An example of modulation of RNA target function by degradation is RNase H-based degradation of the target RNA upon hybridization with a DNA-like antisense compound. Another example of modulation of gene expression by target degradation is RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi generally refers to antisense-mediated gene silencing involving the introduction of dsRNA leading to the sequence-specific reduction of targeted endogenous mRNA levels. An additional example of modulation of RNA target function by an occupancy-based mechanism is modulation of microRNA function. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of protein-coding RNAs. The binding of an antisense compound to a microRNA prevents that microRNA from binding to its messenger RNA targets, and thus interferes with the function of the microRNA. Regardless of the specific mechanism, this sequence-specificity makes antisense compounds extremely attractive as tools for target validation and gene functionalization, as well as therapeutics to selectively modulate the expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of malignancies and other diseases. Antisense technology is an effective means for reducing the expression of one or more specific gene products and can therefore prove to be uniquely useful in a number of therapeutic, diagnostic, and research applications. Chemically modified nucleosides are routinely used for incorporation into antisense compounds to enhance one or more properties, such as nuclease resistance, pharmacokinetics or affinity for a target RNA. In 1998, the antisense compound, Vitravene® (fomivirsen; developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.) was the first antisense drug to achieve marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is currently a treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced retinitis in AIDS patients. New chemical modifications have improved the potency and efficacy of antisense compounds, uncovering the potential for oral delivery as well as enhancing subcutaneous administration, decreasing potential for side effects, and leading to improvements in patient convenience. Chemical modifications increasing potency of antisense compounds allow administration of lower doses, which reduces the potential for toxicity, as well as decreasing overall cost of therapy. Modifications increasing the resistance to degradation result in slower clearance from the body, allowing for less frequent dosing. Different types of chemical modifications can be combined in one compound to further optimize the compound's efficacy. The synthesis of 5′-substituted DNA and RNA derivatives and their incorporation into oligomeric compounds has been reported in the literature (Saha et al., J. Org. Chem., 1995, 60, 788-789; Wang et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 1999, 9, 885-890; and Mikhailov et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1991, 10(1-3), 339-343; Leonid et al., 1995, 14(3-5), 901-905; and Eppacher et al., Helvetica Chimica Acta, 2004, 87, 3004-3020). The 5′-substituted monomers have also been made as the monophosphate with modified bases (Wang et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides & Nucleic Acids, 2004, 23 (1 & 2), 317-337). A genus of modified nucleosides including optional modification at a plurality of positions including the 5′-position and the 2′-position of the sugar ring and oligomeric compounds incorporating these modified nucleosides therein has been reported (see International Application Number: PCT/US94/02993, Published on Oct. 13, 1994 as WO 94/22890). The synthesis of 5′-CH2 substituted 2′-O-protected nucleosides and their incorporation into oligomers has been previously reported (see Wu et al., Helvetica Chimica Acta, 2000, 83, 1127-1143 and Wu et al. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999, 10, 921-924). Amide linked nucleoside dimers have been prepared for incorporation into oligonucleotides wherein the 3′ linked nucleoside in the dimer (5′ to 3′) comprises a 2′-OCH3 and a 5′-(S)—CH3 (Mesmaeker et al., Synlett, 1997, 1287-1290). A genus of 2′-substituted 5′-CH2 (or O) modified nucleosides and a discussion of incorporating them into oligonucleotides has been previously reported (see International Application Number: PCT/US92/01020, published on Feb. 7, 1992 as WO 92/13869). The preparation of 5′ methylenephosphonate DNA and RNA monomers, dimers, oligomers comprising these dimers and Tm evaluations of these oligomers have been reported (see Böhringer et al., Tet. Lett., 1993, 34, 2723-2726; Collingwood et al., Synlett, 1995, 7, 703-705; and Huffer et al., Helvetica Chimica Acta, 2002, 85, 2777-2806). The synthesis of modified 5′-phosphonate monomers having 2′-substitution and their use to make modified antiviral dimers has been previously reported (see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/418,662, published on Apr. 6, 2006 as US 2006/0074035). Other modified 5′-phosphonate monomers and their use to make dimeric compounds for oligonucleotide synthesis have also been described (see published International Application WO 97/35869). A genus of 5′-modified methylenephosphonate monomers and their use to make dimeric compounds for oligonucleotide synthesis have been described. Their Tm evaluations and biological activities have also been reported (see published EP Applications 614907 and 629633). Various analogs of 5′ or 6′-phosphonate ribonucleosides comprising a hydroxyl group at the 5′ and or 6′ position have been prepared and reported in the literature (see Chen et al., Phosphorus, Sulfur and Silicon, 2002, 177, 1783-1786; Jung et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2000, 8, 2501-2509, Gallier et al., Eur. J. Org. Chem., 2007, 925-933 and Hampton et al., J. Med. Chem., 1976, 19(8), 1029-1033). The synthesis of 5′-phosphonate deoxyribonucleoside monomers and dimers having a 5′-phosphate group and their incorporation into oligomeric compounds have been described. Their physico-chemical properties including thermal stability as well as substrate activity toward certain nucleases have also been discussed (see Nawrot et al., Oligonucleotides, 2006, 16(1), 68-82).

As used herein, “complementary” in reference to linked nucleosides, oligonucleotides; or nucleic acids, refers to the capacity of an oligomeric compound to hybridize to another oligomeric compound or nucleic acid through nucleobase complementarity. In certain embodiments, an antisense compound and its target are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of corresponding positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleobases that can bond with each other to allow stable association between the antisense compound and the target. One skilled in the art recognizes that the inclusion of mismatches is possible without eliminating the ability of the oligomeric compounds to remain in association. Therefore, described herein are antisense compounds that may comprise up to about 20% nucleotides that are mismatched (i.e., are not nucleobase complementary to the corresponding nucleotides of the target). Preferably the antisense compounds contain no more than about 15%, more preferably not more than about 10%, most preferably not more than 5% or no mismatches. The remaining nucleotides are nucleobase complementary or otherwise do not disrupt hybridization (e.g., universal bases). One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize the compounds provided herein are at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or 100% complementary to a target nucleic acid. As used herein, “hybridization” refers to the pairing of complementary oligomeric compounds (e.g., an antisense compound and its target nucleic acid). While not limited to a particular mechanism, the most common mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleobases). For example, the natural base adenine is nucleobase complementary to the natural nucleobases thymidine and uracil which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. The natural base guanine is nucleobase complementary to the natural bases cytosine and 5-methyl cytosine. Hybridization can occur under varying circumstances. As used herein, “specifically hybridizes” refers to the ability of an oligomeric compound to hybridize to one nucleic acid site with greater affinity than it hybridizes to another nucleic acid site. In certain embodiments, an antisense oligonucleotide specifically hybridizes to more than one target site. As used herein, “modulation” refers to a perturbation of amount or quality of a function or activity when compared to the function or activity prior to modulation. For example, modulation includes the change, either an increase (stimulation or induction) or a decrease (inhibition or reduction) in gene expression. As a further example, modulation of expression can include perturbing splice site selection of pre-mRNA processing, resulting in a change in the amount of a particular splice-variant present compared to conditions that were not perturbed. As a further example, modulation includes perturbing translation of a protein. As used herein, “motif” refers to a pattern of modifications in an oligomeric compound or a region thereof. Motifs may be defined by modifications at certain nucleosides and/or at certain linking groups of an oligomeric compound. As used herein, “nucleoside motif” refers to a pattern of nucleoside modifications in an oligomeric compound or a region thereof. The linkages of such an oligomeric compound may be modified or unmodified. Unless otherwise indicated; motifs herein describing only nucleosides are intended to be nucleoside motifs. Thus, in such instances, the linkages are not limited. As used herein, “linkage motif” refers to a pattern of linkage modifications in an oligomeric compound or region thereof. The nucleosides of such an oligomeric compound may be modified or unmodified. Unless otherwise indicated, motifs herein describing only linkages are intended to be linkage motifs. Thus, in such instances, the nucleosides are not limited. As used herein, “different modifications” or “differently modified” refer to modifications relative to naturally occurring molecules that are different from one another, including absence of modifications. Thus, for example, a MOE nucleoside and an unmodified DNA nucleoside are “differently modified,” even though the DNA nucleoside is unmodified. Likewise, DNA and RNA are “differently modified,” even though both are naturally-occurring unmodified nucleosides. Nucleosides that are the same but for comprising different nucleobases are not differently modified, unless otherwise indicated. For example, a nucleoside comprising a 2′-OMe modified sugar and an adenine nucleobase and a nucleoside comprising a 2′-OMe modified sugar and a thymine nucleobase are not differently modified. As used herein, “the same modifications” refer to modifications relative to naturally occurring molecules that are the same as one another, including absence of modifications. Thus, for example, two unmodified DNA nucleoside have “the same modification,” even though the DNA nucleoside is unmodified. As used herein, “type of modification” in reference to a nucleoside or a nucleoside of a “type” refers to the modification of a nucleoside and includes modified and unmodified nucleosides. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, a “nucleoside having a modification of a first type” may be an unmodified nucleoside. As used herein, “separate regions” refers to a portion of an oligomeric compound wherein the nucleosides and internucleoside linkages within the region all comprise the same modifications; and the nucleosides and/or the internucleoside linkages of any neighboring portions include at least one different modification. As used herein, “alternating motif” refers to an oligomeric compound or a portion thereof, having at least four separate regions of modified nucleosides in a pattern (AB)nAm where A represents a region of nucleosides having a first type of modification; B represent a region of nucleosides having a different type of modification; n is 2-15; and m is 0 or 1. Thus, in certain embodiments, alternating motifs include 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 or more alternating regions. In certain embodiments, each A region and each B region independently comprises 1-4 nucleosides. As used herein, “fully modified” refers to an oligomeric compound or portion thereon wherein each nucleoside is a modified nucleoside. The modifications of the nucleosides of a fully modified oligomeric compound may all be the same or one or more may be different from one another. As used herein, “uniform modified” or “uniformly modified” refer to oligomeric compounds or portions thereof that comprise the same modifications. The nucleosides of a region of uniformly modified nucleosides all comprise the same modification. As used herein the term “gapmer” or “gapped oligomeric compound” refers to an oligomeric compound having two external regions or wings and an internal region or gap. The three regions form a contiguous sequence of monomer subunits with the sugar groups of the external regions being different than the sugar groups of the internal region and wherein the sugar group of each monomer subunit within a particular region is essentially the same. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent” refers to any substance suitable for use in administering to an animal. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent is sterile saline. In certain embodiments, such sterile saline is pharmaceutical grade saline. The terms “substituent” and “substituent group,” as used herein, are meant to include groups that are typically added to other groups or parent compounds to enhance desired properties or provide other desired effects. Substituent groups can be protected or unprotected and can be added to one available site or to many available sites in a parent compound.

A preferred list of further substituent groups includes H, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aliphatic, alkoxy, acyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl, alicyclic, heterocyclic and heteroarylalkyl. Selected substituents within the compounds described herein are present to a recursive degree. In this context, “recursive substituent” means that a substituent may recite another instance of itself. Because of the recursive nature of such substituents, theoretically, a large number may be present in any given claim. One of ordinary skill in the art of medicinal chemistry and organic chemistry understands that the total number of such substituents is reasonably limited by the desired properties of the compound intended. Such properties include, by way of example and not limitation, physical properties such as molecular weight, solubility or log P, application properties such as activity against the intended target and practical properties such as ease of synthesis. Recursive substituents are an intended aspect of the invention. One of ordinary skill in the art of medicinal and organic chemistry understands the versatility of such substituents. To the degree that recursive substituents are present in a claim of the invention, the total number will be determined as set forth above.

Linking groups or bifunctional linking moieties such as those known in the art are useful for attachment of chemical functional groups, conjugate groups, reporter groups and other groups to selective sites in a parent compound such as for example an oligomeric compound. In general, a bifunctional linking moiety comprises a hydrocarbyl moiety having two functional groups. One of the functional groups is selected to bind to a parent molecule or compound of interest and the other is selected to bind to essentially any selected group such as a chemical functional group or a conjugate group. In some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain structure or a polymer of repeating units such as ethylene glycols or amino acid units. Examples of functional groups that are routinely used in bifunctional linking moieties include without limitation, electrophiles for reacting with nucleophilic groups and nucleophiles for reacting with electrophilic groups.

In another aspect, the terminal phosphate is modified such that one or more of the O and OH groups are replaced with H, O, S, N(R) or alkyl where R is H, an amino protecting group or unsubstituted or substituted alkyl. In certain embodiments, the 5′ and or 3′ terminal group can comprise from 1 to 3 phosphate moieties that are each, independently, unmodified (di or tri-phosphates) or modified. In certain embodiments, the phosphate moiety is protected such as for example: —O—P(═O)(OPg)OPg, wherein each Pg is a protecting group. As used herein, the term “phosphorus moiety” refers to a group having the formula: wherein: Ra and Rc are each, independently, OH, SH, C1-C6 alkyl, substituted C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, substituted C1-C6 alkoxy, amino or substituted amino; and Rc is O or S. In certain embodiments the phosphorus moiety is protected with an appropriate protecting group.

The term “protecting group,” as used herein, refers to a labile chemical moiety which is known in the art to protect reactive groups including without limitation, hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups, against undesired reactions during synthetic procedures. Protecting groups are typically used selectively and/or orthogonally to protect sites during reactions at other reactive sites and can then be removed to leave the unprotected group as is or available for further reactions. Protecting groups as known in the art are described generally in Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2007. Groups can be selectively incorporated into oligomeric compounds as provided herein as precursors. For example an amino group can be placed into a compound as provided herein as an azido group that can be chemically converted to the amino group at a desired point in the synthesis. Generally, groups are protected or present as precursors that will be inert to reactions that modify other areas of the parent molecule for conversion into their final groups at an appropriate time. Further representative protecting or precursor groups are discussed in Agrawal et al., Protocols for Oligonucleotide Conjugates, Humana Press; New Jersey, 1994, 26, 1-72. The term “orthogonally protected” refers to functional groups which are protected with different classes of protecting groups, wherein each class of protecting group can be removed in any order and in the presence of all other classes (see, Barany et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1977, 99, 7363-7365; Barany et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1980, 102, 3084-3095). Orthogonal protection is widely used in for example automated oligonucleotide synthesis. A functional group is deblocked in the presence of one or more other protected functional groups which is not affected by the deblocking procedure. This deblocked functional group is reacted in some manner and at some point a further orthogonal protecting group is removed under a different set of reaction conditions. This allows for selective chemistry to arrive at a desired compound or oligomeric compound.

See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,725,677 and Re. 34,069 (β-cyanoethyl); Beaucage et al., Tetrahedron, 1993, 49(10), 1925-1963; Beaucage et al., Tetrahedron, 1993, 49(46), 10441-10488; Beaucage et al., Tetrahedron, 1992, 48(12), 2223-2311. In certain embodiments, compounds having reactive phosphorus groups are provided that are useful for forming internucleoside linkages including for example phosphodiester and phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. Such reactive phosphorus groups are known in the art and contain phosphorus atoms in PIII or PV valence state including, but not limited to, phosphoramidite, H-phosphonate, phosphate triesters and phosphorus containing chiral auxiliaries. In certain embodiments, reactive phosphorus groups are selected from diisopropylcyanoethoxy phosphoramidite (—O*—P[N[(CH(CH3)2]2]O(CH2)2CN) and H-phosphonate (—O*—P(═O)(H)OH), wherein the O* is provided from the Markush group for the monomer. A preferred synthetic solid phase synthesis utilizes phosphoramidites (PIII chemistry) as reactive phosphites.

Certain Internucleoside Linkages In certain embodiments, the present invention provides oligomeric compounds comprising linked nucleosides. In such embodiments, nucleosides may be linked together using any internucleoside linkage. The two main classes of internucleoside linking groups are defined by the presence or absence of a phosphorus atom. Representative phosphorus containing internucleoside linkages include, but are not limited to, phosphodiesters (P═O), phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, phosphoramidate, and phosphorothioates (P═S).

Oligonucleotides having non-phosphorus internucleoside linking groups may be referred to as oligonucleosides. Modified linkages, compared to natural phosphodiester linkages, can be used to alter, typically increase, nuclease resistance of the oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments, internucleoside linkages having a chiral atom can be prepared a racemic mixture, as separate enantomers. Representative chiral linkages include, but are not limited to, alkylphosphonates and phosphorothioates. Methods of preparation of phosphorous-containing and non-phosphorous-containing internucleoside linkages are well known to those skilled in the art. The oligonucleotides described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric configurations that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R) or (S), □ or □ such as for sugar anomers, or as (D) or (L) such as for amino acids et al. Included in the antisense compounds provided herein are all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. As used herein the phrase “neutral internucleoside linkage” is intended to include internucleoside linkages that are non-ionic. Neutral internucleoside linkages include without limitation, phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, Milvil (3′-CH2—N(CH3)—O-5′), amide-3 (3′-CH2—C(═O)—N(H)-5′), amide-4 (3′-CH2—N(H)—C(═O)-5′), formacetal (3′-O—CH2—O-5′), and thioformacetal (3′-S—CH2—O-5′).

In embodiments where the number of nucleosides of an oligomeric compound or oligonucleotide is limited, whether to a range or to a specific number, the oligomeric compound or oligonucleotide may, nonetheless further comprise additional other substituents. For example, an oligonucleotide comprising 8-30 nucleosides excludes oligonucleotides having 31 nucleosides, but, unless otherwise indicated, such an oligonucleotide may further comprise, for example one or more conjugates, terminal groups, or other substituents. In certain embodiments, terminal groups include, but are not limited to, terminal group nucleosides. In such embodiments, the terminal group nucleosides are differently modified than the terminal nucleoside of the oligonucleotide, thus distinguishing such terminal group nucleosides from the nucleosides of the oligonucleotide. Certain Motifs In certain embodiments, the present invention provides oligomeric compounds comprising one or more regions having a particular nucleoside motif. In certain embodiments, the 5′-terminal nucleoside of a modified oligonucleotide of the present invention comprises a compound of Formula IIb or IIc. Gapped Motifs In certain embodiments, the oligomeric compounds of the present invention comprise a gapmer region. In certain such embodiments, the sugar groups of the external regions are the same as one another (referred to herein as a symmetric gapmer). In certain embodiments, the sugar group used in the 5′-external region is different from the sugar group used in the 3′-external region (referred to herein as an asymmetric gapmer). In certain embodiments, the external regions are small (each independently 1, 2, 3, 4 or about 5 monomer subunits) and the monomer subunits comprise non-naturally occurring sugar groups with the internal region comprising β-D-2′-deoxyribonucleosides. In certain embodiments, the external regions each, independently, comprise from 1 to about 5 monomer subunits having non-naturally occurring sugar groups and the internal region comprises from 6 to 18 unmodified nucleosides. The internal region or the gap generally comprises β-D-2′-deoxyribonucleosides but can comprise non-naturally occurring sugar groups. The heterocyclic base and internucleoside linkage is independently variable at each position of a gapped oligomeric compound. The motif further optionally includes the use of one or more other groups including but not limited to capping groups, conjugate groups and other 5′ or 3′-terminal groups. In certain embodiments, the gapped oligomeric compounds comprise an internal region of β-D-2′-deoxyribonucleosides with one of the external regions comprising modified nucleosides. In certain embodiments, the gapped oligomeric compounds comprise an internal region of β-D-2′-deoxyribonucleosides with both of the external regions comprising modified nucleosides. In certain embodiments, gapped oligomeric compounds are provided herein wherein all of the monomer subunits comprise non-naturally occurring sugar groups. In certain embodiments, gapped oligomeric compounds are provided comprising one or two modified nucleosides at the 5′-end, two or three modified nucleosides at the 3′-end and an internal region of from 10 to 16 β-D-2′-deoxyribonucleosides. In certain embodiments, gapped oligomeric compounds are provided comprising one modified nucleoside at the 5′-end, two modified nucleosides at the 3′-end and an internal region of from 10 to 16 β-D-2′-deoxyribonucleosides.

In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise one or more regions of alternating nucleoside and linkage modifications. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides of the present invention comprise one or more regions of alternating 2′-F modified nucleosides and 2′-OMe modified nucleosides. In certain such embodiments, such regions of alternating 2′F modified and 2′OMe modified nucleosides also comprise alternating linkages. In certain such embodiments, the linkages at the 3′ end of the 2′-F modified nucleosides are phosphorothioate linkages. In certain such embodiments, the linkages at the 3′ end of the 2′OMe nucleosides are phosphodiester linkages. In certain embodiments, such alternating regions are: [in-line-formulae](2′-F)—(PS)-(2′-OMe)-(PO)[/in-line-formulae] In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds comprise 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 such alternating regions. Such regions may be contiguous or may be interrupted by differently modified nucleosides or linkages. In certain embodiments, one or more alternating regions in an alternating motif include more than a single nucleoside of a type. For example, oligomeric compounds of the present invention may include one or more regions of any of the following nucleoside motifs: AABBAA; ABBABB; AABAAB; ABBABAABB; ABABAA; AABABAB; ABABAA; ABBAABBABABAA; BABBAABBABABAA; or ABABBAABBABABAA; wherein A is a nucleoside of a first type and B is a nucleoside of a second type. In certain embodiments, A and B are each selected from 2′-F, 2′-OMe, BNA, DNA, and MOE. In certain embodiments, A is DNA. In certain embodiments, B is 4′-CH2O-2′-BNA. In certain embodiments, A is DNA and B is 4′-CH2O-2′-BNA. In certain embodiments A is 4′-CH2O-2′-BNA. In certain embodiments, B is DNA. In certain embodiments A is 4′-CH2O-2′-BNA and B is DNA.

In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds having such an alternating motif also comprise a 5′ terminal nucleoside of Formula IIb or IIc. Two-Two-Three Motifs In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides of the present invention comprise a region having a 2-2-3 motif. Such regions comprises the following motif: [in-line-formulae]5′-(Formula IIb or IIc)-(E)w-(A)2-(B)x-(A)2-(C)y-(A)3-(D)z [/in-line-formulae] wherein: A is a first type of modified nucleoside; B, C, D, and E are nucleosides that are differently modified than A, however, B, C, D, and E may have the same or different modifications as one another; w and z are from 0 to 15; x and y are from 1 to 15. In certain embodiments, A is a 2′-OMe modified nucleoside. In certain embodiments, B, C, D, and E are all 2′-F modified nucleosides. In certain embodiments, A is a 2′-OMe modified nucleoside and B, C, D, and E are all 2′-F modified nucleosides. In certain embodiments, the linkages of a 2-2-3 motif are all modified linkages. In certain embodiments, the linkages are all phosphorothioate linkages. In certain embodiments, the linkages at the 3′-end of each modification of the first type are phosphodiester. In certain embodiments, Z is 0. In such embodiments, the region of three nucleosides of the first type are at the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, such region is at the 3′-end of the oligomeric compound, with no additional groups attached to the 3′ end of the region of three nucleosides of the first type. In certain embodiments, an oligomeric compound comprising an oligonucleotide where Z is 0, may comprise a terminal group attached to the 3′-terminal nucleoside. Such terminal groups may include additional nucleosides. Such additional nucleosides are typically non-hybridizing nucleosides. In certain embodiments, Z is 1-3. In certain embodiments, Z is 2. In certain embodiments, the nucleosides of Z are 2′-MOE nucleosides. In certain embodiments, Z represents non-hybridizing nucleosides. To avoid confusion, it is noted that such non-hybridizing nucleosides might also be described as a 3′-terminal group with Z=0. Combinations of Motifs It is to be understood, that certain of the above described motifs and modifications may be combined. Since a motif may comprises only a few nucleosides, a particular oligonucleotide may comprise two or more motifs. By way of non-limiting example, in certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds may have nucleoside motifs as described in the table below. In the table below, the term “None” indicates that a particular feature is not present in the oligonucleotide. For example, “None” in the column labeled “5′ motif/modification” indicates that the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide comprises the first nucleoside of the central motif. 5′ motif/modification Central Motif 3′-motif Compound of Formula IIb or IIc Alternating 2 MOE nucleosides Compound of Formula IIb or IIc 2-2-3 motif 2 MOE nucleosides Compound of Formula IIb or IIc Uniform 2 MOE nucleosides Compound of Formula IIb or IIc Alternating 2 MOE nucleosides Compound of Formula IIb or IIc Alternating 2 MOE A's Compound of Formula IIb or IIc 2-2-3 motif 2 MOE A's Compound of Formula IIb or IIc Uniform 2 MOE A's Compound of Formula IIb or IIc Alternating 2 MOE U's Compound of Formula IIb or IIc 2-2-3 motif 2 MOE U's Compound of Formula IIb or IIc Uniform 2 MOE U's Compound of Formula IIb or IIc Alternating 2 MOE nucleosides Compound of Formula IIb or IIc 2-2-3 motif 2 MOE nucleosides Compound of Formula IIb or IIc Uniform 2 MOE nucleosides Oligomeric compounds having any of the various nucleoside motifs described herein, may have any linkage motif. For example, the oligomeric compounds, including but not limited to those described in the above table, may have a linkage motif selected from non-limiting the table below: 5′ most linkage Central region 3′-region PS Alternating PO/PS 6 PS PS Alternating PO/PS 7 PS PS Alternating PO/PS 8 PS As is apparent from the above, non-limiting tables, the lengths of the regions defined by a nucleoside motif and that of a linkage motif need not be the same. For example, the 3′ region in the nucleoside motif table above is 2 nucleosides, while the 3′-region of the linkage motif table above is 6-8 nucleosides. Combining the tables results in an oligonucleotide having two 3′-terminal MOE nucleosides and six to eight 3′-terminal phosphorothioate linkages (so some of the linkages in the central region of the nucleoside motif are phosphorothioate as well). To further illustrate, and not to limit in any way, nucleoside motifs and sequence motifs are combined to show five non-limiting examples in the table below. The first column of the table lists nucleosides and linkages by position from N1 (the first nucleoside at the 5′-end) to N20 (the 20th position from the 5′-end). In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides of the present invention are longer than 20 nucleosides (the table is merely exemplary). Certain positions in the table recite the nucleoside or linkage “none” indicating that the oligonucleotide has no nucleoside at that position.

The above examples are provided solely to illustrate how the described motifs may be used in combination and are not intended to limit the invention to the particular combinations or the particular modifications used in illustrating the combinations. Further, specific examples herein, including, but not limited to those in the above table are intended to encompass more generic embodiments. For example, column A in the above table exemplifies a region of alternating 2′-OMe and 2′-F nucleosides. Thus, that same disclosure also exemplifies a region of alternating different 2′-modifications. It also exemplifies a region of alternating 2′-O-alkyl and 2′-halogen nucleosides. It also exemplifies a region of alternating differently modified nucleosides. All of the examples throughout this specification contemplate such generic interpretation. It is also noted that the lengths of oligomeric compounds, such as those exemplified in the above tables, can be easily manipulated by lengthening or shortening one or more of the described regions, without disrupting the motif. In certain embodiments, the invention provides oligomeric compounds wherein the 5′-terminal nucleoside (position 1) is a compound of Formula IIb or IIc and the position 2 nucleoside comprises a 2% modification.

In certain embodiments, conjugate groups are directly attached to oligonucleotides in oligomeric compounds. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups are attached to oligonucleotides by a conjugate linking group. In certain such embodiments, conjugate linking groups, including, but not limited to, bifunctional linking moieties such as those known in the art are amenable to the compounds provided herein. Conjugate linking groups are useful for attachment of conjugate groups, such as chemical stabilizing groups, functional groups, reporter groups and other groups to selective sites in a parent compound such as for example an oligomeric compound. In general a bifunctional linking moiety comprises a hydrocarbyl moiety having two functional groups. One of the functional groups is selected to bind to a parent molecule or compound of interest and the other is selected to bind essentially any selected group such as chemical functional group or a conjugate group. In some embodiments, the conjugate linker comprises a chain structure or an oligomer of repeating units such as ethylene glycol or amino acid units. Examples of functional groups that are routinely used in a bifunctional linking moiety include, but are not limited to, electrophiles for reacting with nucleophilic groups and nucleophiles for reacting with electrophilic groups. In some embodiments, bifunctional linking moieties include amino, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, thiol, unsaturations (e.g., double or triple bonds), and the like. Some nonlimiting examples of conjugate linking moieties include pyrrolidine, 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (ADO), succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) and 6-aminohexanoic acid (AHEX or AHA). Other linking groups include, but are not limited to, substituted C1-C10 alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C2-C10 alkenyl or substituted or unsubstituted C2-C10 alkynyl, wherein a nonlimiting list of preferred substituent groups includes hydroxyl, amino, alkoxy, carboxy, benzyl, phenyl, nitro, thiol, thioalkoxy, halogen, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl and alkynyl. Conjugate groups may be attached to either or both ends of an oligonucleotide (terminal conjugate groups) and/or at any internal position. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups are at the 3′-end of an oligonucleotide of an oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups are near the 3′-end. In certain embodiments, conjugates are attached at the 3′ end of an oligomeric compound, but before one or more terminal group nucleosides. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups are placed within a terminal group. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides oligomeric compounds. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds comprise an oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, an oligomeric compound comprises an oligonucleotide and one or more conjugate and/or terminal groups. Such conjugate and/or terminal groups may be added to oligonucleotides having any of the chemical motifs discussed above. Thus, for example, an oligomeric compound comprising an oligonucleotide having region of alternating nucleosides may comprise a terminal group. Antisense Compounds In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention are antisense compounds. In such embodiments, the oligomeric compound is complementary to a target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, a target nucleic acid is an RNA. In certain embodiments, a target nucleic acid is a non-coding RNA. In certain embodiments, a target nucleic acid encodes a protein. In certain embodiments, a target nucleic acid is selected from a mRNA, a pre-mRNA, a microRNA, a non-coding RNA, including small non-coding RNA, and a promoter-directed RNA. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds are at least partially complementary to more than one target nucleic acid. For example, oligomeric compounds of the present invention may be microRNA mimics, which typically bind to multiple targets. Antisense mechanisms include any mechanism involving the hybridization of an oligomeric compound with target nucleic acid, wherein the hybridization results in a biological effect. In certain embodiments, such hybridization results in either target nucleic acid degradation or occupancy with concomitant inhibition or stimulation of the cellular machinery involving, for example, translation, transcription, or splicing of the target nucleic acid. One type of antisense mechanism involving degradation of target RNA is RNase H mediated antisense. RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. It is known in the art that single-stranded antisense compounds which are “DNA-like” elicit RNase H activity in mammalian cells. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of DNA-like oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of gene expression. Antisense mechanisms also include, without limitation RNAi mechanisms, which utilize the RISC pathway. Such RNAi mechanisms include, without limitation siRNA, ssRNA and microRNA mechanisms. Such mechanism include creation of a microRNA mimic and/or an anti-microRNA. Antisense mechanisms also include, without limitation, mechanisms that hybridize or mimic non-coding RNA other than microRNA or mRNA. Such non-coding RNA includes, but is not limited to promoter-directed RNA and short and long RNA that effects transcription or translation of one or more nucleic acids. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds specifically hybridize when there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the antisense compound to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and under conditions in which assays are performed in the case of in vitro assays. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention are RNAi compounds. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention are ssRNA compounds. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention are paired with a second oligomeric compound to form an siRNA. In certain such embodiments, the second oligomeric compound is also an oligomeric compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments, the second oligomeric compound is any modified or unmodified nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the oligomeric compound of the present invention is the antisense strand in an siRNA compound. In certain embodiments, the oligomeric compound of the present invention is the sense strand in an siRNA compound. Single-Stranded Antisense Compounds In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention are particularly suited for use as single-stranded antisense compounds. In certain such embodiments, such oligomeric compounds are single-stranded RNAi compounds. In certain embodiments, such oligomeric compounds are ssRNA compounds or microRNA mimics. Certain 5′-terminal nucleosides described herein are suited for use in such single-stranded oligomeric compounds. In certain embodiments, such 5′-terminal nucleosides stabilize the 5′-phosphorous moiety. In certain embodiments, 5′-terminal nucleosides of the present invention are resistant to nucleases. In certain embodiments, the motifs of the present invention are particularly suited for use in single-stranded oligomeric compounds. Use of single-stranded RNAi compounds has been limited. In certain instances, single stranded RNAi compounds are quickly degraded and/or do not load efficiently into RISC. Certain compounds of the present invention possess properties superior to previously described ssRNAi compounds. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention are superior ssRNAi compounds in vitro. In certain such embodiments, the 5′-terminal phosphorous moiety is stabilized. In certain such embodiments, the 5′-nucleoside is resistant to nuclease cleavage. In certain embodiments, the 5′-terminal end loads efficiently into RISC. In certain embodiments, the motif stabilizes the oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments the 3′-terminal end of the oligomeric compound is stabilized. Design of single-stranded RNAi compounds for use in cells and/or for use in vivo presents several challenges. For example, the compound must be chemically stable, resistant to nuclease degradation, capable of entering cells, capable of loading into RISC (e.g., binding Ago1 or Ago2), capable of hybridizing with a target nucleic acid, and not toxic to cells or animals. In certain instances, a modification or motif that improves one such feature may worsen another feature, rendering a compound having such modification or motif unsuitable for use as an RNAi compound. For example, certain modifications, particularly if placed at or near the 5′-end of an oligomeric compound, may make the compound more stable and more resistant to nuclease degradation, but may also inhibit or prevent loading into RISC by blocking the interaction with RISC components, such as Ago1 or Ago2. Despite its improved stability properties, such a compound would be unsuitable for use in RNAi. Thus, the challenge is to identify modifications and combinations and placement of modifications that satisfy each parameter at least sufficient to provide a functional single-stranded RNAi compound. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention combine modifications to provide single-stranded RNAi compounds that are active as single-stranded RNAi compounds. In certain instances, a single-stranded oligomeric compound comprising a 5′-phosphorous moiety is desired. For example, in certain embodiments, such 5′-phosphorous moiety is necessary or useful for RNAi compounds, particularly, single-stranded RNAi compounds. In such instances, it is further desirable to stabilize the phosphorous moiety against degradation or de-phosphorolation, which may inactivate the compound. Further, it is desirable to stabilize the entire 5′-nucleoside from degradation, which could also inactivate the compound. Thus, in certain embodiments, oligonucleotides in which both the 5′-phosphorous moiety and the 5′-nucleoside have been stabilized are desired. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides modified nucleosides that may be placed at the 5′-end of an oligomeric compound, resulting in stabilized phosphorous and stabilized nucleoside. In certain such embodiments, the phosphorous moiety is resistant to removal in biological systems, relative to unmodified nucleosides and/or the 5′-nucleoside is resistant to cleavage by nucleases. In certain embodiments, such nucleosides are modified at one, at two or at all three of: the 2′-position, the 5′-position, and at the phosphorous moiety. Such modified nucleosides may be incorporated at the 5′-end of an oligomeric compound. Although certain oligomeric compounds of the present invention have particular use as single-stranded compounds, such compounds may also be paired with a second strand to create a double-stranded oligomeric compound. In such embodiments, the second strand of the double-stranded duplex may or may not also be an oligomeric compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention bind and/or activate one or more nucleases. In certain embodiments, such binding and/or activation ultimately results in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, an oligomeric compound of the invention interacts with a target nucleic acid and with a nuclease, resulting in activation of the nuclease and cleavage of the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, an oligomeric compound of the invention interacts with a target nucleic acid and with a nuclease, resulting in activation of the nuclease and inactivation of the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, an oligomeric compound of the invention forms a duplex with a target nucleic acid and that duplex activates a nuclease, resulting in cleavage and/or inactivation of one or both of the oligomeric compound and the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, an oligomeric compound of the invention binds and/or activates a nuclease and the bound and/or activated nuclease cleaves or inactivates a target nucleic acid. Nucleases include, but are not limited to, ribonucleases (nucleases that specifically cleave ribonucleotides), double-strand nucleases (nucleases that specifically cleave one or both strands of a double-stranded duplex), and double-strand ribonucleases. For example, nucleases include, but are not limited to RNase H, an argonaute protein (including, but not limited to Ago2), and dicer. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention interact with an argonaute protein (Ago). In certain embodiments, such oligomeric compounds first enter the RISC pathway by interacting with another member of the pathway (e.g., dicer). In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds first enter the RISC pathway by interacting with Ago. In certain embodiments, such interaction ultimately results in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods of activating Ago comprising contacting Ago with an oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments, such oligomeric compounds comprise a modified 5′-phosphate group. In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods of modulating the expression or amount of a target nucleic acid in a cell comprising contacting the cell with an oligomeric compound capable of activating Ago, ultimately resulting in cleavage of the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the cell is in an animal. In certain embodiments, the cell is in vitro. In certain embodiments, the methods are performed in the presence of manganese. In certain embodiments, the manganese is endogenous. In certain embodiment the methods are performed in the absence of magnesium. In certain embodiments, the Ago is endogenous to the cell. In certain such embodiments, the cell is in an animal. In certain embodiments, the Ago is human Ago. In certain embodiments, the Ago is Ago2. In certain embodiments, the Ago is human Ago2. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention interact with the enzyme dicer. In certain such embodiments, oligomeric compounds bind to dicer and/or are cleaved by dicer. In certain such embodiments, such interaction with dicer ultimately results in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, the dicer is human dicer. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds that interact with dicer are double-stranded oligomeric compounds. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds that interact with dicer are single-stranded oligomeric compounds. In embodiments in which a double-stranded oligomeric compound interacts with dicer, such double-stranded oligomeric compound forms a dicer duplex. In certain embodiments, any oligomeric compound described herein may be suitable as one or both strands of a dicer duplex. In certain embodiments, each strand of the dicer duplex is an oligomeric compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments, one strand of the dicer duplex is an oligomeric compound of the present invention and the other strand is any modified or unmodified oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments, one or both strands of a dicer duplex comprises a nucleoside of Formula IIb or IIc at the 5′ end. In certain embodiments, one strand of a dicer duplex is an antisense oligomeric compound and the other strand is its sense complement. In certain embodiments, the dicer duplex comprises a 3′-overhang at one or both ends. In certain embodiments, such overhangs are additional nucleosides. In certain embodiments, the dicer duplex comprises a 3′ overhang on the sense oligonucleotide and not on the antisense oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, the dicer duplex comprises a 3′ overhang on the antisense oligonucleotide and not on the sense oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, 3′ overhangs of a dicer duplex comprise 1-4 nucleosides. In certain embodiments, such overhangs comprise two nucleosides. In certain embodiments, the nucleosides in the 3% overhangs comprise purine nucleobases. In certain embodiments, the nucleosides in the 3′ overhangs comprise adenine nucleobases. In certain embodiments, the nucleosides in the 3′ overhangs comprise pyrimidines. In certain embodiments, dicer duplexes comprising 3′-purine overhangs are more active as antisense compounds than dicer duplexes comprising 3′ pyrimidine overhangs. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of a dicer duplex comprise one or more 3′ deoxy nucleosides. In certain such embodiments, the 3′ deoxy nucleosides are dT nucleosides. In certain embodiments, the 5′ end of each strand of a dicer duplex comprises a phosphate moiety. In certain embodiments the antisense strand of a dicer duplex comprises a phosphate moiety and the sense strand of the dicer duplex does not comprise a phosphate moiety. In certain embodiments the sense strand of a dicer duplex comprises a phosphate moiety and the antisense strand of the dicer duplex does not comprise a phosphate moiety. In certain embodiments, a dicer duplex does not comprise a phosphate moiety at the 3′ end. In certain embodiments, a dicer duplex is cleaved by dicer. In such embodiments, dicer duplexes do not comprise 2′-OMe modifications on the nucleosides at the cleavage site. In certain embodiments, such cleavage site nucleosides are RNA. In certain embodiments, interaction of an oligomeric compound with dicer ultimately results in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, dicer cleaves one or both strands of a double-stranded oligomeric compound and the resulting product enters the RISC pathway, ultimately resulting in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, dicer does not cleave either strand of a double-stranded oligomeric compound, but nevertheless facilitates entry into the RISC pathway and ultimately results in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, dicer cleaves a single-stranded oligomeric compound and the resulting product enters the RISC pathway, ultimately resulting in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, dicer does not cleave the single-stranded oligomeric compound, but nevertheless facilitates entry into the RISC pathway and ultimately results in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods of activating dicer comprising contacting dicer with an oligomeric compound. In certain such embodiments, the dicer is in a cell. In certain such embodiments, the cell is in an animal. Dicer In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention interact with the enzyme dicer. In certain such embodiments, oligomeric compounds bind to dicer and/or are cleaved by dicer. In certain such embodiments, such interaction with dicer ultimately results in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, the dicer is human dicer. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds that interact with dicer are double-stranded oligomeric compounds. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds that interact with dicer are single-stranded oligomeric compounds. In embodiments in which a double-stranded oligomeric compound interacts with dicer, such double-stranded oligomeric compound forms a dicer duplex. In certain embodiments, any oligomeric compound described herein may be suitable as one or both strands of a dicer duplex. In certain embodiments, each strand of the dicer duplex is an oligomeric compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments, one strand of the dicer duplex is an oligomeric compound of the present invention and the other strand is any modified or unmodified oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments, one or both strands of a dicer duplex comprises a nucleoside of Formula IIb or IIc at the 5′. In certain embodiments, one strand of a dicer duplex is an antisense oligomeric compound and the other strand is its sense complement. In certain embodiments, the invention provides single-stranded oligomeric compounds that interact with dicer. In certain embodiments, such single-stranded dicer compounds comprise a nucleoside of Formula IIb or IIc. In certain embodiments, single-stranded dicer compounds do not comprise a phosphorous moiety at the 3′-end. In certain embodiments, such single-stranded dicer compounds may comprise a 3′-overhangs. In certain embodiments, such 3′-overhangs are additional nucleosides. In certain embodiments, such 3′-overhangs comprise 1-4 additional nucleosides that are not complementary to a target nucleic acid and/or are differently modified from the adjacent 3′ nucleoside of the oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments, a single-stranded oligomeric compound comprises an antisense oligonucleotide having two 3′-end overhang nucleosides wherein the overhang nucleosides are adenine or modified adenine nucleosides. In certain embodiments, single stranded oligomeric compounds that interact with dicer comprise a nucleoside of Formula IIb or IIc In certain embodiments, interaction of an oligomeric compound with dicer ultimately results in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, dicer cleaves one or both strands of a double-stranded oligomeric compound and the resulting product enters the RISC pathway, ultimately resulting in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, dicer does not cleave either strand of a double-stranded oligomeric compound, but nevertheless facilitates entry into the RISC pathway and ultimately results in antisense activity.

In certain such embodiments, the cell is in an animal. Ago In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention interact with Ago. In certain embodiments, such oligomeric compounds first enter the RISC pathway by interacting with another member of the pathway (e.g., dicer). In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds first enter the RISC pathway by interacting with Ago. In certain embodiments, such interaction ultimately results in antisense activity. In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods of activating Ago comprising contacting Ago with an oligomeric compound. In certain such embodiments, the Ago is in a cell. In certain such embodiments, the cell is in an animal. Oligomeric Compound Identity In certain embodiments, a portion of an oligomeric compound is 100% identical to the nucleobase sequence of a microRNA, but the entire oligomeric compound is not fully identical to the microRNA. In certain such embodiments, the length of an oligomeric compound having a 100% identical portion is greater than the length of the microRNA. For example, a microRNA mimic consisting of 24 linked nucleosides, where the nucleobases at positions 1 through 23 are each identical to corresponding positions of a microRNA that is 23 nucleobases in length, has a 23 nucleoside portion that is 100% identical to the nucleobase sequence of the microRNA and has approximately 96% overall identity to the nucleobase sequence of the microRNA. In certain embodiments, the nucleobase sequence of oligomeric compound is fully identical to the nucleobase sequence of a portion of a microRNA. For example, a single-stranded microRNA mimic consisting of 22 linked nucleosides, where the nucleobases of positions 1 through 22 are each identical to a corresponding position of a microRNA that is 23 nucleobases in length, is fully identical to a 22 nucleobase portion of the nucleobase sequence of the microRNA. Such a single-stranded microRNA mimic has approximately 96% overall identity to the nucleobase sequence of the entire microRNA, and has 100% identity to a 22 nucleobase portion of the microRNA.

The compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-, α or β, or as (D)- or (L)- such as for amino acids. Included herein are all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optical isomers may be prepared from their respective optically active precursors by the procedures described above, or by resolving the racemic mixtures. The resolution can be carried out in the presence of a resolving agent, by chromatography or by repeated crystallization or by some combination of these techniques which are known to those skilled in the art. Further details regarding resolutions can be found in Jacques, et al., Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions, John Wiley & Sons, 1981.

No. 4,725,677 and Re. 34,069. Synthesis of Oligomeric Compounds Oligomeric compounds are routinely prepared using solid support methods as opposed to solution phase methods. Commercially available equipment commonly used for the preparation of oligomeric compounds that utilize the solid support method is sold by several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.). Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. Suitable solid phase techniques, including automated synthesis techniques, are described in Oligonucleotides and Analogues, a Practical Approach, F. Eckstein, Ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1991. The synthesis of RNA and related analogs relative to the synthesis of DNA and related analogs has been increasing as efforts in RNA interference and micro RNA increase. The primary RNA synthesis strategies that are presently being used commercially include 5′-O-DMT-2′-O-t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), 5′-O-DMT-2′-O-[1(2-fluorophenyl)-4-methoxypiperidin-4-yl] (FPMP), 2′-O-[(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl (2′-O—CH2—O—Si(iPr)3 (TOM) and the 5′-O-silyl ether-T-ACE (5′-O-bis(trimethylsiloxy)cyclododecyloxysilyl ether (DOD)-2′-O-bis(2-acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE). A current list of some of the major companies currently offering RNA products include Pierce Nucleic Acid Technologies, Dharmacon Research Inc., Ameri Biotechnologies Inc., and Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. One company, Princeton Separations, is marketing an RNA synthesis activator advertised to reduce coupling times especially with TOM and TBDMS chemistries. The primary groups being used for commercial RNA synthesis are: TBDMS: 5′-O-DMT-2′-O-t-butyldimethylsilyl; TOM: 2′-O-[(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl; DOD/ACE: (5′-O-bis(trimethylsiloxy)cyclododecyloxysilyl ether-2′-O-bis(2-acetoxyethoxy)methyl; and FPMP: 5′-O-DMT-2′-O-[1(2-fluorophenyl)-4-ethoxypiperidin-4-yl]. In certain embodiments, each of the aforementioned RNA synthesis strategies can be used herein. In certain embodiments, the aforementioned RNA synthesis strategies can be performed together in a hybrid fashion e.g. using a 5′-protecting group from one strategy with a 2′-O-protecting from another strategy. Compositions and Methods for Formulating Pharmaceutical Compositions Oligomeric compounds may be admixed with pharmaceutically acceptable active and/or inert substances for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions or formulations. Compositions and methods for the formulation of pharmaceutical compositions are dependent upon a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, route of administration, extent of disease, or dose to be administered. Oligomeric compounds, including antisense compounds, can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions by combining such oligomeric compounds with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. A pharmaceutically acceptable diluent includes phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). PBS is a diluent suitable for use in compositions to be delivered parenterally. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, employed in the methods described herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antisense compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable diluent is PBS. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising oligomeric compounds encompass any pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, or salts of such esters. In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising oligomeric compounds comprise one or more oligonucleotide which, upon administration to an animal, including a human, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) the biologically active metabolite or residue thereof. Accordingly, for example, the disclosure is also drawn to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of antisense compounds, prodrugs, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such prodrugs, and other bioequivalents. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, sodium and potassium salts. A prodrug can include the incorporation of additional nucleosides at one or both ends of an oligomeric compound which are cleaved by endogenous nucleases within the body, to form the active oligomeric compound. Lipid-based vectors have been used in nucleic acid therapies in a variety of methods. In one method, the nucleic acid is introduced into preformed liposomes or lipoplexes made of mixtures of cationic lipids and neutral lipids. In another method, DNA complexes with mono- or poly-cationic lipids are formed without the presence of a neutral lipid. In certain methods, preparations are made that include a polyamine compound or a lipid moiety complexed with a nucleic acid. Such preparations are described in PCT publication WO/2008/042973; and in Akinc et al., Nature Biotechnology 26, 561-569 (1 May 2008), which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Certain Methods/Uses In certain embodiments, the present invention provides compounds and methods for reducing the amount or activity of a target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the invention provides antisense compounds and methods. In certain embodiments, the invention provides antisense compounds and methods based on activation of RNase H. In certain embodiments, the invention provides RNAi compounds and methods. In certain instances it is desirable to use an antisense compound that functions at least in part through RISC. In certain such instances unmodified RNA, whether single-stranded or double stranded is not suitable. Single-stranded RNA is relatively unstable and double-stranded RNA does not easily enter cells. The challenge has been to identify modifications and motifs that provide desirable properties, such as improved stability, without interfering with (and possibly even improving upon) the antisense activity of RNA through RNAi. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides oligonucleotides having motifs (nucleoside motifs and/or linkage motifs) that result in improved properties. Certain such motifs result in single-stranded oligonucleotides with improved stability and/or cellular uptake properties while retaining antisense activity. For example, oligonucleotides having an alternating nucleoside motif and seven phosphorothioate linkages at to 3′-terminal end have improved stability and activity. Similar compounds that comprise phosphorothioate linkages at each linkage have further improved stability, but are not active as RNAi compounds, presumably because the additional phosphorothioate linkages interfere with the interaction of the oligonucleotide with the RISC pathway components (e.g., with Ago). In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotides having motifs herein result in single-stranded RNAi compounds having desirable properties. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides may be paired with a second strand to form a double-stranded RNAi compound. In such embodiments, the second strand of such double-stranded RNAi compounds may comprise a motif of the present invention, may comprise another motif of modifications or may be unmodified. It has been shown that in certain circumstances for single-stranded RNA comprising a 5′-phosphate group has RNAi activity if but has much less RNAi activity if it lacks such 5′-phosphate group. The present inventors have recognized that in certain circumstances unmodified 5′-phophate groups may be unstable (either chemically or enzymatically). Accordingly, in certain circumstances, it is desirable to modify the oligonucleotide to stabilize the 5′-phosphate. In certain embodiments, this is achieved by modifying the phosphate group. In certain embodiments, this is achieved by modifying the sugar of the 5′-terminal nucleoside. In certain embodiments, this is achieved by modifying the phosphate group and the sugar. In certain embodiments, the sugar is modified at the 5′-position, the 2′-position, or both the 5′-position and the 2′-position. As with motifs, above, in embodiments in which RNAi activity is desired, a phosphate stabilizing modification must not interfere with the ability of the oligonucleotide to interact with RISC pathway components (e.g., with Ago). In certain embodiments, the invention provides oligonucleotides comprising a phosphate-stabilizing modification and a motif described herein. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides are useful as single-stranded RNAi compounds having desirable properties. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides may be paired with a second strand to form a double-stranded RNAi compound. In such embodiments, the second strand may comprise a motif of the present invention, may comprise another motif of modifications or may be unmodified RNA. The target for such antisense compounds comprising a motif and/or 5′-phosphate stabilizing modification of the present invention can be any naturally occurring nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the target is selected from: pre-mRNA, mRNA, non-coding RNA, small non-coding RNA, pd-RNA, and microRNA. In embodiments, in which a target nucleic acid is a pre-RNA or a mRNA, the target may be the same as that of a naturally occurring micro-RNA (i.e., the oligonucleotide may be a microRNA mimic). In such embodiments, there may be more than one target mRNA. In certain embodiments, the invention provides compounds and methods for antisense activity in a cell. In certain embodiments, the cell is in an animal. In certain embodiments, the animal is a human. In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods of administering a compound of the present invention to an animal to modulate the amount or activity or function of one or more target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments oligonucleotides comprise one or more motifs of the present invention, but do not comprise a phosphate stabilizing modification. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides are useful for in vitro applications. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides are useful for in vivo applications where RISC activity is not required. For example, in certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides alter splicing of pre-mRNA. Nonlimiting Disclosure and Incorporation by Reference While certain compounds, compositions and methods described herein have been described with specificity in accordance with certain embodiments, the following examples serve only to illustrate the compounds described herein and are not intended to limit the same. Each of the references, GenBank accession numbers, and the like recited in the present application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Although the sequence listing accompanying this filing identifies each sequence as either “RNA” or “DNA” as required, in reality, those sequences may be modified with any combination of chemical modifications. One of skill in the art will readily appreciate that such designation as “RNA” or “DNA” to describe modified oligonucleotides is, in certain instances, arbitrary. For example, an oligonucleotide comprising a nucleoside comprising a 2′-OH sugar moiety and a thymine base could be described as a DNA having a modified sugar (2′-OH for the natural 2′-H of DNA) or as an RNA having a modified base (thymine (methylated uracil) for natural uracil of RNA). EXAMPLES General 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz and 75 MHz Bruker spectrometer, respectively. Example 1 Synthesis of Nucleoside Phosphoramidites The preparation of nucleoside phosphoramidites is performed following procedures that are illustrated herein and in the art such as but not limited to U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,220 and published PCT WO 02/36743. Example 2 Synthesis of Oligomeric Compounds The oligomeric compounds used in accordance with this invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well-known technique of solid phase synthesis. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.). Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. It is well known to use similar techniques to prepare oligonucleotides such as alkylated derivatives and those having phosphorothioate linkages. Oligomeric compounds: Unsubstituted and substituted phosphodiester (P═O) oligomeric compounds, including without limitation, oligonucleotides can be synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 394) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry with oxidation by iodine. In certain embodiments, phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages (P═S) are synthesized similar to phosphodiester internucleoside linkages with the following exceptions: thiation is effected by utilizing a 10% w/v solution of 3,H-1,2-benzodithiole-3-one 1,1-dioxide in acetonitrile for the oxidation of the phosphite linkages. The thiation reaction step time is increased to 180 sec and preceded by the normal capping step. After cleavage from the CPG column and deblocking in concentrated ammonium hydroxide at 55° C. (12-16 hr), the oligomeric compounds are recovered by precipitating with greater than 3 volumes of ethanol from a 1 M NH4OAc solution. Phosphinate internucleoside linkages can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,270. Alkyl phosphonate internucleoside linkages can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat.

Example 3 Isolation and Purification of Oligomeric Compounds After cleavage from the controlled pore glass solid support or other support medium and deblocking in concentrated ammonium hydroxide at 55° C. for 12-16 hours, the oligomeric compounds, including without limitation oligonucleotides and oligonucleosides, are recovered by precipitation out of 1 M NH4OAc with >3 volumes of ethanol. Synthesized oligomeric compounds are analyzed by electrospray mass spectroscopy (molecular weight determination) and by capillary gel electrophoresis. The relative amounts of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester linkages obtained in the synthesis is determined by the ratio of correct molecular weight relative to the −16 amu product (+/−32+/−48). For some studies oligomeric compounds are purified by HPLC, as described by Chiang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1991, 266, 18162-18171. Results obtained with HPLC-purified material are generally similar to those obtained with non-HPLC purified material. Example 4 Synthesis of Oligomeric Compounds Using the 96 Well Plate Format Oligomeric compounds, including without limitation oligonucleotides, can be synthesized via solid phase P(III) phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated synthesizer capable of assembling 96 sequences simultaneously in a 96-well format. Phosphodiester internucleoside linkages are afforded by oxidation with aqueous iodine. Phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages are generated by sulfurization utilizing 3,H-1,2 benzodithiole-3-one 1,1 dioxide (Beaucage Reagent) in anhydrous acetonitrile. Standard base-protected beta-cyanoethyl-diiso-propyl phosphoramidites can be purchased from commercial vendors (e.g. PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., or Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.). Non-standard nucleosides are synthesized as per standard or patented methods and can be functionalized as base protected beta-cyanoethyldiisopropyl phosphoramidites. Oligomeric compounds can be cleaved from support and deprotected with concentrated NH4OH at elevated temperature (55-60° C.) for 12-16 hours and the released product then dried in vacuo. The dried product is then re-suspended in sterile water to afford a master plate from which all analytical and test plate samples are then diluted utilizing robotic pipettors. Example 5 Analysis of Oligomeric Compounds Using the 96-Well Plate Format The concentration of oligomeric compounds in each well can be assessed by dilution of samples and UV absorption spectroscopy. The full-length integrity of the individual products can be evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (CE) in either the 96-well format (Beckman P/ACE™ MDQ) or, for individually prepared samples, on a commercial CE apparatus (e.g., Beckman P/ACE™ 5000, ABI 270). Base and backbone composition is confirmed by mass analysis of the oligomeric compounds utilizing electrospray-mass spectroscopy. All assay test plates are diluted from the master plate using single and multi-channel robotic pipettors. Plates are judged to be acceptable if at least 85% of the oligomeric compounds on the plate are at least 85% full length. Example 6 In Vitro Treatment of Cells with Oligomeric Compounds The effect of oligomeric compounds on target nucleic acid expression is tested in any of a variety of cell types provided that the target nucleic acid is present at measurable levels. This can be routinely determined using, for example, PCR or Northern blot analysis. Cell lines derived from multiple tissues and species can be obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.). The following cell type is provided for illustrative purposes, but other cell types can be routinely used, provided that the target is expressed in the cell type chosen. This can be readily determined by methods routine in the art, for example Northern blot analysis, ribonuclease protection assays or RT-PCR. b.END cells: The mouse brain endothelial cell line b.END was obtained from Dr. Werner Risau at the Max Plank Institute (Bad Nauheim, Germany). b.END cells are routinely cultured in DMEM, high glucose (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells are routinely passaged by trypsinization and dilution when they reached approximately 90% confluence. Cells are seeded into 96-well plates (Falcon-Primaria #353872, BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass.) at a density of approximately 3000 cells/well for uses including but not limited to oligomeric compound transfection experiments. Experiments involving treatment of cells with oligomeric compounds: When cells reach appropriate confluency, they are treated with oligomeric compounds using a transfection method as described. Lipofectin™ When cells reached 65-75% confluency, they are treated with one or more oligomeric compounds. The oligomeric compound is mixed with LIPOFECTIN™ Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.) in Opti-MEM™-1 reduced serum medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.) to achieve the desired concentration of the oligomeric compound(s) and a LIPOFECTIN™ concentration of 2.5 or 3 μg/mL per 100 nM oligomeric compound(s). This transfection mixture is incubated at room temperature for approximately 0.5 hours. For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells are washed once with 100 μL OPTI-MEM™-1 and then treated with 130 μL of the transfection mixture. Cells grown in 24-well plates or other standard tissue culture plates are treated similarly, using appropriate volumes of medium and oligomeric compound(s). Cells are treated and data are obtained in duplicate or triplicate. After approximately 4-7 hours of treatment at 37° C., the medium containing the transfection mixture is replaced with fresh culture medium. Cells are harvested 16-24 hours after treatment with oligomeric compound(s). Other suitable transfection reagents known in the art include, but are not limited to, CYTOFECTINT™, LIPOFECTAMINE™, OLIGOFECTAMINE™, and FUGENE™. Other suitable transfection methods known in the art include, but are not limited to, electroporation. Example 7 Real-Time Quantitative PCR Analysis of Target mRNA Levels Quantitation of target mRNA levels is accomplished by real-time quantitative PCR using the ABI PRISM™ 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System (PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) according to manufacturer's instructions. This is a closed-tube, non-gel-based, fluorescence detection system which allows high-throughput quantitation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products in real-time. As opposed to standard PCR in which amplification products are quantitated after the PCR is completed, products in real-time quantitative PCR are quantitated as they accumulate. This is accomplished by including in the PCR reaction an oligonucleotide probe that anneals specifically between the forward and reverse PCR primers, and contains two fluorescent dyes. A reporter dye (e.g., FAM or JOE, obtained from either PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., Operon Technologies Inc., Alameda, Calif. or Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, Iowa) is attached to the 5′ end of the probe and a quencher dye (e.g., TAMRA, obtained from either PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., Operon Technologies Inc., Alameda, Calif. or Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, Iowa) is attached to the 3′ end of the probe. When the probe and dyes are intact, reporter dye emission is quenched by the proximity of the 3′ quencher dye. During amplification, annealing of the probe to the target sequence creates a substrate that can be cleaved by the 5′-exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase. During the extension phase of the PCR amplification cycle, cleavage of the probe by Taq polymerase releases the reporter dye from the remainder of the probe (and hence from the quencher moiety) and a sequence-specific fluorescent signal is generated. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, and the fluorescence intensity is monitored at regular intervals by laser optics built into the ABI PRISM™ Sequence Detection System. In each assay, a series of parallel reactions containing serial dilutions of mRNA from untreated control samples generates a standard curve that is used to quantitate the percent inhibition after antisense oligonucleotide treatment of test samples. Prior to quantitative PCR analysis, primer-probe sets specific to the target gene being measured are evaluated for their ability to be “multiplexed” with a GAPDH amplification reaction. In multiplexing, both the target gene and the internal standard gene GAPDH are amplified concurrently in a single sample. In this analysis, mRNA isolated from untreated cells is serially diluted. Each dilution is amplified in the presence of primer-probe sets specific for GAPDH only, target gene only (“single-plexing”), or both (multiplexing). Following PCR amplification, standard curves of GAPDH and target mRNA signal as a function of dilution are generated from both the single-plexed and multiplexed samples. If both the slope and correlation coefficient of the GAPDH and target signals generated from the multiplexed samples fall within 10% of their corresponding values generated from the single-plexed samples, the primer-probe set specific for that target is deemed multiplexable. Other methods of PCR are also known in the art. RT and PCR reagents are obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, Calif.). RT, real-time PCR is carried out by adding 20 μL PCR cocktail (2.5×PCR buffer minus MgCl2, 6.6 mM MgCl2, 375 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dCTP and dGTP, 375 nM each of forward primer and reverse primer, 125 nM of probe, 4 Units RNAse inhibitor, 1.25 Units PLATINUM® Taq, 5 Units MuLV reverse transcriptase, and 2.5×ROX dye) to 96-well plates containing 30 μL total RNA solution (20-200 ng). The RT reaction is carried out by incubation for 30 minutes at 48° C. Following a 10 minute incubation at 95° C. to activate the PLATINUM® Taq, 40 cycles of a two-step PCR protocol are carried out: 95° C. for 15 seconds (denaturation) followed by 60° C. for 1.5 minutes (annealing/extension). Gene target quantities obtained by RT, real-time PCR are normalized using either the expression level of GAPDH, a gene whose expression is constant, or by quantifying total RNA using RIBOGREEN™ (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.). GAPDH expression is quantified by real time RT-PCR, by being run simultaneously with the target, multiplexing, or separately. Total RNA is quantified using RiboGreen™ RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.). Methods of RNA quantification by RIBOGREEN™ are taught in Jones, L. J., et al, (Analytical Biochemistry, 1998, 265, 368-374). In this assay, 170 μL of RIBOGREEN™ working reagent (RIBOGREEN™ reagent diluted 1:350 in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) is pipetted into a 96-well plate containing 30 μL purified, cellular RNA. The plate is read in a CytoFluor 4000 (PE Applied Biosystems) with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm. Example 8 Analysis of Oligonucleotide Inhibition of Target Expression Antisense modulation of a target expression can be assayed in a variety of ways known in the art. For example, a target mRNA levels can be quantitated by, e.g., Northern blot analysis, competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or real-time PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR is presently desired. RNA analysis can be performed on total cellular RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA. One method of RNA analysis of the present disclosure is the use of total cellular RNA as described in other examples herein. Methods of RNA isolation are well known in the art. Northern blot analysis is also routine in the art. Real-time quantitative (PCR) can be conveniently accomplished using the commercially available ABI PRISM™ 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System, available from PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif. and used according to manufacturer's instructions. Protein levels of a target can be quantitated in a variety of ways well known in the art, such as immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis (immunoblotting), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Antibodies directed to a target can be identified and obtained from a variety of sources, such as the MSRS catalog of antibodies (Aerie Corporation, Birmingham, Mich.), or can be prepared via conventional monoclonal or polyclonal antibody generation methods well known in the art. Methods for preparation of polyclonal antisera are taught in, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 2, pp. 11.12.1-11.12.9, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997. Preparation of monoclonal antibodies is taught in, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 2, pp. 11.4.1-11.11.5, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997. Immunoprecipitation methods are standard in the art and can be found at, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 2, pp. 10.16.1-10.16.11, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1998. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis is standard in the art and can be found at, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 2, pp. 10.8.1-10.8.21, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are standard in the art and can be found at, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 2, pp. 11.2.1-11.2.22, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1991. Example 9 Design of Phenotypic Assays and In Vivo Studies for the Use of Target Inhibitors Phenotypic Assays Once target inhibitors have been identified by the methods disclosed herein, the oligomeric compounds are further investigated in one or more phenotypic assays, each having measurable endpoints predictive of efficacy in the treatment of a particular disease state or condition. Phenotypic assays, kits and reagents for their use are well known to those skilled in the art and are herein used to investigate the role and/or association of a target in health and disease. Representative phenotypic assays, which can be purchased from any one of several commercial vendors, include those for determining cell viability, cytotoxicity, proliferation or cell survival (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.; PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.), protein-based assays including enzymatic assays (Panvera, LLC, Madison, Wis.; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, N.J.; Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, Calif.), cell regulation, signal transduction, inflammation, oxidative processes and apoptosis (Assay Designs Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.), triglyceride accumulation (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), angiogenesis assays, tube formation assays, cytokine and hormone assays and metabolic assays (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, Calif.; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). In one non-limiting example, cells determined to be appropriate for a particular phenotypic assay (i.e., MCF-7 cells selected for breast cancer studies; adipocytes for obesity studies) are treated with a target inhibitors identified from the in vitro studies as well as control compounds at optimal concentrations which are determined by the methods described above. At the end of the treatment period, treated and untreated cells are analyzed by one or more methods specific for the assay to determine phenotypic outcomes and endpoints. Phenotypic endpoints include changes in cell morphology over time or treatment dose as well as changes in levels of cellular components such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, hormones, saccharides or metals. Measurements of cellular status which include pH, stage of the cell cycle, intake or excretion of biological indicators by the cell, are also endpoints of interest. Measurement of the expression of one or more of the genes of the cell after treatment is also used as an indicator of the efficacy or potency of the a target inhibitors. Hallmark genes, or those genes suspected to be associated with a specific disease state, condition, or phenotype, are measured in both treated and untreated cells. In Vivo Studies The individual subjects of the in vivo studies described herein are warm-blooded vertebrate animals, which includes humans. Example 10 RNA Isolation Poly(A)+ mRNA Isolation Poly(A)+ mRNA is isolated according to Miura et al., (Clin. Chem., 1996, 42, 1758-1764). Other methods for poly(A)+ mRNA isolation are routine in the art. Briefly, for cells grown on 96-well plates, growth medium is removed from the cells and each well is washed with 200 μL cold PBS. 60 μL lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 20 mM vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex) is added to each well, the plate is gently agitated and then incubated at room temperature for five minutes. 55 μL of lysate is transferred to Oligo d(T) coated 96-well plates (AGCT Inc., Irvine Calif.). Plates are incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, washed 3 times with 200 μL of wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 M NaCl). After the final wash, the plate is blotted on paper towels to remove excess wash buffer and then air-dried for 5 minutes. 60 μL of elution buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6), preheated to 70° C., is added to each well, the plate is incubated on a 90° C. hot plate for 5 minutes, and the eluate is then transferred to a fresh 96-well plate. Cells grown on 100 mm or other standard plates may be treated similarly, using appropriate volumes of all solutions. Total RNA Isolation Total RNA is isolated using an RNEASY 96™ kit and buffers purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, Calif.) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. Briefly, for cells grown on 96-well plates, growth medium is removed from the cells and each well is washed with 200 μL cold PBS. 150 μL Buffer RLT is added to each well and the plate vigorously agitated for 20 seconds. 150 μl, of 70% ethanol is then added to each well and the contents mixed by pipetting three times up and down. The samples are then transferred to the RNEASY 96™ well plate attached to a QIAVAC™ manifold fitted with a waste collection tray and attached to a vacuum source. Vacuum is applied for 1 minute. 500 μL of Buffer RW1 is added to each well of the RNEASY 96™ plate and incubated for 15 minutes and the vacuum is again applied for 1 minute. An additional 500 μL of Buffer RW1 is added to each well of the RNEASY 96™ plate and the vacuum is applied for 2 minutes. 1 mL of Buffer RPE is then added to each well of the RNEASY 96™ plate and the vacuum applied for a period of 90 seconds. The Buffer RPE wash is then repeated and the vacuum is applied for an additional 3 minutes. The plate is then removed from the QIAVAC™ manifold and blotted dry on paper towels. The plate is then re-attached to the QIAVAC™ manifold fitted with a collection tube rack containing 1.2 mL collection tubes. RNA is then eluted by pipetting 140 μL of RNAse free water into each well, incubating 1 minute, and then applying the vacuum for 3 minutes. The repetitive pipetting and elution steps may be automated using a QIAGEN Bio-Robot 9604 (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia Calif.). Essentially, after lysing of the cells on the culture plate, the plate is transferred to the robot deck where the pipetting, DNase treatment and elution steps are carried out. Example 11 Target-Specific Primers and Probes Probes and primers may be designed to hybridize to a target sequence, using published sequence information. For example, for human PTEN, the following primer-probe set was designed using published sequence information (GENBANK™ accession number U92436.1, SEQ ID NO: 1). Forward primer: (SEQ ID NO: 2) AATGGCTAAGTGAAGATGACAATCAT Reverse primer: (SEQ ID NO: 3) TGCACATATCATTACACCAGTTCGT And the PCR probe: FAM-TTGCAGCAATTCACTGTAAAGCTGGAAAGG-TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 4), where FAM is the fluorescent dye and TAMRA is the quencher dye. Example 12 Western Blot Analysis of Target Protein Levels Western blot analysis (immunoblot analysis) is carried out using standard methods. Cells are harvested 16-20 h after oligonucleotide treatment, washed once with PBS, suspended in Laemmli buffer (100 μl/well), boiled for 5 minutes and loaded on a 16% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels are run for 1.5 hours at 150 V, and transferred to membrane for western blotting. Appropriate primary antibody directed to a target is used, with a radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled secondary antibody directed against the primary antibody species. Bands are visualized using a PHOSPHORIMAGER™ (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale Calif.). Example 13 Preparation of Compound 3 a) Preparation of Compound 2 Commercially available 1,2;5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-α-D-allofuranose, Compound 1, (135 g, 519.0 mmol) and 2-(bromomethyl)-naphthalene (126 g, 570.0 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (500 mL) in a three-necked flask (500 mL) and the reaction was cooled in an ice bath. Sodium hydride (60% w/w, 29 g, 727.0 mmol) was carefully added (6 g portions every 10 minutes) to the reaction and the stirring was continued for another 60 minutes after the addition was complete. At this time TLC analysis showed no more sugar (Compound 1). The reaction was carefully poured onto crushed ice (ca. 500 g) and the resulting slurry was stirred vigorously until all the ice melted. The resulting off-white solid was collected by filtration and suspended in water. The suspension was stirred vigorously using a mechanical stirrer for 30 minutes after which the solid was collected by filtration and suspended in hexanes. The suspension was stirred vigorously for 30 minutes after which the solid was collected by filtration and air dried for 4-6 hours and then dried under high vacuum over P2O5 for 16 hours to provide Compound 2 (206.0 g, 99%) as an off-white solid. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 7.85 (m, 4H), 7.48 (m, 3H), 5.74 (s, 1H), 4.92 (d, 1H, J=11.7), 4.75 (d, 1H, J=11.6), 4.58 (m, 1H), 4.36 (m, 1H), 4.15 (m, 1H), 4.03-3.86 (m, 3H), 1.61 (s, 3H), 1.36 (s, 9H). b) Preparation of Compound 3 Compound 2 (200.0 g, 0.5 moles) was added in small portions to a solution of acetic acid (2.2 L) and water (740 mL). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 16 h after which, TLC analysis (30% EtOAc/hexanes) indicated complete consumption of Compound 2. The reaction was then concentrated under reduced pressure until most of the acetic acid was removed. The remaining solution was poured into a stirred mixture of EtOAc (1 L) and water (1 L). Solid KOH was then added to the above mixture until the aqueous layer was strongly basic (pH>12). The organic layer was then separated, washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and brine then dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to provide Compound 3 as a yellow foam, which was used without any further purification.

Example 15 Preparation of Compounds 15 and 16 Compound 4 is prepared as per the procedures illustrated in Example 14. Example 16 Preparation of Compounds 17 and 18 Compound 14 was prepared as per the procedures illustrated in Example 15.
