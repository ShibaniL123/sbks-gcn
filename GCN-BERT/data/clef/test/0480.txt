FIELD The present invention relates generally to a sports training device. In particular, it relates to a portable elastic sports training device which can be attached to a sports goal at a variety of locations, and methods related thereto. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In many sports such as hockey, soccer, lacrosse and water polo, it is desirable for a player to accurately throw, kick, hit or shoot a projectile to a specific location in a goal during a game to score more effectively. For example, in soccer, there are locations in a goal which are very difficult for the goal tending player to block a ball from entering the goal and scoring. Consequently, it is desirable for athletes to improve their throwing, kicking or shooting accuracy by practicing aiming at a physical practice target which visually focuses their attention to one or more such particular locations within the goal. Such a practice target is typically a sports training device and not used in actual game play. The practice target is transported to the practice setting and attached to the goal in one or more places during a practice session. The target may be reattached during the session to practice aiming at different locations in the goal. Therefore, portability in terms of both weight and size and the ease of attachment and reattachment are important. Beyond the portability and ease of use, the practice target device should to be safe to use. Athletes moving at fast speeds may accidentally collide with the practice target and injure themselves if the practice target device has hard or rigid parts. Goal keepers typically play near the front plane of the goal with their backs to the goal, so they would be especially prone to collision with any practice target attached to the goal posts. Therefore, targets with rigid frames or planes can be quite unsafe for the players. A practice target which has all of the above attributes is needed by players of many goal-based sports. Many practice targets have been developed, but none of these practice targets is flexible for safety to the players yet able to support itself in many locations within the goal, as well as tough, small, light, and can be easily attached to and removed from almost all portions of the goal. Many examples of these previously developed practice targets comprise rigid frames, faces, or both, rendering them unsafe for use. For example, U.S. Pat. 7,252,604 B2 issued to Birss on Aug. 7, 2007 describes a target with a frame “preferably comprised of rounded steel bar” (col. 15, line 18) which can easily injure the players. Other examples suffer from limited placement locations within the goal thus limiting effectiveness and utility. Specifically, U.S. Pat. No. 8,187,123 B2 issued to Pettys et al, on May 29, 2012 describes a target hung from hooks only from the “top horizontal crossbar of the soccer goal,” and cannot be mounted to the side posts or the net, preventing its use for practicing shots in the important lower corners or along the middle of the side posts. Yet other targets are difficult to use. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,245,843 issued to Griggs on Jan. 20, 1981 describes a target which must be reassembled after each hit, increasing the set up time significantly. For widespread adoption of a sports practice target device to occur, the target device must be safe, effective, portable and easy to use. The prior art offers no such device, and a solution is still needed. The present disclosure describes a safe, effective, portable, and easy to use practice target device which addresses this pressing need. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to generally to a sports training device. More specifically, it relates to a portable and flexible practice target device which can be attached to a sports goal at a variety of locations to enable an individual to practice and improve throwing, kicking or shooting accuracy of balls, pucks or other projectiles with or without goal keeper and other players participating in practice. In one embodiment a sports practice device is disclosed. The sports practice device comprising: a sheet of elastomeric material, having: a planar surface and a depth, an edge of the planar surface, oriented perpendicular to an external lateral surface when viewed perpendicular to the depth, and a property of remaining essentially planar when held by a portion of the sheet proximate to the edge; and a detachable attachment, connected to the elastomeric material. According to a second embodiment of the invention a method of designing a sports practice target is described. The method comprising: providing a target goal size and a target aiming distance from the goal; determining a target face diameter based on the target goal size and target aiming distance; selecting a sheet of elastomer material with suitable durometer and thickness for the target face diameter; constructing a test sample; testing the mechanical strength of the test sample for a property of remaining essentially planar and perpendicular to an external lateral surface when held by a portion of the test sample proximate to the edge and selecting an attachment. In a different aspect of the invention, a method of manufacturing a sports practice target is described. The method comprising: forming a target from an elastomer material; placing a visual aid on a target face portion; and attaching a detachable attachment.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure describes a sports training device. The device is an elastic portable target which can be easily attached to and removed from a sports goal at many perimeter or net locations for the purpose of practicing aim and improving accuracy of shot. The sports training device of the present disclosure is not limited in utility to mounting on a sports goal, nor is it limited for use during practice. The device can also be mounted to any designated location such as a pole where a person wishes to mark for aim such as in Frisbee golf or a game of horse. As a training device, the sports training device can be carried to a practice location, attached and used, then removed and carried away at the end of the practice session. Therefore, it is desirable for the device to be small in size and weight for portability and also easily and quickly attachable and removable from various portions of the goal to facilitate ease and range of use. The training device functions more effectively and safely if it is flexible but tough, durable, and tear-resistant enough to withstand multiple contacts with the players and projectiles such as balls or pucks. It is also desirable for the device to be resistant to environmental hazards such as wind, water, ice, chlorine, salt, sunlight, heat and cold. It should not crack or fade after reasonable use. The training device of the present disclosure is able to address these needs of safety, ease of use, portability and effectiveness through one or more of specific material selection, target configuration, and target marking. Referring now to FIG. 1, shown is a front view of an embodiment of the sports training device, or portable target device (herein referred to as “target” or “device”) of the present disclosure. The target 10 is depicted as mounted horizontally to a vertical goal post 30 of a water polo goal as an example. Also shown in FIG. 1 is the water polo goal net 20. The target 10 may be attached with horizontal or vertical orientation onto various portions of the vertical or horizontal goal post. For example, the target can be attached to the lower portion of the vertical goal post, the center or edge part of the horizontal goal post, the upper right corner of the net, or the lower left corner of the net. The target 10 can also be attached to various portions of the goal net 20. The range of possible attachment location and orientation for the target makes the device very effective in addressing aim within a goal. The device, at least the portions which are projected out of the goal post, is flexible. Unlike many targets in the prior art, the target does not have rigid parts or frame around or near the target face. Referring now to FIG. 2, shown herein is a perspective view of an embodiment of the target 10. The target 10 comprises a target face portion 40, a target arm portion 50, a mounting surface portion 60, and an attachment 80. The target can be made of one or more sheets of elastomeric material. If more than one sheet is used, the sheets can be laminated, glued, stitched or otherwise attached together. All or parts of one or more of the target face portion 40, the target arm portion 50, and the mounting surface portion 60, can be made from the sheet of elastomeric material. For example, the target face portion 40, the target arm portion 50, and the mounting surface portion 60 of the target 10 may be one single continuous sheet of elastomeric sheet material. This configuration may be lower in manufacturing cost due to simpler construction. However, it is possible for at least parts of any of the abovementioned portion to be manufactured separately and then combined. For example, the target face portion 40 which may be integrated with the target arm portion 50 as one continuous piece, with the mounting surface portion 60 made separately then stitched or glued or otherwise attached together. In another example, a second reinforcement sheet may be glued or laminated on the target arm portion 50 to improve toughness, mechanical stability, and tear resistance. As yet another example, the target face portion 40, the target arm portion 50, and the mounting surface portion 60 may all be integrated as one continuous piece with the same or different thickness and/or material properties. In other embodiments, all or portions of the target face portion 40, the target arm portion 50 and the mounting surface portion 60 may be made from more than one piece of material then attached. The target face portion 40, the target arm portion 50, and the mounting surface portion 60 of the target 10 may be of same or different thickness and/or material properties such as durometer. Any portion of the target face portion 40, the target arm portion 50, and the mounting surface portion 60 may have one or more additional sheets of elastomeric or other material attached to it by gluing, lamination, stitching or other methods. Similar to the prior example where a second reinforcement sheet may be glued or laminated on the target arm portion 50 to improve toughness and tear resistance, reinforcement may be provided by increasing the durometer of the target arm portion during the formation of the sheet. Yet a third method of reinforcing the target arm portion 50 may be by inserting a fiber matrix or foam insert. The mounting surface portion 60 of the target 10 may have one or more attachment holes 70 that allow an attachment 80 to pass though the interior of the mounting surface portion 60. FIG. 2 shows a specific example of three (3) slot shaped attachment holes 70 spaced unequally in one row. The attachment holes can be long slots, round, oval, or other shapes. More than one row of attachment holes may be used. The attachment holes 70 do not all have to be the same shape, nor do all rows of attachment holes 70 have to be the same. The attachment holes can be positioned symmetric about a center line of the mounting surface portion 60 as shown in FIG. 2. The mounting surface portion 60 and the attachment 80 of the target 10 do not have to be made of elastomeric material since it is not intended to extend beyond the goal post when mounted. Therefore, the mounting surface portion 60 and attachment 80 may be made of rigid materials as long as there are no dangerous protrusions or sharp corners. The mounting surface portion 60 may be made of a softer or thinner material to better conform to a goal post. The example attachment 80 shown in FIG. 2 has an adjustable webbing strap with a large hook and eye closure. However, the attachment 80 can have zero, one or more straps. An example of an attachment 80 with no separate strap uses the mounting surface portion 60, itself, as the strap by stitching fabric hook and eye closure (e.g. Velcro®) at two ends of the mounting surface portion 60. The mounting surface portion 60 would wrap around a goal post and be held in position by the fabric hook and eye closure. The strap of the attachment 80 can be adjustable in length and/or be elastic to fit on various sizes of posts or netting, or other places to attach the target 10. The strap can be made of leather, polymer such as rubber or silicone, fabric such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, cotton or any combination thereof. The strap can be of many forms, such as tubing, belt, rope or webbing. The attachment 80 can include one or more securing device such as a buckle, fabric hook and eye closure (e.g. Velcro®), hook, tie or other. The attachment 80 can also include loops, guides, etc. to for adjustments in length and for managing excess strap. One or more of the target face portion 40, the target arm portion 50, and the mounting surface portion 60 of the target 10 may be primarily made of an elastomer. An elastomer is defined as a polymer which can reversibly extend 5-700%. The measure of mechanical strength, hardness, and resistance to deformation (elastic modulus) for elastic polymer can be quantified by the Shore durometer or durometer reading. The term refers to the measurement as well as the instrument itself. Durometer A and durometer D are different scales for targeting elastomers for different uses. A larger force is applied during a measurement of durometer D compared to durometer A, thus durometer D scale values indicate more resistant or harder material for the same reading as durometer A. Within each scale, a larger number indicate harder or more resistant material. Elastomers with a durometer type A readings of approximately 80A to 120A or a durometer D reading of 35D to 70D are suitable for the target of the present disclosure. Some examples of elastomers with durometers within this range include Polyurethane, Latex (natural or synthetic rubber emulsion), natural rubber, polychloroprene such as Neoprene®, EPDM rubber (ethylene propylene diene monomer (M-class) rubber), Polyethylene, CSPE (chlorosulfonated polyethylene) synthetic rubber (CSM) such as Hypalon®, synthetic rubber and fluoropolymer elastomers such as Viton®, and TPE (thermal plastic elastomers) such as Santoprene®. The elastomer may be a solid film, molded foam or other. Proper selection of target planar dimensions combined with the elastomer material, thickness, and durometer, enable the formation of a target of the present disclosure with suitable size and shape. The target is sized for visibility from typical playing distance as well as player experience level. Typically a circular disk shaped target face portion 40 of a diameter of 4 inches to 12 inches is preferred for portability and visibility. A circular disk shaped target face portion 40 is shown in FIG. 2. A circular type of target face is the simplest to construct. Square, rectangular shapes with length equal target face diameter can also be used. The rectangular or square shapes may have rounded corners or dual semicircle ends. Since sharp corners may present some dangers to players, rounded edges are preferred. Oval shapes can also be used, with maximum diameter equal to the circular target face diameter. Oval or rounded rectangular shaped target face may be useful in covering a desired aiming area in rectangular goals with large aspect ratios while keeping weight lower than a circular shape with the same maximum diameter. The target face portion 40 and at least the target arm portion 50 should have enough elasticity to be durable and safe. The elasticity should be high enough such that the target does not hurt the body when the target face portion 40 is contacted at typical player speeds. The target 10 also is elastic enough to be durable to withstand at least thousands of contacts with the players' ball, puck or other projectile aimed at the target 10. Finally, the target face portion and the target arm portion 50 may have enough hardness and rigidity, as indicated by the shore durometer reading, to support the target face when horizontally mounted on a post or vertically mounted on a net without folding. The target can be easily attached, such as by strapping to a vertical goal post, horizontal crossbar, or other rigid mounting structure within seconds. The target can also be attached to the net of the goal, or other structures which is the focus of aim. One or more of the target face portion 40, the target arm portion 50, and the mounting surface portion 60 of the target 10 may be produced from a sheet of elastomeric material by molding, cutting, punching, or stamping. One or more of the target face portion 40, the target arm portion 50, and the mounting surface portion 60 of the target 10 may have additional designs, logos, advertisement, drawings, etc. on its surface or punched out for effectiveness, usability, or other reasons. Visual aids can be painted, laminated, colored, punched, stamped or otherwise rendered visible on various portions of the target to increase its visibility and effectiveness. For example a bull's eye circle may be painted on the target face portion 40 for increased visibility, the bull's eye might be cut out to reduce weight, or a logo may be placed on the target for advertisement purposes. The elastomeric material for the target is best to have reasonable tolerance of environmental hazards such as wind, water, ice, chlorine, salt, sunlight, heat and cold. It should not crack or fade after reasonable use. For ease of manufacturing, the material can be easily colored and cut. It can be stable over temperature such that it does not droop or fold in a hot summer day or to turn hard and brittle on a cold winter day. Other properties such as tear resistance and toughness are also important. Other components may be integrated in the elastomer material to improve its mechanical properties for use. For example, clothe or fiber matrix, such as cotton, polyester, or fiberglass may be formed within an elastomer material of any of the abovementioned base elastomers for improving tear resistance of the fabricated target of the present disclosure. The elastomer thickness and durometer, combined with the target shape and dimensions, may be adjusted separately or in combination for various target sizes or functions. Different targets may be differently engineered for different sport or even different aspects of the sport. For example, a water polo target may have a different shape; smaller size, thinner material, and lower durometer than a soccer target since water polo balls are thrown with arm rather than kicked with foot so tend to be of shorter range. In addition, desired accuracy and precision levels even within a single sport may be different for beginner, intermediate and expert level player thus requiring different size, durometer, or visual aid level. Therefore, the size and configuration would be optimized for each specific use, for example water polo, soccer, lacrosse and hockey. The size and configuration would then lead to the choice of elastomeric material, durometer and thickness for each portion of the target 10. Referring now to FIG. 6, shown herein is a flow chart of a method 100 to design a sports practice target device of the present disclosure. The method includes providing a goal size and an aiming distance in a step 110. The provided goal size and aiming distance would depend on the type of sport and the skill level of the athlete. A soccer goal is quite large at 24 feet wide by 8 feet high with player kicking the ball in at large distances. A hockey goal is much smaller at 6 feet wide and 4 feet high. The method includes a step 120: determining a target face diameter by the goal size and aiming distance indicated by the skill level of the athlete. Larger target face diameter is indicated by larger goal farther aiming distance, and more novice players. Typical target face diameter would be 2-15% of the goal width, although for larger goals, target face diameters of 1-5% of goal width may be more appropriate to maintain portability. 4″ to 12″ are the typical target face diameter ranges, although for beginner players, even larger targets may be more suitable. A good target face diameter to start would be 5% of goal width. The determined target face diameter can also be applied to the maximum diameter of an oval target face or the length of a rounded rectangle or square target face. In a next step 130, the method includes selecting an elastomeric material and starting target depth or thickness. Based on the target face diameter, an elastomeric material and thickness, or target depth is chosen. Polyurethane is a good starting material with a durometer A reading of 100A and thickness of 1/16″. The durometer and thickness is chosen based on the projected weight of the target at the determined diameter. To preserve portability, the target can be smaller than 36″ and weighing less than a pound. The target is preferred to weigh less than a half of pound. Density of the elastomeric material may be a selection criterion. Typical elastomeric films have densities of 0.9-1.5 g/cc. For lower density and thus lower weight in larger targets, elastomeric foams such as polyurethane foam may be used. Selected inserts or fillers may be incorporated to increase stiffness or weight in one or more portions of the target. Such inserts or fillers may be uniformly distributed or concentrated in one or more areas. Fillers, such as filler bead may be added to increase or decrease density or fibers to add tear resistance. Stiffeners may include polycarbonate sheet insert. Fillers, fibers, and stiffeners may be incorporated into elastomer sheets or elastomer foam by the use of molds or molding. In a next step 140, the method further includes constructing a test sample with a target arm length equal to target arm width equal to target face diameter as shown in FIG. 7. The target face diameter is used as an approximate size scale. A pre-determined length of mounting surface 60 can be added to the target arm length. The length of the target arm 50 of FIG. 2 is expected to be zero to ˜1 times the target face diameter. Targets with arm length significantly larger than the target face diameter are not as stable. The width of the target arm is expected to be about 20-70% of the target face diameter but may be up to 100%. Target arms with larger length and width can be visually distracting and may have blackout visual aid on them. For the initial test, a test sample is constructed by cutting or molding the selected elastomeric material with the determined target face diameter and a target arm with length and width equal to the target face diameter and a pre-determined length of mounting surface 60. As shown in FIG. 7, slots do not need to be cut for the test sample, thus the target arm and mounting surface may be interchangeable portions of the test sample. The non-circular portion of the test sample that is clamped or tied against the post would be the mounting surface and the exposed portion would be the target arm. In a following step 150, the weight of the test sample is measured. If the weight is too high, in excess of a pound for a typically sized target, the target may not be portable enough for use. A new elastomeric material with higher durometer is chosen in a step 155 and a new target thickness and density is selected for the new material by returning to step 130. Flexibility of the test sample is also tested in step 150 although it is not shown explicitly in FIG. 6. Flexibility or elasticity of the test sample is important for safety. The sample is considered flexible enough if it deflects perceptibly with the human eye and touch when 3 pounds of force is applied to any point or area of the mounted target arm or face. If the weight and the flexibility of the test sample are acceptable, then the test sample is tested for mechanical stability in a step 160. The test is conducted at 130 deg F with the mounting surface 60 of the test sample 200 clamped to a vertical post 30 by a portion of the mounting surface and/or target arm. A suitable, “passing” sample is characterized by sufficient hardness and rigidity to support the target face to present a substantially planar configuration without folding. FIG. 7 shows a perspective view of an example testing configuration. The test sample 200 is attached, by a clamp 210, strap or other methods holding a portion of the mounting surface/target arm 50 and 60 and exposing a desired target arm length 15. Only a small portion of the mounting surface 60 placed against the vertical post 30 is held by the clamp 210 for this test, about 5-15% of its total width and length. The portion of the mounting surface 60 extending beyond the vertical post 30 does not contribute to the test, thus the clamp holds a portion of the sample which would be proximate to the lateral edge of the sample 200. Although FIG. 7 shows the clamp 210 as being position toward the top half of the test sample 200, the test is performed with the clamp preferably positioned closer to the center line of the test sample to detect sample folding. The test sample is held such that an edge 42 of target face plane 40 is oriented perpendicular to an external lateral surface 220 (e.g. table, gym floor, pool water level or playing field ground) when viewed perpendicular to the thickness or depth of the test sample. The target face 40 plane is perpendicular the external lateral surface 220 and parallel to the vertical mounting post 30. The initial target face plane is considered to be vertical at 90 deg perpendicular to the external lateral surface 220. The test sample 200 is oriented with the target arm 50 positioned lateral to the target face 40 instead of above or below. This lateral asymmetric configuration is found to be a good mechanical test for the elastomeric material. The length of the target arm 15 in the test sample 200 can be reduced by clamping portions of the target arm 50 against the mounting surface to effectively reduce the target arm length all the way to zero. This is a way to test different effective target arm length 15 without actually cutting the sample. The mechanical test of step 160 starts with a target arm length 50 of zero. If the elastomeric material of the test sample 200 is not hard or rigid enough, the target face 40 plane will not remain planar and perpendicular to the external lateral surface 220 (ground) during the test. Instead the material will fold, especially when heated to 130 deg F for 1 hour. If the sample folds anytime at or before the end of the 1 hour testing at 130 deg F then the sample is considered to have failed this test. Folding is defined as a bending of any portion of the test sample of more than 15 degrees from vertical or less than 75 degrees from the external lateral surface 220. The temperature on a hot playing field can get above 100 deg F and it is well known that polymer materials can creep under heat. The stability of the planar configuration without fold is also important since the target may be used under windy conditions and the goal may be shaken. Thus, the test set up may be shaken to ensure the test sample 200 remains planar. The test described here is a test of mechanical stability and hardness for the elastomeric sheet utilizing the material's own weight and is specifically used to determine if the elastomeric material is suitable for the use described in the present disclosure. If the test sample 200 fails the mechanical test of step 160 and folds, then a thicker sheet is selected or reinforcement material, such as a fiber matrix, is added and a new test sample is constructed by returning to step 140. If the test sample 200 passed the mechanical test of step 160 with a target arm length 15 of zero, then further testing can be done with increased target arm length 15 to determine the maximum target arm length 15 allowable by the material to select the elastomeric material, target depth, and maximum target arm length in a step 170. In a step 180, target arm width 35 is decreased by cutting an increment from both sides. FIG. 6 shows an example increment where a total reduction of 25% is used each time. The mechanical test at 130 deg F in step 160 is repeated until the test sample 200 fails and a minimum target arm width 35 is determined. In a last step 190, the prior arm width is selected and an attachment is also selected. Optionally and not shown in FIG. 6, a visual aid can be designed. Referring now to FIG. 3, a perspective view of another embodiment of the target 10 is shown have a target face thickness 24, a target arm thickness 25 and a mounting surface thickness 26. Any two or all three of the target face thickness 24, the target arm thickness 25 and the mounting surface thickness 26 may be the same or different. If all three thicknesses are the same as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4 and the durometer required is the same, the target may be fabricated from a continuous piece of elastomer. If different mechanical property is required of the target face portion 40, the target arm portion 50 and the mounting surface 60, the three portions can still be fabricated from one continuous piece of elastomer. For example, additional pieces of materials, which can be elastomers, can be laminated or glue to one or more portions to change the mechanical property of that portion. FIG. 3 shows an additional piece of elastomer 25 attached to the target arm portion of the target 10. The additional strengthening piece may be used to increase target arm length, where longer length is desired. In FIG. 3, a visual aid filled circled is shown painted on the center of the target face portion of the target to form a bull's eye. A striped black out pattern is shown on the target arm portion. Such pattern can be used to reduce the visual registration for that portion of the target and to focus attention on the target face portion. Other visual aids may include logos, cutouts, or blacking out various portions of the target to make the target face portion more prominent. The target face portion can be colored by a highly visible color such as yellow. Referring now to FIG. 4, shown is a front view of the embodiment of the practice target in FIG. 2 next to a goal post 30 of FIG. 1. The target face portion 40 of FIG. 2 has a round shape with a target face diameter 14 based on the visibility and size requirement of the sport. A pre-determined aim distance from the goal post constrains the length 15 of the target arm portion 50 as well as the target arm thickness 25 and durometer of the target arm 50 as described by the design method in FIG. 6. Longer target arm length 15 may be enabled by attaching additional strengthening piece such as shown in FIG. 3. The minimum and maximum typical diameter of the goal post and attachment hole 7 requirements can be used to determine the mounting surface length 16. The target face thickness 24 and durometer of the target can be specified as to make the target as flexible for safety reasons, but strong enough to present a flat target face portion 40 that does not droop or fold under its own weight tested by the method shown in FIG. 6. In an embodiment of the sports training device for water polo use, the target face 40 is substantially round and the target face diameter 14 is 5-9 inches, the elastomer material is a 120A durometer polyurethane sheet of about 1/16-¼ inches thick. The target arm portion 50, mounting surface portion 60, and the target face portion 40 are constructed as a single continuous piece. The target arm portion 50 is 0-4 inches long and 3 inches wide. These parameters result in a target arm portion 50 soft and flexible enough to absorb the shock of a projectile hit and not hurt players should they contact the target, yet strong enough to present a flat target face portion 40 without drooping or folding due to its own weight. The radius of curvature 18 for the transition between the target face portion 40 and target arm portion 5 in this example embodiment is 1.5 inches. A larger radius minimizes the stress density between target face portion 40 and the target arm portion 50 when a projectile hits the target face portion 40 and reduces the likelihood of tearing. The transition radius can be much smaller than 1.5 inches but having higher radius can improve the tear strength. In the embodiment, the mounting surface length 16 is in the range of 4-6 inches with a width of about 3 inches. FIG. 5 shows a top view of the embodiment of the target 10 where the mounting surface length 16 is large enough to secure the target 10 to the goal post 30, and short enough preferably to not overlap itself by being longer than the perimeter of the goal post 30. The attachment device 80 can goes through attachment holes 70 in the mounting surface portion 60 and around the goal post 30, securing the target 10 into position. Methods of Manufacture One affordable method to manufacture this invention is to form the targets from a sheet or roll of elastomer material. The forming can be as simple as cutting with shears, or cutting can be done by more complex machinery such as stamp, laser, die punch or other machine cutting. Since the target face can be integrated with the target arm which can be integrated with the mounting surface, a one-piece elastic target can be produced with one punch. Molding is another method to affordably manufacture this invention. If the target face is integrated with the target arm and the mounting surface, a one-piece elastic target can be produced with a single mold. Molding is also a good way to produce a sample with various thicknesses thus allowing for thicker perimeter or target arm to increase rigidity. Another advantage of molding is the ease with which a second material such as filler, foam insert or stiffener can be added to specific portions of the target for optimized mechanical properties. To improve the tear resistance of the integrated elastomer target, the elastomer material can include clothe or fibers such as cotton, polyester, and fiberglass. Clothe or fibers are commonly included in elastomer sheets and molded products to improve tear resistance. Methods of Use To use the target of the present disclosure, an athlete can place the target mounting surface 60 against the goal post 30 as show in FIG. 4. The athlete then fastens the attachment 80 around the goal post 30 as shown in FIG. 1, securing the target into practice position. The target can be attached and removed from many different positions of the goal. The target can be attached and removed from the net. After practicing, the users can un-attach the target and conveniently store in little space for transportation. The target may be rolled for storage. Some specific embodiments of the present invention have been described herein; however, it should be understood that the embodiments are illustrative examples of the present invention and many possible specific embodiments can represent applications of the principles of this invention.
