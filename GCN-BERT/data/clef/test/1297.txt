EXAMPLE 190
3-(1-{2-[5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetyl}-piperidin-4-yl)-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 190)
190.1: 5-bromo-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-1H-pyrimidin-2-one
4 mL (30 mmol) of triethylamine and then 4.3 mL of 4-methoxybenzyl chloride are added to a solution of 5 g (30 mmol) of 5-bromo-2-hydroxypyrimidine in 150 mL of dichloromethane. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 48 h and then hydrolysed and diluted with dichloromethane. The product is extracted with dichloromethane and then with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are combined and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product obtained is taken up in 60 mL of ethyl acetate and then filtered. The solid obtained is dried with nitrogen for 2 h to give 4.9 g (46%) of 5-bromo-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-1H-pyrimidin-2-one in the form of an off-white solid.
