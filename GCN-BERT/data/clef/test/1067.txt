Example 5
DY322 (Berberine-Dopamine Hybrid).
To a solution of dopamine hydrochloride (0.92 g, 4.85 mmol) in 5 ml of methanol, 0.5 mL of triethyl amine (Et3N) was added to the stirred solution. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 h to provide dopamine free base, and then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. To a stirred solution of dopamine free base was added a solution of berberine chloride (0.45 g, 1.21 mmol) in warm ethanol (50 mL) and the reaction mixture was refluxed overnight. After cooling down, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. Solidified by EtOAc, filtrated on a Buchner apparatus, extensively rinsed with EtOAc, and ethanol and then dried under vacuum at 40° C. overnight, to give a desired product DY322 (FIG. 15) as a gray yellow powder (0.39 mg, 66%), mp: 198.4° C.
