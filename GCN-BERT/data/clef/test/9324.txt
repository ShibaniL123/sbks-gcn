No. 12/930,189, filed Dec. 30, 2010, now pending, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/335,063, filed on Dec. 30, 2009. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for treating cellulosic material with a fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme or an enzyme preparation comprising said enzyme. The enzyme is useful in various industrial applications, particularly in production of biofuels, where production of fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic material at moderate to elevated temperature ranges is advantageous. The invention further relates to fungal CBHII/Cel6A polypeptides and isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding said enzymes, a recombinant vector, host cells for producing said enzymes, enzyme compositions comprising said enzymes as well as a process for preparing such compositions. The invention relates also to various uses of said enzymes or enzyme compositions, in which enzymatic conversion of cellulosic or lignocellulosic material is desired. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Limited resources of fossil fuels and increasing amounts of CO2 released from them and causing the greenhouse phenomenon have raised a need for using biomass as a renewable and clean source of energy. One promising, alternative technology is the production of biofuels, such as ethanol, butanol or propanol from cellulosic materials. In the transportation sector biofuels are for the time being the only option, which could reduce the CO2 emissions by an order of magnitude. The ethanol can be used in existing vehicles and distribution systems and thus it does not require expensive infrastructure investments. Sugars derived from cellulosic and lignocellulosic renewable raw materials can also be used as raw materials for a variety of chemical products that can replace oil-based chemicals. Most of the carbohydrates in plants are in the form of lignocellulose, which essentially consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. In a conventional lignocellulose-to-ethanol process the lignocellulosic material is first pretreated either chemically or physically, using acid hydrolysis, steam explosion, ammonia fiber expansion, alkaline wet oxidation or ozone pretreatment, to make the cellulose fraction more accessible to enzymatic hydrolysis. The cellulose fraction is then hydrolysed to obtain sugars that can be fermented by yeast into ethanol and distilled to obtain pure ethanol. Lignin is obtained as a main co-product that may be used as a solid fuel. In this separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) process the temperature of enzymatic hydrolysis is typically higher than that of fermentation. The use of thermostable enzymes in hydrolysis offer potential benefits, such as higher reaction rates at elevated temperatures, reduction of enzyme load due to higher specific activity and life-time of enzymes, increased flexibility with respect to process configuration and better hygiene. There is continuous research for making the bioethanol production process more economical. One of the options is the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process. The principal benefits are the reduced end-product inhibition of the enzymatic hydrolysis and the reduced investment costs. The challenges are in finding favourable conditions, e.g. temperature and pH, for both the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. In the consolidated bioprocess (CBP), the amount of externally added enzymes can be significantly reduced by exploiting a fermentative organism or ethanolgen, which is capable of producing a set of lignocellulolytic enzymes. In recent years, metabolic engineering for microorganisms used in ethanol production has shown significant progress. Besides Saccharomyces cerevisisiae, microorganisms such as the bacterial species Zymomonas and Escherichia coli and yeasts such as Pichia stipitis and Kluyveromyces fragilis have been targeted for ethanol production from cellulose. In the SSF process, the inhibitor and temperature tolerance as well as the ability to utilize multiple sugars are important properties of the fermenting microorganism. Engineered yeasts have been developed that are able to ferment pentose sugars xylose and arabinose in addition to glucose. Thermophilic microbes, like Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum or Clostridium thermocellum have been engineered to ferment sugars, including xylose, to ethanol at elevated temperatures of 50° C.-60° C. (thermophilic SSF or TSSF). Such fermentative organisms have also potential as CBPs (Shaw et al. 2008). Enzymatic hydrolysis is considered the most promising technology for converting cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. However, enzymatic hydrolysis is used only to a limited amount at industrial scale, and especially when using strongly lignified material such as wood or agricultural waste the technology is not satisfactory. Efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulosic material (Badger 2002; Kurabi et al., 2005). WO2001060752 (Forskningscenter Risø, DK) describes a continuous process for converting solid lignocellulosic biomass into combustible fuel products. After pretreatment by wet oxidation or steam explosion the biomass is partially separated into cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and is then subjected to partial hydrolysis using one or more carbohydrase enzymes (EC 3.2). WO2002024882 (Iogen Bio-Products Corp., CA) pertains a method of converting cellulose to glucose by treating a pretreated lignocellulosic substrate with an enzyme mixture comprising cellulase and a modified cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) obtained by inactivating its cellulose binding domain (CBD). US2004/0005674 (Athenix Corp., US) describes novel enzyme mixtures that can be used directly on lignocellulose substrate. The synergistic enzyme mixture contains a cellulase and an auxiliary enzyme such as cellulase, xylanase, ligninase, amylase, protease, lipidase or glucuronidase, or any combination thereof. Cellulase is considered to include endoglucanase (EG), beta-glucosidase (BG) and cellobiohydrolase (CBH) enzymes. US20050164355 (Novozymes Biotech Inc., US) describes a method for degrading lignocellulosic material with one or more cellulolytic enzymes selected from EG, BG and CBH and in the presence of at least one surfactant. Additional enzymes such as hemicellulases, esterase, peroxidase, protease, laccase or mixture thereof may also be used. The best-investigated and most widely applied cellulolytic enzymes of fungal origin have been derived from Trichoderma reesei (the anamorph of Hypocrea jecorina). Cellulases from less known fungi have also been disclosed. Hong et al. (2003a and 2003b) characterize EG and CBHI of Thermoascus aurantiacus and their production in yeast. Tuohy et al.

The enzyme compositions are effective in hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic material. The genome sequence of Neurospora crassa OR74A is disclosed in Galagan et al. (2003), including a sequence of exoglucanase 2 precursor. Collins et al. (2003) disclose the coding sequence of Talaromyces emersonii CBHII/Cel6A. The market in biofuels such as renewable transportation fuels is expected to increase considerably in near future. As a result, there is a rapidly growing interest in the use of alternative feedstocks for biofuel production. Fermentation of cellulosic biomass present in plants and woods or municipal waste to ethanol and other alcohols is an attractive route to fuels that supplement fossil fuels. One barrier of production of biofuels from cellulosic and lignocellulosic biomass is the robustness of the cell walls and the presence of sugar monomers in the form of inaccessible polymers that require a great amount of processing to make the sugar monomers available to the microorganisms that are typically used to produce alcohol by fermentation. Thus, there is a continuous need for new methods as well as new enzymes and enzyme mixtures, which enhance the efficiency of the degradation of the cellulosic and lignocellulosic substrates. Particularly, enzymes and enzyme mixtures are needed which are able to attack different glycosidic linkages of the crystalline cellulosic material and thus provide almost complete hydrolysis of the varying materials to be treated. There is also a need for enzymes, which are stable at elevated process temperatures, thus enabling the use of high biomass consistency and leading to high sugar and ethanol concentrations. This approach may lead to significant savings in energy and investments costs. The high temperature also decreases the risk of contamination during hydrolysis. The present invention aims to meet at least part of these needs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The aim of the present invention is to provide new enzymes and enzyme compositions for enhancing the efficiency of cellulose hydrolysis. The cellobiohydrolases and particularly cellobiohydrolases II obtainable from Acremonium thermophilum, Melanocarpus albomyces, Chaetomium thermophilum or Talaromyces emersonii are useful in hydrolyzing and degrading cellulosic material. The enzymes are kinetically very effective over a broad range of temperatures, and although they have high activity at high temperatures, they are also very efficient at standard hydrolysis temperatures. This makes them extremely well suited for varying cellulosic substrate hydrolysis processes carried out both at conventional temperatures and at elevated temperatures. The present invention relates to a method for treating cellulosic material with a CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide or an enzyme preparation comprising said polypeptide or a fermentative microorganism producing said polypeptide, said method comprising the steps: i) production of a CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide of the invention or an enzyme preparation comprising said polypeptide or a fermentative microorganism producing said polypeptide; ii) reacting the cellulosic material with the CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide of the invention or the enzyme preparation comprising said polypeptide or the fermentative microorganism producing said polypeptide; and iii) obtaining partially or fully hydrolyzed cellulosic material.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for treating cellulosic material with a CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase polypeptide or an enzyme composition comprising said polypeptide. The invention provides also fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase polypeptides and enzyme compositions comprising said CBHII/Cel6A polypeptides, which polypeptides show broad substrate specificity, and are stable at broad pH and temperature ranges. They have good performance both at moderate and elevated temperatures. Particularly, the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase polypeptides are stable for at least 21 hours up to 70° C., preferably at a temperature range from 40° C. to 60° C. The polypeptides and enzyme compositions comprising said polypeptides are ideal in different applications requiring efficient hydrolysis of complex cellulosic or lignocellulosic materials, where cellulose is one of the major components. The polypeptides and enzyme compositions are useful, for example in hydrolysis of cellulosic material in order to produce sugar monomers from the polymeric starting material, which then can be fermented by microorganisms in the production of biofuel. Thus, the present invention provides alternative CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases for use in biofuel and other applications. The fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases can be produced in high-yielding fungal hosts with or without down-stream processing, e.g. separation of fermentation broth and mycelia is easy to perform, or in fermentative organisms. “Cellulose” or “cellulosic material” as used herein relates to any material comprising cellulose as a significant component. Cellulose is the major structural component of higher plants. It provides plant cells with high tensile strength helping them to resist mechanical stress and osmotic pressure. Cellulose is a β-1,4-glucan composed of linear chains of glucose residues joined by β-1,4-glycosidic linkages. Cellobiose is the smallest repeating unit of cellulose. Examples of cellulosic material include textile fibers derived e.g. from cotton, linen, hemp, jute and the man made cellulosic fibres as modal, viscose, lyocel. The term “cellulose” or “cellulosic material” refers also to “lignocellulose” or “lignocellulosic material” comprising cellulose as a significant component. In cell walls cellulose is packed in variously oriented sheets, which are embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose, pectin and/or polymers of phenol propanol units such as lignin to form “lignocellulosic material” or “lignocellulose”. Lignocellulose is physically hard, dense, and inaccessible. Lignocellulose containing materials include, e.g. plant materials such as wood, including hardwood and softwood, hardwood and softwoods chips, wood pulp, sawdust and forestry and wood industrial waste; herbaceous crops, agricultural biomass as cereal straws, sugar beet pulp, corn fiber, corn stover and cobbs, cereal beta-glucans, sugar cane bagasse, stems, leaves, hulls, husks, and the like; waste products as municipal solid waste, newspaper and waste office paper, waste fiber, paper sludge, milling waste of e.g. grains; dedicated energy crops (e.g., willow, poplar, swithcgrass or reed canarygrass, and the like). Cellulosic and lignocellulosic material is degraded in nature by a number of various organisms including bacteria and fungi which produce enzymes capable of hydrolyzing carbohydrate polymers. Degradation usually requires the action of many enzymes which typically act sequentially or simultaneously. The biological conversion of cellulose to glucose generally requires three major types of hydrolytic enzymes: (1) Endoglucanases (EG) which cut internal beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds mainly in the amorphous regions of cellulose; (2) Exoglucanases or cellobiohydrolases (CBH) that cut the dissaccharide cellobiose from the reducing or non-reducing end of the crystalline cellulose polymer chain; (3) Beta-1,4-glucosidases (BG) which hydrolyze the cellobiose and other short cello-oligosaccharides to glucose. Glucose and cellobiose act as end-product inhibitors of the hydrolysis reaction. “Cellulase” or “cellulolytic enzyme” is an enzyme having “cellulase activity” or “cellulolytic activity”, which means that it is capable of hydrolyzing cellulosic material. One of the most studied cellulolytic enzyme systems is that of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei which is known to exhibit at least 2 CBHs, 8 EGs and 5 BGs. “Lignocellulolytic enzymes” are enzymes having “lignocellulase activity” or “lignocellulolytic activity”, which means that they are capable of hydrolyzing lignocellulosic material, such as celluloses, hemicelluloses, or derivatives thereof into smaller saccharides. The “beta-glucans” are mixed-linkage (1→3),(1→4)-beta-D-glucans. They are common in, e.g., cereals. “Beta-glucanase” as used herein refers to enzymes that can cleave at least partly the linkages in beta-glucan. “Cellobiohydrolase” or “CBH” as used herein refers to enzymes that cleave the 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages of polymers such as cellulose from the reducing or non-reducing end and produce mainly cellobiose. They are also called exoglucanases or 1,4-beta-D-glucan cellobiohydrolases or cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidases. CBHs have a modular structure consisting of distinct domains, such as a catalytic domain and an N- or C-terminal cellulose-binding domain (CBD). There are also cellobiohydrolases in nature which lack CBD. CBHs may also have additional domains of unknown function. Different domains are usually joined together by an O-glycosylated linker or hinge peptide rich in glycine, proline, serine or threonine. By “cellobiohydrolase II” or “CBHII cellobiohydrolase” or “CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase” or “CBHII/Cel6A cellulase” or “CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide” or “CBHII/Cel6A enzyme” is in connection to this invention meant an 1, 4-β-D-glucan cellobiohydrolase enzyme classified as EC 3.2.1.91 by the Nomenclature of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB; see http://www.iubmb.org). Based on their structural similarities, cellobiohydrolases II or CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the present invention are classified into family 6 of glycosyl hydrolases (GH6) having similar amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures (Henrissat 1991; Henrissat and Bairoch 1993, 1996; Henrissat et al. 1998; see also http://www.cazy.org/fam/GH6.html). Because there is a direct relationship between sequence and folding similarities, such a classification is believed to reflect the structural features of the enzymes better than their sole substrate specificity, help to reveal the evolutionary relationships between the enzymes, and provide a convenient tool to derive mechanistic information. By the term “cellobiohydrolase activity” or “CBH activity” as used in the invention is meant hydrolytic activity acting on 1,4-beta-D-glycosidic linkages in cellulose, cellotriose, cellotetraose or in any beta-1,4-linked glucose polymer releasing primarily cellobiose from the reducing or non-reducing end of the polymeric chain. The enzymatic break-down of a glycosidic bond is a stereoselective process, in which the configuration about the anomeric centre (C1 carbon) can either be inverted or retained. Both mechanisms contain a pair of carboxylic acid residues disposed on either side of the bond to be cleaved. Inverting enzymes use a single-displacement mechanism, whereas the retaining enzymes involve a double-displacement reaction (Sinnott, 1990; Withers and Aebersold, 1995). The stereochemical course of the hydrolysis is usually determined by proton NMR, in which the α- and β-anomeric protons give different chemical shifts (Withers et al., 1986). By the term “cellobiohydrolase II activity” or “CBHII/Cel6A activity” as used in the invention is meant hydrolytic activity acting on 1,4-beta-D-glycosidic linkages in cellulose, cellotriose, cellotetraose or in any beta-1,4-linked glucose polymer releasing primarily cellobiose from the non-reducing end of the polymeric chain. The reaction mechanism of CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases is inverting. The methods for analyzing cellulase activity are well-known in the literature and are referred, e.g. by Ghose (1987), Tomme et al. (1988) and van Tilbeurgh et al. (1988). Overall cellulase activity is commonly measured as filter paper-degrading activity (FPU). Cellobiohydrolase activity may be analyzed using small, soluble cellodextrins and their chromogenic glycosides, such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glycosides. CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases can be identified based on the outcome of the hydrolysis reaction; CBHII/Cel6A enzymes cannot cleave the heterosidic linkage of small chromogenic oligosaccharides (van Tilbeurgh et al., 1988). Cellobiohydrolase activity can be analyzed also on microcrystalline cellulose such as Avicel Ph 101, as used in Example 3. The formation of soluble reducing sugars after hydrolysis may be determined by para-hydroxybenzoic-acidhydrazide (PAHBAH) method (Lever, 1972) using a cellobiose standard curve, the Somogyi-Nelson method (Somogyi, 1952), alkaline ferricyanide method (Robyt and Whelan, 1972), the 2,2′-bichinconinate method (Waffenschmidt and Jaenicke, 1987) or the dinitrosalisylic acid (DNS) method of Miller (1959). Other cellulosic substrates include, e.g. Solka floc cellulose or phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (Karlsson et al., 2001). Cellobiohydrolase II can be identified also in a Western or ELISA assay using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies raised against the purified CBHII/Cel6A protein. The term “CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase” thus means cellobiohydrolase II enzymes which are members of family 6 of glycosyl hydrolases, having both a conserved fold and stereochemistry of the hydrolysis reaction. The term “moderate temperature” or “conventional temperature” in context of the present invention means temperatures commonly used in cellulose hydrolysis and corresponding to the optimal temperatures or thermal stabilities of the enzymes used in such processes. Thus, the terms refer to temperature ranges from 30° C. to 45° C. The term “elevated temperature” or “high temperature” refers to temperature ranges from 45° C. to 70° C. In short term hydrolysis processes the enzymes may be effective even up to 80° C. Enzymes active or stable at such elevated temperature ranges are also called “thermostable” or “thermophilic” enzymes. Microorganism strains capable of producing CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase polypeptide or CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase activity can be screened on different substrates. First the chosen strains are cultivated on a suitable medium. After a sufficient amount of an interesting cellobiohydrolase has been produced, the enzyme can be isolated or purified and its properties can be more thoroughly characterized. Alternatively, genes encoding cellobiohydrolases or CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases in various organisms can be isolated and the amino acid sequence encoded by the genes can be compared with the amino acid sequences of the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases isolated and characterized in Example 1. The produced cellobiohydrolase enzymes, particularly the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzymes can be purified by using conventional methods of enzyme chemistry, such as salt preparation, ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purification can be monitored by protein determination, enzyme activity assays and by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme activity and stability of the purified enzyme at various temperature and pH values as well as the molecular mass and the isoelectric point can be determined. Alternatively, the properties of CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention may be identified by producing the enzymes in a recombinant host, and purifying and characterizing the recombinant CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases enzyme. Also, the properties of the recombinant enzyme preparation comprising the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention as one of the major enzyme components may be characterized as described in Example 3. The molecular mass of the purified CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase can be determined by mass spectrometry or on SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (1970). The molecular mass can also be predicted from the amino acid sequence of the enzyme using the pI/MW tool at ExPASy server (expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html; Gasteiger et al., 2003). The temperature dependency or thermostability of the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme can be determined in a suitable buffer at different temperatures by using e.g. Avicel cellulose as a substrate as described in Example 3 or by using other substrates and buffer systems described in the literature. Determination of the pH dependency and pH stability can be carried out in a suitable buffer at different pH values by following the activity on a cellulosic substrate. pI can be determined by isoelectric focusing on an immobilized pH gradient gel composed of polyacrylamide, starch or agarose or by estimating the pI from the amino acid sequence, for example by using the pI/MW tool at ExPASy server (expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html; Gasteiger et al., 2003). The N-terminus of the purified recombinant CBHII/Cel6A enzyme as well as internal peptides can be sequenced according to Edman degradation chemistry (Edman and Begg, 1967) or by predicting the cleavage site of the secretion signal sequence from the amino acid sequence, e.g. by using the program SignalP V3.0 (Nielsen et al., 1997; Nielsen and Krogh, 1998; Bendtsen et al., 2004) as described in Example 1 or other methods described in the literature. The term “full-length” means the form of enzyme translated from the coding DNA sequence, beginning with the ATG start codon, which encodes the first methionine in the amino acid sequence and ending at the TGA, TAG or TAA stop codon. The term “mature” means the form of enzyme which after removal of the signal sequence (secretion signal peptide or prepeptide) comprises the essential amino acids for enzymatic or catalytic activity. In filamentous fungi it is the form secreted into the culture medium as a result, for example of N-terminal processing of the signal sequence and other N-terminal processing, and post-translational glycosylation. In addition, the mature form means an enzyme which has been cleaved from its carrier protein in fusion constructions. Many of the bacterial and fungal cellobiohydrolases are produced as modular enzymes (Srisodsuk et al., 1993; Suurnäkki et al., 2000). In addition to a catalytic or core domain expressing cellulolytic activity these enzymes may comprise one or more cellulose binding domains (CBDs), also named as carbohydrate binding domains/modules (CBD/CBM), which can be located either at the N- or C-terminus of the catalytic domain. CBDs have carbohydrate-binding activity and they mediate the binding of the cellulase enzyme to crystalline cellulose but have little or no effect on cellulase hydrolytic activity of the enzyme on soluble substrates. These two domains are typically connected via a flexible and highly glycosylated linker or hinge region as is evident from the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15 and SEQ ID NO:16. “Fragment” as used in the invention means a polypeptide lacking one or more amino acid residues from the N- and/or C-terminus of the full-length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15 or SEQ ID NO:16, such as the mature form of the polypeptide or other enzymatically active portion of the polypeptide. The fragment still has the essential catalytic activity or cellobiohydrolase activity of the full-length CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase and substantially similar properties such as pH and temperature dependence and stability and substrate specificity. The polypeptides of the invention disclosed in SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID:15 and SEQ ID NO:16 naturally contain a N-terminal CBD and a linker. These native linker or CBD regions may be replaced by, e.g. a CBD from a Trichoderma or Chaetomium species. The CBHII/Cel6A enzymes of the invention may be used in the applications also without a signal sequence and/or CBD or the signal sequence and/or CBD may derive from different enzymes of the above microorganisms or different microorganism or be synthetically or recombinantly incorporated to the catalytic domain of the above enzymes. The term “identity” as used herein means the identity between two amino acid sequences compared to each other within the corresponding sequence region having approximately the same amount of amino acids. For example, the identity of a full-length or a mature sequence of the two amino acid sequences may be compared. Also, the identity of a full-length or a mature sequence lacking the N-terminal CBD of the two amino acid sequences may be compared. Thus, comparison of e.g. the CBHII/Cel6A sequences including CBD and/or signal sequences with sequences lacking those elements is not within the context of the invention. The identity of the full-length sequences may be measured by using, for example ClustalW alignment (e.g. in www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/Clustalw) with a matrix as follows: BLOSUM, Gap open:10, Gap extension: 0.5, or using a program of Clone Manager (version 9) (Scientific and Educational Software, Cary, USA), including the functions “Compare Two Sequences/Global/Compare sequences as amino acids/BLOSUM62 scoring matrix as described in Example 1. The amino acid sequences of the two molecules to be compared may differ in one or more positions, which however do not alter the biological function or structure of the molecules. Such “variants” may occur naturally because of different host organisms or mutations in the amino acid sequence, e.g. as an allelic variant within the same strain, species or genus, or they may be achieved by specific mutagenesis. They may comprise amino acid substitutions, deletions, combinations or insertions of one or more positions in the amino acid sequence, but they still function in a substantially similar manner to the enzymes defined in SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15 or SEQ ID NO:16, i.e. they comprise a variant having cellulolytic activity. The present invention relates to a method for treating cellulosic material, including also lignocellulosic material with a CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide or an enzyme composition comprising said polypeptide or as in a consolidated bioprocess, the cellulosic material may be treated with a fermentative microorganism producing said polypeptide, wherein the CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide exhibits cellobiohydrolase activity and comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 76% identity to the full-length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 12, at least 76% identity to the full-length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:14, at least 95% identity to the full-length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:15, or at least 91% identity to the full-length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:16, or a fragment or variant thereof having similar properties. Said enzyme is capable in hydrolyzing cellulosic material, including lignocellulose at moderate to elevated temperatures. Said method comprises the following steps: i) production of a CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide of the invention or an enzyme composition comprising said polypeptide or a fermentative microorganism producing said polypeptide; ii) reacting the cellulosic material with the CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide of the invention or the enzyme composition comprising said polypeptide or the fermentative microorganism producing said polypeptide; and iii) obtaining partially or fully hydrolyzed cellulosic material, including hydrolyzed lignocellulosic material. CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzymes useful for treating or hydrolyzing cellulosic material are “obtainable from” any organism including plants. Preferably CBHII/Cel6A enzymes originate from microorganisms, e.g. bacteria or fungi. The bacteria may be, for example from a genus selected from Bacillus, Azospirillum, Streptomyces and Pseudomonas. More preferably the enzyme originates from fungi (including filamentous fungi and yeasts), for example from a genus selected from the group consisting of yeasts Schizosaccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Saccharomyces, Candida and Yarrowia or filamentous fungi Achaetomium, Acremonium, Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Botrytis, Chaetomium, Chrysosporium, Cryptococcus, Collybia, Fomes, Fusarium, Humicola, Hypocrea, Lentinus, Magnaporthea, Melanocarpus, Mucor, Myceliophthora, Myriococcum, Neocallimastix, Neurospora, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Phanerochaete, Phlebia, Pleurotus, Podospora, Polyporus, Pycnoporus, Rhizoctonia, Schizophyllum, Scytalidium, Talaromyces, Thermoascus, Thielavia, Trametes and Trichoderma. Preferably the CBHII/Cel6A enzymes derive from Acremonium thermophilum, Melanocarpus albomyces, Chaetomium thermophilum or Talaromyces emersonii. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the enzymes are obtainable from a filamentous fungal strain ALKO4245 deposited as CBS 116240 and presently classified as Acremonium thermophilium, Melanocarpus albomyces strain ALKO4237 deposited as CBS 685.95, Talaromyces emersonii strain DSM 2432 (in applicant's culture collection under the number RF8069) or Chaetomium thermophilum strain ALKO4265 deposited as CBS 730.95. The CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the present invention are marked as At_ALKO4245_Cel6A, Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A, Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A and Te_RF8069_Cel6A, being the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases originating from the strains Acremonium thermophilum CBS 116240, Melanocarpus albomyces CBS 685.95, Chaetomium thermophilum CBS 730.95 or Talaromyces emersonii DSM 2432 and members of family 6 of glycoside hydrolases.

The identities of the two enzymes are compared within the corresponding sequence regions, i.e. within the full-length region of the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase. The fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention are active or stable over a broad pH range of at least pH 3 to pH 10 and more preferably at a pH range of at least pH 3 to pH 7 when assayed at 50° C. for 21 hours using Avicel cellulose as a substrate, as described in Example 3. In particular, the At_ALKO4245_Cel6A is active between pH 3 and pH 7, preferably between pH 4 and pH 6, and more preferably between pH 4 and pH 5. The maximum activity of At_ALKO4245_Cel6A is at pH 5 when assayed at 50° C. for 21 hours using Avicel cellulose as a substrate. The Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A is active at a pH range between pH 3 and pH 10, preferably between pH 4 and pH 8, more preferably between pH 4 and pH 7, still more preferably between pH 4 and pH 6, and even more preferably between pH 4 and pH 5. The maximum activity of Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A is at pH 4 when assayed at 50° C. for 21 hours using Avicel cellulose as a substrate. The Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A is active at a pH range between pH 3 and pH 10, preferably between pH 3 and pH 8, more preferably between pH 3 and pH 7, still more preferably between pH 4 and pH 7, and even more preferably between pH 4 and pH 6. The maximum activity of Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A is at pH 5 when assayed at 50° C. for 21 hours using Avicel cellulose as a substrate. The Te_RF8089_Cel6A is active at a pH range between pH 3 and pH 7, preferably between pH 3 and pH 6, and more preferably between pH 4 and pH 6. The maximum activity of Te_RF8089_Cel6A is at pH 4 when assayed at 50° C. for 21 hours using Avicel cellulose as a substrate. The enzymes of the invention are effective in degrading cellulosic or lignocellulosic material at a broad temperature range. The CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention are active or stable for up to 21 hours in a temperature range between 40° C. and 70° C. when assayed at the optimum pH of the enzymes using Avicel cellulose as a substrate, as described in Example 3. The At_ALKO4245_Cel6A cellobiohydrolase is active between 40° C. and 70° C., preferably between 40° C. and 60° C., more preferably between 50° C. and 60° C. At optimal pH the maximum activity of At_ALKO4245_Cel6A is at 60° C. when using a 21 hours incubation time and Avicel cellulose as a substrate. The Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A cellobiohydrolase is active in a temperature range between 40° C. and 60° C. The enzyme shows maximum activity at 50° C. when incubated for 21 hours at the optimal pH using Avicel cellulose as a substrate. The Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A cellobiohydrolase is active in a temperature range between 40° C. and 70° C., preferably in the range of 50° C. to 60° C. At the optimal pH the maximum activity is at 60° C. when using a 21 hours incubation time and Avicel cellulose as a substrate. The Te_RF8089_Cel6A cellobiohydrolase is active between 40° C. and 70° C., preferably between 40° C. and 60° C., more preferably between 50° C. and 60° C. The maximum activity is at 60° C. when incubated for 21 hours at the optimal pH using Avicel cellulose as a substrate. The cellulolytic enzymes presently in use in hydrolysis of cellulosic material and production of fermentable sugars for, e.g. bioethanol applications derive mainly from the well-studied microorganisms, such as the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei (e.g. the Accellerase® product line, Genencor Int., Inc., US). The cellulolytic enzymes are conventionally used at temperatures in the range of 30° C. to 45° C. The CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the present invention are efficient at these temperatures too, but in addition they work extremely well even at temperatures up to 70° C., such as between 40° C. and 70° C., e.g. between 40° C. and 70° C. or between 40° C. and 60° C. or between 50° C. and 60° C., as shown in Example 3. For short hydrolysis times enzyme compositions may be functional up to 80° C. For total hydrolysis longer incubation times are required and, therefore, lower temperatures are normally used. This makes the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention extremely well suited for varying cellulosic substrate hydrolysis processes carried out both at conventional or moderate temperatures and at elevated temperatures. In Examples 4 and 5, experiments performed on various cellulosic materials, such as hardwood and corn cobbs are described. From FIG. 4 it is evident that the performance of the enzyme mixtures supplemented with the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases At_ALKO4245_Cel6A, Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A or Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A in hydrolysis of steam exploded hardwood is by far better than the performance of the enzyme mixtures without such supplementation. In the experiments performed at 55° C. (FIG. 4A), the amount of sugars released from the hardwood substrate was found to increase 12%, 14% and 26% by supplementing with Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A, Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A or At_ALKO4245_Cel6A enzymes in the MIXTURE 2, respectively. Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245 enzyme was found to be best-performing CBHII/Cel6A herein studied. At_ALKO4245_Cel6A shows increased hydrolysis also at 37° C. added either in the state-of-the-art Trichoderma mixture (MIXTURE T. REESEI ENZYMES) (FIG. 4B) or in the commercial product (MIXTURE ACC) (FIG. 4C). Similar results were obtained also on steam exploded corn cobbs (FIG. 5). The thermophilic enzyme MIXTURE 2 was supplemented with the At_ALKO4245_Cel6A enzyme of the invention. The combined amount of glucose and xylose after 72 hours hydrolysis was remarkably higher than without such supplementation. According to one preferred embodiment of the invention the method for treating cellulosic and lignocellulosic material, such as the lignocellulosic material including hemicellulose, pectin and lignin involves use of one or more of the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention as an “enzyme composition” or “enzyme preparation” comprising at least one further enzyme capable of hydrolyzing said material. The additional enzymes may be selected from a group of cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, beta-glucosidase, beta-glucanase, xyloglucanase, xylanase, beta-xylosidase, mannanase, beta-mannosidase, α-glucuronidase, acetyl xylan esterase, α-arabinofuranosidase, α-galactosidase, pectinase, involving endo- and exo-α-L-arabinases, α-galactosidase, endo- and exo-galactoronase, endopectinlyase, pectinesterase, pectate lyase, phenol esterase, ligninase involving lignin peroxidase, manganese-dependent peroxidase, H2O2-generating enzyme and laccase with or without a mediator. The enzyme preparation or composition comprises at least one of the enzymes defined above. It may contain the enzymes in at least partially purified and isolated form. It may even essentially consist of the desired enzyme or enzymes. Alternatively the preparation may be a spent culture medium or filtrate containing one or more of the desired enzymes. Preferably the enzyme preparation is spent culture medium. “Spent culture medium” refers to the culture medium of the host comprising the produced enzymes. Preferably the host cells are separated from said medium after the production. The enzyme preparation or composition may also be a “whole culture broth” obtained, optionally after killing the production host(s) or microorganism(s) without any further down-stream processing or purification of the desired cellulolytic enzyme(s). In the “consolidated bioprocess” the enzyme composition or at least some of the enzymes of the enzyme composition may be produced by the fermentative microorganism. “Isolated polypeptide” in the present context may simply mean that the cells and cell debris have been removed from the culture medium containing the polypeptide. Conveniently the polypeptides are isolated, e.g. by adding anionic and/or cationic polymers to the spent culture medium to enhance precipitation of cells, cell debris and some enzymes that have unwanted side activities. The medium is then filtrated using an inorganic filtering agent and a filter to remove the precipitants formed. After this the filtrate is further processed using a semi-permeable membrane to remove excess of salts, sugars and metabolic products. In addition to the enzymatic activity, the preparation may contain additives, such as mediators, stabilizers, buffers, preservatives, surfactants and/or culture medium components. Preferred additives are such, which are commonly used in enzyme preparations intended for a particular application. The enzyme preparation may be in the form of liquid, powder or granulate. According to one embodiment of the invention the enzyme preparation comprises a mixture of CBHs, EGs and BGs, optionally together with hemicellulose degrading enzymes in combination with the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention. Different enzyme mixtures and combinations may be used to suit different substrate materials and process conditions. For example if the degradation process is to be carried out at a high temperature, thermostable enzymes are chosen. “Hemicellulose” is a heterogeneous group of carbohydrate polymers containing mainly different glucans, xylans and mannans. Hemicellulose consists of a linear backbone with β-1,4-linked residues substituted with short side chains usually containing acetyl acid, 4-O-glucuronic acid, L-arabinose and galactosyl groups. Hemicellulose may be chemically cross-linked to lignin and cellulose. “Xylan degrading enzymes” or “xylanases” include both exohydrolytic and endohydrolytic enzymes such as endo-1,4-beta-D-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) or exo-1,4-beta-D-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37), which break down hemicellulose to xylose. Gluco- and galactomannans are hydrolyzed by endo-1,4-beta-mannanases (EC3.2.1.78) and beta-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25) to yield beta-D-mannose. Enzymes capable of removing side chain substituents include α-glucuronidases, acetyl xylan esterases, α-arabinofuranosidases and α-galactosidases which act cooperatively with the backbone degrading enzymes (Biely et al. 1997; Sundberg and Poutanen, 1991; Stålbrand et al., 1995). Enzymes involved in degradation of the “pectin” involve endo- and exo-α-L-arabinases and α-galactosidase, endo- and exo-galactoronases, endopectinlyases and pectinesterases (Del Cañizo et al., 1994). “Lignin” is a complex cross-linked polymer of variously substituted p-hydroxyphenylpropane units. Its hydrolysis involves lignin peroxidases, phenol esterases, manganese-dependent peroxidases, H2O2-generating enzymes and laccases (Cullen and Kersten, 2004). The enzymes of the enzyme composition may be added to the lignocellulosic material either simultaneously or sequentially. According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the method is applicable on various cellulose, lignocellulose and beta-glucan containing materials, such as plant materials, e.g. wood, including hardwood and softwood, hardwood and softwoods chips, wood pulp, sawdust and forestry and wood industrial waste; herbaceous crops, agricultural biomass as cereal straws, sugar beet pulp, corn fiber, corn stover and cobbs, cereal beta-glucans, sugar cane bagasse, stems, leaves, hulls, husks, and the like; waste products as municipal solid waste, newspaper and waste office paper, waste fiber, paper sludge, milling waste of e.g. grains; dedicated energy crops (e.g., willow, poplar, switchgrass or reed canarygrass, and the like). According to one embodiment of the invention, the method is applicable for production of biofuels, such as ethanol, propanol and butanol and alike from cellulosic material. Within the context of the invention is a method, wherein the CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide polypeptide used in the hydrolysis of the cellulosic material derives from Acremonium thermophilum CBS 116240 strain and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:12 or at least 78%, 80%, 82%, 84%, 86%, 88%, 90%, 92%, 94%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identity with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:12, or a fragment or variant thereof having cellobiohydrolase activity. The present invention relates also to a fungal CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide having cellobiohydrolase activity and comprising an amino acid sequence having at least 76% identity to the full-length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 12, at least 76% identity to the full-length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:14, at least 95% identity to the full-length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:15, or at least 91% identity to the full-length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:16, or a fragment or variant thereof having similar properties. The CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide may be obtainable from the filamentous fungal genus Acremonium, Melanocarpus, Chaetomium or Talaromyces. Preferable species include Acremonium thermophilum, Melanocarpus albomyces, Chaetomium thermophilum or Talaromyces emersonii. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the enzymes are obtainable from a filamentous fungal strain ALKO4245 deposited as CBS 116240 presently classified as Acremonium thermophilium, Melanocarpus albomyces strain ALKO4237 deposited as CBS 685.95, Chaetomium thermophilum strain ALKO4265 deposited as CBS 730.95 or Talaromyces emersonii strain DSM 2432 (in the applicant's culture collection under number RF8069). According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme is a polypeptide having cellobiohydrolase activity and comprising the enzyme of At_ALKO4245_Cel6A having the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:12. Another preferred embodiment of the invention is a fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme having cellobiohydrolase activity and comprising the enzyme of Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A with the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:14. A further preferred embodiment of the invention is a fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme having cellobiohydrolase activity and comprising the enzyme of Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A with the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:15. Still further preferred embodiment of the invention is a fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme having cellobiohydrolase activity and comprising the enzyme of Te_RF8069_Cel6A with the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:16. According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme is capable in hydrolyzing cellulosic material at moderate to elevated temperatures. The CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention are active or stable even at temperatures up to 70° C., such as between 40° C. and 70° C., e.g. between 40° C. and 60° C. or between 50° C. and 60° C., when assayed at the optimum pH of the enzymes using Avicel Ph101 cellulose as a substrate, as described in Example 3. For short hydrolysis times enzyme compositions may be functional up to 80° C. For total hydrolysis longer incubation times are required and, therefore, lower temperatures are normally used. This makes the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention extremely well suited for varying cellulosic substrate hydrolysis processes carried out both at conventional or moderate temperatures and at elevated temperatures requiring thermostability of the enzymes. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the fungal CBHII/Cel6A is encoded by an isolated nucleic acid molecule which comprises a polynucleotide sequence, which encodes a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence characterized in SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15 or SEQ ID NO:16. Thus, within the scope of the invention is CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme or polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of the full-length form of the At_ALKO4245_Cel6A enzyme characterized in SEQ ID NO: 12, Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A enzyme characterized in SEQ ID NO:14, Ct_ALKO4265 characterized in SEQ ID NO:15 or Te_RF8069_Cel6A characterized in SEQ ID NO:16. Further, within the scope of the present invention are polypeptides encoded by nucleic acid molecules encoding a CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide having cellobiohydrolase activity and at least 76% identity to the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:12, at least 76% identity to the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:14, at least 95% identity to the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:15 or at least 91% to the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:16. The identities of the two enzymes are compared within the corresponding sequence regions, i.e. within the full-length region of the CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide. Within the scope of the invention is a polypeptide sequence, which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule coding for a fragment of the polypeptide, which polypeptide fragment lacks one or more amino acid residues from the N- and/or C-terminus of the full-length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15 or SEQ ID NO:16. The fragment still has the essential catalytic activity or cellobiohydrolase activity of the full-length CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase and substantially similar properties such as pH and temperature dependence and substrate specificity. The fragment may, for example be an enzyme which lacks the secretion signal sequence or carbohydrate binding domain or CBD. Also included are natural or synthetic variants of the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases, which have properties similar to the polypeptides defined in SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15 or SEQ ID NO:16. The variation may result from deletion, substitution, insertion, addition or combination of one or more positions in the amino acid sequence. One preferred embodiment of the invention is a CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase which is encoded by an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a polynucleotide sequence included in SEQ ID NO:11, SEQ ID NO:13, SEQ ID NO:9 or SEQ ID NO:10 or a subsequence thereof. Within the context of the invention is a CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase, which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide sequence hybridizing under stringent conditions to a polynucleotide sequence or a subsequence thereof included in SEQ ID NO:11, SEQ ID NO:13, SEQ ID NO:9 or SEQ ID NO:10. Also, a preferred embodiment is a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide sequence hybridizing with a probe prepared using PCR, such as the PCR fragment included in SEQ ID NO:7 or SEQ ID NO:8. Standard molecular biology methods can be used in isolation of cDNA or a genomic DNA of the host organism, e.g. the methods described in the molecular biology handbooks, such as Sambrook and Russell, 2001. The cDNA or a genomic gene encoding the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention may be isolated using DNA probes, which have been prepared based on the amino acid sequence of N-terminal or tryptic peptides of the purified CBHII/Cel6A enzyme. Alternatively, the probe may be designed based on the known nucleotide or amino acid sequences of homologous cellobiohydrolases. The CBHII/Cel6A clones may also be screened based on activity on plates containing a specific substrate for the enzyme or by using antibodies specific for a CBHII/Ce6A cellobiohydrolase. Hybridization with a DNA probe, such as for example SEQ ID NO:7 consisting of more than 100-200 nucleotides, is usually performed at “high stringency” conditions, i.e. hybridization at a temperature, which is 20-25° C. below the calculated melting temperature (Tm) of a perfect hybrid, the Tm calculated according to Bolton and McCarthy (1962) and posthybridization washes in low salt concentration. Usually prehybridization and hybridization are performed at least at 65° C. in 6×SSC (or 6×SSPE), 5×Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured, fragmented salmon sperm DNA. Addition of 50% formamide lowers the prehybridization and hybridization temperatures to 42° C. High stringency washes are performed in low salt concentration, e.g. in 2×SSC-0.1% SDS (w/v) at RT, and finally in 0.1×SSC-0.1% SDS (w/v) at least at 65° C., e.g. at 68° C. In the present invention the At_ALKO4245_cel6A, Ma_ALKO4237_cel6A, Ct_ALKO4265_cel6A and Te_RF8069_cel6A genes were isolated with a probe prepared by PCR using stringent hybridization conditions as described in Example 1. Genomic cbh2/cel6A genes were isolated by using oligonucleotide primers designed based on the published nucleotide sequences or using degenerate oligonucleotide primers planned based on the alignment of the previously known amino acid sequences of CBHII/Cel6A proteins. According to one preferred embodiment of the invention the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme is encoded by an isolated nucleic acid molecule, which comprises the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:11 encoding the full-length form of the At_ALKO4245_Cel6A enzyme of SEQ ID NO:12.

Construction of said recombinant expression vector and use of said vector is described in more detail in Example 2. Suitable hosts for production of the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase are homologous or heterologous hosts, such as the microbial hosts including bacteria, yeasts and fungi. Filamentous fungi, such as Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Humicola, Chrysosporium, Neurospora, Rhizopus, Penicillium and Mortierella, are preferred production hosts due to the ease of down-stream processing and recovery of the enzyme product. Suitable hosts include species such as T. reesei, A. niger, A oryzae, A. sojae, A. awamori or A. japonicus type of strains, F. venenatum or F. oxysporum, H. insolens or H. lanuginosa, N. crassa and C. lucknowense, some of which are listed as enzyme production host organisms in e.g. AMFEP 2007 list of commercial enzymes (www.amfep.org/list.html). More preferably, the enzyme is produced in a filamentous fungal host of the genus Trichoderma or Aspergillus, such as T. reesei, or A. niger, A. oryzae or A. awamori. According the most preferred embodiment of the invention the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme is produced in T. reesei.

The nucleic acid molecule of the invention may be RNA or DNA, wherein the DNA may constitute of the genomic DNA or cDNA. Standard molecular biology methods can be used in isolation and enzyme treatments of the polynucleotide sequence encoding the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention, including isolation of genomic and plasmid DNA, digestion of DNA to produce DNA fragments, sequencing, E. coli transformations etc. The basic methods are described in the standard molecular biology handbooks, e.g. Sambrook and Russell, 2001.

Briefly, the 1032 bp PCR fragment (SEQ ID NO:7) and the 831 bp PCR fragment (SEQ ID NO:8) obtained by using the sequences of the degenerate oligonucleotide primers (SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:2) were used to isolate the At_ALKO4245_cel6A gene from Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245 and the Ma_ALKO4237_cel6A gene from Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237 in pCR®4Blunt-TOPO® vector.

The translated full-length polypeptide starts usually with methionine. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a coding sequence of a polynucleotide sequence included in plasmid pALK2582 deposited in Escherichia coli RF8175 under accession number DSM 22946, plasmid pALK2581 deposited in Escherichia coli RF8174 under accession number DSM 22945, plasmid pALK2904 deposited in Escherichia coli RF8214 under accession number DSM 22947, or plasmid pALK3006 deposited in Escherichia coli RF8333 under accession number DSM 23185, said polynucleotide sequences encoding the At_ALKO4245_Cel6A, Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A, Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A and Te_RF8069_Cel6A cellobiohydrolases, respectively. The nucleic acid molecule of the invention may also be an analogue of the nucleotide sequence characterized above. The “degeneracy” means analogues of the nucleotide sequence, which differ in one or more nucleotides or codons, but which encode the recombinant CBHII/Cel6A of the invention. The nucleic acid molecule may also be a nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide sequence hybridizing under stringent conditions to a polynucleotide sequence contained in plasmids pALK2582, pALK2581, pALK2904 or pALK3006 deposited in E. coli under the accession numbers DSM 22946, DSM 22945, DSM 22947 or DSM 23185 or a subsequence thereof, and encoding a polypeptide having cellobiohydrolase activity and an amino acid sequence which within the corresponding sequence region shows at least 76% identity to the full-length amino acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO:12, at least 76% identity to the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:14, at least 95% identity to the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:15 or at least 91% to the full-length amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:16. The hybridizing DNA may originate from a fungus belonging to genus Acremonium, Melanocarpus, Chaetomium or Talaromyces or it may originate from other fungal species. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase enzyme is encoded by an isolated nucleic acid molecule, which comprises the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:11 encoding the full-length form of the At_ALKO4245_Cel6A enzyme of SEQ ID NO:12. The present invention relates also to a recombinant expression vector or recombinant expression construct, which can be used to propagate or express the nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide sequence encoding the chosen CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase in a suitable prokaryotic or eukaryotic host. The recombinant expression vector comprises DNA or nucleic acid sequences which facilitate or direct expression and secretion of the CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide encoding sequence or gene in a suitable host, such as promoters, enhancers, terminators (including transcription and translation termination signals) and signal sequences operably linked the polynucleotide sequence encoding said polypeptide. The expression vector may further comprise marker genes for selection of the transformant strains or the selection marker may be introduced to the host in another vector construct by co-transformation. Said regulatory sequences may be homologous or heterologous to the production organism or they may originate from the organism, from which the gene encoding the CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide is isolated. Examples of promoters for expressing the CBHII/Cel6A of the invention in filamentous fungal hosts are the promoters of A. oryzae TAKA amylase, alkaline protease ALP and triose phosphate isomerase, Rhizopus miehei lipase, Aspergillus niger or A. awamori glucoamylase (glaA), Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease, Chrysosporium lucknowense cellobiohydrolase 1 promoter, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I (Cel7A) etc. In yeast, for example promoters of S. cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1), galactokinase (GAL1), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2) and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase can be used to provide expression. Examples of promoter sequences for directing the transcription of the CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide of the invention in a bacterial host are the promoter of lac operon of Escherichia coli, the Streptomyces coelicolor agarase dagA promoter, the promoter of the B. licheniformis alpha-amylase gene (amyL), the promoter of the B. stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene (amyM), the promoters of the B. subtilis xylA and xylB genes, etc. Suitable terminators include those of the above mentioned genes or any other characterized terminator sequences. Suitable transformation or selection markers include those which complement a defect in or adds a new feature, e.g. enzyme activity to the host, for example the dal genes from B. subtilis or B. licheniformis or Aspergillus amdS and niaD. The selection may be based also on a marker conferring antibiotic resistance, such as ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, phleomycin or hygromycin resistance. Extracellular production of the CBHII/Cel6A of the invention is preferable. Thus, the recombinant vector comprises sequences facilitating secretion in the selected host. The signal sequence of the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention or the presequence or prepeptide may be included in the recombinant expression vector or the natural signal sequence may be replaced with another signal sequence capable of facilitating expression in the selected host. Thus, the chosen signal sequence may be homologous or heterologous to the expression host. Examples of suitable signal sequences are those of the fungal or yeast organisms, e.g. signal sequences from well expressed genes. Such signal sequences are well known from the literature. The recombinant vector may further comprise sequences facilitating integration of the vector into the host chromosomal DNA to obtain stable expression. The vector may also be a fusion construct and comprise sequences encoding a carrier polypeptide, which is genetically fused with the same coding sequence as the coding sequence of the protein of interest and which improves secretion of the polypeptide in a heterologous host organism or which facilitates the protein purification after production. Such carriers include, e.g. the proteins produced in high amounts by the native host, such as the cellulases of T. reesei or glucoamylases of Aspergillus species. The carrier polypeptide may also be an intact domain of the secretable protein, such as the CBD. The carrier protein and the protein of interest may remain as a fusion after the secretion, or are separated by a proteolytic processing during the protein export process in the host, or are separated chemically or biochemically after the secretion into the supernatant. The At_ALKO4245_Cel6A, Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A, Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A and Te_RF8069_Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention were expressed with their own signal sequence from the Trichoderma reesei cbh1 (cel7A) promoter as described in Example 2. The expression construct used to transform the T. reesei host included also cbh1 terminator and amdS marker for selecting the transformants from the untrasformed cells. The present invention relates also to host cells comprising the recombinant expression vector as described above. Suitable hosts for production of the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase are homologous or heterologous hosts, such as the microbial hosts including bacteria, yeasts and fungi. Production systems in plant or mammalian cells are also possible. Filamentous fungi, such Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Humicola, Chrysosporium, Neurospora, Rhizopus, Penicillium and Mortierella, are preferred production hosts due to the ease of down-stream processing and recovery of the enzyme product. Suitable expression and production host systems are for example the production system developed for the filamentous fungus host Trichoderma reesei (EP 244234), or Aspergillus production systems, such as A. oryzae or A. niger (WO 9708325, U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,745, U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,418), A. awamori, A. sojae and A. japonicus-type strains, or the production system developed for Fusarium, such as F. oxysporum (Malardier et al., 1989) or F. venenatum, and for Neurospora crassa, Rhizopus miehei, Mortierella alpinis, H. lanuginosa or H. insolens or for Chrysosporium lucknowense (U.S. Pat. No. 6,573,086). Suitable production systems developed for yeasts are systems developed for Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces or Pichia pastoris. Suitable production systems developed for bacteria are a production system developed for Bacillus, for example for B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. amyloliquefaciens, for E. coli, or for the actinomycete Streptomyces. Preferably the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention is produced in a filamentous fungal host of the genus Trichoderma or Aspergillus, such as T. reesei, or A. niger, A. oryzae, A. sojae, A. awamori or A. japonicus-type strains. According the most preferred embodiment of the invention the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase is produced in T. reesei. The production host cell may be homologous or heterologous to the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention. Preferably the recombinant host is modified to express and secrete cellulolytic enzymes as its main activity or one of its main activities. This can be done by deleting major homologous secreted genes e.g. the four major cellulases of Trichoderma and by targeting heterologous genes to a locus that has been modified to ensure high expression and production levels. For example, the host may be free of homogenous cellobiohydrolases due to removal of said cellobiohydrolases either by inactivation or removal of one or more host cellobiohydrolases, e.g. by deletion of the gene(s) encoding such homogenous or homologous cellobiohydrolase(s). The present invention relates also to a process for producing a CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide having cellobiohydrolase activity, said process comprising the steps of culturing the natural or recombinant host cell carrying the recombinant expression vector for a CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention under suitable conditions and optionally isolating said enzyme. The production medium may be a medium suitable for growing the host organism and containing inducers for efficient expression. Suitable media are well-known from the literature. The invention relates to a polypeptide having cellobiohydrolase activity, said polypeptide being encoded by the nucleic acid molecule of the invention and which is obtainable by the process described above. The invention further relates to a process for obtaining an enzyme preparation comprising a CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide, which has cellobiohydrolase activity, said process comprising the steps of culturing a host cell carrying the expression vector of the invention and preparing the whole culture broth, or separating the cells from the spent culture medium and obtaining the supernatant having cellobiohydrolase activity. The present invention relates also to an enzyme preparation, which comprises the CBHII/Cel6A enzyme characterized above. The enzyme preparation or composition has cellobiohydrolase activity and is obtainable by the process according to the invention. Within the invention is an enzyme preparation which comprises the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention. Said enzyme preparation may further comprise different types of enzymes in addition to the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of this invention, for example another cellulase including a cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase and beta-glucosidase, beta-glucanase, an amylase, a lipase, cutinase, a protease, xylanase, beta-xylosidase, mannanase, beta-mannosidase, α-glucuronidase, acetyl xylan esterase, α-arabinofuranosidase, α-galactosidase, pectinase, involving endo- and exo-α-L-arabinases, α-galactosidase, endo- and exo-galactoronase, xyloglucanase, endopectinlyase, pectate lyase, and pectinesterase, phenol esterase, ligninase involving lignin peroxidase, manganese-dependent peroxidase, H2O2-generating enzyme and/or an oxidase such as a laccase or peroxidase with or without a mediator. These enzymes are expected to enhance the performance of the CBHII/Cel6A enzyme of the invention by removing the carbohydrates, proteins and oils or fats present in the material to be handled. Said enzymes may be natural or recombinant enzymes produced by the host strain or may be added to the culture supernatant after the production process. The enzyme compositions or enzyme preparations may contain any combination of these enzymes. The CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases may also be used in combination to commercially available enzyme preparations. The enzymes needed for the hydrolysis of the cellulosic material according to the invention may be added in an enzymatically effective amount either simultaneously, e.g. in the form of an enzyme mixture, or sequentially, or as a part of the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process or they may be produced by the fermentative microorganism in the consolidated bioprocess. The enzyme preparation or composition may contain the enzymes in at least partially purified and isolated form. It may even essentially consist of the desired enzyme or enzymes. Alternatively the preparation may be a whole culture broth or spent culture medium or filtrate containing one or more desired enzymes. In a consolidated bioprocess the enzymes may be produced by the fermentative microorganism used in the process. In addition to the enzymatic activity, the preparation may contain additives, such as mediators, stabilizers, buffers, preservatives, surfactants and/or culture medium components. Preferred additives are such, which are commonly used in enzyme preparations intended for a particular application. Surfactants are useful in emulsifying grease and wetting surfaces. The surfactant may be a non-ionic including semi-polar and/or anionic and/or cationic and/or zwitterionic. Buffers may be added to the enzyme preparation to modify pH or affect performance or stability of other ingredients. Suitable stabilizers include polyols such as propylene glycol or glycerol, a sugar or sugar alcohol, lactic acid, boric acid, or boric acid derivatives, peptides, etc. Bleaching agent is used to oxidize and degrade organic compounds. Examples of suitable chemical bleaching systems are H2O2 sources, such as perborate or percarbonate with or without peracid-forming bleach activators such as tetraacetylethylenediamine, or alternatively peroxyacids, e.g. amide, imide or sulfone type. Chemical oxidizers may be replaced partially or completely by using oxidizing enzymes, such as laccases or peroxidases. Many laccases do not function effectively in the absence of mediators. Builders or complexing agents include substances, such as zeolite, diphosphate, triphosphate, carbonate, citrate, etc. The enzyme preparation may further comprise one or more polymers, such as carboxymethylcellulose, poly(ethylene glycol), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), etc. Also, softeners, caustics, preservatives for preventing spoilage of other ingredients, abrasives and substances modifying the foaming and viscosity properties can be added. According to one preferred embodiment of the invention said enzyme preparation is in the form of spent culture medium, liquid, powder or granulate. Preferably the enzyme preparation is spent culture medium. The present invention relates also to various uses of the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention, in which hydrolysis or modification of cellulosic material is desired. Such uses include any application, in which cellulolytic enzymes are conventionally used, such as in fuel, textile, detergent, pulp and paper, food, feed or beverage industry. Addition of the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention to an enzyme composition comprising other cellulose degrading enzymes such as cellobiohydrolase I, endoglucanases and beta-glucosidases, greatly enhances the hydrolysis and leads to almost total hydrolysis of the polymeric cellulose backbone to glucose monomers. The major product of CBHII/Cel6A action is cellobiose composed of two glucose units. One preferred embodiment is the use of the method of the invention in applications requiring stability/performance of the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase at moderate/conventional or elevated temperatures, i.e. requiring thermophilic or thermostable enzymes. Elevated temperatures are known to enhance the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose present in cellulosic or lignocellulosic materials, thus reducing the total amount of enzymes needed in hydrolysis or reducing the required hydrolysis time. Also, since at elevated temperatures the viscosity of the lignocellulosic substrate is decreased, thermostable enzymes make it possible to work at higher solid loadings and save in investment costs. Another preferred embodiment is the use of the CBHII/Cel6A polypeptide of the invention or the enzyme preparation comprising said polypeptide in hydrolyzing cellulosic material for the production of biofuel comprising ethanol, propanol, butanol and alike. In production of biofuel the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention are like other cellulolytic enzymes especially suitable for producing glucose monomers from the polymeric cellulosic material which may then be fermented by yeast strains into ethanol, and used as fuel. The lignocellulosic material may be pretreated before the enzymatic hydrolysis to disrupt the fiber structure of cellulosic substrates and make the cellulose fraction more accessible to the cellulolytic enzymes. Current pretreatments include mechanical, chemical or thermal processes and combinations thereof. The material may for example be pretreated by steam explosion or acid hydrolysis. The saccharification process, i.e. production of sugar monomers, and fermentation by yeast strains may be performed separately or simultaneously in the same reactor. The CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase of the invention has a great advantage to the commercial enzymes presently for sale in that it is stable also at elevated temperatures, i.e. is thermostable. Hydrolysis of cellulosic or lignocellulosic materials is known to enhance at elevated temperatures and yield sugar monomers more efficiently. The use of the CBHII/Cel6A polypeptides of the invention enables the use of high biomass consistency and lead to high sugar and ethanol concentrations. This approach may lead to significant savings in energy and investments costs. The high temperature also decreases the risk of contamination during hydrolysis. The sugar hydrolysates may also serve as raw material for other non-microbial processes, e.g., for enrichment, isolation and purification of high value sugars or various polymerization processes. The glucose monomers can also be used as intermediates or raw materials for the production of various chemicals or building blocks for the processes of chemical industry, e.g. in so called biorefinery. In the pulp and paper industry the polypeptides may be used to modify cellulosic fibre for example in treating kraft pulp, mechanical pulp, or recycled paper. In textile industry the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases find applications in softening and/or improving the feel of cotton fabrics and removing indigo dyes in replacement of stone washing. In feed industry the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention may be used in degrading the cellulosic or hemicellulosic materials present in feedstocks. In detergent industry the CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolase may be used in hand or machine laundry or dishwashing compositions for removal of cellulosic stains. The invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples. From the experimental results it can be concluded that the fungal CBHII/Cel6A cellobiohydrolases of the invention are capable of satisfying the greatly varying demands of different industry requiring efficient hydrolysis of cellulosic material present in varying feedstocks. EXAMPLE 1 Cloning of the Cellobiohydrolase 2 (cbh2) Genes Standard molecular biology methods were used in the isolation and enzyme treatments of DNA (e.g. isolation of plasmid DNA, digestion of DNA to produce DNA fragments), in E. coli transformations, sequencing etc. The basic methods used were either as described by the enzyme, reagent or kit manufacturer or as described in the standard molecular biology handbooks, e.g. Sambrook and Russell (2001). Isolation of genomic DNA was performed as described in detail by Raeder and Broda (1985). Four thermophilic fungal strains from the Roal Oy culture collection were selected for cloning based on the previous findings that the strains produce thermostable cellulases (WO2007071818; Maheshwari et al., 2000; Murray et al., 2003; Miettinen-Oinonen et al., 2004). The probes for cloning the cbh2 genes from Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245 and Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237 were synthesised by PCR. Degenerate oligos were planned basing on the alignment of the previously published amino acid sequences of cellobiohydrolase II (CBHII) proteins. The sequences of the homologous primers for the cloning of the cbh2 genes from Chaetomium thermophilum ALK4265 and Talaromyces emersonii RF8069 strains were obtained from the published nucleotide sequences (AY861348; DQ020255; CQ838150; Murray et al., 2003; AY075018; AF439936). The sequences of the primers are shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NOs: 1-6). TABLE 2 The oligonucleotides used as PCR primers to amplify probes for screening of cbh2 genes from Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245 and Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237 and to amplify full-length cbh2 genes from Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 and Talaromyces emersonii RF8069.

The probes were amplified by PCR with primers described in Table 2 using the genomic DNA as a template in the reactions. The PCR mixtures of Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245 and Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237 contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 5 μM each primer and 1-2 units of Dynazyme EXT DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland) and 0.5-1 μg of the corresponding genomic DNA. The conditions for the PCR reactions were the following: 5 min initial denaturation at 95° C., followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95° C., 1 min annealing at 60° C. (±5° C. gradient), 2 min extension at 72° C. and a final extension at 72° C. for 10 min. For PCR-cloning of the cbh2 genes from Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 and Talaromyces emersonii RF8069 strains, the reactions contained 1× Phusion GC and 1× Phusion HF buffers, respectively, with 0.2 mM dNTPs, 5 μM each primer and 1-2 units of Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland) and 0.5-1 μg of the corresponding genomic DNA. The conditions for the PCR reactions were the following: 3 min initial denaturation at 98° C., followed by 30 cycles of 30 sec at 98° C., 30 sec annealing at 55° C. (±5° C. gradient), 1-2 min extension at 72° C. and a final extension at 72° C. for 10 min. Primer combinations described in Table 2 produced a specific DNA product having the expected size (according to calculations basing on published cbh2 sequences). The DNA products were isolated and purified from the PCR reaction mixtures and cloned to pCR® 4Blunt-TOPO® vector according to the manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen, USA). The inserts were characterized by sequencing and by performing Southern blot hybridizations to the genomic DNAs digested with several restriction enzymes. The PCR fragments, which were chosen to be used as probes for gene cloning from the Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245 and Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237 strains are presented in Table 3. In addition, the table describes the PCR fragments containing the full-length cbh2 genes from Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 and Talaromyces emersonii RF8069 strains.

The 1757 bp PCR fragment in pALK2904 plasmid (SEQ ID NO:9) and the 1788 bp PCR fragment in pALK3006 plasmid (SEQ ID NO:10) contained the full-length cbh2/cel6A genes from Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 and Talaromyces emersonii RF8069, respectively. The gene encoding the Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 was named as Ct_ALKO4265_cel6A and Talaromyces emersonii RF8069 gene was named as Te_RF8069_cel6A. The E. coli strains RF8214 (=pALK2904) and RF8333 (=pALK3006) were deposited to the DSM collection under the accession numbers DSM 22947 and DSM 23185, respectively. Acremonium thermohilum ALKO4245 and Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237 genomic DNAs were digested with several restriction enzymes for Southern blot analysis. The probes for the hybridizations were the 1032 bp (SEQ ID NO:7) and 831 bp (SEQ ID NO:8) EcoRI fragments, cut from the plasmids pALK2580 and pALK2576, respectively. The above probes were labeled by using digoxigenin according to supplier's instructions (Roche, Germany). Hybridisations were performed over night at 68° C. After hybridization the filters were washed 2×5 min at RT using 2×SSC-0.1% SDS followed by 2×15 min at 68° C. using 0.1×SSC-0.1% SDS. From the genomic DNA of Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245, approximate 8 kb XbaI-digested fragment was hybridised using dioxigenin-labeled 1032 bp EcoRI fragment from the pALK2580 as a probe. Correspondingly, about 4.5 kb BamHI-digested fragment was hybridised with dioxigenin-labeled 831 bp EcoRI fragment of the pALK2576 from the genomic DNA of the Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237. The hydridising genomic DNA fragments were isolated from the pool of the digested genomic fragments based on their size. The genomic fragments were isolated from agarose gel and were cloned to pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene, USA) vectors cleaved with either XbaI (Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245) or BamHI (Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237). Ligation mixtures were transformed to Escherichia coli XL10-Gold cells (Stratagene) and plated on LB (Luria-Bertani) plates containing 50-100 μg/ml ampicillin. The E. coli colonies were screened for positive clones using colonial hybridization with the pALK2580 and pALK2576 inserts as probes in the hybridization conditions correspondingly to that described above for Southern blot analyses, except using the hybridization temperature of 65° C. instead of 68° C. Several positive clones were collected from the plates. They were shown by restriction digestion to contain inserts of expected sizes. The full-length gene encoding the Acremonium thermohilum ALKO4245 CBHII/Cel6A (At_ALKO4245_Cel6A, SEQ ID NO:11) was sequenced from the 7 kb XbaI insert and the plasmid containing this insert was named pALK2582. The E. coli strain RF8175 including the plasmid pALK2582 was deposited to the DSM collection under the accession number DSM 22946. The gene encoding the Acremonium thermohilum ALKO4245 protein was named as At_ALKO4245_cel6A. Correspondingly, the full-length gene encoding the Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237 CBHII/Cel6A (Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A, SEQ ID NO:12) was sequenced from the 5 kb BamHI insert and the plasmid containing this insert was named pALK2581. The E. coli strain RF8174 including the plasmid pALK2581 was deposited to the DSM collection under the accession number DSM 22945. The gene encoding the Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237 was named as Ma_ALKO4237_cel6A.

EXAMPLE 2 Production of Recombinant CBHII/Cel6A Proteins in Trichoderma reesei Expression plasmids were constructed for production of recombinant CBHII/Cel6A proteins from Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245, Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237, Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 and Talaromyces emersonii RF8069 in Trichoderma reesei. The expression plasmids constructed are listed in Table 9. The recombinant cbh2/cel6A genes, including their own signal sequences, were exactly fused to the T. reesei cbh1/cel7A promoter by PCR. The transcription termination was ensured by the T. reesei cbh1/cel7A terminator and the A. nidulans amdS marker gene was used for selection of the transformants as described in Paloheimo et al. (2003). The linear expression cassettes (FIG. 1) were isolated from the vector backbones after EcoRI or EcoRI-SpeI digestion and were transformed into T. reesei protoplasts. The host strain used does not produce any of the four major T. reesei cellulases (CBHI, CBHII, EGI, EGII). The transformations were performed as in Penttilä et al. (1987) with the modifications described in Karhunen et al. (1993), selecting acetamide as a sole nitrogen source (amdS marker gene). The transformants were purified on selection plates through single conidia prior to sporulating them on PD. TABLE 9 The expression cassettes constructed to produce CBHII/ Cel6A recombinant proteins from Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245, Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237, Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 and Talaromyces emersonii RF8069 in Trichoderma reesei. The overall structure of the expression cassettes was as described in FIG. 1. The cloned cbh2/cel6A genes were exactly fused to the T. reesei cbh1/cel7A promoter.

(bThe number of the nucleotides after the STOP codon of the cloned recombinant gene that was included in the expression cassette. The restriction site at the 3′-end of the genomic gene fragment that was used in the construction of the expression cassette is indicated in parenthesis. The Ct_ALK04265_cel6A gene fragment was excised from the 3′-end by EcoRI (a site present in the pCR ®4Blunt-TOPO ® vector). Correspondigly, the Te_RF8069_cel6A gene fragment was excised from its 3′-end by BamHI (a site created after stop codon in PCR). This leaves no original Ct_ALKO4265_cel6A or Te_RF8069_cel6A terminator in the constructs prior to the cbh1 terminator sequence. The CBHII/Cel6A production of the transformants was analysed from the culture supernatants of the shake flask cultivations. The transformants were inoculated from the PD slants to shake flasks containing 50 ml of complex lactose-based cellulase inducing medium (Joutsjoki et al., 1993) buffered with 5% KH2PO4. The CBHII/Cel6A protein production of the transformants was analyzed from the culture supernatants after growing them for 7 days at 30° C., 250 rpm. Heterologous production of recombinant proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Coomassive staining. The genotypes of the chosen transformants were confirmed by using Southern blot analyses in which several genomic digests were included and the respective expression cassette was used as a probe. The best-producing transformants were chosen to be cultivated in laboratory scale bioreactors. The transformants were cultivated in lab bioreactors at 28° C. in the cellulase inducing complex medium for 3-4 days with pH control 4.4±0.2 (NH3/H3PO4) to obtain material for the application tests. The supernatants were recovered by centrifugation and filtering through Seitz-K 150 and EK filters (Pall SeitzSchenk Filtersystems GmbH, Bad Kreuznach, Germany). EXAMPLE 3 Hydrolysis of Crystalline Cellulose (Avicel) by the Recombinant CBHII/Cel6A Enzymes The recombinant CBHII/Cel6A enzyme preparations were characterized in terms of pH dependence and thermal stability using crystalline cellulose (Avicel) as a substrate. The pH dependence and thermal stability for recombinant CBHII/Cel6A proteins from Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245, Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237, Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 and Talaromyces emersonii RF8069 were determined within a pH range of 3.0-10.0 and temperature range of 40° C.-80° C., respectively. The crystalline cellulose (Ph 101, Avicel; Fluka, Bucsh, Switzerland) hydrolysis assays were performed in 2.0 ml tube scale in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 6.0. For determination of the pH optima, substrate solutions (Avicel, 50 mg/ml in sodium acetate, pH 6.0) of pH range from 3 to 10 were shaken with the enzyme preparations (100 μg protein in reaction) at 50° C., and the final volume of the reaction mixture was 650 μl. The hydrolysis was continued for 21 hours and stopped by adding 326 μl of stop reagent containing 9 vol of 94% ethanol and 1 vol of 1 M glycine (pH 11). The solution was filtered through a Millex GV13 0.22 μm filtration unit (Millipore, Billerica, Mass., USA). The formation of soluble reducing sugars in the supernatant was determined by para-hydroxybenzoic-acidhydrazide (PAHBAH) method (Lever, 1972) using a cellobiose standard curve (200 μM to 1200 μM cellobiose). A freshly made 0.1 M PAHBAH (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) in 0.5 M NaOH solution (200 μl) was added to 300 μl of the filtered sample and boiled for 10 minutes after which the solution was cooled to room temperature. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured from duplicate samples by Multiskan EX (Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, Mass., USA). Correspondingly, thermal stability of the recombinant CBHII/Cel6A proteins was determined in Avicel subsrate solutions of temperature range from 40° C. to 80° C. at the optimum pH with the reaction time of 21 hours. Results indicate that the pH optimum for Talaromyces emersonii RF8069 CBHII/Cel6A and Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237 CBHII/Cel6A is at 4.0, whereas Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 and Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245 enzymes have pH optimum at 5.0 (FIG. 2). Thermal stability was found to be substantially higher for Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245, Chaetomium thermophilum ALKO4265 and Talaromyces emersonii RF8069 CBHII/Cel6A as compared to that of Melanocarpus albomyces ALKO4237 protein (FIG. 3). EXAMPLE 4 Hydrolysis of Hardwood Substrate with Enzyme Preparations Comprising a Recombinant CBHII/Cel6A Cellobiohydrolase Steam exploded hardwood was suspended in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8. The final weight of the hydrolysis mixture was 20 g of which the total solids concentration was 2% (w/w). The substrate was hydrolysed using different enzyme mixtures at a dosage of 5 mg of protein per g of total solids in 50 ml shake flasks. The protein contents of the enzyme components and the mixes were determined using the Pierce BCA assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Product number 23227) with Bovine Serum Albumin (Thermo Scientific, Product number 23209) as standard. The shake flasks were agitated in a linear-shaking waterbath adjusted in different temperatures. For each sample point, a sample of 1 ml was taken from duplicate shake flasks, and boiled for 10 minutes to terminate the enzymatic hydrolysis, centrifuged, and the supernatant was analysed for reaction products from the hydrolysis. The blanks containing substrate alone (only buffer added instead of enzymes) were prepared identically to the other samples. Three separate mixture combinations were prepared (a thermophilic MIXTURE 2, a mesophilic MIXTURE ACC and a mesophilic MIXTURE T. REESEI ENZYMES) with different Cel6A/CBHII replacements. A mixture of thermostable cellulases was prepared using the following components: Thermophilic Cel7A/CBHI preparation containing Thermoascus aurantiacus ALKO4242 Cel7A with genetically attached CBD of T. reesei CBHI/Cel7A (WO2007071818).Thermophilic endoglucanase preparation containing Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245 Cel45A endoglucanase (At EG—40/Cel45A, WO2007071818).Thermophilic β-glucosidase preparation containing Thermoascus aurantiacus ALKO4242 β-glucosidase (Ta βG—81/Cel3A, WO2007071818).Thermophilic xylanase preparation containing Nonomurea flexuosa Xyn11A (AM24, WO2005100557, AB Enzymes Oy, FI)). All cellulases were heterologously produced as monocomponents in Trichoderma reesei host strain having cellulase-free background (the genes encoding the four major cellulases Cel7A/CBHI, Cel6A/CBHII, Cel7B/EGI and Cel5A/EGII were deleted). Crude culture supernatants were used in the mixture. The enzyme components were combined as follows (per 10 ml of mixture): CBHI/Cel7A preparation 330 mg (71.2%), endoglucanase preparation 105 mg (22.7%), β-glucosidase preparation 7.5 mg (1.6%) and xylanase preparation 21 mg (4.5%). The volume was made up to 10 ml with tap water. The final protein concentration of the mixture was 46.35 mg/ml. This enzyme mixture was designated as MIXTURE 2. For testing Cel6A/CBHII performance in the hydrolysis with MIXTURE 2, 15% (49.5 mg) of the CBHI/Cel7A component of MIXTURE 2 was replaced by Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A (MIXTURE 2_MA), Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A (MIXTURE 2_CT), or At_ALKO4245_Cel6A (MIXTURE 2_AT), respectively. A state-of-the-art mixture was prepared by combining the following components (per 10 ml of mixture): ECONASE® CE (Roal Oy, a classical T. reesei enzyme product) 470 mg (94%), β-glucosidase preparation (At βG—101/Cel3A, WO2007071818) 20 mg (4%) and xylanase preparation (Ta XYN—30, WO2007071818) 10 mg (2%). The volume was made up to 10 ml with tap water. The final protein concentration in this mixture was 50 mg/ml. This enzyme mixture was designated as MIXTURE T. REESEI ENZYMES. At βG 101/Cel3A and Ta XYN—30 enzymes were heterologously produced as monocomponents in Trichoderma reesei host strain having cellulase-free background. For testing Cel6A/CBHII performance in the hydrolysis with MIXTURE T. REESEI ENZYMES, 15% (70.5 mg) of the ECONASE® CE component of MIXTURE T. REESEI ENZYMES was replaced by Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A (MIXTURE TR_MA), Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A (MIXTURE TR_CT), or At_ALKO4245_Cel6A (MIXTURE TR_AT), respectively. MIXTURE ACC was prepared from commercial Accellerase® 1000 (from Genencor International/Danisco A/S) product (per 10 ml): Accellerase® 1000 400 mg protein (100%). The volume was made up to 10 ml with tap water. The final protein concentration in this mixture was 40 mg/ml. For testing Cel6A/CBHII performance in the hydrolysis with MIXTURE ACC, 15% (60 mg) of the Accellerase® 1000 component of MIXTURE ACC was replaced by Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A (MIXTURE ACC_MA), Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A (MIXTURE ACC_CT), or At_ALKO4245_Cel6A (MIXTURE ACC_CT), respectively. For MIXTURE 2 combinations, the hydrolysis was performed at 55° C., while the hydrolysis temperature for MIXTURE T. REESEI ENZYMES and MIXTURE ACC experiments was 37° C. Samples were taken from the hydrolysis after 72 h, quantified by HPLC and the concentrations of glucose and xylose were determined. The results from the substrate blanks were subtracted from the samples with enzymes, and the concentration of glucose and xylose combined is shown in FIG. 4A-C. The results clearly show better performance of the MIXTURE 2 with the thermostable Cel6A/CBHII enzymes at 55° C. The amount of sugars released from the hardwood substrate was found to increase 12%, 14% and 26% by supplementing with Ma_ALKO4237_Cel6A, Ct_ALKO4265_Cel6A or At_ALKO4245_Cel6A enzymes in the MIXTURE 2, respectively. Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245 enzyme was found to be best-performing Cel6A/CBHII herein studied (FIG. 4A). At_ALKO4245_Cel6A shows increased hydrolysis also at 37° C. added either in the state-of-the-art Trichoderma mixture (MIXTURE T. REESEI ENZYMES) (FIG. 4B) or in the commercial product (MIXTURE ACC) (FIG. 4C). EXAMPLE 5 Hydrolysis of Corn Cobbs with Enzyme Preparations Comprising a Recombinant CBHII/Cel6A Cellobiohydrolase Steam exploded corn cobbs was suspended in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8. The final weight of the hydrolysis mixture was 20 g of which the total solids concentration was 2% (w/w). The substrate was hydrolysed using different enzyme mixtures at a dosage of 5 mg of protein per g of total solids in 50 ml shake flasks. The protein contents of the enzyme components and the mixes were determined using the Pierce BCA assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Product number 23227) with Bovine Serum Albumin (Thermo Scientific, Product number 23209) as standard. The shake flasks were agitated in a linear-shaking waterbath adjusted at 55° C. For each sample point, a sample of 1 ml was taken from duplicate shake flasks, and boiled for 10 minutes to terminate the enzymatic hydrolysis, centrifuged, and the supernatant was analysed for reaction products from the hydrolysis. The blanks containing substrate alone (only buffer added instead of enzymes) were prepared identically to the other samples. A mixture of thermostable cellulases was prepared using the following components: Thermophilic Cel7A/CBHI preparation containing Thermoascus aurantiacus ALKO4242 Cel7A with genetically attached CBD of T. reesei CBHI/Cel7A (WO2007071818).Thermophilic endoglucanase preparation containing Acremonium thermophilum ALKO4245 Cel45A endoglucanase (At EG—40/Cel45A, WO2007071818).Thermophilic β-glucosidase preparation containing Thermoascus aurantiacus ALKO4242 β-glucosidase (Ta βG—81/Cel3A, WO2007071818).Thermophilic xylanase preparation containing Nonomurea flexuosa Xyn11A (AM24, WO2005100557). All cellulases were heterologously produced as monocomponents in Trichoderma reesei host strain having cellulase-free background (the genes encoding the four major cellulases Cel7A/CBHI, Cel6A/CBHII, Cel7B/EGI and Cel5A/EGII were deleted).

The volume was made up to 10 ml with tap water. The final protein concentration of the mixture was 46.35 mg/ml. This enzyme mixture was designated as MIXTURE 2. For testing At_ALKO4245_Cel6A performance in the hydrolysis with MIXTURE 2, 15% (49.5 mg) of the CBHI/Cel7A component of MIXTURE 2 was replaced by At_ALKO4245_Cel6A (MIXTURE 2_AT), respectively. Samples were taken from the hydrolysis after 72 h, quantified by HPLC and the concentrations of glucose and xylose were determined. The results from the substrate blanks were subtracted from the samples with enzymes, and the concentration of glucose and xylose combined is shown in FIG. 5. Similar to that described in the Example 4, the results here clearly show better performance of the MIXTURE 2 with the At_ALKO4245_Cel6A enzyme at 55° C. for the corn cobbs substrate.
