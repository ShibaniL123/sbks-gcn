FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to compounds, methods and compositions for treating or preventing hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. More specifically, the invention describes specifically substituted aromatic compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or other derivatives thereof, and the use thereof in the treatment of HCV infection. Most of these compounds target the HCV NS5A phosphoprotein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected more than 180 million people worldwide. It is estimated that three to four million persons are newly infected each year, 70% of whom will develop chronic hepatitis. HCV is responsible for 50-76% of all liver cancer cases, and two thirds of all liver transplants in the developed world. Standard therapy [pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin (a nucleoside analog)] is only effective in 50-60% of patients and is associated with significant side-effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new HCV drugs. Hepatitis C virus genome comprises a positive-strand RNA enclosed in a nucleocapsid and lipid envelope and consists of 9.6 kb ribonucleotides and has a single open reading frame (ORP) encoding which encodes a large polypeptide of about 3000 amino acids (Dymock et al. Antiviral Chemistry & Chemotherapy 2000, 11, 79). Following maturation, this polypeptide is cut into at least 10 proteins by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases: 1) a metalloprotease that cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction; and 2) a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 (NS3 protease) which mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions including the NS4A/NS3 complex formation, which appears to enhance the proteolytic efficiency of the NS3 protein. NS5B (also referred to herein as HCV polymerase), possesses polymerase activity and is involved in the synthesis of double-stranded RNA from the single-stranded viral RNA genome that serves as the template. NS5A is a nonstructural 56-58 kDa protein which modulates HCV replication as a component of replication complex. NS5A is highly phosphorylated by cellular protein kinases and the phosphorylation sites are conserved among HCV genotypes (Katze et al, 2001; Kim et al, 1999) The discovery of novel antiviral strategies to selectively inhibit HCV replication has long been hindered by the lack of convenient cell culture models for the propagation of HCV (“Recent Advances in Nucleoside Monophosphate Prodrugs as Anti-hepatitis C Virus Agents” Bobeck, D. R.; Coats, S. J.; Schinazi, R. F. Antivir. Ther. 2010; Book Chapter: “Approaches for the Development of Antiviral Compounds: The Case of Hepatitis C Virus.” Raymond F. Schinazi, Steven J. Coats, Leda C. Bassit, Johan Lennerstrand, James H. Nettles, and Selwyn J. Hurwitz in: Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, vol. 189, 25-51: Antiviral Strategies; Edited by: Hans-Georg Kräusslich and Ralf Bartenschlager © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009). This hurdle has been overcome first with the establishment of the HCV replicon system in 1999 (Bartenschlager, R., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002, 1, 911-916 and Bartenschlager, R., J. Hepatol. 2005, 43, 210-216) and, in 2005, with the development of robust HCV cell culture models (Wakita, T., et al., Nat. Med. 2005, 11, 791-6; Zhong, J., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005, 102, 9294-9; Lindenbach, B. D., et al., Science 2005, 309, 623-6). It would be advantageous to provide new antiviral agents, compositions including these agents, and methods of treatment using these agents, particularly to treat HCV and drug-resistant HCV. The present invention provides such agents, compositions and methods. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides compounds, methods and compositions for treating or preventing HCV infection in a host.

Representative compounds include the following: III. STEREOISOMERISM AND POLYMORPHISM The compounds described herein can have asymmetric centers and occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, individual diastereomers or enantiomers, with all isomeric forms being included in the present invention. Compounds of the present invention having a chiral center can exist in and be isolated in optically active and racemic forms. Some compounds can exhibit polymorphism. The present invention encompasses racemic, optically-active, polymorphic, or stereoisomeric forms, or mixtures thereof, of a compound of the invention, which possess the useful properties described herein. The optically active forms can be prepared by, for example, resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques, by synthesis from optically-active starting materials, by chiral synthesis, or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase or by enzymatic resolution. One can either purify the respective compound, then derivatize the compound to form the compounds described herein, or purify the compound themselves. Optically active forms of the compounds can be prepared using any method known in the art, including but not limited to by resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques, by synthesis from optically-active starting materials, by chiral synthesis, or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase. Examples of methods to obtain optically active materials include at least the following. i) physical separation of crystals: a technique whereby macroscopic crystals of the individual enantiomers are manually separated. This technique can be used if crystals of the separate enantiomers exist, i.e., the material is a conglomerate, and the crystals are visually distinct; ii) simultaneous crystallization: a technique whereby the individual enantiomers are separately crystallized from a solution of the racemate, possible only if the latter is a conglomerate in the solid state; iii) enzymatic resolutions: a technique whereby partial or complete separation of a racemate by virtue of differing rates of reaction for the enantiomers with an enzyme; iv) enzymatic asymmetric synthesis: a synthetic technique whereby at least one step of the synthesis uses an enzymatic reaction to obtain an enantiomerically pure or enriched synthetic precursor of the desired enantiomer; v) chemical asymmetric synthesis: a synthetic technique whereby the desired enantiomer is synthesized from an achiral precursor under conditions that produce asymmetry (i.e., chirality) in the product, which can be achieved using chiral catalysts or chiral auxiliaries; vi) diastereomer separations: a technique whereby a racemic compound is reacted with an enantiomerically pure reagent (the chiral auxiliary) that converts the individual enantiomers to diastereomers. The resulting diastereomers are then separated by chromatography or crystallization by virtue of their now more distinct structural differences and the chiral auxiliary later removed to obtain the desired enantiomer; vii) first- and second-order asymmetric transformations: a technique whereby diastereomers from the racemate equilibrate to yield a preponderance in solution of the diastereomer from the desired enantiomer or where preferential crystallization of the diastereomer from the desired enantiomer perturbs the equilibrium such that eventually in principle all the material is converted to the crystalline diastereomer from the desired enantiomer. The desired enantiomer is then released from the diastereomer; viii) kinetic resolutions: this technique refers to the achievement of partial or complete resolution of a racemate (or of a further resolution of a partially resolved compound) by virtue of unequal reaction rates of the enantiomers with a chiral, non-racemic reagent or catalyst under kinetic conditions; ix) enantiospecific synthesis from non-racemic precursors: a synthetic technique whereby the desired enantiomer is obtained from non-chiral starting materials and where the stereochemical integrity is not or is only minimally compromised over the course of the synthesis; x) chiral liquid chromatography: a technique whereby the enantiomers of a racemate are separated in a liquid mobile phase by virtue of their differing interactions with a stationary phase (including but not limited to via chiral HPLC). The stationary phase can be made of chiral material or the mobile phase can contain an additional chiral material to provoke the differing interactions; xi) chiral gas chromatography: a technique whereby the racemate is volatilized and enantiomers are separated by virtue of their differing interactions in the gaseous mobile phase with a column containing a fixed non-racemic chiral adsorbent phase; xii) extraction with chiral solvents: a technique whereby the enantiomers are separated by virtue of preferential dissolution of one enantiomer into a particular chiral solvent; xiii) transport across chiral membranes: a technique whereby a racemate is placed in contact with a thin membrane barrier. The barrier typically separates two miscible fluids, one containing the racemate, and a driving force such as concentration or pressure differential causes preferential transport across the membrane barrier. Separation occurs as a result of the non-racemic chiral nature of the membrane that allows only one enantiomer of the racemate to pass through. Chiral chromatography, including but not limited to simulated moving bed chromatography, is used in one embodiment. A wide variety of chiral stationary phases are commercially available. IV. SALT OR PRODRUG FORMULATIONS In cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable nontoxic acid or base salts, administration of the compound as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids, which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, α-ketoglutarate and α-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts can also be formed, including but not limited to, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate and carbonate salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid, affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (e.g., sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (e.g., calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made. A prodrug is a pharmacological substance that is administered in an inactive (or significantly less active) form and subsequently metabolized in vivo to an active metabolite. Getting more drug to the desired target at a lower dose is often the rationale behind the use of a prodrug and is generally attributed to better absorption, distribution, metabolism, and/or excretion (ADME) properties. Prodrugs are usually designed to improve oral bioavailability, with poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract usually being the limiting factor. Additionally, the use of a prodrug strategy can increase the selectivity of the drug for its intended target thus reducing the potential for off target effects. V. METHODS OF TREATMENT Hosts, including but not limited to humans, infected with HCV or a gene fragment thereof, can be treated by administering to the patient an effective amount of the active compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or salt thereof in the presence of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The active materials can be administered by any appropriate route, for example, orally, parenterally, intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, or topically, in liquid or solid form. VI. COMBINATION OR ALTERNATION THERAPY In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be employed together with at least one other antiviral agent, selected from polymerase inhibitors, IMPDH inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and immune-based therapeutic agents. For example, when used to treat or prevent HCV infection, the active compound or its prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be administered in combination or alternation with another anti-HCV including, but not limited to, those of the formulae above. In general, in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more agents are administered together, whereas during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each agent is administered serially. The dosage will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the drug, as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens and schedules should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. Nonlimiting examples of antiviral agents that can be used in combination with the compounds disclosed herein include those in the tables below.

It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition. The active ingredient can be administered at once, or can be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at varying intervals of time. A preferred mode of administration of the active compound is oral. Oral compositions will generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches or capsules.

In a preferred embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including but not limited to implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters and polylactic acid. For example, enterically coated compounds can be used to protect cleavage by stomach acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Suitable materials can also be obtained commercially. Liposomal suspensions (including but not limited to liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) are also preferred as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811 (incorporated by reference). For example, liposome formulations can be prepared by dissolving appropriate lipid(s) (such as stearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, stearoyl phosphatidyl choline, arachadoyl phosphatidyl choline, and cholesterol) in an inorganic solvent that is then evaporated, leaving behind a thin film of dried lipid on the surface of the container. An aqueous solution of the active compound is then introduced into the container. The container is then swirled by hand to free lipid material from the sides of the container and to disperse lipid aggregates, thereby forming the liposomal suspension. The terms used in describing the invention are commonly used and known to those skilled in the art.

Finally the reaction of compound IV with an appropriately N-substituted carboxylic acid in the presence of coupling agent leads to the formation of compounds V. The synthesis of compounds of formula VII is illustrated Scheme 2. Azido compounds of formula VI can be reacted with substituted alkynes to provide triazolo derivatives of formula VII. TABLE 1 Compounds that can be prepared via Schemes 1 and 2.

Anhydrous solvents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, Wis.) and EMD Chemicals Inc. (Gibbstown, N.J.). Reagents were purchased from commercial sources. Unless noted otherwise, the materials used in the examples were obtained from readily available commercial suppliers or synthesized by standard methods known to one skilled in the art of chemical synthesis. Melting points (mp) were determined on an Electrothermal digit melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were taken on a Varian Unity Plus 400 spectrometer at room temperature and reported in ppm downfield from internal tetramethylsilane. Deuterium exchange, decoupling experiments or 2D-COSY were performed to confirm proton assignments. Signal multiplicities are represented by s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet of doublets), t (triplet), q (quadruplet), br (broad), bs (broad singlet), m (multiplet). All J-values are in Hz. Mass spectra were determined on a Micromass Platform LC spectrometer using electrospray techniques. Elemental analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab Inc. (Norcross, Ga.). Analytic TLC was performed on Whatman LK6F silica gel plates, and preparative TLC on Whatman PK5F silica gel plates. Column chromatography was carried out on Silica Gel or via reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography.

Example 4 Cellular Toxicity Assays The toxicity of the compounds was assessed in Vero, human PBM, CEM (human lymphoblastoid), MT-2, and HepG2 cells, as described previously (see Schinazi R. F., Sommadossi J.-P., Saalmann V., Cannon D. L., Xie M.-Y., Hart G. C., Smith G. A. & Hahn E. F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990, 34, 1061-67). Cycloheximide was included as positive cytotoxic control, and untreated cells exposed to solvent were included as negative controls. The cytotoxicity IC50 was obtained from the concentration-response curve using the median effective method described previously (see Chou T.-C. & Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984, 22, 27-55; Belen'kii M. S. & Schinazi R. F. Antiviral Res. 1994, 25, 1-11). Example 5 Mitochondrial Toxicity Assays in HepG2 Cells i) Effect of Compounds on Cell Growth and Lactic Acid Production: The effect on the growth of HepG2 cells can be determined by incubating cells in the presence of 0 μM, 0.1 μM, 1 μM, 10 μM and 100 μM drug. Cells (5×104 per well) can be plated into 12-well cell culture clusters in minimum essential medium with nonessential amino acids supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and incubated for 4 days at 37° C. At the end of the incubation period the cell number can be determined using a hemocytometer. Also taught by Pan-Zhou X—R, Cui L, Zhou X-J, Sommadossi J-P, Darley-Usmer V M. “Differential effects of antiretroviral nucleoside analogs on mitochondrial function in HepG2 cells” Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 496-503. To measure the effects of the compounds on lactic acid production, HepG2 cells from a stock culture can be diluted and plated in 12-well culture plates at 2.5×104 cells per well. Various concentrations (0 μM, 0.1 μM, 1 μM, 10 μM and 100 μM) of compound were added, and the cultures can be incubated at 37° C. in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 4 days. At day 4, the number of cells in each well can be determined and the culture medium collected. The culture medium is then filtered, and the lactic acid content in the medium can be determined using a colorimetric lactic acid assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Since lactic acid product can be considered a marker for impaired mitochondrial function, elevated levels of lactic acid production detected in cells grown in the presence of test compounds would indicate a drug-induced cytotoxic effect. ii) Effect on Compounds on Mitochondrial DNA Synthesis: A real-time PCR assay to accurately quantify mitochondrial DNA content has been developed (see Stuyver L J, Lostia S, Adams M, Mathew J S, Pai B S, Grier J, Tharnish P M, Choi Y, Chong Y, Choo H, Chu C K, Otto M J, Schinazi R F. Antiviral activities and cellular toxicities of modified 2′,3′-dideoxy-2′,3′-didehydrocytidine analogs. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3854-60). This assay can be used in all studies described in this application that determine the effect of compounds on mitochondrial DNA content. In this assay, low-passage-number HepG2 cells are seeded at 5,000 cells/well in collagen-coated 96-well plates. Test compounds are added to the medium to obtain final concentrations of 0 μM, 0.1 μM, 10 μM and 100 μM. On culture day 7, cellular nucleic acids are prepared by using commercially available columns (RNeasy 96 kit; Qiagen). These kits co-purify RNA and DNA, and hence, total nucleic acids are eluted from the columns. The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COXII) gene and the β-actin or rRNA gene are amplified from 5 μl of the eluted nucleic acids using a multiplex Q-PCR protocol with suitable primers and probes for both target and reference amplifications. For COXII the following sense, probe and antisense primers are used, respectively: 5′-TGCCCGCCATCATCCTA-3′,5′-tetrachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein-TCCTCATCGCCCTCCCATCCC-TAMRA-3′ and 5′-CGTCTGTTATGTAAAGGATGCGT-3′. For exon 3 of the β-actin in gene (GenBank accession number E01094) the sense, probe, and antisense primers are 5′-GCGCGGCTACAGCTTCA-3′,5′-6-FAMCACCACGGCCGAGCGGGATAMRA-3′ and 5′-TCTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGAT-3′, respectively. The primers and probes for the rRNA gene are commercially available from Applied Biosystems. Since equal amplification efficiencies are obtained for all genes, the comparative CT method can be used to investigate potential inhibition of mitochondrial DNA synthesis. The comparative CT method uses arithmetic formulas in which the amount of target (COXII gene) is normalized to the amount of an endogenous reference (the β-actin or rRNA gene) and is relative to a calibrator (a control with no drug at day 7). The arithmetic formula for this approach is given by 2-ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT is (CT for average target test sample−CT for target control)−(CT for average reference test−CT for reference control) (see Johnson M R, K Wang, J B Smith, M J Heslin, R B Diasio. Quantitation of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase expression by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278:175-184). A decrease in mitochondrial DNA content in cells grown in the presence of drug would indicate mitochondrial toxicity. Example 6 Mitochondrial Toxicity Assays in Neuro2A Cells To estimate the potential of the compounds of this invention to cause neuronal toxicity, mouse Neuro2A cells (American Type Culture Collection 131) were used as a model system (see Ray A S, Hernandez-Santiago B I, Mathew J S, Murakami E, Bozeman C, Xie M Y, Dutschman G E, Gullen E, Yang Z, Hurwitz S, Cheng Y C, Chu C K, McClure H, Schinazi R F, Anderson K S. Mechanism of anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity of beta-D-6-cyclopropylamino-2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005, 49, 1994-2001). The concentrations necessary to inhibit cell growth by 50% (CC50) were measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye-based assay, as described. Perturbations in cellular lactic acid and mitochondrial DNA levels at defined concentrations of drug were carried out as described above. In all experiments, ddC and AZT were used as control nucleoside analogs. Example 7 Assay for Bone Marrow Cytotoxicity Primary human bone marrow mononuclear cells can be obtained commercially from Cambrex Bioscience (Walkersville, Md.). CFU-GM assays can be carried out using a bilayer soft agar in the presence of 50 units/mL human recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, while BFU-E assays use a methylcellulose matrix containing 1 unit/mL erythropoietin (see Sommadossi J P, Carlisle R. Toxicity of 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine and 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl) guanine for normal human hepatopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 452-454; Sommadossi, J P, Schinazi, R F, Chu, C K, and Xie, M Y. Comparison of cytotoxicity of the (−) and (+) enantiomer of 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine in normal human bone marrow progenitor cells. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44:1921-1925). Each experiment can be performed in duplicate in cells from three different donors. AZT can be used as a positive control. Cells can be incubated in the presence of the compound for 14-18 days at 37° C. with 5% CO2, and colonies of greater than 50 cells can be counted using an inverted microscope to determine IC50. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) can be obtained by least-squares linear regression analysis of the logarithm of drug concentration versus BFU-E survival fractions. Statistical analysis can be performed with Student's t test for independent non-paired samples. Example 8 HCV Replicon Assay1 Huh 7 Clone B cells containing HCV Replicon RNA would be seeded in a 96-well plate at 5000 cells/well, and the compounds tested at 10 μM in triplicate immediately after seeding. Following five days incubation (37° C., 5% CO2), total cellular RNA was isolated by using versaGene RNA purification kit from Gentra. Replicon RNA and an internal control (TaqMan rRNA control reagents, Applied Biosystems) were amplified in a single step multiplex Real Time RT-PCR Assay. The antiviral effectiveness of the compounds was calculated by subtracting the threshold RT-PCR cycle of the test compound from the threshold RT-PCR cycle of the no-drug control (ΔCt HCV). A ΔCt of 3.3 equals a 1-log reduction (equal to 90% less starting material) in Replicon RNA levels. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was also calculated by using the ΔCt rRNA values. 2′-C-Me-C was used as the positive control. To determine EC90 and IC50 values2, ΔCt: values were first converted into fraction of starting material3 and then were used to calculate the % inhibition. REFERENCES 1.

Chemicals Methanol and acetonitrile were purchased from (Fisher Scientific) Formic acid was purchased from ACROS Organics. Water was purified and deionized. Instrumentation The HPLC system was an Ultimate 3000 modular LC system consisting of two ternary pump, vacuum degasser, thermostated autosampler, and thermostated column compartment (Dionex Corporation; Sunnyvale, Calif.). A TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass., USA.) was used for detection. Thermo Xcalibur software version 2.0 was used to operate HPLC, the mass spectrometer and to perform data analyses. Method Summary & Results Compounds (1 μM final concentration) were incubated with human liver microsomes in potassium phosphate buffer. The microsomal protein concentration in the assay was 1 mg/mL and the final percent DMSO was less than 0.2%. Reaction was started by the addition of NADPH and stopped at 60 min by 200 μL of 80% ice cold MeOH (containing 100 nM of the internal standard RS-1174). The samples were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Gradient separation was performed on a Hypersil GOLD column (100×1.0 mm) with a 3 μm particle size (Thermo Electron, Waltham, Mass.). The mobile phase A consisted of water containing 0.1% formic acid and B consisted of acetonitrile. Mobile phase B was increased from 15% to 100% in 8 min, and kept at 100% for 2 min. The flow rate was maintained at 50 μL/min and a 25 μL injection volume was used. The autosampler was maintained at 4° C., and the column was maintained at 30° C. The first 3.0 min of the analysis was diverted to waste.
