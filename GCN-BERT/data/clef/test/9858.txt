BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present disclosure relates to electrosurgical devices suitable for use in tissue ablation applications and, more particularly, to microwave field-detecting needle assemblies, methods of manufacturing the same, methods of adjusting an ablation field radiating into tissue using the same, and systems including the same. 2. Discussion of Related Art Treatment of certain diseases requires the destruction of malignant tissue growths, e.g., tumors. Electromagnetic radiation can be used to heat and destroy tumor cells. Treatment may involve inserting ablation probes into tissues where cancerous tumors have been identified. Once the probes are positioned, electromagnetic energy is passed through the probes into surrounding tissue. In the treatment of diseases such as cancer, certain types of tumor cells have been found to denature at elevated temperatures that are slightly lower than temperatures normally injurious to healthy cells. Known treatment methods, such as hyperthermia therapy, heat diseased cells to temperatures above 41Â° C. while maintaining adjacent healthy cells below the temperature at which irreversible cell destruction occurs. These methods involve applying electromagnetic radiation to heat, ablate and/or coagulate tissue. Microwave energy is sometimes utilized to perform these methods. Other procedures utilizing electromagnetic radiation to heat tissue also include coagulation, cutting and/or ablation of tissue. Electrosurgical devices utilizing electromagnetic radiation have been developed for a variety of uses and applications. A number of devices are available that can be used to provide high bursts of energy for short periods of time to achieve cutting and coagulative effects on various tissues. There are a number of different types of apparatus that can be used to perform ablation procedures. Typically, microwave apparatus for use in ablation procedures include a microwave generator that functions as an energy source and a microwave surgical instrument (e.g., microwave ablation probe) having an antenna assembly for directing energy to the target tissue. The microwave generator and surgical instrument are typically operatively coupled by a cable assembly having a plurality of conductors for transmitting microwave energy from the generator to the instrument, and for communicating control, feedback and identification signals between the instrument and the generator. The particular type of tissue ablation procedure may dictate a particular ablation volume in order to achieve a desired surgical outcome. Ablation volume is correlated with antenna design, antenna performance, antenna impedance, ablation time and wattage, and tissue characteristics, e.g., tissue impedance. Because of the small temperature difference between the temperature required for denaturing malignant cells and the temperature normally injurious to healthy cells, a known heating pattern and precise temperature control is needed to lead to more predictable temperature distribution to eradicate the tumor cells while minimizing the damage to surrounding normal tissue. In some cases, it may be difficult for the physician to determine when a microwave ablation probe is inserted to a proper depth within tissue, e.g., to reach the location of the ablation site and/or to avoid unintended radiation exposure.

Like reference numerals may refer to similar or identical elements throughout the description of the figures. As shown in the drawings and as used in this description, and as is traditional when referring to relative positioning on an object, the term âproximalâ refers to that portion of the apparatus, or component thereof, closer to the user and the term âdistalâ refers to that portion of the apparatus, or component thereof, farther from the user. This description may use the phrases âin an embodiment,â âin embodiments,â âin some embodiments,â or âin other embodiments,â which may each refer to one or more of the same or different embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure. For the purposes of this description, a phrase in the form âA/Bâ means A or B. For the purposes of the description, a phrase in the form âA and/or Bâ means â(A), (B), or (A and B)â. For the purposes of this description, a phrase in the form âat least one of A, B, or Câ means â(A), (B), (C), (A and B), (A and C), (B and C), or (A, B and C)â. Electromagnetic energy is generally classified by increasing energy or decreasing wavelength into radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma-rays. As it is used in this description, âmicrowaveâ generally refers to electromagnetic waves in the frequency range of 300 megahertz (MHz) (3Ã108 cycles/second) to 300 gigahertz (GHz) (3Ã1011 cycles/second). As it is used in this description, âtransmission lineâ generally refers to any transmission medium that can be used for the propagation of signals from one point to another. As it is used in this description, âablation procedureâ generally refers to any ablation procedure, such as, for example, microwave ablation, radiofrequency (RF) ablation, or microwave or RF ablation-assisted resection. As it is used in this description, âenergy applicatorâ generally refers to any device that can be used to transfer energy from a power generating source, such as a microwave or RF electrosurgical generator, to tissue. For the purposes herein, the term âenergy applicatorâ is interchangeable with the term âenergy-delivery deviceâ. As it is used in this description, ârectifierâ generally refers to circuit components that allow more electric current to flow in one direction than in the other. Rectifiers may be made of solid-state diodes, vacuum-tube diodes, mercury-arc valves, and other components. Processes that make use of rectifiers include rectification, which, simply defined, is the conversion of alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). As it is used in this description, âdiodeâ generally refers to electronic devices that allow electric current to flow in only one direction, while inhibiting current flow in the other. For the purposes herein, the term âdiodeâ is interchangeable with the term ârectifierâ.

As it is used in this description, âlengthâ may refer to electrical length or physical length. In general, electrical length is an expression of the length of a transmission medium in terms of the wavelength of a signal propagating within the medium. Electrical length is normally expressed in terms of wavelength, radians or degrees. For example, electrical length may be expressed as a multiple or sub-multiple of the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave or electrical signal propagating within a transmission medium. The wavelength may be expressed in radians or in artificial units of angular measure, such as degrees. The electric length of a transmission medium may be expressed as its physical length multiplied by the ratio of (a) the propagation time of an electrical or electromagnetic signal through the medium to (b) the propagation time of an electromagnetic wave in free space over a distance equal to the physical length of the medium. The electrical length is in general different from the physical length. By the addition of an appropriate reactive element (capacitive or inductive), the electrical length may be made significantly shorter or longer than the physical length.

The outer jacket 90 may be applied by any suitable method, such as, for example, heat-shrinkage, extrusion, molding, coating, spraying, dipping, powder coating, baking and/or film deposition, or other suitable process. In an embodiment, as best shown in FIG. 14, which shows the cross section of the needle assembly portion of FIG. 13, outer jacket 90 covers the rectifier element 58. In alternative embodiments, the outer jacket 90 may include an opening (not shown) configured to expose the rectifier element 58 and/or the junction structure 50, or portion thereof. The position of the junction structure 50 and rectifier element 58, e.g., in relation to the tip 34, is one factor in determining the operational frequency of the microwave field-detecting needle assembly 100 in a given material, e.g., tissue. To obtain a microwave field-detecting needle assembly having a desired frequency, the junction structure 50 may be positioned at a location of high voltage along the expected standing wave that couples onto the probe, such as illustratively shown in FIG. 15. During a procedure, e.g., an ablation procedure, fields 1501, 1502 couple onto the microwave field-detecting needle assembly 100 from the energy supplied by an energy-delivery device (e.g., 12 shown in FIG. 18), e.g., a microwave ablation probe. FIGS. 16 and 17 show a needle assembly (shown generally as 1610) according to an embodiment of the present disclosure that is adapted to enable multi-frequency operation and/or multiple wavelength operation. Needle assembly 1610 is similar to the needle assembly 110 shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 5, except for the configuration of the junction structure 1650, the first outer-conductor structure 1630 and the second outer-conductor structure 1660, and the plurality of rectifiers 1658 disposed in the plurality of recesses 1656. Needle assembly 1610 includes a junction structure 1650 configured to separate a first outer-conductor structure 1630 and a second outer-conductor structure 1660 in a diagonal fashion. First outer-conductor structure 1630 and the second outer-conductor structure 1660 may be formed of any suitable electrically-conductive material, e.g., metal such as stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, copper, or the like. In some embodiments, the first outer-conductor structure 1630 is constructed from stainless steel, and may be coated in a high electrical conductivity, corrosion-resistant metal, e.g., silver, or the like. As best shown in FIG. 16, the junction structure 1650 includes a plurality of recesses 1656 defined therein, wherein each recess 1656 is defined in a different outer-peripheral portion of the junction structure 1650 and configured to receive a rectifier 1658 therein. Rectifier 1658 is similar to the rectifier 58 shown in FIG. 2 and further description thereof is omitted in the interests of brevity. Each rectifier 1658 may be configured to operate efficiently at separate frequencies allowing for probe use at multiple frequencies. FIG. 18 shows an electrosurgical system 1800 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure that includes an energy applicator or probe 12 operably coupled to an electrosurgical power generating source 26. In some embodiments, the probe 12 may be coupled in fluid communication with a coolant supply system (not shown). Electrosurgical system 1800 (also referred to herein as a âmicrowave ablation control systemâ) generally includes one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100 and a control unit 24 in operable communication with the one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100. Control unit 24 and the one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100 may utilize wired communication and/or wireless communication. Control unit 24 is similar to the control unit 28 shown in FIG. 4 and further description thereof is omitted in the interests of brevity. Electrosurgical system 1800 according to various embodiments may include a feedback loop 18 suitable for use in controlling an energy applicator or probe 12 based on one or more electrical signals transmitted by one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100. Feedback loop 18 may utilize a cable connection and/or a wireless connection, e.g., a radiofrequency or infrared link. In some embodiments, the microwave ablation control system 1800 may adjust the ablation field radiating about at least a portion of the energy applicator 12 into tissue by adjusting one or more operating parameters associated with the electrosurgical power generating source 26 based on one or more electrical signals transmitted by one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 18, the plurality of microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100 in operable communication with the control unit 24 are operable coupled via the feedback loop 18 to the electrosurgical power generating source 26. Examples of operating parameters associated with the electrosurgical power generating source 26 include temperature, impedance, power, current, voltage, mode of operation, and duration of application of electromagnetic energy. It is to be understood that, although one energy applicator 12 and three microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100 are shown in FIG. 18, electrosurgical system embodiments may utilize single or multiple energy applicators (or applicator arrays) and one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies. The single or multiple energy applicators and the one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies may be arranged in any suitable configuration. Electrosurgical power generating source 26 may be any generator suitable for use with electrosurgical devices, and may be configured to provide various frequencies of electromagnetic energy. In some embodiments, the electrosurgical power generating source 26 is configured to provide microwave energy at an operational frequency from about 300 MHz to about 10 GHz. In other embodiments, the electrosurgical power generating source 26 is configured to provide electrosurgical energy at an operational frequency from about 400 KHz to about 500 KHz. In some embodiments, the electrosurgical power generating source 26 is configured or set to a predetermined setting. For example, electrosurgical power generating source 26 may be set to a predetermined temperature, such as a temperature that may be used for the treatment of pain (e.g., about 42Â° C. or about 80Â° C.), a predetermined waveform, a predetermined duty cycle, a predetermined time period or duration of activation, etc. Electrosurgical power generating source 26 may include a user interface 25 (FIG. 19) in operable communication with a processor unit 82 (FIG. 19). Processor unit 82, which is described in more detail with respect to FIG. 19, may be any type of computing device, computational circuit, or any type of processor or processing circuit capable of executing a series of instructions that are stored in a memory. In an embodiment, a physician may input via the user interface 25 a selected power output, and the microwave ablation control system 1800 controls the probe 12 to automatically adjust the ablation volume by changing the operating frequency of the probe 12, e.g., based on at least one electrical signal transmitted by the one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100. In an embodiment, a physician may input via the user interface 25 a selected power output, and the microwave ablation control system 1800 controls the ablation field radiating about at least a portion of the energy applicator 12 into tissue based on one or more electrical signals transmitted by one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100, e.g., by rotation of a energy applicator with a directional radiation pattern to avoid ablating sensitive structures, such as large vessels, healthy organs or vital membrane barriers and/or by controlling the electrosurgical power generating source 26 operatively associated with an energy applicator 12. During microwave ablation using the microwave ablation control system 1800, one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100 may be inserted into tissue âTâ and/or placed adjacent a sensitive structure âSâ, and/or one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100 may be inserted into the abdominal wall âWâ and/or into the abdominal cavity âCâ. Probe 12 is inserted into tissue âTâ and/or placed adjacent to a lesion L. Ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) guidance may be used to accurately guide the probe 12 into the area of tissue to be treated. Probe 12 and one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100 may be placed percutaneously or surgically, e.g., using conventional surgical techniques by surgical staff. After the one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies 100 and the probe 12 are positioned, microwave energy is supplied to the probe 12. A clinician may pre-determine the length of time that microwave energy is to be applied. Application duration may depend on many factors such as tumor size and location and whether the tumor was a secondary or primary cancer. The duration of microwave energy application using the probe 12 may depend on the progress of the heat distribution within the tissue area that is to be destroyed and/or the surrounding tissue. Treatment of certain tumors may involve probe repositioning during the ablation procedure, such as where the tumor is larger than the probe or has a shape that does not correspond with available probe geometry or radiation pattern. FIG. 19 is a block diagram showing one embodiment of the electrosurgical power generating source 26 of FIG. 18. In an embodiment, the generator module 86 is configured to provide energy of about 915 MHz. Generator module 86 may additionally, or alternatively, be configured to provide energy of about 2450 MHz (2.45 GHz). The present disclosure contemplates embodiments wherein the generator module 286 is configured to generate a frequency other than about 915 MHz or about 2450 MHz, and embodiments wherein the generator module 86 is configured to generate variable frequency energy. Electrosurgical power generating source 26 includes a processor 82 that is operably coupled to the user interface 25.

Storage device 88 may include a set of program instructions executable on the processor 82 for executing a method for displaying and controlling ablation patterns in accordance with the present disclosure. Electrosurgical power generating source 26 may include a data interface 90 that is configured to provide a communications link to an external device 91. In some embodiments, the data interface 90 may be any of a USB interface, a memory card slot (e.g., SD slot), and/or a network interface (e.g., 100BaseT Ethernet interface or an 802.11 âWi-Fiâ interface.) External device 91 may be any of a USB device (e.g., a memory stick), a memory card (e.g., an SD card), and/or a network-connected device (e.g., computer or server). Electrosurgical power generating source 26 may also include a database 84 that is configured to store and retrieve energy applicator data, e.g., parameters associated with one or energy applicators (e.g., 12 shown in FIGS. 18 and 19). Parameters stored in the database 84 in connection with an energy applicator, or energy applicator array, may include, but are not limited to, energy applicator (or applicator array) identifier, energy applicator (or applicator array) dimensions, a frequency, an ablation length, an ablation diameter, a temporal coefficient, a shape metric, and/or a frequency metric. In an embodiment, ablation pattern topology may be included in the database 84, e.g., a wireframe model of an applicator array and/or an ablation pattern associated therewith and/or an arrangement of microwave field-detecting needle assemblies for use in connection with one or more energy applicators. Database 84 may also be maintained at least in part by data provided by the external device 91 via the data interface 90. For example without limitation, data associated with energy applicator 12 may be uploaded from an external device 91 to the database 84 via the data interface 90. Energy applicator data may additionally, or alternatively, be manipulated, e.g., added, modified, or deleted, in accordance with data and/or instructions stored on the external device 91. In an embodiment, the set of energy applicator data represented in the database 84 is automatically synchronized with corresponding data contained in the external device 91 in response to the external device 91 being coupled (e.g., physical coupling and/or logical coupling) to the data interface 90. Processor 82 according to various embodiments is programmed to enable a user, via the user interface 25 and/or a display device (not shown), to view at least one ablation pattern and/or other data corresponding to an energy applicator or an applicator array. For example, a physician may determine that a substantially spherical ablation pattern is necessary. The physician may activate a âselect ablation shapeâ mode of operation for electrosurgical power generating source 26, preview an energy applicator array by reviewing graphically and textually presented data, optionally, or alternatively, manipulate a graphic image by, for example, rotating the image, and select an energy applicator or an applicator array, based upon displayed parameters. The selected energy applicator(s) may then be electrically coupled to the electrosurgical power generating source 26 for use therewith. Electrosurgical power generating source 26 may include an actuator 87. Actuator 87 may be any suitable actuator, e.g., a footswitch, a handswitch, an orally-activated switch (e.g., a bite-activated switch and/or a breath-actuated switch), and the like. Actuator 87 may be operably coupled to the processor 82 by a cable connection (e.g., 83 shown in FIG. 18) or a wireless connection, e.g., a radiofrequency or infrared link. In an embodiment, a physician may input via the user interface 25 an applicator array parameter to cause the electrosurgical power generating source 26 to present one or more electromagnetic energy delivery devices corresponding thereto and/or one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies for use therewith. For example, a physician may require a 3.0 cmÃ3.0 cmÃ3.0 cm ablation pattern, and provide an input corresponding thereto. In response, the electrosurgical power generating source 26 may preview a corresponding subset of available electromagnetic energy delivery devices that match or correlate to the inputted parameter. In an embodiment, a physician may input via the user interface 25 a selected power output, and the electrosurgical system 1800 controls the energy applicator 12 to adjust the ablation field radiating about at least a portion of the energy applicator 12 into tissue based on at least one electrical signal transmitted by the one or more microwave field-detecting needle assemblies.
