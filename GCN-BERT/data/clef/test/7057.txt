1.6: 5-bromo-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione
326 mg (2.4 mmol) of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and 462 mg (2.4 mmol) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride are added to a solution of 500 mg (2 mmol) of (5-bromo-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-acetic acid in 12 ml of dimethylformamide. After stirring at room temperature for 10 minutes, 560 mg (2.4 mmol) of 3-piperidin-4-yl-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinazolin-2-one is added. The reaction mixture is then stirred at room temperature for 18 hours and then hydrolysed with an aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and diluted with 20 ml of ethyl acetate. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate and then with n-butanol. The organic phases are combined, washed once with saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue is taken up in heptane/ethyl acetate mixture, then filtered and dried under nitrogen. 900 mg (97%) of 5-bromo-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of an off-white solid.
