Step 1. 6,8-Dibromo-3-iodoimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine
To a solution of 6,8-dibromoimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine (0.50 g, 1.8 mmol) (Combi-Blocks, OR-7964) in DMF (12 mL) was added N-iodosuccinimide (0.45 g, 2.0 mmol). The reaction mixture was then heated at 60Â° C. for 15.5 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting solid was taken up into DCM. The organic layer was washed sequentially with water and sat. Na2S2O3 (aq). The organic layer was then dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to afford the title compound as a light yellow solid (0.64 g, 88%). LCMS for C6H3Br2IN3 (M+H)+: calculated m/z=401.8, 403.8, 405.8; found 401.8, 403.7, 405.6.
