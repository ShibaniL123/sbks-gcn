Example 7: Preparation of sodium (2S,5R)-2-((2-ethyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl) carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl sulfate (Compound 7)
(1) Preparation of tert-butyl (2-ethyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carbamate
Tert-butyl 2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-ylcarbamate (900 mg, 4.24 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (30 mL), acetaldehyde aqueous solution (mass fraction 40%, 2.3 g, 52.21 mmol) and acetic acid (127 mg, 2.11 mmol) were added at 0°C. . Sodium cyanoborohydride (534 mg, 8.50 mmol) was added in batches. After addition of materials, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 2h, diluted by adding dichloromethane (30 mL), washed with water (30 mL×3), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated in vacuum, the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane : methanol =50:1∼10:1) to obtain the title compound as a white solid (800 mg, yield 78.6%).
