TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is related to the preparation of intermediates useful in the manufacturing of (+)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(methanesulfonyl-methyl-amino)-pyrimidin-5-yl]-(3R,5S)-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid of the Formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, new, industrially advantageous modifications of the intermediates and use thereof. (+)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(methanesulfonyl-methyl-amino)-pyrimidin-5-yl]-(3R,5S)-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid of the Formula (I) is a pharmaceutically active ingredient known under the International Nonpropriatary Name rosuvastatin, which is effective in regulating the lipid metabolism. Rosuvastatin exerts its activity by inhibiting the enzyme 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl-coenzim-A reductase present in the liver, thus reducing the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis and the cholesterol concentration of blood plasma. Rosuvastatin of the Formula (I)—especially in the form of salts—is used in the medicine for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and atherosclerosis. More specifically, the present invention is related to an industrially applicable method for the preparation of rosuvastatin tert-butylammonium (TBA) salt of the Formula (III) in high purity. According to the method of the present invention, rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) is obtained by reacting tert-butylamine directly with a starting material selected from rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa), rosuvastatin ethylester of the Formula (IIb) or rosuvastatin t-butylester of the Formula (IIIc) in a suitable solvent. We have found that a particularly suitable starting material is a crystalline form of a rosuvastatin ester of the general Formula (II). In the Formula (II), R represents methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl. According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for the preparation of new crystalline forms of rosuvastatain methylester of the Formula (IIa) and rosuvastatin ethylester of the Formula (IIb) According to a still further aspect of the present invention, there are provided crystalline Form II and amorphous modifications of rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III), which are useful as reference substances during the analytical testing of the morphology of rosuvastatin TBA salt. BACKGROUND ART (+)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(methansulfonyl-methyl-amino)-pyrimidin-5-yl]-(3R,5S)-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid (rosuvastatin) of the Formula (I) is a known compound which has been disclosed for the first time in European Patent No. 521471 in the form of the free acid and as certain pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g. rosuvastatin calcium salt of the Formula (IV) as well as ammonium salts thereof. Rosuvastatin zinc (2:1) salt of the Formula (V) has been disclosed in Published Hungarian Patent Application P0600293 and in Published International Patent Application WO 2007119085. According to the method of preparation disclosed in European Patent No. 521471, preparation of a rosuvastatin salt is carried out by saponifying a rosuvastatin ester of the general Formula (II) and if desired, the rosuvastatin salt thus obtained is transformed into rosuvastatin acid and either the directly obtained rosuvastatin salt or rosuvastatin free acid of the Formula (I) is transformed into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, preferably into the calcium salt of the Formula (IV). Rosuvastatin is an easily decomposing, light-sensitive compound, therefore further methods have been developed with the aim to obtain rosuvastatin in higher purity. The chemical purity of pharmaceutically active ingredients is regulated by strict official norms issued by health authorities. Thus, according to the ICH Guidelines—even in the case of impurities with known chemical structure—the maximum limit concentration thereof is fixed at 0.1% in a pharmaceutically active ingredient. Salts of rosuvastatin formed with amines are widely used during the manufacture of rosuvastatin salts used in the production of finished dosage forms. According to the state of the art, such salts of rosuvastatin formed with amines are transformed into a pharmaceutically acceptable alkali metal or alkali earth metal salts of rosuvastatin by setting the amine free from the salt using a stronger base and the thus obtained salt, which is usually an alkali metal salt, is subsequently transformed into the salt form used as active ingredient in the finished dosage form. Published International Patent Application WO 01060804 is related to crystalline ammonium, methylammonium, ethylammonium, diethanolammonium, tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylammonium, benzylammonium or 4-methoxybenzyl-ammonium salts, which are transformed into amorphous rosuvastatin calcium salt by converting a rosuvastatin ammonium salt mentioned above into rosuvastatin sodium salt using aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, which is converted in the second step into rosuvastatin calcium (2:1) salt of the Formula (IV), and filtering the product from the aqueous solution. The purity of the product has not been disclosed. Published International Patent Application WO 2008038132 discloses salts of rosuvastatin formed with diamines. Among the salts, only the dibenzylethylenediamine salt is characterized by X-ray diffraction data. The salts are prepared starting from rosuvastatin of the Formula (I) or rosuvastatin sodium salt. Published International Patent Application WO 2008067440 discloses a method for the preparation of rosuvastatin calcium salt of the Formula (IV) starting from the dehydroabiethylamine salt of rosuvastatin through rosuvastatin sodium salt, in an aqueous solvent. The purity of the rosuvastatin calcium salt disclosed in an example is 99.80% as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and contains the diastereomer impurity in 0.14% concentration, which is very close to the limit concentration (0.15%). Direct transformation of several rosuvastatin ammonium salts into rosuvastatin calcium salt (wherein no rosuvastatin sodium salt is produced) has been disclosed in Published International Patent Applications WO 2004014872 and WO 2006136407. The reactions are carried out in an aqueous solvent. Published International Patent Application WO 2004014872 is related to a method for preparation of rosuvastatin calcium salt with specific operating parameters, which results in the enhancement of the filtering efficiency during the isolation of the salt precipitating from water. In the method, rosuvastatin calcium salt of the Formula (IV) is obtained from certain water-soluble rosuvastatin ammonium salts (ammonium, tris-hydroxymethyl-methylammonium, methylammonium salts). Published International Patent Application WO 2005077916 is related to crystalline and amorphous rosuvastatin cyclohexyl-, dicyclohexyl-, isopropyl-, diisopropyl- and (S)-1-methylbenzyl-ammonium salts. These salts are prepared by reacting a rosuvastatin ester, rosuvastatin or rosuvastatin lactone with the corresponding amine and purified by recrystallization. However, no method parameters have been disclosed or exemplified for the method using ester or lactone as starting materials, therefore neither the yield of the method nor the quality of the product can not be determined. The salts mentioned above are transformed into rosuvastatin calcium of the Formula (IV) by converting first the rosuvastatin ammonium salt into rosuvastatin lactone of the Formula (VI) which is subsequently converted into the sodium salt and by reacting with a calcium ion source in aqueous medium and filtering, amorphous rosuvastatin calcium salt having its purity in excess of 99.5% (as determined by HPLC) is obtained. Nevertheless, the concentration of the diastereomeric impurity is high: using the method disclosed in the above-mentioned application, the concentration of the diastereomeric impurity can not be decreased below approx. 0.25%. Such an active ingredient, however, does not comply with internationally accepted ICH Guidelines, since the limit concentration for impurities having known chemical structure is thereby set to 0.1% for each impurity. A further disadvantage of the method is that the ammonium salt is transformed into the final product through further intermediates in multiple steps. In Published International Patent Application WO 2005051921, a method for purification of rosuvastatin calcium salt through the crystalline isopropyl- or cyclohexylammonium salt has been disclosed. Rosuvastatin calcium salt is first transformed into rosuvastatin of the Formula (I), which is thereafter converted into rosuvastatin isopropyl- or cyclohexylammonium salt using ethylacetate as solvent. Subsequently the ammonium salt is transformed into sodium salt in aqueous medium and the sodium salt is transformed into rosuvastatin calcium salt (2:1) of the Formula (I) in an aqueous solvent. The yield of the reaction is 73.6% without disclosing the purity. There are several methods in the state of the art relating to the hydrolysis of rosuvastatin esters with bases. In most cases, esters are saponified with aqueous alkali metal hydroxides yielding rosuvastatin alkali metal salts. Ammonium salts are prepared by converting a rosuvastatin alkali metal or alkali earth metal salt into rosuvastatin acid of the Formula (I) which is subsequently reacted with an amine yielding ammonium salt. Thus, for example, hydrolysis of rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa) with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution has been disclosed in Published International Patent Applications WO 2003097614, WO 2004052867 and WO 2006017357. According to Published International Patent Application WO 2007000121, hydrolysis of rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa) is carried out using lithium hydroxide. Saponification of Rosuvastatin Tert-Butylester of the Formula (IIc) by sodium hydroxide has been disclosed in Published International Patent Applications WO 2006100689, WO 2006106526, WO 2007099561 and WO 2007125547. A method for the hydrolysis of rosuvastatin ethylester of the Formula (IIb) using sodium hydroxide has been disclosed in Published International Patent Application WO 2007000121. In Published International Patent Application WO 2005023778, a method for preparation of rosuvastatin calcium salt starting from rosuvastatin alkylester has been described. The ester is hydrolyzed in an alcoholic solution with sodium-potassium- or barium-hydroxide, the solution is evaporated, the salt is dissolved in water, the aqueous solution is extracted with an organic solvent and after removing the organic solvent and adding a calcium source, the calcium salt is formed which is isolated by filtration. However, the method has been demonstrated by an example of saponifying rosuvastatin tert-butyltester of the Formula (IIc) with sodium hydroxide only. According to Published International Patent Application WO 2006136408, amorphous rosuvastatin calcium salt can be prepared by hydrolyzing a rosuvastatin C1-C5 alkylester with a base in an aprotic solvent or in a mixture of an aprotic solvent and water. Thereafter a calcium salt is added to the reaction mixture and the amorphous rosuvastatin calcium salt is isolated. In the examples, sodium hydroxide is used as a base. Crystalline forms of each rosuvastatin ethyl-isopropyl- and tert-butylester of rosuvastatin corresponding to Formulae (IIa), (IIb) and (IIc), respectively, have been disclosed in Published International Patent Application WO 2005042522. Crystalline modifications of the esters have been characterized by powder X-ray diffractograms. Crystalline rosuvastatin ethylester of the Formula (IIb) has been prepared by purifying the crude product on silica gel using a solvent mixture of toluene-hexane (1:1). The solution is filtered and evaporated. In the present specification, crystalline form of rosuvastatin ethylester of the Formula (IIb) prepared according to the method of the above-mentioned application is referred to as Form I rosuvastatin ethylester. Published International Patent Application WO 2009019211 discloses a crystalline modification of rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa) characterized by powder X-ray diffractogram. In the present specification, this modification is referred to as Form I rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa). Crystalline Form I rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa) is prepared according to the state of the art by purifying crude methylester by preparative HPLC using diisopropylether-isopropanol (98.5:1.5) solvent mixture. The collected main fraction is concentrated by evaporation, subsequently crystallized at −20° C. for 3 days and filtered. The filtrate is evaporated to dryness, thus crystalline Form I rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa) is obtained. Published International Patent Application WO 2006136407 is related to a method for preparation of amorphous rosuvastatin calcium, which comprises hydrolysing a rosuvastatin C1-C5 alkylester in the presence of an organic nitrogen base (an amine, quaternary ammonium hydroxide, amidine, guanidine etc.), in a mixture of water and an aprotic organic solvent. The salt formed with the corresponding nitrogen base thus obtained is transformed into rosuvastatin calcium salt by the addition of a calcium cation source. In the application, several rosuvastatin ammonium salt are claimed, e.g. pyrrollidinium, piperidinium, morpholinium, adamantylammonium, N,N-dicyclohexylammonium, N-methyl-cyclohexylammonium, tert-octylammonium. The method for preparation of some representatives of the ammonium salts has been disclosed, including rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III). Nevertheless the salt has not been characterized by analytical data. According to the disclosed methods, rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) has not been used as starting material for the preparation of rosuvastatin calcium salt of the Formula (IV). The hydrolysis of the rosuvastatin esters is carried out in an autoclave in aqueous solution at a temperature around 100° C. However, the quality of the ammonium salts thus obtained is inferior to those obtained by other methods known from the state of the art. Depending on the quality of the amine used in the reaction, the purity of the product lies between 94.5 and 98.9% as determined by HPLC. In the case when tert-butylamine is used, the purity of the product is 98.4%. This purity can not be improved later since during the transformation of rosuvastatin TBA salt into rosuvastatin calcium salt of the Formula (IV), further purification can not be achieved and the state of the art is silent about a method for purification of rosuvastatin calcium salt of the Formula (IV) or rosuvastatin zinc salt of the Formula (V). In Published International Patent Applications WO 2007125547 and WO 2008044243, methods have been disclosed for the preparation of rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) starting from rosuvastatin sodium salt and for preparation of rosuvastatin calcium salt of the Formula (IV) starting from rosuvastatin TBA salt using the sodium salt as an intermediate. The method is carried out in an aqueous solution followed by the isolation of the calcium salt by filtration. The purity of the product has not been disclosed. In International Patent Application WO 2007125547, a crystalline modification of rosuvastatin TBA salt has been disclosed and characterized by powder X-ray diffractogram. In the same application, rosuvastatin butyl-, isobutyl- and sec-butylammonium salts are also claimed. In Published International Patent Application WO 2010082072, methods have been disclosed for the transformation of rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) into rosuvastatin calcium (2:1) salt of the Formula (IV) and into rosuvastatin zinc (2:1) salt of the Formula (V) using ethylacetate-water biphasic solvent system. The objective of our research-development work was to provide a method suitable for the industrial manufacturing of rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) in high purity complying with the internationally accepted guidelines by transforming a rosuvastatin ester of the general Formula (II) wherein R represents methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl, using mild reaction conditions in water or in a mixture of water and a water-miscible organic solvent. Our objective has been solved according to the present invention. It is well known from the state of the art that most of the methods starting from a rosuvastatin ester proceeds through the rosuvastatin sodium salt intermediate and rosuvastatin calcium directly obtained by this method is of unsatisfactory quality. Thus the sodium salt is often transformed into an ammonium salt suitable for recrystallization. Thus, the necessary purification may be achieved by the recrystallization of the ammonium salt intermediate. Subsequently the ammonium salt is converted back to rosuvastatin sodium salt using sodium hydroxide, which upon reacting with a calcium cation source, yields rosuvastatin calcium salt. Such processes include several unnecessary steps, which—even by the most careful implementation—most probably result in the increase of the concentration of the impurities due to the easily decomposing character and light sensitivity of rosuvastatin. Thus, usually neither the final product, nor the ammonium salt prepared in this way satisfies the regulations set forth by the ICH Guideline relating to impurities. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is specifically related to an industrially applicable method for the preparation of rosuvastatin tert-butylammonium (TBA) salt of the Formula (III) in high purity. According to the method, a starting material selected from rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa), rosuvastatin ethylester of the Formula (IIb) or rosuvastatin tert-butylester of the Formula (IIc) is directly reacted in a suitable solvent with tert-butylamine and the thus formed rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) is isolated. It has been found that the most advantageously, a crystalline ester of the general Formula (II), wherein R represents methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl, can be used as starting material. According to a further aspect of the present invention, there are provided methods for the preparation of new crystalline forms of rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa) and rosuvastatin ethylester of the Formula (IIb). According to a still further method of the present invention, there are provided methods for the preparation of crystalline Form II and amorphous rosuvastatin TBA salt, which are suitable as reference material in the analytical testing related to the morphology of rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III). In the method according to the present invention, a rosuvastatin ester of the general Formula (II), wherein the meaning of R is methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl, preferably a crystalline form thereof, the most preferably crystalline Form II rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa) or crystalline Form II rosuvastatin ethylester of the Formula (IIb) are reacted in water, in a polar solvent or in a mixture thereof with aqueous tert-butylamine solution, water is removed from the product and the thus obtained rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) is isolated. Under the reaction conditions applied, it was expected that the starting material or the product is at least partially converted into rosuvastatin tert-butylamide of the Formula (VII) which has to be removed in a separate purification step. As it is known from the state of the art, esters (in presence of an amine) or ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can easily transform into the corresponding amide upon heating. Such a side reaction, if present, would decrease the yield of the main reaction and would have result in a crystallizing impurity having high melting point which is difficult to remove from the rosuvastatin TBA product. Surprisingly, it has been found that no such byproduct has been formed in a detectable quantity, the yield of the reaction exceeded 90% and the purity of the TBA salt in several cases exceeded 99.9%. Manufacturing of a product is such high purity without applying any purification steps in itself is very surprising. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect, the present invention is related to a method form the preparation of rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III), which comprises reacting a rosuvastatin ester of the Formula (II), wherein R represents methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl in a polar solvent, preferably in water or in a mixture of water and a polar solvent such as water, methanol, acetonitrile, the most preferably in acetonitrile with 1.5 to 5 molar equivalents, preferably 2.0 molar equivalents of tert-butylamine at a temperature between 10 C and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at a temperature between 25 to 50 C for 24 to 72 hours, preferably for about 40 hours. Subsequently, after the removal of water, the product is filtered and washed, thus rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) is obtained in good yield and high purity. In this way, by reacting a rosuvastatin ester with tert-butylamine directly, rosuvastatin TBA salt having 99.8-99.9% purity (as determined by HPLC) can be produced, which is devoid of any impurity exceeding the limit concentration of 0.1% set forth by international guidelines and compendia. The product is of outstanding purity which does not necessitates further recrystallization. Rosuvastatin TBA salt obtained according to the method of the present invention is directly suitable for the preparation of rosuvastatin calcium (2:1) salt or rosuvastatin zinc (2:1) salt in anhydrous or hydrated form, having 99.8-99.9% purity (as determined by HPLC). A further advantage of the method according to the present invention resides in that it can be carried out in a single reactor and extraction or chromatography steps requiring large amounts of organic solvent as well as manpower are not necessary. By carrying out the method according to the present invention, we have found that in most cases, a rosuvastatin TBA product of the Formula (III) having uniform morphology can be obtained. However, in the case when the solution of the final product of the Formula (III) is subjected to fractionated crystallization, a new, essentially homogeneous crystalline form of rosuvastatin TBA salt could be obtained. According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided crystalline Form II rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III). Characteristic powder X-ray reflections of the new crystalline Form II rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) are summarized in Table 1. The X-ray diffractogram of the same substance is shown in FIG. 1.

Such characteristics are closely related to the morphology of the drug substance or that of an intermediate thereto. Thus analytical testing of the morphology of the product is an important analytical task. Crystalline Form II rosuvastatin TBA salt can be used as an analytical reference material during the testing of rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III). Similarly, in order to support analytical testing, the amorphous form of rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) has been prepared. According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided amorphous rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III). Amorphous rosuvastatin TBA salt can be prepared by dissolving rosuvastatin TBA salt in a saturated aliphatic alcohol having one to four carbon atoms, preferably in methanol, the solvent is removed and the solid residue is dried at room temperature for at least one day. Powder X-ray diffractogram of amorphous rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) is shown in FIG. 2. Measuring conditions are the same as described above in connection with crystalline Form II rosuvastatin TBA salt. Rosuvastatin TBA salts of different morphology, such as crystalline Form I rosuvastatin TBA salt known from the state of the art, the new crystalline Form II rosuvastatin TBA salt according to the present invention and new amorphous rosuvastatin TBA salt as disclosed above, can be used as reference materials during the analytical testing and crystallographic studies related to rosuvastatin TBA salts of the Formula (III). According to the state of the art, it is known that pretreatment of samples prior to powder X-ray diffractometric analysis, such as pulverization can significant influence powder X-ray measurement results. Therefore no pretreatment has been applied before the testing. The person skilled in the art identifies the solid state morphology of a known chemical compound by its powder X-ray diffractogram and specific signals (reflexions) thereof (diffraction angle, relative intensity) by comparing the diffractogram to that of a reference material or to specific signals obtained from the measurement of such material. Such identification is especially important in case of compound having multiple solid state (amorphous and crystalline) forms. Crystalline Form II rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) exhibits the X-ray diffraction signal of greatest intensity at 18.651° 2. X-ray diffraction signals of crystalline Form II rosuvastatin TBA salt exceeding 50% relative intensity are the following: 15.803 and 18.651° (2). X-ray diffraction signals of crystalline Form II rosuvastatin salt of the Formula (III) exceeding 25% relative intensity are the following: 11.282, 15.803, 18.651, 19.050, 19.832 és 20.512° (2). According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for the preparation of crystalline Form II rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III), which comprises suspending a rosuvastatin ester of the general Formula (II), wherein R represents methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl, preferably in crystalline form in water, an aqueous solution containing an equimolar amount of tert-butylamine is added thereto at a temperature between 10 and 50 C, preferably at 25 C, optionally the addition of tert-butylamine is repeated within a period of 2 to 24 hours in one to five times in a way that at each subsequent addition, an aqueous solution containing 0.1 to 0.5, preferably 0.2 molar equivalents of tert-butylamine are added, the precipitated solids are removed after 72 to 96 hours and the thus obtained crystalline Form II rosuvastatin TBA salt of the Formula (III) is isolated after further 48-72 hours of crystallization. According to a more advantageous embodiment of the present invention a crystalline rosuvastatin ester of the Formula (II), wherein the meaning of R is as defined above, is used for the preparation of rosuvastatin TBA salt. The most preferably, a high purity crystalline ester of the Formula (II) is used. It has been found that the purity of the starting material is significantly influenced by its solid state and morphology. Furthermore, we have also established that the quality of the starting material has great effect on the purity of the final product. According to this embodiment, the new crystalline Form II rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa) or the new crystalline Form II rosuvastatin ethylester of the Formula (IIb) are especially advantageous starting materials. Esters of the Formula (II), wherein the meaning R is as defined above, are available commercially as impure (90-95% chemical purity), sometimes coloured, viscous oily liquids or in somewhat greater purity, as solids. For example, in European Patent No. 521471, rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa) is characterized as a viscous oil, which is purified before further use by column chromatography. According to a method disclosed in Published International Patent Application WO 2009019211, rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa) is prepared by subjecting crude rosuvastatin methylester to preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. According to the method disclosed in Published International Patent Application WO 2005042522, crystalline rosuvastatin ethylester of the Formula (IIb) is obtained by adsorptive purification on silica gel using hexane-toluene solvent mixture. During our experiments directed to the further purification of commercial rosuvastatin methylester and ethylester, we have surprisingly found that a new crystalline form of each ester can be prepared. By crystallizing rosuvastatin methylester from different solvents and solvent mixtures, we obtained the new crystalline form which indicates the higher stability of said new form. The fact that rosuvastatin esters of the Formulae (IIa) and (IIb) can be prepared in crystalline form without using a chromatographic or adsorptive methods is very surprising in itself. Crystalline forms of the compounds of the Formulae (IIa) and (IIb) are especially suitable starting materials for the preparation of rosuvastatin TBA salt. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided new crystalline Form II rosuvastatin methylester of the Formula (IIa).
