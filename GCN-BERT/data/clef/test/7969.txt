Composition comprising a non-ionic surfactant and an ionic polymer The invention relates to compositions, preferably solid compositions, comprising a non-ionic surfactant and an ionic polymer, methods for their preparation and their use. The compositions are useful inter alia as flocculation auxiliaries for solid-liquid separation processes, for example in sludge dewatering/waste water purification and as retention aids or other additives in paper manufacture. In the practice of solid-liquid separation the object is to achieve, by addition of flocculating auxiliaries, the best possible result in terms of the parameters dry substance of the solid and clarity of the filtrate, or in other words to bring about the most complete separation possible of solid from the liquid phase. Sludge dewatering on a chamber-type filter or in a decanter centrifuge can be regarded as examples of the importance of these parameters. Since the dried sludge must be transported and often put to beneficial use by thermal processing, the highest possible content of solid (dry-substance content) is desired. In addition, the separated filtrate must be delivered to disposal. The quality and simplicity of such disposal increase as the clarity of the filtrate increases, or in other words as the content of unflocculated solids remaining in the filtrate becomes lower. In such a case the filtrate can be discharged directly from a clarifying plant to the environment, and does not have to pass through the clarifying plant once again. Flocculating auxiliaries are produced in the form of powdery granules or water-in-water polymer dispersions or water-in-oil emulsions, and prior to their use are added in dilute aqueous solutions to the medium to be flocculated. Powdery granules are preferred, since they can be transported more inexpensively by virtue of their almost anhydrous condition and, as in the water-in-oil emulsions, do not contain any oil or solvent constituents that are insoluble in water. Typically, solutions having a concentration of 0.01 to 0.5 wt.-% are prepared. It is known from the prior art to employ water-in-water polymer dispersions containing ionic polyacrylamide derivatives as flocculating agents in solid/liquid separation processes. For example, WO 2002/046275, WO 2006/072294 and WO 2006/072295 describe the use of cationic water-in-water polymer dispersions as flocculation auxiliaries in solid sedimentation processes. The use of anionic water-in-water polymer dispersions as flocculating agents in such applications is known from WO 2005/092954. Powdery, water-soluble, cationic polymers for solid-liquid separation are known from WO 2005/023885. However, in case of using solid forms, which are often preferred over the liquid ones due to lower transportation costs and higher storage stability, some of these show a clear tendency to cause or stabilize foam during their make-down or in the application processes, such as solid/liquid separation processes. These foams can slow the processes down, disturb them or even make the use of powdered flocculation auxiliaries impossible. Therefore, in a lot of these applications an additional defoaming aid has to be used. These additional defoaming aids typically consist predominantly of mineral oils and require an additional storage. Mixing such defoaming agent with a solid flocculating auxiliary impairs the flowability of the flocculating auxiliary and may even result in a complete loss of flowability. Consequently, these defoaming agents have to be introduced into the centrate (filtrate) via additional dosing points, e.g. an additional pump. The necessity to use an additional defoaming agent is thus always associated with costly installation efforts and considerable additional costs. Flocculating auxiliaries that are commercially available in form of water-in-oil emulsions do not have such disadvantages since they already contain such mineral oil with defoaming properties. However, these water-in-oil emulsions have the disadvantage that they do not contain the flocculating auxiliary in concentrated form. Therefore, much larger volumes have to be prepared, transported and stored. Further, the storage stability of such water-in-oil polymer emulsions is typically reduced compared to solid forms of polymeric flocculating auxiliaries. Anti-foaming agents based on oil-in-water emulsions are known from patent applications US 2006/0111453 and US 2010/0212847. US 5,684,107 discloses the manufacture of agglomerated polymer particles of finely divided polymers by azeotropic dewatering of water-in-oil emulsions of polymers in the presence of polyalkylene glycols. The polymers are preferably cross-linked by adding considerable amounts of cross-linkers, preferably 50 to 5,000 ppm. A skilled artisan is fully aware that under the conditions of azeotropic dewatering (which is generally a thermal process) in presence of polyalkylene glycol crosslinking and thereby gel formation takes place with anionic polymers such as polyacrylic acid, as the polyalkylene glycol reacts with the acid groups at the polymer backbone. Thus, even if no cross-linker is added to the reaction mixtures, the anionic products according to US 5,684,107 exhibit a comparatively high degree of branching and cross-linking. Furthermore, the agglomerated polymer particles always contain residual amounts of oil, which is detrimental for various reasons, in particular ecological reasons. It is an object of the invention to provide compositions containing ionic polymeric flocculation auxiliaries which have advantages compared to the compositions of the prior art. In particular, the handling and metering of the composition should be simple and the composition should not have any negative influences on the performance or application properties of flocculating auxiliary contained therein. This object has been achieved by the subject-matter of the patent claims. It has been surprisingly found that suitable non-ionic surfactants with anti-foaming properties and suitable ionic polymer flocculating auxiliaries can be combined in form of a composition, preferably a solid composition, without impairing the performance of the individual components. Further, it has been surprisingly found that the relative weight ratio of the non-ionic surfactant to the ionic polymer can be specifically tailored so that foaming can be efficiently suppressed at minimized consumption of non-ionic surfactant. Thus, separate addition and individual dose adjustment of non-ionic surfactant is not necessary when utilizing the composition according to the invention. Figure 1 shows the foam height versus time as determined in a comparative foaming test between the composition according to the invention (Example) and a commercial flocculating auxiliary (comparative Example). Figure 2 shows the gel formation of various polymer compositions in dependence on the content of cross-linkers.

In this regard, when cross-linking is achieved after polymerization of the monomers, i.e. by adding further reactants in a polymer-analogous reaction, the amount of said reactants is at most 50 ppm relative to the total content of monomers in the monomer composition. When the monomer composition contains cross-linking monomers or when after polymerization of the monomers further reactants are added in order to achieve cross-linking in a polymer-analogous reaction, the content of said cross-linking monomers and reactants, respectively, is preferably at most 45 ppm, more preferably at most 40 ppm, still more preferably at most 40 ppm, yet more preferably at most 35 ppm, even more preferably at most 30 ppm, most preferably at most 25 ppm, and in particular at most 20 ppm, relative to the total content of monomers in the monomer composition.

Preferably, the ionic polymer can serve as coagulant and/or flocculating auxiliary. Chemical coagulation, the alteration of suspended and colloidal particles so they adhere to each other, is one type of chemical treatment process. Coagulation is a process that causes the neutralization of charges or a reduction of the repulsion forces between particles.

Preferably, the process comprises the step of (i) subjecting an aqueous reaction mixture comprising a) one or more non-ionic ethylenically unsaturated monomers, and/or b) one or more cationic ethylenically unsaturated monomers, and/or c) one or more anionic ethylenically unsaturated monomers, d) optionally the ionic polymeric dispersant, and ℮) optionally the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2, to a radical polymerization by adiabatic gel polymerization, wherein the ionic polymeric dispersant, the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2 and the non-ionic, anionic and cationic ethylenically unsaturated monomers are defined as described above. Preferably, the content of the ionic polymeric dispersant, if present, is within the range of from 0.1 to 40 wt.-%, more preferably 0.5 to 35 wt.-%, still more preferably 1.0 to 30 wt.-%, yet more preferably 5.0 to 25 wt.-%, most preferably 10 to 20 wt.-% and in particular 12 to 16 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the aqueous reaction mixture. In a preferred embodiment, the reaction mixture of step (i) comprises the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2. In another preferred embodiment, the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2 is added at a later stage of the process. The aqueous reaction mixture comprises water, preferably deionized water. The water content may vary from 0.01 to 99.99 wt.-%. In a preferred embodiment, the water content is within the range of from 10 to 90 wt.-%, more preferably 15 to 85 wt.-%, still more preferably 20 to 80 wt.-%, yet more preferably 25 to 75 wt.-%, most preferably 30 to 70 wt.-% and in particular 35 to 65 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the aqueous reaction mixture. In another preferred embodiment, the water content is within the range of from 35 to 90 wt.-%, more preferably 40 to 85 wt.-%, still more preferably 45 to 80 wt.-%, yet more preferably 50 to 75 wt.-%, most preferably 55 to 70 wt.-% and in particular 60 to 66 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the aqueous reaction mixture. Preferably, the aqueous reaction mixture does not contain branching agents and cross-linkers (particularly monomers having more than one radically polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated moiety) such that the resulting cationic copolymer is substantially free of branching. For example, the aqueous reaction mixture preferably does not contain any monomers having more than one radically polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated moiety. Therefore, the ionic copolymer that is polymerized from the monomer composition, optionally in the presence of the ionic polymeric dispersant, is preferably substantially un-branched and substantially un-crosslinked. If the water-soluble ionic polymer is derived from a monomer composition comprising minor amounts of cross-linking monomers, a preferred cross-linking monomer is allylacrylamide. According to the invention, the complete absence of cross-linking monomers is principally desirable, as cross-linking of the polymers tends to deteriorate the overall performance of the composition according to the invention. However, mainly due to side reactions in the course of monomer synthesis, in the production of technical grade monomer products the formation of minor amounts of cross-linking monomers cannot always be completely suppressed. However, this does not mean that branching reactions that might take place e.g. due to radical termination reactions are completely excluded from the invention. Rather, as such branching reactions always take place to a certain extent, they are generally tolerable. For example, when the propagating radical chain abstracts a proton from a polymer backbone, polymerization of this chain is terminated but a new radical is generated which in turn might originate a new propagating radical, thereby leading to a branching point. However, branching and cross-linking to an extent that can be observed in the course of (thermal) azeotropic dewatering of anionic polymers in the presence of polyethylene glycol should avoided. The degree of branching and cross-linking, respectively, can be routinely determined by measuring the gel content of a standardized aqueous solution of the water-soluble ionic polymer. For the purpose of the specification, the gel content is preferably determined according to the following procedure: 0,8 g of the sample is weighed to an accuracy of 0.01 g into a 1000 ml beaker. 800 ml of tap water (19-25 °C) is added in such a way that no lumps are formed. Then, the solution is stirred for 30, 60, or 90 minutes, depending on the formula instruction, with a finger stirrer at 300 r.p.m. (dimensions of the finger stirrer: material: stainless steel, diameter: 8 mm, offset: 15 mm (measured from center to center), length of the lower part of the shank: 65 mm, length of the section that provides the offset when measured in parallel to said lower part of the shank: 25 mm, overall length: 240 mm. When stirring is finished, the solution is placed on a standard sieve (315 4m DIN-ISO 3310/1-200x50mm) and once it has passed through the sieve, this is rinsed through five times with one liter of fresh water from the beaker. After the rinsing water has passed through the sieve any residual water under the sieve is wiped off with the rubber policeman. Using the rubber policeman and the powder funnel the residue is transferred to a 100 ml measuring cylinder and the volume determined according to the following formula: ml/L (undissolved gel component) = Volume (residue) χ 1,25. Preferably, the water-soluble ionic polymer that is optionally admixed with an ionic polymeric dispersion has a gel content (undissolved gel component) of at most 50 ml/L, more preferably at most 45 ml/L, still more preferably at most 40 ml/L, yet more preferably at most 35 ml/L, even more preferably at most 30 ml/L, most preferably at most 25 ml/L, and in particular at most 20 ml/L, according to the above procedure. Usually, before the free radical polymerization is initiated, the aqueous reaction mixture is prepared from its components. The preparation of aqueous reaction mixtures is known to the skilled person. The components may be added simultaneously or consecutively. The components may be added by conventional means, e.g. by pouring or dropping liquids, by dosing powders, and the like. Preferably, an aqueous dispersion is prepared comprising the ionic ethylenically unsaturated monomer, the non-ionic ethylenically unsaturated monomer and optionally the ionic polymeric dispersant, preferably in homogeneous aqueous solution. Further components may be added to the aqueous dispersion, such as chelating agents, buffers (acids and/or bases), branching agents, cross-linkers, chain transfer agents, and the like. Suitable branching agents, cross-linkers and chain transfer agents are known to the skilled person. Preferably, however, no branching agents, cross-linkers or chain transfer agents are added. In a preferred embodiment, the pH of the aqueous dispersion is adjusted to a value within the range of from 1.0 to 5.0, more preferably 1.5 to 4.5, still more preferably 2.0 to 4.0, and most preferably 2.5 to 3.5. In another preferred embodiment, the pH is adjusted to a value within the range of from 2.0 to 6.0, more preferably 2.5 to 5.5, and most preferably 3.0 to 5.0. The pH value may be adjusted by means of suitable acids and bases, respectively. Preferred acids are organic acids and mineral acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. Preferably, the aqueous dispersion is vigorously stirred by means of, e.g., a conventional spiral-stirrer, high-speed mixer, homogenizer, and the like. In principle, it is not necessary that the entire amount of each component is initially present when the aqueous reaction mixture is prepared. Alternatively, partial dispersion of the monomers can be effected at the beginning of the polymerization, the remainder of the monomers being added as metered portions or as a continuous feed distributed over the entire course of polymerization. For example, only a certain portion of a particular component, e.g., only 70 wt.-% of the non-ionic ethylenically unsaturated monomer may be initially employed, and thereafter, possibly in the course of the polymerization reaction, the remainder of said particular component, e.g., the residual 30 wt.-% of the non-ionic ethylenically unsaturated monomer, is employed. In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, before the aqueous reaction mixture is subjected to a radical polymerization, a water-soluble salt is added in quantities of 0.1 to 5.0 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the aqueous reaction mixture. Ammonium, alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium and/or magnesium salts, can be used as water-soluble salts. Such salts can be salts of an inorganic acid or of an organic acid, preferably of an organic carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, phosphonic acid, or of a mineral acid. The water-soluble salts are preferably salts of an aliphatic or aromatic mono-, di-, polycarboxylic acid, of a hydroxycarboxylic acid, preferably of acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, adipic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid or benzoic acid, or sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid. Very particularly preferably, sodium chloride, ammonium sulfate and/or sodium sulfate are used as water-soluble salts. The salts can be added before, during or after polymerization, polymerization preferably being carried out in the presence of a water-soluble salt. After the aqueous reaction mixture has been prepared, it is subjected to a radical polymerization by adiabatic gel polymerization reaction, i.e., polymerization of the monomer composition containing the non-ionic ethylenically unsaturated monomers and/or the cationic ethylenically unsaturated monomers, and/or the non-ionic ethylenically unsaturated monomers, optionally in the presence of the ionic polymeric dispersant and optionally in presence of the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2 is initiated, thereby yielding a solid gel comprising the ionic polymer, the ionic polymeric dispersant, if present during the polymerization process, and the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2, if present during the polymerization process. The skilled person knows how to radically polymerize monomers in an aqueous reaction mixture. Preferably, the start temperature for the polymerization is adjusted to a range of from -10 to 25 °C, more preferably a range of from 0 °C to 15 °C. Higher start temperatures lead to polymer gels which are too soft to be further processed in subsequent size-reduction and drying processes. Preferably, oxygen is purged from the aqueous reaction mixture by an inert gas, such as nitrogen. The polymerization is preferably carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, e.g. under a nitrogen atmosphere. Typically, the exothermic polymerization reaction of the monomers is started by addition of a polymerization initiator. Radicals may be formed, e.g., upon thermally induced or photochemically induced homolysis of single bonds or redox reactions. Examples of suitable water-soluble initiators include, e.g., 2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, 4,4'-azobis-(4-cyanopentanoic acid), 2,2'-azobis(2-(-imidazolin-2-yl)propane dihydrochloride or redox systems such as ammonium persulfate/ferric sulfate. Oil-soluble initiators include, e.g., dibenzoyl peroxide, dilauryl peroxide or tert-butyl peroxide, or azo compounds such as 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile, dimethyl 2,2'-azobisisobutyrate and 2,2'azobis-(4-methoxy-2, 4-dimethylvaleronitrile). The initiators may be used either individually or in combinations and generally in an amount of about 0.015 to 0.5wt.-% of the total weight of the aqueous reaction mixture. The skilled person principally knows how to modify the amount and type of the initiator in order to modify the properties of the resultant polymer product, e.g., its average molecular weight. Preferably, azo compounds such as 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2'-azobis(2-(-imidazolin-2-yl)propane dihydrochloride, 2,2'-azobis(2-aminopropane) dihydrochloride or preferably potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, optionally in combination with a reducing agent, e.g. an amine or sodium sulfite, are used as radical initiators. The amount of initiator, relative to the monomers to be polymerized, generally ranges from 10"3 to 1.0 wt.-%, preferably from 10"2 to 0.1 wt.-%. The initiators can be added completely or also only in part at the beginning of the polymerization, with subsequent apportioning of the residual amount over the entire course of polymerization. In a preferred embodiment, the polymerization is initiated by means of a sodiumperoxodisulfate and, after reaching the maximum temperature, continued with an azo initiator, such as 2,2'-azobis(2-(-imidazolin-2-yl)propane dihydrochloride. At the end of the polymerization, a redox initiator system is preferably added in order to reduce the content of residual monomers. In a preferred embodiment, once the exothermic polymerization reaction is complete, i.e. generally after the temperature maximum, the content of residual monomers is further reduced by subsequent addition of redox initiator. In another preferred embodiment, the monomer composition and optionally the ionic polymeric dispersant is apportioned into the polymerization reactor during polymerization. In general, a portion, e.g. 10 to 20% of the monomers and optionally the ionic polymeric dispersant, is initially introduced. Following initiation of polymerization, the above-mentioned apportioning is effected, optionally accompanied by further apportioning of polymerization initiator. In addition, it is also possible to remove water during polymerization and optionally to add further cationic polymeric dispersant. The polymerization may be carried out in aqueous solution, in batches in a polymerization vessel or continuously on an endless belt, as is described, for example, in DE 3544770. Preferably, the polymerization reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure without a supply of external heat. Through the exothermal reaction, heating of the polymerization mixture takes place with formation of a polymer gel. Preferably, the reaction mixture reaches a maximal end temperature within the range of from 50 to 150 °C, depending on the content of polymerisable material and on the decomposition kinetics of the initiator used. Polymerization times are the same as those conventionally used in the art, generally 1.5 to 18 hours and preferably 2 to 6 hours, although as little as one-half hour could be used. However, attempting more rapid polymerization over a shorter period of time creates problems with removing heat. In this regard it is greatly preferred that the polymerization medium be stirred well or otherwise agitated during the polymerization. Polymerization conversion or the end of polymerization can easily be detected by determining the content of residual monomers. Methods for this purpose are familiar to those skilled in the art (e.g. HPLC). After the temperature maximum has been reached, the solid polymer gel being formed can be further processed immediately or else after a holding time. Preferably the polymer gel will be further processed immediately after the maximum temperature has been reached. Following polymerization, it also can be advantageous to cool down the aqueous reaction mixture before optionally adding further additives, such as salts or acids, to the dispersion, preferably with stirring. To reduce the residual monomer content, it is also possible to increase the temperature during the course of the polymerization. Alternatively, it is also possible to use additional initiators during and at the end of the polymerization and/or residual monomer destructors. Residual monomer destructors within the meaning of the invention are substances that modify polymerizable monomers by means of a chemical reaction in such a way that they are no longer polymerizable, such that within the meaning of the invention they are no longer monomers. Substances that react with the double bond present in the monomers and/or substances that can initiate a more extensive polymerization can be used for this purpose. As residual monomer destructors that react with the double bond, reducing agents can for example be used, preferably substances from the group of acids and neutral salts of acids derived from sulfur having an oxidation number lower than VI, preferably sodium dithionite, sodium thiosulfate, sodium sulfite or sodium disulfite, and/or substances having a hydrogen sulfide group, preferably sodium hydrogen sulfide or compounds from the group of thiols, preferably mercaptoethanol, dodecyl mercaptan, thiopropionic acid or salts of thiopropionic acid or thiopropanesulphonic acid or salts of thiopropanesulphonic acid, and/or substances from the group of amines, preferably from the group of amines with low volatility, preferably diisopropanolamine or aminoethyl ethanolamine, and/or substances from the group comprising Bunte salts, formamidine sulfinic acid, sulfur dioxide, aqueous and organic solutions of sulfur dioxide or thio urea. Preferably, at the end of the polymerization the remaining aqueous composition has a residual content of cationic ethylenically unsaturated monomers of at most 5,000 ppm, more preferably at most 2,500 ppm, still more preferably at most 1,000 ppm, yet more preferably at most 800 ppm, most preferably at most 600 ppm an in particular at most 400 ppm. Preferably, at the end of the polymerization the remaining aqueous composition has a residual content of anionic ethylenically unsaturated monomers of at most 5,000 ppm, more preferably at most 2,500 ppm, still more preferably at most 1,000 ppm, yet more preferably at most 800 ppm, most preferably at most 600 ppm an in particular at most 400 ppm. Preferably, at the end of the polymerization the remaining aqueous composition has a residual content of non-ionic ethylenically unsaturated monomers of at most 5,000 ppm, more preferably at most 2,500 ppm, still more preferably at most 1,000 ppm, yet more preferably at most 800 ppm, most preferably at most 600 ppm an in particular at most 400 ppm. Preferably, the composition according to the invention contains no substantial amounts of organic solvents and volatile organic constituents (VOC). Preferably, the composition does not contain any organic solvents or volatile organic constituents (VOC), or at most 50 ppm, preferably at most 45 ppm, more preferably at most 40 ppm, still more preferably 35 ppm, yet more preferably at most 30 ppm, even more preferably at most 25 ppm, most preferably at most 20 ppm, and in particular at most 15 ppm. The content of organic solvents and volatile organic constituents (VOC) can be measured by routine procedures. Preferably, the composition according to the invention contains no substantial amounts of oil. Preferably, the composition does not contain any oil, or at most 50 ppm, preferably at most 45 ppm, more preferably at most 40 ppm, still more preferably 35 ppm, yet more preferably at most 30 ppm, even more preferably at most 25 ppm, most preferably at most 20 ppm, and in particular at most 15 ppm. The content of oil can be measured by routine procedures. Preferably, the process according to which the composition according to the invention is obtainable further comprises the step of (ii) crushing or chopping the gel obtained from step (i); Step (ii) may be carried out in standard industrial apparatus. If the polymerization is carried out in presence of an ionic polymeric dispersant as defined supra, the weight ratio of the ionic polymeric dispersant to the ionic polymer is decisive for further processing of the polymer gel. If the ratio exceeds the value of 0.01:10 to 1:4, there are formed very soft gels, which immediately coalesce once again after size reduction and make drying on the industrial scale almost impossible. Ionic polymers with ionic monomer proportions of greater than 60 wt % are particularly critical as regards further processing. In those cases, it has often proved effective to adjust the weight ratio of the ionic polymeric dispersant to the ionic polymer to 0.2:10 to <1:10. In a preferred embodiment, in step (ii) a separating and/or anti-sticking agent is added to the gel obtained from step (i). The separating and/or anti-sticking agent can be any surfactant with separating and/or anti-sticking properties. Preferably, the separating and/or anti-sticking agent is selected from the group consisting of fatty acid dialcohol amides, quaternized reaction products of fatty acids and alcohol amines and fatty acid amidoalkyl betaines. Typically, for the size-reduction of a gel formed by a gel polymerization process the addition of such separating and/or anti-sticking agent is required. It has been surprisingly found that by the presence of the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2, the amount of separating and/or anti-sticking agent can be reduced or completely omitted. If a separating and/or anti-sticking agent is used, it is added in such an amount that the flowability of the final composition obtained after step (iv) is not impaired and the foaming behavior of the final composition when used as a flocculant in solid-liquid separation is not negatively affected. Preferably, the separating and/or anti-sticking agent does not have any defoaming or anti-foaming properties. In another preferred embodiment, step (ii) is performed without the addition of a separating and/or anti-sticking agent. After size reduction, the gel is preferably dried at a temperature within the range of from 70°C to 150°C, i.e. the process preferably further comprises the step of (iii) drying the product obtained from step (ii) at a temperature within the range of from 70 to 150 °C. More preferably, step (iii) is performed at a temperature within the range of from 80 °C to 120 °C, in particularly within the range of from 90 °C to 110 °C. Preferably, the drying is performed in batches in a circulating-air drying oven. In the continuous version, drying takes place in the same temperature ranges, for example on a belt dryer or in a fluidized-bed dryer. After drying, the product preferably has a moisture content of less than or equal to 12 wt.-%, and particularly preferably of less than or equal to 10 wt.-%. After drying, the product is preferably ground to the desired particle-size fraction, i.e. the process preferably further comprises the step of (iv) grinding the product obtained from step (iii). Preferably, at least 90 wt % of the ground product should have a size not exceeding 2.0 mm, more preferably a size not exceeding 1.5 mm, in order to achieve rapid dissolution of the product. Preferably, fine fractions smaller than 0.1 mm should amount to less than 10 wt %, preferably less than 5 wt %. Preferably, the particles after drying have a form factor of at most 50%, more preferably at most 45%, still more preferably at most 40%, yet more preferably at most 35%, even more preferably at most 30%, most preferably at most 35%, and in particular at most 30%. The form factor can be routinely determined according to the following procedure: Preferably, when the composition according to the invention is provided in particulate form, the polymer particles are characterized by a specific particle shape and spherical particle content. The non-spherical parameter (NSP) is a measure of the degree of deviation from a spherical shape. When determining the non-spherical parameter (NSP) of the particles according to the invention, e.g. by means of a PartAn 2001 L (photo-optical image analyzing system), the non-spherical parameter (NSP) is preferably at least 20%, more preferably at least 30%, still more preferably at least 40%, yet more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, most preferably at least 70%, and in particular at least 75%. Preferably, the process further comprises the step of (ν) adding the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2. Step (ν) may be performed at any time during the process according which the composition according to the invention can be obtained, i.e. before step (i), after step (iv) or at any time in between. In a preferred embodiment, step (ν) is performed before step (i), i.e. the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2 is added to the aqueous reaction mixture comprising the monomer composition and is present during the polymerization reaction. In another preferred embodiment, step (ν) performed after step (iv), i.e. the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2is added to the ground product obtained from step (iv). In still another preferred embodiment, step (ν) is performed between steps (i) and (iv), i.e. the non-ionic surfactant R1-0-A-0-R2 is added to the gel obtained from step (i), to the crushed or chopped gel obtained from step (ii) or to the dried product obtained from step (iii). In yet another preferred embodiment, the amount of non-ionic surfactant divided into at least two portions, which independently of one another may be added at any time of the process. For example, one portion is added before step (i) and the other portion is added to the ground product obtained from step (iv). A further aspect of the invention relates to a process for manufacturing the composition according to the invention comprising steps (i), optionally (ii), optionally (iii), optionally (iv) and (ν) as defined supra. Preferably, the process comprises all of the steps (i)-(v). The composition according to the invention is useful as additive in solid/liquid separation processes, e.g., as flocculating auxiliary in the sedimentation, flotation or filtration of solids; as thickener; or as a retention agent or drainage aid, e.g., in papermaking/ retention in paper; or in sludge dewatering in sewage plants. A further aspect of the invention relates to the use of the composition according to the invention as flocculating auxiliary for purifying waste water or conditioning potable water. A further aspect of the invention relates to a process for treating waste water, drinking water or process water, the process comprising the steps of (a) optionally, especially when the composition according to the invention is provided in solid form, preparing a water-in-water polymer dispersion by mixing the composition according to the invention with water, and (b) flocculating an aqueous suspension or slurry, preferably sewage sludge, by introducing the water-in-water polymer dispersion, and (c) dewatering the aqueous suspension or slurry, preferably by using a decanter, chamber filter press or belt filter press. Preferably, the composition according to the invention is used in a dosage within the range of from 20 g/m3to 1000 g/m3, more preferably within the range of from 60 g/m3to 500 g/m3, still most preferably within the range of from 80 g/m3 to 450 g/m3, most preferably within the range of from 100 g/m3 to 400 g/m3, and in particular within the range of from 120 g/m3 to 350 g/m3, based on the amount of the aqueous suspension or slurry. A further aspect of the invention relates to the use of the composition according to the invention as additive, preferably as retention agent or drainage aid, in the manufacture of paper, paperboard or cardboard. A further aspect of the invention relates to a process for the manufacture of paper, paperboard or cardboard, the process comprising the steps of (a) optionally, especially when the composition according to the invention is provided in solid form, preparing a water-in-water polymer dispersion by mixing the composition according to the invention with water, and (b) adding the water-in-water polymer dispersion to an aqueous cellulosic suspension. Preferably, the composition according to the invention is employed in a dosage within the range of from 20 g/m3 to 1000 g/m3, more preferably within the range of from 60 g/m3 to 500 g/m3, still most preferably within the range of from 80 g/m3 to 450 g/m3, most preferably within the range of from 100 g/m3 to 400 g/m3, and in particular within the range of from 120 g/m3 to 350 g/m3, based on the amount of the aqueous cellulosic suspension. As all preferred embodiments of the composition according to the invention also apply to the uses according to the invention as well as to the processes according to the invention, these preferred embodiments are not mentioned again. EXAMPLES The following examples further illustrate the invention but are not to be construed as limiting its scope. EXAMPLE 1 Lab tests were performed by dewatering sludge samples (obtained from central wastewater treatment plant in Dusseldorf-llverich) by the sieve method described here below. Two flocculation auxiliaries were tested: Comparative flocculation auxiliary: copolymer of acrylamide with cationic acrylic acid derivative Inventive flocculation auxiliary: copolymer of acrylamide with cationic acrylic acid derivative and 0.5% non-ionic surfactant (reaction product of a C12-C18 fatty alcohol, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide) applied in the preparation process of the copolymer before the drying process. In a 600 ml beaker, a 0.1 wt.-% aqueous solution of the respective flocculating auxiliary (500 ± 10 ml) was prepared and sheared by means of a dispersing device "Ultra Turrax Τ 25 N" with dispersing tool "S 25 Ν - 18 G" (Janke & Kunkel) at a rotation speed of 24,000 min"1. Then, a sample of sludge (500 ± 10 ml) was conditioned with a portion of the sheared flocculating auxiliary solution (flocculating auxiliary dose: 200 g(weight solids)/m3) using a four-blade stainless stirrer (RW 20 DZM Janke & Kunkel) at 1000 ± 20 min'1 for 10 ± 0.5 seconds and dewatered by a drainage screen (stainless steel, 150 χ 50 mm; 200 pm mesh). The resulting filtrate (centrate) was subjected to a foaming test. Foam test conditions: 300 ml filtrate, 100 I air/hour, foam height in mm The resulting foam heights over time periods are depicted in the table here below and in Figure 1: time (min.) foam height (mm) comp. Example Example 1 1 266 212 2 212 158 3 187 133 4 173 122 5 176 119 6 176 115 7 176 108 A clearly reduced foaming tendency could be seen in the lab trial. EXAMPLES 2-4 The inventive flocculation auxiliary of Example 1 was tested at three different wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Two plants are purely municipal sewage treatment plants, each with a design capacity of 137,000 and 120,000 population equivalents. The third treatment plant has a design capacity of 1,200 000 population equivalent. All water treatment plants described here set to a degradation of organic constituents in the sludge digestion tanks. Then the sludge is drained with the addition of powdered flocculating auxiliaries using modern high performance decanters. EXAMPLE 2 Design capacity 1.2 million inhabitants. In this new facility the inflowing water consists of 75% from industry and 25% from municipal sources. The biological process is divided here into high-and low-load range. The resulting excess sludge is thickened using a decanter and then fed to the digester. The sludge is dewatered by a total of three Sharpless decanters at a rotation speed of 2700 min"1. During the operational testing centrifuge 1 was charged with 40 m3/h sludge. The dosing of the flocculating auxiliary was 265 g/m3. The resulting centrate was fed into a process water tank and after nitrogen elimination and neutralization re-added to the inflow of sewage. Since development of foam would be disruptive approximately 16 l/day of defoamer (suspension of polyethylene wax in mineral oil) are dosed into the centrate, normally. Comparative operational tests were conducted with the comparative flocculation auxiliary and the inventive flocculation auxiliary according to Example 1. By adding an additional defoamer (suspension of polyethylene wax in mineral oil), the foam height was kept constant. 1) Pump for defoamer when using the comparative flocculation auxiliary: 50 strokes / minute 2) Pump for defoamer when using the inventive flocculation auxiliary: 25 strokes / minute In summary, the dosage of additional defoamer could be cut by half. EXAMPLE 3 Design capacity 137 000 inhabitants. Mainly municipal wastewater is processed in this treatment plant. The biological return sludge is thickened using a decanter and then fed to the digester. After a digestion period of 20 days 220 g/m3 flocculating auxiliary are dosed and dehydrated with a modern high performance decanter of the company KHD. As no antifoam agent is used in this application the formation of foam in the centrate limits the volume flow of the machine. Foam formation is a massive handicap. With no or less foam development, the flow rate and, therefore, productivity can be increased. 1) Maximum throughput when using the comparative flocculation auxiliary: 27 m3/h 2) Maximum throughput when using the inventive flocculation auxiliaryExample 1: 32 m3 / h. I.e. 19% performance increase. The higher mud flow shortens the run time of the decanter and, thus, saves energy and costs. EXAMPLE 4 Design capacity 120 000 inhabitants This sewage plant is processing almost exclusively domestic sewage. The sludge is processed in a biology stage, thickened with a flotation and fed to the digester. After an appropriate residence time, the sludge is dewatered. Then 163 g / m3 flocculating auxiliaries is added and the dewatering is performed by using a modern high performance decanter with a throughput of 43 m3/h.

EXAMPLES 5 TO 11 In a series of experiments (polymerization reactions of acrylamide and various ionic comonomers) the influence of cross-linkers (contained in the starting material and/or specifically added in predetermined amounts) on undesirable gel formation was studied. In Examples 5, 8, 10 and 11, a technical grade of cationic monomer was employed that already contained about 30 ppm cross-linking monomer (N-allylacrylamide, ΝΑΑ). In Example 9, an analytical grade of the same cationic monomer was employed that did not contain any detectable amount of cross-linker. In Examples 5, 6 and 7, N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) was separately added as cross-linker in various predetermined amounts. In Examples 8 and 9, N-allylacrylamid (ΝΑΑ) was separately added as cross-linker in various predetermined amounts.

By using a PartAn 2001 L, a photo-optical image analyzing system, the non-spherical parameter (NSP), a shape factor of these polymer particles was measured. These measurements showed for the particles of the polymer of Example 5 a deviation of the NSP from an ideal spherical shape of approx. 14% and for the polymers of Example 7 and 9 a deviation of approximately 76%. When comparing the above experimental data with the teaching of US 5,684,107, the following can be concluded: When employing the polymer compositions according to the invention in the intended application, products having an excellent water-solubility are needed, as insoluble parts do not provide any functional properties or even cause problems in these applications. In nearly all intended applications some kind of flocculation or coagulation mechanism is the key to product performance. Only water-soluble polyelectrolytes possess the ability to interact with material in the intended way. Further, insoluble parts (gel particles) may lead to clogging of protective filters or, e.g. in paper production, may lead to holes or even breaks of the paper sheets which is a very cost intensive problem for paper manufacturers. Therefore, for the purposes of the polymer dispersions according to the invention, it is always desirable to produce polymer products (e.g. powders) that easily dissolve and form smooth solutions without or only with a very low formation of insoluble parts. To prove the good solubility of the products according to the invention, solubility tests and gelling tests have been conducted. Based upon long application experience, in standard applications the gel/insoluble limit should certainly not exceed 30 ml/L (of. values in the 3rd column in above table). For other applications like e.g. paper production, even more demanding limits are set, e.g. below 10 ml/L, below 5 ml/L or even below 1 ml/L. As evidenced by the above experimental data, gel contents below these limits can only be achieved at very low contents or in absence of cross-linkers. At contents of cross-linker amounting to 50 ppm or more according to US 5,684,107, the resultant products are wide out of specification. The exemplified compositions of US 5,684,107 contain such inacceptable high quantities of cross-linkers. Further, if no cross-linkers would be added to the reaction mixtures according to US 5,684,107, the subsequent azeotropic (in general thermal) dewatering step in presence of polyalkylene glycol would lead to crosslinking/gel formation with acid groups connected to the polymer backbone. Furthermore, the polymer compositions according to the invention are preferably only waterbased in contrast to the products in US 5,684,107 which are water-in-oil based polymers. Further, the polymer compositions according to the invention do not need to be dewatered and other solvents or oils do not need to be removed. Thus, the polymer compositions according to the invention are easier to manufacture and have a better ecological profile. 1.
