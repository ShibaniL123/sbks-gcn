Intermediate 18: 2-(Pyridin-2-yl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine
To a solution of 5-(trifluoromethyl)-3a,7a-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine (Intermediate 8, 100 mg, 0.53 mmol) in DMSO (4 mL) was added K2CO3 (295 mg, 2.14 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at rt for 30 min. 2-fluoropyridine (0.14 mL, 1.6 mmol) was then added, and the reaction was heated at 80Â° C. for 2 days. After cooling to rt, the mixture was filtered, and to the filtrate were added DCM and 5% aqueous citric acid. The organic layer was then separated and washed successively washed with 5% aqueous citric acid, sat. aq. NaHCO3, and brine. After drying over Na2SO4 and filtering, the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2; 0-100% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the title compound (19 mg, 13% yield).
