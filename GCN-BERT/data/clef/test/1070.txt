(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(2-methy lthiazol-5-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
2-methyl-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)thiazole
5-bromo-2-methylthiazole 10a (2 g, 11.23 mmol) was dissolved in 70 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and 5.6 mL of a solution of 2.4 M n-butyllithium was added at -78Â°C. After the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (2.5 g, 13.44 mmol) was added. The reaction was stirred for 1.5 hours, then stopped. The reaction solution was warmed up to room temperature, then 10 mL of a mixture of saturated ammonium chloride solution and water (V/V = 1: 1) were added to quench the reaction. Then, 50 mL of ethyl acetate was added, and two phases were separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with 30 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound 2-methyl-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)thiazole 10b (1.6 g, yield 64%) as a light yellow oil.
