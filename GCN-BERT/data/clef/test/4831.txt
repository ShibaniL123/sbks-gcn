Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to the field of detecting and measuring impacts to the head and resulting neurological impairment. More particularly, it concerns measuring the differential acceleration (including for example, a linear, angular, and/or rotational differential acceleration) of the head in comparison to the body to detect potential traumatic brain injury. 2. Description of Related Art Traumatic brain injury is caused by head trauma after impact. The rapid acceleration or deceleration of the brain within the cranial vault, or absorption of a shock wave can cause the brain to impact the inside of the skull. These forces can also cause stretching and/or shearing of axonal tracts (tearing of connections between neuronal cells), which can trigger secondary neurodegenerative damage and maladaptive plasticity leading to chronic neurological dysfunction. The physiological effects resulting from these injuries can be detected immediately in some cases, but can also develop slowly over minutes, hours, weeks, months, or even years post-injury. Pathological processes can evolve slowly, making them difficult to detect in stages when interventions are most effective. Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries (mTBI) can result in post-concussion syndrome and impairment in cognitive domains such as memory, processing speed, affect, impulse control, prediction/planning and other executive functions as measured by traditional neuropsychological instruments. Acute physiological changes (e.g. inflammation) following mTBI may also make an individual more susceptible to a subsequent impact due to poor judgment or slower reaction times. These repeated impacts may, in turn, make an individual more susceptible to chronic neurological injury. Therapeutic options may be developed to prevent chronic neurological damage if we can identify reliable quantitative markers (changes in physiological and neurobehavioral responses) associated with mTBI. These quantitative measures could also be used in conjunction with acceleration measurements to identify those types of impacts associated with acute and chronic neurological injury. However, there are currently no devices capable of accurately and objectively tracking subtle changes in neurophysiological status associated with either mTBI or systems that accurately measure angular acceleration of the head correlated with mTBI biomarkers. There is a critical need to identify a sensitive, rapid, easily obtainable biomarker to serve as an objective indicator of when an athlete or soldier should be withheld from the field and when they can return in order to avoid permanent traumatic brain injury. Repeated concussive and even sub-clinical exposures to head trauma can produce a spectrum of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), resulting in stress points of damage in the brain, ranging in severity from mild cognitive impairment to severe dementia, disinhibited violent outbursts, motor dysfunction, reduced quality of life and even suicide. There are currently several wearable accelerometer units available commercially. While each provides an indication of linear acceleration/deceleration, none of the existing devices alone accurately measures differential acceleration of the head relative to the body, which may in fact be a key component in the production of concussion symptoms, as linear measures alone have shown limited correlations with concussion symptoms. It is likely that movement of the head relative to the body is a critical factor in traumatic brain injuries due to the tethering forces of the spine on the brain.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The following drawings form part of the present specification and are included to further demonstrate certain aspects of the present invention. Embodiments of the invention may be better understood by reference to one or more of these drawings in combination with the detailed description of specific embodiments presented herein. FIG. 1—An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure installed on a user's head. FIG. 2—The exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1 in isolation. DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are designed to detect physiological changes associated with mild traumatic brain injuries and quantify accelerations associated with mTBI. One exemplary embodiment (also referred to herein as the “Second Derivative System”) monitors and integrates directional and differential acceleration data from an unobtrusive, player-worn sensor. Embodiments of the invention may include web based applications that will allow the data to be collected and analyzed in real time. The Second Derivative System may predict the long-term neurological consequences of mTBI. The device may prove useful in providing the information needed to develop strategies, rules, and interventions to minimize neurological damage due to head impacts. Second Derivative Sensor Exemplary embodiments of the device include a series of two or three accelerometers unobtrusively positioned on the head and neck to accurately measure and record linear and angular rotation. In certain embodiments, the accelerometers are mounted in a flexible or compliant frame forming a lightweight device, positioned at the ends and middle of the device with a separation of one to two inches between sensors. This configuration permits measurement of head rotation in all three axes relative to the body/neck. It is believed that it is the relative motion between various brain structures and the spine that results in neural injury following impacts. Impacts that result in angular accelerations of the head are most likely to cause tearing of axons and blood vessels due to the tensile forces generated. The compliant frame conforms to the head, running from the temple, behind the ear and down around the neck (as shown in FIG. 1). It is attached to the skin using non-irritating adhesive at the ends of the arms and at the center behind the ear. The arms are thin and detachable, and can be bent in multiple configurations to custom fit the individual. Second Derivative System Design In exemplary embodiments, the Second Derivative System uses a low-power TI MSP430 processor, 200G 3 axis accelerometers from Analog Devices, with signal conditioning circuitry, 2MB of FRAM for low-power memory storage, and a small, rechargeable Lithium Ion battery. The MSP430 processor has a real-time clock and USB control for programing and battery recharging. FIG. 1 depicts the Second Derivative System worn on a user's head. A first accelerometer 102 is located on the user's forehead or temple above the right eye. A second accelerometer 104 is located on the back of the user's neck. A third accelerometer 106 is located above or behind the user's right ear. A “S” shaped, flexible or compliant frame 100 is coupled to the first accelerometer 102, second accelerometer 104, and third accelerometer 106. In preferred embodiments, the frame 100 is made of plastic and/or rubber. Disposed within the frame 100 is a processor that is electrically coupled to the first accelerometer 102, second accelerometer 104, and third accelerometer 106. The processor receives signals from each accelerometer indicating the magnitude and direction of acceleration. To determine the differential acceleration of the head in comparison to the neck, the processor calculates the difference in acceleration of the first and third accelerometers when compared to the second accelerometer. A calculated differential acceleration that exceeds a certain predetermined threshold may be indicative of the wearer sustaining a mild traumatic brain injury. In some embodiments, if the calculated differential acceleration exceeds a predetermined threshold, the processor may cause a light emitting diode (LED) to blink red. In other embodiments, if the calculated differential acceleration exceeds a predetermined threshold, the processor may cause a speaker near the wearer's ear to emit a warning tone. In other embodiments, if the calculated differential acceleration exceeds a predetermined threshold, the processor may cause a buzzer to vibrate against the wearer's skin. In preferred embodiments, the Second Derivative System includes memory for storing differential acceleration data. In some embodiments, the memory stores the magnitude of the greatest calculated differential acceleration and time stamp. In other embodiments, the memory stores the magnitude of each calculated differential acceleration that exceeds the predetermined threshold. In some embodiments, the memory further stores the elapsed time between events that exceed the predetermined acceleration threshold. The Second Derivative System may include a temperature sensor for measuring the body temperature of the wearer. It is theorized that higher body temperature and increased blood pressure during strenuous activity will cause increased cranial pressure and make an individual more susceptible to head injuries. The processor may use the wearer's body temperature, along with the calculated differential acceleration data, to predict the occurrence of a mild traumatic brain injury. In some embodiments, the memory further stores the wearer's body temperature at the time of the event that exceeded the predetermined acceleration threshold. A magnetic switch (magnetically actuated) on the device may be used to turn the sensor on and off as well as to allow an athletic trainer to check the subject for symptoms related to registered impacts. In some embodiments, swiping a magnet over the device for 4 seconds turns the device on and off. In some embodiments, swiping a magnet over the device for less than 1 second will cause the sensor to report if an impact or rotation threshold was exceeded. An LED may blink red if a predetermined impact threshold was exceeded or blink green if impact thresholds were not exceeded. In other embodiments, a small speaker will emit a warning tone in the user's ear if a predetermined impact threshold was exceeded. In other embodiments, a vibrating buzzer will alert the user if a predetermined impact threshold was exceeded. The device can be programed with multiple impact thresholds based on linear and/or angular acceleration measures. In some embodiments, the Second Derivative System is paired with a base station. The Second Derivative System and the base station both have metal electrical contacts. When the Second Derivative System is placed in the base station, the device's battery is recharged through the electrical contacts. In some embodiments, the base station downloads data from the device's memory through the electrical contacts. The base station may also upload firmware updates to the device through the electrical contacts. The electrical contacts may consist of a mini USB connector, micro USB connector, FireWire connector, or a proprietary connector. The base station may be a tablet, laptop computer, smartphone, or other computing device. The Second Derivative System may include a wireless transmitter to transmit accelerometer and/or temperature sensor data. The data may be transmitted to a holder, tablet, laptop computer, smartphone, or other computing device. In preferred embodiments, the data is encrypted prior to transmission. The wireless transmission may use the 802.11, Bluetooth, or IrDA protocols.
