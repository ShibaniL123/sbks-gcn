The aging of skin may be understood as being influenced by intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include natural changes to the skin, which are regulated by genetic makeup. Extrinsic factors include exogenous influences such as UV damage, environmental factors, and the like. Aging of the skin can adversely affect elasticity and strength of the skin through changes in the two main constituents of the dermal extracellular matrix, the fibrous proteins collagen and elastin. For example, elastin is a large fibrous protein formed by the crosslinking of elastin precursor protein molecules (e.g., tropoelastin) into spiral filaments. Collagen, more ubiquitous than elastin, is another fibrous protein that forms the structural network of skin. Certain agents are known for their beneficial effect of inhibiting the degradation of crosslinked elastin. For example, it is known that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of enzymes that are able to break down the macromolecules in the extracellular matrix, play an important role in elastin degradation. A number of plant extracts have been described as inhibitors of various MMPs. For instance, J. L. Lamaison describes the inhibition of elastase (porcine pancreatic elastase) with extracts of plants selected from the rosaceae group and attributes the inhibition to the tannins they contain. Ann. Pharmaceutiques Francaises 1990, 48, 335-340. M. Herrmann et al. disclose that SymMatrix, a hydroalcoholic blackberry leaf extract, exhibits the MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 inhibitory activity. SOFW Journal (2006), 132(4), 42-46. In addition, certain natural or synthetic compounds are known for the beneficial effect of promoting the production of elastin precursor and/or promoting the formation of collagen. For example, retinoids up-regulate elastin production in fibroblasts. Liu et al., Am J Physiol 1993 Nov; 265(5 Pt l):L430-437. Retinoids are also known to nmmntp rnllqaprt fnrmqtinn Furthermore, it has also been noted that certain agents positively influence the cross-linking of tropoelastin. For example, lysyl oxidase serves as a crosslinking enzyme and an element of the scaffold to ensure spatially defined deposition of elastin. Liu et al., Nature Genetics (2004), 36(2), 178-182. Valerie et al. disclose a dill extract that induces the lysyl oxidase (LOXL) gene expression, which is responsible for elastin cross-linking in adults. Experimental Dermatology (2006), 15(8), 574-81. Additionally, currant, cardamon, black radish, box holly, Asea foetida gum, ethyl hexenoate, methyl butyrate, and ethyl decadienoate are disclosed as promoters of LOXL gene expression. GB 2,438,999. Thus, numerous pathways and agents have been proposed to positively influence elastin and collagen, and skin-properties related thereto. However, the inventors have recognized a need for new agents and combinations of agents that can further positively influence either elastin or collagen, or preferably both. The inventors have now surprisingly discovered surprising benefits of a particular class of anti-inflammatory compounds, agents that inhibit the cell transcription factor nuclear kappa-B (NFkB). The inventors have found that while NFicB-inhibitors do not themselves necessarily enhance tropoelastin activity, when NFicB-inhibitors are combined with tropoelastin promoters, the resulting combinations exhibit a surprisingly large, unexpected and synergistic boost in tropoelastin promotion efficacy. Even more surprisingly, the inventors have identified certain compounds such as resorcinol derivatives, previously unknown for their inhibitory activity on NFkB, as particularly suitable to dramatically boost the tropoelastin activity of tropoelastin promoters.

FB293 are plated at a density of 5xl04 cells/mL in a suitable medium, e.g., Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1 0% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The FB293 cells are stimulated with 100 ng/mL of Tumor Necrosis Factor-a (TNFa, available from Sigma-Aldrich of St Louis, MO) in the presence of the test sample. Separately, a control sample is tested wherein no test sample is applied. Following a 24hour incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2, cells are lysed with 40 pi of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). A 20-pl aliquot of the lysate is assayed using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and counted for 10 s in a Lmax luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with the data represented as the relative light unit/second. Percent NFkB Inhibition of the test sample is calculated as: NFkB Inhibition = [1—( Lsampie / Lcontroi)] *100 where Lsampie is the luminescence of the sample and Lcontroi is the luminescence of the control.

TROPOELASTIN PROMOTER “Tropoelastin promoter,” as used herein, refers to a class of compounds that possess the biological activity of enhancing the production of tropoelastin. Tropoelastin promoters, according to the present invention, include all natural or synthetic compounds that are capable of enhancing the production of tropoelastin in the human body. Suitable tropoelastin promoters may be determined, for example, using the TROPOELASTIN PROMOTER ASSAY. The TROPOELASTIN PROMOTER ASSAY is performed as follows. Rat cardiac myoblasts H9C2 (which may be purchased, for example from ATCC of Manassas, VA) are used. Cultures are maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 1 00 units/ml penicillin, and 50 ug/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cell cultures are transiently transfected with the elastin promoter-luciferase reporter construct (Elp2.2, a 2.2 kb elastin promoter fragment from nt -2267 to nt +2, driving the firefly luciferase gene, which may be obtained from Promega, Madison Wis.). DNA is prepared by Qiagen Maxi columns (Qiagen Valencia, CA). In all transfections, a construct with the thymidine kinase promoter and the Renilla luciferase reporter gene (pRL-TK, Promega, Madison Wis.) is included as an internal control. Typically, cells grown in 48-well plates are transfected with 0.45 ug total DNA per well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). One day after transfection, cells are treated with agents at indicated concentrations for approximately 24 hours before they are lysed for luciferase assays, using Dual-Luciferase Reporter System from Promega (Madison, Wis.), following manufacturer's protocol. The firefly luciferase activity is measured first (representing elastin promoter activity), followed by the renilla luciferase (internal control), using luminometer LMAX, from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). The ratio of these two luciferase activities (RLU) is used to evaluate the Tropoelastin Promoter Activity. The tropoelastin promoter preferably has a Tropoelastin Promoter Activity of at least 1.1, preferably at least 1.25, more preferably at least 1.3, and most preferably at least 1.5, at at least one concentration in the range of 0.5 micrograms/milliliter to 2.5 milligrams per milliliter (on an actives basis), and preferably at at least one concentration in the range of 1.0 micrograms/milliliter to 2.5 milligrams per milliliter (on an actives basis). While it is contemplated that the NFKB-inhibitor and the tropoelastin promot may be one and the same compound, molecule, or functional group, in a preferred embodiment, the NFKB-inhibitor and the tropoelastin promoter are two separate and distinct compounds. Examples of suitable tropoelastin promoters include, but are not limited to, blackberry extracts, cotinus extracts, feverfew extracts, extracts of Phyllanthus nirur and bimetal complexes having copper and/or zinc constituents. The bimetal comple: having copper and/or zinc constituents may be, for example, copper-zinc citrate, copper-zinc oxalate, copper-zinc tartarate, copper-zinc malate, copper-zinc succinate, copper-zinc malonate, copper-zinc maleate, copper-zinc aspartate, copper-zinc glutamate, copper-zinc glutarate, copper-zinc fumarate, copper-zinc glucarate, copperzinc polyacrylic acid, copper-zinc adipate, copper-zinc pimelate, copper-zinc suberate, copper-zinc azealate, copper-zinc sebacate, copper-zinc dodecanoate, or combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the tropoelastin promoter is selected from blackberry extracts, cotinus extracts, feverfew extracts, and combinations thereof. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the tropoelastin promoter is selected from blackberry extracts, feverfew extracts, and combinations thereof. By “cotinus extract,” it is meant an extract of the leaves of "Cotinus coggygria, such as a water extract thereof, available from Bilkokoop of Sofia, Bulgaria. By “feverfew extract,” it is meant an extract of the plant "Tanacetum parihenium," such as may be produced according to the details set for the in US Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0196523, entitled, “PARTFIENOLIDE FREE BIOACTIVE INGREDIENTS FROM FEVERFEW (TANACETUM PARTHENIUM) AND PROCESSES FOR THEIR PRODUCTION.” One particularly suitable feverfew extract is commercially available as about 20% active feverfew, from Integrated Botanical Technologies of Ossining, NY. By “blackberry extract,” it is meant a blend of compounds isolated from the plant of the genus Rubus, and preferably Rubus fruticosus. In one embodiment, the compounds are isolated from the flowers of the plant. In a further embodiment, the compounds are isolated from dried flowers of the plant. Such compounds may be isolated from one or more part of the plant (e.g., the whole plant, flower, seed, root, rhizome, stem, fruit and/or leaf of the plant). In a preferred embodiment, the blackberry extract is a blackberry leaf extract. The extraction process may include by physically removing a piece of such plant, and, for example, grinding it. Further extraction of suitable compounds may £ be isolated from the plant by using extraction procedures well known in the art (e.g.. the use of organic solvents such as lower Ci-C8 alcohols, C|-C8 alkyl polyols, Ci-C8 alkyl ketones, Ci-C8 alkyl ethers, acetic acid CrCg alkyl esters, and chloroform, and inorganic solvents such as water, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, and inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide). For example, a blackberry leaf extract may be prepared by an extraction witl water, alcohols such as ethanol or combination thereof as the solvent. However, an extract produced with a solvent including both ethanol and water is preferred. The blackberry leaves are preferably dried prior to extraction. It is also preferable to use only the leaves of the blackberry plant for the extraction and not also other plant parts such as the fruit (berries) of the blackberry or its branches and roots. In one embodiment, the extraction process for the production of a blackberry leaf extract comprises the following steps: a) addition to blackberry leaves of an solvenl containing an alcohol selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, npropanol, isopropanol, b) Extraction of the blackberry leaves with the solvent for up to 72 hours. .. Detailed procedures for preparing a suitable blackberry leaf extract are disclosed in US Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0095719, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. One particularly suitable blackberry extract is produced by extracting the leaves of Rubus fruticosus with a mixture of water and ethanol compounded to an activity of about 5% to about 10%, with a maltodextrin matrix, commercially available from Symrise Inc. of Teterboro, NJ, and is sold under the name “SymMatrix.” Extracts of “Phyllanthus niruri” may be harvested and used as the whole plant, or optionally one or more parts of the plant (e.g., flower, seed, root, rhizome, stem, fruit and/or leaf of the plant) may be used. The Phyllanthus niruri plant or parts thereof may be finely divided, such as by grinding or milling, to a powder. A suitable milled form of Phyllanthus niruri is commercially available from Raintree Nutrition, Inc., of Carson City, Nevada. Preferably, a low molecular weight fraction of Phyllanthus niruri is usedTfor instance a fraction of Phyllanthus niruri substantially free of molecular species having a molecular weight of greater than about 100,000 daltons. Preferably such low molecular weight fraction is water extractable from the Phyllanthus niruri plant.

The compositions preferably include, on an active basis, from about 0.1% to about 10% c the tropoelastin promoters, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 5% of tropoelastin promoters, and most preferably from about 0.5% to about 2% of the tropoelastin promoters. The ratio of the concentration of NFicB-inhibitor to the concentration of the tropoelastin promoter in the composition may be varied according to the desired effectiveness of the composition in enhancing tropoelastin formation as well as for other reasons (e.g., composition stability, aesthetics, and the like). For example, the NFicB-inhibitor and tropoelastin promoter may be present in a concentration by weight ratio (which is determined by dividing the concentration by weight of the NFkBinhibitor by the concentration by weight of the tropoelastin promoter) of about 0.001 to about 100, preferably about 0.01 to about 10, more preferably about 0.02 to about 2.

The following specific embodiments are to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. The following non-limiting examples further illustrate the invention. The NFkB-INHIBITION TEST described above was performed on test samples of Bay 1 1-7082 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), Tetrahydrocurcuminoids CG (Sabinsa Corporation, Piscataway, NJ), as well as various concentrations of 4-hexylresorcinol. The results are shown in Table 1, in which NF-kB Gene Reporter Activation (Luminescence, L) is reported for the test samples and a control sample. Percent NFkB Inhibition is also reported.

Even more unexpectedly, 4-hexylresorcinol showed substantial NF-kB inhibition even at low concentrations. The NFkB-INHIBITION TEST described above was performed on a series of substituted resorcinols each having a concentration of 1 Oug/ml. The results are shown in Table 2. TABLE 2 4-Chlororesorcinol 2,6-Dichlororesorcinol Zearalanone Phenethylresorcinol 4-DodecylresorcinoI 4-Caproylresorcinol C-Undecylcalix[4] -resorcinarene (CH 2> (CH 2> *** HO | [ OH Me HO I I OH Me Me (CH 2 1 10 J| (CH2>10 HO OH 4.87% 3-Methoxyphenol IK) OMe 0% 2', 4'- Dihydroxypropiophenone L & -0.7% 2,4- DIHYDROXYCINNAMIC Acid -1.7% 1,3-Dimethoxybenzene MeO - .OMe -1.7% It can be seen from the data in Table 2 that superior NFkB inhibition is provid by substituted resorcinols containing only substituents free of phenyl functionalities, substituted resorcinols containing only substituents free of ketone functionalities, anc substituted resorcinols comprising a substituent having 5 to 1 1 carbon atoms. Example 3 The TROPOELASTIN PROMOTER ASSAY was performed on the following compounds: Tanacetum parthenium (parthenolide-free feverfew extract from Integrated Botanical Technologies of Ossining, NY ), Rubus fruticosus (SymMatrix, from Symrise), cells treated with various preparations of Phyllanthus niruri (Raintree Nutrition, Inc., Carson City, Nevada) subsequently extracted with water and fractionated to include only species with molecular weight less than 100,000 daltons, and 4-hexylresorcinol (Synovea HR, Sytheon Ltd). The compounds were diluted in cell culture media (DMEM Media of Invitrogen, San Diego CA) to the concentration of “active” indicated in Table 3 below. The compounds were added to the transfected H9C2 cells and were incubated for 24 hours. Test samples were compared to a DMSO vehicle. The results are shown in Table 3.

In contrast, the combination of both 4-hexylresorcinol and Tanacetum parthenium demonstrated an 84% improvement in tropelastin promotion over the vehicle control. This was much greater than a mere additive effect in performance. A similar synergistic effect was observed when the concentration of Tanacetum parthenium was raised from 1 ug/ml to 5 ug/ml. Tanacetum parthenium at the higher concentration showed a percent change in tropoelastin promotion over the vehicle control of 59.3%, whereas the combination of 4-hexylresorcinol and Tanacetum parthenium achieved a percent change in tropoelastin promotion over the vehicle control of 1 15.8%. Similarly, 4-hexylresorcinol and Phyllanthus niruri showed percent changes in tropoelastin promotion over the vehicle control of-12% and 18.9%, respectively. The combination of 4-hexylresorcinol and Tanacetum parthenium achieved a synergistic percent change in tropoelastin promotion over the vehicle control of 67.8%. 4-Hexylresorcinol and Rubus fruticosus showed percent changes in tropoelastin promotion over the vehicle control of-12% and 30.4%, respectively, whereas the combination of 4-hexylresorcinol and Rubus fruticosus achieved a percent change in tropoelastin promotion over the vehicle control of 77. 3%. This was much greater what would be expected from a mere additive effect. Additional TROPOELASTIN PROMOTER ASSAYS demonstrated the synergistic effect of another NF-kB inhibitor, Tetrahydrocurcuminoids CG in combination with Tanacetum parthenium. The results are shown in Table 4 below. TABLE 4 Compound/Extract Respective Concentrations of Actives (on active basis) Tropoelastin Promoter Activity Percent Change Over Vehicle Ratio of NFkBInhibitor: Tropoelastin Promoter Vehicle Control ..

The data clearly demonstrates that the combination of an NF-KB inhibitor and tropoelastin promoter produces a surprising and synergistic increase in tropoelastin promotion activity.
