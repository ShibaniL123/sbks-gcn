TITLE Continuous Calibration of A Blood Pressure Measurement Device RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/000,078 entitled "Method of Calibrating a Non-Interfering Continuous Blood Pressure Measurement Device" filed May 19, 2014; U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/072,568 entitled "Continuous Calibration of Non-Interfering Blood Pressure Device" filed October 30, 2014; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/072,601 entitled "A Method of Estimating the Transmural Pressure in an Artery of a Subject with a Non-Interfering Continuous Blood Pressure Measuring Device" filed October 30, 2014, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND [0002] Devices for measuring cardiovascular properties suffer from the problem that the measurement itself interferes strongly with the state of the subject, thereby leading to erroneous results. This is especially the case for current cuff-based methods that may impart a significant physiological impact. In current cuff-based methods, the systolic blood pressure is obtained by completely or at least substantially blocking an artery, which in most cases is the brachial artery in the upper arm. Blocking the artery affects pulse pressure propagation and pulse pressure shapes, which may only be tolerated in the peripheral system. Further, the diastolic pressure is derived from measurements obtained when the transmural pressure (pressure difference between the outside and the inside of an artery) is close to zero, which implies those measurements are made under conditions that are far from normal. [0003] It is also well recognized that traditional methods based on inflatable cuffs and measurements performed in a clinical environment may have strong psychological effects causing elevation of blood pressure. The phenomenon is commonly called "white coat syndrome" or "white coat hypertension." So-called "masked hypertension" is a contrasting phenomenon in which blood pressure is elevated during normal daily activities but not in a medical office setting. [0004] Additionally, blood pressure often exhibits considerable variability over time. Thus, identifying diurnal or other temporary variations in blood pressure may be very important for proper diagnosis of hypertension. It has also recently been shown that performing ambulatory blood pressure measurements is overall cost-effective. [0005] It is therefore desirable to provide a device for measuring blood pressure that does not interfere with the normal bodily functions or at least does not perturb an artery being measured and that may measure blood pressure continuously and over a longer period of time. SUMMARY [0006] The systems, methods, and devices of the various embodiments enable continuous non- invasive monitoring of blood pressure with a minimum of interference. The various embodiments provide methods for measurement calibration in a manner that is suitable for continuous measurements of blood pressure. In such embodiment methods the measured quantity may be related to an arterial lumen or arterial cross sectional area including calibrating the conversion for incremental variations of arterial properties and absolute value adaptation by exploitation of the exponential decay during the diastole. In various embodiments, continuous calibration of a non-interfering blood pressure measurement device may be initiated based on a change in mean arterial pressure being greater than a threshold value, such as a pressure value associated with an actual measured distension of a patient's artery.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0019] The various embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. References made to particular examples and implementations are for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims. [0020] The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any implementation described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. [0021] The terms "computing device" are used herein to refer to any one or all of cellular telephones, smart-phones, web-pads, tablet computers, Internet enabled cellular telephones, Wi-Fi enabled electronic devices, laptop computers, dedicated healthcare electronic devices, personal computers, and similar electronic devices equipped with at least a processor and configured to communicate with an blood pressure measuring device described herein, such as a negligible interfering and negligible perception configuration or form blood pressure measuring device (e.g., a wearable patch, bracelet, anklet, watch, etc.). [0022] The various embodiments provide methods and devices for continuous noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure with a minimum of interference to the measurement. The various embodiments may enable non-interfering measurements of blood pressure. [0023] In various embodiments a blood pressure measuring device may provide an output that varies proportionally with the variations of the cross-sectional area of an artery at a location of the measurement. In some embodiments, the proportionality may be for incremental changes or fluctuations and not for the absolute values because of the bias terms discussed further below. The various embodiments may provide outputs associated with the area or lumen of an artery, and thus to the square of the diameter. Cross-sectional area and lumen (volume) may be proportional because expansion in the direction of the artery may be negligible. The placement of the blood pressure measuring device and/or the location of the measurement may be at any location on a patient, such as a limb (e.g., an arm, a wrist, a finger, etc.). [0024] The various embodiments may measure arterial lumen or cross-sectional area with a bias term. In order to convert such measurements to pressure, the sensitivity of blood pressure measuring device, as well as the arterial stiffness, may be needed and a bias term may be determined. In the various embodiments, variations of the hydrostatic pressure (for example an elevation difference of 60 cm may correspond to a 47 mmHg pressure change, while the Mean Arterial Pressure at heart level may be around 100 mmHg) may be continuously monitored along with outputs from an elevation sensor, such as a 3D accelerometer with measurements integrated in order to detect position changes, a high resolution barometer configured to output the elevation or change in elevation of the measuring location, etc. When the pulse rate is constant, the "driving pulse pressure" may be assumed to be unchanged and the pulse pressure may be assumed to be constant, and thus the only pressure change may be caused by the change of the hydrostatic pressure due to changes in elevation of the measuring location. This presumption that the only cause of the change in pressure is the change of the hydrostatic pressure may enable a method of calibration for incremental changes. [0025] The absolute pressure may be evaluated through analysis of the exponential decay of the diastolic part of the pulse (i.e., the last part of the pulse), which converges towards the vein pressure, generally a few mmHg, a fitting procedure may give the decay constant and the correction to the bias term. Thus, in the various embodiments both pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure may be estimated. Using these estimates, systolic and diastolic pressures may be determined with a temporal resolution unattainable by traditional cuff-based devices and without any interference of the artery on which measurements may be performed. Additionally, the various embodiments may eliminate the need for measuring local Pulse Wave Velocity and arterial diameter to determine blood pressure. [0026] In the various embodiments, variations of the measured quantity may be generally proportional to the variations of the cross-sectional area of the artery, but may include an unknown additive bias term. The proportionality constant and the bias may change, but typically over time scales much longer than the duration of a single pulse. The duration of a single pulse is typically about one second, but the length of a single pulse may vary over time and from individual to individual. [0027] The arterial pressure P and the artery cross-sectional area may be related by a stress-strain relation that generally may be assumed to be exponential. The pressure pulses associated with the beating of the heart may be smaller than the mean pressure and a local linear relation between pressure variations and cross-sectional area variations of the artery can be assumed. The gradient of the relation may define the instantaneous incremental arterial stiffness or elasticity. The stiffness may not be constant, and the stiffness may continuously adapt to the state of the subject (i.e., patient). The response time may typically be in the order of minutes or longer, but may be much shorter in cases of extraordinary changes of the environment to which the subject is exposed. Incremental pressure and lumen changes may be related by the gradient of the stress-strain relation. In general, the lumen and the cross-sectional area of peripheral arteries may be proportional since the variations in the direction of the artery may be negligible: The elastic properties of peripheral arteries may be predominantly given by smooth muscles arranges in a spiral pattern - presumably arranged in such a way that the arterial expansion upon a pressure increase predominantly may be in the radial direction and negligible in the longitudinal direction. [0028] In the various embodiments, the pressure pulse occurring after each contraction of the left heart ventricle can be considered to include three parts. The first part may be the immediate rise of the pressure as a consequence of the ejection from the heart, i.e., the systole phase. The second part may include an exponentially decaying pressure occurring in the diastole phase. The decay may asymptotically approach the venous pressure, which may be only a few mmHg, but may be terminated by the occurrence of the subsequent pulse. The exponential decay may be caused by the arterial system being connected with the veins through capillary network with a high fluid-flow resistivity and the veins being much more elastic than the arteries. Thus, the venous system may essentially behave in a manner that can be represented as a capacitor. Propagation effects may play an insignificant role for the decay since the time constant of the decay may be much larger than the pulse propagation time through the arterial system. The third part may represent reflections from discontinuities in the arterial system such as bifurcations or diameter changes in the arterial system, particularly in the vicinity of a sensor. [0029] In the various embodiments, the pulse rate averaged over time, such as averaged over about one minute of measurements, may play an important role. There may be an inverse relationship between heart rate and central blood pressure, but often a positive correlation is encountered between heart rate and peripheral blood pressure. It may be assumed that if the heart rate is constant - except for the very short term heart rate variability - then the pulse pressure may also be constant and the only change in the measured blood pressure may be caused by a change of the hydrostatic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure affecting the blood pressure in an artery may be exclusively given by the elevation of an arterial segment relative to a reference point if it is assumed that the fluid in the system is incompressible, i.e. its density is constant, and that the gravitation acceleration is constant. The change in hydrostatic pressure Phs encountered by moving a measuring location from one position to another position separated by a distance h in the direction of gravity (i.e., height) may simply be given by: Phs = pgh , where p is the density of the fluid and g is the gravitational acceleration. For example, the difference in hydrostatic pressure at the wrist of an arm of length 60 cm raised to a straight upward position and a horizontal position, respectively, may be 47.4 mmHg, which may be significant relative to the mean arterial pressure at the elevation of the heart (typically around 100 mmHg). The siphon effect may be neglected if the fluid system is terminated into a very high fluid impedance unit, which is the case for most of the arterial systems in which the high resistance capillary network provides the connection from arteries to veins. [0030] The systems, methods, and devices of the various embodiments may enable continuous estimation of blood pressure based on measured electrical impedance (or admittance, i.e., the inverse of impedance) as a function of time. The various embodiments may continuously estimate blood pressure based on measured electrical impedance as a function of time by continuously adapting to changes of the arterial properties of a patient (i.e., subject) in such a way that no special action may be required by the patient and no sensation may be felt by the patient. [0031] In various embodiments, a blood pressure measuring device may initially be calibrated for the correct arterial properties when a measuring session is started. In various embodiments, a blood pressure measuring device may initially be calibrated in any manner that may enable the blood pressure measuring device to be set for the correct arterial properties for a patient at an initial time. For example, a blood pressure measuring device may be calibrated to measure a quantity (X) monotonically related to the cross sectional area (A) of an artery arranged in the vicinity of a sensor of the blood pressure measuring device by: providing a first model that describes the relationship between the output (X) of the sensor and the cross sectional area (A) of the artery and representing the first model with a first equation (A=f(X)) having a first number of unknown parameters; providing a second model that describes the relationship between the cross sectional area (A) of an artery and the transmural pressure (P) in the artery and representing the second model with a second equation (P=g(A)) having a second number of unknown parameters; substituting the first equation (f) into the second equation (g) to get a third equation, P=c(X), representing the relationship between the output of the sensor and the transmural pressure in the artery, the third equation (c) having a number (z) of unknown parameters; attaching the blood pressure measuring device to a limb of a subject such that the sensor is arranged in the vicinity of an artery in the limb of the subject; placing the limb of the subject into z positions so that the measurement location of the sensor arrives at z different heights with regard to a reference height; at each of the z different heights, measuring and recording the average value of the output of the sensor together with the height of the measurement location of the sensor relative to the reference height; and using the known effect of the hydrostatic force on the transmural pressure at the different heights of the measurement location of the sensor to find the unknown parameters of the third equation (c). [0032] In the various embodiments, when a change ' of the measured quantity is observed jointly with a possible change of elevation of the measuring site, the expected change in blood pressure, caused by the change of hydrostatic pressure, may be evaluated. Further, if the change ΔΧ and possible change of elevation of the measuring site occur during a time interval in which the pulse rate is constant, then the only cause of change in blood pressure at the measuring site is the change in hydrostatic pressure. This may provide for an estimate of the current relation between incremental pressure change ΔΡ and incremental change of measured quantity M i.e. for determining k in the equation ΔΡ = k X AX. (1) Knowing the incremental sensitivity, the pulse pressure may be determined based on an exponential stress-strain function and the incremental variation between the two observation times using Eq. (1). The absolute pressure may be obtained by fitting the diastole to the exponential decay function. The fitted exponentially decaying function may asymptotically approach the pressure in the veins. However, the bias of the measured quantity converted to pressure will in general be much larger than the venous pressure. Knowing the asymptotic value of the decay may facilitate an estimate of the absolute pressure. For example, knowing that the asymptotic value should be approximately the vein pressure estimated to within 0-5 mmHg may provide an estimate of the absolute pressure value with an uncertainty equal to the uncertainty of the vein pressure, such as 0-5 mmHg. A complete stress-strain relationship may also be determined by recording a measured quantity at a sequence of different elevations for which the hydrostatic pressure may be evaluated and fit to the exponential relationship of the data. [0033] In the various embodiments, a sensor, such as an arterial measurement sensor, may provide an output, li, that is proportional to the instantaneous arterial cross- sectional area, but that may also include an unknown additive bias term. The variations of the sensor output may provide the equivalent variations of the arterial cross-section. One problem to be solved is to convert the sensor output to properly calibrated blood pressure. The conversion is in general not static because of the varying arterial stiffness. The measuring bias may change as a consequence of movements of the limb on which the measurement is performed, which may correspond to elevation changes at the measurement site. Bias changes may not occur immediately with elevation changes. Rather, in various embodiments bias changes may be assumed to be relatively slow, e.g., on time scales of at least several minutes which may be caused by relatively slow variations of the properties of the veins of a subject. The incremental conversion from sensor signal to lumen may also change as a consequence of changing posture/position of the patient. [0034] In the various embodiments, an elevation sensor may provide an output that may be continuously converted to a measure of the elevation of the measuring location. For example, the elevation sensor may be a 3D inertial sensor such as an accelerometer, where elevation changes may be inferred from integration of the accelerometer output. As other examples, the elevation sensor may be a barometer, magnetic near- field device, or any other type sensor configured to measure of the elevation or changes in elevation of the measuring location. [0035] Individual pulses may exhibit considerable variability both in amplitude, pulse shape and in pulse length. In order to obtain a characteristic pulse, conditional averaging may be applied in various embodiments. A conditional average may be obtained by averaging a set of numbers in which a given condition has to be fulfilled for each of the numbers. In an embodiment, it may be the amplitudes where the first index i represents a fixed time from a reference time of the pulse. The reference time may be defined by the time in which the largest positive slope of the pulse is observed. For example, the reference time may be at the first zero-crossing of the high-pass filtered pulse. If a number of pulses are recorded then the second index may be the pulse number. In an embodiment, each of the i values of a pulse may be averaged over all pulses, that is over . The result may be a pulse representing the average pulse averaged over all the recorded pulses. [0036] In an embodiment, a method for measuring blood pressure may include selecting a location on the body for the measurement, such as a wrist, a finger, or some other location where arteries are identified. The selected location may be fitted with a blood pressure measuring device including an arterial measurement sensor, such as a non-interfering sensing device, which may measure a quantity proportional to the distension of the artery right below the sensor and an elevation sensor, such as a 3D inertial sensor, which may be supported by a tilt sensor. In an embodiment, the outputs of the sensor (e.g., the arterial measurement sensor), and the elevation sensor may be recorded continuously. The pulse rate may be measured and averaged continuously over a sliding window of a width of from 0.5 minute to about 2 minutes. The elevation may be continuously evaluated and averaged over a few seconds. [0037] In an embodiment, sequences with a constant pulse rate may be selected. The mean of the sensor output may be evaluated for these sequences. The incremental sensitivity (or variation) may then be found to be k— ΔΡ^/ΑΚ where ΔΡ is the change in hydrostatic pressure from one observation time to another observation time and Δ3£' is the change of the mean output of the arterial measurement sensor between the two observation times. [0038] In an embodiment, the diastolic parts of measured pulses recorded between the two observation times may be fitted to an exponentially decaying function including an additive bias, i.e. to [0039] The parameter a is defined by the distension amplitude of the diastolic part of the pulse and b is the bias term caused by the possible contributions from tissues other than the artery and by a possible off-set of the measuring electronics. Time is denoted t and the time-constant of the decay is denoted t0 which is given by the resistance of the capillary network connecting artery with veins in conjunction with the capacity of the arteries. [0040] In an embodiment, diastolic parts may be fitted to the exponentially decaying function on each individual pulse and the fitting parameters may then be averaged over a series of pulses, such as 60 pulses or any other number of pulses. Alternatively the fitting may be performed on pulses obtained by conditional averaging over a series of pulses, such as up to 60 pulses. The diastole may be defined as starting at the time instance after the first dip of the pulse in which the second derivative of the measured pulse waveform with respect to time is positive and ending at the onset of the subsequent pulse (see FIG. 5 below). [0041] In an embodiment, the parameters u and k may be converted to pressure parameters by multiplication with k. In an embodiment, the diastolic blood pressure (DBF) may be estimated by evaluation of the first part of Eq. (2) at the end of the diastole (see FIGs. 3 and 5), multiplying with k and adding the vein pressure, which may be assumed to be 4 mmHg with an uncertainty of 2 mmHg. The diastolic blood pressure estimate may be performed on the individual pulses and averaging the values of a number of pulses. The number of pulses may be from one to 60 or more. Generally 60 pulses may be used since short term fluctuations may be minimized and arterial properties may be generally constant over a period of 60 pulses. The diastolic blood pressure estimate may also be obtained from the pulse obtained by conditional averaging. In a similar manner, the pulse pressure (PP) may be simply obtained from Eq. (1) with averaging as described above. [0042] In an embodiment, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) may be given by DB PP. (3) [0043] In an embodiment, the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) may be obtained by finding the mean of the pulse pressures from the start of the systole to the end of the diastole, scaled with k, and with the bias term determined above. Alternatively, the often used approximation may be applied. [0044] In an embodiment, parameters characterizing the relation of pressure to measured signal as defined by Eq. (1) may be determined based on the mean measured signal as recorded at several elevations. The mean measured signal may be a representation of the average signal over a time that may be at least equal to the length of one pulse. A longer time, such as the average signal over a time equal to at least one respiration period, may eliminate the modulation of the blood pressure that is generally caused by respiration. An upper limit for the averaging time may be the time within which the pulse pressure stays constant or the pulse pressure becomes distributed by movement artifacts. This time can be inferred from the variability of the pulse rate. In an embodiment, sets of data representing the hydrostatic pressure relative to the heart level and the sensor averaged output may be recorded for several different elevations, providing a data set [Ph^X^ , where the index i indicates the specific elevation. The parameters that define Eq. (1) may then be obtained by fitting the expression to the data noting that P = Ph Ph rt with Pheart being the MAP at an elevation identical to the elevation of the heart. The MAP may then be defined as Pheart and the pulse pressure, PP, may be determined by measuring the dynamic part &X of the measured quantity X, which may be converted to pressure through Eq. 1. [0045] Continuous measurement instructions to the subject may only be feasible at the initialization of a measuring session, as measuring sessions may last 24 hours or longer. Updating the calibration may be needed in the course of a measuring session, which may be achieved by measuring the distension signal, the pulse rate, and the elevation of the measuring location continuously. In response to determining that the elevation changes with a constant pulse rate and the accordingly calculated change of pressure deviates from a threshold value, such as a pressure value associated with the actual measured distension, an update calibration condition may be determined and the device may enter a calibration mode. [0046] In an embodiment, a sensor exploiting bioimpedance variations and preferably with a tetrapolar configuration and an electrode configuration as disclosed in WO20121 10042A1 may be utilized to determine blood pressure. In another embodiment, electrodes may be applied to a patient placed in a line right on top of the radial artery and aligned with the direction of the selected artery. At the wrist this may be the radial artery or the ulnar artery. A first set of two electrodes may be placed with a separation somewhat larger than the depth at which the artery is embedded in the limb. At the wrist this may be about 1 cm, but the separation may be considerably larger only confined by the length of the limb. A second set of two electrodes may be placed with a closer separation than in the first set and between the electrodes of the first set. The separation of the electrodes of the second set may be at a minimum given by the depth at which the artery is located but preferably larger. At the wrist this may be a separation of from 5 mm to several centimeters. The sizes of the electrodes may be smaller than the separations, such as 1 mm, 2mm, or larger. A current oscillating at a frequency, which may be in the range of 10 kHz to 100 MHz, may be injected into the limb. The magnitude of the current may be in the range of 0.1 μΑ to 2 niA. The field lines associated with the current may be essentially perpendicular close to the skin, because the skin and the subcutaneous fat may have low conductivities. In the artery the electric field lines may become aligned with the direction of the blood filled artery because blood has a relatively high conductivity. [0047] FIG. 1A illustrates an embodiment system 100 including an embodiment blood pressure measuring device 102 placed on a subject 104. In an embodiment, the blood pressure measuring device 102 may include a processor 103 connected to one or more arterial measurement sensors 101, one or more elevation sensor 105, a power source 107, and a radio module 109 connected to an antenna. The one or more arterial measurement sensors 101 may be any type sensor or combination of sensors that may measure arterial properties of the patient 104, either directly or indirectly. As an example, the one or more arterial measurement sensors 101 may be electrical tissue and blood impedance measurement sensors that inject an AC current by one set of electrodes and detect the voltage with another set of electrodes to measure bioimpedance. As another example, the one or more arterial measurement sensors 101 may be optical sensors, such as photoplethysmographic sensors including pulse oximeters. As a further example, the one or more arterial measurement sensors 101 may be ultrasound sensors. As yet another example, the one or more arterial measurement sensors 101 may be surface pressure sensors. As a still further example, the one or more arterial measurement sensors 101 may be impedance sensors, such as impedance plethysmography sensors. The one or more arterial measurement sensors 101 may output measurements of arterial properties to the processor 103 of the blood pressure measurement device 102. The one or more elevation sensors 105 may be any type sensor or combination of sensors that may measure the elevation of the blood pressure measuring device 102 and the limb or other location of the subject 104 to which the blood pressure measuring device 102 may be attached. As examples, the one or more elevation sensors may be three dimensional inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometers, etc.), GPS sensors, etc. The one or more elevation sensors 105 may output elevation measurements to the processor 103 of the blood pressure measurement device 102. [0048] In an embodiment, via the radio module 109 and antenna, the processor 103 of the blood pressure measuring device 102 may establish a wireless connection with a computing device 106, such as a smart phone. In this manner, via the wireless connection with the computing device 106, the processor 103 of the blood pressure measuring device 102 may exchange data with the computing device 106. [0049] In the various embodiments, the blood pressure measuring device 102 may be of any type configuration or form. In an embodiment, the blood pressure measuring device 102 may be a negligible interfering and negligible perception configuration or form device, such as a wearable patch, bracelet, anklet, watch, etc. [0050] FIG. IB is a component block diagram of an embodiment blood pressure measuring device, such as blood pressure measuring device 102 described above with reference to FIG. 1A, illustrating various processing modules of the processor 103. In an embodiment, the blood pressure measuring device illustrated in FIG. IB may measure blood pressure based on bioimpedances. The arterial measurement sensor 101 may include a signal generator, such as an oscillator, configured to apply an excitation signal, such as an oscillating current, sinusoidal current, etc., via excitation electrodes to an object, such as an artery, and detection electrodes to measure the resulting voltage and provide the voltage to the processor 103. The elevation sensor 105 may comprise an inertial sensor that may be configured to output acceleration measurements to the processor 103. [0051] In an embodiment, the processor 103 of the blood pressure measuring device illustrated in FIG. IB may measure bioimpedances by controlling the arterial measurement sensor 101 to apply an oscillating current to the excitation electrodes. Outputs from the processor may be pulses and MAP in units of mmHg or in some other selected pressure unit. For example, the pulses and MAP may be transmitted from the processor 103 via a radio module to a computing device, such as a smartphone, for further processing and/or display. [0052] In an embodiment, the data from the inertial sensor may be supported by signals from a level detector in such a way that the first and last positions require a vertical orientation of the arm (limb), and the measurement between requires a horizontal orientation. FIG. 2 illustrates movement of a subject's limb and an embodiment blood pressure measuring device 102 moving from a first elevation in an upward vertical orientation (21) to a second elevation in a horizontal orientation (22), to a third elevation in a straight downward vertical orientation (23). [0053] FIG. 3A is a graph of a stress-strain relationship for an artery. FIG. 3 A defines the quantities that may be inferred by the various embodiments, including Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Pulse Pressure (PP), SP, MAP, Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), Distension, δΑ, and <A>. FIG. 3B is a graph of a stress-strain relationship for an artery and illustrates transmural pressure P versus a measured quantity X respectively. [0054] FIG. 4 is a graph of changes in a stress-strain relationship of an artery with tightening or relaxation of the smooth muscles in the artery wall. FIG. 4 illustrates how the stress-strain relation may change with changing tightness of the smooth muscles. [0055] FIG. 5 is a graph of pressure versus time for a pressure pulse. FIG. 5 illustrates a typical pressure pulse with the onset in the systolic phase and the exponential decay in the last part of the diastolic phase until the next pulse occurs. A measured impedance variation may, in general, have a large bias. In FIG. 5 the signal was high- pass filtered, which may remove the baseline. While the bias may be eliminated by high-pass filtering, but this may not provide the correct asymptotic value for the decay. [0056] FIG. 6A is a graph of a pulse pressure 20 showing the changes in pressure (i.e., the vertical axis, measured in mmHg) over time (i.e., the horizontal axis, measured in sec/100). Pressure pulses occur after each contraction of the left heart ventricle and are considered as having three parts. A first part Si, referred to as the systolic phase, reflects the immediate rise of the pressure as a consequence of the ejection from the heart. [0057] The second part Dj, referred to as the diastolic phase, reflects the fall of the pressure after the systolic phase. The diastolic phase is generally characterized by an exponentially decaying pressure. The exponential decay asymptotically approaches the venous pressure, but is redirected before doing so upon the occurrence of the subsequent pulse, which starts the next pulse's systolic phase S2. The exponential decay may be caused by the arterial system being connected with the veins through capillary network with a high fluid- flow resistivity and the veins being much more elastic than the arteries. Thus, the venous system may essentially behave like a capacitor. Propagation effects may play an insignificant role for the decay since a time-constant of the decay may be much larger than the pulse propagation time through the arterial system. [0058] The pulse pressure 20 also includes reflections R, considered the third part, that result from discontinuities in the arterial system, such as bifurcations or diameter changes, particularly near a sensor. [0059] FIG. 6B is a graph of another pulse pressure 21 showing the changes in pressure (i.e., the vertical axis, measured in mmHg) over time (i.e., the horizontal axis, measured in sec/100) during a diastolic phase and part of a subsequent systolic phase. Superimposed on the pulse pressure 21 is a decaying exponential function ΡΕΟ/(Ϊ), expressing the exponential decay of the pulse pressure 21 during and extended well beyond the diastolic phase. [0060] FIG. 7 illustrates an embodiment method 700 for continuously estimating blood pressures based on incremental variations of arterial properties. In an embodiment, the operations of method 700 may be performed by a processor of a blood pressure measuring device, such as blood pressure measuring device 102 described above. In another embodiment, the operations of the method 700 may be performed by a processor of a computing device, such as a computing device 106 described above, in communication with a blood pressure measuring device, such as blood pressure measuring device 102 described above. In an embodiment, the operations of method 700 may be performed by a processor after an initial calibration procedure to set the correct arterial properties for the blood pressure measuring device when a measuring session is started. [0061] In block 702 the processor may measure pulses, estimate hydrostatic pressure, and elevation at a location of measurement on the body of a patient, such as wrist, finger, or some other location where arteries are identified. In various embodiments, the processor may measure pulses, estimate hydrostatic pressure, and elevation based on outputs from one or more sensors, such as an arterial measurement sensor and elevation sensor. In various embodiments, the pulses, hydrostatic pressures, and elevation may be obtained continuously. In various embodiments, elevation may be averaged over a period of a few seconds and the pulses and hydrostatic pressure may be averaged over that same period. In various embodiments, the pulses may continuously be recorded as they occur, and the pulse rate may be measured and averaged over a sliding window, such as a thirty second window to about a two minute window. [0062] In block 704 the processor may store the measured pulses, hydrostatic pressures, and elevations and/or their averaged measurements corresponding to an observation period. For example, the processor may store the measured pulses, hydrostatic pressures, and elevations and/or their averaged measurements in a memory, such as a database of measured pulses, hydrostatic pressures, and elevations and/or their averaged measurements for different observation periods. [0063] In determination block 706 the processor may determine whether a change in measured values of the artery (e.g., measured values associated with a change in distension and/or cross sectional area of the artery) and elevation both occurred from the last observation. In an embodiment, the processor may compare the measured values or average measurements thereof for the most recent observation time to the measured values or average measurements thereof for the previous observation time to determine whether any change has occurred in the measured values and may compare the elevation of the measurement location from the most recent observation time to the elevation of the measurement location from the previous observation time to determine whether any change has occurred in the elevation. For example, when a change in elevation of the measurement location occurs, the distension of an artery measured at the different elevations may be different, and the change in elevation and measured values may both be determined by comparing the most recent observation and previous observation. In response to determining that no change has occurred in either the distension or the elevation (i.e., determination block 706 = "No"), the processor may continue to measure pulses, hydrostatic pressure, distension of the artery, and elevation in block 702. [0064] In response to determining that a change has occurred in both the distension and the elevation (i.e., determination block 706 = "Yes"), the processor may determine whether a change in pulse rate between observation times has occurred in determination block 708. A change in elevation of the measurement location and distension without a change in pulse rate may indicate that the only reason for a change in blood pressure is the change in hydrostatic pressure which may provide an estimate of the current relationship between incremental pressure change and incremental change of measured quantities. In response to determining that a change has occurred in pulse rate (i.e., determination block 708 = "Yes"), the processor may continue to measure pulses, hydrostatic pressure, distension of the artery, and elevation in block 702. [0065] In response to determining that a change has not occurred in pulse rate (i.e., determination block 708 = "No"), the processor may determine an incremental variation between observations in block 710. In an embodiment, the variation may be found to be k —■ &P s/&X where Pfe is the change in hydrostatic pressure from one observation time to another observation time and &% is the change of the mean output of the arterial measurement sensor between the two observation times. As discussed above, the two different observation times are associated with two different elevations of the measurement location. In an embodiment, the processor may determine an incremental variation between observations by performing two calculations and comparing the results. The first calculation may determine the expected pressure change caused by a change in the elevation of the measurement location based on the previous calibration and distension changes, and the second calculation may determine the change in hydrostatic pressure. The processor may compare the expected pressure change caused by the measurement location elevation change based on the previous calibration and distension to the change in hydrostatic pressure changes. In response to determining that the pressure changes are different, the processor may determine a new calibration is needed, and the new calibration may be obtained from the hydrostatic pressure and the change in the measured quantity averaged over at least one pulse. The "baseline" may then be estimated by the processor using exponential fitting. [0066] In block 712 the processor may determine the pulse pressure (PP). In an embodiment, the pulse pressure (PP) may be simply obtained from Eq. (1) with averaging the values of a number of pulses. The number of pulses may be from one to 60 or more. For general use 60 pulses may be used since short term fluctuations may be minimized and arterial properties may be generally constant. In the various embodiments pulse pressure may be determined based at least in part on an exponential stress-strain function and the incremental variation between the two observation times [0067] In block 714, the processor may determine a coefficient for adjusting a stress- strain relationship of the measured artery by curve fitting an exponential decay function to estimated pulse pressures, corresponding to the diastolic phase of a pulse, in order to determining a coefficient for the exponential decay function characterizing the observed decay in pressure. For example, the processor may fit the diastolic parts of the measured pulses between the observation times to an exponentially decaying function and determine the pressure parameters. In other words the processor may determine a coefficient fitting select ones of the estimated pulse pressures corresponding to the diastolic phase fitting an exponentially decaying function including an additive bias representing an exponential decay of a part of a diastolic phase to measured pulses between two observation times. In an embodiment, the diastolic parts of measured pulses recorded between the two observation times may be fitted to an exponentially decaying function including an additive bias, such as Eq. (2) described above. In an embodiment, diastolic parts may be fitted to the exponentially decaying function on each individual pulse and the fitting parameters (e.g., coefficients of the exponentially decaying function) may then be averaged over a series of pulses, such as 60 pulses. Alternatively the fitting may be performed on pulses obtained by conditional averaging over a series of pulses, such as up to 60 pulses. The diastole may be defined as starting at the time instance where the second derivative of the measured pulse waveform with respect to time is positive and ending at the onset of the subsequent pulse. In an embodiment, the parameters and b may be converted to pressure parameters by multiplication with k. In an embodiment, fitting the diastolic parts of measured pulses between the observation times to an exponential function including an additive bias may result in absolute calibration of the blood pressure measuring device. [0068] In block 716 the processor may determine the diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In an embodiment, the parameters a and b of Eq. (2) may be converted to pressure parameters by multiplication with k. In an embodiment, the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) may be estimated by evaluation of the first part of Eq. (2) at the end of the diastole, multiplying with and adding the vein pressure, which may be assumed to be 4 mmHg with an uncertainty of 2 mmHg. The diastolic blood pressure estimate may be performed on the individual pulses and averaging the values of a number of pulses. The number of pulses may be from one to 60 or more. For general use 60 pulses may be used since short term fluctuations may be minimized and arterial properties may be generally constant. The diastolic blood pressure estimate may also be obtained from the pulse obtained by conditional averaging. [0069] In block 718 the processor may determine systolic blood pressure (SBP). In an embodiment, systolic blood pressure may be determined according to Eq. (3) described above. [0070] In block 720 the processor may determine Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). In an embodiment, the MAP may be obtained by finding the mean of the pulse pressures from the start of the systole to the end of the diastole, scaled with k, and a corrective bias term determined by fitting to the exponential decay of the diastole. In another embodiment, the approximation described above in Eq. (4) may be used to determine the MAP. [0071] In determination block 722, the processor may determine whether a change in MAP between observations is greater than a threshold. The threshold value may be a predetermined value stored in a memory and may be associated with a varying condition of the subject. For example, the threshold may be a pressure value associated with an actual measured distension. The processor may determine whether the change in MAP is greater than a threshold by subtracting the MAP determined in block 720 from a previously determined MAP and comparing the determined change in MAP to a threshold value associated with the distension of the artery measured in block 702. In response to determining that the change in MAP is at or below the threshold (i.e., determination block 722 = "No"), the processor may continue to measure pulses, hydrostatic pressure, distension of the artery, and elevation in block 702. [0072] In response to determining that the change in MAP is greater than the threshold (i.e., determination block 722 = "Yes"), the processor may calibrate the blood pressure measuring device in block 724. For example, the processor may signal or control the blood pressure measuring device to enter a calibration mode. Additionally, in calibrating the blood pressure measuring device, the processor may update calibration values stored in a memory based on the measured change in hydrostatic pressure, or averages of the measured changes in hydrostatic pressure, between observation times. Upon calibrating the blood pressure measuring device the processor may continue to measure pulses, hydrostatic pressure, distension of the artery, and elevation in block 702. [0073] An embodiment blood pressure measuring device may be configured to transmit data to any of a variety of computing devices. For example, FIG. 8 illustrates a computing device 800 suitable for use in various embodiments. The computing device 800 may exchange data to and/or from the blood pressure measuring devices discussed above, such as blood pressure measuring device 102, and may perform one or more of the operations of method 700 described above. For example, DBP, PP, SBP, MAP, and/or measured pulses, hydrostatic pressure, measurements of an artery (e.g., measurements related to distension and/or cross sectional area of an artery), and/or elevation may be sent from the blood pressure measuring device to the computing device 800.
