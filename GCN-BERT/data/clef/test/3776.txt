Step 4: Preparation of 1-(4-chloro-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-yl)ethane-1-one
3.82 g (20.0 mmol) of 1-(4,6-dichloropyrimidine-5-yl)ethane-1-one was dissolved in 30 mL of dichloromethane, which was cooled down to 0Â° C., to which 3.88 g (30.0 mmol) of diisopropylethylamine and 3.29 g (24.0 mmol) of p-methoxybenzylamine (PMBNH2) were added stepwise. 1 hour later, the reaction mixture was heated to room temperature, followed by stirring at room temperature for 6 hours. Water and ethylacetate were added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent:
hexane/ethylacetate, 3/1) to give 5.54 g of the target compound 1-(4-chloro-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-yl)ethane-1-one as a white solid (19.0 mmol, yield: 95%).
